ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. BONAUTO

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1
MS. BONAUTO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The intimate and committed relationships of

12

same­sex couples, just like those of heterosexual

13

couples, provide mutual support and are the foundation

14

of family life in our society.

15

responsibility and protection that is marriage is off

16

limits to gay people as a class, the stain of

17

unworthiness that follows on individuals and families

18

contravenes the basic constitutional commitment to equal

19

dignity.

20

If a legal commitment,

Indeed, the abiding purpose of the

21

Fourteenth Amendment is to preclude relegating classes

22

of persons to second­tier status.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with the

24

Windsor case where the court stressed the Federal

25

government's historic deference to States when it comes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1
2

to matters of domestic relations?
MS. BONAUTO:

States do have primacy over

3

domestic relations except that their laws must respect

4

the constitutional rights of persons, and Windsor

5

couldn't have been clearer about that.

6

a whole class of people who are denied the equal right

7

to be able to join in this very extensive government

8

institution that provides protection for families.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And here we have

Well, you say join

10

in the institution.

11

that they're seeking to redefine the institution.

12

definition that I looked up, prior to about a dozen

13

years ago, defined marriage as unity between a man and a

14

woman as husband and wife.

15

that core definition will no longer be operable.

16

The argument on the other side is

MS. BONAUTO:

Every

Obviously, if you succeed,

I hope not, Your Honor,

17

because of what we're really talking about here is a

18

class of people who are, by State laws, excluded from

19

being able to participate in this institution.

20

Your Honor's question is about does this really draw a

21

sexual orientation line ­­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

And if

My question is

23

you're not seeking to join the institution, you're

24

seeking to change what the institution is.

25

fundamental core of the institution is the opposite­sex

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

6
1

relationship and you want to introduce into it a

2

same­sex relationship.

3

MS. BONAUTO:

Two points on that, Your

4

Honor.

5

fundamental right to marry as a core male­female

6

institution, I think when we look at the Fourteenth

7

Amendment, we know that it provides enduring guarantees

8

in that what we once viewed as the role of women, or

9

even the role of gay people, is something that has

To the extent that if you're talking about the

commentators and ­­ and the bar and the public to ­­ to

5

engage in it.

6

know how to count the decimals when we talk about

millennia.

This definition has been with us for

8

millennia.

And it ­­ it's very difficult for the Court

9

to say, oh, well, we ­­ we know better.

10

But still, 10 years is ­­ I don't even

MS. BONAUTO:

Well, I don't think this is a

11

question of the Court knowing better.

12

about the debate, the place of gay people in our civic

13

society is something that has been contested for more

14

than a century.

15

immigration exclusions, the place of gay people in

16

public employment and Federal service, these are all

17

things that have been contested and ­­ and you can ­­

18

you can say 10 years of marriage for Massachusetts, but

19

it's also in the 1970s that the Baker case from

20

Minnesota reached this Court, and that's over 40 years

21

ago.

22

When we think

And in this ­­ in the last century,

And it was over 20 years ago that the Hawaii

23

24

favor of marriage, and the American people have been

2

families live in communities as neighbors throughout

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

Michigan law limiting marriage to a man and a woman was

7

to demean gay people; is that correct?

8
9

MS. BONAUTO:

The Michigan ­­ the Michigan

statute and amendment certainly went out of their way to

10

say that gay people were in some sense antithetical to

11

the good of society.

I think it has that effect,

I do.

Now, at the same time ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that true just in

18

Michigan or is that true of ­­ of every other State that

19

has a similar definition of marriage?

I think the common commonality among all of the

2

statutes, whether they were enacted long ago or more

3

recently, is that they encompass moral judgments and

4

stereotypes about gay people.

5

something 100 years ago, gay people were not worthy of

the concern of the government and the ­­ and ­­ and

7

moral judgments about ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even if you think about

Well, how do you account for

9

the fact that, as far as I'm aware, until the end of the

10

20th century, there never was a nation or a culture that

11

recognized marriage between two people of the same sex?

12

Now, can we infer from that that those nations and those

13

cultures all thought that there was some rational,

14

practical purpose for defining marriage in that way or

15

is it your argument that they were all operating

16

independently based solely on irrational stereotypes and

17

prejudice?

18

MS. BONAUTO:

Your Honor, my position is

19

that times can blind.

example of sex discrimination and what it ­­ again, I

21

assume it was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but

this and a practical reason for this?

12

MS. BONAUTO:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you wouldn't be

18

asking for this relief if the law of marriage was what

19

it was a millennium ago.

20

Same­sex unions would not have opted into the pattern of

21

marriage, which was a relationship, a dominant and a

22

subordinate relationship.

23

a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple

24

would be domiciled; it was her obligation to follow him.

25

I mean, it wasn't possible.

Yes, it was marriage between

And same­sex unions wouldn't ­­ wouldn't

MS. BONAUTO:

That's correct.

I mean, for

5

centuries we had ­­ we had and ­­ and Europe had this

6

coverture system where a woman's legal identity was

7

absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had

different prescribed legal roles.

10

gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of

fit quite well.

situation.

accountable for those definitions and any exclusions

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

5

to the question you've been asked several times.

6

MS. BONAUTO:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
And to me, it takes the

8

form, the opposite view has been the law everywhere for

9

thousands of years among people who were not

10

discriminating even against gay people, and suddenly you

11

want nine people outside the ballot box to require

12

States that don't want to do it to change what you've

13

heard is change what marriage is to include gay people.

14

Why cannot those States at least wait and see whether in

15

fact doing so in the other States is or is not harmful

16

to marriage?

17

Now, that same question has been put in

18

many, many ways in the briefs on our subject.

You've

19

received it in three or four different ways.

I would

20

like to know, so I can hear and understand it, just what

21

your response is.

22
23

MS. BONAUTO:

Okay.

And I apologize if I

haven't.

In our system, you know, with the Fourteenth

25

Amendment, which again is ­­ sets forth principles that

of denying them the same right?

MS. BONAUTO:

What would be the logic

Number one, I assume the

5

States would rush in and say that when you're talking

6

about multiple people joining into a relationship, that

7

that is not the same thing that we've had in marriage,

8

which is on the mutual support and consent of two

9

people.

10

Setting that aside, even assuming it is within

the fundamental right ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

But ­­ well, I don't know

12

what kind of a distinction that is because a marriage

13

between two people of the same sex is not something that

14

we have had before, recognizing that is a substantial

15

break.

16

that a greater break?

17

Maybe it's a good one.

MS. BONAUTO:

So this is no ­­ why is

The question is one of ­­

18

again, assuming it's within the fundamental right, the

19

question then becomes one of justification.

20

assume that the States would come in and they would say

21

that there are concerns about consent and coercion.

22

there's a divorce from the second wife, does that mean

23

the fourth wife has access to the child of the second

talking about two consenting adults who want to make

5

that mutual commitment for as long as they shall be.

that's my answer on that.

And just if I may turn for a moment to the

waiting and seeing is we're talking about ­­ we're

13

talking about the Petitioners being denied marriage.

14

And we're talking about a second class status being

15

tried as a matter of the Constitution ­­

16

So

And what we're talking about here with

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, part of wait and

17

see, I suppose, is to ascertain whether the social

18

science, the new studies are accurate.

19

seems to me, then, that we should not consult at all the

20

social science on this, because it's too new.

You think

21

­­ you say we don't need to wait for changes.

So it

22

seems to me that if we're not going to wait, then it's

23

only fair for us to say, well, we're not going to

24

consult social science.

25

MS. BONAUTO:

But that ­­ it

Well, two points on that, if I

may.

2

waiting is not neutral, it does consign same­sex couples

3

to this outlier status, and there will be profound

4

consequences that follow from that.

5

In terms of waiting, I do think the effect of

I mean,

People feel very differently about something

MS. BONAUTO:

Well, there's a few points

there, and I hope I get them all.

With respect to

10

Maine, one thing that separates Maine from the States

11

that we're talking about here is that there wasn't a

12

constitutional amendment in place that really largely

13

shuts down the process.

14

to amend the Constitution, and an opinion poll is not a

15

measure in any way of what a legislature is going to do

voters.

problems that did not apply in a place like Maine.

It is extraordinarily difficult

So there ­­ there are some serious structural

And in terms of acceptance, when I think

20

about acceptance, I think about the nation as a whole,

21

and the ­­ and there are places where, again, there are

22

no protections, virtually no protections for gay and

23

lesbian people in employment, in parenting.

the Michigan Petitioners, for example, are not allowed

MS. BONAUTO:

Is it conceivable

Your Honor, of course the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The opportunity to marry is integral to

13

human dignity.

14

marriage demeans the dignity of these couples.

15

demeans their children, and it denies the ­­ both the

16

couples and their children the stabilizing structure

17

that marriage affords.

18

Excluding gay and lesbian couples from
It did

Now, the Respondents' principal argument,

19

and what we've been discussing this morning so far, is

20

whether this issue of ­­ whether this discrimination

21

should persist is something that should be left to the

22

political process or whether it should be something

23

decided by the Court.

24

about that, if I could.

25

And I'd like to make three points

First, the ­­ I think it's important to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

understand that if this Court concludes that this issue

2

should be left to the political process, what the Court

3

will be saying is that the demeaning, second­class

4

status that gay and lesbian couples now inhabit in ­­ in

5

States that do not provide for marriage is consistent

6

with the equal protection of the laws.

7

wait­and­see.

8
9

That is not a

That is a validation.

And second, to the extent that the thought
is that this can be left to the political process

10

because this issue will take care of itself over time,

11

because attitudes are changing, what I respectfully

12

submit to the Court is that although no one can see the

13

future perfectly, of course, that it seems much more

14

likely to me that the outcome that we're going to end up

15

with is something that will approximate the nation as a

16

house divided that we had with de jure racial

17

segregation.

18

States, in which gay couples can live with equal dignity

19

and status, but you will have a minority of States in

20

which gay couples will be relegated to demeaning,

21

second­class status, and I don't know why we would want

22

to repeat that history.

23

And third ­­

I'm sorry.

You may have many States, perhaps most

But, General, I ­­

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And third, I want to

2

expand on what Ms. Bonauto said, that ­­ that ­­ and I

3

think you, Mr. Chief Justice, you did recognize this,

4

that the decision to leave this to the political process

5

is going to impose enormous costs that this Court

6

thought were costs of constitutional stature in Windsor.

7

Thousands and thousands of people are going to live out

8

their lives and go to their deaths without their States

9

ever recognizing the equal dignity of their

10
11

relationships.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you could have said

12

the same thing 10 years ago or so when we had Lawrence.

13

Haven't we learned a tremendous amount since ­­ well,

14

since Lawrence, just in the last 10 years?

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

And, Your Honor, I

16

actually think that's quite a critical point that goes

17

to the questions that Your Honor was asking earlier.

18

do think Lawrence was an important catalyst that has

19

brought us to where we are today.

20

Lawrence did was provide an assurance that gay and

21

lesbian couples could live openly in society as free

22

people and start families and raise families and

23

participate fully in their communities without fear.

24
25

I

And I think what

And there are ­­ two things flow from that,
I think.

One is that has brought us to the point where

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

we understand now, in a way even that we did not fully

2

understand in Lawrence, that gay and lesbian people and

3

gay and lesbian couples are full and equal members of

4

the community.

5

and proper reasons for ostracizing and marginalizing gay

6

people, we now understand do not justify that kind of

7

impression.

8
9

And what we once thought of as necessary

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The difference, of

course, is Lawrence, the whole argument is the State

10

cannot intrude on that personal relationship.

11

seems to me, is ­­ is different in that what the

12

argument is is the State must sanction.

13

that relationship.

14

This, it

It must approve

They're two different questions.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It is different, I agree.

15

And I ­­ and it leads to the second thing I think that

16

the ­­ that the Lawrence catalyzed for our society, was

17

it put gay and lesbian couples, gay and lesbian people,

18

in a position for the first time in our history to be

19

able to lay claim to the abiding promise of the

20

Fourteenth Amendment in a way that was just impossible

21

when they were marginalized and ostracized.

22

And you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, this is

23

about equal participation, participation on equal terms

24

in a State­conferred ­­ a State­conferred status, a

25

State institution.

That is different than Lawrence, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

I do think that what Lawrence has allowed us to see is

2

that the justifications for excluding gay and lesbian

3

couples from equal participation in this institution

4

just hold up.

5

And I do think ­­ and the Court has raised

6

this question about whether what we are talking about

7

here is a ­­ is a fundamental change in the nature of

8

marriage.

9

that this case can be decided by thinking about marriage

And I think the answer to that question is

10

in exactly the way the States ­­ the Respondent States

11

and other States have defined marriage now.

12

And I think it's important to think about it

13

this way.

14

they can have families through biological procreation.

15

They can have families through assisted reproduction.

16

They can have families through adoption, or they can not

17

have families at all.

elements of marriage as it exists today?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think the

23

essential elements of marriage are the ones that are ­­

that ­­ the ­­ the obligations of mutual support and

25

responsibility and the benefits surrounding marriage

the way in which childbearing ­­ bearing is bound up in

14

is something more fundamental than that.

follow up in a line of questioning that Justice Scalia

3

started.

4

We have a concession from your friend that

5

clergy will not be required to perform same­sex

6

marriage, but there are going to be harder questions.

7

Would a religious school that has married housing be

8

required to afford such housing to same­sex couples?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I guess what I'd ­­ I'd

10

like to make three points about that, if I could,

Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the first

part ­­
GENERAL VERRILLI:

And I will ­­ and I'll go

right at the question you asked.
The first one is, of course, this Court's

17

ruling addresses what the States must do under the

18

Fourteenth Amendment.

19

And the ­­ and the second point is that when

20

you get to a question like the one Your Honor asked,

21

that is going to depend on how States work out the

22

balance between their civil rights laws, whether they

23

decide that there's going to be civil rights enforcement

24

of discrimination based on sexual orientation or not,

25

and how they decide what kinds of accommodations they

4

are going to allow under State law.
And they could well ­­ you know, different
states could strike different balances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about

5

Federal ­­ it's a Federal question if we make it a

6

matter of constitutional law.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But the question of

8

what ­­ how States use their enforcement power is up to

9

the States.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

enforcement power, too.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, you have

Right.

And ­­

13

and ­­ well, that's certainly true, but there is no

14

Federal law now generally banning discrimination based

15

on sexual orientation, and that's where those issues are

16

going to have to be worked out.

17

And I guess the third point I would make,

18

Your Honor, is that these issues are going to arise no

19

matter which way you decide this case, because these

20

questions of accommodation are going to arise in

21

situations in States where there is no same­sex

22

marriage, where there are ­­ and, in fact, they have

23

arisen many times.

There ­­ there are these commitment

commitment ceremonies are going to need florists and

JUSTICE ALITO:

That arose out of a

Well, in the Bob Jones case,

7

the Court held that a college was not entitled to

8

tax­exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or

9

interracial dating.

10
11

So would the same apply to a

university or a college if it opposed same­sex marriage?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

You know, I ­­ I don't

12

think I can answer that question without knowing more

13

specifics, but it's certainly going to be an issue.

14

I ­­ I don't deny that.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Justice Kennedy, forgive

me for answering the question this way.

3

We do recognize that there's a profound

connection between liberty and equality, but the United

6

We haven't made the fundamental rights argument under

14

15

reasons like the ones implicit in the Chief Justice's

Obviously, same­sex partners cannot procreate

MR. BURSCH:

Well, a 70­year­old man,

obviously, is still capable of having children and you'd

like keep that within the marriage.

14

But leaving that aside, what you're talking

15

about, Justice Ginsburg, is ­­ is a tailoring issue

16

under rational basis, which we submit applies here.

17

Vance and Heller both say that overinclusiveness is not

18

something you need to worry about.

19

But even if you applied some kind of

20

heightened scrutiny, you know, again, many people get

21

married thinking that they can't have kids or won't have

22

kids, and they end up with children, and that the

inclusion of those couples advances the State's interest

because of this greater idea.

MR. BURSCH:

it's going to exclude people who don't want children.

it seems to me it flows directly from your argument that

people want to have children, and they do.

I ­­ because I think we can accept that

14

MR. BURSCH:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

Sure.
So it's ­­ I'm not certain

how that works here, but I'll think about it.
The other thing I ­­ that you will have a

18

view on, and will be helpful to me, is there is an

19

argument being made, if not by the government ­­ and I'd

20

like your response to it ­­ that after all, marriage is

21

about as basic a right as there is; that the

22

Constitution and Amendment Fourteen does say you cannot

23

deprive a person of liberty, certainly of basic liberty,

24

without due process of law; and that to take a group of

25

people where so little distinguishes them from the

1

people you give the liberty to, at least in terms of

2

a ­­ of a good reason for not to, and you don't let them

3

participate in this basic institution, that that

4

violates the Fourteenth Amendment.

5

Now, the reason that I'm interested in that

6

is we don't get into this more scholastic effort to

7

distinguish between rational basis and middle tier and

8

some higher tier and so forth.

9

get into all these questions of balancing free religion

And it's not going to

10

rights versus gay rights and so forth.

11

in this case.

12

required, which it may be.

response to that aspect of the other side's argument.

14

We'd avoid that

And perhaps that's wise, if not legally

MR. BURSCH:

And so I'd like your

I think with respect to the

15

right of privacy which you identify, this Court already

16

It wasn't a right of

23

has existed for all of human civilization, that that is

24

the right which is fundamental.

25

And, therefore, when a

group ­­ I'm just repeating myself, but that ­­ I ­­ I

2

want that question answered to the best of your ability,

3

please.

4

MR. BURSCH:

I'm using right to privacy

5

interchangeably with the fundamental right that you're

6

speaking about.

7

the limitation of marriage to opposite­sex couples has

8

always been thought to be fundamental.

Okay.

Now, we'll deal with my hypothetical,

And on that assumption, I

would like to know what you think of the argument.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ I ­­ you know, the

problem is that I don't actually accept your starting

premise.

The right to marriage is, I think, embedded in

our constitutional law.

2

We've said it in a number of cases.

It is a fundamental right.

say, but is gay marriage fundamental?

have here.
But ­­ but even more fundamentally than

12

that, this Court has recognized in Nguyen v. INS that

13

it's appropriate to draw lines based on sex if it's

14

related to biology.

15

minute, the Nguyen case really is important here.

16

You'll recall that's the case where you had a law that

17

determined citizenship of children born to divorced

18

or ­­ or unmarried individuals overseas.

19

said if it was the child of a citizen mother, then they

20

automatically had citizenship, but if it was the father,

21

then the father had to, one, prove paternity and, two,

22

make child support payments up to age 18.

23

obvious sex discrimination.

And if you'll indulge me just for a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the law

And that's an

And the Court said ­­
Well, the Court ­­ the ­­

the Court ­­ the Court's rationale for that was we know

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63

who the mother is.

2

claiming to be the father for some benefits that he's

3

going to get from that status, but we can't be sure he

4

is the father.

5

We're fearful that the father is

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

Justice Ginsburg, that

6

was the justification for the prove the parenthood.

7

I would like to ­­ to quote from the opinion about the

8

second interest, the ­­ the child support.

9

But

The Court said that the government had an

10

important interest in ensuring an opportunity to have a

11

meaningful parent­child relationship between that

12

biological father and a child.

13

substantially advanced that interest, and this is why,

14

and I'm going to quote.

15

And the law

"It is almost axiomatic that a policy which

16

seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful

17

parent­child bonds to develop has a close and

18

substantial bearing on the governmental interest in the

19

actual formation of that bond."

20

And that is the exact same interest that the

21

Respondents are advancing here when they talk about the

22

definition of marriage, which from ­­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not ­­ it ­­ in the

24

Nguyen case, the father could get the status of a

25

parent.

He just had to do some things that the mother

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

64
1

didn't have to do.

2

It wasn't difficult.

Here it's a total exclusion.

And in the

3

Nguyen case, the ­­ the father was complaining that he

4

shouldn't have to do anything other than what a mother

5

did, and the Court said, yeah, you do have to do

6

something.

7

It's not much.

MR. BURSCH:

But ­­ but the gist of the

8

Court's opinion, Justice Ginsburg, was that the State

9

had an interest in the biological father­child bond, not

10

only improving it, but also ensuring that it's

11

sustained.

12

States have when they try to inextricably bind kids to

13

their biological moms and dads.

14

change that meaning, over the long haul, it has

15

consequences.

16

minutes ago that the out­of­wedlock birth rate in this

17

country has gone from 10 percent to 40 percent from 1970

you're changing the meaning of marriage ­­

I ­­ I think the argument

Well, what ­­ what I'm

the basic point where you began where you had some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

66

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you see, this is what

2

I think is ­­ is difficult for some people with your

3

argument, is that it's hard to see how permitting

4

same­sex marriage discourages people from being bonded

5

with their biological children.

6

that to me.

7

MR. BURSCH:

So if you would explain

Because if you're changing the

8

meaning of marriage from one where it's based on that

9

biological bond to one where it's based on emotional

10

commitment, then adults could think, rightly, that this

11

relationship is more about adults and not about the

12

kids.

13

We all agree that they are bonded to their kids and have

14

their best interest at heart.

15

Not the case with the Plaintiffs in this case.

But when we're talking about, Justice

16

Kennedy, over decades, when laws change, when societal

views on marriage change, there are consequences to

18

that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. BONAUTO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1

First, I just want to say that

the idea that the ideas of marriage will change is a

9

false dichotomy.

Right now, different­sex couples can

10

choose to marry and rear children.

11

marry at 70 or 90 because of their commitment to one

other.

13

couples who are foreclosed from marrying under either

vision.

We honor both marriages.

They can choose to

It is only same­sex

Second, we agree that these restrictions

are, in fact, linked to gender.

classification here, and they are sex linked in an

18

additional way, and that is ideas about what is a proper

relationship for a man to have, a real man or a real

20

woman, and that is obviously not with a person of the

21

same sex.

There's official

22

I hear that Michigan loves adoption, and, in

23

fact, Michigan has placed intensely vulnerable children

24

with these petitioners who have nurtured them to a

25

healthy childhood.

Does Michigan deny the marriage

20

talking about at the foundation here are different adult

points about procreation and biology and so on is when I

say that what they care about is people who have

5

children together staying together and providing a

6

long­term, stable situation for their children.

7

And they

That interest applies full force in this

8

context, because by denying marriage to same­sex

9

couples, you are denying not only the protection for the

10

adults, which is independently important, you are

11

denying those protections and that security that would

come from having married parents.
