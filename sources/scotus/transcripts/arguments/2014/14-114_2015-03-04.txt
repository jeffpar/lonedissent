was going to turn 65 in June, which would make her

12

Medicaid­eligible.

MR. CARVIN:

She will turn 65 in late June.

MR. CARVIN:

Fair enough, Your Honor, but ­­

2

but it's black­letter law that only one plaintiff needs

3

standing, and for the reasons I've already articulated,

4

both Plaintiff Hurst and Plaintiff Levy have standing.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.

I don't want to

6

detain you on this any more but I will ask the

7

government what their position is on standing.

8

MR. CARVIN:

9

Returning to the merits, the only provision

10

in the Act which either authorizes or limits subsidies

11

says, in plain English, that the subsidies are only

12

available through an exchange established by the State

13

under Section 1311.

14

Thank you.

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you're going to

15

elaborate on that, I would appreciate your ­­ in your

16

elaboration, I've read that, and this statute is like

17

the tax code more than it's like the Constitution.

18

There are defined terms, and the words you just used

19

concern a defined term.

20

As I read the definition, there's a section,

21

Definitions, and it says, quote, The term "Exchange"

22

means, quote, an exchange established under 1311.

23

1311 says, An Exchange shall be a government agency,

24

et cetera, that is established by a State.

25

the definitions.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Those are

Official

8
1

So then you look to 1321.

And 1321 says, if

2

a State does not set up that Exchange, then the Federal,

3

quote, secretary shall establish and operate such

4

Exchange.

5

So it says, "The Secretary is to establish

6

and operate such Exchange," the only kind of Exchange to

7

which the Act refers, which is an ­­ quote, "an Exchange

8

established by a State under 1311."

9

definition.

10
11

So the statute tells the Secretary, set up
such Exchange, namely, a 1311 State Exchange.

12

MR. CARVIN:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Correct.
And there's nothing else in

this statute.

15

MR. CARVIN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.

17

they're talking about.

18

MR. CARVIN:

19

That's the

So that's throughout what
So what's the problem?
As Your Honor just said, it

tells the Secretary to establish such Exchange.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. CARVIN:

Yes.
And what 36B turns on is

22

whether the State or the Secretary has established the

23

Exchange.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it uses the same

terminology that it's used in ­­ 15 times in this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

statute, namely, the terminology in the definition is

2

"an Exchange established by a State."

3

MR. CARVIN:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. CARVIN:

Under ­­
That's the phrase.
Well, under 1311, that is the

6

phrase.

7

section created some ambiguity as to whether HHS was

8

establishing a 1311 or 1321 Exchange, that is immaterial

9

because 36B does not say all 1311 Exchanges get

And if 1311 created some ­­ the definitional

10

Section 1311 ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

­­ so it eliminates any

potential ambiguity created by the definitional section.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can ­­ can I offer you a

19

sort of simple daily life kind of example which I think

20

is linguistically equivalent to what the sections here

21

say that Justice Breyer was talking about?

22

So I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin.

Their

23

names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda.

24

first clerk, I say, Will, I'd like you to write me a

25

memo.

Okay?

So my

Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write

3

And then I say, Amanda, listen, if

Now, my question is:

If Will is too busy to

5

write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should

6

Elizabeth edit the memo?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. CARVIN:

9

If you're going to create

moneys to Will for writing the memo and Amanda writes

10

the memo and you say, the money will go if Will writes

11

the memo, then under plain English and common sense, no,

MR. CARVIN:

And ­­ and in your chambers,

you're agnostic as to whether Will, Elizabeth or Amanda

4

writes it.

5

1311, Congress was not agnostic as to whether States or

6

HHS established the Exchange.

7

10

But the key point is here under Section

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's ­­

Well, Mr. Carvin, if I had

those clerks, I had the same clerks ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

­­ and Amanda wrote the

11

memo, and I received it and I said, This is a great

12

memo, who wrote it?

13

by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will's shoes?

14

MR. CARVIN:

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. CARVIN:

Would the answer be it was written

That was my first answer.

He's good, Justice Alito.
Justice Kagan didn't accept it,

18

so I'm going to the second answer, which is you are

19

agnostic as between Will and Amanda, but this ­­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

MR. CARVIN:

22
23

Ah, but that's ­­
But Congress was not agnostic

as between State and Federal Exchanges.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

That's a very

24

important point, I think, because what you're saying is

25

that the answer to the question really does depend on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

context, and it depends on an understanding of the law

2

as a whole and whether they were agnostic.

3

that.

4

I agree with

So it's not the simple four or five words

5

because the four or five words in my example, it's

6

obvious that Elizabeth should edit the memo.

7

whole structure and context of the provision that

8

suggests whether those instructions carry over to the

9

substitute, isn't it?

10

MR. CARVIN:

It's the

We implore you to examine these

11

words in the context of the Act as a whole because our

12

argument becomes stronger for five reasons.

13

To respond to Justice Breyer's point, he

14

says such Exchange connotes that it's the same person

15

doing it.

But look at the provision on territorial

16

Exchanges.

It says, territories can establish such

17

Exchanges and then it says, "and shall be treated as a

18

State."

19

So ­­ so ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, it does.

But you say

connote.

a question of denotation.

22

means that the Federal government, the Secretary, is

establishing a thing for the State.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm ­­ I'm a little

15

concerned with how you envision this provision working.

16

You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the

17

State so that it's established by the choice of the

18

State.

19

The choice the State had was establish your

20

own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it

21

for you.

22

you're saying, then we're going to read a statute as

23

intruding on the Federal­State relationship, because

24

then the States are going to be coerced into

25

establishing their own Exchanges.

That was the choice.

If we read it the way

And you say, oh, no,

In those States that don't ­­ their citizens

spiral that this system was created to avoid.

It says in the strongest possible terms we want States

Okay.

Well, if you're going to ruin

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

I mean, let's go back

8

to this question of where ­­ where Congress put this

9

thing because putting aside constitutional issues, I

10

mean, there's at least a presumption, as we interpret

11

statutes, that Congress does not mean to impose heavy

12

burdens and Draconian choices on States unless it says

13

so awfully clearly.

14

And here ­­ and this goes back to what

15

Justice Ginsburg was saying ­­ there's really nothing

16

clear about this.

17

for anybody to even notice this language.

18

I mean, this took a year and a half

And as Justice Ginsburg said, it's ­­ it's

19

put in not in the place that you would expect it to be

20

put in, which is where it says to the ­­ the States,

21

here is the choice you have.

22

the statute defines who a qualified individual is or who

23

is entitled to get the subsidies.

24

in this technical formula that's directed to the

25

Department of the Treasury saying how much the amount of

It's not even put in where

Alderson Reporting Company

the subsidy should be.
And that seems to be ­­ it both makes no

3

sense from Congress's point of view, and in terms of our

4

own point of view, in terms of interpreting statutes,

5

that's not the clarity with which we require the

6

government to speak when it's upsetting Federal­State

7

relations like this.

8
9

MR. CARVIN:

I must respectfully disagree

for three reasons, Justice Kagan.

In the first place,

10

of course, you ­­ where else would you expect a tax

11

credit except in the tax code?

12

You wouldn't put it in 42 U.S.C., which has nothing to

13

do with taxes.

14

limitations placed.

15

It's the only place where Exchange is

You have three audiences here, not just

16

States.

17

entitled to.

18

these subsidies are available.

19

you have to put it in 36B.

20

That's where this was.

You have to tell taxpayers what they're
You have to tell insurance companies when
And you have States.

So

So the argument, I guess, the government is

21

making is what you should have done is put half of it in

22

36B and half it in 1321 which, of course, would have

23

confused everybody.

24

Then you'd go to 1321 and say, when we said Exchanges in

25

36B, we meant established by the State.

36B would say, Exchanges, period.

Mr. Carvin.

15

statute that talks about my choices.

16

I mean, I think the place I would look to

I think the last place I would look is a

17

provision of the statute that talks about ­­ what is

it ­­ coverage months for purposes of this subsection,

19

MR. CARVIN:

this bizarre tax credit provision which is only half

Because then you would create

true, and you wouldn't tell taxpayers and insurance

3

So I believe that's the complete answer.

But the other practical point I'd like to

4

make is they had three years to implement this.

5

one thought the States were going to have to make a

6

decision overnight.

7

State would have been fully informed of the consequences

because presumably they've read 36B, and then they would

of which supports their argument that you have to read

Now, that's their basic point.

to summarize it.

MR. CARVIN:

There are no ­­ the first point

individuals point about how there would be nobody on HHS

up here and tell you that if we prevail in our

interpretation of 36B, they would be obliged by the

all agree that there's no connection between 36B and the

The government agrees with

Their biggest anomaly is this qualified

The Solicitor General is not going to stand

Point two is, if you want anomalies, their

So we

32

interpretation of the statute requires 34 States today

2

to lose all Medicaid coverage.

3

the provisions on 64a through 66a of the government's

4

brief, there are various requirements that the State, on

5

pain of losing all of its Medicaid funds, must

6

coordinate between the State­established Exchange, the

7

State agency for CHIP, and the State agency for Medicaid

8

in terms of secure interface and enrollment.

9

Why is that?

Because of

Now that makes perfect sense if "Exchange

10

established by the State" means what it says, but they

11

think it encompasses HHS Exchanges.

12

cannot ensure coordination between HHS Exchanges and the

13

State agencies, and none of the 34 are doing it today.

14

So under their atextual reading of the statute, 34

15

States will suffer the penalty that this Court found in

16

NFIB as unconstitutionally coercive.

17

Well, the State

As to this Medicaid maintenance anomaly, the

18

government agrees that the purpose of this provision was

19

to freeze Medicaid payments until you had an Exchange

coordinate the two.

22

And that's exactly what this provision means

23

under our interpretation.

24

with subsidies, the States will be frozen.

You want to

5

So there was a 3­year freeze on Medicaid that they were

6

powerless to get out of.

7

That's a figment of their imagination.

Before 2014, the States were powerless to have
They couldn't do it.

After 2014, if they don't want to have their

Medicaid frozen, all they have to do is establish an

Exchange.

So it's a less harsh restriction on States,

10

plus which it gives them another incentive in addition

11

to the subsidies to create the State Exchange, which is

12

the purpose enunciated in 1311.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6
7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

Standing has been raised, so let me start by
telling you where we stand on

standing and then I'd

10

appreciate the opportunity after that to summarize what

11

I think are the two key points in this case.

12

Now, with respect to standing, the question

13

­­ the case or controversy question turns on whether any

14

of the four Petitioners is liable for the tax penalty

15

for 2014.

16

Now, this case was litigated in ­­ in the

17

district court in 2013 based on projections on the part

18

of each of the four Petitioners that they would earn a

19

certain income in 2014.

20

that.

21

­­ of their income were such that they would qualify for

22

the unaffordability exception and they wouldn't have

23

standing.

24

projections were such that they wouldn't qualify for the

25

unaffordability exception and they would have standing.

They filed declarations saying

With respect to 2 of the 4, the projections were

With respect to the other 2, their

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

But those were projections in 2013 about their income in

2

2014.

3

don't know, but Petitioners know whether any of the 4

4

have, in fact ­­ are, in fact, liable for the tax

5

penalty and that will depend on whether their ­­ their

6

actual income in 2014 matched their projections.

7

2014 has now come and gone, and we know ­­ we

Now, Mr. Carvin said there was factfinding

8

about this.

9

Petitioners ­­ the Petitioners did file a motion for

I'm afraid that's not correct.

The ­­ the

10

summary judgment, but the case was decided on the basis

11

of the government's motion to dismiss before discovery

12

and without any factfinding.

13

I'm assuming because Mr. Carvin has not said

14

anything about the absence of a tax penalty, that, at

15

least, 1 of the 4 has and is, in fact, liable for a tax

16

penalty, but that's the key standing question.

17

Now, with respect to the veterans point,

18

Your Honor, if it is the case, as Mr. Carvin tells us,

19

that Mr. Hurst was a veteran for only 10 months, then I

20

think he's correct, he would not qualify for VA health

21

care because you generally have to serve two years.

22

that's where we are on standing.

23

Now, if I could turn to the merits.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

So are you saying one

person does have standing?

Alderson Reporting Company

So

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, no.

It will depend

2

on whether as a factual matter 1 of the 4 has and is, in

3

fact, liable for the tax penalty for 2014.

4

information that is not in the government's possession;

5

it is in the possession of Petitioners' counsel.

6

should make one more point, with respect to 2015, there

7

were no projections, there's nothing in the record about

8

the possible income of any of the Petitioners for 2015,

9

so there's really nothing that would establish a case of

10
11

And that's

controversy for 2014.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you're surely

12

not raising a standing question with us here for the

13

first time at oral argument, are you?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

15

as I said, that based on the projections, it is our ­­

be liable for a tax penalty.

has been raised and I've tried to identify for the Court

what I think is the relevant question, which is whether

any one of the 4 has, in fact ­­ is, in fact, liable for

21

a tax penalty because ­­

2

the case or controversy.

4

there's no ­­ there's no injury.

5

that's ultimately the relevant question here and ­­ with

6

respect to standing.

7

about veteran status, but I do think that's the relevant

8

question.

9

Because if there's no ­­ if none of the 4

I don't think there's a question

10

as to standing whether the district court correctly held

11

in the motion to dismiss context that there was

12

standing?

13

don't we have to ­­ isn't that what's before us?

14

That may not be the end of the matter, but

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, that ­­ that may be

15

­­ yes.

16

think about this as a question of mootness, I guess, in

17

that, you know, based on the projection, there was a

18

case or controversy, but if the projection didn't come

19

to pass and none of the plaintiffs is liable for a tax

20

penalty, then the case or controversy no longer exists.

respect to a hypothetical about airports, and that ­­ a

statute requires a State to construct an airport, it

says the Federal government shall construct such airport

Answer me in principle.

mean, is it not the case that if the only reasonable

disastrous consequences in the rest of the statute, it

19

nonetheless means what it says.

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I

Is that true or not?
I think there are ­­

21

there are a couple of limitations on that principle.

22

The first is if what you have is a situation in which

23

the ­­ that it creates conflict within a statutory scheme,

24

then the Court's got to do its best to try to harmonize

25

and reconcile the provisions.

And secondly ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I disagree with that.

2

You have a single case in which we have said the

3

provision is not ambiguous, it means this thing, but,

4

Lord, that would make a terrible statute, so we will

5

interpret it to mean something else.

6

case where we've ever said that?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Do you have one

I think ­­ I think Brown

8

& Williamson is a good example of that.

9

Williamson, the Court said, look, the definition of drug

In Brown &

10

and drug delivery device would actually seem

11

unambiguously to cover tobacco, but when you read that

12

provision in context, and considering the full scope of

13

the regulatory regime, it can't possibly mean that.

14

But let me ­­ let me actually work through

15

the text here, because I do think I can show you that

16

there's a quite reasonable reading of this statutory

17

text that allows you to affirm and requires you to

18

affirm the government's position.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, General Verrilli,

20

before we get too immersed in a number of provisions of

21

this, could you respond to a question that was asked

22

during Mr. Carvin's argument.

23

interpretation of this Act, is it unconstitutionally

24

coercive?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

If we adopt Petitioners'

7

First, you've got

Now, with respect to the other 8 States that

8

filed the amicus brief on the other side, I actually

9

think there's quite an important point that goes to

10

their understanding of what this Act did.

11

this is an IRS rule that we're talking about here, and

12

the IRS put out a notice of proposed rulemaking saying

13

this is what we intend to do, and several of these

14

States ­­ Oklahoma, Indiana, Nebraska ­­ they filed

15

rulemaking comments in that ­­ in that proceeding.

16

if you look at those rulemaking comments you will see

17

that they address a number of issues, and they say

18

nothing, nothing about the ­­ the issue that's before

19

the Court now.

Remember,

And

20

So if they really understood the statute as

21

denying subsidies in States that did not set up their

22

own exchanges, that would have front and center in their

23

rulemaking comments, but they said nothing about it and

24

such as the Northern Pipeline case.

8

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Sure.

Northern Pipeline

is an example of doing that, and it will be up to the

10

Court to decide whether it has the authority to do that.

11

I will say, this does seem different than Northern

12

Pipeline to me, because this is about money going out of

13

the Federal treasury, which is a different scenario.

14

But if the Court ­­ obviously, if that's where the Court

15

is going and that's what the Court thinks the proper

16

disposition is, that would reduce the disruption.

17

But what I think is another important point

18

to make here just as a practical matter, the idea that a

19

number of States, all of these States or a significant

20

number are going to be able to in the 6 months between

21

when a decision in the this case would come out and when

22

the new ­­ the new year for insurance purposes will

23

begin we'll be able to set up Exchanges, get them up, up

24

and running and get all the approvals done I think is

completely unrealistic.

3

this Congress would act.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And ­­ but the relevant

5

question ­­ and then I'm going to try to get back to

6

the point I was trying to make in response to Justice

7

Alito's question.

8
9

The relevant question here is:

What did the

Congress that enacted this statute in 2010 do?

Did they

10

really set up a system in which the States are subject

11

to the kind of onerous situation that the Petitioner

12

claims?

13

indications ­­ objective, textual indications that that

14

cannot possibly have been the statutory scheme that

15

Congress tried to set up.

16

And I think there are three textual

First is the existence of the Federal

17

Exchanges.

18

Congress to have provided for Federal Exchanges if,

19

as ­­ as Mr. Carvin suggests, the statutory design was

20

supposed to result in every State establishing its

21

Exchange.

It would make no sense, no sense for

22

Second ­­

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, wouldn't it have

24

been ­­ again, talking about Federalism ­­ a mechanism

25

for States to show that they had concerns about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

wisdom and the workability of the Act in the form that

2

it was passed?

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, Justice Kennedy, I

4

think the Federalism values are promoted by our

5

interpretation, because if ­­ if that is, indeed, what a

6

State thought, if a State really would have preferred

7

that ­­ not to have the State government participate in

8

the implementation of this Act, for reasons that Your

9

Honor identified, the structure of the Act that Congress

10

put in place and that we're advocating for today fully

11

vindicates that concern.

12

participate without having any adverse consequences

13

visited upon the citizens of the State.

14

They can decide not to

And that's why our reading is the

15

pro­Federalism reading.

16

to me that is the anti­Federalism reading, and that's a

17

powerful reason to reject it.

It's their reading that seems

18

And if I could go to the second statutory

19

point, which is related to what we're talking about,

20

Justice Kennedy, which is Section 1321, says that this

21

statute is designed to afford State flexibility.

22

flexibility.

23

"flexibility" to use it in the manner that Petitioners

24

say the statute uses it, because it's the polar opposite

25

of flexibility.

State

It would be an Orwellian sense of the word

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

And the third point, seems to me, is the

2

notice point, that if, indeed, the plan was, as Mr.

3

Carvin said, that every State was going to establish an

4

Exchange for itself and that that would cure all of the

5

massive statutory anomalies and textual anomalies and

6

absurdities and impossibilities that his reading

7

provides for, if that was really the plan, then the

8

consequence for the States would be in neon lights in

9

this statute.

10
11

You would want to make absolutely sure

that every State got the message.
But instead what you have is a subclause in

12

Section 36B, which is a provision that addresses the

13

eligibility of individual taxpayers for taxing purposes.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is not the most

15

elegantly drafted statute.

It was ­­ it was pushed

16

through on expedited procedures and didn't have the kind

17

of consideration by a conference committee, for example,

18

that ­­ that statutes usually do.

19

What ­­ what would be so surprising if ­­

20

if, among its other imperfections, there is the

21

imperfection that what the States have to do is not ­­

22

is not obvious enough?

23

inconceivable.

24
25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It doesn't strike me as

So, Justice Scalia, I ­­

I'm going to answer that question by talking about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

legislative process, because I think it is quite

2

relevant and I think it ought to be quite relevant even

3

to you with respect to the question you just asked.

4

The language here in 36B was not the product

5

of some last­minute deal, it wasn't the product of

6

scrambling at the end.

7

the statutory structure with the language of 36B about

8

tax credits, the language that's in 1311, the language

9

that's in 1321 was the product of the Senate Finance

10

Committee markup, which went on for weeks and weeks.

11

The language that emerged here,

It was a public ­­ it was a public hearing.

12

It ­­ frankly, it was covered by C­SPAN.

13

watch it on the C­SPAN archives if you want to; and you

14

will see coming out of that that the ­­ that the

15

understanding, the clear understanding was with this

16

statutory setup would result in subsidies being

17

available in every State.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can go

the statutory language before the Court now.

4

Not a single one has anything to do with

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the puzzle that's

5

created by ­­ by your interpretation is this:

6

Congress did not want the phrase "established by the

7

State" to mean what that would normally be taken to

8

mean, why did they use that language?

9

use other formulations that appear elsewhere in the Act?

If

Why didn't they

10

Why didn't they say, "established under the Act"?

11

didn't they say, "established within the State"?

12

didn't they include a provision saying that an Exchange

13

established by HHS is a State Exchange when they have a

14

provision in there that does exactly that for the

15

District of Columbia and for the territories?

16

that they are deemed to be States for purposes of this

17

Act.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Why
Why

It says

So ­­
So why would they do that?
So, of course, the

21

provision says ­­ doesn't say "established by the State"

22

with a period after State.

It says "established by the

23

State under Section 1311."

And our position textually

24

is ­­ and we think this is clearly the better reading of

25

the text ­­ that by cross­referencing Section 1311,

Alderson Reporting Company

effectively what Congress is doing is saying that

So you're saying that

7

that's true.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

Well, let me ­­ and

I do think that, and let me walk through why I think

13

17

Yes.

No, I think ­­
­­ for your case ­­

­­ not the

right direction.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, I think it goes in

19

the right direction, if you'll just ride with me for a

20

little bit, Justice Kennedy, on this.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before you ­­ before

22

you get on to that, that ­­ your answer doesn't explain

23

why ­­ why "by the State" is in there.

24

they say "established under 1311"?

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Then why didn't

Well, so the second point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

is that wherever this provision appears in the Act,

2

"established by the State under Section 1311," it's

3

doing work; and the work it's doing is saying, what

4

we're talking about is the specific Exchange established

in the specific State as opposed to general rules for

Why didn't they say "in the State"?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Because ­­ I suppose they

13

could have, but it worked perfectly well this way.

14

you look at the qualified individual provision, it's

15

clearly how they're using it with respect to the

16

qualified individual provision.

17

that provision, it says a qualified individual is a

18

person who is located ­­ who resides in the State that

19

established the Exchange.

20

about is a geographical reference to the particular

21

State.

22

every time the ­­ the statute uses that phrase.

23

24

But now if I could go back to your point,

25

Justice Kennedy, it says, "established by the State

Section 1311(b)(1) says, "Each

6

Now, we know that when Congress used that

7

language, "each State shall establish," it must have

8

meant something more inclusive than each State

9

government shall itself set up the Exchange.

10

We know that because Congress is legislating

11

against the backdrop of the Tenth Amendment, and so it

12

couldn't impose that requirement.

13

because of Section 1321, because Section 1321 provides

14

the means by which the 1311(b)(1) requirement is

meet the Federal requirements for Exchanges, or it can

And we know that

It will be satisfied by a State electing to

JUSTICE ALITO:

So when the statute says,

21

"each State shall establish," it really means the

22

Federal government shall establish if a State doesn't

23

establish.

24

GENERAL VERRILLI:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the right way ­­
And if that were the correct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

64
1
2

interpretation, you wouldn't 1321 at all.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

So ­­ no.

I think the

3

right way to think about this, Justice Alito, is that

4

what's going on here is that ­­ the right place to

5

focus, let me put it that way.

6

here is not on the who, but on the what; on the thing

7

that gets set up and whether it qualifies as an Exchange

8

established by the State, and these Exchanges do

9

qualify.

10

The right place to focus

And the reason they qualify is because they

11

fulfill the requirement in Section 1311(b)(1) that each

12

State shall establish an Exchange.

13

that because it says to the HHS that when a ­­ when a

14

State hasn't elected to meet the Federal requirements,

15

HHS steps in, and what the HHS does is set up the

16

required Exchange.

17

referring to the ­­ immediately prior to the required

18

Exchange where the only Exchange required in the Act is

19

an Exchange under Section 1311(b)(1).

20

And 1321 tells you

It says such Exchange, which is

So it has to be that that's ­­ that what HHS

21

is doing under the plain text of the statute is

22

fulfilling the requirement of the Section 1311(b)(1)

23

that each State establish an Exchange, and for that

24

reason we say it qualifies as an Exchange established by

25

the State.

That's reinforced, as Justice Breyer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

65
1

suggested earlier, by the definition which says that an

2

Exchange is an Exchange established under Section 1311.

3

1311, again, has 1311(b)(1) which says each State shall

4

establish an Exchange.

5

And it has to be that way because

6

Petitioners have conceded, and it's at page 22 of their

7

brief, that an Exchange that HHS sets up is supposed to

8

be the same Exchange that Petitioners say function just

9

like an Exchange that the State sets up for itself.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you're ­­ you're

11

putting a lot of weight on the ­­ on the ­­ one word,

12

13

unrealistic interpretation of "such" to mean the Federal

14

7

does.

reasonable reading of the statute.

It is really the

10

only reading of the statute that allows you to be

9

point.

The statute says each State shall.

It doesn't

say States that have set up Exchanges for themselves

what's the provision you were referring to when you said

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I ­­ what they ­­

20

what the statute says throughout is that ­­ that

21

qualified individuals are eligible to purchase on

22

Exchanges, and it's the necessary meaning of that phrase

23

that if you are not a qualified individual, then you are

24

not eligible to purchase health care on an Exchange

25

because otherwise, the word qualified would not have any

of provisions that only a qualified individual may

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's ­­ well, that's what

doesn't make any sense to say that prisoners should be

16

specific statutory provision that says when you face a

that's not ­­ that's not surplus, that's there for a

little odd that the director of Internal Revenue

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So a few points about

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

if you're right about Chevron, that would indicate that

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think a subsequent

administration would need a very strong case under step

18

two of the Chevron analysis that that was a reasonable

19

judgment in view of the disruptive consequences.

20

I said, I think you can resolve and should resolve this

The dispute here is whether or

not if they win under ambiguity, and they don't because

the canon requires unambiguous statutes not to afford

the tax credit.

think that's very helpful in terms of Justice Kennedy's

concern about Federalism.

In terms of the employer mandate, I

Under their view of the

theirs.

Your Honor, I think my short answer is as follows:

22

There's no way to view this statute as more coercive or

23

harmful than the Medicaid ­­ version of Medicaid that

24

was approved by this Court in NFIB and, indeed, the NFIB

25

alternative reading of the statute that ­­ that avoids

sovereignty.

out the HHS Exchanges.

13

argument that with respect to an Exchange under the

tendentious litigation position and not a serious
