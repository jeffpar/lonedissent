ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
My clients filed this lawsuit against

12

Mr. Waxman's clients.

13

lawsuit and said that it was terminated.

14

The district court dismissed that

Now, from the earliest days of this Court's

15

­­ excuse me, this nation's jurisdictional statutes,

16

that would be an appealable order under the aptly named

17

Final Judgment Rule, and that must be so unless

18

something changed with Congress's enactment of Section

19

1407(a) of the multidistrict litigation statute.

20

ask you to hold that nothing changed, and it was

21

appealable for three reasons.

And we

24

complaint, our own docket, our own lawyers, our own

25

plaintiffs, and our own defendants.

It was dismissed.

We had our own

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

The second is that there is no judgment in

2

the MDL itself, so there is nothing from which we could

3

appeal at the end of the MDL litigation, so it must be

4

that we appeal from this.

5

And the third is that Rule 54(b) of the

6

Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply because that

7

applies to the dismissal of part of an action, some of

8

the claims or some of the parties, not the whole action.

9

And here, the whole action was dismissed.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me,

11

first, what difference there is, if any, pursuant to

12

your reasons, that would not apply to a consolidated

13

case for all purposes, number one?

14

isn't a case consolidated with others, for purposes of

15

pretrial proceedings, a pending action that involves

16

multiple parties?

consolidated for all purposes.

11

Your rule basically is saying consolidation

13

now will permit piecemeal appeals in almost every

14

circumstance, except for a very limited number.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There may be a case

One preliminary point and

16

then the question about what our rule produces.

17

In MDL litigation, as this district court

18

recognized, you actually don't have consolidation for

19

all purposes.

20

can be consolidation for pretrial purposes only.

pretrial purposes in this case are over.

23

Section 1407(a) specifies is that there
The

The complaint

Now, as to the policy arguments of the

24

Respondents, that there is a grave concern that our rule

25

would produce interlocutory appeals that go up to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

court of appeals, lots of different times, there is a

2

straightforward answer to that point, and that is that

3

district courts, just as they have the discretion to

4

enter a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b), have

5

the same discretion to avoid entering a final judgment

6

in individual actions under Rule 58(b).

7

And this is very common in MDL litigation,

8

just as you indicate, Justice Sotomayor.

9

frequently district courts will enter consolidated

Very

10

complaints and will not enter orders in the individual

11

actions that would be appealable.

12

The distinct feature of this case, the

13

critical distinct feature here is that this district

14

court decided to dismiss in its entirety our individual

15

actions.

15

do say that.

Mr. Justice Breyer, is actually not that our ­­ our

result will produce a mess.

22

say, we're not asking you to ­­ we're not saying what

23

the correct interpretation of the statute or rules are.

don't want automatic interlocutory appeals from MDLs.

It is ­­ they quite clearly

Alderson Reporting Company

automatic interlocutory appeals because district judges

3

are perfectly free, through a number of tools, only one

4

of which we've been discussing, not to enter.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then you say to the clerk, Clerk, don't

10

enter the piece of paper called the judgment because I

don't want them to take an appeal.

13

that must be an abusive discretion.

has it happened a lot?

Now, they can do it under 54

or they can enter a final judgment in the case.

11

there is the 1935 MDL using Rule 58(b), but there are

12

many other tools the district judges have.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein, as ­­ as

14

your view of the case is 54(b) would not be

Justice

Breyer's suggestion of Rule 54(b) would not work if the

It ­­ it seems to me that if you're asking for these

sort of furtive measures, we might as well face up to

the problem right away and just adopt Mr. Waxman's

position.

don't think it's ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me you're

asking the judge to be almost disingenuous.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, we disagree for the

21

following reason, and that is, if the point of

22

Mr. Waxman's side is that district judges need

23

discretion to decide when to enter judgments, whether

24

they're 54(b), partial final judgments, or final

25

judgments under Rule 58, the discretion should be the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13

2

same.
And the tools that I'm talking about are not

3

used disingenuously by your district judges.

4

used consistently, and that is ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They are

Are you then saying that

6

there's no practical difference between your position

7

and Mr. Waxman's position?

8

saying Rule 54 is not the right vehicle.

In other words, you're

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's an important

11

point.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's important to get the

14

rules right, whether it's Rule 54 or something else.

15

But are you saying that there is no practical difference

16

between the two?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'm saying there's little

18

practical difference.

19

their side requires the district court and the court of

20

appeals to have litigation on whether Rule 54(b)

21

certification is appropriate, and whether the district

22

court abused its discretion in entering a Rule 54(b)

23

judgment.

24
25

There is some, and that is that

But there isn't much beyond that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
difference.

There's one huge

The district judge can say no to 54(b) if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

it's a final judgment.

2

that's exactly what the judge said.

3

he said, you have an appeal of right, and ­­ she said to

4

the plaintiff who was dismissed.

5
6

In this ­­ in this very case,
In the first round,

And then when the Second Circuit said no,
she refused to give a 54(b).

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The reason it's not a huge

8

difference, Justice Ginsburg, is that the district court

9

doesn't have to enter a final judgment.

10

I'll give you a very specific example.

The

11

district court in this case entered a ruling in three

12

different cases, the OTC plaintiff's case, the exchange

13

plaintiff's case, and the ­­ our clients, the bondholder

14

case.

15

opinion in the OTC or exchange complaints in the

16

complaint that had just an antitrust claim, for example,

17

that did not have just an antitrust claim, then there

18

would not be an appealable final judgment.

19

The district court quite consciously

And if the district court had instead entered her

20

resolved all the antitrust issues, knowing that they

21

would go up on appeal.

22

after the Second Circuit, in a rule that the Respondents

23

do not defend, decided that it did not want to hear the

24

appeal as a matter of its discretion.

25

She just changed her mind only

It is quite important, I think, that ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't think this court

2

of appeals said as a matter of its discretion, and that

3

was one thing that puzzled me about your presentation.

4

The court of appeals said we have no jurisdiction.

5

That's quite different from saying we have discretion.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Ah.

But, Justice Ginsburg,

7

their rule is a case­by­case determination if they do

have jurisdiction.

And they said, in our ­­ they did it

The defendants did not move actually to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The court of appeals, applying this

jurisdiction.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right, they did.

But their

18

rule is that sometimes you can have an ­­ an appeal like

this, and they will deem it to be an appealable final

20

judgment.

But we do think it is important to recognize

10

that there is a real reason for the appeals to go

forward and that is, that it avoids duplicative

discovery when we have to come back after appeal and

there is the very real prospect of multiple appeals in

that is, to the extent that members of the Court are

concerned, that the district courts are concerned, the

9

district judges that you cite, Justice Breyer, that we

And,

10

shouldn't have these interlocutory appeals, then the

11

district courts have the tools to deal with that ­­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but what they tell

13

us, these judges, who are experienced, I stress, on

14

pages 12 and 13, "District courts have evaluated the

15

Third Circuit factors," that is 54(b) factors, "in

16

deciding whether to certify one among several

17

consolidated cases for appeal."

18

the footnote they have several cases which I take it,

19

since they tell us that, are cases where they were

20

consolidated cases, they used 54(b) to say that one of

21

the cases could go ahead on appeal.

22

Footnote, and then in

Now, I took that as saying that judges are

23

using 54(b) to accomplish the end that we seem

My point is that to the extent

It is not

The argument for our position that I have

there is no such order or judgment.

5

I can appeal from is the dismissal of my action.

6

not know, at the end of the MDL, what it is that I'm

7

actually appealing from.

8

that they have is that Rule 54(b) doesn't apply here

9

because the entire act ­­ you're going to have to change

The only thing that
I do

They have ­­ the other problem

10

the meaning of what an action is throughout the ­­ all

11

of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which is uniformly the

12

single piece of litigation, the single complaint, and

13

there is no reason to create confusion.

14

Imagine after the ruling that Mr. Waxman

15

wants, there are four cases in the district court, and

16

they relate to the same sort of facts, and the district

17

court dismisses one.

18

about what an action is, then people are going to be

19

unclear about when it is that they should be appealing.

20

Because our lawsuit is a separate one; it is in a

If you introduce this ambiguity

suggest that the Court look at the docket, for example,

in the Fontainebleau MDL, which is I think number 2106.

11

proceedings, imagine the district court dismisses

are voluntarily dismissed.

MR. WAXMAN:

When our case

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Let me start with what's now been the

16

accepted terminology of the disingenuous approach to

17

achieving the flexibility of the district court's need

18

and to avoid the obligation that the courts of appeals

19

must ­­ because his rule requires immediate seriatim

21

the ­­ a form of guerilla judging, but the point is that

22

the flexibility that both sides agree and the retired

district judges certainly underscore that district

24

courts need and the relief that the courts of appeals

25

need from the obligation to hear seriatim piecemeal

I have been calling it

appeals, is achieved by application of the rule that was

2

specifically designed for this, which is Rule 54(b).

3

Now, he says 54(b) doesn't apply.

What that

4

means is ­­ let me just first start by saying, in this

5

entire litigation, one and only one authority has been

6

cited for that proposition.

The text of 54(b) refers to

a separate appeal for a claim, counterclaim,

13

Mr. Goldstein's complaint became part of a single

action.

The only document

she said.

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, what she said in

adjudicating the request by other parties for a 54(b)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

certification, this is on Page 220 of the petition

2

appendix is that these plaintiffs and the Schwab

3

plaintiffs have an appeal of right, there is no question

4

that she misapprehended the rule in the Second Circuit

5

that just because she had dismissed all of the claims in

6

their suit they have an appeal of right.

7

that she entered a judgment ­­

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the notion

She thought that she

9

needed to the to do the 54(b) for the other cases that

10

had more than one claim, not just the antitrust claim.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Correct, and let me say

12

something about their subsequent motion under ­­ the

13

Gelboim subsequent motion under 54(b) after the

14

dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by the court of

15

appeals, but first point out to you that the order that

16

she's referring to, 43, which says that the case is

17

terminated pursuant to instructions from chambers, you

18

know, I wondered, well, why isn't there anything in the

19

docket that in fact terminates it, and the answer is on

20

page ­­ pages 15 through 19 of the joint appendix where,

21

as you can see on Page 19, she has reissued the same

22

memorandum and order as modified, three days later.

23

And the language that they like to cite for

24

the notion that there was a judgment in their case is

25

missing.

And that's why they, in fact, continue to be a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then you're just ­­

3

let's go back to my question.

4

always learned like Hornbook rule number 1 is, there is

5

a separate piece of paper called a judgment entered by

6

the district court, and that is what you appeal from.

7

Now you have just told me, there isn't one here, in

8

which case he can't appeal, okay, that's a separate

9

reason.

I agree with you, I'd

I'm now assuming another case.

The case is,

10

there is a separate piece of paper in his case called a

11

judgment.

12

called a judgment to appeal from, it was entered at a

13

certain time and now I know when the clock starts.

His point is, that gives me a piece of paper

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right, yes.
Now, what I said

was,

16

some time ago, that I thought he had a point, is in such

17

a case, if we treat the consolidation of

18

proceedings like we treat a consolidation of cases

19

without the multidistrict, he cannot appeal from that

20

piece of paper.

21

situation, not multidistrict, until there is another

22

piece of paper resolving everything, then he starts to

23

appeal but at least he has a piece of paper which maybe

24

he lacked here.

25

The same piece of paper that he

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a red herring at the

moment.
MR. WAXMAN: Well okay but, et me at least finish my
sentence.
At the end, when the district judge

11

certifies that the consolidation period is over, whether

12

that's, you know, at the end of discovery or at the end

13

of pretrial proceedings or in a case under rule 42 at

14

the end of the trial of the case, or a case, the parties

15

will seek to the extent the court has not entered it,

16

under rule 58 a separate piece of paper that says either

17

judgment or that's the functional equivalent of judgment

18

under rule, under rule 54(A), which says a judgment is

19

an appealable order.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Waxman, have you made

21

this argument before, did you make this argument in

22

opposition to the petition for certiorari, namely that

23

there was no final judgment here.

We did, and it got discouraged

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, the Second

Circuit didn't think that there was a problem because

5

the ­­ a judgment hadn't been entered.

6

of these cases when a consolidated or pretrial, there is

7

no right of appeal, you have to get permission under

8

rule 54(b).

9

in this case is that there was no judgment document.

They said in all

They did not say anything about the problem

10

And isn't there, I know that there ­­ there is a

11

provision that says, if the judgment ­­ if for some

12

reason you don't have the piece of paper, that's not

13

fatal.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, I

15

respectfully suggest that you're mistaken in reading

16

what the Second Circuit said.

17

petitioner appendix and what it says is, this court has

18

determined sua sponte that it lacks jurisdiction over

19

these appeals because a final order has not been issued

20

by the district court as contemplated by section 1291,

21

comma, and the orders of ­­ the orders appealed from did

22

not dispose of all the claims in the consolidated

action.

judgments during the period of consolidation when the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, 1292(b) can't be

applicable here.

19

MR. WAXMAN:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, it's not.
1292(b) is when you don't

21

have a final judgment.

22

the typical case for 1292(b) is the court decides

23

liability, but it hasn't decided damages yet.

24

run upstairs at that point unless you get a 1292(b)

order.

It's an interlocutory appeal,

MR. WAXMAN:

You are absolutely right, and I

stand corrected.

3

when there are multi claim, multiparty proceedings,

4

either because they are different cases that are

5

consolidated for a period of consolidation or a single

6

omnibus complaint which could have happened in this

7

case, a ruling as to all the claims of a particular

8

party or all of the parties as to a particular claim

9

becomes a judgment when and only when the district court

11

My point is that during the period,

certifies a judgment under 54(b).
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that's quite

12

different.

thought, that the Second Circuit said that there had

14

been no final judgment in this case.

consolidated cases but no final judgment in this case.

actually happened here, but I think in thinking about

the meaning of "final decision" under 1291, which

doesn't use the word "action" what a final decision is,

9

with an eye toward what is a healthy legal system, this

10

case, I think ­­ I think it's important to focus on just

11

the features of this case as one of many, many examples

12

why the rule that they're advocating is not correct.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

You raised the argument

14

before us this morning that there wasn't a final

15

judgment and Petitioner argues that there was under Rule

16

58(c)(2)(b) and you didn't address that, I believe, in

17

your brief.

So what is wrong with that argument?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

Well, the 58(c)(2)(b) is 150 days from the,

20

quote, judgment that's reflected in 58(b), and 58(b)(1)

21

in particular says, you know, entering judgment without

22

the court's direction.

23

issues an order otherwise ­­ unless the court orders

24

otherwise, the clerk has to enter a written judgment.

25

But the caveat there, which does apply in

58(c)(2)(b).

And it says that if a court

this case for reasons because this does involve ­­ these

2

consolidated proceedings are an action within the

3

meaning of 54, is that 58(b)(1) is, quote, “subject to

4

54(b).”

5

Now, in terms of ­­ let me just make the

6

point I was trying to make before, which is, look

7

exactly at what the Petitioner is trying to do in this

8

case, just as an example of what a healthy judicial

9

system is.

10

They say that they're entitled to ­­ they're

11

required immediately to appeal and the Second Circuit is

12

obligated immediately to consider their appeal,

13

notwithstanding, among other things, two things in

14

particular; one, even as we are ­­ the Court is

15

considering this case, the district judge is considering

16

claims by the Plaintiffs in seven other consolidated

17

cases that have raised Sherman Act claims that, in fact,

18

her prior ruling on Sherman Act antitrust injury does

19

not apply to them.

20

that issue, will be completed, I believe, on Christmas

21

Eve, and so if an appeal had been proceeding, the Second

22

Circuit would be considering precisely the same thing

23

that the judge is reconsidering, and the cases are

legion in which ­­

that we ­­ notwithstanding your prior ruling in the

11

circumstances of our cases, we do have antitrust injury,

12

and from a point of view of a healthy judicial system,

13

you would want the court of appeals to be able to

consider the question of antitrust injury after the

to all of the consolidated cases.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think what the Chief

Justice is indicating is to the extent that the issues,

19

the claims are the same, the efficiency argument can cut

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the district judge

had been right the first time, she said I have a claim

14

claims, so what I'm going to do is this, final judgment

for the one that has no other claims, 54(b) on the

Circuit will then hear antitrust standing all at once.

MR. WAXMAN:

there are other parties in the consolidated pre ­­

She said that first, as ­­ as far as that's ­­

14

MR. WAXMAN:

By the way,

I think, Justice Ginsburg, that

the point I wanted to make here is she has left fully

open the possibility that when she finishes resolving

17

the pleading problems, including the claims of the other

18

seven Sherman Act plaintiffs who say they're different,

19

she will reconsider whether to grant Rule 54(b).

are all sorts of obscure procedural mechanisms where you

It is what's

known ­­ there's a Sixth Circuit case called Refrigerant

that discusses this issue and a Second Circuit case

called Katz.

23

The district court uses this administrative complaint to

24

manage the litigation, and that administrative complaint

25

doesn't have the same docket as the individual actions.

It is called an administrative complaint.

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm going to resolve the antitrust claim ­­ not an

action, an antitrust claim ­­ inside this larger

administrative complaint without entering a judgment.

5

And when there is no judgment, there's no appeal.

you can announce that rule and give the district courts
