ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Mere possession of a short­barreled shotgun

12

is not a violent felony within the definition of the

13

Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause because it

14

is neither similar in the degree of risk nor similar in

15

kind to the enumerated offenses set forth in the

16

language that immediately precedes that clause.

17

this Court has repeatedly held that those enumerated

18

offenses provide important both qualitative and

19

quantitative parameters to lower courts in examining

20

whether a particular predicate offense counts as a

21

violent felony.

And

22

Just 6 years ago in Begay, this Court made

23

clear that the enumerated offenses must be similar ­­

24

I'm sorry, a question predicate offense must be similar

25

in kind to one of the enumerated offenses as well as

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

similar in degree of risk.

2

framework is applied to the question of mere possession

3

of a short­barreled shotgun, it satisfies neither test.

4

And when that proper

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Should the Court ­­

5

should the Court take into account that in the

6

sentencing guidelines a possession of a short­barreled

7

shotgun is ranked under career, is under the career

8

offenses?

9

MS. MENENDEZ:

Your Honor, in Guideline

10

Amendment 674 in 2004, which Your Honor asks about, the

11

Sentencing Commission included mere possession of an

12

unregistered short­barreled shotgun or possession of a

13

short­barreled shotgun as a crime of violence.

14

did not do so after an examination of the empirical data

15

or an assessment of the pool of data that gives us great

16

confidence in the Sentencing Commission's decisions.

17

In marked contrast, Your Honor, in 1991,

18

when the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 433

19

that concluded that being a felon in possession of a

20

firearm should not count as a crime of violence under

21

the guidelines, it reached that conclusion after an

22

extensive examination of empirical data.

23

between the adoption of those two amendments highlights

24

the reason that the Sentencing Commission's decision on

25

this point does not deserve deference in this case.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

But it

The difference

Official

1

An additional consideration, Your Honor, is

2

that in making that decision in 2004, the Sentencing

3

Commission was not anticipating the guidance that this

4

Court provided in James, Begay, Chambers, and Sykes, and

5

it doesn't engage in any of the proper analysis.

6

whether we look at it as the Sentencing Commission not

7

serving their traditional role as factfinders and the

8

keepers of empirical data or whether we acknowledge the

9

fact that it preceded very important guidance from this

10

Court, I don't think it controls this Court's decision.

Is it ­­
Is it possible ­­
I'm sorry.
Is it possible for any

possession offense to qualify as a violent felony?
MS. MENENDEZ:

Your Honor, I believe it

17

would be possible for a very rare possession offense to

18

qualify as a violent felony if the possession alone

19

presents a serious potential risk of injury.

20

Respectfully, I believe the flaw with the other side's

21

position in this case is their entire analysis is based

22

not on the risk inherent in the mere possession, but on

23

the risk inherent in committing a further violent crime

24

with that weapon.

25

possession of a firearm, including a short­barreled

And so I believe that any mere

5
Alderson Reporting Company

firearm, is not going to satisfy the definition.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I understand the

3

government's argument, it's that there's a very strong

4

correlation between possession in this case and use for

5

criminal purposes of a kind that clearly would pose a

6

risk of ­­ of violent conduct and injury.

7

saying that we never can take that kind of correlation

8

into account, that possession crimes just have to be

9

treated in a box, and we can't think about whether the

possession of something increases the risk of use which

11

then will pose a serious risk of injury?

response is twofold.

asserted that correlation, they have not substantiated

15

it in any way.

16

that supports the claim that merely possessing a

17

short­barreled shotgun is somehow connected with

frequent or even regular use.

wouldn't be enough?

How many States is it

Your Honor, I believe there's

8

10 States that outright ban possession regardless of

9

compliance with Federal regulations.

And then in the

10

remainder of the States, the question is whether, if its

11

possession is legal in compliance with either State

12

registrations or always in compliance with the Federal

13

registrations.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We've highlighted for the Court 14 different cases on

I believe that using a rocket

note that Michigan just last year changed its mind and

14

made these lawful.

15

legislatures, and indeed Congress in 1934 when it

least the reputation of this gun, that it was associated

with gangster activity in the Prohibition era.

But I think that many State

disagreeing that States are within their rights to ban

Also, Your Honor, the Michigan legislature,

I do think it is a recognition, Your Honor,

that legislatures think these are dangerous weapons, and

they are dangerous weapons, but that does not make their

mere possession violative of the residual clause of the

That's correct, Your Honor,

and I'm glad you reminded me because that was an

11

important point for me to make, is that when we look at

12

these enumerated offenses as providing guidance for the

adopted use of explosives rather than possession.

in fact, in the legislative history, in 1986, they gave

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN F. BASH

19

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES

20
21
22

MR. BASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The ordinary case of possession of a

23

sawed­off shotgun is possession in connection with

24

serious criminal activity.

25

Congress, State legislatures, this Court in Miller and

That is the judgment that

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Heller, and lower courts have reached for 8 decades.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If that's the case, how

3

many charges do you have that are for mere possession,

4

not involved with an underlying crime?

5

MR. BASH:

Most of these charges are brought

6

at the State level, so I don't have sort of the

7

comprehensive statistics.

8

that Petitioner has now had two briefs to come forward

9

with examples of law­abiding citizens just kind of

10
11
12
13

But what I will point out is

caught up in this sawed­off shotgun regime.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

She raises 14 cases in

her reply brief.
MR. BASH:

If you look at all of those

14

cases, Your Honor, the vast majority of them, both cited

15

in the opening brief and in the reply brief, involved

16

people involved in other very serious criminal activity,

17

meth dealing, sexual abuse, assaults.

18

only verify what I think has been this Court's judgment

19

in Heller and Miller, Congress's judgment, the judgment

20

of State legislatures for a long time, that these are

21

exclusively used for unlawful purposes.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So those cases

So why haven't they been

23

outlawed federally and why is it only a minority of

24

States that have outlawed their ­­ just their

25

possession, not their registration?

27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BASH:

Because I think what the National

2

Firearm Act reflects, and this was reflected in Attorney

3

General Cummings' arguments in favor of the law when it

4

was under consideration, is that if you're willing to

5

disclose your fingerprints and photograph to the Federal

6

Government and undergo a background check ­­ that's only

7

by regulation, but undergo a background check, it

8

dissipates the chance that you're going to be involved

9

in crimes.

10

Gang members, terrorists, and bank robbers

11

do not go around disclosing their fingerprints and

12

photograph to the government.

13

atypical gun collections who build collection of, I

14

think, rare firearms, and those are the sorts of

15

applications the ATF sees.

16

So there are some

But I just want to emphasize the point

17

about, sort of, how many of these things are lawfully

18

registered.

19

in our brief, and it's 140,000 lawfully registered ever.

20

It appears that the vast majority of those are to law

21

enforcement agencies or to the manufacturers themselves.

22

Just by way of comparison, the Congressional

23

Research Service put out a gun control analysis in 2012

24

that estimated that there are currently 82 million

25

shotguns of all varieties, either in private hands or

We made a good faith attempt at an estimate

28

available for purchase by private citizens.

2

number of ­­ whether it's 40,000, 50,000 ever, is a

3

vanishingly small number of sawed­off shotguns that have

4

been lawfully registered.

5

So the

I think ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't there something in

6

one of these briefs that a manufacturer in States where

7

these weapons are lawful has advertised them as ideal

8

for use in self­defense?

9

MR. BASH:

There is something like that in

10

one of the briefs.

11

of, market strategy should govern the analysis.

12

certainly shouldn't refute this Court's judgment,

13

Congress's judgment, the judgment of State legislatures

14

for decades, that these weapons have no lawful uses.

15

And I am not aware of, for example, a spike in

16

applications for registrations for sawed­off shotguns to

17

the ATF, which you might expect to see if these weapons

18

were suddenly being in common use for self­defense.

19

I just wanted to address a point that I

I don't think a manufacturer's, sort
It

20

are we, sort of, solely relying on a correlative

potential for violence.

24

than a correlative relationship.

25

precisely the same relationship between the crime and

I think it's a great deal more

3

The enumerated crime enables the potential for violence

4

in a but­for causal sense, but the offender has to take

5

an additional act of volition to bring the violence to

6

fruition.

7

So, for example, with a burglary or an

8

attempted burglary, a burglar could say, if I'm

confronted by a homeowner or police officer, I am going

to flee.

to give up.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I would think the analogy to

15

that is the person who uses the sawed­off shotgun in a

16

crime, but decides:

17

then you say:

18

going to shoot it; you just used it in a criminal

19

activity, that's enough for us.

20

I'm not going to shoot it.

And

It doesn't really matter if you're not

But this is a good deal more attenuated than

21

that because this person could, for whatever reason,

22

maybe because he wants to commit a crime in the future

23

or maybe he's one of the odd collectors or people who

24

think that this is good for self­defense, this person

25

could have kept it in a locked closet, in a safe deposit

box, and never have brought it out and never have any

2

potential for use in a crime.

3

thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of

4

serious injury, but this is a step further.

5

MR. BASH:

I mean, it would be one

I agree that a necessary premise

of our argument is that the ordinary case of possession

7

is possession in connection with crimes.

8

don't buy that, we're in trouble.

9

that.

So if you

But you should buy

It's what this Court said in Heller when it said

10

short­barreled shotguns are not typically used by law

11

abiding citizens for lawful purposes.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But they are two separate

13

offenses, right, possession of this gun and use of this

14

gun.

15

purposes of ACCA.

16

And you're converting the one into the other for

MR. BASH:

And that makes total sense, and

17

let me explain why.

18

the definition of violent felony ­­ it's at 11a of our

19

statutory appendix ­­ would do no work.

20

of that clause is to capture situations that were

21

pregnant with the possibility of violence but where the

22

apprehender was offended before the violence occurred.

23

If an offender used a firearm against somebody, he would

24

be squarely within clause 1, which is the use of force

25

or the threatened or attempted use of force against

If it wasn't like that, clause 2 of

The whole point of clause 2 is when you

3

catch someone who put themselves in the position to do

5

occasion, they still fall within clause 2, and that

makes sense because that sort of behavior is reflective

7

of the armed career criminal.

odd if the illegal possession of this weapon didn't

Do you think the same would

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I'm sure the numbers dwarf the sawed­off shotguns, and

2

the whole point of that is, yes, they're people who have

3

shown themselves to be irresponsible, who have shown

4

themselves perhaps to use weapons irresponsibly, and

5

they're going to do it again, and there's a pretty

6

strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that makes

Congress pass that law.

I think that's an accurate

description of felon in possession, but there are,

10

nevertheless, felons who legitimately want a handgun,

11

which has been in common use for decades, for

12

self­defense or for target practice or whatever.

13

The judgment that this Court has rendered

14

and that Congress has rendered is that these weapons do

not have other purposes in the ordinary case, and I

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

is possession, possession of explosives, an offense

15

under this enhancement provision?

16

MR. BASH:

I think we'd run the same

17

analysis, and we talk about this at pages 47 to 48 of

18

our brief, which is to say explosives regulated by the

19

NFA, which are defined to be explosives designed as

21

run through which ­­

MR. BASH:

No.

And there's no redundancy,

4

because ­­ maybe we explained this unclearly.

5

tried to explain is that the use of explosives would

6

encompass a felony conviction for the use of any

7

explosives.

8

of TNT or dynamite, explosives that are not inherently

9

dangerous in character, but could be used unlawfully.

What we

10

The possession offense under the reasoning

11

that we've set forth in the brief would apply to

12

weaponized explosives, those regulated under the NFA

13

because they're designed as ­­ as weapons, napalm and

14

things like that, not to the unlawful possession of TNT,

15

even though the unlawful use of TNT would fall under the

16

use of explosives statute provided as a felony.

17

don't think there's any redundancy created there.

So I

And I guess just to wrap up this colloquy, I

19

think it's possible to imagine an alternative universe

20

22

case analysis would look very different.

I think that's true.

4

we'd have to build through the practical case, one, that

5

burglar tools ­­ the mere possession of burglar tools is

6

sort of inevitably associated with committing burglary.

7

It may be that there's a lot of people who acquire them,

8

think about committing burglary, but don't make the sort

9

of attempt that James contemplated will result in a

confrontation, and then it's more attenuated because

11

you're linking up this burglary ­­ burglary tools with

12

committing burglary and then burglary with the

confrontation.

14

I think it's a much tighter nexus here.

I

think if you ask an ordinary congressperson whether they

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm a little still
