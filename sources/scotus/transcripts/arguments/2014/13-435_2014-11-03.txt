CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

v. the Laborers District Council Construction Industry

Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON SHANMUGAM

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Like other provisions of the Federal

13

Securities laws, Section 11 of the Securities Act

14

imposes liability only for untrue or misleading

15

statements of material fact.

16

a statement of opinion or belief is the fact that the

17

speaker held the stated belief.

18

The only fact conveyed by

As this Court concluded in Virginia

19

Bankshares v. Sandberg, a statement of opinion or belief

20

can, therefore, be actionable only if the speaker did

21

not actually hold the stated belief.

22

In the decision under review, the Sixth

23

Circuit, alone among the courts of appeals, concluded

24

that this Court's reasoning in Virginia Bankshares did

25

not apply to a claim under Section 11, even though

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Section 11 contains a materially identical falsity

2

requirement to the provision at issue there.

3

the Sixth Circuit's interpretation, nor those of

4

Respondents or the government, can be reconciled either

5

with the plain language of Section 11 or with this

6

Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Neither

So if I say or the

8

company says in a prospectus, we believe that we have

9

3.5 million units of inventory in our secret inventory

10

warehouse, so long as they say we believe, they can't ­­

11

you know, it turns out they have none, that's all right?

12

They're still protected?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that that would

14

probably be a statement of opinion, but it is much

15

closer to the line between statements of opinion and

16

statements of fact.

17

Let me explain ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Really, you think

18

it's an open question if they say it's a very precise

19

number for something that only they know anything about,

20

and it's wildly off, you think they're protected or may

21

be simply by saying "We believe"?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I ­­ I think that ­­

23

the reason why I think it's a close question as to

24

whether or not that would be a statement of opinion is

25

simply because the second restatement's definition of

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what constitutes a statement of opinion, which we think

2

is a useful guide, includes not just statements on

3

matters of judgment, like the statements we have at

4

issue here, but also statements that express uncertainty

5

about factual matters.

6

And I think in your hypothetical, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, you can view that statement as being the

8

equivalent of a factual statement that along the lines

9

of, we have approximately 3 million units or widgets in

10

our inventory, such that if they had nowhere near that,

11

that statement would be an objectively false statement

12

of fact and, therefore, actionable.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But suppose it is actually

14

disputed, an expert ­­ expert ­­ a museum expert on an

15

archaeological mission says, it is my opinion that those

16

bones in that mountain are of a diplodocus and not a

17

Trisopterus.

18

least he'd looked into it, that at least he'd seen the

19

bones?

20

opinion, but there's some things implied.

21

Now, wouldn't you have thought that at

You see, it's absolutely open, it is a matter of

If you had learned later he'd been in a bar

22

all night and had never even seen or heard one word

23

about what the bones were like, wouldn't you think he

24

had issued a misrepresentation?

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Breyer, first,

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that would be clearly a statement of opinion ­­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

4

Yes.
­­ because it's a statement

on a matter of judgment.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.
Our view is that where the

7

speaker does not say anything about the basis for its

8

opinion, the only fact that is being conveyed is the

9

fact of the speaker's belief.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

The plaintiff ­­
Yes.

And I just produced

11

an example because I knew that was your view, and what I

12

looked for was an example where your view doesn't seem

13

quite so reasonable.

14

doesn't seem reasonable there because I think any

15

listener would think that the archaeologist had not been

16

spending all night in the bar, but, rather, had at least

17

looked at the bones or done some basic examination.

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And ­­ and that was why I said it

And so what I would ­­
And that's ­­ now, that's

20

the point I want you to address yourself to, why is that

21

statement I just made wrong?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Sure.
It is my opinion it is

right.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So notwithstanding ­­ so

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notwithstanding the fact that it in our view, Justice

2

Breyer, there is no implied statement of fact there.

3

There may nevertheless be a claim, and that is for the

4

simple ­­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is an implied

6

statement, I think.

7

done some work to figure this out.

8
9

The implied statement is that he's

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well ­­ and I think that we

may end up ultimately getting to the same place because

10

let me explain how we think the analysis would work in

11

that situation.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yeah.
In a situation like that, we

14

believe that the ultimate legal inquiry is whether the

15

speaker did not possess the stated belief.

16

plaintiff would be able to come forward with

17

allegations, in your hypothetical, that the

18

archaeologist spent the evening in the bar, that the

19

archaeologist had no basis for his or her opinion, and

20

in that circumstance, that would be circumstantial

21

evidence that the speaker, in fact, did not possess the

22

stated belief that the bones were those of a diplodocus.

23

And so ­­

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But a

So you're saying that

this evidence, what we're ­­ we're talking about, the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence that the speaker didn't believe what he said,

2

that could be proved by showing he made no investigation

3

at all.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

That is ­­

So ­­ so you're saying

6

that the ­­ whether there was any investigation or

7

whether it was reasonable will factor into whether the

8

belief was honestly held.

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

10
11

Yes, that is correct.

And ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why ­­ and we're

12

dealing with a registration statement.

13

Justice Breyer suggested, implicit that when somebody ­­

14

when an issuer puts something in a registration

15

statement, that the issuer has acted with diligence in

16

making that statement?

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Why isn't it, as

Well, we don't believe that

18

there is any necessary implication from the statement,

19

and we think that that is true regardless of whether or

20

not it appears in a registration statement because,

21

after all, in Section 11, while Congress certainly

22

imposed a heightened obligation on issuers and did so by

23

relaxing other elements of liability, Congress included

24

exactly the same falsity element as it did in a variety

25

of other provisions of the Federal securities law ­­

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

laws.

2

But, again, our view is that for purposes of

3

pleading a claim, a plaintiff is not restricted to

4

smoking gun evidence that the speaker did not possess

5

the stated belief.

6

able to come forward with allegations that cross the

7

pleading threshold of plausibility to suggest that the

8

speaker, in fact, did not hold the stated belief, that

9

will, in fact, be sufficient.

10

And so, again, if a plaintiff is

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that may be true, but

11

do you deny the fact that there can be situations in

12

which a person makes a ­­ makes a statement of belief

13

and believes that to be true, but lacks a reasonable

14

basis for stating the belief?

15

between those two situations, isn't there?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There is a difference

I think there is a

17

difference between those two situations, and I think

18

this illustrates an important conceptual distinction.

19

think in a case where a speaker has no basis whatsoever

20

for the stated belief, there will be comparatively few

21

cases ­­ and I'm certainly not aware of any case from

22

the reported cases in this area ­­ where the speaker

23

held the stated belief but lacked any basis for it

24

whatsoever.

25

However, I think that the government's

9
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

reasonable basis standard, the position of the Solicitor

2

General here, suggests, I think, something more.

3

quite frankly, it's not entirely clear how much more

4

that position would require.

5

the speaker actually arrived at its opinion, and that

6

suggests that the focus may be on the diligence that the

7

speaker conducts.

And,

It seems to focus on how

8

But our view is that once you start getting

9

into a lack of a reasonable belief, you're really

10

getting into a matter of opinion.

11

that however the government's test operates in

12

practice ­­ and, again, I think the government's brief

13

provides ­­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I really do think

What's wrong with that?

15

There's an assumption that there's something wrong with

16

that.

17

securities statements of any kind, wouldn't one want

18

boards, issuers, others to have some sort of reasonable

19

basis ­­ I'm borrowing the government's words ­­ before

20

it goes about making predictive ­­ even predictive

21

statements?

22

But if what one wants is honesty in ­­ in

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So two points in response to

23

that, Justice Sotomayor.

24

being glib, we simply don't think that that is the

25

statute that Congress enacted.

First of all, at the risk of

And certainly, if

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress had wanted to impose an obligation on issuers

2

of essentially providing an implied warranty for any

3

statement of opinion that issuers make in their

4

registration statements, it could have done so, and

5

there are other statutes that impose liability where

6

there is an absence of a reasonable basis.

7

Let me explain why it's problematic as a

8

matter of policy.

9

standard, that is to say, a standard that goes further

We believe that a reasonable basis

10

than the standard that I think Justice Breyer was

11

suggesting, that goes beyond simply saying that you have

12

to have some basis, but that looks at the reasonableness

13

of the basis, opens up issuers to after­the­fact second

14

guessing on matters of judgment.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And just his opinion is something that

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So

And as a practical matter,

7

Justice Breyer, I really do think that our legal

8

standard takes care of that situation because in a

9

situation where the plaintiff is able to make that

10

allegation ­­ and I would note parenthetically that the

11

plaintiffs certainly haven't made that allegation

12

here ­­ it would likely be sufficient to surmount the

13

pleading for ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Shanmugam,

suppose ­­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think that ­­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Justice Scalia.
Do you think there's a

19

difference between a factual basis and a reasonable

20

factual basis?

21

would we accept an unreasonable factual basis?

22

I mean, if we adopted a factual basis rule,

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that really

23

depends on what the reasonable basis stated in the

24

standard actually means.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I think it's ­­

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

it's just the same rule in ­­ in disguise really.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that in the

3

context of legal compliance, if statements of the sort

4

that we have at issue here, I think that ­­ that that

5

context in many ways illustrates the potential

6

difference.

7

So suppose you had an issuer who had two

8

separate legal opinions, one suggesting that a

9

particular practice was legal and the other one was not.

10

Certainly there, I think you would say that the issuer

11

has at least some basis, but it may be open to

12

after­the­fact determination as to whether or not that

13

was a reasonable basis in light of the fact that there

14

was a competing opinion.

15
16
17

Again, it's entirely unclear exactly what
that standard means, I think, in part because it’s a novel standard.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I think Justice Scalia is

18

right there, and there would be something like that,

19

but ­­ and so your point is a ­­ is a good point, that

20

it isn't so easy to figure this out exactly what the

21

standard is.

22

opinion, very detailed, very fact­based, and where

24

people would think some work was being done, and, in

fact, far less work has been done than anybody would

those things?

4

Now, isn't the law designed to catch

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I would say this,

5

Justice Breyer.

6

not contain any reasonable basis requirement, and

7

nothing in this Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares,

8

in our view, suggests such a requirement.

9

don't think that there is any support ­­

10

I mean, again, the statute itself does

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we really

How do you say that about

11

Bankshares, which contains the statement that the

12

Government refers to; conclusory opinions in a

13

commercial context are reasonably understood to rest on

14

a factual basis that justifies them as accurate.

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

And, Justice Ginsburg,

16

that's a statement at page 1093 of the Court's opinion

17

in Virginia Bankshares, and we think that in context

18

that statement stands for the proposition that I've been

19

articulating this morning, namely that where a speaker

20

makes a statement of opinion and has no basis for that

21

statement, that may be relevant in showing disbelief.

22

That may be relevant in showing what the Court went on

23

to say was legally required, namely both subjective

24

disbelief and objective falsity.

25

And before the Sixth Circuit's opinion in

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case, that was the consistent understanding of

2

lower courts in construing this Court's opinion in

3

Virginia Bankshares, and so we certainly think that

4

Virginia Bankshares does not stand for the proposition

5

that an issuer ­­ whenever an issuer makes a statement

6

of opinion, somehow includes in that statement an

7

implied warranty that the speaker has a reasonable basis

8

for that statement.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we adopt your position,

10

which I take it to be that lack of reasonable basis

11

for a statement can be evidence that the belief was not

12

sincerely held, in this case do we still have to remand

13

or did I understand you to say that the plaintiffs below

14

did not specifically allege that there was no reasonable

15

basis at all for the statement?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So two things.

Two things

17

on that point, Justice Kennedy.

18

that the legal standard here turns on subjective

19

disbelief, which again we believe was the holding of

20

this Court in Virginia Bankshares, then the plaintiffs

21

here are foreclosed because the plaintiffs disclaimed

22

any allegation based on a state of mind, which is to say

23

that the plaintiffs in this case, in an effort to

24

exclude ­­ to avoid being subject to the heightened

25

pleading standard of Rule 9(b) ­­

If you adopt our view

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shanmugam, I thought

2

that the complaint alleged that the defendants had no ­­

3

that no defendant had a reasonable ground to believe

4

that Omnicare’s arrangements were lawful.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, and that was going to

6

be my second point, Justice Ginsburg.

7

clear, there are two paragraphs of the complaint that we

8

think are relevant here.

9

which is the paragraph in which the plaintiffs

So just to be

The first is Paragraph 178,

10

disclaimed any allegation relying on fraud or

11

intentional misconduct.

12

legal standard that forecloses plaintiffs in this case

13

from going forward.

14

really dispute that under our legal standard their claim

15

is foreclosed.

16

suggest that their claim could nevertheless go forward.

17

And we think that under our

I would note that plaintiffs don't

They make no effort in their brief to

Now, if this Court were to adopt the

18

Solicitor General's legal standard and to say that the

19

legal standard here is whether or not there was a

20

reasonable basis for the opinion, this Court would

21

obviously have to vacate and remand because that was not

22

the legal standard that the Sixth Circuit applied.

23

think that we would have a very strong argument on

24

remand that we should, nevertheless, prevail because the

25

plaintiffs in this case have pointed only to the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

We

1

conclusory allegation that you identified,

2

Justice Ginsburg, and that is the allegation in

3

Paragraph 183 that says that none of the defendants had

4

a reasonable ground to believe in the statements in the

5

registration statement.

6

If the inquiry in this case focuses on how

7

the speaker arrived at its opinion, this complaint is

8

really threadbare in terms of allegations that relate to

9

that issue, and so we've ­­ but that would be an issue

10

for the Sixth Circuit on remand.
JUSTICE ALITO:

If the test is subjective as

12

you claim, with respect to the issuer, whose subjective

13

state of mind should ­­ must the Court look at?

14

it be solely the person who signs on behalf of the

15

issuer, or would it be everyone else who is required by

16

law to sign the registration statement?

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Would

So I think that the inquiry

18

would be much the same as the inquiry with regard to

19

claims that have a scienter requirement, such as claims

20

under Section 10(b).

21

little bit of disagreement in the lower courts about how

22

broad the category of individuals at an issuer is, whose

23

state of mind is relevant, but the inquiry generally

24

focuses on those who either made or approved the

25

statement at issue.

I would note that there is a

an omission that makes the statements misleading?

17

Now, why isn't that something where there is

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So we don't think that there

18

is an omission under that circumstance because we think

19

that the only fact that is being disclosed by the

20

statement is the fact of the speaker's belief, and if

21

you look at the relevant language on which respondents

22

and the Government really focus, it is that language

23

concerning omissions.

24

falsity.

25

on the fact at issue.

It's not the language concerning

And that language focuses time and time again
So it refers to omissions,

19

1

omission to state a material fact.

2

omitted has to be a fact necessary to make the

3

statements therein, and I think that's a reference back

4

to statements of material fact ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it just says

6

statements therein.

7

of material fact or not.

8
9

And so what is

It doesn't actually say statements

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that's most

naturally a reference back to the language a couple

10

volumes earlier about statements of material fact, and I

11

think this all just underscores the fact that Congress

12

in this provision did not impose a broad affirmative

13

duty to speak, nor did it impose liability on untrue or

14

misleading statements.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it didn't ­­ it didn't

16

impose an obligation to speak, but once you speak, it

17

said that you're ­­ that you can't make omissions that

18

make your speech ­­ your statements misleading.

19

guess what I'm saying is, you know, what I've given you

20

is a case where this is a judgment call, whether you

21

think something is legal or not.

22

And I

But what you know ­­ and after all you're in

23

the position to know and all your readers are not in a

24

25

seems to disagree, that your competitors seem to

What you know is that the Government

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disagree, and that most of the lawyers seem to disagree.

2

And still you're going to put this in your statement and

3

say, oh, no problem, that's not misleading.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, in your hypothetical,

5

Justice Kagan, you know, I think ­­ there are two points

6

I would make about it.

7

fact that is being conveyed is the fact of the

8

speaker's belief, and that is what makes the statement

9

material, which is to say that when you have statements

10

of opinion in a registration statement, the reason that

11

they are material is precisely because it is

12

management's view on a particular question.

The first is that, again, the

13

And so when you have a statement of that

14

variety, that is the fact that has to be shown to be

15

either false or misleading.

16

does not possess the stated opinion, the statement is

17

false.

18

Obviously if the speaker

But we don't believe ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But don't you think a

19

reasonable reader would look at that statement and say

20

two things actually:

21

to check as to whether the transaction is legal, and he

22

doesn't know anything that's very dispositive going the

23

other way.

24

false.

25

Both, he's done something to try

And both of those things, I mean, could be

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think where a speaker says

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nothing about the basis for the opinion, there are

2

obviously a spectrum of potential bases for the opinion

3

that the speaker could have, and so, again, we don't

4

think that there is any necessary implication about the

5

scope of the basis for the opinion.

6

Now, again, if it's a case where the speaker

7

truly has no basis for the opinion, we believe it will

8

be quite possible for a plaintiff to include all

9

these underlying allegations about the basis as a way of

10
11

showing subjective disbelief.
And so what that really leaves you with, we

12

would respectfully submit, is the hypothetical situation

13

in which a speaker in the face of overwhelming contrary

14

evidence and no basis nevertheless adheres to a genuine

15

belief, and the question of whether or not liability

16

should lie in those circumstances.

17

And our view is simply that it is not worth

18

the candle to frame the legal standard in a way as to

19

cover that entirely hypothetical situation.

20

And in part, to get back to

21

Justice Sotomayor's question from the beginning of the

22

argument, that is because it is important to underscore

23

the fact that this is a statute that imposes strict

24

liability.

25

Dahl, when it comes to statutes that impose strict

And as this Court explained in Pinter versus

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

liability, issuers really need to have certainty and

2

predictability.

3

And a legal standard that focuses on

4

reasonable basis is going to open up issuers to

5

after­the­fact second­guessing by jurors about whether

6

or not a particular basis is reasonable.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I don't think,

8

Mr. Shanmugam, that the fact that the statue has ­­ is a

9

strict liability statute might cut the other way.

Why

10

is it a strict liability statute?

11

some understanding, number one, that it was the issuer

12

who knows the facts, not the readers; and number two,

13

that it is awfully hard to show subjective intent.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Because Congress had

Well, Congress dealt with

15

the context of registration statements precisely by

16

relaxing the other elements of liability that of course

17

exist under other provisions of the securities laws.

18

And what that leaves us with is a statute where this

19

falsity element is really the entire ball game because

20

elements such as reliance and loss causation are no

21

longer affirmative elements of liability.

22

And, of course, what that means is not only

23

that it is easier for plaintiffs ultimately to prove

24

liability but that it is also easier for plaintiffs to plead

25

a claim under this provision.

And I do think that a

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable basis standard, depending on how that

2

standard is framed, could make it very difficult for

3

issuers to avoid liability at the pleading stage.

4

And as, of course, this Court has recognized

5

in the securities context, obtaining resolution of these

6

claims on a dispositive motion is often, as a practical

7

matter, the only way in which defendants can avoid

8

liability because of the pressures of settlement in

9

cases of this variety.

10
11

Unless the Court has any further questions,
I'll reserve the balance of my time.

important point.

6

I think the critical thing is to

And they did not make this argument in the

10

district court or the court of appeals here that you

11

have to look at the full context of the opinion and see

12

whether the party is actually fully hedging.

13

Now, point 2 is that there are statements

14

that we are relying in our complaint that aren't like

15

that.

16

you one good example, and I'll take you to page 192.

17

And this is our allegation about therapeutic

interchange.

19

cases, including with the government over whether they

20

were switching their patients' drugs in order to have an

21

arrangement that was more profitable to them but not

22

good for the patient.

23

interchange, as implemented by them, was illegal.

24
25

If I could take you to the Joint Appendix to give

We allege ­­ and they settled a bunch of

5

So this is an instance in the registration

6

statement where they didn't have any of that hedging.

7

is that either of two things is implied by that.

25

very hard to understand why Congress would have written

Remember, that it is

34
Alderson Reporting Company

1

a statute that says you're going to be strictly liable

2

for misrepresentations, and we're going to ignore the

3

fact that the reason you state opinions in a

4

registration statement is precisely so that people will

5

rely on them.

6

The whole point of having these in the

7

registration statement is to persuade people about the

8

state of the company, about the state of what it's

9

doing, about its profitability and the like.

And if you

10

announce a legal rule that says we're going ­­ so long

11

as you put the words "we believe" in front of any of

12

those sentences, then what you're going to have is a

13

situation in which every single time when Congress is

14

trying to make sure that the company speaks truthfully,

15

the plaintiff is going to be held to the burden of

16

proving what's inside people's heads.

14

sentences, "as statements that the directors do act for

Okay.

Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

The parties have offered you two extreme

21

positions, and we think that the answer lies in the

22

middle.

23

language of the statute because it's not the case as

24

petitioner suggests that the statute only requires that

25

you make statements that are literally accurate.

And this is an answer that comes right from the

43
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

statute says that you have to make statements that are

2

both literally accurate and not misleading as to a ­­

3

that there cannot be a material omission.

4

And this is a ­­ this is really a standard

5

that makes sense in the context of this particular case

6

where we're talking about whether something in a

7

registration statement has a reasonable basis.

8
9

And I want to clarify what we mean by
reasonable basis.

We mean a basis that would be

10

expected under the circumstances, that a lack of a

11

reasonable basis is what makes an omitted fact make the

12

statement about the opinion misleading.

13

So to answer Justice Alito's question, a

14

plaintiff has the burden to come into court and provide

15

an omitted fact that should have been put in the

16

statement of opinion or provided along with it in order

17

to make it not misleading.

18

And that has ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it seem ­­ it seems

19

to me that you're not in the middle, that you're almost

20

90 percent with the respondent because you give very

21

little weight to the subjective belief component.

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

We think that the ­­ you

23

could establish liability either way.

24

Court of Appeals kind of addressed two questions, and we

25

agree with the Court of Appeals halfway.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

It's really the

The first

Official

1

question is do you always have to have subjective

2

disbelief to recover under Section 11 for an opinion.

3

The Court of Appeals correctly said the answer to that

4

was no.

5

But then to ­­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you ­­ I ­­ I ­­ are

7

you disavowing Virginia Bankers?

8

you need two things, you need subjective disbelief

9

and/or not quite, but you need an objective fact that's

Virginia Bankers says

10

not true, meaning you need to prove the falsity of the

11

objective fact?

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, with respect, we don't

22

So what mental state are you saying
Either they didn't believe what they

That's right.

Either they

23

didn't believe what they were saying, or there was no

24

reasonable basis for what they were saying.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do we ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

And to ­­

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You were asking, in

2

Justice Kennedy's, you said it was right and wrong, and

3

then you got the part out about it being right.

4

in what way was it wrong?

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

What ­­

The way in which the Sixth

6

Circuit decision was wrong is because it suggested this

7

idea of liability by hindsight, that if there is

8

something that you give an opinion on about legality and

9

it's later proven or later ­­ later established to be

10

false by a ­­ untrue by a court, that you could be found

11

liable by hindsight, and we think that's not true.

12

What matters is the state of mind and the

13

basis that you had at the time the registration

14

statements were made.

15

the language of the text of the statute which focuses on

16

when the registration statement became effective.

17

But just to make clear, and, again, in

And that's actually directly in

18

response to Justice Alito's question, this is a

19

context­specific inquiry, and the burden is on the

20

plaintiff to come forward with an omitted material fact

21

that should have been stated.

22

an opinion, the kinds of things that would be omitted

23

material facts that would matter are things that

24

undercut a basis that you would expect.

25

a lack of any investigation whatsoever.

And in the context about

46
Alderson Reporting Company

So it could be

But it could be, as Justice Kagan said, that

against you.

And several courts have held

Those are the kind of facts.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But this is always going to

situation for a plaintiff to allege that the ­­ that the

issuer did not make a reasonable investigation because

if ­­ if they had done a reasonable investigation, they

13

would have discovered that X wasn't true.

14

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, with respect, I'm not

15

sure that that's true because of the stringent pleading

16

standards that are in place.

they need to meet the particularity standard for fraud,

23

24

there is, in fact, a burden on the plaintiffs.

25

And one point that I want to make is that

Alderson Reporting Company

So

1

this is the kind of inquiry that comes up in omissions

2

cases all the time.

3

and has to say with facts behind it, There's something

4

that was omitted that matters.

5

The question is the plaintiff says,

And the question ultimately for the finder

6

of fact to decide is did it make the statement

7

misleading or not, and that is a very context­specific

8

discussion.

But ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

You know, one thing that I would suggest to

21

the Court by way of reassurance, is both that the Court

22

has addressed a number of omissions cases and asking,

23

you know, is the kind of information something that

24

should have been included to make the statement not

25

misleading, but also that the standard that we're

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talking about, the lack of a basis, has deep roots in

2

the common law, it's been the long­standing position of

3

the SEC, and there are numerous courts that have used

4

this standard, including the Third Circuit's decision in

5

the Trump case, the Weiss case that's cited in our

6

brief.

7
8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think that there are

specific omissions in this case?
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, the case wasn't really

10

pleaded the way that we conceive of it in terms of the

11

lack of a reasonable basis, so we do think the

12

appropriate thing for the Court to do would be to

13

provide appropriate instructions to the lower courts,

14

send this case back, and potentially allow this case to

15

be repleaded because of the fact that we do think there

16

was a kernel of this lack of reasonable basis idea in

17

two places in the complaint in this case.

18

The one is the relatively conclusory

19

statement in Section 183 of the complaint that there was

20

not a reasonable basis, but then there was also, as

21

Mr. Goldstein noted, paragraphs 89 and 90 of the

22

complaint, which were specific facts that were alleged

23

about the company's attorney saying with respect to one

24

of the specific contracts, this contract has all the

25

kick ­­ the hallmarks of a kickback, an illegal kickback,

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that is the kind of thing that potentially is an

2

omission that could be material and could make the other

3

statements in the registration statement misleading if

4

you don't provide such information.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, do you think that

6

Twombly in this ­­ in this context requires the

7

plaintiff to allege what kind of investigation was

8

conducted before there is discovery?

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that that would be a

10

case­specific determination, but I don't think that that

11

under Twombly and Iqbal, that the ­­ that the plaintiff

But another ­­ another point I think that

16

might be helpful to the Court is that this is really ­­

17

this no reasonable basis standard is really something

18

that polices the egregious cases because it has to be

19

the case that the plaintiff can come forward with

20

information and that the basis that the company had is

21

really outside the bounds of reasonableness, and we need

22

to have it for egregious cases, for example, if there

with respect to opinions specifically, but in general,

shouldn't be put in registration statements without

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Saharsky, does this

affect not only the private right of action?

uncertain whether it also affected the SEC's ability to

12

stop a registration statement which it thought had a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
This is the rarer case in which none of the

16

parties is defending the reasoning of the court of

17

appeals below.

18

appeals in this case held that the falsity requirement

19

in Section 11 operates differently because Section 11 is

20

a strict liability statute, and that's the reasoning at

21

page 47 of the Joint Appendix.

And just to reiterate, the court of

22

So the real question before this Court is

23

whether to reverse outright, as we submit this Court

24

should do, or to vacate and remand for application of a

25

somewhat different legal standard such as the reasonable

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

basis standard.
I want to really set out three reasons in

3

this rebuttal why we believe that the Court should

4

reverse outright.

5

First of all, I want to focus on the text of

6

the statute.

7

that you and I were having, and the similar colloquy

8

that you also had with my colleagues at the bar, whether

9

or not there is a reasonable basis is not a fact that

And to go to the colloquy, Justice Kagan,

10

can be said to be omitted, and that is for the precise

11

reason that this test is not simply a "some basis"

12

standard.

13

requires some evaluation of whether the basis is

14

sufficient.

15

This is a reasonable basis standard that

And so that is really a judgment.

It is

16

really a matter of opinion, and I don't think that it

17

can fairly be said to be a fact that is omitted.

18

again, as I suggested earlier ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

But there might be omitted

20

facts, such as I didn't check with any of my lawyers, or

21

I checked with my lawyers and they told me the opposite.

22

I mean, those are facts, and that's the thing that makes

23

the statement in the registration statement itself

24

misleading.

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And so the only point I

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would add is the point that I think I made in my opening

2

argument, which is that the statement of material fact

3

here is still the statement of the opinion, and there is

4

nothing misleading about that statement as to that

5

stated fact.

6

of the issuer or it isn't.

7

that Mr. Goldstein in his argument ­­

8
9

That is to say, either that is the opinion

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think it was telling

But I think what

Ms. Saharsky is saying, maybe not Mr. Goldstein, is that

10

there's another part of the statute which is omissions,

11

and that those omissions of facts ­­ I didn't check with

12

anybody or I checked with everybody and they said the

13

exact opposite ­­ that's the thing that makes my own

14

statement misleading, and that's why it fits within the

15

statute.

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Right, but it still has to

17

be an omission that is, in the words of the statute,

18

"necessary to make the statements therein not

19

misleading."

20

therein are really the statements of material fact.

And again, we think that the statements

21

Now, Mr. Goldstein made a somewhat different

22

textual argument, and I want to address that, too, just

23

to kind of lay all of our cards on the table.

24

that, in essence, because this concept of due diligence,

25

this concept of having a reasonable belief, exists in

56
Alderson Reporting Company

He argued

Official

1

the affirmative defense, that this Court can somehow

2

just import that concept into the affirmative falsity

3

requirement.

4

To me, that really illustrates why this is a

5

profoundly atextual view, because in essence what he is

6

saying is that, although Congress incorporated a

7

reasonableness standard in certain specific contexts

8

with regard to defenses for persons other than the

9

issuer, you should impose it as an affirmative

10

requirement with regard to statements of opinion whoever

11

the speaker is.

12
13
14

And again, we simply don't think that can be
squared with the text of the statute.
I would note a couple of further things in

15

response to Ms. Saharsky's argument as to the text here.

16

First of all, as I said in my opening, if Congress

17

wanted to specifically impose liability in the absence

18

of a reasonable basis, it certainly could have done so.

19

There are statutes outside the securities context that

20

use that phrase in order to impose liability.

21

But second, to the extent that the SEC views

22

this as a massive problem, the SEC certainly could

23

promulgate a rule under its authority under Section 19

24

of the Securities Act, which allows the SEC to specify

25

what should be included in a registration statement.

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And the SEC in fact has somewhat broader power than

2

Ms. Saharsky suggests because, while it is true that the

3

SEC stop order power under Section 8(d) uses similar

4

language, the SEC also has the power to prevent a

5

registration statement from going into effect under

6

Section 8(b) where that statement is inaccurate or

7

incomplete in any respect.

8
9

In our view, that is broader language that
would give the SEC somewhat more expansive authority if

10

it believed that a statement of opinion is objectively

11

false.

12

With regard to Virginia Bankshares, I would

13

just note one thing in response to Justice Sotomayor's

14

question, and that is that, as we point out at page 10

15

of our reply brief, there was no jury finding in

16

Virginia Bankshares on the issue of subjective

17

disbelief.

18

jury's finding precisely because this Court believed

19

that what it meant for a statement of this variety to be

20

false was for the speaker to have acted with subjective

21

disbelief.

22

we said in our reply brief.

23

confirmation of that proposition.

24
25

This Court was instead characterizing the

And again, I would point the Court to what
We cite the verdict form as

Third, I want to say just a word about the
policy considerations here, pro and con a reasonable

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basis standard.

2

that that standard is amorphous, and I don't think that

3

anything that's taken place in the intervening half an

4

hour has dispelled that proposition.

5

As I pointed out earlier, we believe

Ms. Saharsky says that whether or not a

6

basis is reasonable is whether or not the basis is one

7

that would be expected under the circumstances, and I

8

would respectfully submit that that really doesn't

9

provide much more by way of clarity, and it certainly

10

would make it very easy for a plaintiff to plead a claim

11

under this legal standard because all they would

12

presumably have to say is that the basis is not that

13

that was expected under the circumstances.

14

And as Mr. Goldstein said, this inquiry

15

would be very context specific, and again in a context

16

where issuers really require predictability and

17

certainty, we believe that that is cold comfort.

18

There is one other policy consideration,

19

however, which I didn't mention earlier that I just want

20

to mention very briefly.

21

of opinion that are required to be included in

22

registration statements.

23

24

these securities is valid.

There are very few statements

2

standard ­­ an amorphous liability standard like the

3

reasonable basis standard will really have a chilling

4

effect in cases of this variety.

5

And we, therefore, believe that a

And I would note, as was illustrated in the

6

discussion with Mr. Goldstein, that in this case most of

7

the statements at issue were accompanied by cautionary

8

language, and I think that the reason why that is so is

9

that the reason why companies like Omnicare make

10

disclosures like this is precisely to warn about the

11

risks of doing business.

12

If you take a look at ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What would be your

13

position if those qualifying statements that do appear

14

just before and just after this belief statement were

15

omitted?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, our view would be the

17

same in the sense that we certainly think that

18

subjective disbelief would still be required, and of

19

course we believe that that is the holding of this

20

Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares as it has been

21

understood.

22

But I make the point for a somewhat

23

different reason, which is simply to illustrate why

24

issuers believe that it is desirable to make statements

25

of this variety, and if issuers are subject to liability

under an amorphous standard they will simply omit to do

so.
