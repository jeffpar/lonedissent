ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 2

10

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Question 2 Petitioners are already

11

married.

12

relationships, and they have a liberty interest that is

13

of fundamental importance to these couples and their

14

children.

They have established those enduring

15

A State should not be allowed to effectively

16

dissolve that marriage without a sufficiently important

17

justification to do so.

18

These Petitioners have built their lives

19

around their marriages, including bringing children into

20

their families, just as opposite­sex couples have done.

21

But the non­recognition laws undermine the stability of

22

these families, though the States purport to support

23

just such stability.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

I was somewhat surprised by

the arguments you made in your brief because they are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

largely a repetition of the arguments that we just heard

2

with respect to Question 1.

3

I thought the point of Question 2 was

4

whether there would be a ­­ an obligation to recognize a

5

same­sex marriage entered into in another State where

6

that is lawful even if the State itself,

7

constitutionally, does not recognize same­sex marriage.

8

I thought that's the question in Question 2.

9

wrong?

10

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Is ­­ am I

It is the question

11

in Question 2, and this Court's decisions establish that

12

there is not only a right to be married, but a right to

13

remain married; that there is a protected liberty

14

interest in the status of one's marriage once it has

15

been established under law.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even ­­ even if that

17

marriage is ­­ is not lawful under ­­ under the

24

Does a State have to acknowledge that marriage?

25

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

the State could assert justifications for not doing so,

That it's contrary to the State's

Well, no, Your

Honor.

11

12

polygamous relationship would raise all kinds of

13

questions that the State's marriage laws don't address.

14

I think that the justification would be that the

marriage in this State, which we constitutionally can

17

have because the second question assumes that the first

question comes out the way the United States does not

19

want it to come out, the State says we only have the

20

institution of heterosexual marriage.

21

institution of same­sex marriage.

22

We don't have such an institution.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

No.

The

23

institution is the institution of marriage, and the

experience of those States ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you're saying that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

but the State doesn't.

2

institution we have is heterosexual marriage.

3

The State says the only

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

The ­­ the point

4

I'm making, Your Honor, I think is demonstrated by what

5

has happened in those States where, by court order,

6

States have had to permit same­sex couples to marry.

7

All that has happened under their laws is

8

that they have had to remove gender­specific language

9

and substitute it with gender­neutral language.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, could I ­­ could

11

I ­­ because I don't ­­ if you want to finish answering

12

Justice Scalia's ­­

13

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I was going to say

that ­­ that plural relationships raise all manner of

15

questions that are not addressed by this State's current

16

marriage laws.

What if it's not a plural

18

relationship?

19

20

21

be obligated to recognize that marriage?

22

What if one State says that individuals

24

instance, a sufficiently important interest in

25

protecting the true consent of the married person.

But the State would have, in that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

And ­­ and most States don't recognize minors' ability

2

to consent, certainly not to something that is as

3

important as marriage.

4

But what we see, in fact, is that, quite in

5

contrast to the non­recognition laws at issue here, the

6

States do recognize the marriages of person who, by age,

7

would not have been able to marry within their own

8

States.

9

That is the long­standing practice of all of

10

the States, precisely because of the abomination, as it

11

was referred to in the old treatises, of the notion that

12

a ­­ persons could have a different marital state in

13

some jurisdictions than others.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I think that

22

the ­­ that the constitutional test is the one that the

23

Court set forth in the Zablocki, which is does the State

24

have a sufficiently important interest not to recognize

25

it?

And certainly in the case of incest, the State does

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

have a sufficiently important interest.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

They're not biologically tied.

4

This is not incest.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Well, the States

5

that I'm aware of that have the rules against cousin

6

marriage do so under their incest statutes, and they

7

simply define incest in a broad way that would encompass

8

cousins to marry.

9

At some point, certainly the familial

10

relationship is too extenuated that I don't think the

11

State would have a sufficiently important justification.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But Justice Alito's

13

question points out, the assumption of his hypothetical

14

is ­­ and ­­ and of the way these cases are presented,

15

is that the State does have a sufficient interest so

16

that you need not allow the marriages in those ­­ in

17

that State.

18

So there is a sufficient interest, under our

19

arguendo assumption here, to ­­ to say that this is not

20

a fundamental right.

21

of State it's different.

22

have to yield?

23

But then suddenly, if you're out
Why ­­ why should the State

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Well, at the very

24

least, you would have to analyze differently the

25

interest that the State might assert for not allowing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

couples to enter marriage versus the ­­ the interest

2

that they assert as related to a couple who is already

3

married.

4

For example, Kentucky has asserted that its

5

interest in only permitting opposite­sex couples to

6

marry is to increase the birthrate.

7

that theory to same­sex couples who are already married.

8

They are already married in the States where they were

9

married.

10
11

Well, now apply

They are already married in half the States in

the country.
Kentucky would have the Court believe that

12

it is a sufficiently important interest to have that

13

couple disregard their existing marriage vows and

14

obligations to each other to marry someone else in

15

Kentucky in order to procreate biologically even though

16

the couple may already have children together.

17

would dare say, is not a rational justification, much

18

less a sufficiently important one.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That, I

Well, I think ­­ I think

20

what Kentucky is saying is that the long­term effects of

21

having same­sex couples in Kentucky will be, which

22

you ­­ you didn't agree with, but what ­­ what counsel

23

for Respondent argued in the prior case, will be a ­­ a

24

reduction in ­­ in ­­ in heterosexual marriages and a ­­

25

a reduction in the number of children born to those

marriages.

I mean, that ­­

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Your Honor, this

3

Court has rejected that type of speculation as a basis

4

for drawing these distinctions before as it did in

5

Loving.

The State in Loving argued that it was too

7

soon to know what the effect of interracial marriages

8

would be and what the stigma would be on their children

9

if not the biological ­­

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we will not have

11

rejected it if we come out the way this question

12

presented assumes we have come out.

okay for a State not to permit same­sex marriage.

marriage provides for children.

19

justify extinguishing marriages that already exist.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That interest does not

May we clear this one

21

thing.

22

then the argument is moot; right?

If the Petitioner prevails in the first case,

23

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

24

absolutely right, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's ­­ that's

So you are supposing a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

situation where the Plaintiffs do not prevail, and so a

2

State can retain its ban on same­sex marriage.

3

The question is has ­­ does it have to

4

recognize marriage from out of State?

5

difference if the couple came from the State where there

6

is a ban on same­sex marriage, goes to a neighboring

7

State that allows it, and then comes right back home

8

again?

9

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Would it make any

No, Your Honor.

I

10

don't think that there would be such a distinction.

11

And, in fact, none of these four States draws that kind

12

of line that Your Honor presupposes.

13

the points that's so important here, is that as the

14

Court observed with respect to DOMA in Windsor, the

15

nonrecognition laws here are a stark departure from the

16

State's traditional practice of recognizing out­of­state

17

marriages even though they could not have been

18

celebrated within the State.

19

circumstance where the laws diverge that the issue

20

arises.

21

And that's one of

It's precisely that

And the ­­ the three States that have this

22

issue, Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky, are, between them,

23

able to identify only 5 instances in which they did not

24

recognize a marriage that was valid outside the State,

25

even though it could not have been celebrated inside.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

And those instances are incest, which we think the State

2

would have sufficiently important justification not to

3

recognize, miscegenation laws, not a precedent on which

4

I think the Court would want to rely in this instance,

5

or other interests that I think probably would not

6

survive today, such as the ­­ the rule against allowing

7

a divorced person to remarry.

8
9

So they're ­­ and ­­ and more importantly,
the most recent of those cases is from 1970.

So the

10

rule that the States cite about their ability to

11

disregard, to effectively dissolve marriages that

12

already exist, around which people have already begun to

13

build their lives, is less applied than the Federal

14

government's own authority to define the ­­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

But, again, I

16

think you're avoiding the presumption on which we're

17

starting, on the assumption, which is that the State's

18

policy for same ­­ supporting same­sex marriage is

19

sufficiently strong, that they are ­­ they can, as a

20

matter of public policy, prohibit that in their own

21

State.

22

weaker when you're talking about marriages from other

23

States.

24
25

And yet you're saying it's somehow so much

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I ­­ I think there

are a couple of points that I'd like to make in order to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

distinguish this situation from the ­­ the question in

2

the first case.

3

In the first case, it was very significant

4

that Respondents' counsel was emphasizing that he

5

thought it was merely rational basis scrutiny that would

6

apply.

7

should be allowed to marry in the first instance.

8
9

But that was to the question of whether people

Our Petitioners on Question 2 are already
married.

We know from Windsor, because the Court held,

10

that once married, a couple has a constitutionally

11

protected liberty interest in their marriage.

12

We also know from Windsor that where a ­­ a

13

sovereign disregards that marriage in a way that would

14

be extraordinary and out of character with tradition,

15

that that requires, at the very least, careful

16

consideration.

And that's ­­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

19
20

It certainly ­­
­­ what we have

here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It certainly

21

undermines the State interest that we would, assuming

22

arguendo, have recognized in the first case, to say that

23

they must welcome in their borders people who have been

24

married elsewhere.

25

until they would, in effect, be recognizing that within

2

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

Well ­­
Because we live in a

very mobile society, and people move all the time.

5

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And ­­ and ­­
In other words, it

7

would kind of ­­ it ­­ one State would basically set the

8

policy for the entire nation.

9

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Well, of course,

10

there would be many fewer such couples raising children

11

within their borders than heterosexual couples who are

12

raising children who are not biologically linked to

13

them.

14

I have to say that I think that the

15

arguments that the State has made are so over and

16

underinclusive at the same time, that they leave the ­­

17

the feeling that it can only be pretext.

18

that that's true, because the State not only can't draw

The age 13, I think

instead of 16, that the courts probably would recognize

it, especially if, in reliance on their marriage, the ­­

17

the couple had already conceived of a child, it would do

no one any good to destroy that marriage and the stable

environment that it might provide for the children, just

20

as it does no one any good ­­ it certainly doesn't

York's law.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's not what I said.
Because it is clear that

6

if the law of the two States is the same, that was used

against Fedder, that the State cannot say we won't apply

8

the other State's law, even though it's the same as our

MR. WHALEN:

Even though it's the same as

(Laughter.)

4

MR. WHALEN:

My ­­ my answer is based on

5

essentially this Court's decision in Nevada v. Hall,

6

because the State's own law sets its own policy and the

7

other State's law would be in conflict with that State's

8

policy.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But here the policy would

10

be we distrust Federal judges from outside the State.

11

And even that, they would get away with, in your view,

12

because I'm next going to ask, and what is the

13

difference between that kind of policy and the policy

14

that says, well, we don't recognize the gay couple's

15

marriage for the reason that we fear that if gay couples

16

get married, even if they have children and adopt them,

17

and even if we allow people who are not gay to get

18

married and they don't have children, despite all that,

19

this policy, which I've had a little trouble

20

understanding, warrants not recognizing it?

21

follow that question?

22

MR. WHALEN:

Did you

It was a little complicated.
I ­­ I probably did not, but

I'm going to try to answer.

focus is not just that there's a policy, but that

25

there's a legitimate policy.

I ­­ I think the underlying

And as this Court's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

questions earlier indicated, I proceed now on the

2

assumption that the Court has decided the first question

3

in the State's favor, and is determined that, indeed,

4

the State's policy to maintain a traditional man­woman

5

definition of marriage is, indeed, legitimate, and we

obviously agree that it is, and the Court should so

decide.

the comparison between how States have operated with

the phenomenon of same­sex marriage.

And here's the reason:

The ­­

commentators have

observed that when all States are on the same page about

10

what marriage is, that's where the place of celebration

MR. WHALEN:

I ­­ I think that the ­­ the

3

performing of a marriage is closer to law is because, in

4

essence, when the marriage is performed, all the rights

5

that flow from that State's laws evolve to that couple.

6

And it's different than judgments and so does not

7

deserve the same kind of treatment that judgments would,

And that ­­ and that's my point, is that as

This second question puts

21

both you and Mr. Hallward­Driemeier in a very unusual

22

situation, because, first of all, we have to assume that

23

this first question has been decided against the

24

Petitioner, or we wouldn't get to the second question.

25

So we have to assume that we would hold that

2

opposite­sex couples.

3

acknowledged that a State could refuse to recognize an

4

out­of­state marriage if it has a very strong public

5

policy against that marriage, if it's a polygamous

6

marriage, if it's a ­­ a marriage of very young

individuals.

And Mr. Hallward­Driemeier

So the question is whether there could be
something in between.

So there ­­ there's a ­­ a

10

sufficient reason to ­­ for the State to say, we're not

11

going to grant these licenses ourselves, but not a

12

strong enough reason for us not to recognize a marriage

13

isn't it?

15

MR. WHALEN:

I suppose that's possible,

Well, let me answer it this

16

way, and hopefully I'll ­­ I'm answering your question

in doing so.

18

justifications that have grown over time and the

requirement for a strong public policy reason to decline

20

to recognize a marriage have grown up around the

21

man­woman definition.

22

Let me be clear.

The ­­ the

Our position is that so long as we're

23

talking about a marriage from another State that is not

25

interest in maintaining a cohesive and a coherent

internal State policy with regard to marriage that

2

justifies not recognizing those marriages.

3

Otherwise, as ­­ as the question that was

4

put earlier indicated, any resident of the State could

5

go to another State, get married, come back and demand

6

to have their ­­ their marriage recognized.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That happens already.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 2
MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Thank you, Your

Honor.
If I may start with the assertion that

10

Tennessee law has always rooted parental relations in

11

biology, that is not so.

12

to quote from chapter 361.1. ­­ I mean ­­ sorry.

13

68.3.306 referred to on page 15 of our reply.

14

provides that a child born to a married woman as a

15

result of an artificial insemination with consent of the

16

married woman's husband, the father is deemed the

17

legitimate child of the husband and wife, though the

18

husband has no biological relationship with the child.

19

Tennessee law ­­ and I'm going
It's

It

Tennessee, in other words, just as it does

20

with adoption, reinforces the bonds of parent and child

21

irregardless of biology, as long as the ­­ a

22

parent ­­ or as long as the couple is of opposite sexes.

23

The import of that for real people, like

24

Drs. Tanco and Jesty, is that they, who fell in love and

25

married while in graduate school in New York, as many

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

academic couples, were only able to find a position at a

2

same university in Tennessee.

3

Dr. Tanco has given birth to their daughter in

4

Tennessee.

5

They moved there, and

Now, as a result of the nonrecognition laws,

6

when, as occurred last week, their daughter is

7

hospitalized, Tennessee would treat Dr. Jesty not as

8

mom, but as a legal stranger with no right to visit her

9

child, no right to make medical decisions for her.

10

These laws have real import for real people.

11

And although, I think that counsel was suggesting that

12

Federalism and allowing States to make different laws,

13

if you choose to get married in your State, just don't

14

move to ours.

15

That's the cost of Federalism.

Well, Sergeant Dekoe and his husband,

16

Mr. Kostura, didn't have a choice.

17

Army moved them to Tennessee, and given the location of

18

Army bases in this country, it's almost a certainty that

19

anyone serving in the Army for any length of time will

20

be stationed at some point in a State that would

21

dissolve their marriage as a matter of State law.

22

The United States

I want to get back, Justice Sotomayor, to

23

your comment about categorical and how unprecedented it

24

is, because even in the age of anti­miscegenation laws,

25

the States would give effect, for some purposes,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

interracial marriages such as for purposes of estate,

2

giving out the ­­ the proceeds after a death or ­­ or

3

otherwise.

4

Here, however, the State statutes provide

5

that a marriage shall be given no effect for any reason.

6

Even Jim Obergefell's husband's death certificate will

7

not reflect the fact that he was married or the name of

8

his husband.

9

denying them the dignity of that last fact regarding his

10
11

The State has no legitimate interest for

life.
The real import of the State's argument is,

12

I believe, this:

13

married, they are not, in their view, married for

14

constitutional purposes; that the States can

15

discriminate against these marriages even in ways that

16

the Constitution would not permit the States to

17

disregard the marriages of opposite­sex couples.

18

That even when same­sex couples are
