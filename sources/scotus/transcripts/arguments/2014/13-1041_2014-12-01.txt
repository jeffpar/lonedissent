ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN KNEEDLER

9

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The Administrative Procedure Act expressly

13

exempts interpretative rules from the requirement for

14

notice­and­comment rulemaking, and the APA defines

15

rulemaking as an agency process for formulating, for

16

amending, or repealing a rule.

17

amendment or repeal of an interpretative rule, just like

18

the initial issuance, is exempt from notice­and­comment

19

rulemaking.

20

Doctrine however, once an agency gives a definitive

21

interpretation of a rule, it cannot significantly modify

22

that interpretation without going through

23

notice­and­comment rulemaking.

24
25

Thus, an agency's

Under the D.C. Circuit's Paralyzed Veterans

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there some background

principle that should guide our decision here that in ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

that in a close case, an interpretive rule is preferable

2

to a regulation or vice versa?

3

it would help you in your case if you said that

4

interpretative rules serve an important function and the

5

Paralyzed Veterans's decision is an incentive not to

6

adopt an interpretative interpretation.

Because it seems to me

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

absolutely correct.

9

of whether this is an interpretative rule is not ­­ is

10

Right.

And I think that's

First of all, the ­­ the question

not before the Court.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

But ­­ but it is of critical importance for

14

agencies to be able to issue interpretative rules, and

15

this is reflected in the ­­ in the passage of the APA

16

itself.

17

imposing obstacles to agencies issuing interpretations

18

was designed to encourage them to let the public know

19

what their interpretations of the statutes and rules ­­

20

Correct.
That was conceded below.

The committee reports show that ­­ that the not

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And ­­ and if I'm an

21

agency head and you're an attorney, do you advise me

22

that interpretative rules are often preferred to

23

regulations?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:
depends.

Well, I ­­ I ­­ I think it

And, again, this is a principal purpose of ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

of what the APA did.

2

from going through notice­and­comment rulemaking or

3

other ­­ or other public participation in the case of an

4

interpretative rule.

5

whether to do that.

6

agency might choose to have very specific regulations;

7

in other circumstances, the agency may choose to have

8

interpretations.

9

The APA did not prohibit an agency

It left to the agency the decision
So in some circumstances, the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, things have changed

10

so much mainly because of this Court's interpretations.

11

Was it not the envision by the original APA that

12

substantive rules had to have notice and comment because

13

they would indeed be reviewed by courts on the basis of

14

abuse of discretion?

15

centimeters or 250 centimeters for a particular

16

substantive rule there's no way for a court to say that

17

that's right or wrong.

18

I mean, you know, whether it's 25

Whereas, it was certainly envisioned by the

19

original APA, was it not, that interpretative rules

20

would not be given any deference by the courts, and

21

that's why there didn't have to be notice and comment,

22

because the APA says in so many words that all issues of

23

law shall be decided by the court.

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

But the question of ­­

of deference when an agency ­­ or excuse me, when a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

court is deciding a question of law, that takes into

2

account the agency's interpretation.

3

demonstrated by Chevron because if ­­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is ­­ this is

Yes, yes, yes.

You can say

5

that, but that's not what anybody thought when the APA

6

was passed.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as we point out in a

8

reply brief, it was ­­ it was understood that there

9

would be principles of deference to the ­­ to agency

10

interpretations.

11

interpretations of legislative regulations, Seminole

12

Rock was actually decided before the APA was passed.

13

And so the principle of ­­ of court's giving deference

14

to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation ­­

15

And beyond that, with respect to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about, Mr. Kneedler,

16

this particular kind of interpretation?

17

an unusual situation or in classifying employees for

18

purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act, does ­­ has

19

the agency changed its mind about an initial

20

classification?

21

taken different views on whether loan offices qualify as

22

administrative offices.

23

Standards Act subject to this kind of review and

24

revision by the department?

25

Is ­­ is this

I mean, here we have the agency has

MR. KNEEDLER:

Is ­­ is the Fair Labor

Well, there ­­ there haven't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

been that many instances of ­­ of changes.

2

the purposes of giving an agency the authority to

3

interpret a statute and its regulations is to take into

4

account evolving circumstances.

5

job descriptions, for example, may not even have existed

6

at the time or may have existed in a very different way

7

at ­­ at the time a regulation was adopted or a prior

8

interpretation was given.

9

But one of

The ­­ the ­­ certain

But I do think it's important to recognize

10

that the ­­ that the Fair Labor Standards Act is a

11

situation which Congress has actually contemplated that

12

the agency would give interpretations and might change

13

them.

16

As we point out in our brief ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What was the ­­ was

there a particular basis for the change in this case?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

The ­­ the agency in

17

2010 principally thought that the 2006 interpretation

18

was simply erroneous, because the ­­ the 2006

19

interpretation had relied on Section 203(b), which it ­­

MR. KNEEDLER:

the change.

14

This, of course ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And they hadn't ­­

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

They had addressed the same

18

issues, but ­­ but the Court ­­ or excuse me, the 2006

19

administrative ­­ or excuse me, opinion letter gave what

20

in 2010 the agency thought was an unduly narrow view of

21

what sales activities would consist of.

22

instructive to look at this Court's decision in

23

Christopher.

24

interpretation of another part of this same exemption

25

for outside salesmen.

And it's

Christopher had to do with the

But the Court there recognized

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

that various functions are incidental to sales

2

activities and, even if they don't necessarily encompass

3

the direct face­to­face activity, preparing for that

4

meeting and doing research on that particular customer's

5

view is part of sales activity.

The 2006 opinion letter

6

did not really take that view.

It really just said that

7

face­to­face interaction was the part of sales.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

contrary to prior advice?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Was the 2006 advice

Yes.

There had been opinion

officers were ­­ were not within ­­ were not within the

So is it a second ­­ second

would be easy.

of whether the agency had given fair and considered ­­

13

whether it was a product of fair and considered judgment

today.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

In this case, didn't ­­

interpretation would be entitled to controlling

If it has controlling

"controlling" is just describing the ­­ the consequence

MR. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I ask about that, Mr.

21

Kneedler, because it seems to me that part of what's

22

motivating that Respondent's position and their amici's

23

position, and I'm not sure that this maps on very well

24

to the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, but part of what's

25

motivating it is a sense that agencies more and more are

Alderson Reporting Company

14

using interpretative rules and are using guidance

2

documents to make law and that there is ­­ it's

3

essentially an end run around the notice and comment

provisions.

5

Paralyzed Veterans or not ­­ I mean, what would the

6

asking for it all.

Now, whether that has anything to do with

It's asking for a lot of deference

10

Veterans doctrine, it's asking for a pretty strict

11

demarcation between interpretative and legislative

12

rules.

13
14
15

So what's the solution to the problem that I
think the Respondents are basically identifying?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Okay.

And that ­­ my answer

16

to that question has a number of parts.

17

in this specific statute Congress has given a pretty

18

good answer, which is 29 U.S.C., the Portal­to­Portal

19

Act provision 259, which says that a party cannot be

20

held liable for good faith reliance on an interpretation

21

issued by the agency, and that applies whether or not

22

the statute expressly says that has been amended or

23

rescinded.

24

contemplates that there will be changes in ­­

25

First of all,

So the Portal­to­Portal Act specifically

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I notice you make a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

point of that on page 4 of your brief, but ­­ I don't

2

wish to interrupt Justice Kagan's line of questioning ­­

3

but it seems to me that we have to assume that there

4

will be many other cases in which there's no safe harbor

5

provision, and you have the retroactivity.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

No.

That ­­ that's

7

absolutely right, but here there is a safe harbor

8

provision.

9
10
11

Congress addressed this in ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you ­­ you don't ask

us to confine our reasoning to that kind of case.
MR. KNEEDLER:

And so the ­­ with

With respect to the question of deference, I

in the way deference might play into a change in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose ­­ suppose a

6

court had given, quote, "controlling deference" to the

7

2006 rule.

8
9

Does that make any difference?

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I think by analogy to

Brand X, if the ­­ if the agency gives a different

10

interpretation to the regulation, that change should be

11

given effect by a reviewing court.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you go back to

13

Justice ­­ answering Justice Kagan?

14

the fundamental concern, which is that agencies are

15

bypassing the notice and public comment by using

16

interpretative rules when they should be using

17

legislative rules?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's why I asked you to define when one has to

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the ­­ the D.C.

Alderson Reporting Company

17
1

Circuit's decision in American Mining Congress has been

2

given a lot of attention as dividing between what's an

3

interpretative rule and what's a ­­ what's a regulation.

4

And the ­­ I think the principal guide there is whether

5

in the absence of the rule, would there be a standard to

6

which the regulative party could be held, and here there

7

unquestionably is.

8

and the ­­ and the regulation itself dealing with the

9

exemption, which Congress has expressly authorized the

The Fair Labor Standards Act applies

10

Secretary to define, identifies who is ­­ who is an

11

administrative employee by ­­ by several factors.

12

here there's ­­ this interpretative regulation is by no

13

means necessary to establish a basic rule of ­­ of

14

liability.

So

15

Now, there could be situations that ­­ that,

16

again, were identified in American Mining Congress and,

17

frankly, in this Court's decision in Gonzales v. Oregon.

18

If the agency issues a regulation that does nothing more

19

than just parrot the statute, then the agency hasn't

20

really accomplished anything by its ­­ by its regulation

21

and its ­­ and its interpretative rule would not get ­­

22

would not get deference.

23

But if the agency has actually given

24

content, even if necessarily in somewhat general terms,

25

then that is satisfactory.

And under the Fair Labor

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why ­­ why should there be

a difference.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Pardon me?
Why should there be a

21

difference between the two, between the treatment of

22

substantive rules and interpretative rules?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as I said, substantive

24

rules or legislative rules themselves define ­­ have the

25

force and effect of law.

They themselves define duties

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

and obligations.

2

the Attorney General's Manual on the APA, which this

3

Court has repeated in Chrysler, is designed to inform

4

the public of the agency's view of the statutes and

5

rules ­­

6

Interpretative rules ­­ and this is in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, nonsense.

So long ­­

7

whether it's an interpretative rule or a substantive

8

rule, it is reviewed by a court with deference, right?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you want us to give the

same deference to both.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Yes.

So what the court says

14

about, in its substantive rule, is just as much or no

15

less law than what a court says in its interpretative

16

rule.

17

the very strange things about this case is that I

comes to Auer deference, if the interpretation has been

2

unstable over time and if the interpretation has created

3

a kind of unfair surprise for private parties, that

4

those interpretations do not get Auer deference.

5

So the very kinds of interpretations that

we're talking about here, which is revised and amended

interpretations, they don't get Auer deference in the

8

first place.

point.

14

there's another way to look at this and that has to do

15

with the giving deference ­­ whether deference should be

given to the agency's new interpretation with respect to

17

transactions that ­­ that occurred before.

18

that's a question of retroactivity, because one ­­ one

19

could say if the agency gives a new interpretation to an

20

existing legislative rule, that to give deference to

21

that interpretation retrospectively is, in effect, to

22

apply the regulation as so interpreted retroactively and

23

not give it effect.

And if I could explain.

There's another way ­­

That's ­­

But I don't think ­­ the fact that there's a

Thank you.
Ms. Ho.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MS. HO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin with Justice Sotomayor's

22

question about the dividing line between interpretative

23

rules and legislative rules in the context of what my

24

friend Mr. Kneedler has said about retroactivity.

25

I think when you consider ­­ the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26

says, and it's recognized in the past, that the 2010 AI,

2

the agency action that is at issue here, the government

3

has said it was such a substantive change in the law

4

that it could not be applied retroactively.

5

fundamentally inconsistent with any notion of an

6

interpretive rule ­­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That is

Ms. Ho, I think that this

8

entire case has been litigated with everybody accepting

9

that this was an interpretative rule.

Now, maybe that

10

was wrong.

11

instance and said, really, we think this is a

12

legislative rule and so it had to go through notice and

13

comment.

14

happened in this case happened on the view that this was

15

an interpretative rule and the question is what followed

16

from that classification.

17

Maybe you should have come in in the first

But you didn't do that.

MS. HO:

Everything that

Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I

18

disagree with that ­­ with that description.

19

explain on page 46 of the red brief, what we said below

20

was that the 2010 AI was an interpretation.

21

interpretation is not dispositive of whether it's a

22

legislative or interpretative rule.

23

importantly, Justice Kagan, the D.C. Circuit in its

24

decision under review gave no indication, made no

25

suggestion that what it was, in fact, doing was

it cited the APA that the AI 2010 was a de facto

4

amendment.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

It held and

But to the contrary,

6

Ms. Ho, I mean, the entire Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine

7

is about when interpretative rules get notice and

8

comment, have to get notice and comment, if ever.

9

not about the division line between interpretative rules

It's

10

and legislative rules.

11

citing Paralyzed Veterans, it's on the assumption that

12

what we're talking about is an interpretative rule.

13

MS. HO:

So when the D.C. Circuit starts

Again, Your Honor, I would

14

respectfully disagree with that.

15

dispute that there is loose language in dicta and that

16

the D.C. Circuit has not been entirely clear about it.

17

But I think ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I don't ­­ I don't

It's not just loose

19

language.

20

they deal with two arguments.

21

what's become known as the Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine

22

and then they say, oh, you know, there's another

23

argument in the case, which is that this isn't an

24

interpretative rule at all.

25

If you go back to Paralyzed Veterans itself,

MS. HO:

The first argument is

Your Honor, I think the way that I

would understand both Paralyzed Veterans and the cases

since it, is Paralyzed Veterans it looked at one argument

3

for why what it had before it was interpretative in name

4

only.

5

isn't an interpretable ­­ it is a de facto amendment.

6

And a de facto amendment ­­

7

And it said the best argument here is that this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why wouldn't the 2006

8

interpretation, which you say should have stuck, why if

9

this ­­ if it's ­­ if it's legislative, if it's

10

substantive, then the 2006 interpretation was equally

11

defective because there was no notice and comment for

12

the 2006.

13

rule as not interpretative, I don't see how you can say,

14

oh, but the 2006 rule was interpretative.

15

since there were the earlier rulings the other way.

16

What was it, the 2001 and ­­ so it seems to me that you

17

want it to be interpretative when it favors you and you

18

want it to be not interpretative ­­ you want the 2006 to

19

be interpretative because you didn't go through notice

20

21

MS. HO:

If you are trying to characterize the 2010

Your Honor, I think ­­ I think

what ­­ the status of 2006 opinion, which is not before

think you could say wipe it all out, start over, but I

one difference that would tie back to Your Honor's

question in this case, which has to do with the

Paralyzed Veterans doctrine.

10

MS. HO:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
And I guess what I would

like for you to do is simply to try to explain that

doctrine to me, and on the view that is a doctrine about

14

interpretative rules and what it says is that there are

15

occasions when interpretative rules must be done through

initial interpretation as to the revised interpretation.

In other words, if you really want to say an

interpretation somehow changes the legislative

13

interpretation takes place, doesn't it?

14

I do not think that is the fairest reading of what ­­

5

applied it.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Ho, I think that

7

you've just said that Paralyzed Veterans is wrong then,

8

because, I mean, the D.C. Circuit has two lines of

9

precedent.

One line of precedent is all about how to

10

distinguish between legislative and interpretative

11

rules, and I forget what the principal case is but there

12

is a four­part test, and that's what it uses.

13

Paralyzed Veterans it uses for a different purpose

14

altogether, which is that when it's decided that something

15

is an interpretative rule, there is still another question

16

to be asked which is whether that interpretative rule

17

revises a ­­ a previously stable interpretation.

variation on that and saying that you can have an

MS. HO:

Yes, Your Honor, and I ­­ I think

15

Paralyzed Veterans is best understood as recognizing a

16

variation on that.

17

precisely why in Paralyzed Veterans the Court went on to

18

consider whether the rule may be legislative on any

19

other ­­ any other number of ­­ of prongs.

20

And I think that's why ­­ that's

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then, I mean, go back to

21

what Justice Scalia asked you, which is that if you drop

22

this kind of reinterpretation of Paralyzed Veterans and

23

you assume that what we are dealing with here is an

24

interpretative rule, then you don't think notice and

The question in this case is whether

was a ­­ a significant change in the interpretation of

therefore, it should not be given ­­

22

should not be applied retroactively to it, which we

think is an important safeguard that this Court could

look to in terms of Auer deference, not giving Auer

deference to the application of a regulation to prior

I think when ­­ if you read the whole

passage, that passage in the brief was in

4

contradistinction to a situation where an interpretative

5

rule is simply clarifying or interpreting for the first

6

time something that was not clear in the regulation.

7

And in that situation, there's no problem of ­­ of

retroactivity because the agency is interpreting the

regulation as it always ­­ as it always meant.
