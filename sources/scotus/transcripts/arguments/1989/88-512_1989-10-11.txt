ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN, ESQ.

We'll hear argument first this

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether an accused

11

may be cross-examined with the statement taken subsequent to

12

the assertion of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel as that

13

right has been construed in Michigan v. Jackson.

14

I wish to present for the Court's consideration this

15

morning two principal points.

16

evidence for impeachment purposes is an inappropriate remedy

17

for violation of a prophylactic rule, and that Jackson is such

18

a rule.

19

exclusion of evidence for impeachment purposes is also

20

inappropriate for violation of the Sixth Amendment as it

21

relates to custodial interrogation.

22

The first is that exclusion of

But, secondly, and perhaps more fundamentally, that

The facts, very briefly put, in this case are these.

The

23

victim in this case testified that respondent raped and beat

24

her, causing three fractures to her left eye socket.

25

Respondent, on the other hand, testified that the episode was

essentially an agreement to exchange sex for cocaine gone

wrong, and that the blows that he struck were in

3

self-defense.The prosecutor questioned respondent about a

4

statement that he had made after arraignment and assertion of

5

the right to counsel.

6

respondent told the police officer that he wished to make

7

another statement.

8

9

That statement came to be taken when

But he then also said that he didn't know whether or not
he should talk to his attorney.

The officer stated that that

10

would not be necessary, as his attorney would be supplied a

11

copy of any statement that he might make.
The assistant prosecutor stated that it was because of

12

13

this colloquy between respondent and the attorney that she did

14

not believe that the statement was admissible in the case in

15

chief.

16

impeachment purposes, arguing that it was not involuntary.

However, she did argue that it was admissible for

QUESTION:

20

Mr. Baughman.
Yes.

I guess you concede that there is a Sixth

Amendment violation here.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

21

Yes.

The prosecutor at trial conceded

22

that the colloquy between the respondent and the police

23

officer rendered the statement involuntary -- I mean,

24

inadmissible in the case in chief, and we are not contesting

25

that.

1

QUESTION:

When did the Sixth Amendment violation occur?

2

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I would say that it occurred when the

3

police officer continued to question respondent after the

4

colloquy about whether or not he should talk to his attorney.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

Is the admission of the statements at trial

itself a Sixth Amendment violation or not?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well -- yes.

The Sixth Amendment was not

8

violated, I would say, by the taking of the statement.

QUESTION:

You don't think there's a violation even

though he didn't use it?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I would say if -- if nothing was

used at trial, the issue wouldn't be presented as -QUESTION:

I thought you had told me the violation

occurred when the statements were taken.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

That is correct.

The officer should have

20

and we are not raising it here, trying to argue that that --

QUESTION:

At least, we are not

We did not. raise it in the trial court

Well, it makes a difference analytically to

22

know whether it is a violation of the Sixth Amendment when the

23

testimony is offered at trial, or whether it's a violation of

24

some prophylactic rule designed to protect Sixth Amendment

25

rights.

Which is it?

1

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, the right to counsel with regard to

2

custodial interrogation, it seems to me, can only ripen, if I

3

can put it that way, when some evidence taken from the accused

4

is offered in court.

5

If the prosecutor had not used this statement in any way,

6

then I would say that the Sixth Amendment right wasn't

7

violated, only a prophylactic rule to protect that right would

8

have been violated by the questioning.

QUESTION:

11

was violated when the questions were asked.

12

question of what's the remedy for that violation.

13

Well, that's a rather curious position to
I would have thought that the Sixth Amendment

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Then it becomes a

Well, either the Sixth Amendment or a

14

prophylactic rule would be violated when the questions were

15

asked, I suspect.

16

Sixth Amendment is a trial right or a preparation for trial

17

right, and if counsel is denied, as in Powell, an adequate

18

time to prepare, or denied at trial, as in Gideon, you have a

19

violation of the Sixth Amendment itself.

20

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that in its essence the

Suppose the district attorney himself or

21

herself had conducted the questioning after appointment of

22

counsel and without a waiver.

23

violation of the Sixth Amendment?

Would that have been

line of questioning.

Amendment violation unless there is some evidence introduced,

5

it would seem to me that there would be many reasons why

6

prosecutors would want to go down and talk to the people

7

they're going to put on trial.

8

9

MR. BAUGHMAN:

You may

And if you say there is no Sixth

Well, again, I struggle with the question

because it seemed to me that the Sixth Amendment was in

10

essence a trial right.

11

in the Fifth Amendment, if I could compare for just a moment,

12

where an individual could even be coerced into giving a

13

statement, but his Fifth Amendment right wouldn't be violated

14

until the evidence is offered because his right is not to be

15

compelled to be a witness against himself.

16
17

QUESTION:

But the language of the Fifth Amendment is

different, of course.

18

MR. BAUGHMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

And, for example, I can see situations

That's correct.

It suggests that result.

That's not the

language of the Sixth Amendment.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, the Sixth Amendment to me does not

22

suggest on its face any necessary role for counsel at

23

interrogation prior to the attachment of the right.

24
25

In the first portion of my brief I attempted to argue or
to make the point that there is at least some theoretical

1

question as to the underpinning of the entire doctrine of

2

counsel even having a role at this stage.

3

argue that point today, but all I wish to suggest there is

4

that there is an argument to be made that perhaps this court

5

has taken the doctrine of the right to counsel at impeachment

6

as far as it ought to go so that it should not extend it to

7

impeachment use.

8

9

I'm not planning to

What I am suggesting here with the first portion of my
argument as to the prophylactic rule is simply that Jackson is

10

a prophylactic rule in terms of guarding the Sixth Amendment

11

right to counsel, and that there hasn't been a finding in this

12

case by any court that the respondent didn't otherwise validly

13

waive his right to counsel.

14

this case.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

The issue was never litigated in

And the Michigan Court of Appeals relied on

Jackson for its holding?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Yes, it did.

On appeal what the Michigan

18

Court of Appeals stated was that the — and I quote -- that

19

the statement was made in violation of defendant's Sixth

20

Amendment right to counsel, see, e.g., Michigan v. Jackson.

21

statement so acquired may not be used for any purpose,

22

including impeachment.

of appeals analysis in this case.

there had been an otherwise valid waiver of the right to

counsel, and there was no need for it to do so because in

2

Jackson this Court had held that any waiver of the right to

3

counsel occurring after its assertion and occurring at

4

police-initiated interrogation is simply invalid.

5

need for further inquiry.

6

There is no

That case, Michigan v. Jackson, was premised on Edwards

7

v. Arizona and imported directly the Edwards rule that when an

8

accused asserts his Miranda counsel right to cut off

9

questioning, any waiver occurring subsequently at

10

police-initiated interrogation is simply invalid without any

11

further inquiry into the manner in which that waiver might

12

have occurred.

13

QUESTION:

But I would -Mr. Baughman, would you just -- I was trying

14

to remember this sequence.

15

-- this particular questioning was -- was it after he'd been

16

both charged and after a lawyer had been appointed to

17

represent —

18

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Yes.

This was not only after he'd been

This was after arraignment and

19

assertion of the right to counsel by a claim of indigency and

20

the appointment of counsel.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

So the prosecutor and the police knew he was

represented and he had a lawyer that they could contact?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I'm sure the police were undoubtedly aware

24

of that.

25

he wanted to talk to.

I can't say this individual officer was that he said
But that's -- when he said,

"But I

1

don't know if I should talk to my lawyer," that pretty well

2

told them, I think.

3

QUESTION:

Do you think the case would be any different

4

-- I'm just thinking of Justice Kennedy's question -- if the

5

questioning had been by the prosecutor?

6

MR. BAUGHMAN:

As to the Sixth Amendment I don't think it

7

would make a difference, but I think we'd be into a different

8

question in the State of Michigan as to the application of the

9

ethical standards.

10

QUESTION:

It would be clearly unethical, wouldn't it?

11

MR. BAUGHMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

an agent to do it?

14

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Yes, it would.

It's not unethical for the prosecutor to use
Is that right?
Well, if the prosecutor used an agent,

15

that is, told the police officer to go talk to him, I think

16

that would also be unethical.

But the prosecutor did not tell this officer to talk to
the individual.

In fact, he —

MR. BAUGHMAN:

QUESTION:

Do you think --- did not know this was going on.

Do you think the case would be different if

23

the prosecutor had told the police officer to go ahead and see

24

what you can find out?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Under the cannons I think definitely it

QUESTION:

How about constitutionally?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

No, I don't think it would be different
But I think we would not be here because of

5

the cannons and the way Michigan has construed those.

QUESTION:

But going back again to the constitutional

question, you think it would not be a constitutional violation

8

for the prosecutor himself or herself to go ahead and question

9

the —
MR. BAUGHMAN:

10
11

I don't think the constitutional question

would turn on who does the asking.
QUESTION:

12

I don't understand why you say that the case

13

wouldn't be here because of the violation of the cannons.

14

we exclude evidence because of violation of the cannons now?

15

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, no,

Do

I think if the Michigan Supreme

16

Court or Court of Appeals had said this case is reversed

17

because we find as a matter of state law that a violation of

18

the cannons precludes use of the evidence for any purpose,

19

then I think the case would have been decided on a state law

20

basis and we wouldn't have a federal ground to go on.

1

constitutional guarantee and referred to the rule in Edwards

2

as a prophylactic rule.

3

established a bright-line rule to safeguard preexisting

4

rights, not a new substantive requirement.

5

The court stated that Edwards

So, is it possible to violate a protective rule to, as it

6

were, pierce the protective umbrella, without violating the

7

underlying constitutional principle that the protective rule

8

or umbrella was designed to protect?

9

has answered that question in the affirmative on more than one

10
11

And I think this Court

occasion.
For example, in Miranda this Court has held time and

12

again that the Miranda warnings themselves are not

13

constitutional rights but are prophylactic rules designed to

14

protect the underlying constitutional right, that of a

15

compelled self-incrimination.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Counsel, if you take the position that

17

the violation of the Sixth Amendment occurs at the time the

18

evidence is offered at trial, then it seems to me very

19

difficult to argue that it's only a prophylactic rule.

20

you're dealing with the violation itself.

Then

21

If you took the position that the violation occurred when

22

the questioning occurred, then I can understand that you could

23

have a prophylactic rule that says you won't use it at trial.

24

But I find your argument hard to follow.

25

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I think your Honor is correct, and I see

1

your point.

I'm tending to confuse the Sixth and the Fifth

2

Amendments.

I think that if error occurred in the

3

constitutional sense, whether it be a prophylactic rule or the

4

underlying right, it would have to occur at questioning.

5

The admission of the evidence is the question of whether

6

or not any remedy springs or not.

7

remedy springs.

8

So, I think your Honor is correct.

9

QUESTION:

If it's not admitted, no

If it is, then there is a litigable point.

But, Counsel, is it not possible that there is

10

a constitutional violation at both times?

11

constitutional violation to engage in this kind of questioning

12

when the man is represented by counsel, and (b) it's a

13

constitutional violation to introduce it at trial.

You seemed to think the second was the case just very

15

naturally.

with one another.

17

That (a) it's a

I don't think they are necessarily inconsistent

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I think, for example, it's

18

conceivable that the individual could be questioned and then

19

no prosecution brought or the case dropped.

20

QUESTION:

I concede that --

Not after -- after he's been indicted, do you

21

think a police officer can come back and say, I've just asked

22

him some questions and he says he's innocent so we'll drop the

No, I don't think so.

It's conceivable that it

6

questions -- I think she's correct that I couldn't say that

occurred previously.

9

that one would litigate.

10

QUESTION:

It simply didn't ripen into anything

It's also true that if a violation -- if you

11

acknowledge a violation occurred at that time, then it's quite

12

different from the Miranda situation in which the warning is

13

given in order to avoid a violation.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I — but I'm not conceding that what

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Michigan v. Jackson states that if the

simply may not initiate any questioning with him unless he

transposed from the Fifth Amendment into the Sixth Amendment.
The rule of Edwards is that if the individual exercises

It's the same rule from the Fifth into

And this Court has said in the Edwards context that

MR. BAUGHMAN:

QUESTION:

That's -- that's correct.

But here you're saying a constitutional

MR. BAUGHMAN:

answer to Justice O'Connor which was that a constitutional

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, let me try to make it clear.

The

22

violation that occurred in this case occurred at the time of

But I'm not conceding that that was a violation of the Sixth

violated.

3

All that was decided was that Jackson was

And what I'm arguing to this Court today in the first

4

portion of my argument is that Jackson establishes a

5

prophylactic rule to protect waivers of counsel so that if an

6

individual has asserted his right to counsel, you just can't

7

question him at all.

8
9

But I think that it is certainly conceivable and possible
that if the police do initiate interrogation after the

10

assertion of the right to counsel and we examined all the

11

surrounding facts, that one could say as a matter of actual

12

fact that a voluntary and intelligent and knowing waiver of

13

the right to counsel has occurred.

14

If that can occur, if it is possible to actually

15

voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waive the right to

16

counsel, when the police initiate the interrogation, then the

17

That's correct.

The Michigan Court of

They forgave the failure to object;

they found a Jackson violation and said that a Jackson

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I don't know if that's exactly what

this Court has done because, again, if you look to the Fifth

This Court could have said in Massiah or Brewer, or other

the linchpin of the Fifth Amendment is not reliability, it's

coercion.

Justice Stewart put it, in that case the court was dealing

with the constitutional privilege in its most pristine form.

So, any coerce statements by a governmental agent

That's what the Fifth Amendment is for.

It's to exclude

7

an evidence from evidence a class of testimonial evidence,

compelled statements.

9

That's why it exists.

But with the Fourth Amendment, as contrasted to the

10

Fifth, this Court has reached a different result.

This Court

11

has held that when that right is violated, rather than a

12

prophylactic rule designed to protect it -- and I'm unaware of

13

any, frankly -- that use of evidence for impeachment purposes

14

illegally seized under the Fourth Amendment is permissible.

to counteract what appears to be perjury at the trial.

10

MR. MORGAN:

Well, in this record it does not appear to

11

be perjury.

12

respondent's position in essence is that just as we do not

permit a compelled involuntary statement, as in Portash, to be

used for impeachment, we should not permit, in the name of

truth-seeking, a statement taken in clear violation of the .

both -- both come within the rule that use -- the government

or the state cannot use that product to impeach the defendant

because it would violate the Fifth Amendment right itself.

part of the reasoning there has been that the coerced

confession is deemed presumptively unreliable?

MR. MORGAN:

That's correct.
And certainly that wouldn't be true in this

case.

13

here would not lead to any presumption of unreliability.

14

The circumstances attending the defendant's statement

I don't know if it would lead to a

presumption of unreliability, but the record in this case

implicates or raises a concern for unreliability.

MR. MORGAN:

It's your position, as I

That's my position.
That's your position?
And if the respondent says, -Yeah.
-- I want to confess, he can go to confess

12

in open court where there is an exacting standard concerning

13

that waiver, an exacting standard concerning all of the

14

rights.

15

And that's in compliance with rule of --

QUESTION:

His will by the Sixth Amendment has just maybe

16

been taken over and given to the lawyer.

to my minister; I've decided the decent thing to do is to

confess.

do this.

20

He says, I've talked

I'm sorry, your lawyer has your will now, you can't

MR. MORGAN:

Well, if that's his will, his will will

21

overbear the lawyer certainly.

wrong that the state says, no, you've already told us that you

Absolutely.

But you have an attorney and

we're going to provide your attorney notice.

of the attorney, just as Faretta will won out and he was

QUESTION:

And since you

Counsel, in Michigan I take it the rule is

7

that it's unethical for defense counsel to knowingly introduce

8

a line of perjured testimony?

9
10

MR. MORGAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
But what would happen if the police, after the

11

appointment of counsel, took a statement and gave it to the

12

counsel and it was quite clear from the statement, because it

13

linked up with other evidence, that the client's original

14

story he told to the police was perjured testimony?

15
16
17
18
19

What would the client's -- what would the attorney's
obligation be in that regard?
MR. MORGAN:

I think then we've implicated the court's

ruling in Nicks v. Whiteside.
QUESTION:

In other words, you would -- the defense

20

counsel would have the obligation to take into consideration

21

the statement?

22

23

MR. MORGAN:

If it is clear, certainly, that the client

intends to perjure himself?

QUESTION:

25

MR. MORGAN:

Yes.
I believe so.

You're assuming the most difficult case, and

that is in an absolutely clear, beyond contradiction -QUESTION:

MR. MORGAN:

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- confession.
Well, isn't the answer to that that if

everybody plays according to the rules and they show the

statement to the lawyer, the lawyer will not put on the false

testimony?

15

MR. MORGAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

I believe so.
So that if they carried out your suggestion,

the problem would be easily solved?

18

MR. MORGAN:

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

In fact --

Instead of waiting in the bushes and letting

20

him put it in and get caught in the trap, their duty is to

21

show it to the lawyer who then has the duty not to introduce

22

the false testimony.
