ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. NEIMAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. NEIMAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
During a lawful inventory search of a locked —

12

a locked suitcase was opened for inventory.

13

Supreme Court suppressed the evidence found therein,

14

finding that the Fourth Amendment requires that the scope

15

of an inventory to be explicitly stated.

16

this Court to hold than an inventory search encompasses

17

the entire contents of the vehicle, including closed

18

containers.

19

the purposes of Opperman and, as we affirm, in Bertine.

20

That is to satisfy and protect the property of the

21

individual for safekeeping, and the police from false

22

claims of — and due to loss of property.

23

The Florida

Florida asked

Such a rule of law will be incontinent with

These scope of an inventory in and of itself

24

states that you are to catalogue the doc, the documents

25

and the property found within the car.

It is solely to

1
2

areas where valuable personal property would attach.
In the case before the Court, the Florida

3

Supreme Court found that there was a good faith

4

impoundment, and that the inventory of the interior of the

5

car, as well as the inventory of the trunk, was lawful.

6

What the Florida Supreme Court found then, that the

7

opening of the — the prying open of the locked suitcase

8

to inventory that, was unlawful and violative of the

9

principles announced in Bertine, because it held that

10

Bertine required standardized procedures listing the exact

11

nature and scope of an inventory search.

12

The state position in front of this Court is

13

that Bertine does not require such a detailed listing,

14

just that there be procedures, whether written or oral,

15

that all inventory — all impounded cars are inventoried.

16

By requiring that all impounded cars are inventoried, this

17

will take away the evidentiary discretion that this Court

18

has so declared unconstitutional in its previous cases.

19

The evidentiary discretion would be taken away

20

because every car would then be subject to inventory.

21

inventory would then be —

QUESTION:

May I ask, in this case, where is the

inventory in the record?

MR. NEIMAND:

QUESTION:

Is it in the record?
The actual inventory list?

No, it's not, Your Honor.

The reason

1

it is not in the record is because of the history of this

2

case.

3

because it — the defendant was not given a reasonable

4

opportunity to do something other than have the car

5

impounded, in other words, to have someone drive it away

6

or to leave it on the street.

8

Florida is a Fourth Amendment state.

QUESTION:

But they did, they did make an

inventory sheet?

11

MR. NEIMAND:

12

QUESTION:

13

16
17
18

An inventory does in fact exist.

And — but you didn't put it in the

record?

14
15

By our

state constitution we have adopted —

9
10

The inventory initially was declared improper

MR. NEIMAND:

It was never in the record, no,

sir.
QUESTION:

So we don't know whether they

inventoried the contents of the suitcase or not.
MR. NEIMAND:

We do not know if it is on the

19

inventory sheet, no.

We do not.

And it was never brought

20

out below because that was never at issue below.

21

original issue below was that it was an improper

22

impoundment, in the lower appellate court.

23

Supreme Court, this Court had then issued the Bertine

24

opinion, which then said there need not be a reasonable

25

alternative to impoundment in order to make the inventory

The defendant didn't rely on the,

theory was a consent theory.

trial court argue that the search of the suitcase was

improper?
MR. NEIMAND:

he explicitly raised that issue, at this point in time.
QUESTION:

19

At all — I really don't recall if

I am just wondering how the case got

here.

20

MR. NEIMAND:

It — I, that is how I will

21

explain how it got here, because when — it was strictly

22

an order by the trial court saying the motion to suppress

23

is denied.

24

well, I believe, the opening of the suitcase was improper.

MR. NEIMAND:

QUESTION:

MR. NEIMAND:

I believe that he took the

position that it was an improper inventory search.
QUESTION:

9

What position did the — did the

defendant take?

6

7

That is right, Your Honor.

And yet, and in defending that claim,

the state did not put in the inventory.
MR. NEIMAND:

10

No, because the state relied

11

strictly on the consent theory, and the court below, the

12

trial court below did not give any factual findings in his

13

order.

14

lower appellate court, the appellate court found that the

15

consent was too broad, and they, on its own said there was

16

no probable cause.

17

He simply said denied.

When it went up to the

And then on the inventory aspect, which the

18

state brought up at that point in time to try and defend,

19

indicated that under this Court's decision in Opperman and

20

our state court's decisions, then that was an improper

21

impoundment.

22

Supreme Court that the actual issue of inventory was

23

brought up, because at that point in time this Court's

24

decision in Bertine had changed the law requiring a

25

reasonable alternative toward impoundment.

It was only until it got to the Florida

And at that

point in time the Florida Supreme Court recognized that

2

that now bound it in its determination, and found that we

did not have to give a reasonable alternative.

good faith impoundment based upon a DUI arrest.

5

at that point in time the court got involved in the

6

inventory question.

It was a
And that

7

It went up from the lower appellate court to the

8

higher appellate court on a certified question within — a

9

certified conflict rather, within Florida, on two — two

10

separate — decisions out of two separate circuits, on the

11

scope of the consent search, based upon this decision —

12

this Court's decision in United States v. Ross.

13

was pending because the Florida Supreme Court may, in

14

exercising its discretionary jurisdiction, heard the case

15

on the conflict, they also reached the other matters that

16

were before the court, and that was the impoundment and

17

the inventory.
QUESTION:

21

While it

Mr. Neimand, when did the search

occur?
MR. NEIMAND:

The inventory search occurred

after the arrest, after the car was towed —

22

QUESTION:

What year and what month?

23

MR. NEIMAND:

It was — the search occurred in

24

1985, prior to this Court's opinion in Bertine, right

25

around the Opperman era.

inventory search?

Under this — under this Court's

ruling?
QUESTION:

No, no, no, no.

As a matter of local

law and procedure.
MR. NEIMAND:

Under the procedure as the officer

10

stated, he was working under standard operating procedure

11

that he was to inventory a car upon impoundment from the

12

hood to the trunk.

QUESTION:

That is what he had testified to.
What does the testimony show the

policy was with regard to opening locked containers?
MR. NEIMAND:

The — there was no exact

16

testimony on that point.

Once again, the reason there was

17

no exact testimony on that point is because that was not

at issue at the trial court level.

This is a unique area

open a locked container, or not, in your view?
' MR. NEIMAND:

In the state's view, there is no

discretion, because an inventory search within operating

4

procedures say you must inventory the vehicle.

5

includes closed containers anywhere where personal

6

valuable property might be located.

7

QUESTION:

That

Well, the concern, of course, is to

8

avoid pretextual searches for evidence.

9

some testimony that the officer conducting the search

Here there was

10

suspected there had to be marijuana in the car, and the

11

opening of the suitcase was in an effort to locate it.

12

MR. NEIMAND:

That is the testimony, Your Honor.

13

However, the inventory was done in good faith.

14

article that he looked in was an article where personal

15

property was, or could have been, located.

16

reasonableness of the search should not depend upon the

subjective motivation of the officer, but on the item that

is in fact searched.

that would be unreasonable, and that would definitely show

that there was other motives.

reasonableness of the search.

1

had opened the hood to check to make sure the battery was

2

there, and upon closing the hood a piece of personal

3

property, a gun or something else, came out from under the

4

hood upon closing it down, would it then be reasonable to

5

look further into the hood of the car to determine if

6

there was other personal property involved.

7

is what we have to look at to determine whether or not it

8

is a reasonable search, whether the motivation involved is

9

subjective or whether it is a reasonable standard.

10

J

I think that

I believe that the cases have always held that

11

there always might be a possibility that subjective

12

motivation will come into play, that there will be a dual

13

purpose that evidence of criminal activity might be

14

uncovered during the search.

But the question really is,

15

is if it is a proper inventory search to begin with, does

16

the ultimate finding of contraband invalidate the

17

propriety, the original propriety of the inventory search.

13

The state, obviously, suggests that it does not, as long

19

as the state meets the standards that are required by this

20

Court.
QUESTION:

21

Well, now, if the officer listed on

22

the inventory a locked suitcase, would the officer be in

23

violation of the applicable state inventory policy,

24

subject to discipline because he listed it that way on the

25

inventory?

MR. NEIMAND:

1

I would suggest that he would be.

2

I would suggest a better policy would be to open that

3

suitcase, even if it means breaking that suitcase, to list

4

the property, and then put it in the property room.

5

would be far much of a less of a burden upon the state in

6

terms of cost and energy to pay for a $200 suitcase, than

7

to put a locked suitcase in a property room, and when it's

8

still in police custody something happens in that large

9

property room and we return to him an open suitcase with

10

It

contents totally missing.
QUESTION:

11

That sounds like a very good rule,

12

but how do we know that was the rule that indeed was in

13

force here?

MR. NEIMAND:

Well, we don't know.

And I, the

state is —

QUESTION:

17

Well, then, we can't possibly affirm

MR. NEIMAND:

18

Well, the state, what the state is

19

seeking is a reversal with a remand.

20

proper rule of law to be followed so that this can then be

22

findings of fact.

doctrine, the only purpose in the inventory doctrine is

5

the protection of the property, personal valuable

property.

7

regardless of whether they would in fact or could in fact

8

contain personal property, would be too broad in scope

9

under the inventory search doctrine.

To say you have to open up all containers,

What the state is

10

saying is that it is to be those containers that

11

reasonably could contain personal property.

12

containers would become just a general exploratory search,

because they would not fit under the criteria of inventory

searches.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Neimand, did the Supreme Court of

16

Florida in its opinion spend any time describing what the

17

rule was in this police department for inventory searches?

18

“N

Well, I think under the inventory

MR. NEIMAND:

Yes, they did.

It was to

19

inventory all articles and property in the vehicle.

And

20

that is in the joint appendix as well as in the opinion

21

itself.

22

said, that was no different than those standards that were

23

upheld by this Court in Bertine, which allowed going into

closed containers, because in that case the standard said

QUESTION:

3

Well, do you question the accuracy of

the description in the opinion of the Supreme Court of

5

Florida of the department's inventory search policy?
MR. NEIMAND:

6

Well, the accuracy of the

documentation I, we do not question.

interpretation, obviously, we do in fact question.
QUESTION:

The accuracy of the

But, the court decided that the

10

instructions were so and so, but they weren't detailed

11

enough.

They should have expressly mentioned —

QUESTION:

Well, that — exactly.

So that's — they're saying that's

what, that's what this Court's opinions require.

didn't really expressly deal with it.

MR. NEIMAND:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. NEIMAND:

And that

And that is why we are here —

Exactly.
-— because obviously the state is

20

saying that that is not what this Court has meant by

21

Bertine standard procedures, and the standard procedures

22

that was meant for Bertine simply was that an inventory

23

must occur on all impounded vehicles.

24

that inventory would go to all articles where valuable

25

personal property might be located.

Well then is it not reasonable to

assume that any closed container contains something?
MR. NEIMAND:

It is most reasonable to assume

that, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

So that every closed container would

reasonably be thought to contain some personal property.

15

MR. NEIMAND:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So that would mean that — does that

17

mean that the officer has discretion in every case to open

your view in Florida, to open or not to open the

2

container?

3
4

MR. NEIMAND:

No, he must open it to inventory

it.

5

QUESTION:

But if you say that, how do you

6

reconcile that with the court's statement that the Florida

7

Highway Patrol "operates under no mandatory standardized

8

policy regarding closed containers"?

9

is such a policy, and it is to open all containers.
MR. NEIMAND:

10
11

That is right.

You are saying there

We are saying that

because --

QUESTION:

Should we take your word or the

13

court's word on this?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. NEIMAND:

Well, I think what we — what the

16

problem we have here is that the testimony of the officer

17

was never fleshed out.

18

seeking is a rule of law to be properly applied upon a

19

remand, so that the Florida courts could then determine

20

whether or not that policy did in fact exist.
QUESTION:

21

That is why what the state is

Well, the Florida court apparently

was referring to the Highway Patrol Policy Manual, Chapter

MR. NEIMAND:

5

Well, there is some question as to

6

the effective date of that, but that really has no bearing

7

on this case, because in the testimony of Trooper Adams at

MR. NEIMAND:

That is right, Your Honor, but we

are talking about the costs to the state when they take

that way in this Court.
MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor, I knew that it was not

going to make us look good coming up here, but the point
was it is something we just discovered Thursday.

We

wanted to put it before the Court in good faith.

At no

point has any date ever appeared in any opinion, any
brief, as to when those formal rules went into effect.
And those are the rules that the Florida Supreme Court
unfortunately was relying on when they wrote the opinion,

QUESTION:

Well then, you know -- certainly you

can't contend that the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Florida should be affirmed on this basis.

If there are

questions like this, perhaps that is all the more reason
for a remand.
MR. JOHNSON:

I think the case should be

remanded, to be candid, Your Honor.

I think the Florida

Supreme Court was operating under absolutely the wrong
guidelines.

But, if this Court wishes to reach to whether

the guidelines in this case were sufficient, I think the

Mr. Johnson, just in case we get to

the point, if — what kind of guidelines do you think

would be sufficient?

MR.

JOHNSON:

No, under a special exigency you

could then open, because the special exigency would be a

legitimate danger to the police or to the citizenry by,

is only one permissible rule that is constitutional for an

MR. JOHNSON:

Meaning no discretion, Your Honor?

Well, meaning no — perhaps no

discretion, or perhaps some discretion, but that one and

only one would comply with the Constitution.

possible that a no-discretion rule would comply with it,

22

and also that a discretion to open up containers that

Florida Supreme Court's opinion, is it, where it says the

opened.

MR. JOHNSON:

No, it is not, Your Honor, and I

have great difficulty with their opinion.

ruled in favor of the Respondent in this case, but we

13

don't necessarily think for the right reasons.

14

that they said absolutely no discretion, I think is too

far, and I have tried to explain why by the fact that

there is, there are circumstances under which discretion

should be appropriate.
