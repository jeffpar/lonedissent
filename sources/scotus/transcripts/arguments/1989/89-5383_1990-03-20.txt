ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARDNER W. BECKETT, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BECKETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Mark Howlett brought an action under Title 42,

12

Section 1983, the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1873.

13

defendants were the School Board of Pinellas County,

14

Florida and designated officials of that school board.

15

The action charged two offenses:

16

Fourteenth Amendment of the due process clause and a

17

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

18

The

a violation of the

The allegation with respect to the Fourth

19

Amendment was that the assistant principal of the high

20

school at which Mark Howlett was a student broke into his

21

automobile while the automobile was lawfully parked on the

22

school ground.

23

The second charge of — of violation of due

24

process was that in the ensuing suspension, which he

25

received for five days, the due process, as ordained by

this Court, was not granted.
The Circuit Court of Pinellas County, Florida is

2

3

a court of general jurisdiction in which this action was

4

brought.

5

the action on two ground.

6

sovereign immunity of the state of Florida barred the

7

action.

8

remedies had not been exhausted.

9

The Circuit Court of Pinellas County dismissed
The first ground was that the

The second ground was that the administrative

On appeal, the District Court of Appeals of the

10

Second District of Florida affirmed on the first ground

11

and did not reach the second ground, the first ground

12

being that there was a want of jurisdiction because of the

13

sovereign immunity of the school board.

14

law, the school board is immune from suit.

15
16
17

Under Florida

The guestion presented, therefore, is whether or
not the school board is immune under Federal law.
The Supreme Court of Florida, with one justice

18

dissenting, denied review, and this Court granted

19

certiorari.

20

The first question to be addressed is simply the

21

fact that the broad ground on which the District Court of

22

Appeal of Florida affirmed the dismissal is, as a matter

23

of law, incorrect.

24

jurisdiction exists when a state court exercises or

25

attempts to exercise jurisdiction under 1983 is solely a

matter of state law.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Beckett, would it be fair

3

to say that another way of presenting — of phrasing the

4

question is whether a state court has to entertain an

5

action brought under Section 1983?

6

MR. BECKETT:

No, Your Honor, we don't think

7

that because we think there's an intermediate ground in

8

which this Court has taken the position that where the

9

suit brought on a Federal claim is a claim which is within

10

a class of claims that the state customarily exercises

11

jurisdiction over.

12

Then, even without addressing the question of

13

whether the state would have to do it by direction of

14

Congress, they would have to do it simply because it is

15

within a class of claims which the state does entertain.

16

QUESTION:

So your — your position is that the

17

state entertains claims just like this against the State

18

of Florida, but it doesn't entertain a claim against —

19

under Section 1983?

20

MR. BECKETT:

Not against the State of Florida,

e

21

Your Honor, because one of the distinctions to be made is

22

that although the school board is immune from suit under

23

Florida law, it is not immune from suit under the rulings

24

of this Court under 1983.

25

QUESTION:

And so what are the other claims just

like this that are so similar that Florida entertains that

2

-- that this should be entertained too?
MR. BECKETT:

3

If Your Honor please, going back

4

to Claflin against Houseman, an 1876 case in which Justice

5

Bradley rendered the opinion of the Court, the claim there

6

was based on a — an assignment in bankruptcy.

7

court refused to entertain it on the ground that the

8

assignment in bankruptcy was solely a matter of Federal

9

law.

The state

In a rather elaborate opinion, Justice Bradley

10
11

explained that because of the dual nature of our court

12

system and the dual nature of the laws of this country,

13

that it -- the state court was required to entertain the

14

action, an assignment in bankruptcy, because it routinely

15

handled assignments in other matters.

16

In other words, the mere fact that it was an

17

assignment from Federal law was not a reason to deny the

18

claim.

19

QUESTION:

Well, then what are the kinds of

20

claims that Florida courts routinely handle that would

21

cover this sort of claim?

22

MR. BECKETT:

Florida, Your Honor, has a general

23

statute which abolishes or waives the statutory immunity

24

of the state and its agencies in all tort claims except

25

tort claims involving so-called discretion or

1

discretionary acts.

2

It — there have been a number of rulings,

3

including a ruling by the Supreme Court of Florida, that

4

this general waiver of tort liability does not extend to

5

constitutional torts under 1983.

6

juxtaposition which Your Honor is inquiring about, a

7

general release of authority, a general waiver with

8

respect to torts, but as to constitutional torts, no

9

waiver.

10

And thus, we have the

That's the -- that's the general set-up.
QUESTION:

Is there a waiver as to torts which

11

were claimed to be violations of the state constitution?

12

Have the Florida courts spoken on that?

13

MR. BECKETT:

Not by — not in the legislature.

14

There are one or two cases where the Florida Supreme Court

15

has ruled that a denial of due process can be of such a

16

nature that even though there is no provision under state

17

law, it simply will not be allowed.

18

One other point I'd like to make, Your Honor, in

19

connection with that, is that in Owen against the City of

20

Independence this Court established the rule that there is

21

no discretion to violate the Constitution.

22

And so anticipating the argument in the — which

23

we have received in the brief from the opposition, one of

24

the arguments is that the discretionary -- the

25

discretionary exception to the waiver covers this case.

1

We maintain that it does not because of this Court's

2

position in Owen, simply that it's not constitutionally

3

permissible to violate the Constitution.
Therefore, there cannot be any discretion in

that area.

include this class of cases unless there is going to be a

discrimination against Federal law.

Consequently, the general waiver also has to

Another case illustrating the same point is
Mondou against New York, a 1912 case, under the Federal

Employees Liability Act.

12

to the policy of the state of New York.

13

this Court said that any exception to enforcement must

depend on some outside reason.

simply a dislike of the cause of action.

In McKnett against San Francisco and -- St.

17

Louis and San Francisco Railway, a 1934 decision written

18

by Justice Brandeis, the operative provisions of the law

19

there — of the law of Alabama there were that a

20

proceeding which existed under the common law or under

21

statute law could be brought in the courts of general

22

jurisdiction of Alabama.

23

But the FELA could not be brought because it was

24

under Federal law and the express language of the Alabama

25

statute did not include a claim based on Federal law.

Could I ask you to come back to this

11

— this discretionary point.

12

agree, that a tort claim will not lie under its waiver of

13

sovereignty with respect to discretionary acts, and your

14

response is that there is no discretion to violate the

15

Constitution.

16

Florida law says, and you

Well, is that what Florida means by -- by

17

discretion?

18

to commit any tort in that sense.

19

I mean, I assume that there is no discretion

MR. BECKETT:

Well, that's not the sense in

20

which it's used in Florida, Your Honor.

21

many cases, in amicus brief in particular, in which it's

22

pointed out that any exercise of -- of discretion such as

There are a great

those things involving discretion and the exercise of

2

official duties generally are said to be discretionary and

consequently not waived.

4

QUESTION:

Well, why — why isn't there some

5

discretion involved here on the part of the principal as

6

to whether he had authority to make the examination of the

7

car that he did and as to whether the procedures that were

provided in the hearings were adequate?

some discretionary —

MR. BECKETT:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BECKETT:

Why isn't there

There is a --

— judgment implied in that?
There is a distinction, Your

13

Honor, between making a mistake and violating the

14

Constitution.

That's our position.

15

For example, a decision that he had authority to

16

change the hours of the school or that he had authority to

17

change — to put the car in a different parking lot, are

18

all discretionary matters.

19

But he did not have discretion to violate the

20

Constitution by breaking into the automobile when it was

21

lawfully parked and locked and there was not danger that

22

he was going to run away or anything like that.

23

the violation is of the reasonable —

MR. BECKETT:

it was necessary to move the car.
Our position is that that did not give him

authority to violate the Fourth Amendment by making an

unreasonable breaking in of the car.

15

and I think that's what Your Honor is suggesting.

say, for example, did he have time to get a warrant --

QUESTION:

He had alternatives,
If you

Well, you're making a quite different

18

argument though now.

Now you're making the argument that

19

in the facts of this case there was no discretion

involved.

But the —

21

MR. BECKETT:

22

QUESTION:

Because he —

But your initial argument was that no

23

violation of Section 1983 could come within Florida's

discretionary exception because there is simply never any

discretion to violate the Constitution.

If, as a matter of fact, there was

8

some reasonable action that could be taken, that was the

9

action which the statute — or which the Fourth Amendment

10

required.

That is a factual matter.
It's our position that there were ample actions

that he could have taken without breaking into the car.

Therefore, the breaking in was unreasonable, and

19

against the officials in their individual capacity had

been dismissed?

21

MR. BECKETT:

No, Your Honor.

We did not.

22

Under Florida law, a — a granting of a motion to dismiss

23

is error if it — if it can be reversed on any ground.

24

And we did not pursue those separate matters.

2

officers in their individual capacity?

3

MR. BECKETT:

We do know and they will.

Yes.

4

There is an abundant law that the — that the sovereign

5

immunity claim here extends --

6

QUESTION:

So in this — in this case you say

7

that even if — even if under Florida law the case against

8

the officials in their official capacity should have been

9

dismissed, in other cases they entertain the suits in the

10
11

individual capacity.
MR. BECKETT:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

12

it's our opinion that such a distinction could have been

13

made with the court in this case.

But it was not and we

14

did not pursue that aspect of it.

We pursued what we

15

thought was the central concern.

16

claim of sovereign immunity against the school board.

1

MR. BECKETT:

Our position is that where there

2

is a distinction, as there is in this case, between

3

liability under 1983 and immunity under the state law,

4

1983 controls.

5

The question of immunity under 1983 is a Federal

6

question and that of course was settled in Martinez.

7

Here, the court on the ground that we particularly attack,

8

said the school board was not liable because under Florida

9

law it was not liable, and that was the end of the matter.

10

QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't

11

say that if -- if Florida had never waived any of its

12

sovereign immunity for ordinary torts or any other set of

13

torts, you wouldn't say that Florida had to entertain 1983

14

suits would you?

15

MR. BECKETT:

We wouldn't say it on this basis,

16

Your Honor.

17

basis, simply that it was the purpose of Congress to make

18

it enforceable in state courts regardless.

QUESTION:

Well, would a -- would a Florida

duty?

MR. BECKETT:

QUESTION:

It would not.

Well, so why -- isn't fair to say

13

that Florida is treating both claims based on the Federal

Constitution on state tort law the same here?

15

allowing them against this particular entity in its

16

official capacity?

17

MR. BECKETT:

They're not

We don't think so, Your Honor, and

18

the reason is — the reason that I enunciated a little

19

earlier, the fact that there is no discretion to violate

20

the Constitution and the only exception to the waiver is

21

the discretionary exception, though we think that as a

22

matter of fact it cannot be brought within the

23

discretionary --

have been bringable in Florida?

Is the — is the

discretionary exception the reason you responded to the
Chief Justice the way you did, that the suit could not be
brought?
MR. BECKETT:

No.

It's not, Your Honor.

The

reason the suit could not be brought against the school
board or against the superintendent in his official
capacity is because they are immune from suit in their
official capacities.

If they were not immune, then the

question would arise as to whether the act was
discretionary.
QUESTION:

Well —

MR. BECKETT:

We say that it couldn't be

discretionary —
QUESTION:

They're immune, but you mean that —

you mean they were protected by sovereign immunity.
MR. BECKETT:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Yes.

MR. BECKETT:

That is correct.

We also take the

position that under Federal law sovereign immunity is just
one more example of an immunity claim which can be brought
or asserted under 1983.

And we, of course, take the

further position that it cannot be maintained.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Beckett, if a state decided

to waive its sovereign immunity, let's say only for

be entitled to bring an action in state court based on

Section 1983 for that kind of a tort?

not the tort we were seeking to redress was intentional.

QUESTION:

9

Well, you don't think then that there

10

could be any room for saying that a neutral state waiver

11

of sovereign immunity to a limited extent can be upheld

12

even though it's based on Section 1983 in state court?
MR. BECKETT:

13

That's really correct, Your Honor,

14

and the reason is the reason I stated, that there is no --

15

there is no authority to violate the Constitution.

the states to establish and limit the jurisdiction of

11

their own courts, and there is a single dispositive

question here:

state law and when it also lacks jurisdiction to entertain

analogous actions that are based on state law.

whether a state court must entertain a

And here I must disagree with the reading of

16
17

Florida law that Mr. Beckett presented to you when he said

18

that there was discrimination between state and Federal

19

claims.

20

It is clear in this case that this district

21

court of appeal didn't entertain petitioner's 1983 action.

22

It simply concluded that because the school board,

23

Respondent, has a common law immunity, an action against

Now what is the nature of the disability?

MR. ROTHFELD:

5

sovereign immunity is grounded in the state constitution

sovereign immunity entirely divests the court of subject

MR. ROTHFELD:

matter, I think Petitioner is not well placed to make his

argument about discrimination here because he did not make

it to the state courts, which could have authoritatively

11

settled it.

12

that the Florida law of sovereign immunity was irrelevant

13

in this case.

14

Before the state courts, he argued simply

He, therefore, did not argue discrimination.

He

15

did not even argue, for that matter, that the waiver was

Because Petitioner didn't present the argument

to the state court -- they could have authoritatively

shouldn't be heard to complain about that now.

Beyond that, the district court of appeal

clearly decided this case on the understanding that

analogous claims, claims analogous to Petitioner's based

2

on state law, would be barred.

3

that Petitioner was asking the state court to — the state

4

to open its courts to Federal claims that the state does

not otherwise recognize.

6

The court said explicitly

claims based on the Florida constitution, along with his

Florida courts do not discriminate against claims based on

11

whether they are state or Federal.

12

Beyond that, if the court were to look beyond

find, I think, that Florida's waiver is not

It seems to

meaning of its state law should be dispositive here in

this Court.

3

If there is any doubt on the point -- I mean,

4

the briefs cite an enormous number of opinions from the

5

Florida courts dismissing actions brought against the

6

state or its political subdivisions involving

7

circumstances quite similar to this.

8

9

I mean, if the court has doubt about the scope
of Florida law, I think the solution would be to send the

10

decision back to the Florida courts to determine whether

11

discrimination exists, if the court thinks that that's a

12

dispositive factor.

13

But, again, I think that the decision below

14

rests — gives the Court ample ground to conclude that

15

Florida courts do not view discrimination to exist.

16

QUESTION:

Tell me how you define the extent of

17

the sovereign immunity that is waived, because the statute

That's right.

And it says that there's a waiver in

that Florida courts have focused on is a portion that

makes the state liable in circumstances in which a private

party would be liable and the Florida courts have

interpreted that, as we read their decisions, to exclude

distinction between governmental and proprietary actions

and an action taken by a city employee which is said to

make the city liable, which is of a sort that the Florida

1

The Court has addressed in a variety of settings

2

similar to this the obligations that the supremacy clause

3

imposes on state courts to enforce Federal statutes.

it has routinely made clear that jurisdictional bars in

5

the state — in the laws of the states to consideration of

Federal actions are valid to permit state courts to

7

dismiss those actions.

8

9

And

The Court has said repeatedly, for example, most
recently in its decision this term in Tafflin v. Levitt,

10

that state courts may entertain Federal actions when they

11

have jurisdiction to do so under their state law and when

12

Congress hasn't vested exclusive jurisdiction in the

13

Federal courts.

14

The Court has indicated several times in the

15

cases that petitioner cites in Testa and McKnett and

16

Mondou that state courts must entertain Federal actions if

17

they have jurisdiction to do so under their state law, and

18

if they entertain analogous state law claims.

19

And at the same time, the Court has held

20

repeatedly in cases like Douglas and Mayfield and Herb v.

21

Pitcairn that states are not obligated to disregard

22

evenhanded limitations on their jurisdiction simply

because a claim that's presented to them is Federal.

The Court

9

But the reason I think that it's useful to view

this case in jurisdictional terms is not only because the

11

Florida courts clearly view sovereign immunity as

12

jurisdictional, but because as a matter of intent of

Congress in writing a statute like 1983, I think it seems

would be open to adjudicate the claim as it is against the

of it lacks jurisdiction to enter a judgment against that

such a jurisdictional limitation simply by enacting a

It seems (a) highly

And, secondly, the supremacy clause clearly

under this Court's precedence of its own force does not

impose an obligation on the state courts to entertain

particular because that's something that Petitioner I

think sort of runs away from and -- and for a very good

reason.

It is quite clear that when Congress enacted

exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts.
And while that exclusivity has been stripped

of the judicial code in subsequent years, there is no

indication in the language of 1983, or any other Federal

8

Congress intended to force litigation into the state

courts.

10

To the contrary, I think it is established

11

beyond any dispute, the statute was enacted precisely

12

because Congress mistrusted the state courts, because

Congress wanted to create a Federal court remedy for

deprivations of constitutional rights.

Congress constituted the Federal courts the primary

vehicles for enforcing Section 1983.

On the other side of the balance of interest,

17

there is not much -- the Federal -- Federal interest here

18

is relatively unsubstantial.

Federal courts are open to

19

entertain actions like this.

Under 1983 in particular,

20

the Federal courts were made the primary vehicles for

21

entertaining actions like this, and it should not be the

22

law, I think, that a statute like 1983 overrides neutral

23

limitation on the jurisdiction of state courts.

24
25

And that is not the law.

Just two months ago in

its Tafflin decision the Court said that state courts have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARDNER W. BECKETT, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. BECKETT:

9

The fourth case that I would have cited in this

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

Court's line of what we call intermediate cases where

11

there is an entertaining in the state court of a similar

12

cause of action is Testa.

13

written in 1947 by Justice Black and it, I think, contains

14

important language on the question on which we're

15

thrashing around here about jurisdiction.

16

And Testa was a decision

In Testa, Justice Black said it doesn't make any

17

difference how you characterize the defense.

18

put it on jurisdictional grounds or was done in Testa, on

19

the ground that the Federal government was a foreign

20

sovereign and, therefore, the state of Rhode Island would

21

not enforce a foreign penal statute.

22

Whether you

The -- Justice Black answered that by saying

23

from the Federal viewpoint how you characterize it is

24

immaterial.

25

of action which, had it not been Federal rather than

The question is do you have a Federal cause

state, would have been enforced.

And the answer was yes.

2

Rhode Island had a similar statute.
The other argument in that connection is a

4

slight misapplication of the idea of the neutral rule,

5

that if a — this claim should be barred because the court

6

does not otherwise entertain this type of claim.

7

question is whether it entertains the class of claims,

8

which it does.

under the authorities I cited, the fact that it wants to

It entertains tort claims.

QUESTION:

(Inaudible) example of Florida

13

attempting to immunize from suit only prison officials

14

just wouldn't work.

15

MR. BECKETT:

It wouldn't work because once

16

Florida creates a class as the — Justice Brandeis said,

17

the Alabama courts, the courts of general jurisdiction,

18

they can entertain these claims, it must entertain this

19

claim and not discriminate merely because it's Federal.

That just all depends upon how you

Honor, and that's where -QUESTION:

MR. BECKETT:

QUESTION:

It's

if we

I mean — you -- you — you can

define the class as prison officials or you can define the

class as tort claims.
MR. BECKETT:

5

You cannot define it simply as the

class which is excluded.

7

membership in a class which is recognized and enforced.

It has to be defined as

QUESTION:

What about membership in a class of

9

lawsuit defendants?

You know, it really just depends of

10

what level of generality you're talking about.
MR. BECKETT:

11

That's correct and we think that

12

there is guidance from this Court on that point.

13

other argument that we have in our brief which this Court

14

I think would be interested in is the so-called half-loaf

15

argument.

16

The

It's quite clear from such cases as Maine

17

against Thiboutot and Felder that once the state courts

18

entertain a 1983 action, they may not give a half loaf.

19

And in effect, that's what they are doing in this case.

20

They say we will entertain it, but we won't

21

entertain it against the school board.

The question is

22

when you entertain it, must you bring with the Federal

23

cause of action all of the baggage that it has.

24

answer to that is yes and in this case the liability of

the school board is established by this Court's decision
