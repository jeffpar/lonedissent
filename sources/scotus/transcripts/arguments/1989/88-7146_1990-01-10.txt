CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR L. ALLEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On February 10th of 1989 Ronald Gene Simmons was

11

convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death by a

12

lethal injection in the State of Arkansas.

13

date was set for March 16th of 1989, approximately five

14

weeks after his conviction.

15

His execution

Mr. Simmons expressed a desire that no appeal be

16

taken in his case and that the sentence of the jury be

17

carried out as ordered.

18

There was an intervention filed, as had been

19

done in a previous sentence of death rendered against Mr.

20

Simmons in the earlier case which we've called in our

21

brief Simmons I for clarity.

22

The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled upon the

23

question of the constitutionality of a mandatory appellate

24

review in a death penalty case.

25

look at some of the opinions of this Court, notably Gregg

With a rather cursory

v. Georgia, Jurek v. Texas, Proffitt v. Florida, the
Arkansas Supreme Court found no constitutional requirement
of an appellate review.
And that trial and conviction occurred in 1988.
The trial in February of '89 had no appellate record made,
no -- or no transcript prepared for appellate review.
There was, in accordance with ruling of the Arkansas
Supreme Court, a hearing held in the trial court level to
determine Mr. Simmons' competency to waive appellate
review.
He was examined by a psychiatrist at the
Arkansas State Hospital and was determined to be competent
to make that waiver.

Although in a later hearing there

was some reservation expressed by the examining
psychiatrist concerning some more recent expressions from
Mr. Simmons that may have expressed a degree of mental
disorder, neither the trial court nor the reviewing court
on appeal found these to be significant enough to make his
waiver involuntary.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, you represent Jonas

Whitmore in this case?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And what is Mr. Whitmore's standing

before this Court?
MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, his standing is

predicated upon several things.

In the State of Arkansas,

2

although not constitutionally required to do so, our

3

supreme court has committed itself since the 1970s to a

4

system of comparative review in death penalty cases.

5

In other words, they have taken the issue that

6

this Court looked in Pulley v. Harris and made it a part

7

of state law to say that in each death penalty case they

8

will review that individual's crime against other capital

9

cases in the State of Arkansas.
In this instance, the state has not put Mr.

10
11

Simmons' conviction and the attendant facts within that

12

data pool that Mr. Whitmore is to be compared against.

13
14

QUESTION:

But hasn't Mr. Whitmore's conviction

already been affirmed?

MR. ALLEN:

It has -- it has been affirmed on

18

the State of Arkansas, at — and is currently in federal

19

habeas.

It has been affirmed in state post­

At the state post-conviction stage, the State of

21

Arkansas in its briefs conceded that Mr. Whitmore was

22

entitled to a hearing.

23

but a concession as to a hearing on several grounds in his

24

case.

25

Not a concession as to the merits,

He has a separate

15

Court that it is overwhelming, but I would suggest to the

16

Court that the proper test to apply is the one of Justice

17

Brennan's comments in his dissent to Valley Forge, which

18

is that the dividing line should be no injury and some

19

injury rather than asking the Court to get into weighing

20

and assessing the total weight of the injury.

Not just a

Well, your Honor, again —

QUESTION:

1
2

Certainly, that was -- that was the

rule of Valley Forge, was it not?

3

MR. ALLEN:

It cannot be a hypothetical or —

4

QUESTION:

No, but I mean, even if it's actual

5

it has to be something beyond a mere peppercorn, so to

6

speak.

7

MR. ALLEN:

Oh, I don't think the Court used

8

that expression.

9

slightly earlier case, the Scrap case, was that a mere

10
11

One expression what was used in a

trifle may be sufficient.
QUESTION:

And your claim here is that although

12

your client has already had his conviction affirmed and

13

the proportionality review conducted by the Supreme Court

14

of Arkansas he — and has lost in state post-conviction

15

remedies, he is now in Federal habeas and he might obtain

16

a new trial there and then he would go through the

17

proceeding again and would be affected by the fact that

18

Mr. Simmons' capital case was not in the pool from which a

19

proportionality review is convicted?

20
21
22

MR. ALLEN:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

And, of course -QUESTION:

Why isn't that hypothetical?

You --

23

you -- you had just finished saying that the injury has to

24

be something more than hypothetical.

25

hypothetical that your — that your client will get his

conviction set aside and be tried again?
MR. ALLEN:

2

Your Honor, the difference there is

3

the difference between future or threatened injury and

4

hypothetical.

5

Hypothetical assumes all facts, whereas -- and

6

again, the Court has in a number of decisions, including

7

O'Shea, and in fact in a footnote to Valley Forge, looked

8

at threatened injury.

9

be a future injury.

So, it's clear that the injury can

That's Mr. Whitmore's personal interest in this.

10
11

There are other reasons, as cited in the brief, for

12

allowing standing to Mr. Whitmore.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I assume the difference between

14

future and hypothetical is sort of the difference between

15

standing under a chandelier whose -- whose connection has

16

broken and is -- is -- is in the process of descending on

17

your head.

18

That's a future injury.
And a hypothetical injury would be standing

19

under a chandelier that is perfectly well-attached to the

20

ceiling.

Now, why isn't your client in the latter case?

21

MR. ALLEN:

22

QUESTION:

Because -In the latter situation?

There is

23

nothing happening -- about to happen to him.

24

depends on his getting his conviction set aside.

25

purely hypothetical that it'll do that.

At this stage it's still hypothetical, though,

5
6

That's in the future to be sure, but not

isn't it?

7

MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor.

I would suggest

8

that it's not hypothetical.

It is perhaps slight.

9

But there is a threatened injury to Mr. Whitmore of a

10

right asserted to him by the State of Arkansas.

11

slight that may be, whether in fact the Court might

12

consider it to be a trifle.

13

Amendment death penalty considerations, virtually anything

14

that influences the ultimate decision to impose a penalty

15

of death should not be considered merely trifling or even

16

hypothetical.

However

Within the context of Eighth

The other reasons for standing as regards Mr.

Whitmore again go back -- to look at earlier cases of this

made.

22

A part of the ability to proceed in behalf of a

As the Arkansas court's opinion, as set out in

23

the joint appendix, shows, they used the Rees v. Peyton

24

test, which is the functional equivalent of competency to

25

stand trial, to waive a jury.

5

you may not

The only advice he has had as regards to this

6

case is the advice of the trial counsel who have adamantly

7

and vigorously advocated that their own client be put to

8

death, who have filed as Respondent briefs in this Court

9

statements which say that they are not familiar enough

10

with the death penalty laws in the State of Arkansas to

11

present that issue as opposed to the Attorney General for

12

the State of Arkansas.

13
'ii

Who, for example, has said to him:

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, you're not arguing that the

Simmons' waiver was invalid, are you?
MR. ALLEN:

I seriously question the validity of

16

that waiver under those circumstances.

The advice that he

17

has had in this case, distinguishing it from his earlier

18

conviction -- no one other than the trial counsel have

19

advised him as to trial errors.

20

Now, the trial judge, based upon representations

21

made by trial counsel, has advised him of potential error.

22

Now, in Simmons I, the earlier case that was

23

tried in 1988, it went into Federal habeas.

24

district court appointed an independent attorney, ordered

25

a transcript to be prepared -- and, in fact, I think had

There was then a lengthy report filed with the

fact, that independent report on the first conviction

6

showed at least seven grounds of reversible error, one of

7

which would have negated the death penalty.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

And, in

Well, does any case from our Court

require that extensive a proceeding as you've just
described in order that a waiver be deemed competent?
MR. ALLEN:

11

Your Honor, this Court has only

12

addressed waivers in death penalty context after they have

13

reached habeas -- with the exception of Gilmore, which we

14

have yet to discuss.

15

it in the context of waiving a direct first appellate

16

review.

17

But this Court has never discussed

You have looked at it in collateral proceedings,

18

post-conviction and Federal habeas, wherein the harm that

19

we are seeking to redress here did not occur because there

20

had been an appellate review.

21

The probably best analogy for another reason to

22

grant standing is a review of this Court's cases in the

23

area of the First Amendment, the heightened interest that

24

the Court has shown.

1

Eisenstadt, the Court has not hesitated to allow -- I

2

shouldn't say has not hesitated because not all opinions

3

have been unanimous -- but certainly the gist and the

4

thrust of this is that the rights of third parties may in

5

fact be asserted.

who himself has suffered an injury.

MR. ALLEN:

QUESTION:

By someone who himself has standing,

MR. ALLEN:

Yes, sir.
Wouldn't you agree with that?
Yes, sir.

I would.

And, of course,

11

to reach that point, to take it out of the realm of the

12

hypothetical, there has to be an injury, which is what we

13

are alleging on behalf of Mr. Whitmore.

14

again

15

QUESTION:

And the Court has

(Inaudible) just any -- any person --

16

any member of the public can come in and say Simmons'

17

waiver was invalid and therefore I want to appeal his

18

case.

19

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, as much, perhaps, as I

20

would like to advocate that, I think this Court's

21

decisions are uniform in showing that generalized

22

grievances are redressable through the political front

23

rather than through the judicial front.

24

That almost --

QUESTION:

So the fact that -- so the fact that

1

the waiver, you say, is questionable really doesn't add

2

anything to Whitmore's standing, is it?

3

MR. ALLEN:

It does — it, of itself, doesn't

4

add anything more to his standing.

In other words, his

5

injury is the first threshold that has to be addressed.

6

But in the presence of -- again, to use phrases from the

7

cases -- weighty countervailing policies, which there can

8

hardly be, even with the importance of the First

9

Amendment, a weightier issue than the imposition of the

10

death penalty, that the standing requirement, that

11

threshold requirement, may in fact be lowered almost on a

12

balancing basis.

13

lowering of that first threshold question.

The importance of the interest, the

QUESTION:

That --

Mr. Allen, could I ask you --

15

assuming that you have standing, do you know any case

16

where we've allowed someone who would — assuming he would

17

be injured by something that occurred at the trial level,

18

we've allowed someone not to intervene down there but to

19

bring an appeal here on the basis of that standing?

I mean, I -- I would think that if I sit out a

proceeding in the district court that might affect me, I'm

out of luck.

I can't then come in at the court of appeals

1

district court judgment, but this -- this seems to me a

2

very strange procedure.

3

Assuming you -- assuming there is a real

4

interest here that would confer standing, does it -- does

5

it enable you to sort of jump into a lawsuit, in the

6

middle of it, and appeal a -- appeal a suit that hasn't

7

otherwise been appealed?

8

9

MR. ALLEN:

There is a strange -- or an

appearance of strangeness here, Your Honor, because of the

10

absence of Simmons I from being with this.

11

the intervenor was a Catholic priest, Father Franz, who

12

filed at the trial court level to appeal and to order a

13

transcript prepared.

14

In Simmons I,

The trial court dismissed that appeal at the

15

trial court level and refused to have a transcript

16

prepared even though that intervenor was, as I understand

17

it, prepared to pay for the transcript.

18

QUESTION:

So --

He wasn't asserting his own standing.

19

He was -- he was asserting the standing of the -- of the

20

convicted person himself, wasn't he?

trying to come in as next friend?

QUESTION:

Yes.

Wasn't he just

So that's quite different from what

you're trying to do here.

1

that Franz v. State failed on its face, is that it did not

2

express more than a generalized grievance over a

3

constitutional defect.

4

That's what distinguishes Mr. Whitmore's

5

position, is that rather than a generalized grievance

6

saying the State of Arkansas, nor any other state, should

7

execute an individual who has not had the full continuum

8

of rights guaranteed under the Eighth Amendment.

9

The state would ask that the appeals process be

10

looked at as a separate and discrete part of the process.

11

You go to trial and from whatever happens through that

12

point on is separate.

13

That's, I believe, not a correct position in the

14

context of death penalty cases, partially because death is

15

in fact different.

16

perhaps unique procedures to ensure that it's not unfairly

17

imposed; that -- excuse me -- that it relates to

18

appropriate penalties for certain crimes, as in Coker, for

19

example; that it only is imposed on deserving defendants,

20

as in Jurek v. Texas; that mitigation is allowed in its

21

full scope — Lockett, Skipper.

22

It's entitled to higher safeguards, to

And the importance -- the constitutional

23

importance of the appellate review has been addressed in a

24

number of cases in this Court -- that — I won't go back

25

through at any length.

As early as Gregg, of course, the

1

Court has said that the presence of a mandatory appeal was

2

an important component of allowing a state's death penalty

3

statute to stand.

4

More recently, the Court has looked at other

5

statutes and has upheld them in part based upon the

6

presence of that mandatory appeal feature.

11

Even the State of Utah that carried out the

12

MR. ALLEN:

Arkansas does not place the burden

in that regard upon either the state or the convicted.

They do an independent review themselves.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The position of the State of Arkansas in this
case is simple and direct.
First of all, Jonas Whitmore, the petitioner,

23

does not present this Court a case in controversy, as

24

required under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution,

simply because Ronald Gene Simmons is not a minor.

And, thirdly, the protected right that Jonas

Whitmore so allegedly advances to this Court, or the right

that should be protected by this Court that gives him

standing, is one that clearly is speculative or conjecture

11

or hypothetical because, as you have heard, in his

12

conviction for a capital offense he was sentenced to die

13

by injection.
He had a direct appeal.

1

of death similar to the circumstances in the case in which

2

it was imposed against him.

3

I submit to you that simply what we have here

4

after the post-conviction relief was denied was a

5

situation where Mr. Whitmore is before this Court for the

6

reason that he would love to frustrate the death penalty

7

process in Arkansas because by frustrating it he slows its

8

implementation against him.

9

But he has no standing here, none whatsoever.

10

He has not alleged or articulated one fact that shows that

11

he has any particular legal interest that is at risk or at

12

jeopardy by the state going forward with the execution of

13

Ronald Gene Simmons.

14

But, secondly, if this Court should find for

15

some reason that there is standing in this case, I further

16

submit to you that the State of Arkansas' death penalty

17

procedures are constitutional and are not violative of the

18

Eighth Amendment, and we do not impose the penalty of

19

death in an arbitrary, capricious or freakish manner.

20

This Court has said since the trilogy of cases

21

of Proffitt and Jurek and Gregg that when you decided the

22

case in Spaziano that there was not one right way -- you

23

didn't single out that there was one right way to have the

24

death penalty process applied.

25

You further said in Pulley that when you looked

1

at this process you looked at the whole of the process.

I

2

submit to you that the Arkansas death penalty procedures

3

provide more than adequate safeguards to ensure that there

4

is no arbitrary or capricious application of this penalty

5

of death by simply providing the following.
First, in Arkansas you can only have the penalty

6

7

of death imply -- applied against you by a jury.

You

8

cannot come forward and plead guilty and have that penalty

9

applied by a sitting trial judge.

Only by a jury.

In our bifurcated system, in terms of death

10
11

penalty cases, we must first adjudicate guilt beyond a

12

reasonable doubt, and then we move to the sentencing

13

phase.

14

these.

15

Additional safeguards that we find there are

First of all, the state must prove guilt beyond

16

a reasonable doubt of one of seven aggravating

17

circumstances, and the jury must unanimously concur in

18

that and sign that they are of that opinion.

19

by strict rules of evidence in that phase of the

20

sentencing.

21

We are bound

Secondly, in that sentencing phase, the

22

defendant is allowed to offer any evidence of mitigation

23

that he would like to offer against the state's

24

aggravating circumstance.

25

of evidence.

He is not bound by strict rules

And the jury must conclude, again

(800) FOR DEPO

1

unanimously, that the aggravation beyond a reasonable

2

doubt outweighs the mitigation.

3

Thirdly, the State of Arkansas then is required

4

to prove to that same jury that beyond a reasonable doubt

5

the only proper punishment that can be assessed is the

6

penalty of death, having a jury instructed that they are

7

permitted to impose the sentence of life without parole.

8

Meeting all of that burden, there is one

9

additional safeguard in the Arkansas death penalty

10

procedures, and that is one that simply says that the

11

trial judge, after hearing — yes, Your Honor.

12

13
14
15

QUESTION:

I'm — I'm just curious.

How many do

you have on death row in the State of Arkansas?
MR. CLARK:

Thirty-two people on death row,

Justice Blackmun.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CLARK:

Any females among them?
There was one, but her case was

18

overturned and she's now serving life without parole.

19

There are 32 males on death row, 11 of which are black,

20

and the remainder are white or Hispanic.

21

The final safeguard, though, in the instance of

22

a death penalty procedure in Arkansas is that once the

23

trial judge hears the implementation of the sentence, the

24

trial judge on his own motion can set aside the penalty of

25

death and order the penalty of life without parole.

And so I'll simply say to you that those

1
2

safeguards rise to a standard that ensures that the Eighth

3

Amendment is not violated in the sense that it is

arbitrarily or capriciously applied or in some freakish

5

fashion.

QUESTION:

MR. CLARK:

If there

is no standing, you do not need to get to those issues,
and I submit there is no standing.
THE WITNESS:

So probably that's the first thing

we look at, isn't it?
MR. CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.

I submit that that

14

is the first thing you look at.

15

Whitmore has failed to give this Court any indication that

16

he has standing by decisions that you have articulated.

17

In this instance, Jonas

Simply, he has no right to be protected.

It is

18

purely speculative that at some point in the future in his

19

petition at habeas where he alleges a state of

20

incompetence that he might -- he might -- get a court to

21

set that aside and get a new trial in Arkansas and not

22

have a proportionality review that includes Simmons.

23

QUESTION:

Do you think he would have standing

24

if he were here in a situation where his own

25

proportionality review had not been conducted yet?

MR. CLARK:

1

No, Your Honor, I do not.

I think

2

in the instance of Jonas Whitmore, had he not taken a

3

direct appeal at this point, he still would not have

4

standing before this Court because the proportionality

5

review process in Arkansas is one that has never been

6

articulated by rule by our Arkansas Supreme Court, though

7

-- or mandated by a public policy from the legislature.
The court simply says we do this and doesn't

8

9

outline for us the practice in which or the procedure in

10

which they do conduct this review independently and on

11

their own.
There is nothing to ensure, even if he had not

12

13

taken a direct appeal that, when they contrasted the

14

proportionality review with Jonas Whitmore, that they

15

would include the crimes involving Ronald Gene Simmons.

16

We do know, as a matter of fact, that when he

17

did take it to direct appeal they contrasted him by stated

18

public opinion against people who were guilty of similar

19

types of crimes, robbery and murder.

20

in crimes in which he took the deaths of 16 individuals,

21

which took place over a 24- or 48-hour period.

Not those involved

So, our supreme court at least has given us some

22

23

insight to say they contrast people on death row with

24

similar type crimes, although there is not an articulated

25

procedure.

1

Thirdly, I would say to this Court, if there is

2

some troublesome issue to this Court concerning waiver, I

3

submit to you that there has been a clearly knowing and

4

intelligent waiver and that the standard is actually

5

higher than that in Arkansas, which is additional

6

safeguards in the application of the penalty of death.

7

5

Please understand that after Simmons I was

8

decided and Mr. Simmons said, "I want to die," his case

9

did go forward to the Arkansas Supreme Court, advanced by

10

Father Franz as next friend, and the Arkansas Supreme

11

Court found no standing.

12

forward on habeas to the United States District Court,

13

Eastern District of Arkansas, and Judge Isley found no

14

standing.

or years, or perhaps longer than the lives of all of us

10

The trial counsel said, "Please, Mr. Simmons,

collectively in this courtroom."
And he said, "I understand that.

11

I waive."

And

12

then he simply said to him, "Mr. Simmons, understand, the

So this case, I think, fails from the

Clearly, they rise to a level to afford the protection to

issue.

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but you say that -- you

20

say that if this fellow changed his mind an hour before

21

his execution was scheduled, he'd get an appeal.

22

MR. CLARK:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Well, then the public defender wants

24

to be able to talk to him up till the minute of the

25

execution and the people -- and the prison says, sorry,

the fellow's waived and that's the end of it.

2

MR. CLARK:

Well, in the instance, Your Honor, I

3

think in terms of the waiver.

4

the position of the State of Arkansas, once waived, as the

5

case is now with Ronald Gene Simmons, that's not absolute.

6

That's not — it is revokable.

7

I submit to you that it's

He revoke that up until the hour before his

8

execution.

That revocation, obviously, Your Honor, comes

9

upon a knowledge and understanding on his own.

I don't

10

think that constitutionally is predicated on the right to

11

give him particular access to a public defender or other

12

counsel.

13

Your hypothetical is distinct from the case at

14

bar because in this instance Mr. Simmons has retained

15

counsel, and they were to be present the night of his --

16

what would have been his execution on March the 16th --

17

March the 15th.

18

this Court stayed that execution.

They were there that night in 1989 before

QUESTION:

The only thing I am suggesting,

20

Counsel, is that perhaps you're right on the merits with

21

the waiver and all the rest of it, but the standing

22

position could be quite extreme in some -- in some cases,

23

I think.

MR. CLARK:

Yeah.
— and it seems grossly extreme.
Yeah.
But in the instances, I think this

Court is bound by that standing provision of the

10

Constitution.

And in this instance, this petitioner

11

woefully is inadequate in his ability to rise to the level

to show standing.

QUESTION:

MR. CLARK:

He has appointed counsel now?
He has retained counsel, Justice

Kennedy.

MR. CLARK:

Yes, sir.
Do -- do we know that that retained

counsel will remain with him throughout the period during

which the sentence is being executed, up to the last hour?
MR. CLARK:

In addition, there were other safeguards added

Clinton, that we could ensure right up to the last minute

that there's no extant record of this trial?
MR. CLARK:

2

I am not disturbed by that at all,

Justice Kennedy.

The fact that I know that in the

instance of the waiver, the knowing waiver, that Mr.

5

Simmons was given ample opportunity to discuss

6

specifically deficiencies in the state's case.
He had been given that private consultation by

his retained counsel.

He had been given that consultation

And that was reviewed one more time by the

I think in this instance that a criminal

defendant in the process who can make a knowing and

life and death, can take that action.

MR. ALLEN:

Very briefly.

In response to

3

Justice Kennedy's question, it bothers me very much, Your

4

Honor, particularly when that answer is related back to an

5

earlier statement of the Attorney General that there were

6

seven issues presented that might have successfully set

7

aside the death penalty.

8

presented in Simmons I.

9

that many in Simmons II.

There were that many issues
Respondent has said there were

What that is saying is that this may in fact be

10
11

a person who is not eligible for the death penalty under

12

the law.

And Respondent is not bothered with that.

13

The question of retained counsel -- and coming

14

back to the adequacy of that waiver -- and I believe Mr.

15

Justice Kennedy asked about whether counsel would stay on

16

the case.

17

has been some published comments made recently that would

18

suggest they probably will not, other than perhaps a book

19

deal coming through on this.

20

There is no indication of that.

In fact, there

I would direct the Court's attention to page 17

of those counsel's Respondent's brief only to give the

22

Court a feel for the representation that Mr. Simmons

23

received at his trial.
