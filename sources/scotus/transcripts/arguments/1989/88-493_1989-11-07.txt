CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning on No. 88-493, the University of

5

Pennsylvania v. the Equal Employment Opportunity

6

Commission.

Mr. Lee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is very narrow because of

13

the facts out of which it arises and the way the Third

14

Circuit decided it.

15

Professor Rosalie Tung, contending that her

16

denial of tenure by the University of Pennsylvania's

17

Wharton School of Business was based on gender and

18

national origin discrimination, filed a claim with the

19

EEOC which initiated an investigation and eventually

20

issued a subpoena.

21

Among the items sought by that subpoena are

22

confidential peer review materials in Ms. Tung's file and

23

also the files of five male candidates.

24

supplied all of the documents sought by the EEOC except

25

for the peer review materials.

The University

As to those, it concluded that its ability in

1

the

2

future to obtain confidential, candid evaluations

3

indispensable to its tenure determination would be

4

impaired if expectations of confidentiality were breached.
QUESTION:

5

(Inaudible) peer review materials are

6

7
8

MR. LEE:

Yes.

They basically fall in two

categories, Justice White.

9

One is both outside and inside evaluations of

10

the candidate's work that are made by colleagues.

11

within the Wharton School and some from business schools

12

in other parts of the country.

13

Some

And the others are the deliberative materials

14

similar to a confidential conference held in any context,

15

in which the persons responsible for making the tenure

16

determination meet, discuss, as the minutes of those kinds

17

of meetings.
The Third Circuit conceded that disclosure would

18
19

infringe the University's right to determine who may

20

teach.

And both the Third Circuit and the government here

MR. LEE:

Right according to what?

1

which we contend — well, and really the

2

concedes, that it is First Amendment based.
QUESTION:

3

government

Well, Mr. Lee, that certainly is a

4

weak sort of a First Amendment interest and wouldn't the

5

same interest extend to employees of a newspaper or a

6

public advocacy organization or to a wide range of

7

employees?

8

Amendment interest, if it is such.

It strikes me as a rather minimal First

MR. LEE:

9

Well, at least — for what, now? —

10

over 30 years the Court has acknowledged that academic

11

freedom is based in the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but that's really language from

13

our cases where you're talking about a state university,

14

where you're talking about the state infringing it.

15

There is really no holding of this Court that

16

says that professors are any freer from state infringement

17

than any other type of people who might have freedom of

18

speech infringed.
MR. LEE:

19

I think that's probably right, Mr.

20

Chief Justice, that in — well Keyishian might be a

21

holding.

22

Court has dealt with the issue, and in each instance there

23

has been — the Court has said that the First Amendment

24

does include academic freedom and that academic freedom

25

includes the right to determine who may teach.

There have been four instances in which the

Now, to be sure, this is the first case that has

1
2

squarely raised that question.

3

at the very least — it must be agreed, as I think it is

4

on all sides, that there are — that it is a serious

5

constitutional issue.

6

comes before this Court, there are two elements to the

7

issue.

And as a consequence, as the cases

The fist is did Congress really intend to give

But at the very least —

to the EEOC a completely unlimited, unqualified,

10

absolutist right to all peer review materials,

11

notwithstanding any absence of a particularized showing on

12

the part of government that it really needs it.

therefore, the narrow nature of the issue that this Court

2

is being required to pass on today.

3

At the very least, there is a serious

constitutional question here, so that in deciding whether

What is this serious constitutional

Justice.

It is this, Justice — Mr. Chief

In order to carry out what we contend and

10

actually what this Court has said on four occasions is a

11

First Amendment-based right of academic freedom, and

12

particularly its component of who may teach, it is

13

essential that the University have available to it those

14

materials that will enable it to carry out — to carry out

15

that determination.

16

I would invite your attention in that respect to

17

the briefs that have been filed by the Association —

18

American Association of University Professors and the

19

American Council on Education.

20

In the event that — well, in the event that the

21

University does not have available to it these

22

confidential peer review materials, then there would be

23

substituted in its place a substitute system which would

24

rely on informal communications and in which merit would

25

be replaced by influence and connections.

Excuse me.

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

5

QUESTION:

Go ahead, Chief Justice.

6

QUESTION:

Well, what case is — is the best

7

from this Court supporting a proposition that universities

8

have a First Amendment right to determine who should

9

teach?

10

MR. LEE:

11

QUESTION:

12

Four cases.
Well, what's the best one?

I don't

need all four.
MR. LEE:

13

The best one I would say is probably

14

Keyishian because it's a holding.

15

on Justice Frankfurter's earlier dictum that the Court has

16

repeated on four occasions that the right to determine who

17

may teach is an aspect of First Amendment freedom that is

18

protected — well, that is protected by the First

19

Amendment.

20

But it in turn builds

And, in a sense, the best case, though it does

21

not specifically —

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Who has this right?

it says we think all hirings in the university are going

to be made by a committee of the Senate, would that be

unconstitutional?

2

MR. LEE:

3

QUESTION:

Excuse me?
I mean, I guess somebody has a right

4

to say who may teach, but does it have to be the faculty?

5

Is that —
MR. LEE:

It — it would be those who are

7

responsible for determining the academic affairs of the

university.

No.

state.

19

You could

have a committee of the Senate —

11

13

So it could be the Senate?

The state Senate?
Right.
That would be a harder case, but, yes,

I suppose you could have thei governor

decide.

MR. LEE:

It would be a harder case.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

I mean, what is the principle that —

that members of a faculty have a constitutional right to

MR. LEE:

In the event —

QUESTION:

MR. LEE:

— like amoeba or what?

In the event that you had those kinds

8

of determinations that are central to the operation of the

9

academic mission of the university being operated, as it

10

never has, by someone in government, then it is that

11

entity that would enjoy the First Amendment freedom, yes.

14

QUESTION:
Amendment right.

So the government has a First

That's phenomenal.

MR. LEE:

It is — well, what you're posing for

15

me, of course, is a hypothetical that so far as I know

16

exists in no place.

17

under standard First Amendment principles established by

18

this Court is that when government — the only government

19

in this case is the United States of America, the Equal

20

Employment Opportunity Commission, who seeks access to

21

these confidential peer review materials.

22

But the proper framework for analysis

And when the government seeks to infringe upon a

23

constitutionally-protected right, then government must

24

show that that is supported by a compelling state interest

25

narrowly tailored
to the achievement of that compelling

state interest.
It happens that throughout our universities today

3

those rights are exercised.

4

determinations are made by universities.

5

stress that there are two bases on which the Court can

6

find that those are entitled to some level of protection,

7

that there has to be at least some kind of a showing —

8

some kind of a showing — that the government really needs

9

these materials.

10

QUESTION:

Peer review, tenure
And I want to

Well, Mr. Lee, the — the interest on

11

the other side in this case of a — a faculty member to be

12

considered for tenure without the impermissible

13

consideration of race or gender seems to be a much more

14

direct constitutional right that we're talking about.

15
16

What about the — the employee's constitutional
rights here?

17

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

We fully concede —
And certainly these — these

19

evaluations on which the tenure decision is based are of

20

critical importance.

be more relevant than an examination of those tenure

22

evaluation letters.

MR. LEE:

I can't imagine anything that would

There is no question that the right

24

to be free from discrimination is very important.

25

there is no question that these documents are highly

And

relevant to that issue.

But we're not the ones who are advocating an

3

absolutist point of view that that's the only thing that

you take into account.

will, is not permanently nailed to the floor.

have to take into account something on both sides of the

balance scale.

QUESTION:

11

MR. LEE:

We are the ones who are advocating

That you

Well, didn't Congress do that when it

No.

What Congress did when it enacted

12

Title VII was to determine that Title VII would be

13

applicable to universities.

14

great deal out of that proposition that Title VII is

15

applicable to universities.

And the government makes a

issue here.

whether Congress intended to give the EEOC access to peer

nothing in the statute that indicates that Congress even

The issue is not whether Congress intended to

MR. LEE:

Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware of any

practice in any other context, employment context, that is
analogous to the one that has developed with respect to
the exercise of the determination of who may teach.

15

In the industrial context, in any other context,

those decisions are made not by peers, not by colleagues,

field?

MR. LEE:

Justice Blackmun, you would be far

more aware of how that one works than I am.

QUESTION:

It seems to me, Mr. Lee, that the

have — holding contrary to your position.

Whereas, if we spread it to the newspaper world

and so forth, there might be a tendency for newspaper

people to be very cautious about recommendations.

There is some resiliency to it.

It really cuts in two
What you say is correct.

And that is why in the event that what were

11

adopted is what we're advocating, not an absolutist test

12

on our side but a qualified privilege such as the Seventh

13

Circuit has adopted, or a balancing test such as the

14

Second Circuit has adopted, so that people who give these

15

evaluations will know that there will not be routine

16

disclosure but that in the event a court, after careful

17

consideration determines that the case is strong enough

18

that it needs to be — that it needs to be disclosed, then

19

I think people will continue to give those assurances or

20

to give those evaluations in that kind of context.

21

But I will tell you — and this is not just my

22

own point of view.

It is substantiated by the

23

Association of American University — the American

24

Association of University Professors, the AAUP, the

and all these are referred to in the briefs

1

educators

2

— David Reisman and Paul Mishkin.

3

If what you have is the Third Circuit's view

4

becoming the national law on this subject, then there is

5

going to develop in place of this confidentiality-based

6

objective system — there is going to have to be some kind

7

of a replacement system for evaluation.

8

9

As Professor Reisman said, it's going to be the
informal telephone call that will replace the confidential

10

peer review evaluation, and merit and objectivity will be

11

replaced by informality and connections.

12

Instead of equality being the governing

13

standard, it will be, in its place, favoritism and

14

informal relationships.

15

QUESTION:

Why is that, Mr. Lee?

Are academics

16

so — so cowardly that they won't say openly what — what

17

they're willing to say confidentially?

18

there something in fact unattractive about a system in

19

which the applicant for a job is given it or denied it on

20

the basis of statements that he never — he never learns?

21

He doesn't — doesn't know why the trap door has been

22

pulled, he's just gone?

23

MR. LEE:

I mean, isn't

Well, as you well know, Justice

24

Scalia, there are in my profession a few cowards.

25

that isn't the principal reason that we're concerned here.

But

1

Confidentiality is just as important in the

2

academic setting, and the need to keep certain kinds of

3

communications confidential is just as important in the

4

academic setting as it is in the governmental setting.

5

The same kind of thing that led this Court in United

6

States v. Nixon to announce that there was a confidential

7

privilege for communications among government servants.

8

And it's not just a matter of —

9

QUESTION:

Well, wait.

But while you're talking

10

about an analogy to the Executive Branch, didn't we go

11

through this in the Executive Branch a number of years ago

12

when all executive agencies that get recommendations with

13

regard to potential hirees send notices to people whose

14

advice is asked about the qualifications telling them that

15

this may be made public?

16

Isn't it true that that material can be made —

17

can be received by the individual under the Freedom of

18

Information Act?

MR. LEE:

true that that has —

QUESTION:

Title VII.
MR. LEE:

2

That is correct.

It could be done,

3

Justice White, by construing Title VII and no one takes

4

Title VII literally at its literal language because if

5

Title VII did entitle the government to all relevant

6

evidence, then that would include privileged material and

7

even the government concedes that that is not the case.

8

That's one round.

9

Another is to say that you construe these

10

statutes in such a way as to avoid serious constitutional

11

questions, and, at the very least, the Court would have

12

some explaining to do as to what it really meant when on

13

four separate occasions it did say that academic freedom

is based in the — in the First Amendment.

MR. LEE:

1

Here's what I believe should be done,

2

Justice White.

And as I understand it, this is the way it

3

works, from my reading of the Notre Dame case and the Gray

4

case.

Here I think is the way it works.

5

The first thing they do is to — the first thing

6

that they would do is to look at the complaint on its face

7

and the complaint on its face says such things as that

8

Wharton is not interested in China-related research and

9

that there had been some sexual harassment.

10

Those kinds of claims can be investigated

11

without ever getting into confidential materials.

12

then there are other investigations that the court — that

13

the EEOC could make with materials that are non-peer

14

review, that are available to it.

15

And

All we're really asking is — at some point in

16

time the government is going to have to examine the

17

materials that it already has that we have given them

18

materials — non-peer review materials that we have

19

already given them --

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

12

13
14
15
16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In our view, four broad considerations should
guide this Court's analysis in this case.
The first is that privileges, although fostering

17

important relationships, also stand as obstacles to the

18

ascertainment of truth.

19

discovery of truth impedes as well the doing of justice.

1

recognized any number of exceptions to that rule by virtue

2

of the concerns about impediments to the ascertainment of

3

truth.

4

But the Court, Justice Blackmun, has been reluctant

5

to recognize privileges that have not enjoyed the sanction

of law.

7

Second, the recognition of privileges is a

well-established function of the judiciary.

quarrel with that.

We do not

describe at pages 31 and 32, approximately 20 percent of

We don't question that.

That value is trumped here by Congress' visitation to this

subject, its determination in 1972 to eliminate an

9

exemption that colleges and universities had previously

10

enjoyed by reasons, among other things, of concerns about

11

ac ademic freedom.

12

But in extending Title VII's coverage in 1972,

13

Congress was acting not just on the basis of the nation's

14

moral commitment to eliminate invidious discrimination,

15

but out of the Congress' express concern with

discrimination in higher education, discrimination

was especially difficult in terms of the barriers being

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Starr — General Starr, it

seems to me that the Third Circuit certainly thought at
least that furnishing the names might not be as relevant
and not as necessary and that that could be redacted.
Now, it seems to me there ought to be perhaps
some residual power in the court to determine the degree
of relevance and perhaps to redact names if it thought
that wasn't essential.
MR. STARR:

We have not cross-petitioned with

respect to the Third Circuit's determination, not that
there should be redaction but that redaction is open for
litigation at the district court.
And we would urge this Court not to in fact
interfere with that process.

have to in fact determine, based upon our analysis of this
file, whether we under the circumstances in the Third
Circuit will litigate in favor of unencumbered access.

Congress intended, which is unencumbered access.

MR. STARR:

I am not retreating at all.

What I

8

sought to clarify in response to Justice Scalia's question

9

was that, as I understand the law, a government subpoena

10

is under existing law subject to challenge not only on

relevancy grounds but on Fourth Amendment grounds and on

grounds that it is motivated by an impermissible purpose.

No.

The EEOC Compliance Manual is quite clear that
the Commission has the authority that Congress gave it —
Section 710 of Title VII — to issue subpoenas to obtain
access to evidence.

subpoena should be issued only after all other means of
eliciting information have failed.

unreasonable construction of the problem to say that the

MR. STARR:

I agree that it's normal enforcement

The comfort I can give to those members, if

21

any, of the Court who are concerned in this respect is

22

that if the nature of the defense — if the nature of the

What the
