ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIANA DROUS

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. DROUS:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before you today is may the police

13

officers seize an object not listed on a warrant when it

14

is in play view.

15

And I would start with when a seizure is made

16

without inadvertence it is not made pursuant to a search.

17

Excuse me, it is not a plain-view seizure.

18

fact, pursuant to a search.

19

a plain-view seizure here.

20

It is made, in

So, we really don't even have

There is — and the facts in this case are, the

21

police officers procured a search warrant.

When they did

22

so, they carelessly forgot to include all the items for

23

which they intended to seize.

24

premises, they searched for the items irregardless of the'"

25

fact that they were not listed in the warrant and, in

When they entered the

1

fact, found the items that they were looking for, except

2

for the items in fact listed on the warrant.
In order to find that inadvertence is not

3
4

required in this situation, this Court would have to

5

overrule Marron v. U.S.

6

indistinguishable from the facts here.

7

police officers entered a business establishment with a

8

warrant.

9

of the items listed on the warrant was liquor.

The facts there are
In that case, the

When they -- this was in prohibition times.

One

When they

10

went in the closet in which they believed the liquor might

11

be, they found ledgers and bills.

12

That court, seeing the issue which -- as simple

13

as it actually is -- said that the ledger and bills were

14

in fact not seized -- not listed in the warrant and,

15

therefore, not subject to seizure.

16

What the Attorney General of California asks

17

this Court to do is to create a new exception to the

18

warrant requirement.

19

Oh, my goodness, I forgot to get the warrant --

20

particularly describing the items to be seized.

21

The carelessness exception, the --

What that would do, it would nullify the

22

particularity requirement of the warrant clause of the

23

Fourth Amendment.

24

to allow that to happen.

25

QUESTION:

The Fourth Amendment is too important

Now, what if the officers in

obtaining and seeking a search warrant lack probable cause

2

to list some items on the search warrant and the affidavit

3

and, therefore, they don't.

4

because they do list those for which they have probable

5

cause.

Now they go into the premises

They go in and they see the items.

6

They were

7

aware of those items but knew they didn't have probable

8

cause.

Are those found now in plain view?

9

MS. DROUS:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. DROUS:

12

No, Your Honor.
No?
Not if the police officers intended

to search.

13

The purpose of the warrant requirement -- there

14

would be no -- police officers are required when they ask

15

for a search warrant to particularly describe the items

16

for which they intend to search.

17

to the magistrate to make the decision.

18

officers have no probable cause to search, they have no

19

business searching for those items.

20

QUESTION:

At that point, it's up
If the police

Well, I have put to you the

21

possibility that there may be several items, some of which

22

they have probable cause to get a warrant to search, and

23

some they don't.

24

for everything so they don't list everything.

25

they go to the house, they find it.

They know they don't have probable cause

But when

MS. DROUS:

1

Your Honor, if they find those items

2

because they searched for those items, the seizure would

3

be invalid.

4

QUESTION:

Now, they find it because it's in

5

plain view when they enter pursuant to a valid search

6

warrant for other items.

7

MS. DROUS:

If they find the items in plain view

8

and the seizure is inadvertent, yes, they may seize those

9

items.

10

QUESTION:

But they knew they were there, likely

11

to be there, but they lacked probable cause to include

12

them in the warrant requirement.

13

MS. DROUS:

The fact that you -- that you look

14

at, I believe, is -- for inadvertence, is whether or not

15

the police officers were in fact searching for them.

16

If they were searching for the items listed on

17

the warrant and came upon the items — the other items

18

that they knew might be there, that's not a violation.

19

QUESTION:

How do you -- how do you instruct

20

these police officers when you send them out?

21

let's -- you know, they -- they know the thing's "a", are

22

there, and -- and they have probable cause so that's in

23

the warrant.

24
25

Let's --

Thing "b" they suspect may be there.

So, when I send them out with their warrant,
what do I tell them?

Don't -- don't look for "b" whatever

you do.

How can you -- can you erase from your mind the
I

notion that "b" may be there?

I mean, this is a weird

rule you're proposing for -- for -- the police have to act
in some realistic fashion.

How can they possibly act that

way?
MS. DROUS:

There's a difference in saying, we

believe that "b" might be there, but don't look for it.
There's a difference in that and saying, well, the warrant
doesn't authorize the search, but look for it anyway.
Of course — and I understand what you're
saying —
QUESTION:
MS. DROUS:
QUESTION:

I mean, you -— and you're quite right --- you can tell them, don't look in

any place where "a" wouldn't be just because you think
that "b" might be there.
MS. DROUS:
QUESTION:

You can tell them that.

That's right.
But how can you tell them, while

you're looking for "a", for pete's sake, don't think "b"?
That's totally unrealistic.

And yet -- and yet you say

that if they're thinking "b" while they're looking for
"a", it's bad.
MS. DROUS:

If their intention in going into

that residence is to find "b", that's a violation.
QUESTION:

I don't know.

If --

Their intention is to

execute the warrant which let's them look for "a".

2

MS. DROUS:

3

QUESTION:

4

They also know that "b" might be

there.
MS. DROUS:

5
6

That's correct.

If they happen upon "b", it's a

valid seizure.

QUESTION:
MS. DROUS:

10

Well, —
In this — in this case -Happen upon it.

I --

— we have — we have the testimony

11

of the police officer that in — in fact, when they

12

entered the residence they intended to search for items

13

not listed on the warrant.
What would be the reason for getting a warrant

14
15

if the police officer — what would be the reason for

16

police officers to particularly describe all the items to

17

be seized if they could search for items not listed on the

18

warrant?

19

QUESTION:

The basic reason, I think, is to —

20

is to describe the scope of the search.

If — you know,

21

if — if -- if you're looking for an elephant, you can't

22

look in drawers.

23

24

proper scope of the search.

So where's there an elephant on the

MS. DROUS:

There's also the possessory interest

2

which the Fourth Amendment protects, as this Court has

3

recognized in a number of cases.

4

yourself in Hicks v. Arizona stated that the seizure and

5

search — that one interest of the Fourth Amendment is not

6

more important than the other.

7

You — Your Honor, you

In Place -- U.S. v. Place, this Court stated

8

that warrantless seizures are per se unreasonable.

As a

9

matter of fact, in Coolidge itself Justice Stewart stated

10

that even if the finding of contraband, stolen goods, or

11

things dangerous in themselves are found without

12

inadvertence, they may be seized.

13

And that is implicitly a recognition that in

14

those three items there is no possessory interest.

2

MS. DROUS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

order to enter the home, even if it's to search for

4

contraband or stolen items, the warrant must be obtained

5

to get into the home because that's the privacy interest.

6
7

There's a whole separate possessory interest
which is also protected.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, is there any indication in this

case that when the officers made this -- seized these

10

articles that are at issue that they were not in a place

where they were not entitled to be?

made this seizure?

MS. DROUS:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Well —
You can come to neither conclusion.
Well, but the -- the trial court

15

denied the motion to suppress and the court of appeals —

16

the court of appeals affirmed.

17

that they must have had some facts in mind when they made

those rulings?

Don't we have to assume

Well, Your Honor, the initial motion

20

made after the preliminary hearing was granted by the

21

magistrate prior to binding Mr. Horton over for trial --

the district attorney then filed the motion in the

does not follow the inadvertence requirement.
QUESTION:

Well, but that's all within a

framework of people -- of the officer being lawfully in

the place -- having a lawful right to be in the place

5

where he was and seeing -- seeing something that was

6

subject to seizure.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, in this case the

8

facts don't support the conclusion that the officers were

simply in a place where they had a right to be and saw.

10

They were --

QUESTION:

MS. DROUS:

QUESTION:

But —
-- looking for these things.
Well, but certainly the California

Court of Appeals, the California Trial Court, the Supreme

15

Court of California in deciding the North cases know this

debate about -- you know, is inadvertence a requirement.

17

Their findings, it seems to me, have to be looked at in

18

the framework of -- of that kind of debate in our Court.

19

They're not saying that the police can just go

20

and seize anywhere.

21

the police have a lawful right to be.

MS. DROUS:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

It amazes me how

2

often police enter a home and find all the drawers open,

3

all the doors open, and the boxes within the doors and

4

drawers open.

It happens all the time, but that's --

5

QUESTION:

That's the way it is.

6

MS. DROUS:

7

QUESTION:

That's the way it is.
Ms. Drous, could you tell me why --

8

why -- why would we -- we don't have an inadvertence

9

requirement for dispensing with a seizure warrant

10

elsewhere, do we?

I mean, if the police suspect, have

11

probable cause to believe that somebody will be walking

12

down the street with contraband, with illegal drugs or

13

something of that sort, do --

14

MS. DROUS:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Must they go get a seizure warrant

16

before they can come up and even though they lay in wait

17

fully expecting him to come, do they have to get a seizure

18

warrant?

19
20
21

MS. DROUS:

You mean when an individual is

walking down the street?
QUESTION:

Yes.

They -- they -- they have very

22

reliable information from an informant that he'll be

23

walking down the street with cocaine.

24

for him and see the cocaine, go over and seize it.

25

that — is that unlawful?

If -- if the police at that point

have probable cause for an arrest, the police officer may

arrest the person without a warrant --

QUESTION:

5

MS. DROUS:

Right.
— and the search of the person

would then be pursuant to that arrest.
QUESTION:

7

But -- even though they had full

8

knowledge and could have gotten a warrant for the seizure

9

you don't require advertence in that -- inadvertence in

10

that situation, do you?
MS. DROUS:

11

Well, because there you have an

12

exigent circumstance.

exception to the warrant of a search pursuant to an

14

arrest.

15

QUESTION:

You have — you have the legitimate

MS. DROUS:

QUESTION:

On the -- on the street?
Yeah.

See, I can't see why you need

22

an inadvertent requirement in the context in this case and

23

don't require it on the street.

24

MS. DROUS:

25

Because there you have the

difference of the rules relating to an arrest.

And in --

in that case, if you have probable cause to make the
arrest on the street -- if you do not go into the home,
you do not need a warrant.
QUESTION:

But once you have a warrant to enter

the home and your concern is with the possessory interest,
why isn't that met if the officers have probable cause to
seize the items?

This Court has consistently held

that probable cause alone will not support a warrantless
search and seizure.

It's not warrantless.

They have a

So, there is no additional

burden on the privacy interest at stake.

What you're

concerned about is the possessory interest in these other
items.

And why isn't that met by the probable cause that

the officers had?
MS. DROUS:

What you have there, however, is a

warrantless seizure, and warrantless seizures are not
allowed.
QUESTION:

Well, that -- that's not correct.

Warrantless seizures are allowed of objects within the
possession and the control of the arrestee, which is the

I think it's useful to examine Coolidge in its

historical context.

At the time of Coolidge the Court was

deeply divided over two issues, the broad scope of

searches incident to arrest and the allowance of

14

searches -- of arrests in the home without a warrant.

15

Hence, the basis for — hence, the basis for the citation

17

Neither of those concerns are present anymore.

18

In Chimel v. California the scope of searches was limited

19

to a small extent to the reaching area of the defendant,

20

and in Payton v. New York, the Court required a warrant

21

for an arrest in a home.

22

Therefore, there is no danger of the police

You've used the term "pretext"

several times, Mr. Kaye.
MR. KAYE:

How would you define pretext?

The lower courts generally agree that

a pretext situation is where you are obtaining permission
to search or arrest for one crime when the underlying
motivation is to look for evidence of a second crime.

Well, you say underlying motivation.

That means that they're not really interested at all in
the first crime or that there are two motivations?

Again, when you come to

15

this case, there is no good faith.

warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.

21

What there is is

Secondly, although we do not have the facts in

22

this case, it is correct that the inadvertence requirement

items are seized that are not listed in the warrant and,
