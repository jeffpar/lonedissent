breached, does not apply to pre-employment severance

payments.

proper bounds of a reviewing court in disregarding the

20

amply-grounded findings of the trial court that none of

21

these men accepted that severance payment with the kind of

22

intent that Section 209 in other situations may prescribe.

20

The one overarching issue with which the government

21

has never come to grips in this case is the following.

Could the government, the day after these payments were

made by Boeing to employees still on its payroll, who, as

indictment in that situation?
MR. LACOVARA:

I think not.

The government

12

certainly has never alleged in this case that the conduct

13

here constituted an attempt to commit crime.

14

QUESTION:

I'm just asking hypothetically.

Could,

15

would the facts you state support an indictment for an

16

attempt?

17

MR. LACOVARA:

I think probably not, although the

18

general law of attempt does apply to many criminal cases.

19

But here what you have is a statutory definition of a

20

particular conflict of interest crime, and for reasons

21

that we will discuss in a moment, Justice Kennedy,

22

Congress drew the line where it wanted to draw the line in

23

distinguishing lawful conduct from unlawful conduct.

24

it is important, I think, to preserve that bright-line

25

distinction, lest we criminalize a whole category of

And

1

relationships that Congress never intended to cat — to

2

criminalize.

3

QUESTION:

What if the employer, before the

4

government service began, paid a sum to the employee on

5

the understanding and expectation that the employee might

6

provide some favors to that employer later, during

7

government service.

16

And it is

very important to --

11

15

That is an issue with which Congress

Would it violate this section as well?
No, no.

It would not.

Simply because of the timing.
That's right.

And that is

explicable, I think, in light of the -QUESTION:

Well, you certainly can read the

17

language of the statute as not turning on the timing of

18

the payment.

19

the government salary, you certainly can read Section 209

20

as being applicable.

21

MR. LACOVARA:

If — if the payment is made to supplement

Well, our opening submission,

22

Justice O'Connor, is that that is not a correct reading of

23

the language and that under the rule of lenity, if your

24

suggestion is that one could read the statute this way,

25

ambiguities in criminal statutes are to be resolved

1

against the government.

2

that talks about making a payment to, or a contribution

3

to, or — supplementing the salary of a government officer

4

or employee, I suggest it is at least a strained reading

5

to say that the timing makes no difference.

6

Where you have statutory language

But when you look at what Congress has done in

7

trying to deal with the problem that you identify it

8

becomes clear, and this is why I say that in reading this

9

statutory language, as revised in 1962, the Court ought to

10

consider the other statutes that Congress revised in 1962.

11

The bribery statute expressly deals with that situation.

12

Congress knew how to write that language.

13

payments made not only to incumbent federal officers or

14

employees, but, as the statute defines it, persons

15

"selected to be" public officers or employees.

16

It covers

Similarly, Section 203 of Title 18, which was

17

revised at the same time as this statute was revised,

18

punish — punishes certain kinds of compensatory payments

19

made to a person for services to be rendered at a time

20

when he is a government officer or employee.

21

two examples of Congress' knowledge of how to reach pre­

22

government employment payments, if they are made with the

23

kinds of intent that are described in Section 201 and

24

Section 203.

So there are

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Lacovara, the Fourth Circuit relied

2

upon the 1962 change in this statute to say that whatever

3

may have been the case before then, they thought it now

4

covered pre-employment payment.

5

MR. LACOVARA:

That is correct.

The Fourth Circuit

6

relied exclusively on that change.

It is, I think, common

7

ground now that the predecessor to this statute only

8

reached payments to incumbents.

9

government officer or employee accepts the payment is

It said whoever being a

10

guilty of a crime.

11

did it, however, with an explanation of what limited

12

changes it intended to accomplish in revising the

13

language.

14

think it is important to do what the Fourth Circuit

15

apparently didn't do, which is to read Congress' own

16

explanation of whether it was intending to make what I

17

submit would be a fairly substantial change in the

18

coverage that the statute had in its prior form, which was

19

clearly limited by time to incumbent government employees.

20

Congress took that out in 1962.

It

proposed the bill that ultimately became law, and this is

QUESTI ON:

So it leaves a rather large hole in the

15

statutory scheme, doesn't it, if an employer, a month

16

before someone becomes a government employee, can pay them

17

a large amount of money to tide them over the time that

18

they will be a government employee.

19

MR. LACOVARA:

If we were sitting down today to

20

write legislations, Chief Justice, we might want to draw

21

the line differently.

22

the statute had in mind when it was -- Congress had in

23

mind when it first enacted this statute in 1917, which was

24

to prevent carrying people on the payroll of a private

25

benefactor with the concern being, a concern that doesn't

But that is not the purpose that

apply when the payment is made before government service,
the concern being that the person who is supposedly
discharging his duties with an eye solely on the public
interest may be looking over his shoulder to see whether
or not his judgments will -- will affect whether that
economic lifeline, as the New York City Bar put it, is
going to be cut off.

That danger is simply not there, the

danger of divided loyalty, serving two masters, when an
irrevocable, fixed, non-contingent payment is made before
government service.
Now, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, if there is
some other understanding, that could constitute a bribe.
Congress has defined the point where the bribery statute
applies, at a certain point before government employment,
but not at the -- not infinitely back from government
employment.

So, Congress has decided to deal with a

particular problem, divided loyalty.

It rationally chose

to draw the line at incumbency.

Section 1914, it has

certainly drawn the line there.

The explanation for the

changes in language in 1962 suggest only -- only a
narrowing purpose, changing the prior phrase in connection
with government employment to a phrase, as compensation
for government employment.

And if Congress had intended

to cover a whole new class of payments, especially in
light of the fact that severance payments, pre-employment

1

severance payments, are, as the government has agreed,

2

quite common, one would think that Congress would have

3

said something about that.

4

When one looks at the reasons for dropping the

5

magic phrase on which the Fourth Circuit exclusively

6

focused, one sees that, in the original staff report back

7

in 1958, a House staff report, there was a suggestion that

8

that phrase be taken out, because the staff wanted to

cover not only officers of the executive branch, but also

members of Congress.

That the

It is something else?

That is -- the government would make

here, payments received from prior employers, it is

significant that the second subsection of Section 209,

payments from prior employers, permitting continued

participation and severance and other employee benefit

plans while the person's in government.
So, just looking at the text of Section 209, it

12

seems to us that there is no exclusion for lump sum

payments.

14

is consistent with the purposes of Section 209, which is

15

to prevent the divided loyalty.

that, Justice O'Connor.

First of all, as we point out at

15

fact taken the position before the amendment of the

16

statute in 1962 and the provision in the memo quoted in

17

the Roswell Perkins Law Review article, that the -- that

18

the statute did apply to severance payments made prior to

19

the entry onto government -- government service.

20

reason for that is understandable.

1

government official or employee.

The second paragraph,

2

however, had no such limitation.

It says or in any way

3

supplements the salary of a government employee.

4

and one of the problems with the statute as it read prior

5

to the 1962 amendments was there was an absence of

6

correlation between the first and second paragraphs.

So —

7

And so there was substantial support for the

8

proposition that the -- that the statute, particularly the

9

second paragraph, even prior to the passage of 1962,

10

covered such payments, and in fact the report of the

11

Association of the Bar of the City of New York, which was

12

one of the two studies that gave rise to the 1962

13

amendment, specifically noted this ambiguity but said the

14

statute should be clarified to make sure that it covers

15

payments whenever received.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kneedler, this is a criminal

recovery are defined precisely by the terms of this

statute?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

cause of action to recover payments made to its employees

in violation of fiduciary duties.
QUESTION:

3

Right, but that, that common law cause

4

of action presumably would encompass whether there's

5

disclosure, whether there were secret profits taken, or

6

something of that sort.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I think the cause of action

would extend to violations of the fiduciary duty, however

9

that fiduciary duty is defined.

fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of payments for

But you are tacking a common law cause

action traditionally has required non-disclosure in order

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I think not.

And let me explain

18

again why I think that is not so.

In a traditional suit

19

of common law, if an employer brings a suit against his

20

employee, he would be bringing a suit to enforce whatever

21

contractual or other relationship there was between the

22

employer and the employee, according to the terms of that

under those cases.

There was nothing in the disclosure

to, either on the disclosure forms or in the conversations

3

with individual officials at the Defense Department, to

4

suggest that these were payments made only because the

5

employees were going into government service or that they

6

were calculated in a way that were validly designed to

7

supplement the government — the employee's services.

8

So there was nothing on the face of these forms to

alert the persons reviewing them that they even presented

10

a conflict of interest situation that the government could

11

in turn waive or regard as being an affirmative

disclosure.

If the employees had changed their mind

and not gone to work for the government, I assume Boeing

district court found, yes.

But as Mr. Little, the vice

president at Boeing, testified in his deposition, the --

Boeing had no reason to doubt that these employees were

going to go into the government when they left.

may be that, for reasons beyond the recipient's control,

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it's possible that the

government could, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, it's not -- that is critical to

your interpretation of the statute.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in this, yes.

In terms of the

18

criminal violation, for purposes of the civil recovery,

19

all that's necessary for the court to say is that at least

20

at the time they became federal employees they had a duty

21

to account to the government for any payments they

22

received for their government service prior to that time.

23

And that's all that is necessary to say here.

24
25

They all --

all five in fact did quickly become government employees
after they received these payments.

QUESTION:

Well, could — I take it the person who

changes his mind, goes to work for the other company, he

could be convicted under this statute, and so could his

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

Mr. Kneedler, what if, instead of paying

7

severance payments, Boeing had a policy of paying bonuses

8

upon employment after government service, and paid

9

precisely the same amounts -- I don't know whether these

10

people did go back to Boeing, but assume they had been

11

totally severed, worked for the government for three or

12

four years, then went to work for Boeing and received

13

advance payments that more or less supplemented for the

14

sacrifice they had made in the prior three years.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

It would be the same result, and for

16

good reason.

17

has reason to anticipate that he is going to be rewarded

18

in the same way —

19

If a person, while in government service,

QUESTION:

So it applies to -- if a law firm hires

20

a person out of government service and pays a higher

21

signing bonus, in effect, to compensate for the decreased

22

earnings while in government service, that would violate

23

this statute, if it is an executive employee.

MR. KNEEDLER:
the purpose.

If it -- again it would depend on

be the basis for the signing bonuses for people coming

elaborate explanation that the purpose of their policy was

because they thought these people would be back, likely

come back, and they would have increased experience when

10

they got back, and therefore be more valuable to them.

Would that be permissible?

would.

QUESTION:

Excuse me, conceivably, yes, it

permissible, then how do we know these findings are

clearly erroneous?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if they —

On intent.
If they are being paid -- if they

are being paid for -- if they are essentially being paid

for their government work, as it seems to me these people

23

were being paid to accept their government job, that's

sufficient.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, if you could answer one

8

short question.

I think there is a short answer, but it

9

escapes me at the moment.

Can the government, or does the

10

government ever rely on state law?

11

law in the state of Washington that protected you in this

12

instance.

13

Or is the argument that since there is no federal law, the

14

probably intent is that you not recover?

Could you just sue under the Washington law?

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

Suppose there was a

I would think that ordinarily we

16

would — we would — because the relationship between

17

prospective employees in the federal government is one of

18

federal law, that we would ordinarily be limited to

19

federal law, although conceivably federal law might borrow

20

a state statute or principle on a particular case.

21

here we are not relying on a particular aspect of state

22

law.

But

23

I think it -- with respect to the argument on the

24

legislative history, I think it is critical to point out

25

several important defects in what the Petitioners rely on

in the legislative history in 1962.

First of all, the

2

phrase being a government official or employee in the

3

first paragraph of Section, then 1914, was specifically

4

dropped from the statute at that point.
And Congress had two purposes — Congress did two

5

things.

7

limited to executive employees only, which is the only

8

purpose the Petitioners mentioned, but they also did

9

something else.

It both defined that phrase more precisely to be

reference to the types of employees further down in the

first paragraph, referring only to the time of the

performance of the services.

way, precisely what Congress did when it modified the

16

former Section 281, now Section 203, which bars the

17

receipt of compensation for services performed for someone

18

outside the government while you are a government

employee.

Congress also deleted the phrase "being a

21

government official" right at the same place in the

22

statute and moved down further in the statute the

specification of the -- of the precise categories of

24

employees that are covered.

history shows, that was done for the specific purpose, and

And as the legislative

the staff report that we cite in our brief says this, it

2

was done for the specific purpose of making clear that the

time of the receipt of the payment did not matter.

4

it was — at the time that the services were performed.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Was that done at the same time?
It was done at the same time in

1962, and the precise phrase was dropped from both places.
Mr. Lacovara says that the, relies on the phrase
"to be rendered" in Section 203 and the fact that Section

10

203 covers members of Congress elect.

The fact is that

11

the predecessor statute had precisely the same coverage.

12

It contained the word, and this is important, it contained

13

the phrase "to be rendered," the very phrase he relies on,

14

and it also covered members of Congress, even before they

15

qualified, or after they have qualified for office, even

16

if they haven't taken it.

17

rendered" that covered employees, persons before they

18

became employees.

19

that was deleted here that resulted in the coverage of

20

persons before they enter into government.

So it was not the phrase "to be

It was the deletion of the same phrase

21

And in fact at page 61 of the staff report, which

22

again formed the basis for the statute, the staff report

23

states that this language dealing with government

24

officials or employees was modified to conform its scope

25

to Section 281 as the staff report proposed to revise it,

which would have covered all three branches but also would

have revised it to apply only when, in that case, when the

services are performed, not when the payments are

received.

MR. KNEEDLER:

The staff report of the judiciary

principal basis on which the revision was — the 1962

revision was based.

Mr. Kneedler, could you provide us with

employment, can receive an award, or even during

QUESTION:

Thank you.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Also, I should point out that the

21

consistent position of the Office of Legal Counsel and of

22

the Office of Government Ethics has been that the statute

23

applies to payments made prior to the time that a person

enters into government service, which, after all, is

consistent with the position that the Justice Department
