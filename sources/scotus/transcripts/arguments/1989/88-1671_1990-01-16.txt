MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

We'll hear argument

The question presented in this is whether the
system for awarding attorney's fees in the Federal Black
Lung Program violates the due process clause by denying

i;
claimants access to counsel.
16

We believe that the holding below, that the fee

17

system is unconstitutional, is wrong for two basic

18

reasons.

19

meritorious black lung claims are being lost because of

20

the attorney's fee system; or even that attorneys are

21

unavailable for vast numbers of claimants.

22

First, there is no adequate showing that

Second, evaluated under the Mathews v. Eldridge

23

test, the black lung system does not deny claimants

They also provide that no fee will be charged if
the applicant does not succeed in obtaining benefits.

9

These provisions serve the goals of maximizing

10

the use of funds for the benefit of claimants, and

11

relieving claimants of the responsibility of paying fees,

12

win or lose.

13

Any system of fee regulation will discourage
some attorneys from participating.

But in the context of

15

this disability program, in which fee regulation is

16

designed to protect claimants, and where changes to the

17

fee system will impair other important government

18

interests, we believe the Congress and the Department of

Labor must have considerable flexibility to structure

MR. DREEBEN:

1

The court, when it issued its

initial opinion, invited the Department of Labor to

intervene in the proceeding as a party, either to seek

rehearing or to file a petition in this Court.

We don't actually believe the Court need to

MR. DREEBEN:

Only if the Court concludes that

the Committee on Legal Ethics does not have standing so

that the case is not properly in this Court, unless the

It

really does rely on state bar organizations like the

Committee on Legal Ethics to enforce its regulations

through the enforcement of their own disciplinary —

4

QUESTION:

You mean if a lawyer just, without

5

regard to local discipline, just went ahead and ignored

6

the regulations and charged people fees that the

7

Department didn't approve and all, there would be no

8

remedy, other than — other than ethical remedy?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I wouldn't say that there

10

would be no remedy.

11

remedy if there were fraud involved.

12

QUESTION:

There would be possibly a criminal

No, assume no fraud; just assume they

13

— they think it's a bad statute and the people are

14

entitled to representation, and they're willing to work

15

for a black lung claimant if they get paid.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

There — there is a limited amount

17

of machinery built into the current system that the

18

Department of Labor might be able to draw upon to

19

discipline attorneys or to preclude them from representing

20

claimants in the future.

21

It doesn't have a — an adequate disciplinary

22

mechanism, because its primary function is really to

23

adjudicate black lung claims and to pay beneficiaries, not

24

to police attorneys.

25

Now the rules are there, but it's been the

1

long-standing practice of the Department, which it's found

2

satisfactory, to rely on state committees on legal ethics

3

to enforce unlawful fee arrangements.

4

QUESTION:

May I ask also, is — is that also

5

the practice under the Longshoremen's Act, which I guess

is the basis for — for this procedure, that they — they

7

don't really enforce the provision, other than relying on

8

local bar associations?
MR. DREEBEN:

9
10

That's my understanding, Justice

Stevens.
I don't think that this has been a major problem

11
12

in the sense that there has been hundreds of cases that

13

the Department of Labor becomes aware of in which people

14

ignore the fee regulations, and the Department doesn't do

15

anything.

16

function, and most attorneys probably are not going to

17

deliberately flout rules that they know are valid.

18

I think cases like this serve a deterrent

However, there has been something of a problem

19

in the black lung area, particularly since this case,

20

because some attorneys have notified the Department that

21

they believe that the regulations are no longer valid and

22

they intend to charge contingent fees and to collect 25

23

percent of back benefits.

24
25

And that does directly infringe upon the policy
that supports the fee regulations.

1

We believe that the attorney's fee system is

2

constitutional if evaluated under the Mathews v. Eldridge

3

test, which the court below purported to apply but we

4

believe applied incorrectly.

5

I'd like to note at the outset that it's notable

6

that this decision rests upon an extraordinarily frail

7

factual record.

8

— to talk about how the fee system actually affects the

9

incentives of attorneys, other than the affidavits of a

10

relatively small number of attorneys, and some selective

11

citations from congressional testimony.

There is very little in the record, other

12

We do not believe that that is a sufficient

13

record to support a finding of unconstitutionality in

14

dealing with a large-scale benefits program like the one

15

at issue here.

16

inappropriate for a court to determine on such a small

17

record that the Department has not acted in good faith to

18

develop adequate procedures.

19

Now, we also believe that it's

But, regardless of the criticisms of the record,

20

we also think that the court went seriously astray in

21

applying the analysis directed under Mathews v. Eldridge.

22

There are two important government interests

23

that are served by the fee regulations.

24

benefits go for the benefit of a qualified claimant, or an

25

applicant's survivor, so that the money that the
11

(800) FOR DEPO

The first is that

1

government devotes to this program serves for the support

2

of coal miners and their survivors and doesn't, in effect,

3

turn into a lawyers' relief act, in which substantial

4

amounts of the benefits are diverted to attorneys.
There is also a secondary motive underlying the

5
6

fee regulation of ensuring that claimants do not make

7

improvident agreements with attorneys.

8

reason there is an approval requirement even when

9

claimants do bear their own fees, which they do if a case

10

And for that

is not contested.

11

There is a second important government interest

12

that I believe the court overlooked, and that is the

13

following.

14

by shifting fees to the losing party, the responsible

15

operator or the trust fund, the government has a

16

substantial interest in assuring that the system under

17

which that party must pay the fees determines the fees

18

fairly.

19

Once Congress determined to protect claimants

In other words, it's not appropriate that the

20

fees would be paid before a benefits award is final,

21

because in that event the attorneys may collect the money

22

that subsequently has to be repaid, and this could prove

23

difficult as a practical matter.

24

May I ask one other preliminary

1

situation in which a potential claimant would like to

2

consult an attorney about whether or not he has a valid

3

claim that he'd like to pursue?

4

the attorney for that advice?
MR. DREEBEN:

5

May he do that and pay

I'm not aware of any case that's

6

actually raised that, Justice Stevens.

But I think we

7

would take the position that that kind of consultation,

8

preliminary to a benefits application, could not be

9

compensated without approval from the appropriate agency.

10

And if no claim were actually filed, I believe that it

11

would be impossible for the attorney legitimately to

12

charge.

13

One important aspect —

14

QUESTION:

And what is the government interest

15

that justifies that prohibition?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

The government interest that

17

justifies that prohibition is in having a program that

18

offers to claimants and their survivors the opportunity to

19

apply without having any risk of paying attorney's fees at

20

all.

21

There is no reason why a claimant who is not

22

going to receive a benefit under this program pay

23

attorney's fees in order to find that out.

24

I believe, is the theory underlying the total prohibition

25

of any attorney's fees, unless the claimant actually
13

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

That at least,

1
2

prevails.
And so for that — that purpose actually helps

3

claimants, because they can go to an appropriate Social

4

Security office or Department of Labor office and receive

5

a claims information form that tells them here are the

6

basic criteria in the program.

7

have an attorney and you won't have to pay if you prevail

8

and it's not contested.

9

It provides that you will

And I think that that's a substantial government

10

interest to be able to offer in a disability program of

11

this type that was designed to reach hundreds of thousands

12

of people, many of whom may have no idea whether they

13

actually do have a valid claim, but might be willing to

14

pay two, three, four or $500 dollars to find that out, and

15

would thereby just lose that money.

16

I was saying that there is a second government

17

interest in this program, and that is to ensure that if

18

fees are to be borne by the losing party, they are

19

determined fairly.

20

that no fees are paid until a benefits award is final.

21

also supports the method of determining fees in this case,

22

which does not permit great multipliers.

And that support is in the requirement

23

It does account, I would like to stress, for

24

both the delay factor and the risk of loss factor that

25

were very heavily relied on by the court below.

It

Lung Benefits Act account for these two factors is by

3

assuming that the hourly rate of attorneys practicing in

this field takes those matters into account.

5

Attorneys have argued in various papers filed

6

with the government that these methods are not adequate to

7

provide sufficient compensation.

8

answer to that is the statute does call for the payment of

9

a reasonable attorney's fee.

The way in which the Longshore Act and the Black

But I think that the

The Department of Labor has

interpreted that to include a risk of loss component.
And the attorneys who are dissatisfied with the

12

exact way in which that's been applied can continue to

13

litigate that, and can attempt to obtain a larger benefits

14

award — or a larger award of attorney's fees if they

15

believe it's justified by the statutory criteria.

J

16

But any system of awarding fees that is in a

of forcing attorneys to be somewhat selective in the cases

2

civil rights claims of one kind or another and claims

3

against the government — would you think that would be

constitutional?
MR. DREEBEN:

5

I'm not sure, Justice Stevens,

6

whether it would or wouldn't.

It would — the — it would

7

depend upon a rather particularized analysis of exactly

8

what is at stake in each type of program.
What makes this program special is that it is a

9
10

Federal disability benefits program in which the

11

government is prepared to come up with money to pay people

12

who satisfy these statutory criteria.

13

QUESTION:

Of course, the government has to come

up with money to pay people whose constitutional rights

15

are violated if they sue them (inaudible).

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

you're saying.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not really sure what

constitutional provision would be involved.

6

question would be whether the Court was prepared to say

7

that someone who has a — someone who was an applicant has

8

a protected property interest.

9

The first

We would dispute that, and if that contention

10

prevailed then there would be no constitutional issue,

11

other than either a First Amendment or some sort of a

12

liberty issue in consulting counsel, and it's not clear to

13

me that either of those interests would be sufficient to

14

determine that this program is unconstitutional.

15

This is, after all, a program in which Congress

16

is attempting to supplement financial benefits for a

17

certain category of workers, and it sets up a program

18

which it believes is fair.

19

that it's fundamentally unfair to people who proceed pro

But in Walters,

19

the Court noted that the program at issue in Goldberg

20

didn't have a policy against prohibiting the welfare

applicant from dividing his check with the lawyer, and

22

that policy is very clearly present here, just as it was

QUESTION:

But weren't you suggesting, in answer

3

to my and several other questions, that there is

4

constitutional authority to prohibit counsel?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

I think there would be

6

constitutional authority to prohibit counsel, provided

7

that the procedure itself is designed to operate without

8

lawyers, which was the case in the Walters decision.

9

It really is not the case here to the extent

10

that the Department of Labor actually wants lawyers out of

11

the system.

12

What it does is provide what it believes is fair

13

compensation for lawyers, and it provides a procedure

14

where, if somebody does not proceed with a lawyer, they

15

still have a fair chance to establish their claim.

16

balances various factors.

17

It doesn't want lawyers out of the system.

And it

It tries to ensure that government money is

18

essentially applied to the benefit of beneficiaries, it

19

tries to ensure that claimants don't squander their fees

20

consulting attorneys when they don't have a valid claim.

21

And we think that Congress really needs to have a

22

considerable amount of latitude to structure these types

23

of programs within the general bounds of fairness.

say that those interests would best be served by flatly

8

it — there is regulation in the black lung regulations

9

that provide for appointment of counsel.

And at one point

10

the Department of Labor did provide counsel for claimants

11

to represent an initial award when it was being challenged

12

by the responsible operator, which it is 90 percent of the

13

time.

14

They also — the Department of Labor also

15

provided informal conferences, as the Social Security

16

Administration does, to work with people and to help

17

unrepresented people put their claims together.

18

Both of those practices have been discontinued

19

without any explanation.

20

this is a clear recognition on the part of the Department

21

that people need help.

22

There's — I would contend that

The Department of Labor argues that we should

23

use fundamental fairness, and I would go along with that.

24

That's fine.

fundamental fairness is a procedure that is tailored to

2

the capacities and circumstances of those to be heard to

3

ensure a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

4

The Department of Labor argues we can't provide

5

for better representation of claimants because it will

6

cost money and because it will make the process more

7

adversarial.

9

In other words, if we ensure that claimants are
as well represented as the operators and the trust fund,

10

there's a real danger that eligible miners who are now

11

being lost in the morass are, in fact, going to be able to

12

successfully pursue their claim and they're going to

13

demand benefits.

14

The West Virginia Supreme Court found that this

15

was an unconstitutional kind of fiscal responsibility

16

which is denying the benefits that Congress has promised

17

to sick old coal miners who, by the way, the Department of

18

Labor tells us three-quarters of the claimants never

19

attended high school.

20

So, we have the — these sick old coal miners

21

with less than a grade school education defending their

22

claims against highly paid, skillful experts in the field

23

of black lung law.

a 5 percent approval rate at this time.

It is not surprising that we only have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. DREEBEN:

7

The low approval rate in the program as it's

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

currently structured is not an accident.

9

aware when it tightened the eligibility criteria in 1981

Congress was

10

that there would, indeed, be a low approval rate, and

11

there is no showing in this record or anywhere else that

12

I'm aware of that that low approval rate flows from the

13

presence or absence of counsel in a particular case.

14

The respondent has relied quite heavily on the

15

affidavit of Ms. Denney.

16

affidavit indicates that there is a higher rate of

17

representation than Respondent would have one believe, and

18

the burden in this case was not on the Department of Labor

19

to establish the constitutionality of its program.

20

burden was on whoever challenged it to establish that it

21

was not constitutional.

22

I would only suggest that

The

And, finally, the regulation that governs fees,

23

we believe, is consistent with the statute and can be

24

applied consistently to provide a sufficient incentive for

25

lawyers to come into the system.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Dreeben, am I correct that the

2

agency concedes that the rate has to be high enough to

3

allow for the contingency?
MR. DREEBEN:

4

Justice Scalia, the agency

5

construes a reasonable attorney's fee to include a

6

component for risk of loss and for delay.
There's going to be some fighting about how you

7
8

determine those two factors, and I don't think that the

9

Department would agree with some of the proposals that

10

have been made to it to give a multiplier of two, three,

11

four, five or six because of the contingency factor.

12

In any area where there's a contingency factor

13

lawyers are going to be selective, but I think that's a

14

good thing, not a bad thing, and the regulation is

15

adequate to provide a sufficient fee, we believe.

16

the lawyers disagree, they can litigate that issue.

17

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr.

Dreeben.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
