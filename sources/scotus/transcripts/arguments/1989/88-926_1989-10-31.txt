ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NICHOLAS J. SPAETH

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

10

MR. SPAETH:

Thank you.

Chief Justice Rehnquist,

members of the Court, and may it please the Court:
It is a special privilege for me to be here because

11

it is only two days shy of the State of North Dakota's

12

hundredth birthday.

13

The question presented in this case is whether the

14

state, in an effort to prevent bootlegging of liquor from

15

military enclaves, may impose a requirement on the suppliers

16

of that liquor to the bases that requires them to put a label

17

on each bottle destined for the military enclave indicating it

18

is to be consumed only on the base.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't all the law says, is it?

You can avoid putting that label on if you do something else.
MR. SPAETH:

22

that is correct.

23

QUESTION:

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. SPAETH:

If you buy it from a local distributor,

Oh yeah, yeah.

That is correct, and pay the tax.

QUESTION:

MR. SPAETH:

All right, all right.
We don't have a bootlegging problem with

that, because there isn't a price differential.

That is correct, because the taxes have

QUESTION:

Well, what's the purpose of the North Dakota

requirement?
MR. SPAETH:

To prevent bootlegging of the liquor off

20

the base.

21

on the base and off the base, because off-the-base liquor

22

sales are subject to the distribution system and the state

23

taxation.

24
25

There is a price differential between liquor sold

On-base sales are not.

QUESTION:

What sorts of diversions constitute the evil

or the problem?

1

MR. SPAETH:

Well, if I can confine myself to answer

2

your question, first of all, solely to the record.

3

Dakota the state treasury became aware of liquor being shipped

4

off base and used by people off the premises and being

5

distributed to other individuals who are not authorized to

6

have it.

7

managed to get enough liquor off the base to actually supply a

8

complete liquor store within Hawaii.

9

In North

In the State of Hawaii one enterprising person

In the State of

♦Washington, enough liquor was shipped to one particular

10

military enclave where, if it were to be consumed on base,

11

each individual would have had to consume five bottles per

12

day, every day of the year.

13

around —

14

QUESTION:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. SPAETH:

And anyone who has ever been

Is that supposed to tax our credibility?

Well, anybody who has been around military

17

bases knows that there is a little bit of drinking that goes

18

on, but I think that is more than — than its share.

19

is precisely what this regulation is designed to do.

20

QUESTION:

And that

Does the record show that the labeling

21

requirement is what caused the out of state suppliers to stop

22

supplying liquor to the government?

23

MR. SPAETH:

No, it does not.

There is, however, of

24

course, a chronological link because once the labeling

25

requirement went into effect, several suppliers indicated that

1

they would prefer to supply through the regular distribution

2

system.

3

anyway, and others said we are going to supply it, but it is

4

going to cost you more.

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Others said that they would go ahead and supply it

Do you think you could require the federal

government to affix the labels?
MR. SPAETH:

That would be certainly more problematical

8

then, because that would be an effort to directly regulate

9

within the military enclave, and prior cases of this Court

10

have not allowed states that kind of discretion.

11

this is a special case in the sense that the Twenty-first

12

Amendment interacts in this particular situation.

13

the Court hasn't tread on that ground before, it would be a,

14

certainly a more difficult case for me were I to argue that.

15

I brought some labels with me so that the Court could

So although

16

see what they are.

17

peel kind of labels, like bumper stickers.

18

then you affix them to the bottle like that.

19

three cents or five cents, in that range, to produce.

state generates no revenue from them —

QUESTION:

These are 16 labels.

They are crack-andPeel them off and
They cost about
The

Can they be — may I just ask, you're

22

worrying about the — having somebody — an officer buy so

23

much liquor he could open his own liquor store, he could peel

24

off these labels pretty easily, couldn't he?

25

MR. SPAETH:

No, you can't.

I don't know —

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. SPAETH:

4

Can you peel it off the podium there?

My apologies to the Marshal.

I don't

think I can.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. SPAETH:

But if there is anybody who has ever

7

participated in a political campaign knows, as I have, the

8

worst — the hardest thing to get people to put on, or to

9

identify with you, is a bumper sticker, because it is very

10

difficult to get off.

11

tear it off without leaving at least part of it on.

12

is why this particular kind of label was chosen for this

13

purpose.

QUESTION:

15

burdensome requirement?

16
17

MR. SPAETH:

And the same thing here.

You can't
And that

Do you take the position that it is not a

No.

Excuse me, yes, I do take the

position it is not a burdensome requirement.

18

QUESTION:

Well, then why couldn't the state just

19

require all of the liquor sold in its stores to have the

20

sticker that it was sold in the stores?

21

government would not be impeded and you could accomplish your

22

goal.

23

MR. SPAETH:

And then the federal

Well, that wouldn't help us with respect

24

to identifying liquor that is sold on the base versus liquor

25

that might be brought in from Minnesota.

In other words, it

1

is possible, in a border state like North Dakota, that liquor

2

could wind up in the state that was purchased in Minnesota.

3

And while the position you — offer just has some merit, it

4

wouldn't enable us to distinguish liquor brought in from

5

Minnesota or Montana or South Dakota from liquor that was

6

brought off the bases, where tax was not collected.

7

don't think approaching it the reverse way would help us.

8

9

QUESTION:

So, I

Does the state have any regulatory interest

in liquor brought in from Minnesota?

Doesn't it have the same

10

regulatory interest, or is the tax — or is that not a problem

11

because the price is high?

12

MR. SPAETH:

It is not a problem because the prices are

13

roughly equivalent, because again they go through their

14

regular state distribution system and taxes are collected on

15

that liquor.

16

QUESTION:

Well, what you are saying is you don't need

17

the stickers because the market takes the place of it there.

18

I don't understand — now I don't understand your answer to

19

the hypothetical.

20

liquor that was sold through your own distributors, that would

21

take care of all the problem, because it is too expensive to

22

bring it in from Minnesota.

23

MR. SPAETH:

If you — if you required labels on all

I am sorry, Justice Stevens.

I don't

24

quite understand your question, but I'll try to answer it.

25

There is a substantial price difference between liquor sold on

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SPAETH:

4

I understand.
-- and liquor sold in North Dakota, in

Minnesota, in Montana and in South Dakota.

5

QUESTION:

I understand, but there is no similar price

6

differential between the Minnesota liquor and the North Dakota

7

liquor.

8

MR. SPAETH:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And therefore, i*f you required all North

10

Dakota wholesalers and retailers to spend the three cents for

11

these stickers on their liquor, anything that didn't have it

12

would either be from Minnesota or from the base.

13

MR. SPAETH:

14

QUESTION:

That is right.
And presumably, it wouldn't be from

15

Minnesota because it doesn't save any money to get it from

16

Minnesota.

17

it wouldn't have a sticker on it.

18

So you would then identify the base liquor because

MR. SPAETH:

The difficulty we have, though, is one of

19

the two military enclaves we are talking about here is located

20

in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and I am not — I don't know

21

your familiarity with North Dakota geography, but that sits

22

squarely on the border with Minnesota.

23

liquor in North Dakota from Minnesota, and we'd have lots of

24

it, because of sales or whatever features that may cause

25

people to purchase across the — the border.

And we would have

So there still

is a bootlegging problem that is dealt with by using these

labels.
QUESTION:

I'm really, I don't — aren't there

Minnesota tax stamps on the Minnesota liquor?

There are not.

And so we do have an

In any event, if you look at it

10

simply from the standpoint of practicalities, this is probably

11

the least intrusive thing the State of North Dakota could have

12

done to deal with what it perceived to be a major problem.

13

QUESTION:

General Spaeth, one of the affidavits

14

submitted on behalf of the government indicated that one out-

15

of-state wholesaler said he was going to have to raise his

16

price something like $20 a case if this requirement went into

17

effect.

18

on the label, than we might guess, or is this just a rather

19

extravagant estimate, in your view?

20

Are there more costs connected with it, the putting

MR. SPAETH:

I think it is a rather extravagant

21

estimate.

22

pennies each.

23

is hard to believe it would cost that much money to affix

24

these labels.

25

I mean, the labels themselves only cost a couple of
And unless their labor costs are enormous, it

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question.

The

1

posture of the case is that the district court granted summary

2

judgment for the state; the Eighth Circuit reversed and

3

granted summary judgment for the United States.

4

MR. SPAETH:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

That is correct.
So if there were any triable issue in fact

in the case, both courts were wrong, in effect.
MR. SPAETH:

That is right, although both sides

8

stipulated to most of the essential facts in this case.

9

— it's really not a case where there is a real quibble over

10

the factual record.

11

from the factual record.

12

QUESTION:

So it

It is rather the inferences to be drawn

Well, I think there is a disagreement among

you as to whether there is a "burden" or not.
14

MR. SPAETH:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That is correct.
And I am not so sure that isn't a factual

question.
MR. SPAETH:

And, it could be, in some sense of the

18

word, because obviously the federal government is arguing that

19

it is extremely burdensome to comply with this requirement,

20

and the state is arguing to the contrary.

21

QUESTION:

I — I take it the $20 a case figure could

22

include also the substantial cost of having to keep separate

23

inventories in the warehouse of the stickered and the non-

24

stickered liquor.

25

before it is put in the box and well before it is shipped.

Because the stickers are put on, I assume,

2

3

MR. SPAETH:

That's correct.

It could account for some

of that cost to go, again -QUESTION:

And of course, if your view prevails, you

4

can have every state requiring stickers and then the distiller

5

would have to keep 49 separate inventories.

6

7
8

9

MR. SPAETH:

Unless the states got together and agreed

on a sample labeling procedure, that is correct.
The state doesn't attempt, of course, to regulate sales
on the base in any other way.

None of this liquor is taxed.

10

The bases operate at different hours than liquor stores within

11

the state, and sell to any classes, individuals, it wants to

You have to

The state believed it had the authority to impose this

16

labeling requirement because of its inherent police powers,

17

and also because of its core powers within the Twenty-first

18

Amendment.

19

exactly what this Court suggested that we do in United States

20

v. Mississippi Tax Commission, when the Court alluded to the

21

fact that the states were free, of course, to regulate the

22

shipments of liquor en route to bases in order to prevent

23

diversion.

Indeed we thought in doing this we were doing

innocuous regulation, and our belief that it was firmly rooted

That is correct.

But that is because —

That is a big difference.
Well, it is a difference, but it is a

17

discrimination in favor of the federal government, because

18

every other distributor has to pay the tax and go through the

19

whole distribution network, be licensed and be bonded.

20

exactly like the situation this Court endorsed in United

QUESTION:

MR. SPAETH:

The tax isn't collected; the suppliers

They just have to label.
They just have to label.

It is far less

10

onerous than what other distributors have to do within the

state.

Go which route?

18

MR. SPAETH:

I don't think that the state could require

19

the federal enclaves to buy it through the distribution

20

system, but I do think the state, if it wanted to, could tax

21

those suppliers before they sell the liquor to the base.

22

Indeed, the court in the United States v. Mississippi said the

23

states could do that, and in the case I just cited to you,

24

United States v. the State of Washington, the Court said you

25

could do that.

You could tax contractors or suppliers to the

discriminatory way.

QUESTION:

We are doing far less than that here --

Is that true if the supplier — that's not

true if the suppliers are out of state.
MR. SPAETH:

Well, they are in state, though, for the

6

purpose of doing business, in the sense that they are selling

7

to locations within the state.

8

and Roebuck is in the state in the sense that it sells within

9

the state.

10
11

I mean, that, just as Sears

And I don't think it is any different than

situations this Court has endorsed in other cases.
The court of appeals also thought in this case that

12

there might be federal preemption.

13

that requires the federal government to purchase liquor from

14

the competitive source, price and other factors considered,

15

and a regulation that basically parroted the statute.

It is

16

difficult for me to see how that could be preemption.

First

17

of all, there is no express statement in either the statute or

18

regulation that any state rules or regulations are preempted.

19

Certainly this is not an area where Congress has occupied the

20

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The military's procurement of alcoholic beverages has

21

generated its share of controversy ever since the Congress, in

22

1802, included one gill, which is four ounces, of rum, whiskey

23

or brandy in a soldier's daily ration.

with federal law, may remain free to purchase its alcoholic

2

from the most convenient and inexpensive sources, regardless

3

of whether those sources are located in a base's home state.

4

In our view the states regulations are constitutionally

5

invalid for three principal reasons.

6

clear in Section 2488 of Title 10 that the military must

7

remain free to buy its alcoholic beverages at the lowest

8

available price, regardless of where the suppliers and/or

9

distillers are located.

First, Congress has made

Here the record shows that North

10

Dakota's regulatory efforts conflict with this federal scheme,

11

actually thwart it, and thus violate the Supremacy Clause.

12

The regulations would in effect require the military to obtain

13

its liquor for its North Dakota facilities from less

14

competitive in-state sources, and on this record, at an

15

increased annual cost of more than $200,000.

of fact, don't you think, Mr. Lazerwitz?
MR. LAZERWITZ:

That is clearly an issue of fact, and

19

in this case there was an uncontroverted affidavit from Kim

Spaeth said, bootlegging, the sale — the resale of untaxed

liquor.

whether it is bought from out-of-state sources or whether

4

bought from licensed wholesalers in the state, will always be

5

cheaper from liquor off the base in North Dakota.

6

not only because of the source, but because liquor sold to the

7

servicemen on the base is not subject to a retail tax.

8

Therefore, under the state's own terms, there is always going

to be the potential — potential for diversion, of

Assuming that's a problem, liquor on military bases,

here, the state doesn't impose any labeling requirement for

But what happens

I suppose that also there is probably not as

the federal government ever required the bases to label the

MR. LAZERWITZ:

12

Oh, I don't want to downplay the

13

competitive advantages of military procurement, but I just

14

don't want to leave the Court with the impression that we had

15

a simple option of just raising prices.

The fact of the

16

matter is, the military got very smart.

It used to buy

17

liquor, a lot of liquor, in-state from the distributors and

paid the additional mark up that is the result of the local

tax.

So you actually have a financial interest in

having the state law violated, in the way they are complaining

about it.

9

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, no, we don't, Justice Stevens,

10

and there are some practical concerns.

11

and we don't want — and military bases are in communities and

12

in states, and the last thing the military wants is for state

13

governments to yell and complain that the military is running

14

a bootleg operation, because that is going to affect how it

does its business.

MR. LAZERWITZ:

are set up, they don't, they could care less.

Because in fact

QUESTION:

Yeah, but they — so, do they think this is

really going to be an effective way of curing their problem?

Because, after all — all the label does is repeat what is in

the military law —

MR. LAZERWITZ:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Well, I —

— don't sell off the base, don't use off

the base.
MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, one curious aspect of this case,

12

and I am not sure it's my province to get into, but the only,

13

if you read North Dakota:'s laws, there is no law that says

14

it's illegal to consume liquor off the base.

15

cited in this case, and it is actually by the amicus briefs,

16

is that provision of the administrative code saying that all

17

liquor imported into the state must be imported through a

18

licensed wholesaler.

19

illegal for a serviceman to have untaxed liquor off base.

20

can't dispute that, if that is what the state is now saying.

21

But there are no penalties if —

22

QUESTION:

The only law

Now, the state tells us that it is
We

Well, do you think there — I would think, I

23

would think if this — putting on this label is not an

effective way of curing the problem they want to cure, that

you would argue that.

there is a problem.

2

way of curing it?

3

Do you think the labeling is an effective

MR. LAZERWITZ:

The labeling would be -- no, it is an

4

incomplete way, and it is an incomplete way for the reason I

5

gave before.

6

-- we do buy, just for the Court's information, in North

7

Dakota we do buy some liquor from in-state sources.

8

buy all of it from our warehouse, it is not all shipped to our

9

warehouse.

The state doesn't require any labeling for those

We don't

And so the reason it is an ineffective requirement

10

is there is no label on those — on those, first of all, on

11

the beer and wine.

12

And it is always going to be cheaper on the base.

13

QUESTION:

There is no label on the beer and wine.

But for the state to think this is going to

14

cure their problem, somebody has to read the label and say

15

gee, I had better obey what this label says.

16

MR. LAZERWITZ:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Well, the servicemen are told —

But that is no different than what the

military already requires.
MR. LAZERWITZ:

We tell the servicemen that we'll sell

20

it to you, but if you take it off the base you are subject to

21

state law.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I guess the state wants to be able to

23

identify these bottles off base, if they should come across a

24

cache of liquor in a barn.

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Oh, sure, or —

QUESTION:

1

For example, say ah ha, this is untaxed

2

liquor, I see these little orange labels on it which you can't

3

get off.

4

to identify the bottles —

5

I assume that that is the purpose of it, isn't it,

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Yes, and also — I mean, the example

6

cited in Washington where someone was essentially selling to

7

another liquor store.

8

could walk through a liquor store, go through the inventory

9

and say well, there is no label on this, where did you get it

10
11

You could — a state liquor inspector

from?
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose it is also not implausible

12

to assume that the sticker requirement is so burdensome that

13

you will have to buy through the local wholesaler.

14

MR. LAZERWITZ:

It certainly — anyone who knows the

15

liquor business would know that you would.

Justice Kennedy alluded to it before.

21

And I'll — I can

The labels, of course,

A lot of liquor comes directly

It is packaged overseas.

If the — if the distiller, it's actually the importer,

22

has to break down the liquor once it comes here — he doesn't

23

care about the labels.

24

of the way he normally does his business is just ship it to

25

whichever state or ever local distributor he is going to.

It's the labor of doing this, instead

so I don't think it takes any leap of faith to understand why

2

five of our prime source distributors said we are not going to

3

do business with you any more.

4

do business but we are going to raise our prices.

And one said well, we'll still

And another curious aspect of the case is we will —

6

the distributors and why they don't file their amicus brief,

7

or why they are not here, we are going to still buy their

8

liquor.

9

from Somerset Importers; we're just not going to be buying it

We are still going to be buying Johnnie Walker Black

10

directly from the shop.

11

Somerset Importers outlets in North Dakota.

12

Importers says fine with us.

13

under federal law the price differential from a distiller to a

14

local importer is uniform.
QUESTION:

15
16

So Somerset

And that is the problem, because

Do you feel you may need amicus briefs to

win this case?

18

We're going to be buying it from

MR. LAZERWITZ:

At times I did, but I don't think --the

government can stand on its own briefs and its own arguments.
Just one final point because the state does rely

19
20

principally on the Twenty-first Amendment.

Again, we have no

21

quarrels with the idea that the state can take all sorts of

22

measures to police trafficking of liquor within their borders.

23

But that is not this case because, even as Mr. Spaeth

24

suggested, what they really concerned is what happens on the

25

base.

And that is not something the Twenty-first Amendment

gives them the authority to do.

Off the base, that's a

2

different matter.

3

is something that they can't do, and those are the Mississippi

cases.

But on the base and the federal procurement

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

MR. SPAETH:

10

I think the Court understands the case,

11

but I thought I would follow up on a couple of points that

12

came up and perhaps the Court is also in doubt about the

13

answer.

15

who is accumulating large quantities of liquor for

16

bootlegging, and they are subject, in that case, to —

But you don't think it is going to add — be

18

a deterrent effect to — I mean, somebody reads that label and

19

says I should —

20

MR. SPAETH:

No.

If they want to, if they are going to

21

bootleg it off the base this isn't going to help.

22

not going to help in typical situations where someone takes

23

one or two bottles off the base.

QUESTION:

through a wholesaler?
MR. SPAETH:

2

It depends on — on how we find them.

If

3

we found someone with simply one or two bottles, we'd — we

4

would not prosecute.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SPAETH:

My office —

Well, is there a violation?
There could be.

If we were to prove that

7

that person took — intended then to redistribute it or resell

8

it, that would be in violation of a host of state laws which

9

impose criminal penalties as well as civil penalties.

10

criminal penalty is a Class A misdemeanor.

11
12

The

QUESTION:

So the penalties we are talking about is

possession of liquor for resale?

13

MR. SPAETH:

That is correct.

We would have to prove,

14

of course, in the case of a single bottle, that they intended

15

to do that, and undoubtedly we wouldn't prosecute in that

16

case.

concerned more with the situation where its large quantities

But that is not what we are concerned about.

We are

Isn't there some rule you're not supposed to

be in possession of untaxed liquor in -MR. SPAETH:

No, we don't have a possession rule.

But

23

we do have a rule, a law that prohibits possession with intent

24

to resell.

regulations are designed to do.

QUESTION:

1

General Spaeth, I had two questions.

First,

2

in view of the colloquy with your adversary, and you mentioned

3

this, three cents a label, it is fairly clear, is it not, that

4

if the wholesaler has to un, open up all these cartons and

5

stick the labels on individual bottles, it is a substantial

6

burden in labeling.

7
8

MR. SPAETH:

I don't know if it is substantial, but it

is more than three cents a bottle.

9

QUESTION:

It is a lot more if you have to open — I

10

mean just opening a liquor case takes a little work, you know,

11

and it's — and then getting each bottle —
MR. SPAETH:

12

13

but it could be more burdensome.

14

(Laughter.)

15

QUESTION:

16

I don't know, I don't buy it by the case,

And so that is what we are talking about, is

that?

17

MR. SPAETH:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

That is what we are talking about.

And the second thing, is there — maybe you

19

have answered it, I just wasn't entirely clear.

Does North

20

Dakota require any kind of stamp on the bottle on which the

21

tax is paid?

Is there anything — evidence it does?

22

MR. SPAETH:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SPAETH:

25

QUESTION:

No, there is no labeling requirement.
Don't many states do that?
Some states do, but many states do not.
Yeah.

MR. SPAETH:

The last point I wanted to address, and

2

then if there are any questions I will answer them, is the

3

dispute we are having with the government about whether we

4

could tax or not.

5

to quotes, but if you look at your case United States v.

6

Mississippi State Tax Commission, 421 U.S. at 613-614, the

7

Court does say that nothing in the language of the Twenty-

8

first Amendment leads to the extraordinary conclusion that the

9

amendment abolished federal immunity with respect to sales,

And I know the Court doesn't like to listen

10

but it does, certainly does not say anything — excuse me, I

11

am misreading it.

12

you know, that is clear based on a whole line of cases that

13

this Court has declared.

There is the ability to tax, and I think,

Are there any more questions?
