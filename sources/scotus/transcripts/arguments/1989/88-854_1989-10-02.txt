ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. HARMON, JR.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HARMON:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

There, there is no question but in this case of the

13

federal government has the power to squash the City of

14

Yonkers.

15

through fronts and not through proxies.

16

responsibility in so doing, the exercise of their own power.

17

No federal court, not even in the civil rights movements of

18

the 1960s has ever found the need to ask and direct a

19

legislator to cast his vote in favor of enactment of

20

legislation at the price of his own conscience and the cost of

21

his freedom.

22

things.

23

When our federal courts act, they act directly, not
They accept the

That, I submit, is just not the way that we do

The Solicitor General argues for a government in which

24

the judiciary is supreme, a judiciary which drafts laws,

25

directs their enactsment -- enactment, interprets them, and

presumably holds people accountable for their violation.

2

is just this type of concentration of power that the -- that

3

the Constitution avoids in many different ways.

QUESTION:

You think the -- you're arguing for

legislative immunity, local legislative immunity?
MR. HARMON:

6

As well as First Amendment, Your Honor,

7

and the discretion inherent in the Court to fashion a

8

constitutional remedy and the limitations on the Court in

9

fashioning such a remedy.

QUESTION:

MR. HARMON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HARMON:

14

Do you think you need all of those?
We think the Court could —
What about just the immunity question?
We think the Court could decide this on

that basis, yes, Your Honor.

No, it is not, Your Honor.
So, it is just a construction of some other

Which some statute wasn't intended to

interfere with?

MR. HARMON:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So, Congress could deprive the legislators

of their common-law immunity?

MR. HARMON:

That is not correct, Your Honor.

It is a

question of federal common law, and we think that is the whole

6

QUESTION:

Well, if that is all it is, then can

Congress change that?
MR. HARMON:

It, it, it cannot, Your Honor.

It would

7

be our position that for Congress to do that would interfere

8

with the rights of the states, guaranteed through the

9

guarantee clause to establish --

10
11

QUESTION:

So, you are relying on a constitutional

basis, not merely a common law immunity?

12

MR. HARMON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HARMON:

Yes, Your Honor.
You are relying on the guarantee clause?
Yes, Your Honor, although the cases, both

15

Tenney and Lake Tahoe Estates, do not — explain in any detail

16

the extent to which Congress could interfere with the

17

operation of legislative immunity.

18

Congress would take action once the state has selected its

19

particular form of republican government, that this would

20

interfere with the federal government's obligation --

21

QUESTION:

We submit that if the

Well, why do you need to get into that

22

rather difficult question in this case, Mr. Harmon, if, if

23

your argument is basically legislative immunity?

24

not acted, at least that is your position I take it, to, to

25

remove legislative immunity.

Congress has

Why don't you settle for that

1

rather than trying to raise the hypothetical question of what

2

happens if Congress did try?

3

MR. HARMON:

Well, I think I as best I could was

4

answering the question about whether or not Congress could

5

intervene, and in, in answering the question I was giving our

6

position in the event that Congress had — has intervened.

7

But, but, but we do believe that this issue can be

8

resolved simply by extending the principle in Lake Tahoe

9

Estates to local legislators.

The whole purpose behind

10

legislative immunity was to protect our form of representative

11

government.

12

immunity and this Court has -- has accepted the principle as

13

applied to state legislators and, in the Lake Tahoe Estates

14

case, to those regional legislators.

15

said in his dissent in that particular case, there really was

16

no particular argument that could be advanced to deny its

17

application to local legislators in this, in this particular

18

case.

19

That was the entire idea behind legislative

And as Justice Marshall

However, Your Honor, we also deal in this case not only

20

with the issue of legislative immunity, but with the Court's

21

power and the extent of the Court's power to remedy a

22

constitutional violation, and we would say also the obligation

23

of the Court to remedy a constitutional violation.

24

suggest to the Court that there -- that there is an underlying

25

principle underlying our First Amendment argument, the use of

We'd

1

the contempt power, as well as the Court's obligation to

2

remedy a constitutional violation.

3

And it would be, this we would suggest, that it is the

4

obligation of the courts to provide a measured exercise of

5

their power in remedying a constitutional violation, taking

6

into account the rights of those who are not before the court.

7

And we respectfully suggest, Your Honor, that in this

8

particular case, this Court used the most intrusive means when

9

it came to the personal rights of the councilmen and when it

10

came to their legislative immunity.

11

QUESTION:

Do you think that legislators, if they enjoy

12

immunity, can waive it?

13

MR. HARMON:

14

that in its, in its brief.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

The government has made no effort to argue

Well, I asked you whether you thought it

could be waived if there is such a privilege?
MR. HARMON:

The answer is we do not believe that an

18

individual legislator can waive the privilege.

19

believe that the legislature itself can waive the privilege,

20

because it is designed to protect our form of government.

21

is designed to protect our representative form of government.

22

And it cannot be waived by an individual and it cannot be

23

waived by the institution of the legislature, because in the

24

final analysis, it is there to protect the right of the people

25

to select those who they would have to represent them.

What is the effect, then, of the city

It has no effect whatsoever on the rights

position, however, that the city is bound by whatever

6

commitments it made in the, in the consent decree.

individual legislators, nonetheless, still retain their First

No, there have been no developers even

QUESTION:

6

MR. HARMON:

In, in, in fact, and I -Yes or no?
Yes.
And that is not more intrusive?
It can do it to this extent, Your Honor.

7

It can do what it did already once in this case, which I just

8

became aware of Friday and which I advised Mr. Starr a short

9

while ago.

It can enter an order to the effect that the

10

zoning in Yonkers is deemed to permit a certain type of

11

housing in a, in a certain part of Yonkers.

12

Although the briefs don't reflect this, and this is

13

again not a question of second guessing the district court, on

14

March 20, 1987 with respect to public housing, the district

15

court in fact did enter an order deeming that Yonkers zoning

16

permitted the construction of this public housing.

17

last Thursday, the government attorneys appeared before Judge

18

Sand and asked him to do the very same thing with respect to

19

five additional sites.

Now, in doing that, Your Honor, it does not implicate

really was important here, and what really was important, as

2

Your Honor has, has pointed out, is to figure out a way and to

3

get moving with respect to building housing in some fashion.

4

Turning toward the councilmen, using means that only

5

left them as targets at the end of, of the line, we submit

missed the point and, and, and, and was a case of using

7

intrusive means that did not point towards the accomplishment

of the objective.

QUESTION:

What about raising the money?

Do you think

10

the court could say I deem that the council has passed a tax

measure, or a bond issue, has approved a bond issue for this

purpose --

MR. HARMON:

QUESTION:

Well, in, in this particular case —
-- and then order the executive branch to

carry it out?

gotten to that particular point.

QUESTION:

But it will.

It hasn't

How's the court going to do

it?
MR. HARMON:

It is -- there is a difference between

22

directing an executive act, in our opinion, and, and directing

23

an act which is purely legislative.

24

to levy a tax, which we believe would be a legislative act and

25

something that a court simply could not do.

It is one thing to levy,

That -- that --

1

that's not to say that in this case, or even -- or even in

2

this one, Your Honor, that a court would be powerless to act.

3

We think that, that courts do not have only the

4

authority which is not barred to them, but there are limits on

5

the court's authority, and the courts must act within those

6

particular limits.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

How is the court going to effectively

produce the money to get the houses built, the housing built?
MR. HARMON:

In, in this particular case there is a

10

combination of market incentives encouraging developers to

11

come in and granting tax abatements.

12

has been chosen in, in this particular case.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

That is the method that

Well, I suppose there is some -- there are

some things that maybe a court just cannot bring about.
MR. HARMON:

We think that the court's power is limited

16

by the constitutional grant of its power, and it is the

17

responsibility of courts to, to say what the law is, and to

18

levy a tax is not an exercise of, of the judicial power.

19

There may be other ways, though.

20

QUESTION:

Well, if, if, if you stipulate that the city

21

has violated the Constitution, would you say that the court

22

can use all appropriate means to require the city to remedy

23

that violation?

24
25

MR. HARMON:

All appropriate means within its power,

taking into account the rights of persons who are not before

2

QUESTION:

All right.

And if all of the expertise and

3

the ability to raise funds and so forth resides within the

4

city council, I take it an ultimate and permitted and

5

appropriate sanction would be a monetary fine against the City

6

of New York for failure to act -- or against the -- the City

7

of Yonkers for failure to act?

10
11

12

MR. HARMON:

We, we, we would suggest that the contempt

power be a, a matter of last resort, and that there would be
some -QUESTION:

But that that would be appropriate, monetary

fine, as was imposed in this case against the city?

13

MR. HARMON:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Then, if you --

But not against the individual?

16

MR. HARMON:

QUESTION:

But not against the individual, right.
Then what you are really arguing,

if you

18

have recalcitrant councilmen who, let us assume, it may not be

19

this case, for their own political advantage, refuse to comply

20

with the court order, you are saying that there is a right in

21

the city councilmen to force the city to go bankrupt?

22

MR. HARMON:

There is a, a right in councilmen to

23

exercise their judgment, to take into account the wishes of

24

their constituents, to take into account their own -- their

25

own conscience -12

QUESTION:

is what they conclude?

MR. HARMON:

And to force the city to go bankrupt if that

Yes, and to be held accountable for that

at the ballot box, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

I have some trouble with looking to the

6

wishes of the constituents, because it seems to me the basic

7

issue in the case is whether the court can order something the

8

constituents don't want.

9

followed the appropriate procedure it could order this housing

10

to be built, notwithstanding the fact that constituents really

11

don't want it.

MR. HARMON:

QUESTION:

I think you assume that if it

That is —
How can we use the constituents as the test

14

of what can be permitted?

15

MR. HARMON:

Well, we don't suggest for, for a minute

16

that there is a question of majoritarianism here, that the

17

majority -- that the majority should rule, Your Honor.

suggest, however, that the wishes of constituents is simply

19

one of the things that our representative form of government

permits elected officials and legislators to take into account

QUESTION:

Even when it violates a, a superior federal

law.

If there is a federal statute or a federal requirement

24

that these houses be built, how does -- how do the local

majority of the constituents' views come into the play at all?

1

MR. HARMON:

Well, we respectfully suggest that that is

2

precisely the problem that has been posed here by the district

3

court, that this Court is being put in the position of

4

deciding which, which rights should be superior.

5

QUESTION:

But aren't you — don't you start here from

6

the premise that there is a federal violation that the court

7

has the power by appropriate means to correct?

8

MR. HARMON:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, Your Honor.
Notwithstanding the fact that the

constituents are very much opposed to it.

11

MR. HARMON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So don't -- aren't the views of the

13

constituents necessarily subordinate to the court's power to

14

fashion an appropriate remedy?

15

whether this is an appropriate remedy.

16

MR. HARMON:

And the only question is

Well, they may -- they may be subordinate,

17

Your Honor, but we, as we pointed out in our brief, we -- we'd

18

suggest that the views of the constituents, since this was a

19

class action, were views that should have been brought to the

20

attention of the district court.

21

there was no hearing, there was no fairness hearing before the

22

court accepted this particular form of consent decree.

23

Yes, in the final analysis the court could have

There was no notice here,

QUESTION:

Mr. Harmon, I have some, some misgivings

3

about — extending the speech or debate clause in the federal

4

Constitution, not only to state legislatures but even to

5

state, city councils.

6

that, that city councils by and large are responsible enough

7

that they should be given the full protection of the speech or

8

debate clause, which, after all, prevents even a libel action

9

against, you know, the most terrible libels uttered in, in the

What if the state itself doesn't think

course of the debates.

11

know our city councilmen and by and large they are not a

responsible enough lot that we are going to — we, we are

13

going to immunize them to go about slandering the whole world

14

like that.

15

Constitution protects these city councils against libel

action, is that what you are saying?

You have a state who says you know, we

No, but you are arguing on the base of

for libel.

You would say that is an unconstitutional statute,

2

that the majesty of the federal Constitution prevents city

3

councilmen from libel actions.

MR. HARMON:

5

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, we would -Well, then you are not arguing the speech or

debate clause.

7

the Constitution that says that courts can enact legislation

8

that isn't the speech or debate clause.

Now, maybe there is some other principle in

Court's decision in Wise against Lipscomb, which is cited in

It is not a particularly good.

However, it

That's — that's more like — if the court

That order did not say here is an ordinance

Was there a claim there, to your knowledge,

MR. STARR:

There was none.

I would respectfully urge

the Court to reject the applicability of that doctrine here.

Doesn't that scare you a little bit, too?
It gives me great pause because of

principles of federalism.

I would be gravely concerned with a

7

federal court order to a state legislature.

8

of, and it is done, but that raises more profound questions of

9

federalism and comity than it does to a local council which

exists by virtue of the New York State Constitution.

QUESTION:

I am not worried about federalism.

I am

worried about, about what a court is and what a court can do.

14

Can a court act as a legislature, state or federal, it doesn't

matter to me.

16

MR. STARR:

It is more troubling and it is, indeed, in

17

this case, one of the reasons that the district court said

18

instead of my acting as a legislature as they now suggest he

19

should have done, he said instead I am going to use a

20

traditional power, the contempt power, to enforce an

21

obligation and which will, in fact, result in no restructuring

22

whatsoever of the local governmental apparatus in Yonkers.

23

That, in my judgment, was a very restrained remedy and,

indeed, this Court, Justice O'Connor in her dissent, in the

Civil contempt, that is important; this is not a

QUESTION:

But civil contempt is a time honored,

Well, if we concede, General Starr, that the

Constitution of the United States, because of its separation

9

of powers scheme would prevent our ordering Congress from

10

voting for a certain act, that is not because it is just a

11

guirk of the constitutional structure.

12

are some very basic concerns we have about demarcation of the

13

lines of political responsibility.

14

those same concerns are not abundantly present here, and why

15

just as a matter of controlling the court's discretion as

being a wise or an unwise use of discretion, all of those

considerations aren't applicable to the city council.

10

for them to have a city council meeting, to have a hearing, to

MR. STARR:

The outcome in a broad sense is foreclosed

greater latitude to the council to send it back to them,

of this record suggests that we never reached the point of
