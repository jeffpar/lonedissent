ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

11

MS. EPPLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The case presented for review today concerns two

12

central issues:

13

statute as facially challenged ensure a minor's rights to

14

due process under the Fourteenth Amendment; and second,

15

does the Constitution require the state to provide a

16

bypass procedure for a pregnant minor seeking to avoid

17

parental notification.

18

First, does Ohio's parental•notification

The cardinal principle in our nation's laws is that

19

states are entitled to enact laws designed to aid parents

20

in discharging their responsibilities for the upbringing

21

of their children.

22

has a significant interest in encouraging an unmarried

23

pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents

24

in making the grave decision of whether or not to bear a

25

child.

This Court has recognized that a state

1

This right has specifically been extended to permit

2

states to allow parental consent for a minor seeking to

3

have an abortion performed, provided that an expedient and

4

confidential alternative to consent is provided for a

5

mature minor or a minor whose best interest would not be

served.

7

justify parental consent, certainly they are strong enough

8

to support also parental notification.

If the state's interests are strong enough to

valuable information to physicians, including information

about medical history, psychological history, data

14

available to the minor or, if available, may not be

that there is proper treatment and care in the event that

post-operative complications arise, be that in the — in

22

the nature of physical complications or emotional.

Ohio's requirement of parental notification is

24

clearly no more burdensome than a consent provision and

their children while preserving the minor's right to

2

choose.

3

Ohio has adopted a parental notification statute that

4

contains a judicial bypass procedure modeled on the

5

guidelines provided by this Court in Bellotti II.

6

the lower courts have acknowledged that Ohio has the right

7

and the authority to legislate parental involvement, they

8

nonetheless struck down Ohio's statute based on judicially

9

manufactured flaws.

10

While

In a facial challenge to a legislative act, this

Court has given clear guidance on the rules of statutory

The challenger must establish that no set

19

constitutional difficulties such that if one among

20

alternative constructions would provide for an

21

unconstitutional interpretation, then that particular

22

interpretation should be rejected in favor of another.

23

The lower courts here have failed to adhere to these

24

fundamental principles of statutory construction when

25

analyzing Ohio's statute presented for review.

Specifically, the judicial bypass provisions provide a

QUESTION:

What about the clear and convincing

evidence standard that's required?
MS. EPPLER:

Your Honor, the clear and convincing

11

standard of proof here does, in fact, provide for an

12

ability — since the parents are not going to be

13

represented at the hearing, the state has decided not to

14

turn this into an adversarial type process, so the state

15

is not represented, and there needs to be in this

16

nonadversarial ex parte type of proceeding some way to

17

assure a reliable result in the outcome.

20

QUESTION:

Well, what test do you apply?

The

Mathews/Eldridge test?
MS. EPPLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

When analyzing the

21

three-part test laid out in Mathews v. Eldridge,

22

specifically we first look to the private interest

23

affected.

25

parent and not simply the right to have an abortion ■

In this instance, it's the minor's right to

under a notification statute.

Secondly is the question of who bears the risk of an

erroneous decision.

process, the minor here is the only party and, therefore,

6

is the only party that can bear the risk.

7

Again, in an ex parte, nonadversarial

Thirdly, we look to the governmental interest or the

8

state interest affected here, and that is in encouraging a

9

pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents

10

in making this decision and in protecting the minor's

11

health.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

And what about the risk of erroneous

deprivation?
MS. EPPLER:

Your Honor, it is the state's position

15

that the risk can only here be borne by the minor since

16

she is the only party involved, based —

17
18

QUESTION:

But it increases the risk of erroneous

deprivation by increasing the burden of proof, of course.

MS. EPPLER:

20

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor, and —
And you have an unsophisticated minor,

21

presumably, trying to handle these things.

evidence would suffice?

an in-chambers conference or in a — in a in camera type

3

of proceeding before the court and will most likely simply

4

be the minor presenting her evidence with her counsel's

5

aid, and there is no reason —

We assume the evidence will go forward either in

QUESTION:

And what evidence would suffice to meet

the standard of clear and convincing?
MS. EPPLER:

Your Honor, it is the definition of

clear and convincing evidence under Ohio law that it's

10

more than a mere preponderance but not to the extent of

11

such certainty as beyond a reasonable doubt.

12

Specifically, the Ohio case is analyzing clear and

13

convincing to say it does not mean clear and

14

unequivocable.

15

So it's clearly simply more than a preponderance of

16

the evidence which, in the state's.position, is reasonable

17

in light of the fact that there is no one there to present

18

the other side of this issue.

19

In addition —

QUESTION:

21
22

Well — well, what kind of evidence does

the minor adduce to show maturity?
MS. EPPLER:

Your Honor, I — I would posit that the

23

minor would simply be able to tell her side to the judge.

24

If she believes she is sufficiently mature, most likely

25

her statements alone will suffice, and if the judge —

1

QUESTION:

Well, what sort of factors do you take

2

into account if you're a judge in order to tell if the

3

minor is mature or not?

4

MS. EPPLER:

I think the ability to answer questions

5

how well the minor is able to articulate what her

6

particular concerns are if it is a best interest question

7

If it's maturity, I think the judge in many instances in

8

juvenile proceedings have the need to assess maturity

9

level to determine the validity of a minor's claims as

14
15

they are raised before the juvenile court.
So this would not be anything different than a
juvenile judge would traditionally be required to analyze
QUESTION:

Can — can you tell us how long these

hearings usually take to determine, say, maturity?
MS. EPPLER:

Your Honor, specifically, the statute

16

provides for the juvenile level to be heard within the

17

fifth — by the fifth business day but as soon as

18

possible, but no later than the fifth business day.

21

QUESTION:

I — I meant how long does the hearing

itself take?
MS. EPPLER:

The time?

Your Honor, since this is a

22

facial challenge and we have not yet had the opportunity

23

to put the statute into play, I would simply be

24

speculating to answer your question.

25

My assumption is that the hearings would be rather

1

brief.

The decision based on the evidence presented is to

2

be provided immediately at the conclusion of the hearing

3

by statute, so that would lend credence to believe that

4

the hearing would be fairly brief in its duration.

5

In addition, the appellate level of review is

6

scheduled to take place within nine days total, four days

7

for filing the brief — four days for filing the appeal,

8

the notice of appeal, and then five days for appellate

9

review including briefing, oral argument and disposition.

10

In addition, there are good cause provisions that

11

allow for the appellate level of review to be expedited if

12

good cause is shown.

13

Consequently, this is probably one of the most —

14

clearest examples of the lower court's overreaching.

15

they did is take a nine-day time frame at appellate level

16

of review and turn it into 15 days by utilizing a

17

hypothetical situation that could in essence only occur

18

one time per calendar year and added in two weekends and

19

two legal holidays to turn nine days into 15.

20

What

It is the state's position here that the 20 — the

21

22-day time frame arrived at for determination of the

22

entire level of review would in fact be inappropriate.

23

But even assuming that the 22 days is correct, the statute

24

is still sufficiently expeditious to comply with the

25

Bellotti II standards.

1

This Court in Ashcroft looked to something akin to a

2

16- to 17-day time frame, plus an undetermined period of

3

time for deliberation and decisionmaking at both the

4

juvenile and appellate levels of review and found that to

5

be sufficiently — sufficiently expeditious.

6

In addition, the Ohio statute has the protection of a

7

constructive authorization provision that provides for the

8

minor to have a final disposition on her petition despite

9

crowded dockets or any unforeseen delays or problems with

10

the court.

11

Ohio statute cannot be delayed.

12

Disposition on the minor's petition under the

The lower courts here again speculated that

13

physicians would be unwilling to perform abortions based

14

on the constructive authorization and concluded that that

15

provision was an undue burden on the minor's rights.

16

type of speculation again has no place in a facial

17

challenge and as a factual matter is simply incorrect.

18

The Ohio courts speak through their journal.

This

There

19

is no reason why a copy of the complaint coupled with the

20

journal could not be provided to a physician to provide

21

tangible proof that constructive authorization has in fact

22

taken place.

23

In addition, since the minor is in fact represented

24

by counsel under the statute, the — the ability to have

25

an opportunity to confer with counsel to determine that

1

the constructive authorization has taken place also exists

2

for the physician.

3
4
5

So to assume that the constructive authorization will
create an undue burden.
So to assume that the constructive authorization

6

will create an undue burden is another clear example of

7

the lower court's failure to follow this Court's maxims on

8

statutory construction.

9

With regard to the statute's provisions and the

10

Ohio ethics laws governing the conduct of court employees,

11

they both combine to assure the confidentially of the

12

bypass proceeding.

13

The statute specifically prohibits the minor's

14

parents from being notified of the proceeding.

15

hearings at both the juvenile and appellate levels of

16

review must be conducted to preserve anonymity.

17

papers and records at both the juvenile and appellate

18

levels of review are specifically to be kept confidential,

19

and are exempt from the Ohio Public Records Law that would

20

allow disclosure to the public.

21

The

All

In addition, the Ohio ethics laws subject court

22

personnel who violate the confidentiality of these

23

proceedings to criminal sanctions and fines, including

24

imprisonment as well.

4

If she is represented by

While the form does require the name and

5
6

addresses of the minor's parents, that is no different

7

than the requirements of the — of the consent statute

8

that was examined by this Court in Planned Parenthood

9

Association v. Ashcroft.
In Ashcroft, while the minor was permitted to

10
11

use her initials and had the ability to have the petition

12

signed by a next friend, she still was required to provide

13

the name and address of her parents.

14

The Ohio statute here provides a proper

15

framework to preserve the confidentiality of the

16

proceedings.

17

articulate how the statute would endanger the anonymity of

18

the minor.

19

The lower courts here have failed to

The plaintiffs here irrationally predict that

20

court personnel facing criminal sanctions will cavalierly

21

disregard the minor's rights.

22

and prediction, again, have no place in a facial

23

challenge.

24
25

This type of speculation

Ohio has taken all necessary precautions to
assure the minor's confidentiality, and the statute

provides a framework to fulfill its promise not to

2

disclose the minor's identity to her parents or to the

3

public.

4

In addition, the pleading forms allow the minor

5

to file a complaint containing either an allegation of

6

maturity or an allegation of best interest, or she can

7

file a third form putting both into issue.

8

is not compelled to put both into issue if she so chooses.

9
10

But the minor

A minor here has the opportunity to raise both
claims and, in fact, on the third form, is able to do so.

11

Under Bellotti II, a minor specifically is not

12

13

compelled to put both claims into issue against her will.

14

As this Court recognized in Akron v. Akron

15

Center for Reproductive Health, and in Ashcroft, the state

16

must provide an alternative procedure whereby the minor

17

may demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature, or that

18

despite her immaturity, the abortion would be in her best

19

interests.

20

The minor or counsel simply must indicate which

21

claim she chooses to put into issue.

22

form chosen, the minor is not locked into that choice.

23

Regardless of the

In addition, there are extensive procedural

24

safeguards provided for in the statute that ensure the

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

As compared with — or contrasted

with a consent?
MS. EPPLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

It

would be the state's position that there is no

And not by any — what — what is the

QUESTION:

In other words, one of the

3

justifications for this statute is to give the physician

4

information that the state thinks the physician needs?

5
6
7

MS. EPPLER:

Yes, Your Honor, to allow that

physician to maximize information, to —
QUESTION:

Well, if the physician thought the

8

information was necessary, the physician could always call

9

up and ask for it; that's clear.

But you're saying the

10

physician must do it even if the physician doesn't think

11

the information is necessary?

12

MS. EPPLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the state's

13

interest underlying that request is for the protection of

14

the minor's health.

15

QUESTION:

If —
The protection being that the

physician might not realize that there was information out

there that he or she ought to get?

18

MS. EPPLER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

19

here, specifically involving the physician, as opposed to

This Court concluded that the information was

The Ohio provision before the Court today,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA R. SOGG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

9

MS. SOGG:

Either that or grow.

10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

11

Ohio properly determined that a bypass was

12

constitutionally required in connection with its parental

13

notification statute.

14

that it followed the constitutional mandates expressly set

15

forth by this Court in Bellotti, the fact is that both

16

lower courts that have reviewed the statute have

17

determined properly that Ohio failed miserably to

18

implement the Bellotti standards in the development of its

19

parental notification statute.

20

But although Ohio claims here today

Indeed, what Ohio has accomplished by its bypass

21

is to create a procedure that lulls a young, vulnerable

22

minor into the belief- that her rights and her safety will

23

be protected, and then stacks the decks against her.

24
25

The Ohio bypass stacks the decks by imposing an
unprecedented heightened burden of proof, a clear and
23

convincing standard, on the minor.

2

proof clearly increases the chances of an erroneous and

3

harmful outcome for her when she comes before the court

4

with her petition.

5

And that burden of

That same bypass stacks the decks against the

6

minor woman by creating a pleading scheme that is not only

7

absolutely contrary to the intent and the express purpose

8

and language this Court set forth in Bellotti, but that is

9

misleading, and literally encourages an erroneous outcome

10

by prohibiting juvenile judges from themselves acting in

11

conformity with Bellotti standards.

12

Now the state has attempted to justify before

13

and has again today asserted as a justification for its

14

clear and convincing standard, burden of proof, number

.5

one, that this is not a state-initiated proceeding.

,6

That's actually incorrect.

:7
.8
.9

The fact is that but for House bill 319, no
proceeding would be necessary.
The state also indicates that a clear and

:o

convincing burden is appropriate in this circumstance

:i

because of the ex parte nature of the proceeding, and

:2

because parents are not literally there to dispute their

:3

daughter's claim of maturity or best interest.

:4

In the first instance, the very purpose of this

bypass proceeding is to avoid hostile or harmful parental

involvement.

It would be absurd; it would be a legal

2

oxymoron to have that as the purpose of the proceeding,

3

and then bemoan the fact that the parents are not present

4

to be involved and to act as an adversary to the minor.
The clear and convincing standard, furthermore,

5
6

goes contrary to every recent case decided by this Court

7

that dealt with the imposition of a burden of proof, where

8

that burden was most likely to deprive an individual of an

9

important liberty interest.
Under the Mathews test that Justice O'Connor

10
11

addressed earlier, it is clear that the minor has the

12

private liberty interest, and a substantial interest at

13

stake in this proceeding.

14

assume that this young woman would not have left school at

15

a time of trauma to come down to a juvenile court, which

16

may or may not be in her own county of residence, to fill

17

out these forms if she did not believe deeply and strongly

18

that she needed to avoid the involvement of her parents in

19

this important decision.

And I think we can safely

Having done so, that liberty interest should not

20

21

be the subject on a higher burden of proof risk of error,

22

but, quite the contrary, if any greater burden was

23

appropriate, it would clearly be on the state and not on

24

the minor.

25

characterized by the Sixth Circuit, Bellotti could not be

2

more clear in its language regarding the structure of the

3

hearing at which a minor can either prove her maturity, or

4

if her maturity is not demonstrated to the court, that the

5

court — the court must then assess whether even though

6

the minor is not mature enough to make her own informed

7

decision, whether or not that abortion is still in her

best interests.

9

Most often, because the court will have

10

determined that there has been a history or a pattern of

11

abuse of that minor, Ohio in setting up its pleading

scheme has taken that structure for evaluation from the

judge and made it literally Russian roulette for the

minor.

QUESTION:

11

the argument is a bit strained that the pleading

12

requirement is particularly onerous.

13

MS. SOGG:

Well, the view that it's onerous,

14

Your Honor, is based on the view that there is no

15

justification for throwing up a barricade or an obstacle

16

to a minor coming into the court and being able — without

17

getting a lawyer and without knowing about amendment, be

18

able to present her case in a meaningful way to the judge.

19

While it is true that the pleadings could be

20

amended, what we are doing is leaving to the discretion of

21

the judge the issue of whether he or she is going to

22

respond, and it is exactly that kind of discretion that

23

this Court found inappropriate in Bellotti.

24

Certainly it is possible to cure what is
otherwise an unconstitutional provision.

It is our view,

1

however, that because we are dealing with a young minor

2

and because the stakes are high for them, that we ought

3

not to take those risks, that the law ought to be able to

4

follow the lobby because nothing is accomplished by this

5

pleading scheme.
If the state had a reason, an argument, to say,

6

7

well, yes, we've got to do it this way — it's the only

8

way that works, it's appropriate — that might be one

9

thing.

10

The state raises no such claim here.

They have

not made any attempt to justify this pleading scheme.
QUESTION:

11

Ms. Sogg, can I ask you a question

12

about Ohio law?

Suppose a young woman in Ohio thinks she

13

has a fatal disease and wants to get an operation which

14

she thinks is necessary to eliminate it, and let's assume

15

her parents are Christian Scientists, who are people who

16

don't believe in — in — in medical procedures of that

17

sort.

18

could she go — go into a medical facility and get that

19

operation without having her parents notified?

Under Ohio law, could she — and she's a minor —

20

MS. SOGG:

Yes, Mr. Justice, she can.

21

QUESTION:

She has — she has a right to do it

MS. SOGG:

Not by statutory law, Your Honor, but

24

Ohio, as many if not most states in the Union, have case

1

rule, and that permits a minor to give consent for any

2

medical procedure, whether emergency or not, if there is a

3

determination that that minor is mature enough to do so.

4

QUESTION:

Of whatever age?

5

MS. SOGG:

Actually, of — in fact, that is

6
7

correct, Your Honor.
The cases in Ohio and — and elsewhere tend to

8

cluster around the upper teens and closer to the age of

9

emancipation, but the fact is that the case law doesn't

10

indicate any specific moment in time chronologically when

11

a minor can take advantage of the mature minor rule.

12

Now, we're all aware that that rule is for the

13

protection of the physician and of course part of our

14

concern with this statute has been the protection of

15

professionals — physicians in the State of Ohio, who,

16

should they make a slip under this statute and perform an

17

abortion on an unemancipated minor without notification,

18

for any number of reasons, that physician would be

IS

subjected to criminal penalties, to civil penalties —

20

actually, to civil, per se, liability, and to the loss of

21

his or her license to practice.

22

that yes, a mature minor in Ohio can consent.

23

But the simple answer is

The flip side of that, interestingly enough, is

24

that Ohio has really singled out the abortion issue for

25

notification, because as a matter of fact, Your Honor,

1

under Ohio law, a minor who goes to seek medical treatment

2

for sexually transmitted diseases, the physician is

3

prohibited by statute from notifying a parent.

4

In the same way, a minor who seeks treatment for

5

drug abuse in Ohio, the physician is governed by a similar

6

statute that prohibits that physician from notifying a

7

parent that the minor has sought treatment for drug abuse,

8

and the same is true, of course, as it is in every state

9

that I know of, that a minor who seeks counseling because

10

of mental health and suicidal tendencies is given absolute

11

confidentiality for any treatment they receive from the

12

suicide hotline.

13

QUESTION:

It would be quite consistent with our

14

cases, wouldn't it, to say that the state may encourage

15

people to come for drug counseling, suicidal tendencies,

16

but need not encourage abortion in the same way?

17

MS. SOGG:

That is absolutely correct, Your

18

Honor, and as a matter of fact, Appellees — Plaintiffs

19

have never disputed the fact that parents, loving parents,

20

can play an important role in the guidance of vulnerable,

21

immature children who benefit from — from that guidance,

22

and have recognized that this Court has indicated that

23

certain health care areas ought to involve, wherever

24

possible and appropriate, a loving, supportive parent.

in cases like J.R./Parham, that not all parents are

2

loving, and in the intervening year since Matheson and

3

Parham were decided by this Court, we have unfortunately

4

been visited by too many stories, too many statistics,

5

Your Honor, of how unloving parents can be.

6

tragedy that this country has the type of parental abuse

7

that we read about and hear about on a daily basis.

What a

Consequently, although we have agreed that

8

9

loving parents ought to be notified, and can be helpful to

10

an immature minor who will benefit from that help, we have

11

heartily disagreed that all parents, including abusive

12

parents, should be notified and thereby place a minor into

13

a zone of danger and the focus of this Court has

14

repeatedly been on providing protections for minors not

15

only from their — for their parents' involvement but from

16

their parents' abuse as well.

17

Perhaps no issue is as central to a fair,

18

effective and meaningful bypass than the guarantee of

19

anonymity.

20

rhetorically gloss over the question of confidentiality,

21

and the folly of failing to provide specific guidelines to

assure anonymity is nowhere better illustrated than in the

no attorney with her — and it's fair to assume that most

3

young women will not come accompanied by an attorney —

she must also provide an address where she can be reached

5

during the course of the Court proceeding, an address

6

which presumably would be a home address.

8

QUESTION:

Maybe it

could be the physician's address.

9
10

Well, not necessarily.

MS. SOGG:

It could be, certainly, Your Honor.

It could be either one.
That minor must also, no less than four times,

11
12

provide the names of her parents on the complaint form.

13

The state, although it insists that it has provided

14

confidentiality, makes statements that ring hollow in the

15

face of the forms that the minor must in fact deal with

16

and, indeed, the state has offered no justification for

17

not providing in the statute itself specific guidelines to

18

be followed by the Juvenile Court in order to guarantee

19

anonymity.

20

Even if Ohio's bypass was not so obviously

21

defective, House Bill 319 must nevertheless be found

unconstitutional, based solely on the requirement that the

locate a parent at home or at work — and indeed the

statute says if you can't get them on the phone, the

to their home because it must be accomplished personally.

19

Indeed, to ask physicians to sit down with

To ask that, on the speculative justification

difference what kind of a one it actually provides.
MS. SOGG:

The fact is, Your Honor, that this

12

Court has held in Cleveland Board of Education v.

13

Loudermill, in Goss v. Lopez and in a number of other

14

cases that where a state need not choose to create an

15

entitlement, it can choose not to do so.

16
17

20

However, once having chosen to provide that
entitlement, that procedure, what is provided must be —
QUESTION:

What is the entitlement that the

state has provided here, in your view?
MS. SOGG:

The state has provided a property

21

interest for the minor in exercising her right to avoid

22

hostile or harmful parental involvement.

23

QUESTION:

Well, property — what case of ours

24

do you think comes closest to say that the state has

provided a property interest by enacting this procedure

here?
MS. SOGG:

2

I believe Goss v. Lopez, Your Honor,

3

comes the closest.

It also dealt with minors in the

4

context of high school suspensions and as a former high

5

school principal, I can tell you it's a case we all knew

6

very well.

7

As a matter of fact, the property interest for

8

the minor has particular significance and meaning in the

9

context of the Ohio statute because the consequences of

10

the bypass being unfair and unreliable for the minor are

11

lifelong and in some cases can be disastrous.

12

Consequently, under a procedural due process

13

standard, an examination of House Bill 319 can yield but

14

one conclusion, and that is the bypass fails to meet even

15

the most minimal rational standard of review.

16

the clear and convincing standard of our burden of proof

17

in this case can hardly be said to provide the minor with

18

a meaningful manner of exercising her right to an

19

exemption as that right is granted by the bypass.

20

Once again,

Certainly the pleading traps are contrary to

21

procedural due process and must fail under that test.

22

Moreover, the expedition flaws in the statute run contrary

23

to the minor's ability to get a fair hearing and at a

24

meaningful time.

25

Ohio has recognized the competence of mature

1

minors and has expressed that competence in recognition

2

when it included a bypass for mature minors and in so

3

doing acknowledged that a mature minor woman is by

4

definition a woman and as such she is entitled to the

5

constitutional right of privacy extended to all women by

6

this Court.
Forced disclosure in any context and by any

7
8

means for that woman is inarguably a substantial,

9

unjustifiable, and undue burden on her privacy right, a

10

burden which in the case of minors dealing with a parental

11

notification law, is going to be only exacerbated by

12

efforts by parents to interfere with the minor woman's

13

abortion decision.

14

Efforts which this Court has recognized can be

15

extremely effective where minors are financially dependent

16

or susceptible to intimidation as was the case with the

17

plaintiff in our case, Rachel Roe who, if her parents had

18

been notified, faced not only abuse, but faced eviction

19

not only for herself, but for her two-year-old son as

20

well.

21

Nothing in this Court's history of balancing the

22

interests of parents and the state against the individual

23

liberties guaranteed to minors supports the conclusion

24

that this Court will abandon a mature minor's privacy

25

right any more than it will abandon a minor's First

Amendment right.
Certainly where no significant or compelling

2

3

interest on the government's part justifies such an

4

abandonment, this Court will not subject mature minors to

5

such a deprivation.
Furthermore, it is absurd to suggest that this

6
7

Court would risk the physical safety of immature minor

8

women without some overarching justification, and surely

9

no such justification exists here.
For young women like Rachel Roe, our discourse

this morning is far removed from their need for

confidentiality or their fear of parental retaliation or

13

coercion.

QUESTION:

Ms. Sogg, I'm — I'm — I'm — I —

anything else?

That's correct.

QUESTION:

I assume a parent, even a parent of a

mature minor, can prevent that minor from publishing a

newspaper if the parent says I don't want you to public

I agree with that, Your Honor.

MS. SOGG:

the rights of minors in recognition of their minority both

8

intellectually, emotionally and chronologically.

9

•

We are indeed.

What I'm suggesting is whether we look at Tinker

10

or these cases, this Court has recognized that the more

11

mature the minor, the less chronological age has to do

12

with limiting a fundamental right.

Young women like Rachel Roe welcome the support

of loving parents, and they need no statute to seek that

support, but they are counting on us to protect their

to protect their safety wherever possible.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RITA S. EPPLER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5

MS. EPPLER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

6

Initially, in response to Justice Scalia's question

7

regarding emergency treatment that a parent might oppose

8

for religious reasons, the State of Ohio clearly does take

9

a contrary position to that of the Plaintiffs in this

10

case.

12

The State of Ohio believes that there is no mature

First of all, under the scenario that — that you

13

have presented, Your Honor, there would be an ability for

14

the appointment of a guardian ad litem for temporary

15

custody under Ohio Revised Code 2151, and, in fact,

16

parents would then be required to go to court to determine

17

if the temporary custody of their child should be

18

withdrawn to permit the surgery to go forward.

19

In addition, with regard to general standards, in the

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

I'm not sure you're

22

saying — you're saying that the — that the child may be

able to — would be able to get the procedure but that it

24

is inevitable that the parents would be notified?

MS. EPPLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Through

1

the juvenile court proceeding prior to taking temporary

2

custody away from the parent under all situations, there

3

would be a requirement of parental notification.

4

In addition, with regard to the general — general

5

standards in the medical profession that would govern,

6

there would be a need for consent to be provided by a

7

parent prior to any invasive medical procedure performed

8

on a minor.

9

that have been cited to for specific exceptions provided

10

for either emergency care for diagnosis and treatment of

11

drug and alcohol rehabilitation and treatment and for

12

sexually transmitted diseases.

As evidence of this fact are the statutes

13

These exceptions are, in fact, exceptions to the

14

general rule requiring parental consent prior to invasive

15

medical procedures being performed on a minor within the

16

State of Ohio.

17

Clearly, the — the law on informed consent

18

has — has evolved a great deal since the 1956 case that I

19

believe my opponent relies on and cited to in her brief,

20

that of Lacey v. Laird.

21

dealt with an 18-year old who was requesting elective

22

surgery without the consent of her parents.

time when the age of majority was 21 within the State of

24

Ohio, and, in fact, it was an allegation or a challenge by

25

the minor claiming a technical battery.

MS. EPPLER:

That is correct, Your Honor; for

6

technical battery, assault and malpractice.

And the case

7

analyzed the question of — of whether or not that

8

physician was liable, found that he was not because this

9

18-year old minor was sufficiently mature to have

10

consented to the procedure of — of an elective nature,

11

and also found that the parents should not be financially

12

responsible for a procedure that was elective in nature or

13

non-necessary and one that they had not already consented

14

to.

15

In addition, with regard to the burden, of proof

16

questions raised, there is no question but that the

17

private interest affected here should, in fact, be looked

18

at as this Court similarly did in Parham v. J.R.

19

Under the Mathews interest, there was again a liberty

20

interest claimed there, and the state's interest was found

21

to be inextricably linked with the parents' interest in

22

the custody and the obligations for the welfare and the

23

health of the child.

24

of the Court was that the private interest at stake was a

25

combination of both the child's and the parents' interest.

Particularly there, the conclusion

Likewise is the case in the State of Ohio statute

presented for review.

With regard to physician notification, my opponent

has indicated that the physician would be required to

spend hours attempting to locate parents.

12

Honors — to be presented by certified mail and ordinary

14

reasonable efforts fail at originally notifying the parent

15

personally.

16

With regard to my opponent's questions raised on due

process of whether the statute creates any — any property

18

interest, it is clearly the state's position that there

can be no claim to a property interest in a benefit or

Regardless, even if this Court does find any type of

a property interest created by the statute, it does, in

fact, provide the minor with notice and an opportunity for

a meaningful hearing in a meaningful manner with all of

the extensive procedural safeguards that are provided by
