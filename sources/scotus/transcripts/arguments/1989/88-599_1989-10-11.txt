ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. WILLIAMS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I am here today representing prison administrators and

11

medical professionals who are charged with the responsibility

12

for the welfare of mentally ill prisoners.

13

The issue before the Court is what due process requires

14

when my clients' exercise their professional judgment in

15

making a medical treatment decision regarding a mentally ill

16

prisoner who refuses to take prescribed medications.

17

The outcome of this case will significantly affect not

18

only my clients' ability to carry out their responsibilities,

19

but also will affect the lives of the other inmates for whom

20

my clients are responsible.

21

At issue here today is the adequacy of a policy at the

22

Special Offender Center, one of 13 prisons administered by the

23

Washington Department of Corrections, which authorizes

24

treatment of certain serious mental illnesses with

25

antipsychotic medications.

recognized as the only effective treatment for certain serious

mental disorders, including schizophrenia, which was the

3

diagnosis for the respondent, Mr. Harper.

Not only is this treatment widely recognized as the only

effective treatment for persons in that situation, it is also

generally accepted medical knowledge that failure to provide

adequate treatment can result in serious adverse consequences

to the mentally ill patient.

They can deteriorate further.

a moment to explain.
Mr. Harper is currently at Western State Hospital, which

17

is a state hospital run by the Department of Social and Health

18

Services.

19

While Mr. Harper was at the Special Offender Center in

20

January of 1988, he was charged in Snohomish County Superior

21

Court with the crime of assault.

22

proceedings, which are still pending in the Snohomish County

23

Superior Court, his defense counsel has raised the question of

24

his competence to stand trial.

Respondent's counsel, that he had been taken out of the

2

Special Offender Center and taken off the medication, and that

3

that situation had continued for several years and was likely

4

to remain the same.

5

QUESTION:

Well, your Honor, with due respect to counsel,

6

that was an inaccurate representation.

Mr. Harper had been,

7

at the time of trial, transferred from the Special Offender

8

Center to the Washington State Penitentiary, which is another

prison —

Subsequent to the trial, in — I believe it was in April of

1987, he was transferred back to the Special Offender Center,

14

and beginning in September of 1987 --

QUESTION:

16

MR. WILLIAMS:

Was he ever put back on the medication?
Yes, ma'am.

Yes, your Honor.

In

September of 1987 he was again subjected to involuntary

18

medication -- pursuant to the SOC policy which had been upheld

19

at the trial level.

He'll be returned to Snohomish County Superior Court and

charges would be dismissed without prejudice.

Department of Corrections.

His current sentence that he is serving now and was

10

serving at the time this took place does not expire until

11

1995, and the earliest he could even be considered for parole

12

currently is in November of 1992.

13

he continues to be mentally ill, it seems very likely that he

14

would return to the Special Offender Center.

15

then, under the test of Vitek v. Jones, this case is not moot.
QUESTION:

16

Given that, and given that

Mr. Williams, I think Harper says that he's

that in any event he had been involuntarily medicated between

2

April '87 and May '88.

MR. WILLIAMS:

Is that right?

He was at the Special Offender Center

during that time period, and beginning in September of '87 to

May of '88 he was involuntarily medicated.

Yes, your Honor, we are.

Court in the case below.

your Honor?

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WILLIAMS:

Is that the judgment you refer to,

Yes.
And that's why we're here seeking to have

12

that overturned, because we -- if that decision is not

overturned, then of course we would be foreclosed from --

court judgments but not in state court judgments.

20

I noticed in the -- I believe it's the

In this context the issue is due process.

Now, what does

21

due process require?

The Court has frequently said that due

22

process requires only procedures which are appropriate under

23

the circumstances.

24

the nature of the process which is required cannot be divorced

25

from the nature of the ultimate decision being made.

In the Parham case, the Court said that

The decision here is a medical treatment decision.

part on Turner against Safley and — requiring a rational

7

connection between the prison administration and the rule at

issue.

9

You -- in your brief you rely in

And I'm wondering in this case -- I suppose involuntary

10

medication would fairly clearly contribute to the orderly

11

conduct of the prison and -- because these people probably

12

would be less difficult to manage and handle if they are

13

medicated than if they're not. Is that a proper consideration,

14

do you think, to rely on -- do you rely in part on that

15

consideration or do you take the position that it has to

16

entirely be in the best interest of the prisoner?

17

MR. WILLIAMS:

No.

To -- we rely on both, your Honor.

18

We believe that since it is a treatment context, it is in the

19

best interest of the prisoner.

20

Mr. Harper — was found to be, and the court below found him

21

to be a threat to -- a danger to others.

22

that that justifies the medication as well, even where the

23

prisoner feels in his best interests he wants to refuse it

24

because it poses a risk of danger to other inmates and other

25

staff.

But also, particularly like

your job a lot easier -- do we really have to face up to the

rest of the ease?

MR. WILLIAMS:

Isn't that a sufficient justification all

Well, we would submit that it is.

That

that provides at least an alternative basis for the decision

11

that we are seeking from the court.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

And is that one of the factors that the panels

will rely on in administering this program?
MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes, the SOC policy provides that the

15

medication is only administered, one, for the person who is

16

mentally ill -- so, it is a treatment context.

17

where the person is either a danger to himself or others or

18

gravely disabled, and those are very detailed -- the

19

definitions of those terms -- are spelled out in great detail.

20

Secondly,

And we believe that the policy, therefore, by its narrow

21

construction necessarily leads to a situation which was

22

contemplated in Turner v. Safley, that there would be a

23

reasonable relationship between this action and the legitimate

24

penalogical goal.

So, we believe that it is — that is a consideration, but

7

risk of an erroneous decision.

There are two potentially erroneous decisions in making
these kind of decisions.

One is to administer medications to

10

someone who isn't mentally ill or for whatever reason doesn't

require them.

decision below, not only provides a hearing opportunity for

So there is some

QUESTION:

I guess you don't -- you rely entirely on

20

in-house personnel for the review and the hearing and the

determination.

Is that right?

That is correct, your Honor.

And --

Would it be burdensome to require some outside

consultant, or is that even appropriate to think about?

I suppose there might be at least a theoretical concern.

10

But if you accept our argument that it should be a medical

11

model, any consultant that we review — we get to review it,

is going to be hired and paid for by the Department of

13

Corrections.

that kind of a challenge or concern.

And so almost inevitably there is going to be

The other point, of course --

Except that

8

the initial hearing must be followed up by -within 14 days by

9

a second hearing.

10
11

And then there are the ongoing medical

reports to the Department of Corrections.
And what I understand from the psychiatric practitioners

12

is that medical judgment is not a snapshot that you take at

13

one time.

14

progresses or fails to make progress, and that the

15

medications, the type of medications, and the dosages, are

changed, again, utilizing the subtle nuances, if you will, of

a professional judgment -- medical judgment standard.

It's an ongoing thing as the patient changes,

QUESTION:

Now, these psychotropic drugs alter the

alter the emotional state and try to produce a more

Do they alter the cognitive and perceptive

faculties of the person?

the can have that effect because they overcome the

2

hallucinatory - and illusionary-type processes that are often

3

at play with such individuals.
QUESTION:

4

Then either in a lay sense or a legal sense I

5

take it we could say that his willingness or his ability to

6

make a voluntary decision to consent or not to consent might

7

also be altered by the drugs themselves.

8

9

MR. WILLIAMS:

That could be the case.

And, in fact,

some of the medical studies that we have cited -- and I guess

10

sort of a flip side of that, which is often the initial

11

refusal to take the medication is not so much a manifestation

12

of the individual's true desire as a symptom or a

13

manifestation of the process of the illness from which they

14

are suffering.

15

QUESTION:

In a sense, then, it's qualitatively different

16

from physical restraints, in that with physical restraints the

17

prisoner at least has his voluntary decision, his will

18

respected at all times, I take it, in that he can either

19

consent to the restraints or consent to drug use?

votes against medication, and then he controls it.
\

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WILLIAMS:

13

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question also?
Yes, your Honor.

Assuming a case in which the medical equation

14

is equal -- the medic - medical people conclude it may not do

15

any good and it probably won't do any harm, but it's quite

16

clear that it will make it easier to manage the prisoner if

17

you have this very obstreperous sedated, would it be

18

permissible in your view in such a case to say you must -- you

19

may go ahead and give the drugs?

20

MR. WILLIAMS:

It would not be permissible under the SOC

21

policy because under the SOC policy you can only be

22

administered for a treatment purpose, and under your

23

hypothetical, as I understood it, there would be no treatment

24

purpose.

25

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Williams.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Larkin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR. AS AMUCUSCURIAE
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

MR. LARKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In our view, for three reasons, due process allows

7

psychiatrists to make the baseline treatment decisions

8

regarding the appropriate clinical treatment of the severely

9

mentally ill with antipsychotic medication.

10

The three reasons are as follows.

First, for more than

11

35 years antipsychotic medication has been widely recognized

12

by the psychiatric profession as an acceptable and sometimes

13

the only effective treatment for the seriously mentally ill

14

who are either dangerous, as is Respondent, or who are gravely

15

disabled.

16

Second, because antipsychotic medication is an

17

appropriate treatment for some mentally ill prisoner, the

18

questions that arise in each case involve quintessentially

19

medical judgments about the appropriateness of a particular

20

medication or a particular dosage for a specific prisoner.

21

And those judgments are more likely to be made far more

22

accurately by a physician than they are by a court.

23

Third, although we believe a prisoner has a liberty

24

interest in refusing antipsychotic medication, we also submit

25

that the state or federal government has a countervailing

interest in assuring that third-parties who are in an

2

institution are adequately protected from assault and in

3

helping to restore to a person the ability to function.

4

QUESTION:

You began by saying a severely mentally ill

5

person.

6

who has the capacity to deny consent from the standpoint of

7

exercising his voluntary choice, do we not?

But by hypothesis, we are dealing here with someone

8

MR. LARKIN:

9

QUESTION:

Not always, your Honor.
Well, doesn't the case come up to us in the

10

context where the man is deemed to be competent, in the lay

11

sense, of deciding whether he wants this medication or not,

12

and to assess the benefits and the disadvantages of not having

13

the medication?

14

MR. LARKIN:

Well, the competency standard that the

15

Respondent has argued we believe is inappropriate for three

16

reasons.

17

First, as this case illustrates, a person can be

18

competent and yet assaultive.

19

therefore, if it were adopted by this Court, would not

20

adequately protect third parties from assault because it's

21

quite clear that Respondent is seriously mentally ill.

A competency standard,

He is

i

22

23
24
25

suffering -QUESTION:

But he is not so seriously mentally ill that

if he were a lay person he could be committed.
MR. LARKIN:

Correct?

I think - no - under a lay standard, because

1

he would be found to be mentally ill and a danger to others,

2

he could be committed.

3

adopted in O'Connor v. Donaldson, and it would allow a person

4

who is mentally ill and, therefore - and a danger to others --

5

not simply mentally ill but mentally ill and a danger to

6

others -- to be committed.

7

I think that's the standard this Court

There are people -- the second reason why an incompetency

8

standard I think is inappropriate is that competency can be

9

cyclical.

A person can alternate between states in which he

10

is competent and which he is not.

11

alternate between instances in which he could be treated and

12

in which he couldn't be treated even if the medication were

13

necessary to render him competent.

14

And, therefore, he would

What could happen in that circumstance is a person would

15

continually spiral towards a worsening medical condition and

16

continuously treated on an emergency basis as the condition

17

deteriorated.

18

And third, a legal -- as competency is a legal standard.

19

It is not necessarily coincident, therefore, with the need to

20

treat someone who is gravely disabled.

21

For example, a person can be very, very severely

22

depressed — so depressed that in a prison setting he could be

23

seen to be easy prey by other inmates.

24

same time, however, may be able to decide whether or not he is

25

willing to accept certain types of treatments.

That person, at the

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

In that

1

context, it is necessary in some cases to treat that person to

2

avoid him from being assaulted by other people.

3

That's not the situation here because Respondent himself

4

was responsible for assaulting other people.

5

situation can arise.

6

Now, Justice O'Connor asked can restraints be used,

7

perhaps on a person like Respondent.

8

short-term measure for a variety of reasons.

9

Restraints are only a

But that type of

He can become dehydrated.

He could have a

Secondly, restraints don't treat the underlying mental

14

illness that is the cause of the problem.

15

Respondent also suffers from episodic and cyclical episodes of

16

violence.

17

biweekly reports that were conducted at the SOC indicated that

18

they believed that there was a two to four month pattern of

19

violence that Respondent seemed to indicate, although it was

20

-- there was an overlapping episodic series of violent

21

assaults that could occur.

22

Someone like

For example, some of the evidence in some of the

In that sort of circumstance, it would be impossible to

23

predict when in a particular instance a violent out - outburst

24

might occur and a restraint, therefore, would be an

25

ineffective means of preventing that sort of circumstance.

1

So restraints, however, I might add, are the type of

2

consideration that a physician or psychiatrist should be

3

required to consider under the professional judgment standard

4

that this Court adopted in the Youngberg case.

5

That standard would require a physician to decide amongst

6

the acceptable medical treatments by considering a variety of

7

factors such as the prisoner's past history, his current

8

mental status, his responsiveness to other types of drugs or

9

medication, the risk type and severity of side effects that

10

could occur, and the prospects of gain from using a particular

11

treatment.A court can then intervene in a particular case

12

after the fact just to ensure that a physician exercised his

13

professional judgment.

14

should be taken out of this altogether.

15

psychiatrists should serve as the baseline decision-makers.

16

QUESTION:

It is not our view that the court
It's our view that

Mr. Larkin, do you think the standard for a

17

prison inmate is any different from the standard for a person

18

who has been committed civilly to a mental hospital?

22

23

MR. LARKIN:

No.

I think in factual cases there will be

a variety of different circumstances.
QUESTION:

So then your analysis wouldn't rely at all on

Turner against Safley and that line of cases?
MR. LARKIN:

Correct.

The same factual scenarios can

arise in both contexts.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LARKIN:

QUESTION:

Now, of course, in a prison context -I think your position is a little different

than the state's position then.

4

MR. LARKIN:

Correct.

It is a little different.

Our --

5

our ultimate standard would apply whether a person is in a

6

facility such as the SOC, or is in a mental ward of a

7

hospital, or whether he is in a psychiatric institution in a

8

state or a local government's care.

9

the same standard would apply across the board.

10

Now, this --

11

QUESTION:

In that respect, we think

I'm not sure you -- you say a danger to other

is part of the thing that doctors can consider as -- in

connection with the medical determination.

rather than a prison administration criterion.

You've just

You acknowledge that that's one of the things that can be

considered in prescribing the medical -- the treatment,

18

whether a person would be a danger to other -others.

MR. LARKIN:

QUESTION:

21

MR. LARKIN:

Correct.
Isn't that right?
Correct.

But a person who is a danger to

22

others because, say, for example, he's suffering from a

delusion or hallucination that perhaps the guards are the

Now, we think, although this case, as Justice Stevens

13

pointed out, involves only a prisoner who is assaultive and

14

therefore violent, is also one in which for a variety of

15

reasons the Court may want to address the question of whether

16

the professional judgment standard would apply to persons who

17

are gravely disabled.

18

And we think someone who is gravely disabled and

19

therefore who is in need of medical treatment for his illness

20

is also a person who can be treated, because, as my colleague

21

pointed out, in some cases the only alternative is a lifetime

22

of institutionalization for someone who is severely mentally

23

ill, whether or not he is dangerous.

24

If he has regressed so far that no other treatment is
effective, antipsychotic medication is an appropriate means of

helping to restore that person to a sufficient level of

2

functioning so that he can ultimately leave an institution.

3

Or, even if he cannot, then he can function within that

institution at a - at an acceptable level.

The competency standard that Respondent has urged does

little, we think, to help serve both of those goals, for the

reasons that I explained before.

QUESTION:

And I guess the state has some concern about

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I think that's -- the two questions

4

posed are where we get to the difficulty in this case, and

5

that is to separate out the parens patriae power from the

6

police power of the state.

7

patriae power of the state does not extend to a competent

8

prisoner the ability of the state to force treatment.

9

Now, the police power, that's a different issue.

And I would submit that the parens

And I

10

think when we look at the police power interest in this case,

11

I don't think that the police power interest is sufficient to

12

justify the long-term involuntary treatment with antipsychotic

13

medications that was at issue in this case.

14

There are, as your Honor has pointed out,, other

alternatives.

Now, counsel for the Petitioner indicated, well, those don't

have any treatment benefits.

But what it teaches us, it seems to me,
And the

In response to this decision, the Harper decision, the

10

state legislature engrafted, if you will, the Harper decision

11

onto the civil commitment laws of the State of Washington, and

12

I think that's a recognition that this isn't so burdensome.

13

In response to Vitek, Congress required judicial hearings

14

for the transfer from a prison to a mental health hospital.

15

That's an indication that it isn't so very burdensome.

it's not so very burdensome, then what's the problem with

There is a Law Review article cited in my memorandum, I

7

I mean, Mr. Harper personally would be, I think, less -- would

be satisfied if he had a hearing somewhere before a judge and

9

not a decision made wholly within the institution because when

10

the decision was made in this case -- and is typically made in

11

- within the institution -- what occurs is the staff of the

12

hospital consult outside the presence of Mr. Harper with the

13

hearing committee, review the basis for their decision to

14

recommend treatment, discuss whether or not the guidelines

15

have been met, and then Mr. Harper is brought into the

And didn't Vitek involve a transfer for

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

Correct.

Yes.

For behavior modification treatment.
Which is different than this kind of

treatment?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, it's not as intrusive.

So, it's just a degree of intrusiveness?
I think that's a very important factor.

In Vitek it isn't as intrusive and it doesn't have the kind of

That was behavioral modification

Well, it --

That this doesn't or that -- what does this do

to you that that doesn't?
MR. PHILLIPS:

It - It's designed to alter your behavior

but I would submit that one can refuse to participate.

MR. PHILLIPS:

And altering your will a little bit?
One can refuse to participate in the

treatment.

in this case, your -- your ability to refuse in the treatment

doesn't result in akathisia or dystonia, or these other

side-effects.The other point I think about the procedures

And I want to refer to Addington v. Texas where the Court

decided that a clear, cogent and convincing standard was the

appropriate standard before civil commitment.

15

the burden of proof is one way to impress the fact-finder with

the chances that inappropriate commitments will be ordered.

MR. WILLIAMS:

Thank you, your Honor.

Just a couple of

brief points.
First, in response to Justice Steven's question about the

4

number of prisoners.

I believe it was.

7

have been through the hearings required by the decision below.

As of the date of trial, there were 25,

As of the date of the Washington Supreme

That's out of the 144 prisoners at the Special Offender
Center and 6,000 inmates throughout the Washington Department
of Corrections system.

Do you know what the -- what the success rate

MR. WILLIAMS:

Has the judge usually said, go

In all seven that have been brought at the

prison that has been the result, your Honor.
And the other point in response to the questions Justice

17

White had about Vitek, it's true that the decision there

18

speaks in terms of mandatory behavior modification, but it's

19

our understanding based upon one of the amicus briefs that

20

Respondent submitted, that treatment with antipsychotic

21

medications was contemplated there.

indication in the trial court memorandum decision which is

23

published.

that as well, your Honor.

25

And there is an

1

treatment wouldn't necessarily involve the considerations that

2

are in this case?

3

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, I think they may arguably -- and if

4

it does involve medication, it may arguably involve different

5

kinds of considerations.

6

But the point remains that the purpose in Vitek was

7

transfer for a treatment, and what we're dealing with here is

8

treatment.

9

And that brings me to the third point I wanted to make.

10

Counsel suggested that the SOC policy was not geared to

11

treatment.

12

prescribed by a psychiatrist or in an emergency somebody with

13

prescriptive authority and confirmed by a psychiatrist within

14

24 hours.

15

for a non-therapeutic purpose would be illegal.The final

16

point.

17

decision, and a due process analysis, the question is what

18

process is most likely to result in the correct decision.

19

we submit that having a judge make the decision after a full

20

hearing which necessary involves at a minimum delay and in

21

some instances appropriate medical judgment denied, that that

22

does not meet the test of due process.

23

implemented in this SOC policy is more appropriate under the

24

due process analysis.

25

The SOC policy requires that the medications be

And under Washington law, prescribing medications

Since this is a medication decision, a treatment

make the decision which the judge makes for civil commitment,

2

not that - on the details of medical treatment, but at least a

3

judicial decision that the person is a danger to himself or

4

others?

5

to himself or others?

6

That the person is either incompetent or is a danger

That has been the traditional necessary judicial judgment

7

before you can get civil commitment, right?

8

object to that?

9

MR. WILLIAMS:

Now, would you

Well, I guess the response to that is what

10

value does that add to the decision-making process to have a

11

judge make that decision when the result, if he makes a

12

negative decision even though medical professional judgment

13

indicates that the person does constitute because of his

14

medical condition a threat to himself or others -- if one of

15

the outcomes is that the judge is going to in effect overturn

16

that decision, what you have is a judge interfering with the

17

professional medical judgment which this court has said

18

persons in custody are entitled to.

19

I think that the judge doesn't add anything, and it --

20

and it increases the risk that an erroneous decision not to

21

provide treatment will be made.
