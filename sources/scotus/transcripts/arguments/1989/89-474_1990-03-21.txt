ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. STELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This matter is here on a writ of certiorari issued to

11

the New York State Court of Appeals.

And the issue raised

12

is whether, within the constraints of the double jeopardy

13

clause of the Fifth Amendment, a motorist, who causes the

14

death of another person as a result of an automobile

15

collision, may be subject to a prosecution for homicide

16

and/or assault, even though, at the scene of the collision

17

and prior to the death of the motorist he or she — prior

18

to the death of the other person that motorist is charged

19

with driving while intoxicated and failure to keep right,

20

and then subsequent to the death, enters pleas of guilty

21

to those vehicle and traffic violations, and is sentenced.

22

In this case, on October 3rd, 1987 there was an

23

automobile — there were — collision — an automobile

24

driven by the Respondent, Thomas Corbin, was being

operated in a westbound direction on Route 55 in the town

It first collided with an eastbound vehicle and

and struck a second vehicle in which Brenda Dirago was the

passenger.

It proceeded into the eastbound lane

QUESTION:

What is the jurisdiction of the justice

7

court to which you refer, Mrs. Steller, so far as what

8

kind of crimes can it hear pleas to?

9

MS. STELLER:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, it would

10

generally hear misdemeanors and violations.

It would have

11

preliminary jurisdiction over felonies, but its

12

jurisdiction would be limited to holding a preliminary

13

hearing, and setting bail on a non-Class A case, which

14

would be a —

QUESTION:

Binding over, in effect?

16

MS. STELLER:

17

I might also add that an assistant district attorney

Does all — do these facts make any

difference to your legal argument?

I mean, supposing the

6

state's attorney had been fully advised all the way along

7

the line, you'd still have the same legal argument,

8

wouldn't you?

9

MS. STELLER:

Yes, Your Honor, because we rely on New

10

York State Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 1800(d), and we

11

have relied on it in the state courts.

12

QUESTION:

Your position is, even if he pleaded

13

guilty or was convicted of this offense,

14

ahead and prosecute him for the greater offense.

15

MS. STELLER:

16

QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor.

So I don't know, why — what relevance,

17

all these facts have.

MS. STELLER:

QUESTION:

you could go

Okay.

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'll —

I'm just suggesting that I'm not

sure I

understand.
MS. STELLER:

be followed, that being that —

MS. STELLER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

That being that

2

a defendant may be charged with the greater — with a

3

greater offense, or maybe charged with two offenses --

4

where -- and there can be subsequent prosecutions -- where

5

there are different elements involved in each.

6

And in this case, we're here on an indictment which

7

charged the defendant with manslaughter — or counts of

8

the indictment pertaining to manslaughter, criminally

9

negligent homicide and assault.

10

QUESTION:

But I -- I take it from the opinion of the

11

state court that the prosecution is bound by its pleadings

12

in its bill of particulars.

13

as one in which the only way the prosecution can prove its

14

case is to prove the same matters that were shown in the

15

earlier proceeding on which there has now been a judgment.

16

MS. STELLER:

17

QUESTION:

MS. STELLER:

And so, we can take this case

Well, Your Honor --

Is — is that correct?

QUESTION:

He was

Well, there are some additional factors

23

but, really, the essential part of the prosecution's case

24

is going to rely on the matters that were concluded by the

25

traffic offense in the traffic court.

Is that not

correct?
MS. STELLER:

In large part.

However, the accident

3

reconstructionist's report — which was not available

until January of 1988 -- also indicated the speeds — the

respective speeds of the vehicles and the positions of the

vehicles at the time of impact.

This was not —

MS. STELLAR:

QUESTION:

14

MS. STELLER:

That's

A large part —

— that's what your state court says.
—■ yes.

A large part.

The court of

15

appeals' majority opinion indicates that we are bound by

16

the bill of particulars until amended, and it has not been

17

amended, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

So -- so don't we take the case as one in

19

which in the second trial the proof is going to be of the

20

same facts that were proven in the first trial?
MS. STELLER:

21

Yes, Your Honor.

Plus additional

22

facts.

But you must remember, there was no first trial

It might present it in a different
I recognize that —

Well, what's the legal — what's the legal

difference?
MS. STELLER:

In the sense that you would know

exactly what evidence was — had been presented —
QUESTION:

But we do know because your state court

has told us.
MS. STELLER:

The state court has told us that we are

15

bound by our bill of particulars, which does include

16

elements which were involved in the crimes to which the

17

defendant pled guilty.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

So I think you have to tell us why that

does not constitute a bar.
MS. STELLER:

Because, Your Honor, this Court has

21

never held that we must try all offenses that arise from

22

one series of acts or one acts in one trial.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what about Harris against Oklahoma?

Does that have a bearing on this, do you think?
MS. STELLER:

I don't think so, Justice O'Connor,

1

because in Harris there is a footnote that in the state's

2

brief, the state conceded that both felony murder and the

3

underlying robbery were the same.

4

And also, in this Court's opinion in Vitale, this

5

Court recognized — or this Court commented about the —

6

it's cited or it's quoted at page 18 of the petitioner's

7

main brief, "For the purposes of the double jeopardy

8

clause, we do not consider the crime generally described

9

as felony murder as a separate offense distinct from its

10

various elements.

11

course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense

12

and the robbery as a species of lesser included offense."

13

Rather, we treat a killing in the

Here, I don't think you can ever say that driving

14

while intoxicated is a lesser included offense of

15

manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or assault

16

because the homicide charges involve a death, the assault

17

charge involves physical injury.

18

Driving while intoxicated involves operation of a

19

motor vehicle that is not is not necessarily involved in a

20

manslaughter or an assault prosecution.

21

QUESTION:

(Inaudible).

22

MS. STELLER:

Not in every manslaughter case, Your

23

Honor.

24

This is a more traditional manslaughter charge.

25

And this is not a vehicular manslaughter charge.

No, Your Honor, I didn't.

You didn't even mention it in your brief.

Would you mind mentioning it now?
MS. STELLER:

Certainly, Your Honor.

I think that in

— in the reply brief I did mention it, Your Honor.

In your reply brief, you gave it one

sentence.

QUESTION:

MS. STELLER:

Yes, Your Honor, I did.

But you didn't mention —
But I don't — I'm sorry, Your Honor.

You didn't mention it in your main brief.
No, Your Honor, because I don't believe

14

that we are -- this Court has held that we would be

15

collaterally estopped, or that res judicata would apply in

16

this particular case.

17

case we are governed by this Court's rulings in

18

Blockburger and Vitale.

19

And I think that in this type of

Also, I think that this Court has recognized that

20

there is a strong public interest in law enforcement and

21

that the people should be given a full and fair

22

opportunity to present their case.

23

something that arises with collateral estoppel and res

24

judicata.

25

And I think that's

That doesn't happen here.

And I think the legislature of the State of New York

1

has a right when they are enacting a statutory scheme to

2

consider this Court's rulings, such as Blockburger, such

3

as Gavieres, and decide that it is permissible to have

4

vehicle and traffic offenses prosecuted separately because

5

they are not generally lesser included offenses of assault

6

and homicide.

7
8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

And that's because each has an element

that the other doesn't have?
MS. STELLER:

On the traditional homicide and assault

charges, yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

And —

Ms. Steller, if — if I may put in my

12

candidate for things that aren't mentioned in the brief

13

that maybe should have been, the earliest case I see cited

14

by any side is, I think, 1871.

15

about a hundred years before that.

16

any interest at all at — at what — at the time the

17

Constitution was adopted — being tried twice for the same

18

offense was thought to apply to?

19

MS. STELLER:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

These words were written
Is — is nobody have

I think —

Have you done any historical research in

it at all — what — what — you know what —
QUESTION:

I think, Your Honor, this Court's

23

decisions which are cited in our briefs, refer to

24

Blackstone's Commentaries.

25

in England you would not be prosecuted for two offenses in

And I think that traditionally

the same indictment.
And I think you'd seen that in this Court in Thigpen

3

v. Roberts because in Mississippi there was a DWI

4

prosecution and a homicide prosecution.

5

during the argument — oral argument it was discussed that

6

traditionally in Mississippi you were not allowed to join

7

offenses.

QUESTION:

9

MS. STELLER:

10

Uh-huh.
And that results from the common law

traditions.

QUESTION:

MS. STELLER:

historical analysis —

And what does that prove?

QUESTION:

15

MS. STELLER:

QUESTION:

17

MS. STELLER:

18

And I believe,

Well, Your Honor, you asked me about a

Right, right.
— and I believe --

— well, now how does —
— that historically you would not have

joined a minor offense with a more serious offense.

19

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

20

MS. STELLER:

Obviously at common law we wouldn't

21

have vehicle and traffic violations, but I think that

22

anything of that nature would not have been joined.

23

QUESTION:

But how does — how does that establish

24

that the only application of this provision of the

25

Constitution is to offenses that have different elements

1

as opposed to later prosecution on the basis of the same

2

facts?

3

I mean, I have no doubt that there is — is

4

substantial historical support for the position that you

5

take that you can't try a person for an offense that

6

includes the same element of an offense already committed

7

and nothing additional.

8

whether it includes something beyond that, whether it

9

includes using the same evidence as a necessary part of

10
11

But the issue before us is

the later prosecution.
QUESTION:

I think that this Court has held

12

previously that it is not -- that it is perfectly

13

permissible to use some of the same evidence.

14

that that issue was addressed by the court in Vitale,

15

where the Court indicated that it was permissible.

16

I think

In fact, part of Vitale's problem may have been the

17

way it arose in this Court.

18

on a petition for certiorari.

19

and remanded to the Supreme Court of Illinois for further

20

proceedings to determine whether it was based on a Federal

21

question — whether their decision was based on a Federal

22

question.

23

that it was — their decision was based on a federal

24

issue.

25

Vitale came before the Court

1

possibility that the state will seek to rely on all of the

2

ingredients necessarily included blah, blah, blah, would

3

not be sufficient to bar.

4

fact it turned out that the evidence was the same, there

5

might have been a problem.

6

MS. STELLER:

It — it did suggest that if in

Your Honor, I believe the majority

7

opinion in dicta says a substantial double jeopardy claim.

8

But substantial should not be equated with dispositive.

9

Because if it was dispositive, then there would have been

10

no need for a majority opinion.

And in the briefs in

11

Vitale which were filed with this Court, the state

12

indicated what its evidence was going to be.

13

Also, although the Supreme Court of Illinois had

14

indicated in its opinion that the failing to slow — which

15

was the motor vehicle violation — was a lesser included

16

offense of manslaughter — which is the charge that

17

Respondent Vitale was charged with following his vehicle

18

and traffic trial, during oral argument, Respondent — in

19

this Court — Respondent Vitale's counsel conceded that it

20

was not the lesser included offense.

21

But I think the issue there — and I think we

22

addressed it in our -- our brief, if I may refer to it —

23

at page 17, the term "the" in your opinion, immediately

24

preceding the reckless act, implies that you might have

25

been concerned based on the Supreme Court of Illinois's

opinion that the prior conviction for failing to slow

2

would always be an element of involuntary manslaughter.

3
4
5

Here that's not the case.

We are — we clearly have

separate offenses with separate elements.
QUESTION:

Ms. Steller, may I ask you two questions?

6

One, do you know what happened in Vitale after we sent it

7

back for the last time?

8

9
10

MS. STELLER:

It was my understanding, Your Honor,

that the court's —,the Supreme Court of Illinois did not
permit the prosecution.

11

QUESTION:

I — I just didn't know —

12

MS. STELLER:

I think that was the decision, but

13

their decision also was — in the case that was before

14

you, the supreme court's decision was that the failure to

15

slow was a lesser included offense of the homicide.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. STELLER:

18
19

Right.
That is not the way this case reaches

this Court.
QUESTION:

No, I understand.

In this case, as I

20

understand it, we have four different offenses.

21

can't remember them — reckless manslaughter, criminally

22

negligent homicide, and third-degree reckless assault —

23

each of which has an element that none of the others do.

24

So under Blockburger — if I understand -- let me be sure

25

I have your position.

MS. STELLER:

2

Well, Justice Scalia, I think there is

3

an issue here, and that is what was the issue before the

5

And I think you've already decided that.
In a case where a person was charged with committing

6

six robberies and there was trial on four of them, and the

participated.

could not proceed with that — with that additional

The Fifth

It doesn't tell us what the

of what the term "same offense" means.

The good Lord only

I sure don't.

But insofar as the historical exegesis that one of
Your Honors asked for, there are two things.

Deeply

10

rooted in the double jeopardy clause is the ancient — it

11

must be an ancient maxim because it's in Latin "Nemo debet

bis vexari pro eadem causa."

13

it's got to be old.

14

QUESTION:

15
16

And if it's in Latin, then

Well, it may be Latin and old, but how do

we know it's deeply rooted in the double jeopardy clause?
MR. FARRELL:

Well, Your Honor, I'm going to have to

17

take the word of the historical exegesis done on several

18

occasions by this Court and by some of the law review

19

writers that track the idea of a proscription against

20

double jeopardy, as we call it now, back to at least

21

Demosthenes' times, about the three centuries before the

22

common era.

23

And flowing from that and taking the well-known

they were prepared to prosecute on the tickets.

The town justice, not wanting to enter or make any

sentence on that date, adjourned the case to a night when

3

the district attorney's office was scheduled to have one

of its representatives present.

5

One of its representatives, Assistant District

Attorney Sauter, showed up on the night set by the court

7

for sentencing, unarmed with any information about case

except what she could find in the court file, and in the

court file all that was there were these two tickets.

Justice Caplicki imposed sentence, a $350 fine,

suspension of license, driving school.

12

later — six weeks later -- the district attorney's

13

office, or more precisely, the grand jury in Dutchess

14

County, returned the indictment that gave rise to the

15

initiation of the proceedings in this case, where the

16

counts in the indictment were challenged both on state law

17

grounds and under the double jeopardy clause of the state

18

and Federal constitutions.

ground that somehow the defendant was guilty of procuring

his own conviction, repelled division the second

And then the New York State Court of Appeals, writing

2

for a four-judge majority, Mr. Justice Titone held that

3

although certain — the first — the manslaughter

4

vehicular homicide or the vehicular assault charges in the

5

indictment survived, a Blockburger-based analysis taking

6

hold of the language in this Court's opinion in the Vitale

7

case, the majority's observation that if the same evidence

8

were to be used to support the prosecution on the homicide

9

charges, there would be a substantial constitutional

10
11

question.
And seizing upon also, the language in the -- excuse

me — dissenting opinion, that to quibble with the

13

characterization of the substantiality of the

14

constitutional question, would rather simply be

dispositive of the constitutional question held that

16

Blockburger notwithstanding the prosecution in this case

17

is barred under the double jeopardy clause as read by the

this Court as barring further prosecution.

that holding that we come to this Court.

It seems that of the protections of the Fifth

in the Thigpen case in the decision below mounted the sort

2

of analysis that we suggest ought be followed, that was

3

followed by the New York State Court of Appeals, that was

4

followed even more recently in a case we cite somewhat

5

frequently in the brief, Connecticut decision of State v.

6

Lonergan, to first parse the statutes themselves as

7

written, the two statutes that are said to create the

8

double jeopardy problem.

9

If the two statutes do not survive a Blockburger-

10

based analysis there, the double jeopardy inquiry ends,

11

and the double jeopardy clause precludes prosecution — a

12

second prosecution.

13

The prosecutor, and I suspect, any prosecutor —

14

certainly if I were a prosecutor — would look to have the

15

inquiry end right there.

16

ends, then that's where the inquiry ends.

18

the Brown case a few years before Vitale, that Blockburger

19

is not the answer.

And if that's where the inquiry
But it seems,

Blockburger is an answer, an answer.

The answer as to what the simple language, the

21

simple, but as events since the adoption of the amendment

22

indicates, complex problems presented by the double

23

jeopardy clause lies in looking beyond the definitions,

24

looking to the underlying idea, as this Court has said

25

back in 1957 in the oft-quoted language of Green v. the
31

1

United States, looking to the deeply ingrained idea that

2

the state with all its power should not be allowed to make

3

repeated attempts to convict an individual.

4

Even earlier — I take that back — at approximately

5

the same time that that statement was made by this Court

6

in its opinion in Green v. the United States and a case

7

decided a few years earlier, Brock v. North Carolina,

8

writing at a time before the incorporation through the

9

Fourteenth Amendment of the Fifth Amendment into the

10

jurisprudence of the states, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in

11

his concurring opinion said that in a due process analysis

12

— in a due process analysis — fairness indicates that a

13

prosecutor who has been incompetent or casual or even

14

ineffective shouldn't be given an opportunity to see if he

15

or she cannot do better a second time.

16

It is the second time aspect that raises the question

17

of whether there isn't even a third level beyond which the

18

prosecution must pass before the prosecution is allowed

19

the proceed to try the defendant again on a second charge

20

where the factual matrix that gives rise to the second

21

charge is sensibly indistinguishable from the first

QUESTION:

Mr. Farrell, what if the death here had

3

occurred several months after the — after the accident so

4

that at the time your client was prosecuted for the

5

misdemeanor charges in the justice court there had been no

6

death?

7

MR. FARRELL:

It's -- it's quite clear, Your Honor,

8

in the cases both of the state and in this Court, that if

9

the prosecutor does not have available all of the

10

information needed to mount the particular prosecution

11

under attack, then the double jeopardy clause allows a

12

prosecution as — as I understand your hypothetical, the

13

so-called later-death cases.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Now, how — how — how does that fit in

under your version of the -- the same-evidence test?
MR. FARRELL:

The same-evidence test, as we would

17

envision it being applied in this case, would be to take a

18

look at the situation as the prosecutor knows it at the

19

time that first guilt-imposing proceeding is ready to go

20

to adjudication.

21

And if we were to take that in this case, and look at

what the prosecution knew — knew — when the defendant

23

went before the court, the prosecution knew that it had

evidence of intoxication.

Because we are told by the prosecutor, Your — Mr.

Under your theory, I take it, if the state

were to have come several months later on evidence of

intoxication which it didn't have at first, then there

12

would be an exception for that too just like there would

13

be for a later death?

MR. FARRELL:

It would be difficult to imagine how

that could happen, but I think that —

And that is it's all very well and good to say that

it was a double jeopardy clause, but if you want to

to undergo the travail, run the gauntlet, if you will, to

But the thrust of our brief is that there are at
least three identifiable in the jurisprudence of this
Court — three identifiable tests — screens, if you will
— filters, through which the prosecution must pass.
QUESTION:

What is the third?

What is the third --

was the third one the same-transaction test?
MR. FARRELL:

The third one is the same transaction

test, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
has it?

That's never been adopted by the Court,

It's been rejected several times.

MR. FARRELL:

No, sir, and it has been pointed out

that the Court's declination to adopt that test has been
characterized in one of this Court's writings as a
steadfast refusal to adopt it.
But I would like to take the time that's available to
me in the argument to suggest that perhaps the
steadfastness of that refusal might warrant some
reexamination in this case adding a couple of — a couple
of additional observations to what has probably been said
better, and said, perhaps, more often, and perhaps more
articulately than I can say it.
But there is, underlying this whole double jeopardy
problem a consideration of the fairness to the defendant,
who is facing the somewhat awesome power of the court.

got the material, put it all in one indictment and

Like the suggestions made in the model penal code

5

that are cited in our brief in opposition to the petition

of certiorari, like the cites in the American Bar

Association — I think Project for Minimum Standards of

the brief in the civil case, the reasonable expectation —

10

the reasonable expectation that — by the bench and by the

11

bar that these claims would all be asserted in a single

12

vehicle, then that reasonable expectation is part of the

13

reasonableness that is inherent in the term fairness.

14

And the fairness that is inherent in the system is

translated in this context into a — an adoption of

principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, borrowed
