CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

next this morning in No. 88-1076, J. Paul Preseault v.

5

Interstate Commerce Commission.

6

Mr. Berger, you may proceed.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER, ESQ.

8
9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

10

the Court, this case involves a congressional intent to

11

preempt state real property law throughout the country and

12

in so doing transform private property into public

13

recreational hiking and biking trails.

14
15
16

This morning I would like to address key
elements of the two fundamental issues in this case.
First, the invalidity of this statute under the

17

Fifth Amendment, examining both the Second Circuit's broad

18

holding that under no set of facts could this statute ever

19

be a taking of property, and then discussing the inability

20

of the claims court to provide compensation for any taking

21

which might occur because of the strict congressional

22

prohibition on the expenditure of funds which were not

23

appropriated for the purpose of this statute.

24
25

Second, I would like to discuss the invalidity
of this statute as a commerce clause regulatory measure in

1

light of the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission

2

cannot approve the conversion of an abandoned railroad

3

right of way to a recreational hiking or biking trail

4

until after it first determines that there is no future

5

railroad need for the particular right of way in question.
I would like to turn first, then, to the Fifth

6

7

Amendment problems in this case.

8
9

First, what the statute does is clearly to
override and change settled state law.

The reason, in

10

fact, why this statute was enacted in 1983 as an amendment

11

to the National Trails Act was that trail groups had tried

12

to transform abandoned railroad rights of way into

13

recreational trails before that and found themselves

14

confronted by state courts which would not permit it.

15

The reason that the state courts would not

16

permit it is that what the railroads acquired, usually in

17

the 1800s, was an easement for railroad right of way

18

purposes.

19

stated in this nation, once the railroad stopped using the

20

right of way for railroad purposes, for running trains,

21

the easement would vanish and the underlying fee title

22

owner would be entitled to full

23

possession of the property.

24
25

And under settled state law in virtually every

use, enjoyment, and

So that state courts were not, based on that
body of law, permitting the transformation of abandoned

1

rights of way into some other use because the railroad in

2

a very classic sense owned nothing and therefore could

3

transfer nothing.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Nance — excuse me — Mr. Berger,

5

is it possible that the state law that applies to define

6

the property interest of your clients would take into

7

account the federal determinations of public purpose or

8

railway use?

9
10
11
12

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

The major —
Is it possible that the state law

determination would look back at the federal position?
MR. BERGER:

I believe it does work into the

13

calculus, Justice O'Connor.

14

that it's been consistently held both by this Court and by

15

the Vermont Supreme Court that until the Interstate

16

Commerce Commission declares an abandonment of a railroad

17

right-of way there is no room for the state law to come

18

into effect.

19

the supremacy clause.

20

The way that it works in is

State law, until that point, is preempted by

And my clients have no quarrel with that state

21

of affairs where the Interstate Commerce Commission,

22

exercising its expertise on the need for rail

23

transportation and the need for particular rights of way,

24

determines whether the abandonment of a right of way is

25

appropriate in a particular case.

1

Once there is an abandonment, however, this

2

Court's opinions are likewise clear that state law then

3

takes over and controls and the ICC and the federal

4

determinations are out of the picture and —

5

QUESTION:

Well, here, of course, they may take

6

the position that there still has been no abandonment

7

because of the ultimate reserved potential use.

8
9

MR. BERGER:

The way that that works, Justice

O'Connor, is that before the ICC considers whether to

10

approve the negotiations between a railroad and either a

11

state and local agency or a recognized trail organization

12

to transform this right of way into a recreational right

13

of way from a full-blown transportation right of way, the

14

ICC first has to determine that it is appropriate for the

15

railroad to abandon railroad usage of this right of way

16

and that there is neither present nor future public

17

railroad need for the right of way.

18

10903, 49 USC, and the statute is very clear.

19

The ICC is also very clear on that.

20

earlier this year that in every trails case before they

21

reach the trail question they will already have decided

22

that the public use does not require continued railroad

23

usage and permits the railroad to fully abandon the

24

railroad usage.

25

QUESTION:

That's in Section

They said

Even if you are correct so far, I

1

suppose it's arguable that you still have a Tucker Act

2

remedy for your clients to get compensation.
MR. BERGER:

3

That is certainly the other

4

question in this case, and I'd be happy to address that

5

since Your Honor is interested in it.
The Tucker Act, of course — and I must confess

6

7

I find it strange standing here arguing that there is no

8

right on behalf of my clients to recover compensation and

9

find the Solicitor General arguing, oh, yes, they should

10

be getting money for this.

11

The — analyzing the Tucker Act question gets us

12

into the issue of action Congress authorized the federal

13

government to take.

14

technical, but this Court in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, in

15

the Regional Rail Reorganization Act cases most recently,

16

concluded that the Tucker Act and a suit for compensation

17

in the claims court is available for authorized

18

governmental activity and only for authorized governmental

19

activity.

20

And it may get a little bit

If it's not authorized, then this Court and the

21

claims court treat it as a tort and that's not available

22

for recompense under the Tucker Act.

23

So, we have to examine the statute in this case

24

to determine what is it that Congress authorized anybody

25

to do under this statute.

And what we find is that

1

Congress authorized the conversion of abandoned railroad

2

rights of way into recreational hiking and biking trails

3

if that could be done without the expenditure of federal

4

money unless Congress had specifically appropriated money

5

for this program in advance of the acquisition.

6

Section 101 of this statute, and it is as clear an

7

expression of congressional attempt to control expense as

8

I've ever seen.

9

QUESTION:

Where will we find Section 101 of the

10

statute?

11

the appendix or somewhere?

Do you — do you have handy a ready citation to

MR. BERGER:

13

QUESTION:

MR. BERGER:

15

That's in

It —
If you don't -It's on page 18 of the Solicitor

General's brief, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BERGER:

Thank you.
What the statute says, and I'll be

18

happy to read it for the record and for the Court, is

19

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this act,

20

authority to enter into contracts and to make payments

21

under this act shall be effective only to such extent or

22

in such amounts as are provided in advance in

23

appropriations acts. "

24
25

What the intent of Congress was in doing this
was to create essentially a voluntary program that would

1

result in no liability to the federal government if

2

voluntary agreements could be worked out among the parties

3

that they thought were involved in these proceedings.
The problem is that the way that the statute is

4
5

set up, the way that the ICC administers it, the people

6

who own the underlying fee interest in these rights of way

7

are not even consulted, let alone brought into the

8

picture.

9

QUESTION:

Well, the Solicitor General in his

10

brief right after having set forth that section says that

11

this is not sufficient to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy.

12

The language now is saying that any other provision of

13

this act is a common provision in appropriation bills and

14

is not the clear withdrawal of the Tucker Act remedy that

15

we've required.

16

MR. BERGER:

Your Honor, I recognize the

17

Solicitor General has argued that position.

18

me that what we need to do is to look at what this Court

19

has done with similar provisions in the past and with

20

congressional restrictions on expenditures.

21

It seems to

The classic case is the case which is cited in

22

the briefs, called Hooe v. United States, a case this

23

Court decided sometime in the '20s, I,believe, but was

24

relied on this by Court in the Regional Rail

25

Reorganization Act cases a decade ago to describe and

1

illustrate what this Court meant by authorized

2

congressional action.

3

What happened in Hooe was that the Congress had

4

created the Civil Service Commission, authorized it to

5

both exist and rent quarters.

6

sum of money for it to rent those quarters.

7

And then it appropriated a

The Commission went out and rented quarters but

8

instead of renting $4,000 worth or space like Congress had

9

told it to do, the Commission had a $6,000 appetite.

When

10

the landlord accepted the rent from the Commission, didn't

11

complain about it, never sued over the next couple of

12

years to throw the Commission out of the space that wasn't

13

being paid for, the landlord sued in the claims court and

14

thought that he had either an implied contract from the

15

government to pay for this extra space which was being

16

occupied or he had a constitutional claim for a taking of.

17

his property without payment of compensation.

18

What this Court said was, analyzing it under the

19

Tucker Act, when Congress said you could have $4,000 to

20

rent space, that's what Congress meant.

21

not authorize the occupancy of any space beyond what

22

$4,000 would buy.

23

space by an agency of the federal government was

24

unauthorized governmental activity and at best was a tort

25

that was not compensate — compensable in the claims court

And Congress did

Therefore, the occupation of additional

1

either as an implied contract or as a constitutional

2

remedy for a taking of property by the government.

3

was not authorized governmental conduct.

This

And, as I said, when this Court decided the

4
5

Regional Rail Reorganization Act cases a decade or so ago

6

and examined some of the early precursors to this

7

reorganization of the transportation statutes, it quoted

8

from the Hooe case with approval on just what is

9

authorized governmental action and what is not.

10

QUESTION:

Well, then, if I own some land with a

11

stream flowing through it and the Corps of Engineers goes

12

on that land and builds a dam and diverts the water, I

13

don't have a Tucker — an inverse condemnation action if

14

it turns out that action of the Corps of Engineers was not

15

authorized by Congress?

16

MR. BERGER:

Your Honor, that's what this Court

17

has said.

Candidly, I'm not all comfortable with some of

18

those opinions but I think that they are there.

19

say, as recently as the Regional Rail cases this Court

20

quotes that line of authority — with approval — saying

21

that in effect has carved out a branch of actions which

22

the Court says are not actions of the government but are

23

actions by government officials unauthorized by Congress,

24

and the remedy for those actions is not in the claims

25

court.

And as I

QUESTION:

1

Well, in this case the prohibition of

2

against expenditures of the money may have referred to

3

expenditures other than expenditures for takings, i.e.,

4

staff to negotiate these easements and so forth.

5

think you necessarily can construe this statute as

6

applying only to payments for takings.

7

MR. BERGER:

I don't

Justice Kennedy, I don't construe

8

it only as applying to that.

I construe it as applying

9

across the board to*takings as well as to all of the other

10
11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BERGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

But my point is —
— and other needs by —
— the language, it seems to me, can

be given some effect and still allow a Tucker Act claim.

15

MR. BERGER:

Certainly it could be given some

16

effect.

17

that the statute, as written, doesn't lend itself to that

18

sort of an interpretation.

19

which, it seems to me, is a clear indication of what the

20

slim legislative history in this case reflects.

21

is that what Congress wanted to do was to create these

22

trails if it could do so without spending money.

23

had to spend money, I don't think Congress was interested

24

in this —

25

I can't quarrel with that.

QUESTION:

But it seems to me

It's a broadly written statute

And that

If it

Well, what if we agree with the

1

Solicitor General and think you do have a Tucker Act

2

remedy?

3

on a different ground?

4

What do we do in this case?

MR. BERGER:

Affirm the judgment

Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly

5

think it would have to be with a very different approach

6

than the one that the Second Circuit took because what the

7

Second Circuit said was that under no circumstances do we

8

have a taking here which anybody could remedy.

9

So that if the Court were to agree that there is

10

a Tucker Act remedy available here, there would certainly

11

have to be some dealing with that issue and a clear

12

expression from the Court that that in fact is what the

13

underlying fee property owners in these trail conversions

14

are supposed to be doing and —

15

QUESTION:

16

Vermont law is as yet, do we?

17
18

MR. BERGER:

Well, we also don't know what the

Well, it's been cited to the Court

but there certainly has been no determination —

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BERGER:

Right.
— in this case.

Both the ICC and

21

the Second Circuit simply assumed that Mr. and Mrs.

22

Preseault had the interest that they claimed, that there

23

would be an interference with it, but that it did not

24

present a Fifth Amendment problem.

25

QUESTION:

Suppose — suppose there is a

property with a railroad easement on it and a reversion,

2

the reversion to take effect when the easement is no

3

longer used for railroad purposes, and the ICC says, we're

4

pretty sure that this route will be used in 25 years and

5

therefore we do not allow an abandonment.

6

taking of the property?

7

MR. BERGER:

No, Your Honor.

Is that a

That's an entirely

8

different situation.

What we would have there, Justice

9

Kennedy, is an application of the existing regulatory

10

scheme as it is intended to operate and as the fee owners

11

underlying these rail easements understand it to operate.

12

And that is that the ICC determines whether in a

13

particular case abandonment of the right of way is

14

appropriate.

15

Please recall that what we have in this case,

16

however, is something which is wholly different.

17

ICC decided there would be no abandonment, then the

18

tracks, the ties, the bridges, the trestles, they all

19

remain in place, and the railroad is responsible for

20

maintaining them if it wants to hold on to that

21

possibility of reactivating the rail line in 25 years.

22

If the

What we have in a Trails Act conversion is that

23

the abandonment is in fact approved.

What the ICC says is

24

we don't need this property for railroad use anymore, you

may go forth, tear up the tracks —

3

QUESTION:

Including future railroad use, based

on what you've told us earlier that the statute requires?
MR. BERGER:

The statute is very clear that the

4

ICC in authorizing abandonment must consider whether there

5

is any future railroad need for this property, and if it

6

finds that there is, it must deny the abandonment.

7

In this case, of course —

8

QUESTION:

Do railroads ever remove tracks and

9

trestles and ties but keep the right of way because of the

10

possibility of future use, i.e., that they'd then lay down

11

new, more modern tracks and so forth?

12

MR. BERGER:

I suppose they could do that, Your

13

Honor, and I'm sure in some cases that in fact happens.

14

Whether it happens in cases where they owned only a right

15

of way for railroad purposes, I sincerely doubt.

16

I think where you have that situation you would

17

find it where the railroad had bought fee title to the

18

right of way area and wanted to clear its tracks off.

19

When the ICC authorizes abandonment, it

20

authorizes full abandonment.

21

discontinuance in service, the tracks, ties, trestles,

22

bridges all remain in place for reactivation.

23

When it authorizes a

What we have here in this situation is somewhat

24

of a — a different angle because the railroad in question

never asked anybody for permission to stop running along

this route.

They simply stopped 14 years ago, tore up the

2

ties and tracks and put them to other use, and when Mr.

3

and Mrs. Preseault decided that they had had enough and

4

they wanted to clear their title to the land and they went

5

to the ICC to ask the ICC to declare a de facto

6

abandonment here, the railroad stepped in and said, oh,

7

yes, by the way, why don't you approve what we did ten

8

years ago.

9

The situation is a little off the norm

10

factually, but all of those facts are really sort of only

11

in broad brush in the record here because no court has

12

ever examined what the facts are in this case.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Berger, do you have any idea how

14

— how expensive a pig in the poke this statute would have

15

been if — if indeed it's to be interpreted the way the

16

government says as simply authorizing the taking of land

17

and we'll pay the bill later when it's presented?

18

have any idea how much —

Do you

Justice Scalia —
— how much money you're talking

about for all these rights of ways that —
MR. BERGER:

I honestly don't, Justice Scalia.

23

All I can tell you is that the — what the record does

24

reflect is that approximately 3,000 miles of right of way

25

are being abandoned every year and that that was one of

1

the reasons why the trail organizations wanted to get

2

Congress involved in this and why there was such a

3

nationwide interest, because this is happening in many

4

states around the country.
But at 3,000 miles a year, some of this land is

5
6

quite valuable.

The case that's before the Court today

7

involves a right of way that runs essentially along the

8

It is the more common, as I

understand what has happened in these cases, Your Honor.

16

The railroads in many cases — in many states, rather,

17

including Vermont, were essentially forbidden either by

18

statute or by case law from acquiring anything other than

19

an easement for right of way purposes.

20

skimpy legislative history of this program where the

Congressional Budget Office examined the rails-to-trails

program and the other amendments to the Trails Act in 1983

5

and concluded, with the concurrence of the House committee

6

that examined it, that the funding required for all of

7

these amendments would be, in their words, insignificant.

8

And I would suggest to you that almost any value

9

you placed upon 3,000 miles of right of way every year is

10

going to be something more than insignificant even in the

11

context of determining the federal budget.

The point being, and the ICC's reports bear this

out, that where the railroad owns fee title, the railroad

has always been free to transfer its interest to a state

that it wanted to.

7

QUESTION:

Well, but doesn't this statute set

forth a policy to encourage the ICC to work with the

railroads to do that?

The statute says it encourages the

ICC to do that.

The Court could affirm the decision of the ICC,

grounds.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN K. DUNLEAVY

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE PETITIONER

MR. DUNLEAVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13

please the Court, on behalf of my client, the State of

14

Vermont, and its fellows respondents, the City of

15

Burlington and Vermont Railway, I urge this Court in the

event it finds petitioner's taking claim right for review

17

to hold that the Petitioners are not deprived of any

18

property interest by Section 1247(d).
In essence, we submit to the Court that Section

19
20

1247(d) takes nothing and changes nothing.

our view and that taken by the Petitioners in this case,

QUESTION:

If under state law a reversionary

2

interest would be recognized and the federal government

3

has somehow legislated and acted so as to take that

4

reversionary interest, why isn't compensation required?

5

MR. DUNLEAVY:

The action of the federal

government, although it could not obviously have been

specifically predicted, is occurring in an atmosphere

8

where the possibility of government regulation under the

9

Commerce Clause has always existed.

acting under the Commerce Clause the federal government

12

can avoid always having any takings problem?

or the condition of title may vary from state to state,

and in fact may be unknown, what is clear is that the

servitude, it does not result in a taking.

anticipate the presence of 80,000 pound motor trucks,

15

they did understand that their land was being appropriated

The only thing that is different here is that

Congress could have taken the heavy-handed approach that

said simply, we're going to preserve all rail corridors

and we're going to make the rail carriers bear the expense

15

of that.
