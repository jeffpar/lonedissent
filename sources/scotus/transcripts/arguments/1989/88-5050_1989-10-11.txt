ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD S. HONCHELL

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. HONCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Daniel Holland in this cause faced criminal charges in

11

the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, and he elected

12

trial by a jury, as assured by the Sixth Amendment to the

13

United States Constitution.

14

select that jury, the state used its peremptory challenges to

15

exclude both of the eligible blacks from service on the jury.

16

This case, therefore, involves the need to provide white

However, in the process used to

17

defendants with a remedy to challenge such a process.

18

process in which black prospective jurors are removed by a

19

peremptory challenge on the unjustified false assumption that

20

as blacks they are unqualified to serve, endangers recognized

21

essential values of jury trial, as contemplated by this Court

22

under the Sixth Amendment.

23

A

This Court now prohibits the unfair selection of the

24

venire based on the false assumption as to disqualifications

25

of blacks due to group membership, and the Petitioner simply

asks that this court equally prohibit the unfair process in

2

the voir dire selection.

3

This Court has barred the state from interfering with the

4

fair possibility that the cross-section reaches the petit jury

5

at the outset of the jury selection process in the formulation

6

of the jury roles and the jury rosters.

7

assumed that with the random selection the fair possibility

8

will reach the venire from which the petit jury will be

9

selected.

This Court has

And this Court simply cannot allow the

10

Prosecutor to do in a single trial what the government is

11

barred from doing on the basis of the decisions of this Court.

12

QUESTION:

Well, would you say a prosecutor could

13

challenge two black jurors out of six black jurors?

14

is a 12-man -- 12-person jury and six of the -- six of the

15

jurors drawn from the -- six of the petit jurors drawn are

16

black, could the prosecutor strike two of them as long as the

17

resulting jury represented

18

MR. HONCHELL:

Say there

a cross -- a fair cross-section?

The issue in the case is protecting the

19

process of selecting the jury, and in that situation, where

20

individuals are removed by peremptory challenge on the basis

21

of their race on the false assumption that they are

22

unqualified, that is injury to the process and —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

No.

That's not a fair cross-section argument.

That's an equal protection argument of some kind, isn't it?
MR. HONCHELL:

The fair cross-section argument has to be

2

understood in a — in a very broad perspective.
QUESTION:

But what if the prosecutor says, I'm

3

interested in having a fair cross-section jury?

4

all the — suppose just by chance the jury turned out to be

5

all black?

6

that or not?

7

I want a fair cross-section jury.

All the --

Could he do

I guess not, on your thesis.

MR. HONCHELL:

Yes.

He would be barred from using

8

peremptory challenges to remove otherwise qualified jurors,

9

black jurors, on the false assumption that because of their

10

11

race they're not qualified to serve.
QUESTION:

Well, how does that give you a fair

12

cross-section jury if -- if --Justice White's hypothesis is

13

that out of 12 there are 12 blacks?

14

MR. HONCHELL:

If the -- if the prosecutor is allowed to

15

use his peremptory challenges simply on the basis of his false

16

assumptions and his biases, it is a severe injury to the

17

selection process.

18

the selection process need not result in a fair cross-section

19

in your view?

20

MR. HONCHELL:

And that is the key to — QUESTION:

Well, that is -- that is true.

Yes.

But

The

21

-- the -- issue is the prohibition against misusing peremptory

22

challenges to remove the fair possibility of a cross-section

23

on the jury.

24
25

Now, a defendant would have the obligation to demonstrate
that the prosecutor's removal was based on the membership and

1

therefore was based on the prohibited false assumptions.

2

it may -- in possible situations he would be unable to make

3

that demonstration from all the facts and circumstances that

4

the challenges were based on race.
QUESTION:

5

You're not making a claim here, I take it,

6

that there is some systematic exclusion of black jurors

7

throughout the county?

8

MR. HONCHELL:

9

12

And

That — that —that's correct.

There is

no evidence in — in the record on this — on this -- in this
case.

The —
QUESTION:

That claim would be open to you under existing

precedence, presumably, if the facts warranted it?

13

MR. HONCHELL:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HONCHELL:

Yes.

The —

With respect to the venire.
Yes.

The issue in this case is the

16

process of — of choosing from the venire those jurors who are

17

going to serve as the truly representative voice of the

18

community.

19

on what a jury must do, the function that a jury serves, and

20

the process of selecting that jury.

QUESTION:

Does this objection apply only to racial

distinctions?
MR. HONCHELL:

The -- the issue of -- of what groups it

— it --it — it would apply to is -- is an open question.

25

It's -- it's -- it's difficult, as this Court recognized in

Lockhart v. McCree, to specify what groups qualify for

examination.

3

analysis that has to be limited.

4
5

QUESTION:

And we think that it's a — it's -- it's an

Of course, one way -- one easy way of limiting

it is to — automatically is to say that only blacks —

6

MR. HONCHELL:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Yes.

-- can object to the elimination of blacks.

That -- that — that you know —
MR. HONCHELL:

Well, yes, that's been done, and — and

10
11

QUESTION:

That eliminates a lot of problems, doesn't it?

12

But you're saying anybody can object to the elimination of any

13

group, right?

14
15
16

MR. HONCHELL:

We're saying in this case that whites have

the authority to object to blacks.
QUESTION:

Right.

And I suppose rich people could object

17

to the exclusion of rich people.

18

could object -not only to the exclusion of rich people, but

19

even to the exclusion of poor people.

20

MR. HONCHELL:

Not only the -- I mean,

If rich people and poor people are -- are

21

distinctive groups for purposes of determining damage to the

22

system from its removal on the basis of that characteristic,

23

and whether there is a showing that they were removed on the

24

basis of that characteristic.

25

So the quest is really twofold.

First of all, are we

.

1

dealing with the distinctive group whose removal should be of

2

concern, and, secondly, is there a demonstration that the

3

removal was based on that membership?

4
5
6

QUESTION:

How do we go about deciding the first

question?
MR. HONCHELL:

I'd -- I would refer the Court to Lockhart

7

which is a — which is an indication that it's difficult

8

because this Court never said in Lockhart what groups or what

9

distinctive --

10

QUESTION:

Well, there's also rather strong in Lockhart,

11

isn't there, that the fair cross-section applies only to the

12

venire and not to the panel?

13

MR. HONCHELL:

Yes.

Yes.

That is a -- there is a

14

discussion there, but we would argue that that has — has

15

misconstrued what we contend is a fair cross-section

16

requirement because that seems to suggest that there is a

17

mandatory affirmative duty to include, which is unworkable and

18

unsound to apply to the petit jury.

19

asking that that concept be used.

20

And we're certainly not

What we propose as a fair cross-section requirement is

21

that assuming that there is the affirmative obligation at the

22

outset, that there remain the fair possibility thereafter that

23

what this Court has considered worthy of inclusion last

24

throughout the system and actually sits on the jury.

25

So, we would argue that the fair cross-section

1

requirement is prohibitory, that the prosecutors are

2

prohibited from removing cognizable groups or distinctive

3

groups on false assumptions because it minimizes the fair

4

possibility of serving on the -- on the jury.
But going to the assumption that there is such a fair

5
6

cross-section argument, the Court in Lockhart did decide,

7

attempted to decide and define what a distinctive group was.

8

The Court —

9

QUEST10N:

Excuse me.

What are -- what are false

10

assumptions?

11

about a venire, I — I suppose you can say there are false

12

assumptions when you're talking about any group.

13

only basis for excluding is you think that they're -- they're

14

too biased or too stupid or something else, to be jurors at

15

all.

16

You say false assumptions.

When you're talking

You -- the

But when you're down to a particular case, what is wrong

17

with a prosecutor striking a particular people because they're

18

rich?

19

I think I'd stand a better chance of getting a -- getting a

20

conviction if I excluded rich people, if I had a poor-person

21

jury.

I mean, the prosecutor says, these are rich defendants;

The prosecutors make judgments like that all the time.

22

MR. HONCHELL:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HONCHELL:

25

Yes, but the -- the false assumption is —

So it's not a false assumption then.
There is a false assumption that all rich

people are necessarily biased and will be biased in this case

1

and, therefore, I may —I may exclude a person simply because

2

he --

3

QUESTION:

He doesn't exclude that at all -- that isn't

4

his assumption at all.

5

better than even.

6

than even that a -- that a rich person will be more

7

sympathetic to a rich defendant and he therefore wants to

8

strike the person.

9

challenges are all about?

10

MR. HONCHELL:

His assumption is the chances are

It's not at all -- the chances are better

Isn't that exactly what -- what peremptory

That's -- that's -- that's correct, but

11

the question becomes is that a constitutional peremptory

12

challenge as this Court has come to define it most especially

13

in the Batson case.

14

black defendant is unqualified to serve; he'll -- he'll be

15

more partial to a black defendant.

16

use a peremptory to strike a black.

17

The assumption in Batson was, well, the

Therefore, I can properly

And this Court has said, no, we -- we cannot allow

18

prosecutors to make generalizations and generalities simply on

19

this distinctive qualification.

20

QUESTION:

If you're really -- if you're really honest

21

about your principle, peremptory challenges in general — the

22

whole notion of a peremptory challenge is contrary to having a

23

fair cross-section, isn't it, because the whole purpose of it

24

is to eliminate a fair cross-section and somehow load the jury

25

in such a way that it's more likely to be in your favor.

1

Isn't that exactly what a peremptory challenge is for?

2

MR. HONCHELL:

The — the proper use of peremptory

3

challenge is — is to supplement challenges for cause in order

4

to remove those who are for particular reasons that the

5

prosecutor simply cannot articulate, or, more importantly,

6

cannot convince the judge -- renders this person unqualified

7

to serve.

8
9

QUESTION:

But those reasons are very often

generalizations about -- you -- you -- you can't know the

10

person individually so you make generalizations, often on the

11

basis of race, religion, appearance, you know, manner of

12

dress, job.

13

the whole system is built on generalization.

14

And, you know, it may be a false assumption, but

MR. HONCHELL:

Yes, and this is the tension between

15

peremptory challenges and the fair selection of the jury.

16

this Court must integrate those two opposing concerns.

And

17

There is a recognition from this Court when the

18

peremptories are used against blacks that the defendant is

19

entitled to demonstrate that the decision to exclude was based

20

on a false assumption that just because the person was black

21

-- and for no other reason -- nothing having to do with his

22

income, which his status, with his marital state -- with

23

absolutely no other evaluations whatsoever you decided that

24

this person cannot serve on the jury because he's black.

25

This Court said, well, that's not a constitutional

peremptory challenge because there are limitations that are

2

presented by this use of the peremptory challenge.

3

dangers, there are limitations and frustrations that are

4

introduced which this court must correct.

5

There are

And under that analysis and under that assumption this

6

Court simply should not allow peremptory challenges to

7

overrule, to override the commitment of this Court to a

8

selection process which is designed to assure the fair

9

possibility that the cross-section will actually serve on the

10
11

jury.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, in your hypothetical I noticed

you used martial status and wealth as being permitted grounds

for disqualification.

What principle

1

could you recommend to us or propose that allows us to say

2

that only blacks are protected by the fair cross-section

3

requirement?

4

MR. HONCHELL:

It would be based on this Court's

5

recognition that the removal of blacks by peremptory challenge

6

suggests that prosecutors are misusing the challenges to

7

remove on grounds of rights.

9

QUESTION:

Well, that gets back to Justice White's

original question, that this isn't the fair cross-section

10

argument you're making at all.

11

protection argument.

12

There has been —

MR. HONCHELL:

It's simply an equal

The argument has elements of equal

13

protection analysis to it because there is the concern for the

14

excluded jurors.

15

But there's, also concerns beyond the equal protection

16

analysis that benefits the jurors.

17

defendant's right to have his guilt or innocence judged by a

groups in the community, the value of the system in having it

So, there are these factors which — in addition to the

concerns for the feelings and attitudes of the excluded

jurors.

5

QUESTION:

I suppose you would apply this same approach

to civil trials in the federal courts?
MR. HONCHELL:

If this Court could determine that the

6

Sixth Amendment applied in the civil context, that in fact the

7

Sixth Amendment was applicable to civil -

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HONCHELL:

10

How about the Seventh Amendment?
The Seventh Amendment demonstrates that

there is a --

QUESTION:

Certainly there is a right to a jury trial.

12

MR. HONCHELL:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HONCHELL:

— a right to a jury trial, yes.

In the federal courts.
The difficulty -- the difficulty,

15

unfortunately, is that the Sixth Amendment — or not so

16

unfortunately -- but the difficulty is that the violation

17

under the Sixth Amendment comes from the governmental

18

interference, whereas under the Seventh Amendment there would

19

be interference by a second private counsel or an opposing

20

litigant as —

QUESTION:

Well, I know.

But your rationale would surely

apply.

Nobody should be able to take a person off the jury on

MR. HONCHELL:

The argument we present is that certainly

1

the government is not entitled to do so.

2

certainly a value to applying this to the civil -- civil

3

branch.

4

this case and it may need to await analysis and argument in

5

civil courts.

6

And there is

It's certainly not an issue that's been developed in

QUESTION:

Counsel, what do you do with Negroes who are

7

passing for white?

8

MR. HONCHELL:

How do you get to them?
It puts the burden on the defendant to

9

demonstrate that this is a member of the -- of the Black race.

10

And, in addition, he's being excluded on grounds of membership

11

in that race.

12

If the defendant can't demonstrate that these individuals

13

are members of what he argues to be and persuades the court to

14

be a distinctive group, then there's no analysis on their

15

removal.

16

So, it would depend on the local judges who are able to

17

determine from all the facts and circumstances whether these

18

are members of the congnizable group or the distinctive group.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

It's a fast way to get an all-white jury,

isn't it?
MR. HONCHELL:

The concern is not what kind of jury is

22

gotten.

The concern is the process in getting the jury

23

itself.

And we're advocating that this Court simply protect

24

the process of selecting the petit jury from a venire which is

25

already protected by this Court's decisions selected from the
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

jury roles, which is also protected by this Court's decision.

2

So we've certainly discovered the weak link in this

3

process of jury selection, because this Court has insisted

4

that the system function to assure an eventual jury which will

5

protect the defendant as a hedge against the prosecutors and

6

the government, against arbitrary power by ensuring the

7

common-sense views of the community, by assuring that the

8

system functions and does so with respect.

9

And yet, the prosecutor, despite this Court's commitment

10

to that kind of a jury selection system, can simply use a

11

peremptory challenge and thereby evade at the petit jury at

12

the voir dire stage what this Court has demanded as a ban at

13

earlier stages of the jury process.

14

QUESTION:

That stretches what we've said so far.

I

15

mean, it certainly would be a rational system to say that you

16

have to have a fair cross-section for the venire simply to

17

make sure that both sides enter into this lottery that is

18

peremptory challenges on a fair basis, a level playing field.

19

You start off with a venire that is a fair cross-section.

20

After that, each side gets its peremptories.

21

insisting that a fair cross-section come out of the thing.

22

That's very unlikely with only 12 people on the jury anyway.

23

MR. HONCHELL:

24

QUESTION:

25

We're not

Yes.

MS. FRYKLUND:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

2

Court, the question presented today is whether the Sixth

3

Amendment regulates the use of peremptory challenges during

4

voir dire.

Our position is that it does not.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to trial by

5
6

jury, which as this Court has said in numerous decisions, the

7

fundamental purpose of trial by jury is to prevent oppression

8

by the government.

9

only this trial by jury, but trial specifically by an

And, furthermore, we're guaranteed not

10

impartial jury.

11

Amendment is on this end result of an impartial jury.

So, I believe the focus of the Sixth

12

Counsel suggested in the course of his argument today

13

that the outcome of the composition of the jury is somehow

14

less important than the process and that this Court should be

15

focusing primarily on process.

16

absolutely incorrect.

17

touchstone of the Sixth Amendment, which is the impartial

18

jury.

19

I think that that is

We must always be looking at the

The Sixth Amendment purposes of achieving an impartial

20

jury are achieved in practice by a sequence of stages that

21

begins with the broadly-based jury pool which must be drawn

22

from a cross-section of the community.

23

sometime later in an individual courtroom in which a

24

prosecutor and an individual defendant and his attorney -- two

25

adversaries —■ are mutually engaged in the process of picking

And the process ends

1

an impartial jury of six, or, as in Illinois, 12 jurors.

2

the choices at all stages of the process are, of course,

3

constrained by the Equal Protection Clause.

4

And

Now, the broad -- we believe that the very broad mix of

5

all the distinctive groups on the jury pool is directly and

6

casually related to the overriding purpose of preventing

7

oppression by the government.

8

Given that it's the government which by definition is a

9

party to every criminal case, which is solely in control of

10

all the mechanisms of jury summoning and recruitment, it is

11

vital that the government not be able to manipulate or

12

gerrymander the jury pool.

13

Thus, at the time the government is making its decision

14

to indict, which usually comes some weeks or even months ahead

15

of the actual trial date, the government is constrained in

16

making its charging decision by the knowledge that it has no

17

control over who is going to be able to appear on the venire,

18

and potentially any member of the community could appear to

19

try the case.

20

I think this is why even if the particular defendant

21

ultimately opts for a bench trial this broadly-based jury pool

22

has served a very vital function for keeping the government

23

honest.

24
25

As Justice Scalia pointed out earlier, if the jury pool
is broadly-based with nobody in particular eliminated, at the

2

they're both on a level playing field.

3

to bias the direction of the venire.

4

Neither has been able

Then, when the trial date for an individual case arrives

5

and the two individual parties enter the courtroom, the

6

government is no longer in control of the process.

7

government has switched hats.

8

9

— or, removes jurors for cause, and the two parties -- and in

The

Now the government is one party

And at this stage the judge exercises

10

Illinois the two parties have the same number of peremptory

11

challenges, it's now seven -- the two parties jointly act to

12

pick a jury.

13

And they do this by each side acts to remove the

14

individual people whom it suspects are going to be least

15

favorable to consideration of its own side.

16

It is our position that at this stage, in the midst of

17

voir dire, that the demographic composition of the jury which

18

is ultimately chosen, or the composition of the array of

19

people who have been excused, is absolutely irrelevant to any

20

purpose which is protected by the Sixth Amendment.

21

Therefore, whether petitioner is talking about having a

22

quota of some representatives of the community on his petit

23

jury or, as he spoke in his brief, about a fair possibility

24

that some particular distribution would obtain, or whether, as

25

he emphasized in argument today, that we have to look to

1

someone's motivation for particular choices -- however it is

2

he phrases, we believe that under the Sixth Amendment his

3

claim fails at the very threshold because the group membership

4

of individual impartial people is absolutely irrelevant to

5

anything and should not be the basis for a cognizable claim.

6

In fact, since this goal of impartiality is logically

7

independent of the race, socioeconomic class, ethnic origin,

8

or any other personal characteristic of the individual jurors,

9

any sort of rule of selection or any prohibition on what the

10

government can do in selection that's based on anything other

11

than impartiality is bound to go counter to the expressed

12

values of the Sixth Amendment which is the goal of

13

impartiality.

14

So, our position is the only time at which a defendant is

15

entitled to a fair cross-section of the community is the point

16

at which the names go into the box for selecting the venires.

17

That's the end of it.

with certainty that he was perfectly satisfied with the

impartiality of his jury.

he wants not just impartiality, but impartiality plus.

So, the Equal Protection Clause is

When he talks about, as he does in his brief, about how

MR. HONCHELL:

Thank you, your Honor.

I believe the

Court must assure that whatever the luck of the draw, the

6

defendant has the right to a fair process which permits the

fair cross-section as much as humanly and legally possible to

reach the issue — to reach the jury.

9

This Court has never focused merely on the end result.

10

It has looked to the process involved because that's valuable.

11

This Court has never merely assumed the Sixth Amendment is

12

satisfied by an impartial jury or a fair trial because that

13

doesn't assure that there's a fair system involved.
