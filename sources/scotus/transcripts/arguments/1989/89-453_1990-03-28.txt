CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission.

Mr. Guillot.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY H. GUILLOT

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. GUILLOT:

This case involves the FCC's

10

policies of awarding substantial preferences in

11

comparative licensing proceedings to certain minority and

12

female applicants for new television and radio broadcast

13

stations throughout the United States.

14

Metro in 1982 filed its application for a construction

15

permit for a new UHF television station at Channel 60 in

16

Orlando, Florida but ultimately lost in the comparative

17

contest due to Rainbow Broadcasting Company, the

18

Respondent intervenors', enhancement credits for minority

19

and female ownership composition.

20

The Petitioner

This outcome, along with the preferential

21

treatment policies resulting in it, was upheld by the U.S.

22

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit by a

23

2-1 decision.

24
25

The lower court's holding had followed an
initial remand in the case and the remand of the record in

1

the case as part of an active investigation into the

2

factual statutory and constitutional underpinnings of the

3

Commission's preference policies.

4

Commission had held all cases in abeyance, including the

5

present one, pending its determination regarding whether

6

the policies were ordinarily tailored and otherwise

7

constitutional.

8

9

During the remand, the

But in 1987 the Congress passed an
appropriations act defunding the Commission's inquiry and

10

specifically directing that this case be decided in

11

accordance with the minority and female preferences that

12

existed prior to the remand.

13

The issues presented in the case are twofold:

14

One, whether the Commission's policies of awarding the

15

preferences, which were created absent any findings of

16

past discrimination and for the sole purpose of promoting

17

program diversity, violate the equal protection component

18

of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

19

And secondly, whether the congressional

20

entrenchment of the communications -- the Federal

21

Communications Commission's policies and its other

22

associated actions in the appropriations act violated the

23

equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment or exceeded

24

its authority, whatever authority it has under the

25

Fourteenth Amendment.

This case is unlike other so-called affirmative

1
2

action cases which this Court has heard in the past.

3

Unlike the model program approved in Fullilove or the

4

academic admissions system hypothetically approved by the

5

Court in Bakke, in this case the preference programs of

6

the FCC have resulted in actual discrimination against

7

Metro Broadcasting which, importantly, is a corporation

8

comprised of both a minority member and nonminority

9

members.
Unlike the program under review in Fullilove,

10
11

the programs reviewed in Wygant or Croson, the FCC's

12

preference policies are not founded on the remedying of

13

past discrimination but upon the pursuit of program

14

diversity, an amorphous concept which, as we shall

15

examine, has intense First Amendment implications as well.

16

Unlike the other programs reviewed by this Court

17

in the past, three separate governmental entities, not

18

just one, have had a hand in establishing or perpetuating

19

the Commission's policies:

20

Congress.

21

the courts, the FCC and the

But regardless of these distinctions between

22

this case and past cases, one thing is for certain; and

23

that is, that the Commission's policies impose race,

24

gender and ethnic-based classifications and that those

25

classifications, we feel, are presumptively invalid but,

MR. GUILLOT:

7

QUESTION:

8

Excuse me, Mr. —
— is diversity of perspective —

Excuse me, Mr. Guillot.
Yes, Justice Scalia.

Is — is — is it clear that the

gender-based issue is necessarily before us here?
MR. GUILLOT:

9

It is absolutely clear, in our

10

opinion, that the gender-based issue is -- is before the

11

Court for several reasons.
First of all, the lower court did not consider

12

13

gender.

14

because of dicta contained in the Commission's denial of

15

Metro's application for review that said that the

16

minority — it was not clear that the gender preference,

17

being only a 5 percent one, was dispositive in the case.

18

It only considered the minority preferences

However, on remand, in an actual order of the

19

Commission, which we feel is what this Court should

20

review, the Commission held that the minority and female

21

preferences together were dispositive, and that was the

22

holding of the review board as well.

23

This Court is to review judgments, we feel, as

24

Justice Stevens pointed out in Fullilove at page 411, note

25

6, and Black v. Cutler Labs, and not just statements such

1

as the one accompanying the Commission's denial of Metro's

2

application for review.

3

But there is -- there is a more important

4

reason, Your Honor, and that is that in this case, as we

5

shall examine, the minority and female preferences are

6

pitted together in a comparative licensing proceeding.

7

They are not -- neither one of them -- are considered

8

separately, and you really can't examine one without

9

examining the other.

And you can't really examine the

10

tailoring of the program without examining how the

11

two -- the two preferences fit together, both the gender

12

and the minority and ethnic preferences.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

You wouldn't win if we just found the

racial preferences invalid?
MR. GUILLOT:

Is that what you're saying?

It's a close call, Your Honor.

16

feel that we would, but what — but the more important

17

thing is what the result would be for the Commission's

18

comparative process and the remainder of the people that

19

have to go through it for the next few years.

20

reason, the minority preference classification is struck

21

by this Court as invalid but the gender classification

22

stands, then people are going to start searching for a

23

difference in the rationale between the two policies.

give sweeping decisions if they don't affect your

1

particular case.

2

Are you saying that it would be sufficient for

3

your case to decide solely the minority preference and not

4

the female preference?

5

MR. GUILLOT:

Actually, it would not, Your

6

Honor, because Metro prevailed on the — on the other

7

criterion recognized by the Commission below, particularly

8

local residence and civic participation.
Now the -- the minority enhancement policies

9
10

have the -- the minority enhancement credit has the same

11

weight as the weight given for local residence, so that

12

neutralized the local residence factor in this case.
In order to understand why Metro still lost, the

13
14

female preference has to defeat the civic participation

15

credit which Metro received in the case, and that is the

16

only thing to explain why all of Metro's comparative

17

qualifications were not sufficient for it to prevail over

18

Rainbow.

19

QUESTION:

You -- you mean it's clear that the

20

Commission would have reached the same result had it not

21

given your opponent the racial preference?

22

MR. GUILLOT:

23

QUESTION:

Is that clear?

That is not clear, Your Honor.

Well, if that's not clear then we

24

can't affirm the Commission's decision if we invalidate

25

the racial preference; isn't that right?

MR. GUILLOT:

The Commission's decision, we

2

don't feel, can be — can be affirmed on any grounds, but

3

the racial and gender preferences had a synergistic effect

in the present proceeding.

5

position, and the reason this is somewhat confusing now is

6

because we have an —

7

QUESTION:

That's our — that's our

I don't think it's confusing at all.

8

It's — it was a central part of their decision, and if

9

that's invalid their decision cannot stand.

10
11

It will have

to be remanded.
Now they may on the remand apply the sexual

12

preference and come to the same result, but a remand would

13

still be necessary.

14

MR. GUILLOT:

But we -- a remand is certainly a

15

possibility, and though we don't favor one we're not

16

discounting it.

17

But unfortunately, neither the review board's

18

decision nor the Commission's decision says what the exact

19

weight was that was accorded between the minority and

20

female preferences in this case.

21

together in the same sentence and say that together they

22

resulted in the outcome.

25

gender preference was valid.

I still think, Justice Stevens,

Can you — can you answer my

question?
MR. GUILLOT:

I think that you should — you

should vote to -- to award the construction permit to

10

Metro, and if — and if it's not clear in the record as to

11

what the separate bases were for the two preferences, then

12

a remand is a possible —

13

QUESTION:

The simple answer to my question is

14

if I think the racial preference is bad and the gender

15

preference is all right, I should still vote to reverse.

16

That's what you're telling me?

17

MR. GUILLOT:

We feel that you should, Your

18

Honor, but again, we're limited by the judgment of the

19

review board and the FCC, and it's not clear that they

20

feel the same way.

consequences in not reaching the gender preference.

just told us we review judgments.

We don't have to decide

2

all the future cases that come down the line.

3

MR. GUILLOT:

That's right, Your Honor.

4

Well, a remand is a possibility, Your Honor, if

5

you were to uphold one of the preferences and not the

6

other, and we're open to that.

7

we feel that the -- that the two must be considered

8

together.

9

underlying the two preferences are the same, and the only

But as -- as we go along,

The Commission has said that the rationale

10

reason that people wanted them considered separately is

11

because no one wants to focus on the way that the two

12

policies operate together, and that is one of the burdens

13

that's imposed upon not only nonminorities but minorities

14

under the Commission's preference plan.

15

To the extent that female ownership is said to

16

contribute to program diversity and that it's valuable,

17

every time a female applicant comes against an applicant

18

that has a minority principal, that value is defeated, and

19

so there is also an impact on minorities and females that

20

have been — that are the acknowledged beneficiaries of

21

the program.

22

MR. GUILLOT:

In order to clarify these things a

23

little bit, I think it's important to look at the way that

24

these policies developed and how the weights of the two

25

policies really came about.

1

The Communications Act of 1934 gave the

2

Commission a broad public interest mandate in awarding

3

licenses for broadcast stations, and it said that in

4

making a grant of any application it was to determine that

5

the public interest would be served thereby.

6

one applicant applied for a broadcast station, a

7

comparative hearing must be held to determine which of the

8

applicants would provide the best service to the public in

9

favor of the public interest.

10

If more than

The Communications Act didn't establish any

11

criteria for rendering this determination, and after many

12

years of trial and error, in 1965 the Commission passed

13

its Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings,

14

which identified two general goals which were to govern

15

the entire licensing process.

16

The first was to effect a maximum diffusion, or

17

diversification of control of the media of mass

18

communications.

19

antitrust and First Amendment considerations.

20

presumed scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, the antitrust

21

considerations would disfavor one person or just a few

22

people having control over all of the media outlets in the

23

United States.

24
25

This was a goal that had grounds in both
Given the

The second acknowledged goal of the program is
to achieve the best practicable service to the public.

1

This criteria, unlike the diversification criterion, was

2

based on an examination of what the proposed broadcaster

3

would do for the local community, for the community of

4

license that was proposed.

5

In the old days, prior to the deregulatory era,

6

potential licensees had to go out into the communities and

7

ascertain the community needs by interviewing public

8

officials, interviewing minority groups and finding out

9

what gaps needed to be filled in programming.

10

Those

requirements are no more.
The Commission prepared criteria from the 1965

11

12

Policy Statement originally were race neutral.

13

changed, however, in 1973.

14

Circuit Court of Appeals' direction to the FCC that

15

minority ownership must be taken into account in

16

accordance with the public interest standard -- mandate of

17

the FCC.

18

was to be taken into account in the Commission's

19

comparative process, and there has been a lot of question

20

about that.

21

That

TV 9 v. FCC was the D.C.

But the decision didn't really clarify where it

The rationale for taking race into account

22

expressed in TV 9 was that there would be a maximum

23

diffusion of ownership of the media of mass communications

24

if we kind of broke up concentrations of certain

25

minority — certain majority groups in the media.

It was

a diversification-based criteria.
Pursuant thereto, the Court said that it's upon

ownership that the public policy places primary reliance

with respect to diversification of content.

program diversity, were really supposed benefits of

All of the

The FCC in 1978 did not give a preference for

10

minority ownership under the diversification criterion,

11

however, notwithstanding this language in TV 9.

12

the Commission chose to award enhancements under the best

13

practicable service criterion, a criterion not grounded in

14

whether one group has control over the media, but a

criterion grounded in a determination of which applicant

Mr. Guillot, it is true, I suppose

race.

MR. GUILLOT:

QUESTION:

That's true, Justice O'Connor.

that it would justify some remedial action.

example, for some kind of remedial action?
MR. GUILLOT:

2

Your Honor, Metro is not against

3

affirmative action programs per se, and we feel that there

4

might well be a need for remedial action.

5

there's a couple of problems.

6

QUESTION:

7

Then who could take that action?

The

Congress or the FCC or both?
MR. GUILLOT:

8

9

However,

Only Congress, Justice O'Connor,

because we feel that under Section 5 of the Fourteenth

10

Amendment, only Congress, and uniquely Congress, has that

11

broad kind of power to remedy societal discrimination.

12

But again, it would have to be discrimination — it's a

13

constraint against discrimination by the states, and it's

14

questionable, even if Congress could constrain —
QUESTION:

18

Well, Congress took some kind of

How should we view the action that Congress

MR. GUILLOT:

The action of Congress at best

19

should be viewed as an unconstitutional attempt to impose

20

a remedial action on the Commission to perpetuate these

21

policies without any findings of past discrimination.

22

QUESTION:

Should we — should we take it as a

23

given, then, that Congress was acting to achieve remedial

24

ends?

O'Connor, because as you have said in the Croson decision,

2

underrepresentation in and of itself is not evidence of

3

past discrimination, and in the 1987 hearings before

4

Congress, in the 1989 hearings before Congress regarding

5

minority ownership, it was made clear both by

6

commissioners that testified before Congress and Congress

7

that there was -- that the underrepresentation was the

8

sole indicia of the supposed past discrimination.

9

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that we had a difficult

10

time establishing that state discrimination was

11

responsible for this disparity in minority ownership,

12

couldn't the Congress, pursuant to its commerce powers or

13

pursuant to the powers it has to regulate the airwaves,

14

which essentially comes from the commerce power, simply

15

say that as a matter of sound policy we want minority

16

ownership?

17

we're acting in an area which is acknowledged to be an

18

exclusively Federal area?

19

Why do we need the Fourteenth Amendment when

MR. GUILLOT:

Well, the Fourteenth Amendment is

20

only applicable insofar as Congress perceives this as a

21

remedial measure, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

Well, but why is Congress limited to

23

the Fourteenth Amendment when it makes — when it has a

24

remedial program?

25

MR. GUILLOT:

No, Congress is limited to the

Fourteenth Amendment, we believe, when it seeks to redress

2

society-wide discrimination.
In Wygant, the Court seemed to indicate that

3
4

society-wide discrimination couldn't be taken into account

5

at all, but subsequent clarification has indicated that

6

Congress, pursuant to that unique power under Section 5 of

7

the Fourteenth Amendment, can redress society-wide

8

discrimination.

9

Again, there's no finding —

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Guillot?

11

MR. GUILLOT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?

Are you saying that Congress' power

13

under Section 5 goes further than to redress

14

discrimination caused by states, who are the ones that are

15

subject to the Fourteenth Amendment?

16

MR. GUILLOT:

It goes far enough to -- that's

17

not clear by the decisions of this Court, quite honestly,

Your Honor.

19

wide discrimination it's been stated, but on the other

20

MR. GUILLOT:

Under Bolling v. Sharpe and other

2

cases, yes, Your Honor.

And that's one problem, is if we

3

do not isolate Congress' broader remedial power, Justice

4

Kennedy, under the Fourteenth Amendment, then it is left

5

to be constrained by the Fifth Amendment as to what type

6

of distinctions it can impose.

7

QUESTION:

Has there been any argument by the

8

FCC or the competing applicants here who rest on their

9

minority credentials, has there been any argument that the

10

FCC has in any way furthered discrimination by its past

11

licensing activities?

12

13
14

MR. GUILLOT:

Absolutely not, Your Honor, and

that is clear.
The Commission testified to that effect —

15

Ronald K. Porter on behalf of the Commission in September

16

'89, already after this Court had granted our petition for

17

certiorari — that the FCC has never adopted remedial

18

rationale, that there's never been a finding of any past

19

discrimination on the part of the agency or in its

20

licensing practices or in any other way.

21

if you look at the comparative process that it would be

22

difficult for any type of discrimination to enter into it,

23

because the only criteria that you have to have besides

24

certain — or the only qualifications you have to have

25

besides certain financial and technical ones, is local

Has the FCC ever concluded that

6

their — that a prima facie case, at least, exists to show

7

some discrimination in the allocation of licenses in the

8

past?

9

MR. GUILLOT:

Your Honor, the FCC has done

10

exactly the opposite.

On countless occasions they have

11

stated in no uncertain terms that there is no remedial

12

basis for the programs whatsoever.
We feel the focus in this case needs to be on

13
14

the Commission's program diversity goal, therefore,

15

because under FCC v. Chenery, this Court really we don't

16

feel should review a position that the Commission itself

17

did not take in adopting the program.

18

QUESTION:

Well, has the FCC ever assessed

19

whether broadcasting does present presently diverse

viewpoints?

It is not assured

It can only come from the marketplace.

It's questionable whether the Commission's

policies even promote program diversity, Your Honor, a

goal that it equates with the First Amendment value of the

widest possible dissemination of information from diverse

Despite this very broad phrasing of the program

The

result in a greater degree of programming, a greater

variety of programming.

4

Now this Court has acknowledged —

QUESTION:

6

You — you don't really agree with

that anyway?

7

MR. GUILLOT:

8

QUESTION:

9

Pardon me?

You don't really agree with that

policy, either, because you just said a little time ago

that -- that, in fact, the programming will be determined

19

MR. GUILLOT:

We feel — we feel that that's

absolutely correct, Your Honor, and it's even more correct

now than it ever was before because there are more

So we feel that, really, program diversity is a

objectives of the legislation are within Congress' power,

18

and Justice Kennedy referred to the commerce clause as

19

being one possible basis for the exercise of that power;

20

but second, whether the limited use of racial and ethnic

criteria are a permissible means for Congress to carry out

its objectives within the due process clause.

significantly enough, underrepresentation is all Congress

And

underrepresentation is not enough but, more importantly in

the present case, you must realize that the Commission's

policies were in effect 18 years when Congress supposedly

ratified them.

5

If anything, the continuing existence of the

underrepresentation statistic demonstrates that the

Commission's comparative preference policies is a complete

8

and total failure in advancing either minority ownership

or diversity of programming, and when reviewing what

information Congress had before it at that time, that must

be taken into account, that the record is that the

to the gender question since it did come up.

Without the

as strong as Metro's, even if Rainbow keeps the gender

So the Commission, as it indicated in the

It's critical to understand that in this case

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT

10

11

MS. POLIVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Four times in the last 12 years this Court has

12

had occasion to consider the constitutionality of

13

government programs involving race conscious- or ethnic

14

conscious-based decisions as selection criteria.

15

Under the holdings of each of those cases, we

submit that the FCC' s comparative minority preference

policy should be sustained.

addressed in there -- in that case by Justice Powell most

closely resemble the issues presented here today.

cases involve as a compelling governmental interest the

ratification of that attempt -QUESTION:

5

What is

Ms. Polivy, are you suggesting that

6

the First Amendment requires the FCC's diversification

program?

8

MS. POLIVY:

Your Honor, the -- this Court and

9

many others and Congress have had occasion over the years,

10

starting with the Associated Press case and going unbroken

11

for almost 50 years, of acknowledging the fact that the

12

First Amendment is certainly part of the Commission's

13

requirement to diversify the ownership of broadcasting,

14

and it's through the ownership of broadcasting that

15

editorial control takes place.

16

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that this Court

17

has held that the FCC must — the First Amendment requires

the FCC to follow a diversification —

MS. POLIVY:

I think the question would come up

20

in the — in the reverse, that the FCC's foundation,

reliance upon the First Amendment as part of its reason

22

for diversity, is an appropriate First Amendment finding.

MS. POLIVY:

1

Well, that diversification is part

2

of the First Amendment, that the multiplicity of tongues

3

and the encouragement of diversity in the control of media

4

is something that the Commission properly sees as its

5

function under the Communications Act and under the First

6

Amendment.

7

QUESTION:

But now that's quite different, to

8

say that the Commission sees that as its function under

9

the Communications Act and that this Court has upheld its

10

seeing it that way.

11

the Communications Act did not provide for it, the

12

Commission would nonetheless have to do it because of the

13

First Amendment.

That's different than saying that if

QUESTION:

17

MS. POLIVY:

No, I don't, either.
I think the Court has said that

18

this is consistent with the Commission's obligation both

19

to further the First Amendment and the Communications Act,

20

and I think that's all that I'm claiming there.

21

But that the Court's holding in Bakke that

22

diversity of viewpoint is a compelling state interest in

23

the academic field would certainly be as valid or more

24

valid in the area of broadcasting where you're talking

25

about the entire Nation.

The — some of the confusion, I think, perhaps

1
2

as to the purpose is caused by the fact that the

3

Commission's justification of the race-conscious criteria

4

that it is using stems from the fact that in seeking

5

diversity of viewpoint they first identified the missing

voices.

7

-- if there was no past deprivation or exclusion there

8

would be no need to look specifically to include those

people.

To that extent, one would have to say that it is

So it's somewhat difficult to separate the

remedial from the question of diversity of viewpoint and -

11

- and ownership that the Commission is talking about.

QUESTION:

Under the Commission's rationale, I

13

take it, if there's a community with a substantial

Hispanic population, an Asian owner of the applicant gets

the race preference under the FCC statute, or must there

be some parallel between the composition of the local

community and the particular minority being given the

preference?

19

MS. POLIVY:

Justice Kennedy, the -- the

control, differences made in choice of news, in choice of
