ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE L. WAAS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. WAAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The State of Florida believes that any

12

disclosure of grand jury proceedings necessarily

13

compromises or breaches security.

14

policy choice in recognition of this matter, a policy

15

decision to structure its criminal justice system in such

16

a way so as to permanently bar witnesses and other

17

participants in the grand jury process from ever

18

disclosing testimony or evidence given to the panel in the

19

absence of a court order.

20

differs from that of the majority of the other states, and

21

indeed of the Federal Government, this does not mean that

22

Florida is constitutionally prohibited from making the

23

policy choices that it makes --

24
25

QUESTION:

Florida has made a

own testimony?

2

MR. WAAS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

3

Eleventh Circuit found the statute unconstitutional

4

insofar as it applies to a witness disclosing his own
i

5

testimony after the completion of an investigation.

6

difficulty with that decision is that it conflicts with

7

the recognition by this Court and others that the

8

interests justifying grand jury secrecy, while reduced

9

when an investigation is completed, are not eviscerated.

10

They remain whole and viable.

11

QUESTION:

The

Which -- which, as applied to a

12

witness revealing his own testimony, what is the state's

13

interest?

14

MR. WAAS:

Your Honor, the interests are

15

numerous, and they are borne of those general interests

16

that are cited on pages 12 and 13 of our brief, as well as

17

by this Court in the Douglas Oil case, with these specific

18

additions.

19

is no statute of limitations with respect to capital

20

punishment in Florida.

21

22

during that term may be picked up months or years later,

23

based upon newly discovered evidence.

24
25

Florida is a capital punishment state.

QUESTION:

Therefore, an investigation that

Well, that may be so, but why prevent

a witness from revealing his own testimony?

1

MR. WAAS:

Because if a witness may reveal his

2

own testimony, he will be able to also implicate the

3

questions that are asked.

opinion to say that the Florida statute was invalid

8

insofar as it prohibited the revelation of the questions

9

asked to the witness.

I wouldn't have read the Eleventh Circuit

MR. WAAS:

10

Your Honor, when we talk about

11

testimony, that word has a certain common understanding,

and that is when you look at a transcript of testimony

what you see are the questions asked and the answers

17

said in the transcript that which he was responding to.

18

It would include the questions as well.

You cannot siphon out the questions from the

QUESTION:

Well, suppose — supposing the

20

Florida statute had been held invalid by the Eleventh

21

Circuit only insofar as it prevented a witness from

22

disclosing his own testimony, but it also said that the

23

witness, in disclosing his own testimony, could not do it

24

in question and answer form.

25

witness could do would be either to repeat his answers or

MR. WAAS:

Your Honor, the difficulty with that

as I see it is that it begins to enter into legislative

determinations.

decision and the basis for the claim made by Mr. Smith

here, is not susceptible, necessarily, to a turning on or

MR. WAAS:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

It does not.

misconception in this case.

He can disclose the fact that he was

MR. WAAS:

No problem with either one of those

questions, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

That would be perfectly all right?

MR. WAAS:

That is correct, for this reason.

What the statute addresses is what goes on within the

QUESTION:

If that's the case, what is the state

2

interest — I'm sorry, if your answer to me is correct,

3

what is the state interest in saying that's all right, but

4

it suddenly implicates a great state interest if he adds

5

the words "and I so testified yesterday"?

MR. WAAS:

For this reason, Your Honor.

Once

Your Honor, your hypothetical may

involve — in the skeletal posture of the questions it is

16

quite possible that with respect to that case there would

17

be no triggering of the interest.

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

19

MR. WAAS:

But, as the cases which we recite in

20

our reply brief demonstrate, the fact of the absence of

21

any vitality of the interest justifying grand jury secrecy

22

in a particular case doesn't mean that the interests don't

exist to the point of overcoming a First Amendment claim.

MR. WAAS:

I said earlier —
QUESTION:

Justice Stevens asked you to give him

a hypothetical.
MR. WAAS:

Yes.

Let us assume that in the

course of his representation the grand jury were to ask,

10

with respect to a confidential informant whose name, if

11

disclosed, would implicate that confidential informant to

12

the point of risking his life.

13

With respect to Mr. Smith's testimony, he is now free, as

14

he represents in his pleadings both below and here, to not

15

only disclose his own testimony, but matters which he

16

learns while before the grand jury.

And maybe

-- won't that kill Joe Smith just as much as saying and I

MR. WAAS:

3

But, Your Honor, what has happened in

4

that case is that at that point, because he has now

learned about another person's testimony, if he were to

reveal that he would be knowingly revealing grand jury

testimony.

13

MR. WAAS:

That isn't the

That's something he learned as a

Your Honor, that is correct.

14

difficulty, though, is, as I said earlier, putting

15

parameters around a First Amendment claim.

16

QUESTION:

The

Well, but the whole law is devoted to

17

putting parameters around things.

18

effect is that although there is no evil involved in

situation A, there would be involved in situation B, and

therefore you are entitled to prohibit both of them.

that isn't our First Amendment law.

1

this Court said, as I understand this, that even though

2

the interests were not demonstrated to be viable in those

3

cases, the interests of protecting national security and

4

protecting military secrets were enough to overcome the

5

First Amendment claims in those cases, even though those

interests were not real and demonstrated for those

particular cases.
QUESTION:

this fellow who wants to reveal his own testimony.

11

wants to protect himself he can by being quiet.

testifies to a certain fact, and he is asked well, where

defend your position.
MR. WAAS:

I understand that, and I am just

3

trying to point out that with respect to the First

4

Amendment posture of the case, when you are talking about

5

the vitality of those interests and apply them to

6

particularized efforts to disclose what has become grand

7

jury information by virtue of its having been imparted,

8

then the question becomes whether it is more feasible for

9

a state to protect its own interests by prohibiting public

10

dissemination or disclosure of that which the grand jury

11

is considering and undertaking.

12

You see, once you identify the fact of the grand

13

jury's having received certain information, then

14

conjecture and speculation that is generally available

15

with respect to particularly media coverage of grand jury

16

proceedings goes by the board.

17

to retain the vitality of grand jury proceedings

18

specifically when we are dealing with, as is Florida's

19

situation, a state that is unique geographically.

20

not prepared to argue to this Court that the other 49

21

states don't have their own uniqueness, they do.

22

Florida's geography means that the types of issues that

23

are presented to a state grand jury involve matters of

international consideration, drug trafficking, --

could be said of Federal investigations for violation of

2

Federal laws in Florida.

3

MR. WAAS:

That is correct.

4

QUESTION:

But the Federal rule on disclosure of

5

grand jury testimony is not as broad as you describe

6

Florida's as being, is it?

7

MR. WAAS:

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

And indeed, application of the

9
10

Federal rule in the State of Florida would not prohibit
what Mr. Smith proposes to do.
MR. WAAS:

11

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

12

Federal rule would permit witnesses to disclose, upon

13

leaving the grand jury room, unless a protective order was

14

entered.

15

QUESTION:

And yet the, the public interest is

the same.

me to follow.

18

prohibit the witness from revealing identities of grand

19

jurors, for example, or what the witness saw there, other

20

than testimony or evidence?

statute means.

It doesn't appear to me, textually, to

mean either what you say it does or what your opponent

says it does.
MR. WAAS:

4

Your Honor, the statute prohibits

5

disclosure of testimony and evidence given to the grand

6

jury.

7
8

QUESTION:

So it wouldn't prohibit disclosure of

the identity of the grand jurors?
MR. WAAS:

9

If — if, within the context of

10

questions asked by a grand juror, the identity of the

11

grand jurors is disclosed, then, because it is testimony,

12

to that extent —
QUESTION:

13
14

doesn't prohibit it.
MR. WAAS:

15

Well, if it isn't testimony it
Right?
The statute itself does not address

16

identity of grand jurors.

17

by the grand jurors, comments made —
QUESTION:

18
19

It does address questions asked

If — if you regard those questions

as testimony, I mean, that's your theory?

20

MR. WAAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

Because it

21

comprises the common understanding of what constitutes

22

testimony.

answers, he.would get the questions and the answers

Now, it is my position that if the state, or any

entity of the state that conducts investigations, may

impose an oath of secrecy to protect the internal security

of its operations and functions, then surely a state can

enact a statute that serves the same purpose.

the prospect of not being able to protect the innocent

QUESTION:

I suppose if we said that the witness
