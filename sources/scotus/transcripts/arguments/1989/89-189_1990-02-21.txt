ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD R. GRANT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GRANT:

10
11

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The issue in this capital case is what standard

12

13

of review should a Federal habeas court apply in reviewing

14

a state court's finding that an aggravating circumstance

15

exists.

16

It's our position that once the Federal habeas

17

court has examined the aggravating circumstance and

18

determined that the state court has adopted a proper

19

narrowing construction of it, that the state court finding

20

that the aggravating circumstance exists is not generally

21

subject to Federal review.

22

the finding is so unprincipled or arbitrary as to somehow

23

violate the Constitution should that finding be reviewed

24

by a Federal habeas court.

25

QUESTION:

Only in those instances where

I suppose it would be reviewable

under the Jackson against Virginia standard at -- at any

2

rate if it were argued that there were no

could possibly or no court could possibly find him beyond

4

a reasonable doubt.

5

MR. GRANT:

That's an additional standard that

6

the dissent in the Ninth Circuit recognized.

7

standard we've mentioned in our briefs.

8

9

no juror

It's also a

However, our one problem with that is that we do
not, and this Court has not, equated aggravating

10

circumstances with findings of guilt.

11

standard does apply to standard of guilts -- findings of

12

guilt, and for that reason we would prefer the standard

13

stated in Barclay which is the -- so unprincipled or

14

arbitrary.

15

The Jackson

Briefly, in this case the Arizona trial court

16

found two aggravating circumstances in Mr. Jeffers' case.

17

He found that in committing the murder he created a grave

18

risk of death to others.

19

was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved

20

fashion.

21

He also found that the murder

In the Arizona State Supreme Court's independent

22

review of this case, it set aside the first aggravating

23

circumstance, the grave risk of death.

24

the second, it set aside the cruelty portion of it.

25

found that cruelty had not been shown beyond a reasonable

It

doubt.

It, however, affirmed the finding that he had

2

committed the murder in an especially heinous and -- and

3

depraved fashion.
Mr. Jeffers then petitioned for cert, to this

court.

Federal habeas corpus petition.

7

a number of attacks on his -- on his sentencing.

8

those attacks were that the cruel, heinous or depraved

9

aggravating circumstance was void on its face, and,

10

Cert, was denied.

He then subsequently filed a

secondly, that it was void as applied to him.
The district court ruled against him on both.

11

12

He then went to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit --

13

with regard to the first question, the Ninth Circuit,

14

relying on its prior decision in Chaney, found that the

15

circumstance was not void on its face.

16

It then went on to address the question he had

17

presented, essentially that it was void as applied to him.

18

The Ninth Circuit concluded, after reviewing some Arizona

19

cases, that the evidence presented did not meet Arizona's

20

definition of cruel, heinous or depraved, the narrowing

21

decision -- the narrowing construction that they had

22

previously found had been made by the Arizona Supreme

23

Court.

4
5

Our position that's not the -- not the

What do you think its holding was in

the Ninth Circuit?
MR. GRANT:

6

My interpretation of the Ninth

7

Circuit's holding was they first looked at Arizona's

8

definition of cruel, heinous or depraved.

9

this is properly narrowed.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GRANT:

12

Uh-huh.
They then looked at the facts and

they accepted the facts -- the historical facts --

They said, yes,

Yes.
-- concerning what Mr. Jeffers had

They accepted those as correct.
They then made their own determination of

16
17

whether those facts met the standard.

In essence, what

18

they did was resentence Mr. Jeffers.

They made their own

19

determination as to whether or not these factors -- this

20

evidence, excuse me, met the definition of the factor.
QUESTION:

21

Well, didn't the Ninth Circuit in

22

reaching that conclusion take into consideration other

23

Arizona cases in which the death penalty had not been

24

imposed?

MR. GRANT:

They looked at -- they looked at six

1

cases.

Essentially they all dealt with the cruel, heinous

2

or depraved circumstance, and I believe four of them --

3

four of the decisions were ones in which the state supreme

4

court had found that the circumstance did not apply.
Again -- and essentially what they did, besides

acting as a third level of sentencer, was to conduct a

QUESTION:

Now, what do you say the standard for

MR. GRANT:

My position is that -- is that once

15

the determination has been made that the circumstance has

been narrowly defined.

1

death penalty and that this Court — and that state courts

2

should guide and minimize, but not eliminate, the

3

discretion of the sentencing authority.
The two main decisions that I think are relevant

4
5

here from this Court are Godfrey and Maynard.

Neither of

6

those support the action taken by the Ninth Circuit.

7

Neither of those dictate the result that the Respondent

8

would like from this Court.
The problem in Godfrey and what caused this

9
10

Court to reverse Godfrey's death sentence was not that

11

this Court found that Godfrey's conduct was somehow less

12

atrocious -- I believe was the language in Godfrey -- than

13

that of other people in Georgia.

14

was that Georgia had adopted a narrowing construction of

15

their aggravating circumstance,'which is similar to

16

Arizona's.

17

than -- than heinous and depraved.

18

The problem in Godfrey

I believe they used the word atrocious rather

This Court recognized that -- that Georgia had

19

done that, they had adopted a narrowing construction.

20

problem with Godfrey, however, was that the jury who

21

sentenced Mr. Godfrey was not instructed in accordance

22

with that narrowing definition, and, therefore, their

23

finding that the circumstance existed was subject to

24

uncontrolled discretion.

25

And, secondly, on review by the state supreme

The

1

court of Georgia, the state supreme court also failed to

2

apply their own narrowing construction of the aggravating

3

circumstance.

4

Because of those two things, this Court

5

concluded that the danger of excessive discretion in an

6

unchanneled sentencing decision was too great and

7

therefore reversed Mr. Godfrey's death sentence.

8
9

In Maynard, which followed Godfrey, the problem
again was not -- or, the reason for the holding was not

10

that Mr. Maynard's conduct was somehow less atrocious or

11

less heinous than that of anyone else in Oklahoma.

12

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt a second, Mr.

13

Grant?

14

understand was applied to decide that the -- Georgia's

15

narrowing construction had not been followed?

16

be sure I get the -- what you're saying the difference

17

between Godfrey and this case is.

18

I may have lost you.

19

MR. GRANT:

Why in Godfrey -- what was the standard that you

I want to

I'm not sure I — I --

Well, I think the difference is,

20

simply by looking at the record this Court could

21

determine, number one, that the jury who sentenced Godfrey

22

were not instructed on the meaning, the narrowing

23

construction --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GRANT:

Right.
-- of the meaning of the aggravating

1

circumstance.

There wasn't any instruction to the jury.

Secondly, this Court could determine by

2

3

reviewing the Georgia Supreme Court's review of Mr.

4

Godfrey's situation, that the Georgia Supreme Court had

5

not adopted -- or, had not applied that definition.
The distinction here is that, first of all, we

6
7

have judge sentencing in Arizona, not jury sentencing.

8

The judge is presumed to know the law.
QUESTION:

9
10

But as to the second point -- is what

I'm most interest in.
MR. GRANT:

11

As to the second point, you can look

12

at the Arizona State Supreme Court's opinion and you can

13

see -- it's in the Joint Appendix at, I believe, page 69

14

and following — that they refer to the narrow definition

15

and they then proceed to apply it to Mr. Jeffers' case.
The only -- the difference here is that the

16
17

Federal court went beyond those questions, whether or not

18

there is. a definition, whether or not the definition is

19

narrow, and whether or not the definition was applied by

20

the state supreme court.

21

that this Court talked about in Godfrey and Maynard.

22

went beyond those three and essentially substituted its

23

own judgment as to what the appropriate sentence should

24

be.

25

QUESTION:

Those are the considerations

1

I'm -- I -- it's kind of a confusing opinion.

2

thought they in effect had said that the — a proper

3

reading of the narrowed definition was not applied here.

4

I'm — I'm stating it backwards.

5

don't fit the narrowed definition.
MR. GRANT:

6

But I

That the facts here

I think that's what they said.

But

7

I think the effect of that is we've looked at these facts

8

and we don't think this murder is especially heinous and

9

depraved.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GRANT:

Under the narrow definition?
Correct.

They said -- they

12

acknowledged that Arizona had applied the definition.

13

They simply disagreed with the result that Arizona had

14

reached in applying that definition.

15

It's our position that that final step,

16

disagreeing with the result, is not a Federal question

17

subject to review in habeas cases unless that finding is

18

somehow so unprincipled or arbitrary.

19

Respondent's position and, by extension, that

20

taken by the Ninth Circuit, essentially would open almost

21

every step of a state court's sentencing process in

22

capital cases to Federal review.

23

reason why Respondent's position and that taken by the

24

Ninth Circuit could not be extended to allow a Federal

25

habeas court to in effect find mitigation that the state

There is no logical

court had rejected, to allow a Federal court to in effect

1

find that mitigation, which the state court had found was
3

insubstantial and insufficient, was substantial to call

4

for a leniency, was indeed sufficiently substantial to

5

call for a leniency.

6
7

simply beyond the power of the Federal habeas court and

8

are things that the Federal court should not be doing.

9

Respondent's position also asks this Court to --

10

and their answering brief demonstrates that fairly well --

11

wants this Court to conduct a wide ranging, case-by-case

12

comparison of Arizona cases and in effect any other state.

13

All of these things, the state would submit, are

QUESTION:

Well, tell me -- tell me again why --

1415

why a -- why you think that the Jackson-type review to a

16

court or the -- by the appellate court that an aggravating

17

circumstance exists.

18

-- where -- where it's been found either in the trial

Now, that means you know what the aggravating

19

circumstance is defined as and if it -- it's an

20

application of that definition of the facts.

21

MR. GRANT:

I don't have a major problem with

22

the Jackson standard.

23

that aggravating circumstances are not equated with the

24

finding of guilt.

My only problem is the reservation

I certainly think the -Well, that's true.

I think the Jackson standard and

Because a lot of people -- a lot of

10

people, including some maybe around here, thought there

11

was going to be a terrific terrible result from Jackson.

12

But that hasn't proved to be the case, has it?

13

MR. GRANT:

I don't think so.

I think the

14

Jackson standard is -- is something -- as long as the

15

distinction between aggravation and finding of guilt is

16

maintained, I think the Jackson standard is appropriate

17

because it pays deference to the state court finding,

18

which the Ninth Circuit in this case did not do under any

19

standard.

MR. GRANT:

I disagree with what the Ninth

It then went on to

-- to discuss whether or not it was applied properly here.

14

I mean, that -- on that question, it ruled against the

15

state.

16

QUESTION:

And I thought it -- I meant to say

17

that if the Arizona court thought that on these facts that

18

circumstance existed, the whole system -- or, that whole

19

aggravating circumstance wasn't adequate to avoid an

20

arbitrary system.
MR. GRANT:

21

I don't -- I don't think they went

22

that far.

23

these facts cannot be plugged into that definition and

24

maintain a narrowing construction as to Mr. Jeffers.

don't think they related it back to the first question and

to that.
QUESTION:

4

May I ask you another question, Mr.

Grant?
In the later case, contrary to this one, the

5
6

Ninth Circuit said the circumstance is -- is void on it's

7

face, or something, didn't it?

8

MR. GRANT:

9

QUESTION:

That it's too broad?

Yes.
Now, if -- I'm not saying we should

10

-- but if we should agree with -- have that same view,

11

what do we do with this case?

12

of by the law of the case that we must assume this is a

13

valid aggravating circumstance even if we don't think it

14

is?

15

MR. GRANT:

Do we -- are we bound sort

Well, my first answer would be that

16

question is not before the Court in this case, although

17

Respondent disagrees with me.

18

QUESTION:

But it's -- it would be sort of -- if

19

this is the sole aggravating circumstance and if we're

20

convinced, based on the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in the

21

other case that it's an invalid circumstance, I find it

22

rather difficult to say we should execute this man.

6

My position is that indeed Arizona has adopted a narrowing

7

construction of the —

8

QUESTION:

MR. GRANT:

-- of the circumstance.

10

Getting back to the comments I made regarding

11

this Court's general holding since Furman, the need for

12

narrowing the class and restricting sentencing discretion

13

in capital cases, I think if you examine the Arizona

14

sentencing scheme, you'll see that Arizona has done just

15

that.

16

First of all, Arizona provides for sentencing by

17

a judge, rather than by a Jury, which this Court has noted

Arizona also requires the sentencing judge to

proportionality review.
With respect to what happened in this case, our

3

position is that the standard applied is a

4

constitutionally narrow one, that the facts fit plainly

within that definition, and in fact fit within the core of

6

that definition.

7

It's our position that the Ninth Circuit,

8

instead of acting as a Federal reviewing court,

9

essentially acted as another sentencing court.

In doing

10

so, it exceeded its authority and this Court should

11

correct the mistake, set aside that finding by the Ninth

12

Circuit, and reinstate the death penalty for Mr. Jeffers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN

18

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21

MR. LIEBMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, may

it please the Court:

22

The issues in this case have narrowed

23

considerably as a result of the briefing and particularly

24

the argument here.

25

It seems to me it is clear that both parties

1

agree that there are two questions, constitutional

2

questions, that the Court has to address in a case such as

3

this one, and it's also clear that the parties agree on

4

the standards that apply to both of those two questions.

5

What they disagree about is the answer to the first of

6

those questions.

7

The first question is whether or not Arizona's

8

definition -- Arizona has a definition of its especially

9

heinous and depraved aggravating circumstance that

10

satisfied the Eighth Amendment rule of Furman versus

11

Georgia, that it narrowed the class of death-eligible

12

first-degree murderers on the basis of an objective

13

principle.

14

That question entails an inquiry, as in both

15

Godfrey and Maynard, into first whether or not the state

16

has defined its aggravating circumstance in a

17

constitutional manner, and, secondly, whether it has

18

applied a constitutional definition in the particular

19

case.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

This --this is the point on which

the Ninth Circuit ruled against your client?
MR. LIEBMAN:

No, Your Honor.

The Ninth Circuit

23

did not rule against Mr. Jeffers on either of those

24

aspects of the Maynard and Godfrey rule.

favorable ruling to the state.
MR. LIEBMAN:

What was that?

That ruling was that the statute

-- and it says statute repeatedly -- the statute on its
face was not unconstitutional, and it cites Gregg.

That's

exactly the ruling this Court made in Gregg, which was
that the reason the statute isn't unconstitutional on its
face is it is, as the Ninth Circuit said, capable of
constitutional definition and application.
The question it set aside was are we going to
throw out the Arizona statute lock, stock and barrel?

And

it said no, we're going to see if in the definition of
that statute and in the application of that statute it was
rendered constitutional before we're going to throw the
whole thing out.

And it concluded that it was not

constitutional.
The state has said that that narrowing
requirement is met.

In fact, the state began its argument

by saying once the state has adopted a proper narrowing
construction -- that's the critical premise -- then you go
on to its second question.
Well, we are challenging that premise, and the
reason we challenge that premise is that the state has
never told us what the narrowing principle is.

There is

no statement of that in the state's briefs and the state
did not make that statement during the course of its

1

argument.
We don't know what that narrowing principle is,

2

3

and it's the absence of that principle that renders the

4

Arizona definition as applied in this case

5

unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

6

And it seems to me -If -- if the Supreme Court of Arizona

7

had in effect said exactly what the Ninth Circuit said, I

here was to extract a standard.

again what we're doing in this case is trying to extract a

2

standard and then looking at the constitutionality of that

standard.

4

If Arizona had done the same thing, said, well,

5

here's our standard, we decide that it's constitutional or

we decide that it's unconstitutional, this Court could

in the case and would be available for review here.

QUESTION:

I

Well, I'll look at the case again.

11

— I had thought that the Ninth Circuit accepted the

12

statute as setting forth a proper standard and accepted

13

the cases as setting forth the proper standard but said

14

that they -- that they can't be applied here.

15

MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that's

16

not a fair reading of the decision of the Ninth Circuit

17

and I would like to take the Court through that --

QUESTION:

MR. LIEBMAN:

important point.

I think this -- the passage that we're

the statutory language is broad, as any murder could be

cruel, heinous or depraved, the Arizona Supreme Court need

not construe the statute open-endedly.

MR. LIEBMAN:

Why did Chaney say that?
There, we rejected a similar

It's on page 24 of the

But we're not

Well, yes, but on A-25 it says that

Then it goes on to give in the

next sentence — I think it's important, Your Honor,

because in the next sentence they do say the holding of

Chaney -- the holding of Chaney is that the application in

that case was constitutional.
And then you go on to what I think is the

Well, I want you to get there, but

interpret that as saying we imposed a sentence on Chaney

under a statute that was not constitutional?

18

MR. LIEBMAN:

No.

What I interpret the -- the

same thing with regard to the -- the definition that

You're -- you're attributing an

extraordinarily Jesuitical approach to Judge Canby, I

think.

5

MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, no, Your Honor, and there's

6

a very good reason why I don't think I am doing that.

7

that is that the Ninth Circuit in Adamson, which was

decided several months after this case -- at the end of

the discussion of heinous and depraved there said, in

And

10

order to find in Adamson that the definition in Arizona is

unconstitutional of heinous and depraved, do we have to

overrule any cases that this court has already decided?

13

And the answer it gave was no.

At page 1038 of

14

the Adamson decision they said there is no prior case in

15

the Ninth Circuit that finds the definition to be

16

constitutional.

It then goes on to look at the Chaney case.

the Adamson decision also

panel case, Judge Pregerson.

4

-- if the state's reading is correct, that the Ninth

Circuit decided that the definition was constitutional, it

would require this Court to believe that Judge Pregerson

decided that in this case and a few months later signed on

to another decision in which he said that there was no

states that while Chaney establishes that the Arizona

goes on to do that in the rest of the decision.

2

If I could just give you another explanation

3

here of why I think this has to be the proper reading.

you look at page 36 of this same opinion that we're

reading, the court goes on to say it looks at the varied

Gretzler standard.

If

That is, the Arizona definition of

The Gretzler standard is that you've got to have
a case that convinces the sentencer that based on the

10

totality of the circumstances there's something about that

11

case that -- quote -- sets the case apart from the norm,

12

that makes it unusually especially heinous of depraved.

13

That's the Arizona definition.

1

reasons that I want to stress to the Court why this issue

2

is here in this Court.
The first issue is it is included within the

3
4

question presented.

Now, the question presented is

5

whether a Federal court may set aside a state court's

6

finding of an aggravating circumstance in a capital case

7

without applying a standard that requires some deference

8

to the state court's finding.
The answer to that question is if the

9
10

aggravating circumstance, as applied in the case -- as

11

defined and applied in the case, is constitutional, you do

12

defer.

13

But if it is not constitutional, you don't defer.
QUESTION:

If you -- are you talking about a

14

case-by-case analysis of each case to see whether the

15

aggravating circumstance was -- quote — constitutional or

16

not?

MR. LIEBMAN:

No.

Your Honor, I'm not talking

18

about that at all.

go about assessing that question is laid out very clearly

20

in Godfrey and Maynard, and that's exactly what I want to

21

turn to now, to go through the Godfrey/Maynard analysis as

22

applied to this case and show why it requires the result

23

-- the judgment that was granted below.

24
25

I think that the process by which you

Godfrey and Maynard proceed according to a fourstep process.

That process indicates that the heinous and

depraved interpretation by the Arizona courts and

The first step says you look at the words of the

statute and you see if the words of the statute are

circumstances.

So you've got to go to the next

Was the problem with those words cured at the

17

there's no argument here that it was cured at the trial

level for two reasons.

19

If it was cured at the trial court
But

First of all, all the trial judge did here was

20

to recite the words of the statute, heinous and depraved.

21

Those words don't suffice on their own.

22

Secondly, the only instructions that we can

23

assume that the trial court used in this case were the

24

instructions given to it by the Arizona Supreme Court in

25

prior decisions.

1

that existed as of 1980 in Arizona as to what heinous and

2

depraved meant was that the dictionary synonyms were used.

3

That was the only definition existing at the time.

4

Those dictionary synonyms are that heinous is

5

defined as grossly bad or shocking evil, and depraved is

6

defined as marked by deterioration.

7

We know that those synonyms as a substitute do

8

not constitutionally suffice because this Court held that

9

they don't in Maynard because those same dictionary

10

synonyms from Webster's Third International were read to

11

the jury in the Maynard case at the trial level.

trial definition is precisely the same in both cases and

it's constitutionally insufficient.

factors in those cases.

3

But that's not this case, Your Honor, for a

4

couple of reasons.

5

take the Arizona Supreme Court at its word here, and its

6

word is that it followed the Gretzler standard and it

7

didn't rely on any one or two factors that are set.

8

looked to see whether in its subjective judgment the facts

9

of the case as a whole set it apart from the norm.

10

First of all, we obviously have to

It

The second thing- is the only two factors that

11

one could point to are these words "relish" and

12

"gratuitous violence."

13

content than the words "heinous" and "depraved," and,

14

therefore, even if you could have a case where there were

15

just two factors and those factors would be enough, it

16

couldn't be where those factors are equally as

17

unconstitutional as heinous and depraved.

Those words don't have any more

18

The second and final point that I want to make

19

here is really the point that Justice White suggested in

20

his question, and that is that if you have a standard that

21

uses a definitional strategy that says we're going to

22

define, looking at this totality of the circumstances, a

23

qualifying case — a heinous and depraved case -- as one

24

in which we look at it all and we say it's especially bad,

25

this Court said quite clearly in Maynard that that kind of

1

an approach is unconstitutional.

2

The Court actually said -- it explicitly ruled

3

in Maynard that the requirement that the crime be — quote

4

-- more than just heinous, does not satisfy the Eighth

5

Amendment because it does not in the words of Maynard

6

inform sentencers of what they must find to impose the

7

death penalty.

9

If I might, it seems to me what the standard in
Maynard is — is that you can't just have an adjective and

an adverb.

12

And that what --

Especially what?

Well, then you find another adjective

than heinous to modify by that adverb or —

MR. LIEBMAN:

the content that this Court required in Furman to make it

3

That was the problem that this Court found in

Maynard, that indeed in Oklahoma they had said, we are

going to look at the manner of the killing and we're going

to look at the attitude of the killer and we're going to

9

you need to say what it is, what that factor is, or what

And this Court said you can't do that,

10

those factors are that make it bad and that have that

Just to answer one of the questions that the --

14

was raised in the first argument here.

15

did not conduct proportionality review in this case, and I

16

don't think that proportionality review would be

17

appropriate in a constitutional review of an aggravating

18

circumstance.

19

The Ninth Circuit

It was very clear about why it looked at those

20

cases, and it looked at cases -- and it's more than six --

21

it quoted about 12 cases because it also looked at the

22

ones that are discussed in Gretzler.

it looked at those cases.

And that's why

3

However, when it looked at those cases, it said,

you cannot extract a definition from those cases that both

saves the constitutionality of the standard by providing a

principal means to separate death from life cases and that

applies to this case.

8

you could extract.

9

There's simply no definition that

So, it's not proportionality review at all.

10

is simply a look to the cases to see if you can save an

11

otherwise unconstitutional statute and definition by

12

looking to the cases and finding in the application, as

13

reflected in those cases, a definition that would be

14

constitutional and would save the application.

15

It

But because the Court found that the line had

16

not, as it put, been made clear — that line between a

17

special and usual depravity, as it said — since that line

18

hadn't been made clear in Mr. Jeffers' case and you

19

couldn't find a line that applied from the other cases,

20

you had to find that as applied in this case it was

21

unconstitutional.

22

It seems to me then, in conclusion, that this

23

case is controlled by both Godfrey and Maynard's use of

24

Godfrey in that case.

It is open-ended

and there is no common sense core of meaning to it.

3

For those reasons, Mr. Jeffers -- the judgment

of the court below should be affirmed, that Mr. Jeffers'

of that circumstance has been given in the definition, and

either one of those sufficient?

MR. GRANT:

14

QUESTION:

I think yes.

I think --

Does that mean — we had a case that

15

I was thinking about during the argument in which the

16

murderer was upset about what the victim had done to his

17

sister and he participated in a brutal killing and there

18

was -- when the killing took place, he in effect said, you

19

got what you deserved.

20

Was a — is a revenge killing always a relish factor?

21

MR. GRANT:

Would that satisfy the standard?

I don't think it is always, but I

22

think what you have here went beyond a simple statement of

23

you got what you deserved.

24
25

QUESTION:

What -- what revenge killings would

and what would not comply with the relish factor?

MR. GRANT:

1

I would think a situation where the

defendant after injecting his victim with heroin, an

3

overdose of heroin, and finding that that wasn't

4

sufficient to kill her, after he makes statements to

5

another person in the room that he's given her enough

6

heroin to kill a horse and that the bitch won't die, where

7

he then climbs on top of the victim, who is unconscious

8

lying on a bed -QUESTION:

10

And is that climbing on top to finish

the job off -- is that the gratuitous violence where he --

QUESTION:

17

MR. GRANT:

That's getting to it.
-- thought it was -That's getting to it.
What?
We're not there yet.
What is the gratuitous violence?
The gratuitous violence -- he then,

18

after climbing on top of her, choked her with a belt.

19

When that wasn't sufficient, he choked her with his hands.

20

He then -QUESTION:

21

what I'm trying to figure.

MR. GRANT:

QUESTION:

25

When does it become gratuitous is

At that stage.
Is it when it's no longer necessary

to kill?

1

At that stage he eventually he -- I

believe at that point the evidence shows that Ms. Chaney

was dead.

inject her with additional heroin and he photographed her

while doing so.

He then forced Doris Van Der Veer, who was also

He then got back up on top of --

QUESTION:

When she did that was the victim

already dead?
MR. GRANT:

Yes.

He then got back on top of Ms.

10

Chaney himself and began striking her in the face, which

11

caused bleeding, according to the evidence.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

I thought the lower court said that

what happened after she died didn't count.
MR. GRANT:

The lower court only stated that

15

with respect to Ms. Jeffers' conduct'in disposing of the

16

body three days later.

17

to the -- to the conduct that he engaged in right at the

18

time and immediately after death.

19

It did not state that with respect

And what he did, as he was striking her in the

20

face, was to state,

21

number of names --

"this one is for", and he named a

QUESTION:

23

MR. GRANT:

Yeah.
-- of people who he felt that Ms.

24

Chaney had informed on.

25

clearly falls within those first two Gretzler definitions,

I think that sort of conduct

1

which I submit would be the core of the Gretzler

2

definitions.

3

Respondent's basic position with respect to the

4

Adamson-type issue is that the only definition that can be

5

upheld is that which allows for no discretion.

6

think this Court has ever stated that.

7

Pulley it's plainly stated that in state capital

8

sentencing procedures there will be some anomalies.

9

so long as the discretion is limited to a constitutional

10

I don't

And in -- in

But

extent, the sentencing scheme will survive.

11

Additionally, Mr. Liebman referred -- again,

12

getting back to that type of Gretzler definition -- he

13

attempted to tie it to a finding of torture and in effect

14

stated that if — if we could tie it to that, that would

15

be sufficient.

16

that type of argument in Maynard.

17

I think this Court rejected specifically

This Court stated in Maynard that we are not

18

stating that merely because -- merely tying it to such a

19

finding as torture would be the only constitutionally

20

sufficient way in which it could be defined.

21

Thank you, Your Honors.
