ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Very

MR. FISCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves two issues of constitutional

12

dimension concerning two aspects of California's 1978

13

death penalty initiative, which have since been corrected

14

in measures adopted by the committee that controls the

15

giving of instructions in state trial courts throughout

16

California in 4.983 and 1985, respectively, following

17

decisions by the California Supreme Court disapproving of

18

those instructions.

19

Petitioner Richard Boyde was found guilty by a

20

Riverside Superior Court jury of murder with two special

21

circumstance allegations being found true.

22

prosecutor had announced his intention to seek the death

23

penalty before trial commenced and the jury was examined

24

and death qualified, the trial proceeded into a penalty

25

phase that, before the same jurors, that was directed and

case.

The prosecutor presented evidence in aggravation

that covered and tracked factors A, B and C of the eleven

5

factors listed in Penal Code Section 190.3, and set forth

in the jury instruction that is before the Court in this

7

case, concerning both the crime itself, prior felony

8

convictions on the part of the Defendant, and past

9

activity of a — criminal activity of a forcible or

10

violent nature.

11

the California Supreme Court subsequently determined had

12

been improperly presented, because it did not relate to

13

the statutory aggravating factors.

The defense then began its case, and presented

15

testimony from Richard Boyde's mother, from two of his

16

sisters, his stepfather, his wife, Brenda Dickson Green,

his former girlfriend and mother of his child, and Mrs.

Dickson, Mrs. Green's mother.

19

wide variety of evidence about the character and

20

background of Richard Boyde that was not immediately

21

related to the circumstances of the underlying crime, but

22

did provide a basis for the jury, in Justice Powell's

23

words in McCleskey versus Kemp, to decline to impose the

24

death penalty.

its comparison and similarity to cases previously before

2

this Court, beginning with Lockett and Evans, and Eddings,

3

and that, and the — in showing that this defendant did

4

not deserve to be sentenced to death, a point, indeed,

5

that has not been questioned in Respondent's submission to

6

this Court.

7

That evidence consisted of the following aspects.

8

First, his impoverished childhood and difficult

9

upbringing, including the fact that he had been fatherless

10

and was obsessed with that fact, and obsessed with his

11

father's abandonment.

12

recognized in Hitchcock versus Dugger, as being

13

appropriate evidence to bring before the jury on the

14

question of whether the defendant deserved the death

15

penalty.

16

his psychological difficulties that affected his

17

performance at school, and which the family attempted

18

unsuccessfully to obtain counseling assistance for, but

19

was unable to do so..

20

recognized in Mills versus Maryland's footnote 1, and is

21

similar to other cases as well. -

This is evidence very close to that

demonstrate positive character traits that might mitigate

against the death penalty.

Fourth, his sisters' testimony that he liked

dancing, that he wanted to pursue it as a career, but that

his stepfather, being a stern gentleman, trying to do his

best, but frowned on it and discouraged young Richard from

pursuing it.

Green's testimony that when Richard was incarcerated that

he won a prize for his dance choreography while he was in

And that testimony was followed by Mrs.

10

custody.

As in Skipper versus South Carolina, this

11

certainly is a showing that the defendant could lead a

12

useful life, at least behind bars.

13

futile attempts to find employment after his release,

14

attempts that he conducted in earnest, but was

15

unsuccessful because of his record.

And finally, his

Although these factors are basic to the concern of

17

individualized sentencing, which this Court explicated in

18

Woodings versus North Carolina, many subsequent cases,

19

Petitioner's jury could not give effect to them, because

20

this evidence was nowhere on the list of eleven factors

21

set forth in Penal Code Section 190.3, and guided by the

22

jury instructions which the jury was directed to consider

23

and give effect to as the basis for its determination of

24

whether the defendant should receive death or life

imprisonment without parole.

QUESTION:

factor (k) instruction?

3

You're referring now to the so-called

MR. FISCHER:

The factor (k) instruction, the

4

instruction which directed the jury to crime related

5

circumstances that extenuated the gravity of the crime,

6

such as the seriousness —

QUESTION:

8

consider that.

9

or excuse.

10
11
12

Well, I don't see why the jury couldn't
I mean, extenuate typically means lessen

Why wouldn't that evidence be thought by the

jury to lessen or excuse the gravity of the crime?
MR. FISCHER:

Well, there are a number of reasons

why it wouldn't, beginning --

13

QUESTION:

Give me some of them.

14

MR. FISCHER:

Surely.

Beginning with the language

15

of the statute itself, which has eleven factors, all but

16

two of which are crime specific.

17

time that it was listening to the, as an aggravating

18

factor B, the prior felony convictions or the C, the prior

19

criminal activity, very clearly prior or other activity,

20

was then being told in all the remaining factors, except,

21

even including age, by the way, at the time of the crime,

22

at the time of commission of the offense, at the time of

23

the homicidal act.

24
25

So the jury, at the same

A jury, given this language, at least explicitly,
would, might well conclude, and certainly its members,

1

just from the language alone, without anything further,

2

that it, that related to the crime meant extenuating the

3

gravity of the crime, and not extenuating the reasons why

4

the defendant should not die.

5

And in fact you will notice that the CALJIC

6

committee, the California judges and distinguished

7

attorneys who create the instructions and followed this

8

up, as we have set forth in the appendix and also appears

9

in our amicus brief, use language very different to

10

portray — in effect saying any other reason that would

11

favorably bear on the decision.

12

QUESTION:

This was the change they made?

13

MR. FISCHER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, in 1983.

Well, of course, the fact that the

15

instruction might have been improved upon, may have been

16

more precise, surely isn't controlling.

17

was this likely to prevent the jury from considering the

18

sort of evidence you mention.

19

am not persuaded — I speak only for myself — by what you

20

have said so far.

21

MR. FISCHER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FISCHER:

The question is

And I must say I don't, I

I understand.

It says and any other circumstance.
Well, there are definitely other

24

circumstances, and I think the most telling aspect of this

25

case is what we find in the record, taken from the

prosecutor's argument.

2

as recently as last term's decision in Penry versus

3

Lynaugh — that it is appropriate to look at the arguments

4

of the prosecutor in determining whether the jury may have

5

been mislead by the instructions.

MR. FISCHER:

We'll resume there at one o'clock.
Very well.

Mr. Fischer, you may continue.
Thank you.

In discussing the

15

question of the factor (k)'s effect on the jury, I have

16

already mentioned the specific language of limitation of

17

the factor and its context in comparison with others on

18

the list.. Justice Rehnquist has raised the question,

19

however, of whether the jury might have been expected to

20

understand that, notwithstanding those factors, that

21

circumstances extenuating the gravity of the crime might

22

also reach beyond the crime to character and background.

23

And my answer is most tellingly, I think, taken from the

24

prosecutor's argument on those issues, on that issue.

25

The district attorney started out in his opening

argument to the jury with a list on the board, and it must

2

have been a very graphic.

3

the factors numbered, he pointed them out to the jury, he

4

had the jury read the list on the board, and then, from

5

that, he went down them one by one, individually reading

6

them and counting up whether they were aggravating or

7

mitigating.

8

beginning argument, by saying ten solid factors in

9

aggravation.

He went up to the list, he had

aspect of the instruction, which told the jury that in

15

making their determination they have taken an oath to

16

follow the law, and asked them to go through each and

every one of those factors and be guided by them in making

that determination.

the prosecutor returned to the stand.

that he talked about was that, and he used the term

talked about as, that this Court has recognized as

2

mitigating factors of character and background that come,

3

are derived from the Lockett line of cases.

4

He also stated that rehabilitation is not one of

5

the factors up on that board, and is not a basis to make a

6

decision like this, in seeming contradiction to Skipper,

7

and the suggestion that one's usefulness in prison is a

8

factor for the jury to consider.

9

is always the concern of losing someone of value.

Then he said well, there

10

don't put much stock in that argument, he said, again, it

suggested to the jury that if there was any question in

17

their mind, that they were precluded from giving effect to

this information.

So, the prosecutor's own language

Now, practitioners in California, during that time

20

and during the time before the Easley case, clarified that

21

this procedure should be abandoned, that this language was

22

too narrow, were well aware of this language, and used it

23

in their own practice.

24

counsel, and even trial judges made statements of this

25

very kind in records that are available to us.

Indeed, prosecutors, defense

And we

1

have, with the assistance of amicus curiae California

2

appellate project, some actual examples of record, a

3

significant number of them, in which this very, this very

4

thing played out.

5

Consider just as one example, on page 13 of the CAP

6

amicus brief, the reference to the case of People versus

7

Payton, where the prosecutor argued the defendant's

8

newborn Christianity, urged that there is no way that,

9

under any other circumstance which extenuates or lessens

10

the gravity of the crime, that what I am getting at you

11

have not heard during the past few days any legal evidence

12

of mitigation.

operation .at the time of the offense.

15

I passed over the language I wanted too

Let me repeat it.

Seems to refer to a fact in

It is language like that which, and obviously the

16

jury returned a death verdict in the Payton case.

17

the following pages of the CAP amicus, which graphically,

18

in real world terms, demonstrates what, in a particular

19

case, we just know from a very skilled argument of a

20

single state prosecutor.

21

evidence that was presented in this case could not be

22

considered and given effect to by the jury as a basis for

23

sentence less than death.

that that, that example is quite clearly an argument that

it simply can't be used under the gravity factor, quite

2

simply and plainly.

3

order to uphold the law, you are talking, we are talking

4

about the California statute, which you are asking us to

strike down in its entirety with respect to all cases.

That is what you want.

Yes.

You want factor (k) out.
That's right.

Must we establish that it does, it

11

cannot be misdescribed in any case, or that it does not

12

lend itself to misdescription in any case?

13

MR. FISCHER:

Well, I think that the constitutional

14

test — and when I say that we want it out, in agreeing

15

with you, I really would quality that by saying that we

16

are comfortable, certainly, representing this Petitioner,

17

and comfortable with the notion that the CALJIC

18

modification in the instruction which is given throughout

19

the state, very satisfactorily resolves that particular

20

dilemma.

21

that the practice will, or in all cases after Easley

22

indeed, will have not been subject to constitutional

23

problems.

So that we don't need to do any more than say

Let's take every case before that.

to me that if we can ascertain from empirical data like

2

this that a reasonable juror would have been mislead into

believing that he or she was precluded from giving weight,

mitigating effect, to this language —

MR. FISCHER:

QUESTION:

In the particular case.

Right.

But that doesn't mean that

8

simply because you are using a factor (k) instruction it

9

is going to be always bad.

In which case, calling

10

attention to this other case, does not do your particular

11

case any good.

12

MR. FISCHER:

Well, for one thing, it does our

13

case, hopefully, some good, because I believe it

14

supplants, it reinforces, excuse me, reinforces the point

15

we have made in our case.

of this case, because the court also charged the jury

not allow the sentencers reasoned moral judgment about the

5

In Sumner versus Shuman, for example, this Court

concluded that, even though the defendant had committed

murder while already serving life imprisonment for murder,

8

that nevertheless it was necessary to, under the Eighth

Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, to assure reliability

the death penalty, both apart from the mitigating

removed from that.
MR. FISCHER:

18

Well, I think there is a critical

19

difference in this case.

And I think the critical

20

difference is that the jury is told that if they determine

21

that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating

circumstances, and parenthetically, nothing is said to

them .about appropriateness whatsoever, that, based on the

MR. FISCHER:

With reference to the mitigating

factors, it is instructed that it can and should consider

to any one of the factors, and that any one mitigating

factor can outweigh all aggravating factors.

MR. FISCHER:

understood your question fully.

As long as the jury is

instructed to take into account Justice Stevens' views as

to the problem of aggravating circumstances outweighing

mitigating, both in terms of on their own and in

verdict that death is not the appropriate penalty, that is

all that is constitutionally required.

that even though aggravating circumstances outweigh

10

position, and then I would like to briefly clarify our

11

position with regard to the facial validity of both of the

12

instructions at issue in this case.

13

In the Petitioner's view, he had a jury which was

14

foreclosed at every turn from exercising any discretion or

15

moral judgment as to the appropriate penalty in this case.

16

He argues that the jury was precluded as a matter of law

17

by factor (k) from considering any of his four days of

18

evidence in mitigation, almost 450 pages of transcript,

19

over two volumes of transcript.

20

jury was further foreclosed by the word "shall" from

21

considering the alternative penalty of life without

22

parole, life without possibility of parole, and was

23

mandated by the word "shall."

No.

We, our position is that

5

reasonable jurors would understand that means, that word

"shall" to mean that after they had exercised their

7

discretion and moral judgment in the application of the

8

weighing process, then, and only then, would they be

required to return a penalty which was appropriate and

application of the weighing process.

constitutional issue in this case, Your Honor, as to

could be better worded.

And in

attack under -Lockett, and further noted in footnote 28 of

2

Ramos, referred not just to the statutory language, but to

3

the specific instruction that was given in this case, the

4

factor (k) instruction, as well as the instruction to

5

consider all the other evidence in the case.

6

And the Court referred to that in the context of

7

saying, in Ramos, that the Briggs instruction, the

8

commutation instruction, did not really divert the jury's

9

focus from the central purpose^-of the sentencing scheme.

10

This was merely an appendage.

11

effect of the Briggs instruction, the Court looked

12

specifically, in footnote 28, to the instruction to

13

consider all the evidence, and in particular to the

14

unadorned factor (k) instruction, which was given in that

In California versus Brown,

for example, I don't think the issue before this Court was
whether the so-called anti-sympathy or mere sympathy
instruction was worded as well as it might possibly be
worded.

The issue was whether it was constitutionally

adequate —
QUESTION:

But it is important when a man's life is

in danger, isn't it?
MR. MILLAR:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, Your Honor, I missed that.
I say it is important when a man's life

is at issue, isn't it?
MR. MILLAR:

I think it's important, and the test

that this Court has applied in California versus Brown is
what reasonable jurors would do.

With respect to factor

(k) it is our position that reasonable jurors would
understand that the words any other circumstances which
extenuate mean just that, any other circumstances which
extenuate, or mitigate, or lessen the penalty, the
culpability of the defendant.
And I think, referring to Justice O'Connor's
concurring opinion in California versus Brown, I think it
is interesting that she noted there that the reason why we
allow jurors to consider such things as deprived
childhoods and* things like that is because of society's
collective belief that these things mitigate culpability.

circumstances of the crime, directly related to the crime,
they can already be considered by the jury under factor

first of all, we don't believe that that is a valid,

that —well, first of all, the California Supreme Court,

MR. MILLAR:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

I would point out

that the jury was specifically told twice during the

10

instructions by the court to consider all the evidence in

11

the case.

12

The prosecutor did not ignore the evidence under f-actor

13'

(k).

14

rather that he had a different view of what the defendant

15

was like than the defense counsel was arguing.

16

was that we have here a man who lies, who deceives, who

17

would make up a fictitious big Mike, who would even blame

18

his cousin for the commission of this terrible crime, who

19

was a violent individual.

20

person we have.

21

The prosecutor emphasized that to the jury.

In fact, his argument with respect to factor (k) was

He said that is the kind of

And then he turned to the evidence in mitigation,

22

and he said that that evidence simply did not mitigate

factors, which the jury was entitled to consider under the

instructions.

What he said was, we are all

I am not saying you can't

of this case, in the context of the gravity of this crime.

6

How much does it count. . He suggested first that it

7

counted not at all, and then he suggested later in, I

8

believe it was his rebuttal argument, that even if the

9

jury disagreed with him and was inclined to give it some

10

weight, they still needed to ask themselves the ultimate

11

question, which was does it outweigh the other

12

circumstances, which he argued were all in aggravation.

13

He did not

I would like to turn my attention at this point to

14

the second issue, the "shall" issue.

15

before, it is our position that this instruction, like the

16

factor (k) instruction, is valid on its face.

17

position that this Court should not even have to look at

18

the arguments of counsel to reach that determination, but

19

that if the Court wants to, to satisfy itself as the

20

California Supreme Court did, we don't believe that that

is constitutionally prohibited.

is it your position that the outweigh "shall" instruction
