ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY IVAN PASEK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PASEK:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Federal courts

12

have exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under

13

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.

14

The proceedings here began with a complaint

15

filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County under the

16

Illinois Human Rights Act.

17

made to exhaust administrative remedies under Illinois

18

law, Yellow Freight filed a motion to dismiss that

19

complaint for lack of jurisdiction and the plaintiff

20

sought leave to amend.

21

Because there was no attempt

An agreed order was entered under which the

22

state law complaint was dismissed with prejudice and the

23

motion for leave to amend was continued.

24

Yellow Freight filed a removal petition and the Federal

25

district court eventually granted leave to amend.

Five days later

Yellow

1

Freight filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that any filing

2

by Colleen Donnelly was ineffective because Federal courts

3

have exclusive jurisdiction over Title VII claims.
The parties have agreed in this case that the

4
5

law governing this was set forth by the Court in Gulf

6

Offshore and recently reapplied by the Court in its Taflin

7

decision, that the presumption in favor of concurrent

8

jurisdiction is a rebuttable one and that it may be

9

rebutted either explicitly or implicitly, explicitly by

10

statutory directive, which is not present in this case, or

11

from the unmistakable implication from legislative

12

history, or by demonstration of a clear incompatibility

13

between state court jurisdiction and the Federal interest.

14

We submit that the touchstone for this inquiry

15

is congressional intent and that the Court must examine

16

facts such as the language structure and legislative

17

history of the act in order to determine whether Congress

18

intended to confer exclusive jurisdiction on Federal

19

courts.

20

When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was adopted,

21

it was against a background of debate over state's rights,

22

and the compromise model which Congress eventually settled

23

on initiated with a model patterned after the National

24

Labor Relations Act which had cease and desist powers and

25

which would have provided for appeals to the circuit

1

courts of appeals and no resort at all to the trial courts

2

of general jurisdiction.
Under such a model, consistent with this Court's

3
4

decision in the Garner case, there would have been

5

exclusive Federal jurisdiction over those claims.

6

it is not surprising that when the promoters of the bill

7

accepted a compromise of private suits for Title VII

8

violations, they presumed that those suits would be

9

brought in the Federal district court.

10

Thus,

There is thus no reference in the legislative

11

history that the new rights which were being created would

12

be enforceable in the state courts, and it was the common

13

understanding that the enforcement was to be in the

14

Federal courts.

15

Representative McCollouch, for example, who was

16

the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, noted

17

that there were several members of the committee who

18

preferred that the ultimate determination of

19

discrimination rests with the Federal judiciary.

1

MR. PASEK:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— it depends on how you read that

3

phrase.

I mean, you could say that the ultimate

4

determination should rest with the Federal judiciary or

5

should rest with the Federal judiciary as opposed to the

6

administrative agency that was -MR. PASEK:

7

But in either case, it's the Federal

8

authorities who will be making the decision under the

9

statute.
QUESTION:

10

Yeah, but — but the way you read it,

11

it was as though it was in the context of a discussion of

12

whether there would be enforcement in the states or in the

13

Federal courts.

14

the statement was made?

Is that the context in which — in which

MR. PASEK:

15

The statement was not made in that

16

context.

17

whether there would be administrative cease and desist.

18

The statement was made against the context of

QUESTION:

That's right.

And what he said is -

19

- is we think the ultimate determination should be made by

20

the Federal judiciary, not by the administrative agency.

21

So it really doesn't say much about —

22

MR. PASEK:

Well, the — it is consistent with a

23

whole series of other comments made by the supporters of

24

the legislation, the court model, that consistently used

25

reference to the Federal courts.

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Pasek, it's true that the

2

legislative history contains many references to the

3

supposed Federal court jurisdiction, but does it contain

4

anywhere a discussion of the possible role of state

5

courts?
MR. PASEK:

6

7

about any role for the state courts.
QUESTION:

8

9

There is no discussion whatsoever

So it's a little hard to say that it

meets the Gulfshore — Gulf Offshore requirement that

10

there be an unmistakable implication of Federal

11

jurisdiction exclusively.
MR. PASEK:

12

I believe, Your Honor, that when the

13

Congress talks about, as Senator Cotton said, that the

14

process will lead to one place, the door of the Federal

15

court, he was by implication excluding the door of the

16

state court from resolving those cases.

17

QUESTION:

Well, but the thrust of Gulf

18

Offshore's comments was that it has to be an unmistakable

19

implication, and it looks to me like that's hard to make

20

out here.

21

court involvement but just nothing to say unmistakably

22

that state court jurisdiction is precluded.

23

True, there's lots of discussion of Federal

MR. PASEK:

In this case there was explicit

24

consideration of the role of the states in dealing with

25

employment discrimination claims.

And as Congress was

1

clear to point out, the state role was limited to state

2

enforcement of state law under the deferral process

3

established in Section 706(c).
It would be inconsistent with the deferral

4
5

process Congress established if you were to say that the

6

plaintiff would be required to pursue remedies under state

7

or local law for 60 days, then that process is to be

8

shifted over to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity

9

Commission for at least 180 days, following which the

10

aggrieved individual could then file suit presumably in

11

the state court, if that were the case.

12

reason to prohibit the state officials initially from

13

hearing the Federal claim if Congress intended that these

14

claims could be brought in the state court in the first

15

instance.

16

There would be no

There was in the 1972 legislative history,

17

again, repeated discussion about the role of the Federal

18

courts in language which we submit leaves it unmistakable

19

that Congress presumed that the Federal courts would have

20

exclusive jurisdiction.

21

In the House, Representative Erlenborn offered

22

the amendment for a court enforcement model, and in

23

distinguishing between the procedures that would apply in

24

the administrative context versus the court enforcement

25

model, he said that the rules of evidence, the rules of

1

civil procedure that apply in the courts, the Federal

2

district courts, as "my bill would require any case to be

3

tried there, those general rules of evidence do not

4

necessarily apply in administrative hearings."

5

Had Congress intended that any courts could have

6

heard those cases, there would have been no reason for him

7

to state that his bill would require the cases to be heard

8

in Federal district courts as opposed to simply courts.

9

QUESTION:

But I — I think we've had cases,

10

haven't we, Mr. Pasek, where the congressional enactment

11

will talk about authorizing a suit in the United States

12

district court and we've said that that is not

13

sufficiently negativing the idea of state court

14

jurisdiction.

15

It seems to me where someone is talking about

16

the rules of evidence that are going to govern, they say,

17

well, sure, it's the Federal Rules of Evidence, they're

18

contemplating suits in the Federal district court.

19

under our cases, I don't think that's enough to exclude

20

state jurisdiction.

21

MR. PASEK:

But

I agree that the mere grant of

22

jurisdiction to the Federal courts is not sufficient.

23

Congress went beyond that mere grant of jurisdiction

24

through these types of pronouncements by stating, for

25

example, as Speaker Albert said characterizing

But

1

Representative Erlenborn's position, that the protection

2

of the principles of justice require that these cases be

3

heard only in the Federal courts.

4

in the courts as opposed to administrative agencies.

He could have said only

Representative McCollouch discussing the

5
6

injunction power stated that the Erlenborn substitute

7

would allow only as Federal court to issue such an

8

injunction.

9

On the Senate side, you have the same sort of

10

considerations.

When Senator Dominick repeatedly offered

11

his court enforcement amendment, he repeatedly referred to
*

12

the district courts where, under the Dominick amendment,

13

suits would have to be filed.

14

consideration of the Dominick amendment that his amendment

15

would "vest adjudicatory power where it belongs in

16

impartial judges shielded" by — shielded "from political

17

winds by life tenure."

18

court judicial system.

19

He stated on the second

That does not apply to the state

And specifically he stated that we would be

20

distributing the power to enforce this law to 93 district

21

courts with 398 district judges.

22

precise as you can expect someone to be that the intention

23

was that these cases be brought in the Federal district

24

courts.

25

I submit that's about as

You couple those legislative assertions with the

1

carefully ordered sequential procedure that I referred to

2

in response to Justice O'Connor's question and it would be

3

inconceivable to think that the sponsors of this

4

legislation who had agreed to the compromise, were

5

presuming that state courts had any role in the

6

enforcement.

7

This is reinforced by several procedural

8

mechanisms which Congress built into the statute which

9

have application only in the Federal courts.

And as this

10

Court suggests in its Taflin decision, the inclusion of

11

such provisions is a suggestion that Congress did intend

12

exclusive Federal jurisdiction.

13

Start, for example, with the provisions of

14

Section 706(j) which provide that any civil action under

15

this section shall be subject to appeal as provided in

16

Sections 1291 and 1292 of Title 28.

17

applies only to the cases that can be taken to the Federal

18

courts of appeals, and those are only cases which arise

19

out of the Federal district courts or thorough the

20

administrative agencies.

21

Now, that provision

I'm not aware of any case in which Congress has

22

specified specific reference to Sections 1291 and 1292

23

which involve concurrent jurisdiction.

24

Circuit characterized that as merely a grant of

25

jurisdiction.

1
2

statement by Congress.
And further, Sections 1291 and 1292 carry some

3

important baggage with them over what constitutes an

4

appealable order.

5

state court systems under which a number of orders which

6

would be characterized as interlocutory and not appealable

7

by this Court could be appealed directly in a state court

8

system, thereby staying proceedings and thereby

9

interfering with the congressional goal of seeking the

10
11

That might be very different under

rapid adjudication of these cases.
QUESTION:

In your view, Mr. Pasek, supposing

12

that Congress wanted to specify the appeal procedure in

13

Federal courts, what more should it have done to indicate

14

that -- if it were of the mind that state courts should

15

have jurisdiction, too?

16

MR. PASEK:

If it had not included the reference

17

to 1291 and 1292, that would be some indication that the

18

-- well, reverse that.

19

the legislative discussion, if the sequential procedure

20

were not present and if the procedural mechanisms which

21

are unique to the Federal system were not present, we

22

wouldn't be here because there would be no basis to argue

23

that the Gulf Offshore standards have been met.

24
25

If Congress had said nothing in

But by including the reference to 1291 and 1292,
we submit that that's a strong indication that Congress

1

intended these cases to be brought only in the Federal

2

courts because you would not have cases appealed from the

3

state court system to the Federal courts of appeals.

4

QUESTION:

But we've -- we've said in our cases

5

on this issue, have we not, that the granting of

6

jurisdiction to the Federal district courts is not

7

sufficient to show exclusive Federal jurisdiction.

8

MR. PASEK:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
Well, why should specifying appeal

10

from the Federal district court to the court of appeals be

11

any different than the granting of Federal jurisdiction of

12

the district courts for that purpose?

13

MR. PASEK:

It's an unusual procedure by

14

Congress to specify that the appeal is to be taken

15

pursuant to Sections 1291 and 1292.

16

few instances in which Congress has ever done that, and

17

all of those statutes are ones in which Congress has at

18

the same time set forth that the jurisdiction is to be

19

exclusively Federal.

20

I'm only aware of a

For example, you have that in the Natural Gas

21

Act, you have that in the Federal Power Act and in the

22

Connelly Hot Oil Act.

23

examples I could find in which, other than Title VII, the

24

Congress has specified the 1291 and 1292 procedure.

25

I believe those are the only

In addition, you have the Federal interest in

1

uniformity which might be compromised here because of the

2

possible litigation of these claims in the state courts.

3

Congress was clear to spell out that the injunctive relief

4

would be issued pursuant to Rule 65.

5

with it specified procedures which protect the interests

6

of the respondents as well as the persons claiming to be

7

aggrieved and there may not be an analog in the state

8

court system for the grant of injunctive relief.

9

Rule 65 contains

Therefore, you could have a system under which

10

restraining orders would be granted or denied and the

11

result would depend not on the case but simply upon which

12

the court the — the action had been brought.

13

There is no basis in the legislative history

14

whatsoever to suggest that Congress was attempting to

15

regulate the procedures of the state courts when it

16

included these provisions in the statute.

17

Similarly, there are provisions of the statute

18

dealing with the time table of the cases, the assignment

19

to individual judges, the expedition of proceedings, the

20

use of magistrates pursuant to Rule 53, under which

21

Congress carefully prescribed certain procedures to apply.

22

Now, those procedures were part of the

23

compromise that Congress settled on.

A number of those

24

procedures came in with the final consideration of the

25

Dominick amendment where Senator Dominick stated,
14

"Despite

1

voluminous rhetoric to the contrary, my convictions that

2

U.S. District Court enforcement provides employees and

3

potential employees with the fairest, most effective

4

redress of their grievances remains unshaken."

5

The biggest argument against court enforcement

6

at the time was the delay, and Senator Dominick sought to

7

remedy that and to assuage the opponents of the court

8

enforcement system by incorporating the procedural

9

provisions, such as assigning the case to an individual

10

district court judge for an expedited hearing.
Now, the compromise between the proponents of

11

12

the court enforcement and the cease and desist models is

13

an essential part of this legislation.

14

Seventh Circuit did, that these provisions simply do not

15

apply if the case is brought in a state court, then you in

16

effect remove the compromises that Congress specifically

17

built into the statute.

If you say, as the

1

Because of the -- the test or the principle

2

announced in Gulf — Gulf Offshore and recently, five

3

weeks ago, in Taflin, namely that three-prong approach,

4

does the statute itself express that state court shall not

5

have jurisdiction, which we don't have here, and then,

6

secondly, a look at legislative intent and, thirdly, a

7

look at the nature of the Federal law and whether or not

8

it's incompatible with being heard by the state courts, I

9

have to address what counsel for Yellow Freight calls the

10

touchstone of their argument, namely that there is

11

legislative intent here from the congressional debates

12

that the sovereign power of state courts to hear Federal

13

cases, which is rooted in our Federal system, is removed

14

by an examination of intent from what certain senators or

15

congressmen said or didn't say in a bill such as Title

16

VII, which, frankly, was — it was amended 87 times in 83

17

days.

18

but I must face it head-on.

19

Later on I have some problem with that analysis,

If there was any mention in the legislative

20

history of state courts — and there are none, it's all —

21

it's always Federal courts, Federal judiciary — my

22

position would be more difficult because it would at least

23

evince some debate on the issue that we are here on,

24

whether or not we intend, Congress, by enacting Title VII

25

to oust or divest the state courts from hearing these

claims.

would have to be some express mention of state courts, do

MR. HENELY:

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.
Oh, most certainly.
You do?

Well, what if the

10

legislative history — assuming legislative history could

11

get the job done in the first place, what if the

12

legislative -- it was clear that everybody said, these

13

suits may only be brought — may be brought only in the

14

Federal courts?

15

MR. HENELY:

Oh, that's -- that's another way of

16

putting it.

17

certainly throughout the Federal courts in deciding this

18

issue, as to whether that's enough, but -- and that's one

19

of the problems of looking at it.

20

Reasonable men may differ, as they have

QUESTION:

Well, I take it the argument on the

21

other side is that the legislative history is equivalent

22

to that kind of a statement, that the legislative history

23

indicates that they really meant to have these suits

24

brought only in the Federal courts.

QUESTION:

Well, why would Congress have

provided for expedited procedures in these cases in

Federal courts and other provisions that apply

8

specifically to these claims in Federal courts if they

9

intended state court jurisdiction to be concurrent?

10

MR. HENELY:

Well, Congress certainly has the

11

power to tag on procedural provisions to any enactment.

12

There is talk in the legislative history of a Federal

13

court backlog of 19 or 20 months at the time in 1964.

think the answer is they were concerned about long delays

MR. HENELY:

It follows from that that if that were the

15

There are statements with regard to -- by

16

Senator Humphrey that this employment of Title VII here is

17

to implement and broaden rather than supplant the existing

state court laws and procedures for adjudicating

20

The language and the set-up of — of the statute

itself, with the interplay between EEOC and the

involvement of state court agencies right in the statute,

23

in my view, suggests an attempt to involve the states.

to involve the judicial power of the states as well.

is looking for in the legislative history of Title VII,

one may find support that there is an implication one way

It is suggested

whether or not there is unmistakable implication in the

One of the district courts who held concurrent

it shows just that assumption.

And given the start with the NLRB

The involvement of the states that Mr. Henely

15

talked about was specifically worked out by the reference

16

to state agencies, but it was under state law where the

states were to have any role.

position on this issue, and indeed it has, before this

exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts to hear Title VII

claims.

7

In United States v. Minnick, the Solicitor General

Finally, with respect to the issue of

8

preclusion, I'm surprised that a plaintiff would be in

9

favor of having concurrent jurisdiction because it is a

10

nearly universal rule, as Justice Kennedy noted in his

11

Eichman case on the Ninth Circuit, a nearly universal

12

principle that preclusion will apply only if the first

13

court rendering the decision had jurisdiction over the

14

second claim.

15

So that if you have concurrent jurisdiction, a

16

plaintiff could indeed be claim-precluded, having

17

litigated in the state court.

of the states in this area that the reference to the

QUESTION:

And I would submit

Well, you really have to gather

7

something out of the legislative history other than a

desire to make — to make a — the Federal courts

procedure available for the plaintiff in the Federal

courts.

You have to go on and say that — that that's the

PASEK:

That's correct.

Yes.

And where

there is that exclusive jurisdiction, then the plaintiff

will not be claim precluded.

17

The result of that case was no discrimination and — and

the Court was — was required to dismiss based upon the

at the state level the overwhelming majority of the states

— I believe all except three — have adopted statutes

which contain discrimination provisions and discrimination

remedies.
The overwhelming majority of those states

provide for jurisdiction through a cease and desist type

administrative agency similar to the National Labor

Relations Board.

their claims in state courts, there can then be a Title

So, if you say that plaintiffs can bring

10

VII claim proceeding in the state court and a parallel

11

proceeding under the state administrative law, where the

12

state administrative agency has no jurisdiction to

13

consider the Title VII claim.

14

The advantage, consistent with the congressional

15

intent of providing for exclusive jurisdiction, is that

16

the states can serve Federalism's interests by trying to

17

resolve the discrimination complaints under state law and

18

the Federal claims can be heard in Federal court where,

19

under the Dominick amendment, the claims were required to

be heard.

The general principle has always been that while
