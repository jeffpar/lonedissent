CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT LAWSON ENGLISH

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. ENGLISH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The sole question before the Court this morning

13

with respect to this case is whether false and defamatory

14

statements published about the petitioner by the

15

respondents are entitled to constitutional protection

16

under the First Amendment.

17

This Court has repeatedly stated that there is

18

no constitutional value in false statements of fact.

19

the Ohio courts below have afforded exactly that

20

protection in this case.

21

to correct that error and to delineate finally how the

22

opinion/fact distinction should be made in the context of

23

defamation law.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yet

This Court has the opportunity

Mr. English, do you think that this

case involves a matter of public concern?

1

MR. ENGLISH:

Your Honor, not a general matter

2

of public concern, but certainly a matter of public

3

concern as to the local communities involved.

4
5

QUESTION:

Does it fall under the rubric of the

Hepps case?

6

MR. ENGLISH:

Your Honor, I believe it does fall

7

under the rubric of the Hepps case, and had the Hepps case

8

been properly followed by the trial court, clearly this

9

case would have been actionable as opposed to absolutely

10

privileged.

11

QUESTION:

And if it's -- if Hepps applies, then

12

the plaintiff below would have the burden of proving

13

falsity?

14
15

MR. ENGLISH:
is absolutely the case.

16

QUESTION:

17

being proven false?

18

Without a doubt, Your Honor, that

And are these statements capable of

MR. ENGLISH:

Your Honor, these statements are

19

quite capable of being proven false.

20

four statements unequivocally that could be proven false.

21

There are actually

As the Supreme Court of Ohio in the Milkovich

22

decision in late 1984 held, the primary impact of this

23

article is to accuse the petitioner of committing the

24

crime of perjury.

25

perjury occurred was of records, stenographically

The proceeding at which the alleged

1

recorded, and clearly the testimony at that proceeding

2

could easily be compared with the statements that Mr.

3

Milkovich had made previously as to the same question.

4

And thus, a reasonable jury could determine whether or not

5

the statements in fact were false or whether they were

6

true.

7
8

QUESTION:

matter whether you label it fact or opinion, does it?

9
10

MR. ENGLISH:

Your Honor, I would agree with

you.
QUESTION:

11

12

If that's true, it doesn't much

The question is whether you can prove

that it's false.

13

MR. ENGLISH:

Clearly this Court in the Hepps

14

case has indicated, at least with reference to private

15

individuals on matters of public concern involving

16

newspapers -- which is exactly the situation that we have

17

here — that it is the Plaintiff's burden to establish

18

without resort to presumptions that a particular statement

19

is false.

20

We believe that that can be demonstrated in this

21

instance without difficulty and, therefore, the action

22

should have been allowed to proceed and unquestionably it

23

should not have been protected by the First Amendment.

24
25

QUESTION:

So -- so you would -- would accept as

a definition of opinion is something that cannot be proven

1

true or false?

2

MR. ENGLISH:

Your Honor, I would say that that

3

is a fundamental aspect of the question of opinion.

If

4

something cannot be proved true or false, I would suggest

5

to the Court that it could be properly labeled as opinion.

6

However, as Justice O'Connor has just mentioned,

7

it may not be necessary in this area of the law to even

8

adopt any kind of opinion privilege if we require a

9

defamation plaintiff to affirmatively prove falsity.
But in this case, the allegation is that Mr.

10
11

Milkovich lied under oath in a judicial proceeding.

12

is quintessentially an assertion of fact which, if false,

13

should be actionable under the state law of defamation.

14

That

However, certain statements, which are very

15

rhetorical or hyperbolic or polemical, which cannot be

16

proved true or false, could easily be characterized as

17

opinion.

18

this Court need not reach that question in this case,

19

since based on the Hepps case, Mr. Milkovich can

20

demonstrate his entitlement to at least a jury

21

determination on the question of whether or not this --

22

these statements were true or false, and unquestionably

23

they were defamatory.

However, it is the petitioner's judgement that

24

You Honors, as I have pointed out in my brief,

25

there are many instances in the past twenty years, after

1

this Court's decision in Gertz v. Robert Welch, were

2

courts have presumed that there is a broad First Amendment

3

based privilege in the law of defamation.

4

that presumption, and this Court has never so held, there

5

have been many courts that have developed a series of

6

different formulations as to how that distinction should

7

be made, whether something is an assertion of fact or

8

whether something is a expression of opinion.

9

As a result of

Most courts have relied first on the question of

10

whether or not a statement is objectively verifiable.

11

as I have pointed out in this instance, this statement is

12

unequivocally objectively verifiable.

13

And

This is not a situation like, for example, the

14

case Buckley v. Littell decided by the Second Circuit

15

where there was a statement that William F. Buckley was a,

16

quote, "fellow fascist traveler."

17

Second Circuit looked at that language and said there is

18

no way that that statement can be in fact verifiable.

19

is loosely defined words.

20

political in nature.

21

not defamatory, or even if defamatory, is not actionable.

22

However, in the same case, Mr. Buckley was also

In that case, the

It

It is polemical, it is

And as a result, that statement is

23

accused to having committed plagiarism.

24

Circuit analyzed that question and said that, very much

25

like perjury or an allegation of perjury, is definitely
7

(800) FOR DEPO

And the Second

1

empirically provable, clearly is defamatory, and therefore

2

should be actionable.

3

So the Second Circuit has certainly recognized

4

that there is an opinion privilege, but that opinion

5

privilege only applies in the area where there is very

6

polemical language, hyperbolae being utilized, and where

7

in context the statement cannot be objectively verified.

8

In this case, Your Honors, the respondents have

9

contended that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide

10

this case on the grounds that the Ohio Supreme Court has

11

determined that there is an opinion privilege under the

12

Ohio constitution.

13

Long, decided by this Court in 1983, for that proposition.

14

I would like to address that question directly because I

15

think it's important in the context.

16

They cite the case of Michigan v.

The procedural history of this case is somewhat

17

unique.

It has had 15 years of litigation in Ohio's

18

courts.

There have been three attempts to bring this case

19

to the attention of the United States Supreme Court, the

20

latest and presumably only successful one, being the one

21

sought be the petitioner.

22

In Michigan v. Long this Court held that where a

23

state court has unequivocally determined an issue on

24

separate adequate and independent state grounds, this

25

Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the question.

1

However, in this case, the decision from which the appeal

2

is taken is from the Ohio Court of Appeals for the

3

Eleventh Appellate District, and not from the Ohio Supreme

4

Court.

5

the Eleventh Appellate District relies nearly exclusively

6

on Federal precedent and also relies on the decision of

7

the Ohio Supreme Court in the accompanying Scott case.

And the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals from

8

As the Court is aware, the Ohio Supreme Court in

9

-- in a period of yet -- just 15 months has determined, on

10

one hand, that the statements in question in this case are

11

constitutionally protected as opinion under the First

12

Amendment, and then 15 months later determined that the

13

very same statements under the very same facts, but with a

14

different plaintiff, are in fact constitutionally

15

protected or immunized by the First Amendment.

16

The Ohio Supreme Court did in fact mention on

17

two occasions in its — in its decision that it was

18

relying in part on the Ohio constitution.

19

fair reading of the Scott case clearly indicates that the

20

Ohio Supreme Court was primarily relying on this Court's

21

decision in Gertz against Robert Welch, decided in 1974,

22

and the veritable flood of cases that have been decided

23

since, presuming that there is this broad First Amendment-

24

based privilege.

on the Ohio cases that state law and First Amendment

2

Federal constitutional law are one and the same so far as

3

the definition of opinion?

4

MR. ENGLISH:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

number of old cases that hold that.

6

cases that hold that the --

QUESTION:

There are a

However, there are no

I mean, how -- not -- not, pre-New

York Times v. Sullivan, I assume?
MR. ENGLISH:

9

They are -- they are pre-New York

10

Times v. Sullivan, basically standing for the proposition

11

that the Ohio constitution means essentially the same

12

thing as the First Amendment with respect to freedom of

13

the press.

14

The two provisions are roughly the same,

15

although, ironically enough, the Ohio constitution

16

expressly recognizes that there shall be free speech

17

subject to the right of protection of your reputational

18

interest if you are defamed.

19

First Amendment says nothing about the state law of

20

defamation.

21

Whereas, obviously, the

The Ohio Supreme Court in this case — in the

22

Scott case, merely relied in part on the Ohio

23

constitution, saying that it was a separate source of

24

authority but quite clearly under the analysis provided in

25

Michigan v. Long, which is frankly a very analogous to

1

this one, this Court has jurisdiction to decide the

2

question.

3

There are no Ohio cases known to the petitioner

4

that specifically hold that the first — that the section

5

of the Ohio constitution, Article I, Section 11, provides

6

more protection for freedom of the press than does the

7

First Amendment to the Constitution.
QUESTION:

8

Is the -- is the only language that

9

the Ohio Supreme Court used in Long that — that justifies

10

the assertion of independent state grounds the phrase that

11

the ideals of the First Amendment are independently

12

reinforced in Section 11, Article I of the Ohio — is

13

there

14

MR. ENGLISH:

There is -- I'm -- I'm sorry, Your

15

Honor.

16

in Justice Locher's opinion for the court that says that

17

the Court is relying on the Ohio constitution as well as

18

the Federal Constitution.

19

Federal constitutional provision is very much interwoven

20

with the Ohio constitutional provision.

21

certainly Petitioner's view that this Court has

22

jurisdiction to decide the scope of, or even the

23

applicability of a First Amendment-based privilege.

24

Your Honors, if this Court adopts a First

25

That is a statement, and then there is a statement

There is no question that the

1

ask the Court to establish that privilege in a very narrow

2

manner and look to two primary objective factors, as

3

opposed to subjective factors on which the Ohio Supreme

4

Court relied in --

5

QUESTION:

Is this -- is this is -- is this your

6

primary submission, Mr. English, or is your primary

7

submission that there really is no — no need for a

8

separate First Amendment privilege for opinion?

9

MR. ENGLISH:

Your Honor, I would say that under

10

the Hepps case, after the — after the Hepps was decided

11

there is no need for a First Amendment-based privilege,

12

period.

13

However, if the Court acknowledges that a First

14

Amendment-based privilege is necessary in this area,

15

primarily because of the breathing space requirement that

16

the Court has recognized ever since New York Times v.

17

Sullivan, then that privilege should be very narrowly

18

drawn, and it should be objective factors.

19

Certainly one objective factor is whether or not

20

the statement is objectively verifiable, as Justice

21

O'Connor has pointed out, and certainly which is now a

22

requirement, constitutional requirement, based on the

23

Hepps case.

24

I would suggest --

Yeah, but Hepps -- in Hepps you still

2

before a plaintiff can undertake to prove something is

false it has to be provable, I guess.

4

MR. ENGLISH:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So -- so you really don't solve much.

6

You still have to figure out whether something is

7

verifiable.
MR. ENGLISH:

8

9

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's a fact question.

And, obviously, if something is

10

not verifiable — if the plaintiff cannot prove what the

11

statement is, the plaintiff, as I read the Hepps case,

12

cannot recover, period.

Your Honor, that -- that is the

position that I have advanced in the brief, and I believe

that that would adequately protect the competing interest

24

at stake.

there's certainly need for a vigorous robust free press.

years and has virtually every constitutional impediment

6

put in his way, and now we have the Supreme Court of Ohio

that would be a misconstruction of the article.

Diadiun has said is that everyone knows in his heart --
