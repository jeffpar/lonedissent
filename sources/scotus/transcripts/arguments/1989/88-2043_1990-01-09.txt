ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. CLAIRE GUTHRIE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MS. GUTHRIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes to you today by way of an

12

interlocutory appeal from a case pending in the Eastern

13

District of Virginia which concerns the administration of

14

the Virginia Commonwealth's Medicaid Program.

15

The case concerns, fundamentally, the

16

significance of action Congress took in 1981 when it

17

amended the Social Security Act by way of what is now

18

commonly called the Boren Amendment.

19

granted states new authority to set Medicaid payment rates

20

for in-patient hospital services.

21

The Boren Amendment

Exercising this new authority in 1982, Virginia

22

adopted a prospective payment system as its method for

23

reimbursing hospital rate -- hospitals for expenditures

24

for Medicaid patients.

25

In March of 1986, Respondent in this case, The

Virginia Hospital Association, brought suit challenging

2

our prospective payment system on the ground that it

3

violated the terms of the Boren Amendment because it

4

under-reimburses Virginia hospitals.

5

hospital association argued that our system is

6

inconsistent with Federal standards.

7

Accordingly, the

The Commonwealth moved for dismissal or summary

8

judgment on several grounds, including, among other

9

things, the Eleventh Amendment and the lack of enforceable

10

right under Section 1983 and collateral estoppel, and the

11

district court initially granted judgment on the

12

collateral estoppel grounds, but that decision was

13

ultimately reversed by the Fourth Circuit.

14

We're now before you on appeals from subsequent

15

decisions by the district court and the Fourth Circuit

16

that rejected the Commonwealth's grounds -- remaining

17

grounds for dismissal, and from a decision fundamentally

18

that -- in which the Fourth Circuit ruled that the Boren

19

Amendment guarantees cost-efficient hospitals, a

20

substantive Federal right to reasonable and adequate

21

reimbursement, and that this right can be enforced under

22

Section 1983.

issues, but the Court decided to grant and to hear only

24

this one.

1

points relevant to our principal argument, which is that

2

the Boren Amendment, as drafted, does not secure any

3

substantive Federal rights that can be enforced under

4

Section 1983.
QUESTION:

5

Ms. Guthrie, do you think that the

6

legislation, as it was written before the Boren Amendment,

7

provided a private cause of action?
MS. GUTHRIE:

8

9

I think, Justice O'Connor, there's

a much better argument that could be made there, but we

10

would not concede that point.

11

difference in the language between the Boren Amendment and

12

its predecessor.

13

language is to incorporate the express findings and

14

assurances requirement and also to expressly repeal the

15

cost-based reimbursement standard reflected in the prior

16

language.

17

There is a distinct

And that language -- the change in the

The prior language said that a state plan for

18

medical assistance must provide for the payment of the

19

reasonable cost of in-patient hospital services.

20

language is somewhat similar in nature to other standards

21

incorporated in the Social Security Act that this Court

22

has held enforceable.

23

That

But what's important about the Boren Amendment

24

is that it doesn't say that anymore, that it makes a very

25

significant change that must not be overlooked by this

Court.

2

intention to interject the free enterprise system into the

3

Medicaid program.

4

The Boren Amendment reflects congressional

Under cost-based reimbursement, hospitals could

5

argue that they were entitled, essentially, to present a

6

bill to the Commonwealth and to have it paid, regardless

7

of whether the charges made or the bill presented was in

8

fact necessarily related to the services that the Medicaid

9

recipients were entitled to.

10

It is that fundamental

change that we would stress in this case.
And our second important point today is that the

11

12

language of the Boren Amendment itself doesn't secure any

13

substantive Federal rights within the meaning of Section

14

1983.

15

Boren Amendment now imposes on the states is an

16

administrative obligation to make findings and assurances

17

to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, an

18

administrative obligation that relates to how we

19

administer our program, not to any entitlement to

20

hospitals, and certainly not to anything that would

21

remotely resemble an industry subsidy.

The only requirement, we would submit, that the

22

Alternatively, we would argue that even if the

23

Boren Amendment could be said to impose an obligation to

24

make payments to hospitals, the standards for determining

25

the level of payment to be made under the Boren Amendment

1

are too imprecise, too general, too open-ended to secure

2

any specific and Federal — specific and definite Federal

3

rights in any party.

4

QUESTION:

But what about a Federal right to a

5

good-faith determination by the state, and to a good-faith

6

assurance?

7

not?
MS. GUTHRIE:

8

9

At least that is categorical in the act, is it

Your Honor, we would argue that in

fact the finding — the findings and assurances language

10

requires that the Commonwealth be accountable in making

11

assurances to the Secretary, and certainly the presumption

12

of regularity of administrative and state action would

13

obtain.

14

make a finding or submit an assurance that was patently

15

false and inaccurate.

16

And we wouldn't, obviously, expect a state to

QUESTION:

I'm sure you would, but let's assume

17

a state doesn't, and there's all sorts of evidence that

18

this is all tricked up and it's as phony as can be.

19

MS. GUTHRIE:

Well, I think that what I would

20

hear in that particular question and would submit is the

21

proper argument in that particular case is that what the

22

state has done is arbitrary and capricious, and that

23

might, in fact, state some sort of constitutional plane

24

that possibly could be enforced under Section 1983.

25

we would argue that a statement that our findings and

But

1

assurances are arbitrary and capricious does not state a

2

claim under this particular statute.

3

QUESTION:

Could you sue the Secretary under the

4

APA if he accepted those assurances when the assurances

5

were obviously insubstantial?

6

MS. GUTHRIE:

We — we think that there's an

7

argument that could be made that the Administrative

8

Procedure Act would permit someone to sue the Secretary

9

for not living up to his obligations, but we do not

10

believe that argument is persuasive in this case because

11

of the nature of the right arguably created, which is one

12

to findings and assurances.

13

assurances that are required are so defined by what comes

14

after that language that by their terms they are more like

15

the indefinite language this Court recently referred to in

16

Webster v. Doe, language that might even foreclose a

17

proper Administrative Procedure Act review.

18

And the findings and

The findings and assurances require the state to

19

make a number of different, almost legislative, certainly

20

policy-laden judgments.

21

language of the statute, it says that a state plan for

22

medical assistance must provide for payment of hospital

23

services through the use of rates, so we're making payment

24

for the use of rates, which the state finds and makes

25

assurances satisfactory to the Secretary are reasonable

First, if you look at the actual

1

and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by

2

efficiently and economically operated facilities in order

3

to provide care and services in conformity with applicable

4

quality and safety standards and state and Federal laws,

5

and to assure individuals eligible for medical assistance

6

have reasonable access.

7

Buried in that somewhat labyrinthine language

8

which is added to an already -- which you have already

9

characterized as a byzantine statute, are several mandates

10

for findings:

11

the care and services that must be provided in conformity

12

with applicable state and Federal laws and regulations and

13

quality and safety standards.

14

one, the state has to look to see what is

And once we know what the level of care that's

15

required is, then we have to ask, now, what are the costs

16

that have to be incurred — have to be incurred by an

17

economically and efficiently operated hospital in order to

18

provide that level of care?

19

what those mandated costs are -- because economic and

20

efficient here is a limitation, not an expansion.

21

meant to avoid overpayment, not to raise questions about

22

underpayment.

23

And once we've determined

It's

Once we know the answer to the question of what

24

costs are necessary, only then do we get to the issue of

25

whether the rates that we set after that analysis are

1

reasonable and adequate to meet those costs.

2

then, once we've established the rates, do we know

3

anything about payments.

4

And only

Now, when you look at that complexity, and when

5

you look at the kinds of judgments that are buried and

6

required of the state in that language, I think it's

7

absolutely necessary to conclude that is the sort of

8

language where there is substantial discretion delegated

9

to the states that it is not the kind of language

10

ordinarily determined by this Court to support a finding

11

of specific and definite rights.

12

Contrast the language of the Boren Amendment not

13

only with its predecessor, which specifically talked about

14

cost-based reimbursement, but contrast it too with

15

sections of the Social Security Act that this Court has

16

already found enforceable, such as Section 1902(a)(8) of

17

the Social Security Act, which is the part of the act that

18

was at issue in Edelman v. Jordan, one of your most

19

important holdings about enforceability of rights under

20

Section 1983, under the Medicaid Act.

21

That section required that a state plan provide

22

that all individuals wishing to made — make application

23

for medical assistance under the plan shall have the

24

opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be

25

furnished by reason -- with reasonable promptness to all

1

eligible individuals.

2

Shall have the opportunity to apply for

3

assistance; that assistance shall be provided with

4

reasonable promptness -- very clear language.

5

that circumstance, the use of the word "reasonable" was

6

interpreted by the Secretary of HHS' regulations, and

7

accordingly could be easily enforced by the courts.

8

Even in

Moreover, the language of the Boren Amendment

9

differs dramatically from the rights-granting language of

10

the Brooke Amendment, which was at issue in the Wright v.

11

Roanoke Development and Housing Authority case.
In Wright, the Court considered the effect of

12

13

statutory language providing that tenants could be charged

14

as rent no more and no less than 30 percent of their

15

income, and the meaning of the — and also looked at the

16

meaning of an implementing regulation that included within

17

that 30 percent standard a reasonable amount for

18

utilities.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

What if a — the state just doesn't

set up any standards at all for reimbursement?
MS. GUTHRIE:

That's not this case.

In this

22

case we have an acknowledgement by Respondent that we have

23

made findings and assurances, and that acknowledgement is

24

bolstered by findings of fact made by Judge Merridge in

25

the Mary Washington Hospital case.

So we're in a

1

circumstance in this particular case where that question

2

is not an issue.

3

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if they didn't have a

4

set of standards they wouldn't have presented anything to

5

the Secretary, would they?

6

MS. GUTHRIE:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I take it you suggested that if

8

neither the state nor the Secretary was doing its job,

9

somebody could complain in court?

10

MS. GUTHRIE:

If the state was not doing its

11

job, if we did not submit satisfactory assurances, if

12

we've made no payments, for example, the Secretary —

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. GUTHRIE:

So what -- who can sue whom for what?
Well, the Secretary certainly in

15

the first instance can refuse to approve our state plan,

16

can withdraw his approval and can refuse to provide

17

Federal participation

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. GUTHRIE:

20

our actions were so --

Can somebody sue?

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. GUTHRIE:

Yes.

As I indicated earlier, if

Can somebody sue the state?
If our actions were wholly

23

arbitrary and capricious, I think that we would

24

acknowledge that there would be a constitutional claim to

25

which a 1983 action might attach.

isn't it constitutional to have the Secretary protect —

10

All of the information has to be given to him.

Why

That's their assurance -Well, I think --

And if the Secretary doesn't do the

job, then the hospitals can sue him?
MS. GUTHRIE:

I think that that's certainly a

11

reasonable interpretation.

12

that because of the level of state action involved in

13

promulgating the state plan that's at issue here -- we

14

have to promulgate a state plan under our Administrative

15

Procedure Act as well as under the public notice and other

16

requirements of the Federal law in this particular

17

provision, and so we have state action —

MS. GUTHRIE:

I was only meaning to suggest

I see.

cooperative program that might be independently attacked,

you know, as arbitrary and capricious.

QUESTION:

I understand.

If you can sue when

23

you don't have a plan, why can't you sue and just say

24

look, the plan that was presented is just wholly arbitrary

and capricious, so I want to sue the state?

I want to --

1

it's just a — it's a nonplan, and look at these rates,

2

they're just too low?
MS. GUTHRIE:

3

In that circumstance, this statute

4

is one that clearly sets up a scheme that contemplates

5

that the states will be accountable and the Secretary will

6

be charged principally with assuring that the states

7

follow the mandate of Congress.

8

There is embodied in the statute a delegation to

9

the states which is very broad and a recognition that this

10

program is going to work only if it is a cooperative

11

program of the state and Federal Government.
QUESTION:

12

Well, does the state have a procedure

13

whereby a provider can say look, you aren't paying me

enough?

Yes.

are two major respects in which the language prior to 1980

was very different.

QUESTION:

Why, I -- I understand that.

But

2

basically you're saying, then, that even if there was, we

3

should construe the Boren Amendment as taking away a

4

preexisting remedy?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think it's different than

6

in the implied right-of-action cases.

7

for example, like the Merrill Lynch case, where if

8

Congress -- Congress did not provide a judicial right of

9

action even prior to 1980.

10

I don't think it's,

The question is whether the language it used

11

secured a right which then could be enforced under 1983.

12

So I don't think you should look for particular evidence

13

that they were withdrawing a judicial remedy.

14

construe the language of the statute to see if it secures

15

a right, and in this case, looking first at the standard

16

for payment, that standard is not the sort of language

17

that suggests Congress intended there to be judicial

18

policing of rates.

19

QUESTION:

You simply

How do we tell —
Is there some kind of right of action

20

to require the state to include reimbursement provisions

21

in the plan?

22

23
24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

The statute requires that the

state plan have a provision for payment of rates.
QUESTION:

Is there -- is there a cause of

action to require at least that much?

1

MR. ROBERTS:

There may well be, if the

2

allegation in the complaint is that the state plan — the

3

state has not made findings that its rates meet this

4

standard, or that the state has not given assurances to

5

the Secretary at all.

6

these plaintiffs seek.

7

QUESTION:

But that's not the relief that

Is there a reguirement that the state

act rationally in making those findings?

rise to a cause of action?

It is

11

only -- the only thing that the act requires is state

12

findings and state assurances.

court to look behind those findings and assurances.

14

is not the pre-1980 situation, where the statute said the

only requirements are that the state find that its rates

meet this level and assure the Secretary.

MR. ROBERTS:

In the first place, Your Honor, I

didn't mean to suggest that you should sue the Secretary.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

You're saying

I think that's right, Your Honor,

12

and I don't think that's an absurd conclusion.

The

Your Honor, the only requirement — that's — that goes to

2

the standard against which the state must make its

3

findings and assurances, but the only mandate in the

4

statute is that findings be made, assurances be given and

5

the Secretary's approval obtained.
That is, of course, very different from the

6

7

situation prior to 1980, when these lower case — court

8

cases were decided, when the repeal of the Eleventh

9

Amendment immunity and the repeal of the repealer took

10

place.
Perhaps there was a right of action at that

Congress was trying to do when they made this change, when

22

they inserted the requirement of findings and assurances.

24

to the Secretary is that they wanted the Secretary to back

off.

His review was not to look at the rates, but to

2

assure proper accountability, to make sure that the

findings were made, and it seems curious to suggest at the

same time that Congress was pulling the Secretary back, it

nonetheless intended that every provider have a right to

challenge the level of its rates in Federal court before a

Federal judge.
QUESTION:

9

is it?

Well, that isn't quite that absurd,

And I suppose the standard would be quite

different if the Secretary would take a fresh look and

decide whether it was right, whereas they'd have a much

heavier burden in court, wouldn't they, to show the

Each of them, however, is quite convinced that

10

somehow, some significant change was made in 1981 which

11

retracts this right that in our view was not only settled,

12

but a right with which Congress was extremely well aware.

13

Providers have been suing under these

reimbursement agreements -- under these reimbursement

standards of Congress for more than 20 years.

In the 1980 and '81 amendments for nursing

The state — and we emphatically agree with

this — with the state on this point.

States are not

They are required to reimburse at a level that must be

incurred by efficient and economical providers in

providing care.

12

There's nothing in that change in the standard

which continues to be enforceable and mandatory.

MR. DELLINGER:

This Court never had occasion to

hold that there was a cause of action under the previous

statute, but the sense of Congress on that point could not

23

be clearer.

Congress

1

twice in the '70s passed legislation expressly predicated

2

on the existence of an underlying cause of actions upon

QUESTION:

Do you think that was a -- the cause

of action given by the act?

6

MR. DELLINGER:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

Absolutely.

Or do you have to get to 1983 or

something?
MR. DELLINGER:

Well, the secured right comes

10

from the Medicaid Act, the cause of action under 1983.

11

The court decisions in the lower courts were, in the main,

12

explicitly based on 1983.

13

Congress became concerned in 1975 that the 1983

14

cause of action for future injunctive relief wasn't enough

15

of a remedy.

16

against Jordan, a provider who sued in the '70s and

17

challenged the state for failing the meet the minimum

18

reimbursement standard could not receive compensatory

19

damages because of the Eleventh Amendment barrier.

20

Because of this Court's decision in Edelman

So Congress in 1975 passed legislation requiring

21

states to waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity and

22

consent to be sued not only for injunctive relief but for

23

money damages as well.

24
25

That did not work out very well.

Many state

legislatures simply weren't meeting in time to comply by

March 31 of the ensuing year, and the penalty was

2

draconian -- a 10 percent cut in Medicaid reimbursement to

3

the state -- so the Congress in '76 withdrew, repealed the

4

statute which required states to waive their Eleventh

5

Amendment immunity.

6

It obviously makes no sense to require a waiver

7

of Eleventh Amendment immunity if there's no underlying

8

right to sue, but Congress could not have been clearer and

9

the Solicitor General in his brief in the final footnote,

10

page 23, note 16, notes that the House and Senate report

11

explicitly state — they say observe in passing —

12

explicitly state, with an interesting ellipsis here, that

13

after the repeal "providers can continue" dot, dot, dot,

14

"to institute suit for injunctive relief in state or

15

Federal courts."

16

The ellipsed matter is:

", of course,".

I

17

mean, it was so well established that this statement —

18

the position of Undersecretary Marjorie Lynch in her

19

testimony, Assistant Secretary Kersman, the repeal of this

20

legislation — should not be interpreted as placing

21

constraints on the right of parties to seek prospective

22

injunctive relief in a state or Federal judicial forum.

23

It could not have been clearer that "of course" providers

24

had a right to sue to enforce this standard.

QUESTION:

11

So if there is a cause of action it's

12

only to assure that the action of the state is not

14

MR. DELLINGER:

That has not been finally

settled in the lower courts that have heard this so far.

16

It may well be that that's where the standard comes out,

because the statutory language is "reasonable and

20

That obviously gives the state some room and

2

the Solicitor General concedes, as he must, that there was

3

a right to sue before '80 and '81, and one of the

4

principal changes in 1980 and '81 was to reduce the

5

oversight role of the Federal Secretary.
QUESTION:

6

I think

But you would have us increase the

7

Federal oversight by virtue of having the Federal courts

8

do what the Secretary cannot do?

No.

The court's role is simply

10

to see that the Federal statute has been enforced, that it

11

has been complied with by the states.

Do you think there's a private cause

Yes, and in fact the access to

role has been diminished, that is, prior to 1980 and '81

it was more arguable that the Secretary's function, which

QUESTION:

Now, this has been

Well, it's kind of curious as an end

One might think that what Congress had in
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

mind was a reduced Federal involvement across the board,

2

whether it's through the courts or the Secretary.
MR. DELLINGER:

3

There's absolutely no evidence

4

of that in the legislative history, of reducing the role

5

of the courts.
What Congress did want to do is to decentralize

6

7

the function of adopting a reimbursement methodology.

8

Previously, the Secretary had exercised something like a

9

command and control function.

When the Secretary engaged

10

in that function, conceivably there could have been

11

meaningful APA review.
QUESTION:

12

What's his function now, Mr.

13

Dellinger?

What is the Secretary supposed to do now, just

14

file them?

He's not supposed to look at them at all?

15

MR. DELLINGER:

That is the position of the

16

Department of Justice, that the Secretary -- in its brief,

17

the Solicitor General says, at page 5 of its brief, "The

18

states are not required to submit to the Secretary the

What do you think he has to do?
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

I mean, the way

1

you've just been talking, he's been read out of the act.

2

Is that so?
MR. DELLINGER:

3

I think that is largely correct.

4

That is, at page 20 of their brief the Solicitor General

5

says that "consistent with this legislative history, the

6

Secretary has maintained" — whether he gets Chevron

7

deference in this judgment I don't know, but the Secretary

8

has maintained that the statutory provision "does not

9

require him to analyze or verify the state's findings,"

10

partly because we've now switched to a system from one in

11

which the Secretary had a command and control function.
There are other areas of the Medicaid Act where

12

13

the Secretary continues to be the effective decision­

14

maker, but here Congress has decentralized to the point

15

where it is the state which finds that its plan meets the

16

requirement of the statute of being reasonable and

17

adequate reimbursement.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Dellinger, supposing you win

19

here, and then the Arlington Hospital goes into court and

20

sues a year from now saying we incurred $10 million in

21

costs, the Virginia people have only reimbursed us for $8

22

million.

23
24
25

So what issues -- what issues could a Federal
court consider in deciding that case?
MR. DELLINGER:

Well, the fact that they had

2

reimbursed them $8 million would by no means suggest that

3

they were entitled to win.
QUESTION:

4
5

What issues could the Federal court

consider?

6

MR. DELLINGER:

I think if you look at the cases

7

that have gone to judgment in the Courts of Appeal, and we

8

have a number now that have been decided, you can see the

9

process that the Federal court -- a Federal court can go

10

through.
The state officials are asked to, in a sense

11

12

come forward and explain how their system was designed and

13

what is the theory that this is a reasonable and adequate

14

rates that would meet the costs that must be incurred.

15

That is not an impossible finding.

Can you think of any other instances

where we have Federal courts passing upon the adequacy of

Well, there have been, I think,

18

in the history of this provision only 42 actions brought.

19

I assume that in most cases -- there are only suits

20

pending in 18 states at the present time. I think most

21

states are in fact in compliance, judging by those

22

figures.

23

They are -- they have a variety of different

24

methodologies, just in the way in that, when we get our

25

travel expenses reimbursed there are lots of different

ways in which payers calculate our travel expenses, but
all of them seem to be a method to determine -- to be in -

3

- actually a method of determining reasonableness and

4

adequacy.

5

But you have cases, like the Colorado case

6

brought by St. Mark's Hospital and Denver Lutheran that

7

has now gone to judgment in the court of appeals, in which

8

the state — again it was a case like Virginia's where not

9

a single hospital -- not 90 percent but 100 percent -- not

LO

a single hospital was receiving -- was being reimbursed

LI

its cost of providing care.

L2

In Colorado, the state's method was to use one

L3

of the Medicare methods of determining cost per patient

L4

day, and at the next-to-bottom line the state simply

L5

multiplies by .54.

L6

They simply cut the amount in half.

That's not a very difficult judgment for a court

17

to make, and particularly when the state has no theory.

18

It's as if they said, we take the numbers and multiply

19

them by last Tuesday's trifecta number.

»0

I mean, the trial court asked the state, by what

method or theory do you assume that multiplying by .54 and

cutting the figures in half will result in reimbursement

The order was simply, in that

case, to hold that the state plan was -- failed to meet

That's right.

There's no

come up with a new plan, which Colorado has done.

QUESTION:

4

In your view, is there an action

against the Secretary under the APA?
MR. DELLINGER:

5

If there is an action against

6

the Secretary under the APA, there would be very little

7

for the court to review because the Secretary's role is so

8

limited and the Department of Justice has taken the

9

position, as it did in Illinois Health Care v. Suiter —

10

the Department of Justice moves to dismiss the Secretary

MR. DELLINGER:

Here's the state's

And we respond with that; to which they say

administrative review of those principles, you went into

Conceivably the Virginia Supreme

Court would decide differently, but it's important to note

11

that once you're closed out of the state administrative

12

appeals process, because it doesn't allow you to challenge

13

the principles of reimbursement, there's nothing in the

14

Federal Medicaid Act that requires state court judicial

15

review.

16

So that any review that might exist by

17

happenstance, the availability of which would be entirely

18

a matter of individual state law, cannot, as this Court

held in Wright v. City of Roanoke, foreclose a remedy

There's not a word that Congress was withdrawing a

right of which Congress was fully and clearly aware.
It seems to me that two approaches have been

12

13

argued here today to take away the right to sue.

One of

14

those approaches would have this Court hold that a state's

15

plan always meets the statutory standard, no matter how

16

arbitrary, capricious, unsupported or untrue its plan

17

might be.
The other would acknowledge the existence of the

18
19

statutory right but shut the doors of the state and

20

Federal courthouses to the only effective means that

21

providers have of enforcing the requirements of this

22

statute.

I think either one of those approaches would

breathe an unhealthy skepticism and a lack of respect for
