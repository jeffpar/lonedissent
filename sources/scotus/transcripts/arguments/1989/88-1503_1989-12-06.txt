CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Director of the Missouri Department of Health.

Mr. Colby.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. COLBY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. COLBY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Nancy Cruzan is a 32-year-old Missouri woman who

12

is in a persistent vegetative case.

13

case is a specific clinical diagnosis for a patient who is

14

permanently unconscious.

15

Persistent vegetative

All thought, all memory, all ability to interact

16

with the world around her in any way is gone.

17

undisputed in the record below that Nancy will never

18

recover from this condition and will never interact with

19

the world around her.

20

It is

She's been in this condition for over six years,

21

the result of a car accident.

Approximately three weeks

22

after the accident, when hope for her recovery remained

23

strong, her parents and her husband at the time consented

24

to the surgical insertion of a gastrostomy tube necessary

25

to feed Nancy.

No one told the Cruzans at that time that their

1
2

consent was irrevocable; no one suggested to them that the

3

purpose of this surgical insertion of the tube was to

4

perpetuate Nancy in an unconscious state indefinitely.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Colby, is it clear — I'm — I'm

6

not sure it — it seems to me that there may be some

7

dispute on the point as to whether she could have been fed

8

manually if that had not been done.

9

opponents say that it is — it would have been more

Apparently your

10

difficult, but that she could have been fed manually by —

11

by massaging the food down her throat or something of that

12

sort.

13

Is that correct or not?

14

MR. COLBY:

I think that is — is not correct.

15

At the time the tube was inserted, Nancy had just come out

16

of intensive care.

17

completely clear in the record, but it appears both a

18

nasogastric tube and through an I.V. tube.

19

She was being fed through — it's not

It was clear that her long-term care was going

20

to require more nutrition, and the operational report for

21

the surgery stated that the reason for the surgery was

22

malnutrition.

23

After the tube was inserted, when she

24

transferred out of the hospital and into the

25

rehabilitation center, they attempted to feed her through

1

mouth while she still had the tube in place, but they were

2

not able to feed her sufficiently to provide for her

3

needs.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Colby, at the time the family

5

said, yes, go ahead and insert the feeding tube, if they

6

had refused that permission, would the state law have

7

required that refusal to be honored?

8

consent required at the time for the insertion of the

9

tube?
MR. COLBY:

10
11

The family's consent was required

for the surgery to insert the tube.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. COLBY:

14

QUESTION:

15

Was the family's

By state law?
By state law.

It would have been --

Is that by statute or by some state

common law?

16

MR. COLBY:

By common law.

It would have been a

17

battery for the doctor to perform a surgery without

18

consent.

19

Missouri is in the event there is an emergency.

20

that's defined in the Missouri statute as a person is in

21

imminent danger of dying and there was no one around to

22

provide the necessary consent.

23

QUESTION:

And the only statutory exception to that in

Well, what if they refused?

And

Is there

24

a procedure then, whereby the state would go in and have a

25

guardian appointed?

Or does the state, if -the patient is

^

1

in a state hospital, simply accept that refusal and allow

2

the patient to die of malnutrition?
MR. COLBY:

3

It is my belief that had they

4

refused — refused, the state would have accepted that

5

refusal and that Nancy would have died not from

6

malnutrition, but from the severe brain damage from her

7

accident shortly before then.

family —
QUESTION:

9

Had the doctor advised the

Is that a prediction of fact or is

10

that a statement of law?

You say it's your belief that

11

they would have accepted it.

12

accepted it?

Would the state have to have

I mean suppose the parents were Christian

13
14

Scientists, or for some reason did not want a relatively

15

ordinary surgical procedure to be performed, would the

16

state have to — would the state have to accept that

17

determination, or would the state not be able to appoint a

18

guardian and have the guardian make it?

19

MR. COLBY:

The state would not necessarily have

20

to accept that determination, and certainly there are

21

Instances like the Jehovah's Witness cases where the state

22

will intervene and take steps to — provide the medical

23

treatment.

24
25

My statement is that, in this case, where the
parents would have been — had a doctor come to them and

said, there's virtually no chance your daughter is going

2

to recover from this car accident, we want to do this

3

surgery, we need your consent to do it, and the parents

4

said, I don't want to give that consent, I don't think

5

she's going to recover, the doctors would have honored

6

that requested.

7

Now, if the decision is considered abusive, if

8

it's considered one that's not among acceptable medical

9

alternatives, then the state has an interest in

10
11

intervening.
The issue before this case — before this Court

12

today is a narrow one.

13

order a person to receive invasive medical treatment when

14

that order is contrary to the wishes of the family, when

15

it overrides all available evidence about the person's

16

wishes from prior to the accident, when the decision to

17

forego treatment is among acceptable medical alternatives

18

and when the state gives no specific justification for

19

that intrusion other than their general interest in life.

20

We submit that the Fourteenth Amendment and the

And it is whether a state can

21 '

liberty guarantee there protects individuals, conscious or

22

unconscious, from such invasion by the state, without any

23

particularized interest for that invasion.

QUESTION:

Mr. Colby, do you think that a

competent adult has an absolute constitutional right to

1

refuse food and water?
MR. COLBY:

2

I believe a competent adult has an

3

extremely strong right to refuse the surgery necessary to

4

provide a gastrostomy feeding tube when that person has

5

lost the natural ability to swallow.
QUESTION:

6

7

How about if no feeding tube is

required?

8

MR. COLBY:

9

QUESTION:

And what would the mechanism be?
Can the — can the adult, the

10

competent adult absolutely refuse food and water in a

11

hospital setting, and the state can't override that

12

decision?

13

MR. COLBY:

There could be situations where that

14

decision may be considered irrational or abusive,, and the

15

state could override that — that decision, I believe.

16

But if we're —

17
18
19

QUESTION:

The individual isn't very competent

then.
MR. COLBY:

That may well be right.

In the case

20

of suicide, for example, that's a situation where we

21

presume that the decision is irrational.

22

person is refusing to eat, the state may well have a need

23

to override that decision.

24
25

QUESTION:

And if that

Why do you presume it's irrational?

I mean, let's assume the person is in a state close to as

hopeless as this individual here, and the person says, I

2

want to die.

3

die.

I am of sound mind and it is my desire to

4

MR. COLBY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. COLBY:

It would be difficult —
Could a state overrule that?
It would be difficult for a person

7

to be in a state close to the vegetative state and — and

8

be competent.
QUESTION:

9

Well — well, then change it from a

10

vegetative state, it's just a state of enormous pain,

11

deformity, quality of life is — is — is nil, and the

12

person says, I want to die.
MR. COLBY:

13
14

Could that patient refuse surgery to

insert a gastrostomy tube?
QUESTION:

15

Absolutely.

No, I'm asking Justice O'Connor's

16

question.

17

must the state allow that person to refuse food and water?

18

Must — must the state allow that person —

MR. COLBY:

I believe they — they do have an

19

obligation and that the Fourteenth Amendment protects that

20

person's right to be free from a state intrusion.

21

long as that decision is not considered irrational, then

22

the state does not have a reason to intrude.

And as

23

QUESTION:

Now, can that —

24

QUESTION:

Well, what — what's your — what's

25

your standard for — for irrationality?

Do you mean it's

1

an objective test; someone else decides whether a person's

2

particular decision is rational or not?

3

MR. COLBY:

There no doubt is a continuum, and

4

all kinds of decisions will be made along that continuum.

5

There will be some situations where the state is going to

6

have a greater need to intervene where a decision is going

7

to seem inappropriate.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Well, who — what does inappropriate

mean?
MR. COLBY:

If, for example — and take the

11

example of the Jehovah's Witness case.

12

not based on the best interest of the individual, it's

13

based on the parents' religious belief.

14

The decision is

The medical community believes, in that case,

15

that a simple medical procedure will restore the person to

16

life and give them a full chance to interact in society.

17

That decision is presumed irrational.

18

I'm not certain that there's any specific test,

19

but in this specific case, where we have the factors that

20

Nancy is in a vegetative state, that she's permanently

21

unconscious, that the family — that her wishes — she

22

said to a friend a year before this accident,

23

want to live life as a vegetable."

2

never be terminated.

3

that?

4

MR. COLBY:

5

QUESTION:

Would the state have to respect

Yes.
Well, in this case, then, if the

6

state has to respect both wishes, cannot we view this case

7

as being one in which the state simply is saying that

8

there must be a mechanism where the state can make a clear

9

determination of what the wishes were one way or the

10

other, and if that determination cannot be made, the state

11

simply opts for life.

12

case comes to us?

13

MR. COLBY:

Is that the — is that the way this

Certainly, the state has an

14

important interest in protecting life, and they have an

15

interest in making certain that appropriate decisions are

16

made about medical treatment, but to simply say that in

17

all situations we are going to err on the side of life, to

18

say that we have an unqualified interest in life that is

19

going to, in essence, win in every case —

QUESTION:

No, it's not — it's not all

situations.

23

understands it.

1

get you to the second question, which is, if we don't know

2

for certain what this person's wishes are, how are we

3

going to decide about medical treatment?

4

going to decide in every instance, or is the patient's

5

family going to decide to be involved in that decision?

Is the state

6

QUESTION:

7

that question here?

8

evidence is just insufficient to really know what the

9

patient's wishes were.

10
11

Don't we — don't we have to get to
Because the state said that the

You don't ask us to overturn that

factual assessment of the evidence, do you, or not?
MR. COLBY:

Certainly, in the past, this Court

12

has, in a situation where an intermediate appellate court

13

has carved out parts of the trial record and look at only

14

specific facts, and in doing so denied an important

15

liberty interest, this Court has looked at the whole

16

record and I think you can do that here, and we submit

17

that there is clear evidence of her wishes.

18

But even assuming the evidence is unequivocal,

19

the standard that the Court below applied to the evidence

20

that they reviewed — the Court below said the only

21

evidence we're going to look at are specific statements

22

that Nancy Cruzan made before her accident.

23

other evidence that the finder of fact relied on, we're

24

disregarding.

evidence and they said we're -- we have in Missouri an

2

unqualified interest in life.

3

limited amount of evidence a standard that is so high that

4

the state always wins.
QUESTION:

We're applying to this

But if you lose on that, then you

6

must get to the question of the — of the authority of the

7

parents.

8
9

MR. COLBY:

If we lose on that, then we get to

the question of, if the evidence is unclear, then who

10

decides?

Nancy Cruzan said, I hope my family would know I

11

wouldn't want to live life as a vegetable, and she said to

12

her friend, that's important because families get to make

13

these kinds of decisions.

14

that she thought she was dealing with.

15

always deferred to the special competence of families to

16

know what values are important to family members.

17

in Nancy's best interest, how she lived, her value system

That's the kind of framework
This Court has

Excuse me, but you said before that

we don't.

says, my child would not want medical treatment, the state

22

will intervene and say, we don't care.

That in the case of a Jehovah's Witness who

Your child will.

23

Now, you say that that's a religious belief and

24

therefore it can be disregarded, but isn't — and this —

25

but isn't this a philosophical belief?

Is that any

I mean, some people think living is better than

view of the matter.

That's a philosophical

Why can't the state take a position, we don't

10

deal with philosophy, we deal with physics, and life will

11

be preserved?

12

MR. COLBY:

Because if the state does that, and

13

it says we are going to intrude in every unconscious

14

person's life if we don't have express information as to

15

their wishes, then they're going to deny important rights

16

to incompetent people.

17

At the one end of the spectrum, if you look at

18

the Jehovah's Witnesses there, Nancy Cruzan's case must be

19

at the complete other end of the spectrum, and that's the

20

only question before the Court today.

21

A permanently unconscious person, the American

22

Medical Association, the President's Commission and, I

23

would submit, even the Attorney General of Missouri would

24

say that it's different if you're permanently unconscious

25

and have no hope of ever recovering consciousness.

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Colby, in that situation, a

2

person acknowledged to be in a persistent vegetative

3

state, do you think that there is some kind of per se

4

rule, or presumption that federal — the federal

5

Constitution mandates be applied, that that person would

6

prefer to die?

7

state must, because of the federal Constitution, apply

8

some kind of a presumption there?

I mean, is that your position?

MR. COLBY:

9

That the

There certainly is a presumption,

10

Your Honor, that before the state can intrude and order

11

that person to receive medical treatment at the order of

12

the state for the rest of their life, that the state has

to show some specific reason for doing that.

QUESTION:

1

Do you think the federal

2

Constitution, then, says that the state can't require

3

clear and convincing evidence, for example?
MR. COLBY:

4

As applied in this case, I would

5

submit that — the State of Missouri, the opinion of the

6

Court below, says "clear and convincing evidence" at only

7

one place, and at that place they say,

8

convincing, inherently reliable evidence."

At’four other places in the opinion, the Court

below says, we won't allow an unconscious person to

exercise these rights absent rigid formalities.

convincing proof, and that's the very issue in the case.

MR. COLBY:

We know there's life

Justice Kennedy, I believe, based on

16

the decisions of this Court, that there certainly is a

17

liberty interest of people, conscious and unconscious, to

18

be free from invasions of the body that the state has

19

ordered.

20

So if we are trying to figure out — we started

21

with Justice O'Connor's question — what the proper burden -

22

of proof is here, if you look at the decisions in

23

Matthew^, the decisions in Santosky, and are trying to

24

figure out where the disutility of error falls, if one

25

right should be respected substantially more than another

Well, the value of family decision­

Mr. Colby, I don't know any other

the state considers an unreasonable one, the state will

make the decision.

leads?

That if the state decides that the family members,

in deciding that this person would want to live, or ought

to live, if the state decides that those family members

are unreasonable, that no one, as you say, would want to

can take into account the resources available to care for

that the probate court might take account the resources

I -- I believe the -- the question

was could Missouri exclude anything other than statements.
If, for instance, the State of Missouri said we
will not allow anyone, competent or otherwise, to refuse
nutrition, hydration because we think that amounts to —
state-sanctioned suicide, I would submit that that
presents vastly different issues because it is an exercise
of the state's police power.
Here we are talking more particularly about the

QUESTION:

Well, what is your answer to that

I was going to ask you that very question

because here the state relied on the general interest in
life.

Would that general interest be sufficient to

require that life be maintained even when the patent had
unequivocally executed the kind of instrument that Justice
Scalia described?
MR. PRESSON:

If we are talking specifically

about the nutrition, hydration, I believe that would be an
acceptable choice.
QUESTION:

Is that based on the assumption that

a — that the state could override a competent person's
refusal to receive medical treatment?
MR. PRESSON:

Not medical treatment in general.

I would base that on, I believe, that the state could

Before addressing the constitutional issue in

points that, based on my study of this record, I believe

merit the Court's attention.

First, the medical care providers in this case,

those who care for Nancy at Mount Vernon, are not in

agreement with the family's decision.

That is the context of

Now, as to the constitutional issues before the

Court, we believe that in this highly sensitive and deeply

vexing area, that the due process clause should not be

6

interpreted to force the states and the federal

7

government, with its many health-care facilities, to

8

embrace a particular procedure or approach to the

9

treatment or care of incompetent persons.

10

To the contrary, we believe that the due process

clause should be interpreted to provide the states and the

12

federal government with wide latitude that — wide

13

latitude to develop approaches that reflect reasonably the

14

values of the people, that states should not be forced to

15

use the Massachusetts model, which Missouri has now

16

embraced, a model of active state judicial involvement

through a probate judge.

Nor, on the other hand, should they be forced to

19

use the Minnesota model or the Arizona model.

these matters are entrusted to the decision of the health

the same evidentiary standard with respect to the

10

and hydration in the absence of clear and convincing proof

11

of the patient's intent.

12

That was also the approach of the Massachusetts

13

Supreme Judicial course — Court in the Brophy case.

14

There, they concluded that the evidence was powerful in

15

Paul Brophy's case.

16

Appeals, in In re Eichner, concluded that .the evidence was

17

powerful there.

18

So, too, the New York Court of

But I believe, based on my review of the record

19

in this case, that this case may very well have been

20

decided precisely the same way in both New York and

21

Massachusetts.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. General, in New York, if the

23

evidence is clear and convincing with respect to food and

24

hydration, the choice would be honored?

25

MR. STARR:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

The state could not say this is

tantamount to suicide and we may override that choice?
MR. STARR:

That is correct, as a matter of

4

common law right, and that is my reading of the Missouri

5

Supreme Court's opinion.

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but suppose the state did say

7

that we just put food and hydration in a different

8

category and we never will do it no matter what the

9

evidence is.

10

What about the due process clause?

MR. STARR:

I think there are significant

11

limitations that the state could properly,

12

constitutionally place on any such decision.

QUESTION:

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

under the due process clause?

17

MR. STARR:

And that's one of them?
I beg your pardon?
And so the state could not do that

Oh, I'm sorry.

The state could very

18

well require, before — before any such decision was made,

19

any number of steps to be taken.

QUESTION:

21

MR. STARR:

22

QUESTION:

Well, I know but suppose —
But could there be an absolute rule?
Suppose the state says, we're never

23

going to honor a choice by the patient or by the parents

24

or anybody else where food and hydration is concerned?

25

Would the due process clause forbid that?

QUESTION:

But Mr. Solicitor General, I would be

11

interested, could there be a case in which the federal

Constitution would require relief for the patient, in your

13

view, or is it absolutely up to the states, 100 percent?

14

At least you have — you must have a position on that.

MR. STARR:

Oh, I think if in fact the state was

16

conducting itself in what reasonable judges viewed as an

17

oppressive way —

QUESTION:

MR. STARR:

Well —

Constitution would speak to that.

Let's give a specific example,

patient was suffering continuous pain.

evidence of the intent of the patient; everybody agreed

If Judge Starr is correct, I have

read the opinion below too broadly and all it stands for

is the proposition that this state hospital cannot be
