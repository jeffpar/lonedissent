CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now in

No. 88-6025, Reuben Dowling against the United States.
Mr. Tucker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. TUCKER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. TUCKER:

Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.
The issue that we bring before the Court today

11

involves the issues concerning what role the Constitution

12

plays, and more specifically, the Fifth Amendment, when the

13

government, in a criminal case, attempts to introduce evidence

14

of so-called other crimes evidence under rule 404(b), when, in

15

fact, the defendant has previously been tried for that very

16

conduct and found not guilty.

17

We suggest to the Court that the introduction of

18

this evidence violates — excuse me — the defendant's rights

19

under both the double jeopardy and due process clauses of the

20

Fifth Amendment.

21

QUESTION:

You're not making any rule, then, that

22

404(b) doesn't authorize it or should be construed not to

23

authorize it?

24
25

MR. TUCKER:

In this particular case, no.

Although

the Third Circuit did, alternatively, hold, on that basis,

that issue is really not before the Court, in our view of the

2

case -QUESTION:

3

Well, of course, the Court ordinarily

4

doesn't want to reach constitutional questions if there's a

5

different -- if it's a statutory ground in which to decide it.

6

MR. TUCKER:

Well, in this case, if, in fact, the

7

evidence violates the defendant's rights under the

8

Constitution, the court would have to apply a different

9

harmless error standard.
I suppose that the court could decide that the

10
11

issue, as the Third Circuit —
QUESTION:

12

13

kind of evidence?

14
15

Yeah, but what if the rules forbid this

MR. TUCKER:

If rule 404(b), a straight 404(b)

analysis for — forbids the evidence?

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. TUCKER:

Do you argue that or not?
We didn't argue it in our — our cert

18

petition, and the reason we didn't is this.

19

the evidence is inadmissible, as the Third Circuit

20

alternatively held under a straight 404(b) analysis, then when

21

the court goes to the harmless error standard, it would apply

22

the statutory harmless error standard, as did the Third

23

Circuit.

24
25

If rule 40 — if

Now, not -- we're not conceding that the Third
Circuit correctly applied that standard, but we do concede

1

that that would be the proper standard to apply if it's a rule

2

404(b) violation.

3

The cert petition basically raises the issue that

4

the Third Circuit applied the wrong harmless error standard;

5

that, in fact, they were -- should have applied the standard

6

mandated by Chapman v. California, because, indeed, the

7

evidence was not only admiss -- inadmissible pursuant to rule

8

404(b), but it was a violation of the Constitution.

9

QUESTION:

I see.

10

QUESTION:

But you say you're -- you're not

11

presenting here and you're not arguing the rule 404(b) point.

12

13

MR. TUCKER:

We didn't present it in the cert

petition.

14

Let — let me -- let me put it this way, Mr. Chief

15

Justice.

16

it would certainly have the power to review that and decide on

17

that basis.

18

we merely to have raised that issue before the court, what we

19

simply would have been asking the court to do was — would be

20

just factually review a harmless error determination.

I think that now that the court has the entire case,

As far as the cert petition itself, were — were

21

I -- I would say this, it is our position that the

22

evidence is inadmissible to a straightforward application of

23

rule 404(b); and that, in fact, the Third Circuit, while

24

applying the right standard, nonetheless, we disagree with

25

their factual conclusion as to whether or not it was still

2

harmless error.
But if this court were to hold that yes, indeed, the

3

evidence is inadmissible under rule 404(b), and yes, indeed,

4

it's harmless error under the statutory standard, then the

5

court would still have to go to the constitutional issue,

6

because it would have to then look to see if it's a violation

7

of the Constitution, and was it indeed harmless error under

8

that standard.

9

So, I guess in answer to your question, if the court

10

decides to avoid the constitutional issue or not reach the

11

constitutional issue by merely applying rule 404(b) analysis,

12

then we would agree you don't have to reach it if, in fact,

13

you also conclude that the Third Circuit wrongfully applied

14

the harmless error standard.

QUESTION:

was designed to prove character —

MR. TUCKER:

QUESTION:

19
20

Well, this wasn't test — testimony that

No.
-- in order to show that he behaved in a

certain way, was it?
MR. TUCKER:

No, it was certainly not offered for

21

that purpose; it was offered for the purpose of — QUESTION:

22

And I -- I don't think -- and I don't think we could construe

23

it as offered for that purpose, do you?

24
25

MR. TUCKER:

No, I don't believe it was — it had

that effect —

QUESTION:

1
2

Well, then 404(b) doesn't apply, because

the only thing it prohibits is character evidence.

3

MR. TUCKER:

Well, rule 404(b) could — it was — it

4

was offered for the purpose of proving identity.

5

404(b) could still apply if indeed the evidence was not

6

relevant to that purpose.

7

QUESTION:

There — there are two sentences in

8

404(b); the first prohibits character evidence.

9

agreed, that isn't this.
MR. TUCKER:

10

But rule

And as we

Well, it — it — it — it is, in one

11

sense, but if, in fact — it wasn't offered strictly to that

12

purpose.

13

admissable for the purpose of identity under rule 404(b), that

14

-- that evidence can come in, assuming that other standards

15

are met.

16

It — clearly we admit that if evidence is

But the Third Circuit held that — of course there's

17

numerous cases that hold in order to be admissible for

18

identity, there are certain prerequisites that have to be

19

found.

20

other words, it has to have some relevance, in fact, to

21

identity to enable the jury to infer, based on crime A, the

22

other crimes evidence, that crime B, the one being tried —

23

For instance, either that it's a signature crime -- in

QUESTION:

Well, the -- the purpose for my making

24

the comment is — and it bears on the constitutional argument

25

that I know you're trying to reach — is that you began by

therefore he knew Christian.

not a crime to have a mask -- not a crime to be in the company

It doesn't seem to me this

It was simply the fact that the woman had

And secondly, that she'd seen
It's not an other crime.

It's

It's just a fact that is highly relevant in

MR. TUCKER:

Had the government merely limited the

10

evidence to the fact that Vena Henry, had she testified, yes,

11

I've seen Reuben Dowling in the company of Delroy Christian, I

12

would think they would have a stronger point.

13

Vena Henry testified that, I saw him in the company of Delroy

14

Christian; he was in my house; that he had a mask and he had a

15

gun.

16

But, in fact,

Also, that was Vena Henry's testimony, but in

17

opening statement, the government had also informed the jury

18

that, in fact, he had been tried for robbery in connection

19

with that.

20

he had been found — or that he had been tried for robbery, in

21

connection with the Vena Henry incident.

22

And the trial judge twice instructed the jury that

So the jury was clearly made aware that this wasn't

23

just a situation where Mr. Dowling had been seen in the

24

company of Miss -- of Delroy Christian by Vena Henry and he

25

happened to have a mask and a gun; they were clearly aware of

1

what the circumstances were through the state — through the

2

proffers made — or the statements made by the government in

3

opening statement and through the trial judge's own

4

instructions.
QUESTION:

5

Well, if the evidence of the — the gun,

6

the mask and accompanying Christian just happens to be in the

7

occurrence of what might have been a crime, that doesn't seem

8

to me to exclude it, unless the 403 balancing rule comes into

9

play, of prejudice exceeding the probative value of the

10
11

testimony.

But, that's not the argument here.
MR. TUCKER:

You're raising just the 404(b) analysis

12

as to whether the evidence should come in just by mere

13

application of that rule.

14

basically -- and — and, as I say, as an alternative ruling,

15

that it didn't comply with rule 404(b)'s relevance provisions,

16

and they also factored in the acquittal in that process

17

themselves.

18

The Third Circuit held that,

We — we feel like the basic problem was not so much

19

-- although we agree with the Third Circuit's alternative

20

ruling, but the basic problem was the fact of the

21

constitutional problems presented by the fact that a prior

22

jury heard Vena Henry's evidence and said no, not guilty.

23

that raises --

Christian, not that he didn't have a mask, not that he didn't

have a gun.

QUESTION:

This point, in other words, goes not just

to 404(b), but it also goes to the constitutional point,

doesn't it?
MR. TUCKER:

QUESTION:

MR. TUCKER:

10

It goes to the collateral estoppel

— as to whether or not the — the

issue of identity had previously been determined by the —

MR. TUCKER:

clear in that regard, because we don't have a transcript of

the first trial.

of identity was seriously contested.

18

other indications that at least cast some doubt as to what the

basis of that verdict was.

So, we — and we have a statement of the

And we — we have some

And I'd like to make a couple of points in regard to

20
21

that.

22

I would suggest that the government should bear the burden of

23

convincing this court that the issue of identity had, in fact,

24

not been decided in the first trial.

25

First, as to who really bears the burden on this.

And

1

QUESTION:

Don't you have to show us that the burden

2

of proof at that trial was the same as the government is

3

required to show — get something admit -- admitted under the

4

rules of evidence?

5

MR. TUCKER:

Well, I — I — you know, very

6

candidly, Mr. Chief Justice, I would admit, I think that's the

7

government's strongest argument, that there was a different

8

burden of proof.

9

flaws, though.

I think that argument suffers from several
Clearly the acquittal, when viewed in a very

10

technical sense, merely signifies that there was a reasonable

11

doubt, while the standard which the government had to bear to

12

admit the other crime's evidence pursuant to the Huddleston

13

decision would be a preponderance.

14

And clearly this court in -- in the civil forfeiture

15

and penalty cases, which it has decided following acquittals,

16

where it has basically said that the mere fact of an acquittal

17

does not bar a subsequent civil forfeiture proceeding, has

18

alluded to the burden of proof being different in the two

19

proceedings.

20

But I suggest that there — the burden of proof

21

argument has several problems.

For — as far as the

22

forfeiture cases, we would submit that we're really talking

23

about a very different interest involved here.

24

we're talking about a subsequent criminal prosecution here

25

where the court, on numerous occasions, in its course, has

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

Of course,

1

recognized that a defendant's interest in a criminal case is

2

much stronger than the defendant's interest in a civil case.

3

The — also the language of Ashe v. Swenson, itself,

4

the court, in more or less rejecting a burden of proof

5

argument, quoted from United States v. Kramer as a rule of

6

federal law, it's much too late to suggest that this

7

principle, referring to collateral estoppel, is not fully

8

applicable to a former judgement in a criminal case, either

9

because of the lack of mutuality or because the judgement may

10

reflect only a belief that the government is not meant to

11

higher — standard approve a higher burden of proof exacted in

12

such a case for the government --

13

QUESTION:

But — but in — in Ashe, the court was

14

dealing with -- with two successive criminal prosecutions,

15

where the burden was the same.

16

MR. TUCKER:

That is true.

That is true.

And the

17

court -- but the — the court utilized this language, of

18

course, the burden of proof.

19

the same burden of proof, but I suggest that the — this

20

language indicates that Ashe did not turn on the mere fact

21

that the burden of proof was the — was the same.

22

There's no question that it was

Because Ashe also clearly utilizes other language

23

that we see in many of these cases, that the defendant should

24

not be required to run the gauntlet, so to speak, again, and

25

he clearly has to run the gauntlet again.

QUESTION:

Well, but, you know that's language that

2

was used by the court in explaining an amendment.

3

the amendment itself.

4

provision of the double jeopardy clause, and you're —you're

5

invoking a collateral estoppel doctrine.

6

that traditionally collateral estoppel was not applicable

7

where the burden of proof in the second proceeding is less

8

than the burden of proof was in the first proceeding.

9

MR. TUCKER:

It's not

And what — what you're dealing with, a

And I — I thought

I don't — I think, as far as when

10

applying it in the civil context, that's true.

The

11

restatement of judgement alludes to that.

12

the entrants -- interests are very different in -- when

13

applied in the criminal context, especially when collateral

14

estoppel is considered a part of double jeopardy.

But I suggest that

15

In this court's cases, I would submit to the court,

16

in interpreting the double jeopardy clause, have never really

17

been very — taken a real technical approach.

18

Justice, I recall, in your opinion for the court in Illinois

19

v. Somerville, referring to the fact that — that the double

20

jeopardy clause is not interpreted, I think, in a "mechanical,

21

rigid manner."

22

court's similar decision in double jeopardy of the Perez case,

23

a very -- Justice Storey's manifest necessity test was

24

adopted, but a very technical approach would -- would reach a

25

different result.

I — Mr. Chief

That follows as far back as this court --

You couldn't even be retried, even though

2

you had obtained a reversal of your conviction.
And I think the — looking at the court's double

3

jeopardy cases, we see — see this language — or these

4

results all through the line of cases, where the court

5

basically reached — interprets the double jeopardy clause in

6

terms of what its purposes really are, and reach a — reaches

7

a result based on fairness.

8
9

The — the mistrial at the defendant's request in
Arizona v. Washington, the court recognized that really that -

10

- that there was no manifest necessity for that, but

11

nonetheless, fairness dictated a result against the defendant

12

in that case because he — he had initiated — or the mistrial

13

had been as a result of his own conduct, his own improper

14

opening statement.

15

clause, leads to a different result.

16

And so fairness, in interpreting that

QUESTION:

From what you say, it sounds as thought

17

double jeopardy is almost subsumed under due process; kind of

18

a general fairness requirement.

19

MR. TUCKER:

Well, I think, clearly, there are

20

distinctions, but I also think we have raised the due process

21

issue in this case, too.

22

become closely allied, I guess.

23

and looking at the cases -- and I want to emphasize this,

24

because the burden of proof argument, I think, as far as the

25

collateral estoppel, is, of course, our most difficult hurdle.

And, at times, they -- they tend to

2

May — may I ask you a question, Mr.

Tucker —

3

MR. TUCKER:

4

QUESTION:

Sure.
-- about the collateral estoppel?

When -

5

- when you were asked before about whether the identity issue

6

was foreclosed by collateral estoppel, you said there were two

7

problems with that, and one of them was that the burden should

8

be on the government to show that the issue was not raised;

9

and you had a second point you were going to make and you

10

never made it.

Do you know what it was?

MR. TUCKER:

Stevens.

1

that the — the record does not — isn't sufficient to say you

2

carry your burden on that?

3

Do I make myself clear?

4

MR. TUCKER:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
Yeah.

Maybe there's a lot of stuff out

6

there that if you had a retrial you could do that, but I don't

7

think in the present state of the record we can really tell

8

whether — whether the jury verdict in that case determined

9

that your client was not the person who went to that woman's

11
12

house.
MR. TUCKER:

I think -- I think a fair answer to

that question is, indeed, the record is not clear either way.

QUESTION:

14

MR. TUCKER:

Yeah.
That's why we would like you to put

that burden on the government.

response to your question, I agree — I think I agree

2

basically that since there's no transcript and it's not clear

3

enough either way, I would suggest that if -- if the court

extends and -- and agrees with us that the principles of Ashe

v. Swenson apply, and collateral estoppel applies, that

6

perhaps a remand would be appropriate for that determination.

9

But there are some other indications that identity
was the issue.

For instance, the defendant testified in this

10

trial, Mr. Dowling testified, and he testified he did not rob

11

Vena Henry.

12

Now, had he made any sort of admission of the fact

13

that he had been in Vena Henry's house in the first trial, I

14

suggest that the government would have impeached him with

15

that.

16

to that effect, he could have been impeached by that also.

17

And we see nothing -- that he was not challenged on that

18

basis.

19

And, indeed, had his counsel made any sort of admission

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure you would have

impeached him on that.

that he was there wearing a mask and carrying a gun.

He said he

Vena Henry's house.
Also I would suggest that the government — the

4

theory that the government is putting forth and put forth at

5

the trial here when this issue arose, that -- in fact, the

6

defense was that perhaps they had just come to the house

7

seeking to get some money that was owed them, is not — would

8

not — that theory violates Ashe's language that this court

9

should look at — in attempting to — or to — or any court,

10

in attempting to reconstruct the basis of an acquittal, should

11

in fact not apply a hypertechnical rule and look — and look

12

at it with reason and rationality.

13

The assistant United States attorney, when

14

addressing the issue, told the court the two of them merely

15

came to retrieve, from an individual in the house, money.

QUESTION:

I

Well, it would be kind of odd to come in

a mask and a gun, wouldn't it?

19

MR. TUCKER:

I suggest that -- that the government's

20

theory that the jury acquitted on the basis that two

21

individuals came with a mask and a gun and a shot was fired in

22

the ceiling, and that was proffered and — by the government

23

lawyer and argued in the admissability of the evidence,

24

clearly defies ration and reason.

25

And I would also point out to the court that the —

1

the defendant was not only acquitted of robbery, he was

2

acquitted in the Vena Henry case of burglary; he was acquitted

3

of assault; and perhaps most importantly of all, he was

4

acquitted of weapons violations, where he was charged with

5

possession of a weapon during a commission of a felony, and he

6

was acquitted of the lesser-included offense of possession of

7

a firearm.

8

9

Now, had the jury even decided on this basis that
the government conjures up for us, they still would have had

10

to have found he possessed the -- the firearm.

11

acquitted him on that basis, too.

12

And they

So I suggest — and also in the record there is --

13

in the volume of September 23rd and September 24th, at page 60

14

and 61, there is evidence to the effect, when the United

15

States — the assistant U.S. attorney was arguing concerning

16

the admissability of the piece of evidence, that the defendant

17

had denied his involvement in the Vena Henry case when he had

18

first been arrested in connection with that, and that denial

19

had been introduced in the first trial.

20

So, when you couple that with his denial in this

21

trial, the lack of impeachment, and when you factor in the

22

Ashe's injunction that a reviewing court, in attempting to

23

reconstruct the basis of the verdict, should not leave its

24

common sense at home, that I suggest to you that perhaps maybe

25

we even have carried the burden.

And if we haven't, if the court puts that burden on
us, then we would suggest a remand.
If I could just address one other matter in regard

4

to the burden.

5

who -- who bears the burden, but the lower courts, as the

6

government cites in their brief, pretty much assume that

7

burden should be on the party opposing the admissability of

8

the evidence.

9

The lower court — Ashe doesn't really tell us

I suggest that that doctrine perhaps conflicts with

10

prior decisions of this court, too, especially the line of

11

cases, and I believe it begins with the Fung Foo case, that

12

basically say, if a jury finds an acquittal, even if it's on a

13

total — or I think Fung Foo involved a judge entering a

14

judgement of acquittal -- on a totally erroneous basis, and

15

the reviewing court can see that the judge should not have

16

entered a judgement of acquittal, nonetheless, that's the end

17

of the matter.

18

Now, what that says is that the risk of — of an

19

acquittal on a improper basis, the Constitution puts that risk

20

on the government.

21

principle would have put the burden the government here,

22

because the risk of a reviewing court wrongfully deciding what

23

the basis of that acquittal was, should rest on the

24

government.

be correct, but certainly the court has, at times, indicated

that a not guilty verdict, at least functionally, the system

12

really requires that that be treated as innocence.

13

QUESTION:

That -- that -- that's just inconsistent

14

with our cases that say that it's not — you know, you're not

precluded from bringing a civil penalty action on the basis of

1

allegiance to the Union, and he was from Arkansas, and when

2

Arkansas seceded, he had gone with Arkansas, and then he

3

wanted to come back before this court and practice, and

4

Congress had passed an act saying he couldn't practice, I

5

believe, unless you took this oath that you had never,

6

essentially, been against the Union.

7

And he argued that he had indeed, as I think

8

President Lincoln had given him a pardon.

And that issue came

9

before the court, and the court said a pardon reaches the

10

punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the

11

offender, and when the pardon is full, it releases the

12

punishment and blocks out the existence of guilt, so that in

13

the eye of the law, the offender is as innocent as if he had

14

never committed the offense.

15

Now I would suggest that if a pardon is treated in

16

that manner, where a jury or — and

situation there, but if a — if a pardon is treated as

innocence, where a jury has returned a guilty verdict,

21

far, at least functionally, to treat that as innocent, at

least in the context of not having to be retried again in a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L. NIGHTINGALE

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

9

Our essential position is that the reasoning of two

10

of this court's decisions require the conclusion that Mrs.

11

Henry's testimony was admissible, notwithstanding the prior

12

acquittal.

13

First, in Huddleston v. United States, the court

14

confirmed what the rules provide.

15

evidence in federal cases is governed by a standard of proof

16

that is effectively the same one that a trial judge employs

17

when it determines whether to send a case to a jury in a civil

18

case.

19

The admissability of

Evidence is admissable if the facts on which its

20

relevance depends are supported by proof sufficient to support

21

their being found by a preponderance of the evidence.

22

23
24
25

And that is the standard that applied to the
admissability of Mrs. Henry's testimony in this case.
Second, in United States v. Eighty-Nine Firearms,
the court held that for purposes of collateral estoppel, a

1

judgement of acquittal in a criminal case establishes only the

2

existence of reasonable doubt on whatever issues are decisive.

3

Such a judgement does not, therefore, foreclose

4

relitigation of those issues in a proceeding in which they are

5

subject to a lower standard of proof.

6

that Mr. Dowling's acquittal did not foreclose the trial judge

7

in this case from making the finding necessary to admit her

8

testimony.

9

It follows, we believe,

In view of the questions that came up about the

10

applicability of the rules of evidence to this situation, it

11

may be helpful to review that aspect of the case briefly.

12

First, there is a general rule, perhaps the most important of

13

the federal rules of evidence, which is that all relevant

14

evidence is presumptively admissable.

15

That rule appears to reflect the assumption, which

16

experience suggests is well-founded, that the best guarantee

17

of reliable outcomes in any trial is to permit both parties to

18

marshal whatever evidence they can that tends to make the

19

facts in issue more or less likely, and to offer that evidence

20

to the jury.

21

Second, under the rules, judgements are, with a very

22

few specified exceptions, hearsay, completely inadmissible in

23

evidence.

24

Again, the assumption appears to be that when a matter that

25

has been the subject of a prior judgement is an issue in a

Those exceptions are — are inapplicable here.

second trial, those exceptions are inapplicable.

2

to be resolved by allowing the trier in the second case the

3

same opportunity to see all of the evidence that's available,

4

as was available to the trier in the first case.

5

The issue is

Each jury is then free to draw its own conclusions

6

about the weight and probative value of that evidence,

7

depending on the issues in dispute and the other evidence that

8

is available.

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Nightingale, the Third Circuit

thought the evidence was not admissable under the rule.

11

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And our position

12

is that when one reviews their rationale, it appears that they

13

accorded the judgement the same effect, in terms of the rules

14

of evidence that they had concluded, with respect to

15

collateral estoppel.

16

I forget their precise language, but, in effect, it

17

was, that if a jury has determined a fact in a prior

18

proceeding, a second jury should not be allowed to find that

19

fact in a second proceeding.

20

collateral estoppel reframed, in terms of the rules of

21

evidence.

22

And that, in effect, is

We believe that there was a mistake made in all of

23

the court of appeals holdings, which was to assign too much

24

effect to the judgement.

1

the misapplication of the rule of Ashe v. Swenson, or is there

2

some new proposition presented here?

3

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

The Third Circuit has not relied

4

on Ashe v. Swenson.

5

Swenson to the situation in which the fact is essential to

6

both prosecutions.

7

federal common law, I suppose, the collateral estoppel extends

8

in addition to this case.

9

The Third Circuit has limited Ashe v.

It has concluded that, as a matter of

So that we believe that the Third Circuit misapplied

10

the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and that it would be

11

unwarranted a fortiori to extend to Ashe v. Swenson to this

12

situation.

13

If the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not

14

reach it as a matter of common law, Ashe v. Swenson, which

15

held that collateral estoppel was embodied in the double

16

jeopardy clause on those facts, cannot possibly be extended to

17

this case.

Now, he

1

matter what identity evidence came up at the trial?

2

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

That's correct.

That is the

3

effect of an acquittal in a criminal case; one cannot be

4

retried for the same offense in double jeopardy terms.

5

Ashe v. Swenson, which is, in effect, a subspecies of double

6

jeopardy claims, provides that it is deemed the same offense

7

when the same fact is essential to the -- to convictions and

8

subsequent prosecutions.

9

And

It's that reason that we — it's that understanding

10

of Ashe that leads us to the conclusion that the case cannot

11

fairly be extended to this situation.

12

all, is a decision that applies the double jeopardy clause.

13

That constitutional provision prohibits putting a defendant

14

twice in jeopardy for the same offense.

15

Ashe v. Swenson, after

In Ashe, because the same fact was essential to both

16

convictions, to the — to both offenses -- the court found

that there was, in effect, the same effect — the same offense

involved in both cases.

19

explained by Justice Powell in his footnote 6 in Brown v.

Ohio.

21

And that's the way the case is

He explains Ashe v. Swenson as a situation in which

22

there is a particular test applicable to determine whether two

23

offenses are the same for purposes of double jeopardy.

Now that's a characterization that can't possibly
apply to this case.

convictions, it can't be relitigated.

Ashe v. Swenson can't be reconciled with the

language of the double jeopardy clause in one — unless one

5

believes that in some sense the same offense is involved.

QUESTION:

Well, I'm just asking, is it your

7

position that the subsequent prosecution in the case that I

8

put would be barred by Ashe v. Swenson?

9
10

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Yes.

Now, perhaps it would be helpful to walk through

11

briefly the way this issue — the evidence was presented in

12

the district court, because I believe it illustrates the very

13

close parallel between the situation that faced the trial

14

court in this case, and the situation that faced the court in

15

the second proceeding in Eighty-Nine Firearms.

16

The theory on which this evidence was offered in

17

this case was that it tended to tie together a line of

18

circumstantial proof.

19

the jury to accept was that Mr. Dowling had borrowed a white

20

Volkswagen the day before the robbery and had planned to make

21

his escape in the same Volkswagen after robbing the bank.

22

The inference that the prosecutor asked

There was evidence that the -- there was a white

23

Volkswagen in the vicinity of the bank at near the time of the

24

bank robbery.

identified.

And one of the individuals in the car was

18

something a little unfair about this man having gone to trial

19

on that issue and having won in that case, and saying, well,

we're going to use that same evidence all over again to try

21

and prove precisely what we failed to prove before?

We would suggest to the court that the approach

advocated by the government here in its argument, and indeed

What the government is saying to the court is, treat the

just treat this as whether or not

it's relevant evidence.

11

And, in fact, the government even tells us, don't

protected by double jeopardy protection, and those same

concerns are very much present here.

Here, we suggest that, indeed, a defendant who has

expectation of finality.

the two consecutive sentences were thrown out.

Now, also the concerns that the court -- that double

8

jeopardy protects against repetitive and harassing lawsuits

9

are indeed applicable here.

For instance, suppose a defendant

10

who has been acquitted and he — and he is suspected -- or the

11

government is thinking about charging him in what otherwise

12

would be a very marginal second prosecution, as indeed was the

13

case here, this was — this evidence was first introduced in

14

the third trial, and the prosecutor even proffered to the

15

court, we need this evidence — now, what this means is that a

16

defendant is subject to repetitive lawsuits based on the fact

17

that he had been acquitted because of -- is that acquitted

18

conduct evidence that may indeed be the piece of evidence that

19

not only convicts him in the new trial, but, in fact,

20

motivates the government to press forward with the new trial.

21

Also, we have the concerns that are equally present

22

here of double jeopardy prevents the government from utilizing

23

the first trial as a dry run.

24

of concerns here.

25

from its acquittal in the Vena Henry case.

Well, we have those same sorts

They pare —

obviously pared down their evidence.

2

All of these concerns are equally present.

3

Now, the government cites the Standefer case and the

4

language in Standefer which the court says, well, perhaps we

5

should take a cautious approach to extending collateral

6

estoppel to criminal cases.

7

However, Standefer is entirely distinguishable based

8

on these very same concerns.

Because in Standefer, the

defendant was claiming, don't prosecute me based on collateral

estoppel on an aiding and abetting theory because defendant

11

number two has been tried as the principal and acquitted.
Well, it follows that double jeopardy concerns are

13

not quite as strong there because that defendant had indeed
