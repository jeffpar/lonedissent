ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. BRYSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves the federal wiretapping

12

statute, and in particular, the provision of that statute

13

that deals with the requirement that at the termination of

14

interceptions or extensions thereof, a judge must seal the

15

wiretap -- the products of the wiretap or oral

16

interceptions.

17

just as a shorthand to cover both wiretaps and oral

18

interceptions.

19

I'll use the term "wiretap," if I may,

The case arose from a lengthy 16-month wiretap

20

investigation in Puerto Rico, where a total of about a

21

thousand, somewhat in excess of a thousand, tapes were

22

generated in the course of the investigation.

23

prosecution was initiated in Connecticut, the defendants

24

moved to suppress the wiretap evidence on a large number

25

of grounds.

When the

The district court denied the vast bulk of those

1
2

grounds, but granted the suppression motion in part with

3

respect to two groups of tapes on one ground.

4

ground was that the tapes with -- those two sets of tapes

5

had not been sealed quickly enough after the termination

6

of the interceptions and the extensions, as the district

7

court construed the term "extensions," and that,

8

therefore, those tapes had to be suppressed under Section

9

2518(8)(a) of the wiretap statute.
QUESTION:

10
11

MR. BRYSON:

13

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Bryson, the offense occurred in

1983?

12

14

And that

That's right, Your Honor.
And has the defendant ever been

brought to trial?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, a number of the defendants

16

have been brought to trial.

17

Court here are the ones that were severed out at the time

18

of the -- or following the loss of the evidence from

19

suppression because these were the defendants as to whom

20

that evidence was deemed to be essential.

21

The ones who are before the

There were a number of other defendants who have

22

already been tried and most of them have been convicted.

23

One was acquitted.

24
25

QUESTION:

But, at least, Mr. Ojeda Rios has

never been tried?

MR. BRYSON:

1
2

That's right.

That's right.

He —

he remains at large -QUESTION:

3

And you — you take the position that

4

the Speedy Trial Act does not preclude trial at this

5

junction?
MR. BRYSON:

6

Oh, that's right, Your Honor,

7

because we have -- there has been ongoing litigation on

8

this issue ever since.

9

which nothing was going on.

10

There's never been a point in
In fact, this case has had an

enormous amount of activity all the way through.
QUESTION:

11

The statutory provision under which

12

the exclusion was made says basically that the presence of

13

the seal --

14

MR. BRYSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's right.
-- provided for by this subsection.

That's the language used.

17

MR. BRYSON:

18

QUESTION:

That's right.
Doesn't that phrase have the effect

19

of incorporating the timing requirement provided for in

20

this subsection?

21
22

MR. BRYSON:

We don't think so, Your Honor.

Let

me move to that argument.

23

QUESTION:

It certainly could be said to do so.

24

I mean, I am concerned with the language of the provision

25

itself.

MR. BRYSON:

1

As are we, and it could be said to

2

-- to do so, and the Second Circuit, the First Circuit and

3

the D.C. Circuit have concluded that that is the proper

4

reading of the statute.

5

We think it's a very unnatural reading of the

6

statute which isn't supported either by the plain language

7

of the statute, by its legislative history or really by

8

the purposes of the statute.

9

I may, right now.

And let me turn to that, if

The language, as you say, is the presence of the

10
11

seal provided for by this subsection.

12

means the judicial seal, the seal that a judge must put on

13

the tapes at the time that the tapes are -- are sealed.

14

Now, the — it then says, or a satisfactory explanation

15

for the absence thereof.

QUESTION:

17

18

didn't have one.

19

MR. BRYSON:

20

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

22

Our view is that

Now, the purpose --

Do we have a judicial seal?

I never

Do we get issued these things?

I

No, Your Honor --

Just district judges have them maybe,

huh?

23

MR. BRYSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

know, you could put a red —

District judges are -I always wanted one, you know.

QUESTION:

5

MR. BRYSON:

It -- this is I think -- it may not

Yeah.
— but it certainly is unusual to

6

have courts involved in sealing evidence.

7

it's the same thing as the seal that any one uses in the

8

— in the context of establishing chain of custody.

But basically

You put your
So, it's nothing

The judge can vary the

Now, if Congress had met -- Congress is using

15

the words presence and absence of the seal.

Now, presence

16

and absence suggests that if you look for it and you say

17

it's absent, nothing's there.

18

the defendants are making is that, well, this — what's

19

absent is a timely imposed seal, a timely affixed seal,

20

which is a very awkward way to put the point,

In fact, the argument that

Congress, if they had wanted to deal with both

21
22

delay and absence, could have easily said a seal not

23

timely affixed -- or delay or absence.

for, it demonstrates, I think, how strange the language is

2

to -- to import so much -- to put so much weight on the

3

phrase "provided for by this subsection."

4
5

QUESTION:

remedy for an unexcused delay in sealing?
MR. BRYSON:

6

7

Well, in your view, there would be no

Well, certainly Section 2518(a) —

(8)(a) would not provide an exclusionary principle.

8

That's right.

Now, of course, delays in sealing can

9

result in making the burden of authentication more

10

difficult if in fact, as in this case, the claim is made

11

that there was tampering with the tapes and the government

12

has to come in and rebut by clear and convincing evidence

13

any claim of tampering.

14

QUESTION:

That's what we did.

Well, Congress may have intended some

15

kind of prophylactic remedy here in the sense that if a --

16

if a seal is provided immediately, you're just going to

17

eliminate the risk of much tampering.

18

MR. BRYSON:

There is no doubt that they

19

intended the immediate sealing to do exactly that, Your

20

Honor.

21

is clear from the legislative history — they said, we

22

want to avoid arguments on this point, we want you to seal

23

it immediately.

24
25

They have -- they had a ruling that the evidence

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Bryson, I assume that if you --

12

if you don't do it right away, the district judge -- you

13

run the risk of the district judge saying, I'm sorry it's

14

too late.

MR. BRYSON:

MR. BRYSON:

The parade of horribles that defendants -QUESTION:

So it's entirely up to the judge to

MR. BRYSON:

Well, under 2518(8)(a) that's —

that's -- that's true.

— our position would be the

Well, if the judge is willing to

seal it under those circumstances —

You didn't get the seal on these;

QUESTION:

Now, it may be --

Well, also under the other -- it

doesn't violate the other section.
MR. BRYSON:

19

No.

But it would have to -- we

20

would nonetheless still have to establish the authenticity

21

QUESTION:

Well, maybe the judge says, well, I

don't think the government agents aren't going to use

phoney evidence.

I don't even have to look at this.

QUESTION:

Well, it would comply with statute.

It would comply with the statute under your reading.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, that's right.

But we would

7

still have to establish authenticity under the Federal

8

rules and under the rules set forth by the courts with

9

respect to tape-recorded evidence, which is a -- a

10

significant burden.

provision would not bar --

14

QUESTION:

It's just that this particular

This particular provision would be

totally meaningless.
MR. BRYSON:

wouldn't apply to that set of facts.

It would not impose any burden at all

if the judge was willing to seal it.

MR. BRYSON:

Yeah.
That's right.

That -- we would

he doesn't have to hold you in contempt.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, that may be, although it's

not clear that -QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question.

How

7

does someone challenging authenticity go about proving it?

8

I mean, say you have custody of tape for three or four

9

months and you get somebody on the witness stand that

10

says, I don't know anything that ever happened, it was

11

sitting in the drawer all the time.

12

challenge that testimony?

13
14

MR. BRYSON:

How can anybody ever

How -- how can they challenge the

authenticity of the tapes?

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BRYSON:

Yeah.
Well, they -- they made the

17

statements on the tapes.

18

on that tape that I never said, I have no involvement with

19

this robbery, I never said anything about Wells Fargo, I'm

20

a complete stranger to this thing, and there's my voice

21

saying in a spliced form that I did this.

22

If they say, you have got stuff

I'm going to challenge that, number one, by

23

showing that there is no valid chain of custody and,

24

number two, I'm going to bring my expert in and I'm going

25

show that those words were stuck together like the pieces

cut out of the newspaper in effect and stuck on the tape.
That's the way it happens.

2

The person whose

3

voice is intercepted is in a good position to know if he

4

said those things.

And --

QUESTION:

5

And that same -- that same process

6

would -- would transpire whether it was sealed or not,

7

presumably.

8

MR. BRYSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's right.
I mean, you could make the same

argument.
MR. BRYSON:

11

That's right.

That's right.

The

12

seal is an aid in that it establishes a better chain of

13

custody than if there was no seal.

14

the reason that it is really welcome to the government, is

15

something the government has an incentive to put on -- is

16

that it takes care of everything from the moment that seal

17

is — is put on, when the judge puts it on, to the moment

18

of trial.

19

What it does is -- and

Because when the judge rips the seal off and

20

it's still intact, assuming somebody hasn't really gone

21

wild and gone out and gotten the seal off, steamed it off

22

or something and replaced it — you always take that risk.

23

But basically you have a very solid chain of custody.

24
25

QUESTION:

As a practical matter, once the tapes

have been sealed and the government wants to have access

1

to them to prepare for trial, what do they do, make

2

copies?
MR. BRYSON:

3

Well, they generally will have made

4

copies in advance and they will be working from the

5

copies.

Or if they haven't, they can go to the court -QUESTION:

6

7

submitting it to seal?
MR. BRYSON:

8

9

So you make a copy in advance of

Oh, yes, that's — that's not

infrequent and the courts have approved that -- that

10

procedure.

11

there have been delays which have been accepted as

12

satisfactory or explained delays based on the time taken

13

to make copies.

14

Now — and in fact, in some courts there --

The court can -- the government can also go back

15

to the district court, as the statute specifically

16

provides, and ask for an order unsealing for a specific

17

purpose and resealing so that there isn't any strict

18

prohibition against going back and getting the tapes.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

But even if the tape is sealed, the

government has to authenticate it, doesn't it?
MR. BRYSON:

Oh, sure.

22

an easier process, of course.

23

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

It's just

When you referred a moment ago to the

provided in the rules?

MR. BRYSON:

1

No.

No.

That has — has developed

2

in the courts of appeals and in the Second Circuit as a

3

specific rule applicable to tape-recorded evidence.
QUESTION:

4
5
6

What's -- what's the basis for that

rule?
MR. BRYSON:

There isn't any basis in the rule,

7

Your Honor.

8

that tape-recorded evidence is hard to -- it's hard to

9

tell whether it's authentic or not and, therefore, we're

10
11

What it is -- it's simply -- the rationale is

going to put on the government a particularly high burden.
It's really created as a sort of common law

12

evidentiary rule.

13

question of whether Rule 901 compels that, I think

14

probably not.

15

followed by -- by courts of appeals.

16

Now, if push came to shove, the

But that certainly is the rule that's

QUESTION:

Does that just go to the explanation

17

for the absence of the seal or with respect to

18

authenticity?

MR. BRYSON:

QUESTION:

23
24
25

With respect to authenticity.
Only?
Well, that's right.

That's right.

Doesn't -- doesn't Rule 901 provide

the way things shall be authenticated?
MR. BRYSON:

Yes, it does, and -- and I think

the better argument -- I think those courts of appeals

1

that have held clear and convincing evidence as a

2

requirement may well be wrong, and that's not the issue

3

before the Court.

4

In this case, the district court, following

5

established Second Circuit precedent, found the tapes in

6

question -- or at least the tapes that he addressed -- he

7

didn't address all of the tapes -- but the ones he did

8

address, he found to be genuine by clear and convincing

9

evidence following Second Circuit precedent.
Now, you — you could look at the legislative

10
11

history as well and find that while it's not dispositive

12

-- this is not legislative history that simply solves the

13

problem if it ever does -- but the legislative history is,

14

I think, instructive in that it -- it -- there is no

15

reference, no suggestion that the Congress was trying to

16

deal not only with the absence of a seal but also with

17

delays in sealing.

MR. BRYSON:

Yes.
Okay, well —

In this case — let me just run

8

through what -- what we have.

The statute really had its

9

origin in the task force report on organized crime in 1970

10

-- '67 of President Johnson's Commission on Law

11

Enforcement and the Administration of Justice.
There was a draft statute in the appendix of

12

13

that report which turns out to be very close to what

14

ultimately became Title III.

15

provision that we're dealing -- or the provision we're

16

dealing with here was almost exactly word for word the

17

draft provision that showed up in that report.

And in particular, the draft

18

And the language used to describe that draft

19

provision was -- at page 103 of the report -- was that

20

after saying that the seals — the tapes should be sealed

21

when the interception is terminated, "The seals should be

Again, in the Senate report, we have,

"The

2

presence of the seal, noted above, the judicial seal, is

3

intended to be a prerequisite for use unless a

4

satisfactory explanation can be made to the judge."
Then in a statement on -- that was put into the

5
6

record prior to the enactment of Title III by Senator

7

Scott, a shorthand description of the provisions of the

8

bill said, "Unless under seal or no satisfactory

explanation of its absence, the information contained in

such recording may not be used."
Not only is there no hint of delay, but we're

talking about unless the seal is there.

think would show up if they really were focusing on that

It's not clear what it

You could interpret it to mean simply that an

10

accurate description, a description that satisfies the

11

court that this is an accurate description of what

12

happened even if the — what happened was that the tapes

13

got tampered with.

14

But we think it requires more than that.

In

15

light of the purpose of the statute, we think that what it

requires is that you explain to the satisfaction of the

judge, that you -- that the tapes have not been, in fact,

18

tampered with, that they are pristine.

MR. REEVE:

Yes, Your Honor, and I'd like to

address that.

that can reasonably be asked in construing this statute.

And I think that there are three questions

Number one, what did Congress say?

Number two,

5

what did Congress not say?

Congress know how to create a prejudice test in a rule of

7

exclusion if they desired to do so?

8

question that you raised.

And, number three, did

seal provided for by this subsection is an immediate seal.

2

It's not a seal the day before the tapes are sought to be

admitted.

It's an immediate seal.
Congress could have said it differently, but

4
5

they did not.

And Justice Scalia inquired of my brother

6

counsel as to whether or not, if the tapes were submitted

7

to a district court judge the day before the government

8

sought to admit that evidence, would that judge -- might

9

that judge refuse to seal those tapes.
My suggestion is when you look at the statutory

10
11

language there is no authority on the part of a district

12

court judge to do that and the government would argue

13

precisely that before a district court.

14

What the statute says is the recording shall

15

first be made available to the judge issuing such order

16

and, two, sealed under his direction.

17

mandatory term of that sentence clearly applies to both

make that argument.
That's not a central issue, I don't believe, to

the proper interpretation of this section because the

reality is that — I believe and in our view -- the

language is plain, and Congress put that language

If there was any question that Congress did not

create a prejudice test in this section, one need only

6

satisfactory explanation requirement of the section we're

7

talking about play under your analysis of the seal

8

requirement?

9

MR. REEVE:

Your Honor, the satisfactory

10

explanation plays a critical component.

If the government

11

fails to immediately seal the tapes and the courts have

12

pretty uniformly held immediate as within one or two

13

working days of the court, then the government bears the

14

burden of coming before the district court and

15

establishing a satisfactory explanation.
That, I would suggest to the Court is something

16
17

more than negligence, it's something more than a gross

18

misreading of the statute, and the court looks at it and

19

considers a number of questions.
QUESTION:

20
21

Is the -- is the failure excusable?

Is that what you're asking?

22

MR. REEVE:

Yes, in effect that's right, Your

23

Honor.

And the courts — the Second Circuit and the D.C.

24

Circuit Court of Appeals and the First Circuit look at a

25

number of factors.

But for purposes of this case -So it just wasn't really a good faith

and excusable mistake of law, is that right?
MR. REEVE:

It was not, Your Honor, and the

13

reason is this.

The prosecutor here decided, even in

14

light and in the face of the statutory requirement of

15

immediate sealing, in light of a memo that he had from the

16

Justice Department that said, if you don't immediately

17

seal, you risk suppression.

18

-- he admitted he hadn't read the case law before he made

19

this decision -- without looking at a treatise that he had

20

on his desk that said -- specifically rejected his theory

21

and he was asked at the district court --

Well, what -- what -- theory of what?
His theory that when you have one

big wiretap investigation, you don't have to seal until

He was asked, under your theory, there is no -- arguably
no limit to how far out that's going to take.

It was an unlimited, if you will, venture, way,

legislative history and they include the following.

Number one, Congress intended to create immediate direct

judicial supervision over wiretap evidence.

MR. REEVE:

For what purpose?

MR. REEVE:

Absolutely.

That's ultimate

20

that ultimate statutory purpose, Congress decided the best

most effective way to approach that ultimate goal of the

statute is to have that judicial supervision to reduce the

It was ripe for abuse.

what the decision was — and it may not be a decision

which every single member of this Court agrees is the

right line, but they created a line — immediate sealing

upon the expiration of the orders or extensions thereof.

The

1

and so I think that that's

even if

2

you get to the question of statutory purpose in

3

legislative history, it aids our view, not the

4

government's.
There are two other points that I would like to

5
6

make.

Number one, the government's test, if adopted by

7

this Court, is going to require tampering hearings in

8

every district court, in every sealing violation,

9

regardless of whether it's a short delay where the

10

government's explanation may be very, very reasonable,

11

because what they're asking the Court to do is define

12

satisfactory explanation as no tampering.

13

Once that definition is established, in cases

14

where the test created by the Second Circuit is in fact

15

very, very helpful to the government.

16

applied has been extremely liberally — liberally applied.

17

Excuse me.

18

have tampering hearings, and experts coming in.

19

And the test

Under the government's theory, we're going to

20

that Justice O'Connor raised, which is this case has gone

courts to have those kind of hearings?

4

Finally, in conclusion, the -- the government

5

came first before this Court in its petition for

6

certiorari on page 11 and the government said in that

7

petition, this is a serious problem because despite the

8

best efforts of a supervising attorney in a wiretap case,

9

there will be occasions on which the tapes will not be

10

immediately sealed.

11

why they created a satisfactory explanation.

12

Congress agreed with that and that's

But as the delays get longer, you need a better

13

and better reason.

But the problem, and the Second

14

Circuit has adopted that approach -- it is an approach

15

which allows the best efforts of a supervising attorney.

16

What the government is effectively asking this

17

Court to do today is to rewrite the statute to avoid

18

separation of powers issues -- to avoid issues of judicial

19

restraint — all so that we can — protect the negligent,

20

sometimes willful, sloppy, intentional bad faith conduct

21

of officers of the United States Justice Department.

travel down.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. BRYSON:

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

The first point I'd like to make quickly is each

6

of the courts already requires us to show, as part of a

7

satisfactory explanation, that there was no tampering.

8

So, there's not going to be any great increase in the

9

numbers of these hearings since that's already a

10

requirement that we have to satisfy.

11

we have to do more by way of establishing a satisfactory

12

explanation for delay.

The question is do

The second point is the Gigante case, which is

out the argument that, well, you have to look at how long

the delay was, why the delay was, and that there was a

there was one legal mistake, the construction of the term

getting another order for place B, when that is an
