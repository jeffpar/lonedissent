ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIM T. BUCKLEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BUCKLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question of interpreting the

11

citizen suit provisions of the Resource Conservation and

12

Recovery Act.

13

identical in many other citizen suit provisions in other

14

federal environmental laws.

15

whether dismissal and refiling is required if there has been a

16

failure to notify the government of the violation.

17

These citizen suit provisions are virtually

This case presents the question

In this particular case, through inadvertence on my

18

part, I notified Tillamook County that it was in violation of

19

the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the operation of

20

its landfill operation.

21

County, I intended also to notify the government.

22

requires that the EPA and the Oregon Department of

23

Environmental Quality also be notified of the violation.

24

I was aware of that statute and aware of the regulation, but

25

somewhere between the execution -- the intention and the

At the time that I notified Tillamook

The statute

And

1

execution something went wrong.
Nevertheless, a year later, the citizen suit was filed

2

3

and approximately, say nine months later, Tillamook County

4

moved for summary judgment, asking the Court to dismiss the

5

case on the ground that there was lack of subject matter

6

jurisdiction because notice to the government had not been

7

given.

8

summary judgment I sent notice to the EPA and DEQ, upon

9

learning, to my surprise, that I had not done so; in fact, I

10

thought I had done so and was very surprised to learn that I

11

hadn't.

12

Immediately after having received the motion for

The case came on for hearing approximately 50 days

13

after the motion was filed, and about 50 days after I sent a

14

notice to the EPA and the Oregon Department of Environmental

15

Quality.

16

thought it would be a waste of judicial resources, given the

17

fact that the EPA and the Oregon Department of Environmental

18

Quality had not indicated either any objection or that they

19

intended to do anything.

20
21

And, at that time, the District Court said that he

QUESTION:

Mr. Buckley, you say the case came on for

hearing; this was in the District Court in Portland —

22

MR. BUCKLEY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BUCKLEY:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

What sort of a hearing?
Motion for summary judgment --

A hearing on the motion for summary judgment

1

filed by your opponents?
MR. BUCKLEY:

2

Yes.

And that hearing took place

3

approximately 50 days after the motion for summary judgment

4

was filed and after I gave the formal notice required by the

5

statute, and the judge said that it would be a waste of

6

judicial resources to require dismissal at this time.

7

About two years later, and about two years after —

8

QUESTION:

9

May I ask, though, at that time, was one of

the grounds of the motion the failure to comply with the

10

notice requirement?

11

MR. BUCKLEY:

12

Yes, that was the whole ground of the

motion.

13

QUESTION:

The whole ground, yeah.

14

MR. BUCKLEY:

After the district judge essentially said

15

to me that I had done everything that was required because the

16

defect had been cured, the case went to trial about two years

17

later and an injunction was entered against Tillamook County.

18

A finding was made that it was in violation of the Resource

19

Conservation and Recovery Act standards.

20

So we are here today under this, what I consider to be

21

a fairly unusual factual situation, to determine whether or

22

not a dismissal and refiling would be necessary.

23

determine whether or not a dismissal and refiling would be

24

necessary is to take a look at the statute itself to determine

25

whether or not the statute makes giving the notice a

(800) FOR DEPO

The way to

1

jurisdictional requirement that would require dismissal and

2

refiling.
Now, of course, the first place — this obviously

3
4

presents a question of statutory interpretation and the

5

starting point, obviously, is the text of the statute.

6

text of the statute has one sentence that refers to the

7

jurisdiction of the District Court.

8

says that the District Court shall have jurisdiction to

9

enforce an order brought in a citizen suit, enforce

10

compliance.

11

District Court's jurisdiction.

The

And that one sentence

That is the one sentence that talks about the

12

The rest of the statute, the rest of the provision,

13

refers to timing requirements of the notice and timing; it

14

refers to how and who may intervene; it refers to attorney

15

fees.

16

Conservation and Recovery Act, there is also an additional

17

requirement that if the citizen is going to bring an action

18

for immediate endangerment to the health or the environment,

19

that he must serve a copy of the complaint on the Attorney

20

General and the administrator of the EPA.

And, in the most recent amendments to the Resource

t

21

So the question that we have here is, are these

22

additional requirements jurisdictional requirements —

23

QUESTION:

I wonder, Mr. Buckley, if you are quite

24

right in calling the question here, is it a jurisdictional

25

requirement.

To me a jurisdictional requirement might mean

1

that, if you had litigated this issue without it ever having

2

been, litigated you case without the question ever having been

3

raised all through the District Court, the Ninth Circuit, the

4

judgment become final, you know, could it be set aside because

5

the Court didn't have jurisdiction.

6

talking about something like that.

7

precondition to the commencement of the action.

8

that is "jurisdictional" or not, I don't know, but I wonder if

9

it is quite that stark a requirement.

10

MR. BUCKLEY:

We are not obviously
We're just talking about a
Now, whether

Well, I think it is, Your Honor, because

11

the Ninth Circuit ruled that it was a jurisdictional

12

requirement.

13

QUESTION:

I mean, we don't have to follow the

14

interpretation of the Ninth Circuit if we are not convinced of

15

its wisdom.

16

MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, I hope that the Court does not

17

follow the Ninth Circuit.

18

[Laughter]

19

QUESTION:

But I, you know, to the extent that the

20

requirement would prevent you from proceeding with your suit

21

and refiling, and still not be a jurisdictional one, that

22

analysis really doesn't help you.

23

suggested I don't think helps your case.

24
25

MR. BUCKLEY:
requirement.

I mean, the analysis I have

Well, I agree, Your Honor, that it is a

I mean, Congress indicated that giving notice to

1

the government and to the violator was a requirement, and I

2

agree that it is a requirement.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

So, how stringent is the requirement is

really what we're talking about.
MR. BUCKLEY:

I guess that's the point.

And it seems

6

to me that the best way to effectuate the intent of Congress

7

to accomplish the purpose that Congress intended is to grant

8

or recognize that the District Courts have limited

9

jurisdiction to fashion an order that will somehow serve both

10

the overlying purpose of the statute, which is to protect the

11

environment; the secondary purpose of the statute, which is to

12

encourage citizen enforcement; and the third purpose, which,

13

of course, is to try to trigger government action and to also

14

trigger voluntary compliance.

15

QUESTION:

Well, the language of the statute, of

16

course, is rather explicit.

17

authorizes citizens to commit civil actions, except as

18

provided in subsection (b) or (c).

19

actions prohibited — no action may be commenced under

20

subsection (a) unless the notice is given.

21

MR. BUCKLEY:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BUCKLEY:

It says that subsection (a)

And subsection (b) says

Yes, the language is very —

I mean, that's pretty explicit.
Well, yes, it is.

But this Court, in a

24

number of other cases where private attorney generals have

25

been entrusted by Congress with the right to bring an action

1

to enforce policies that Congress deems important, has held

2

that similarly explicit requirements are not a basis for

3

requiring dismissal and refiling.

4

QUESTION:

Well, of course it's possible that the

5

legislative history here indicates that at least, in part,

6

those provisions were intended to prevent the federal courts

7

from having to deal with litigation until after the government

8

agencies had an opportunity at least to act.

9

MR. BUCKLEY:

Right, and the legislative history in

10

this case dealt primarily with a situation, this particular

11

situation, that there are going to be lots and lots and lots

12

of violations of environmental law out there, and it can't be

13

expected that the government is going to be able to monitor

14

every single violation out there.

15

would be a good idea to enlist the aid and the eyes and the

16

ears of the citizens to uncover those violations.

17

And it was thought that it

And so it was thought that if there is an unknown

18

violation out there that the government doesn't know about,

19

then it's a good idea to allow the citizens to bring that to

20

the attention of the government so the government can make its

21

own investigation or prioritize.

22

because it doesn't have the — pardon me — it doesn't have

23

the resources to go after every single violation.

24

course, it was thought then that if the government did not

25

act, that the citizen could then bring a suit.

I mean, it has to prioritize

And, of

1

Well, in this particular case, and the reason that I

2

focus on the facts of this case is because there are going to

3

be unique facts presented all the time, and the reason, since

4

there are going to be unique facts presented all the time,

5

it's a good idea to let the District Courts have the

6

flexibility to meet real life situations.

7

QUESTION:

Or is it a good idea to have a rule that

8

everybody can understand?

9

MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, that is true.

You know, a bright

10

line rule always has the advantage of giving clarity and a

11

bright line rule, but that's also —

12

QUESTION:

In this case, I take it, under this statute,

13

one of the prohibitions on bringing this suit is if the

14

government has itself brought a suit, correct?

15

MR. BUCKLEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

Yes.

And how do you know whether or not that

statutory exception has been met by the government?

18

MR. BUCKLEY:

19

has brought a suit or not?

20
21
22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You mean how do I know if the government

Yes.

What do you look for?

The first thing

you do to see whether action, what -- has been filed?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, I suppose that you could do that.

Usually, I suppose —
QUESTION:

But isn't, doesn't, isn't the point that the

statute (b)(2) says that if the administrator or state has

1

commenced and is diligently prosecuting.

2

MR. BUCKLEY:

3

QUESTION:

Urn hum.

So the statute itself makes a distinction

4

between commencement and prosecution, and it seems to me that

5

we should interpret the word commencement the same way in the

6

previous paragraph.

7

MR. BUCKLEY:

8

interpret it, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

I do.

But if that is so, commencement means

10

filing, doesn't it?

11

MR. BUCKLEY:

12

Well, I think that is the apparent way to

Yes, it does.

I agree.

I don't think —

I think there's room for disagreement given the legislative

13

history, but I think that that is the best interpretation.

14

But also in the legislative history there was —

15

QUESTION:

But if you agree with that it seems to me

16

that you must lose, because you commenced the action without

17

going through the waiting period and the notice period.

18

MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, if I may answer, yes, that is true

19

if you look only at that particular section and don't try to

20

interpret that section in the context of the statute as a

21

whole, and if you don't instead also look to the purpose that

22

that provision was intended to serve.

23

QUESTION:

You have to argue that this is one of those

24

rare instances when the Court shouldn't apply the statute as

25

it is written.

1

MR. BUCKLEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

That is basically what you are saying, that

we shouldn't —

4

MR. BUCKLEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

We don't do that very often, but you think

MR. BUCKLEY:

I think that would effectuate the will of

Congress in this particular case, when —
QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, I am making that argument.

that's what we should do here.

7
8

Yes.

And yet, it certainly would be workable as a

scheme and as a statute if we did enforce it as it's written.
MR. BUCKLEY:

11

I think it would be at the cost of

12

injustice in many cases, and I think it would also be at the

13

cost of defeating the will of Congress on the statute as a

14

whole.

15

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think once the rule is clear

16

that people would understand that that is the requirement?

17

how would it result in injustices thereafter?

18

MR. BUCKLEY:

So

Well, first of all, if there are other

19

lawyers like me out there, who realize that that is a

20

requirement, and yet, as I said between the intention and the

21

execution something falls through the cracks, and, at the same

22

time the government in fact has, the government with

23

enforcement authority has actual authority, has actual notice,

24

and decides to do nothing, then to have the Court impose a

25

bright line rule would have the result, in this case, of

1

requiring a dismissal and refiling to serve no congressional

2

purpose.

3

QUESTION:

Congress could have written it that way.

4

Congress could have said, you know, no action may be commenced

5

unless the administrator has been given notice or is given

6

notice within a reasonable period after commencement.

7

could have written it a lot of different ways.

8

write it this way, and this way you —you're clearly wrong.

9

You have an appealing case, your case, because the judge told

It

It happened to

10

you never mind, I won't dismiss the suit, go file, don't,

11

you'll just have to file it all over again, we'll shortcut it

all.

13

asking us to adopt a general rule that will permit this to be

14

done regularly.

15

judicial estoppel or something, but that is not what you're

16

arguing.

I agree that your case is an appealing one, but you're

I wish you were just arguing some kind of

17

MR. BUCKLEY:

18

QUESTION:

Well, I am .arguing judicial estoppel.

Well, no, you're arguing the statute should

19

generally, for everyone, be interpreted this way so that

20

judges in the future can do just what this judge did here, and

21

could say, it doesn't matter that you haven't given notice.

22

So long as it's here, give notice now, and we'll keep the

23

case.

24
25

That is how I read your brief.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, I'm arguing that the Court should

interpret the requirement of notice to be a procedural

requirement, one that the District Court can have flexibility

to meet real life situations.
QUESTION:

Right.

So that District Courts can rewrite

MR. BUCKLEY:

rewrite the statute.

intent.

To enforce the intent of the statute.

I

We are not in the business of enforcing

We are in the business of enforcing statutes.

10

are a lot of different ways of achieving the possible

11

congressional intent.

12

the word commenced means commenced.

Not to

MR. BUCKLEY:

There

It chose one way, and you acknowledged

Well, in other situations in the civil

14

rights context, this Court has held that similar prelitigation

15

requirements specified by Congress in similar mandatory

16

language are, in fact, requirements where the Court can

17

fashion a remedy.

18

Court said that dismissal and refiling is not good, that a

19

stay would be far more appropriate to allow the litigant in

20

that case time to provide the notice to the state.

In fact, in the Oscar Mayer case, this

21

And the same thing was held in the Baldwin case;

22

however in the Baldwin case, the Court held that the Plaintiff

23

in that case had not satisfied the requirement because she had

been told three times what she had to do.

And that's not what

specifically said that this, that Baldwin wasn't a case where

2

the District Court had led the plaintiff in that case —

3

QUESTION:

Well, I suspect there are cases where we've

4

stuck by the strict wording and cases where we haven't struck

5

by, stuck by the strict wording.

6

reason to when we do and when we don't?

7

MR. BUCKLEY:

Is there any rhyme nor

I think that the rhyme or reason is that

8

the Court generally tries to construe remedial statutes, and

9

particularly statutes that are enforced by private attorney

10

generals, to effectuate the remedial purpose of the statute.

11

And to require dismissal and refiling in this case would be,

12

would serve no purpose.

13

Environmental Quality knew about the violation before the case

14

was filed, before the notice was given, and didn't do

15

anything.

16

the formal notice was given and didn't do anything.

17

I mean after all, the Department of

It knew about the filing of the case even before

QUESTION:

It had served the purpose of making that

18

inquiry unnecessary in future cases.

If we simply held today

19

commenced means commenced, you can look on the paper record

20

and say, you know, was the notice given before it was

21

commenced or not?

22

argue for is a rule that says, in every case we'll have to

23

look to whether the substance of the rule, whether the real

24

purpose to be achieved by the rule, was somehow achieved in

25

another fashion.

That is an end of the matter.

1

how many others there are out there that the lower courts

2

might have to wrestle with.

3

MR. BUCKLEY:

But there probably are not many other

4

exceptions.

5

flexibility to the District Court, is to rule in the

6

exceptional case, as this one is, that — that to require

7

dismissal and refiling when there is only nine days left in

8

the period would be a waste of judicial resources.

9

I mean, one of the advantages of giving

QUESTION:

Well, this won't be exceptional if we say

10

that this doesn't mean what it says, is what I am saying.

11

This case will not be exceptional.

12

made, why not a lot of other ones that achieve the substantial

13

purpose of the statute?

14

MR. BUCKLEY:

If this exception can be

Well, I think that -- that's what this

15

Court should hold, and I think that's what this Court has held

16

repeatedly.

17

result that is plainly at variance with the policy of the

18

statute, that you have to go along and look behind the statute

19

to try to interpret the statute to achieve the purpose.

Oh, it's a District Court case?

11

MR. BUCKLEY:

It's a District Court case, and the point

12

of that is not that it has precedential value, but that it

13

presented a unique factual situation, as this case does, where

14

it made sense for the District Court to have discretion.

15

that particular case, the Army Corps of Engineers knew that

16

the citizens were concerned about the dumping of polluted,

17

dredged material on a beach somewhere, and knew that it was

18

also, under statutory requirements, under the National

19

Environmental Protection Act, the Marine Protection Act, and

20

the Water Pollution Act, that it had to have public hearings

21

and notices and certain time periods had to be — had to be

22

observed, like 90 days for circulation of a draft

It violated those statutes and let the contract out

I do think that was a correct result

looked at the legislative history, it determined that the

10

importation of unskilled manual labor.

determined that that — that there was even some discussion

it is not now corrected.

1

And, it seems to me, that if the Court were to say that

this case had to be dismissed and refiled, that the message

that citizens and citizens groups would be hearing throughout

4

the country is that this Court is going to interpret strictly

5

provisions that are against the citizens.

6

I guess — I hate to say this, but it is just not fair to say

to the citizens, sure, it is fine for you to spend $95,000 and

MR. BUCKLEY:

That is correct.

plaintiffs.
QUESTION:

Well, it might, but it certainly results in

3

some unfortunate, an unfortunate situation in this case,

4

doesn't it?

5

MR. HUNSAKER:

There is no question about that, Justice

6

O'Connor, and I think this Court has said on a number of

7

occasions that the Court's sympathy for a particular plaintiff

8

is no reason to ignore the clear meaning of a statute.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

And, of course, the Court has overlooked,

apparently, clear meaning in the Title 7 context?
MR. HUNSAKER:

It has, but Justice O'Connor, those

12

cases do not contain anywhere near the kind of clear language,

13

we submit, that is in this statute.

14

that, as I said a few minutes ago, that the Plaintiffs are

15

essentially urging, by their argument, that the word commence

16

means maintaine.

17

Justice Scalia in Gwaltney, and joined in by Justices Stevens

18

and O'Connor, draws that distinction between commence and

maintain, and it just, it's untenable to say that it means

20

something other than what it says.

21

And I submit that the concurring opinion of

But as to the argument that somehow this statute does

not speak, the notice provision is not jurisdictional.

11

So you can't read subsections (a) and (b)
They have to be read together.

And I think by

And that subsection (b) is titled,

"Actions

And that was in the original act as passed by

Congress.
QUESTION:

Well, now tell me why those words

unequivocally say that if you fail to give notice that,

13

something that is filed without the notice must be dismissed,

14

rather than just stayed.

15

then an adequate remedy for this failure?

been the failure you certainly wouldn't stay a case, but the

judge says I think it's a perfectly adequate remedy for this

failure, for this unfortunate failure, to stay the case.

isn't that an adequate remedy for it?

20

MR. HUNSAKER:

No action.

You

1

Or it cannot be

commenced, begun, by filing the complaint.

They had -- if you

3

say it can be stayed, you said that the words prohibit and

4

commenced are meaningless, or don't mean what they say,

5

because you have said that you can go ahead and commence but

6

we will stay, but you can't maintain it until you give the

that the Congress did, in fact, intend for this to be a

But the more -- I think an equally important reason is

11

the overall statutory scheme; it wasn't to allow citizens to

12

come in and file these suits without first triggering the

13

administrative action.

14

Gwaltney, the primary enforcement tool is supposed, should be

15

the administrative agencies, either the EPA or the state.

16

the Court said in Gwaltney, the central purpose of these

17

citizen provisions, and they were talking about now the Clean

18

Air and Clean Water Acts which are identical to this act, the

19

central purpose of these provisions is to permit citizens to

20

abate pollution when the government cannot or will not command

21

compliance.

22

And as this Court recognized in

As

And the Court in Gwaltney also said that the purpose of

23

the citizen suit notice provision is to give the alleged

24

violator an opportunity to bring itself into complete

25

compliance and render unnecessary a citizen suit.

But

1

significantly they said it is intended to encourage citizen

2

participation, but only as a supplement or secondary to.

3

Justice White, if you say that you can simply stay

4

these procedures, notwithstanding the fact that no notice has

5

been given, then it seems to me you undermine the whole

6

purpose of the statutory scheme which is clearly set forth

7

that the primary purpose is to allow the agencies to enforce.

8

And, in fact, it is significant, as one of the justices

9

pointed out this morning, that one of the, the statute clearly

10

provides that if the government, the administrator or state

11

has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or

12

criminal action in a court of the United States, no citizen

13

suit can be maintained.

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18

That is in subsection (b) too.

Do you think the, whoever was entitled to

the notice, could waive this requirement?
MR. HUNSAKER:

Well, I guess my first response would be

that is clearly not the case here, but no, I don't think so.

MR. HUNSAKER:

22

the Plaintiffs to the Ninth Circuit, was that no attorney fees

before commencing a lawsuit and if not then the lawsuit must

predictable, and you make it even-handed.

12

On the other hand, if you hold, as the Plaintiffs

13

contend, that the suit may be stayed until the requisite

14

notice is given, you make every citizen suit amenable to

15

appeals and after the fact wrangling over whether or not the

16

plaintiff, the citizen, complied with the statute and whether

17

adequate notice was given, whether the administrative

18

agencies, if you will, were given that meaningful opportunity.

And I think that will surely guarantee endless litigation and

20

wasteful litigation.

It is significant in this case, or telling, that the

District Court premised his decision denying the motion for

the District Court would have granted the motion for summary

judgment and dismissed the lawsuit because of the undisputed

failure by the Plaintiffs to file their notice.

12

Plaintiffs could then have given the 60 days notice and then

refiled their lawsuit, as they indicated in their notice that

MR. HUNSAKER:

precedent that we would be set would be clogging of the courts

15

Appeals correctly ruled based on Judge Wisdom's sound

Congress that cannot be altered by the courts, that anything

the notice requirement would effectively render the provision

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

This is, we submit, a case of statutory construction.

8

It is not a case that asks the Court to adopt the best rule or

to interpret one of its own rules or a rule of federal common

Mr. Martin, may I go back to Justice White's

the remedy for violating that duty.

MR. MARTIN:

Actions are commenced and they remain on

jurisdiction and dismiss it.

QUESTION:

Yes, but the lower court took the position

that it could remedy it by entering a stay and allowing —
MR. MARTIN:

Well, we think that remedy is plainly

inconsistent with the statute, whether it is a jurisdictional

requirement that can never be waived or — we're talking about

an intent of Congress, so Congress can intend anything they
