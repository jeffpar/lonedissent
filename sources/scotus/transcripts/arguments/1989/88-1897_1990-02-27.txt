MR. CASEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In a series of cases involving Fourth Amendment

12

challenges to various traffic-checking procedures, the

13

Court has applied a balancing test which weighs the public

14

interest against the right of individuals to be free from

15

arbitrary interference.

16

recognized that different procedures involve different

17

balances and different constitutional safeguards.

18

example, probable cause is required for a search of a

19

vehicle either by a roving patrol or at a fixed

20

checkpoint.

In these cases, the Court

For

21

A seizure of an automobile by a roving patrol is

22

permissible if it is based on reasonable suspicion, and in

23

Martinez-Fuerte the Court held that seizure of an

24

automobile at a fixed checkpoint is permissible without

25

individualized suspicion if there are neutral and

1

objective guidelines which limit the discretion of

2

officers in the field and limit the nature of the

3

intrusion.

4

The case today presents no new legal issues.

5

The only question is whether Michigan's temporary sobriety

6

checkpoints are like the roving patrols in Delaware v.

7

Prouse or, as we argue, are more like the fixed

8

checkpoints in Martinez-Fuerte in which no individualized

9

suspicion is required.

their capacity as licensed drivers in the State of

Michigan who allege that if sobriety checkpoints were

operated there was a very great likelihood that they would

be subject to the checkpoints.

would be subjected to them.

We agree.

8

controversy to confer standing in both the state courts

20

high as the likelihood that individual citizens in

21

Michigan will be subjected to sobriety checkpoints.

standing to permit the Court to address this question as a

facial constitutional challenge without waiting for an

appalling number of deaths and injuries and the staggering

16

economic costs caused by alcohol-related traffic crashes.

17

The committee which drafted the Michigan guidelines

observed that in 1984 in Michigan alone there were 800

this is going on.
In the Maryland study which our committee relied

2

3

on and examined very closely, public opinion survey cards

4

were returned by the drivers who went through the Maryland

5

survey, and I believe the figure was 87 percent of the

6

cards which were returned indicated that they were not

opposed to the checkpoints, and 90 percent of them felt

8

that there was some deterrent effect.

QUESTION:

That type of checkpoint is

standard procedure.

QUESTION:

They're not operated very frequently.

high crime and a great many shootings.

11

Do you suppose that Michigan could set up a
pedestrian checkpoint and frisk people for weapons?
MR. CASEY:

I doubt if they could frisk them.

You'd get into the case of Terry v. Ohio on when a police
officer can pat down a person on the street.
What we're saying here is that the checkpoints

12

are located at times and in places where there is a

13

demonstrated history of alcohol-related crashes.

14

accident statistics are fed into a computer, and the

15

checkpoints are placed in locations where there has been a

16

history of accidents or high arrest rate.

Are the same standards applicable to

QUESTION:

2

MR. CASEY:

Same legal standards, same rules?
Correct.

The purpose is a little

3

different, but the Court has recognized in Delaware v.

4

Prouse, for example, that the state -- pardon me -- the

5

state has a very significant interest in assuring that

6

drivers are properly licensed and have proof of insurance

7

and registration and that vehicles have the required

8

safety equipment.

The nature of the problem here is even more

10

serious than that.

and tens of thousands of injuries every year.

We're talking about hundreds of deaths

In Brown v. Texas, the Court applied a balancing

13

test and discussed several of the traffic-checking cases.

14

In all the parties below in state courts, we use the Brown

15

v. Texas articulation as the standard.

16

identified three factors which go into weighing whether a

17

particular procedure is reasonable or not:

18

the public concern, the extent to which the seizure

19

advances the public interest and the severity of the

20

interference with individual liberty.

There, the court

2

the checkpoints were not effective enough.

3

Michigan said that we did not prove a sufficiently high

4

arrest rate, we did not prove long-term deterrent effects

from the operation of the checkpoints and we did not prove

that they were the most effective method the police could

MR. CASEY:

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
And it's agreed that it may — it —

procedures.

In Delaware v. Prouse --

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Casey, when you say -- when you

3

say this is a seizure, you mean it's a -- it's — it's

4

like an arrest or it's like a Terry stop?
MR. CASEY:

5

It is less intrusive than a

6

traditional arrest.

The cars are required to stop for a

7

period of 20 to 30 seconds at the checkpoint.

8

coming through in a certain direction are required to

9

stop.

All cars

In Michigan our checkpoint guidelines are set up

10
11

so that cars can turn off before they enter the check

12

lane, and on the one checkpoint which was operated, I

13

believe the record shows that six cars either made U-

14

turns or turned off before they entered the checkpoint.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CASEY:

What is the purpose of that?
The checkpoint guidelines were

17

developed with every effort to minimize the intrusion, and

18

that I suspect was one element of the effort.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

So, you want to let the drunks get

away?
MR. CASEY:

It would be easy to design a more

22

effective checkpoint than we have, but to do that would

23

probably require a greater intrusion.

24

the Michigan officials chose was to give as much weight as

25

possible to minimizing the amount of intrusion.

The balance that

QUESTION:

1
2

Would the U-turn provide probable --

articulate suspicion for a stop?
MR. CASEY:

3

Not by itself.

If the U-turn was

4

done in a fashion that violated traffic laws or if there

5

was some erratic driving or some other articulable

6

suspicion, then the guidelines say that that would be

7

enough to pursue the driver.

8

lawful U-turn would not be enough.

But just the mere fact of a

Under the Martinez-Fuerte case the court said

that all cars coming through the checkpoint could be

11

seized and the officers running the checkpoint could

There are several police cars to be

The case we principally rely on, of course, is

the Martinez-Fuerte case.

and may it please the Court:
We join in Mr. Casey's analysis of the legal

3

principles that govern this case, but if the Court please,

4

I will focus first on those features of the problem of

5

drunk driving in this country that have made it so

6

resistant to traditional law enforcement techniques and on

7

some of the reasons why sobriety checkpoints have been

8

widely recognized as the important elements of effective

9

drunk driving programs.

10

Mr. Casey indicated there has been no dispute in

11

this case that the problem of drinking and driving is a

12

very serious one.

13

for purposes of the Court's balancing test and to

14

appreciate just how grave that interest is.

15

It is important, nevertheless, to pause

If one were to prepare a list of the most

16

important and serious threats to public health and safety

17

in this country, drunk driving would have to be at or near

18

the top of the list.

19

In 1988, 47,000 people were killed in traffic

20

crashes in this country.

21

involved, 25 percent were intoxicated legally at the time

22

of the accident.

Justice O'Connor's question, is the problem any less

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

You Honor, a frisk is a much

more intrusive form of interference with 4th Amendment

4

interests than a traffic stop.

6

the Court noted that it was a well-established practice.

Its utility had been accepted as an incident of travel on

the roads, and it is a very, very minimal interference

No, Your Honor, I wouldn't

think so.
QUESTION:

And it does have the right to insist

that you have a license to drive.
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

That's true, driving is a very

17

highly regulated activity in this country, in keeping with

18

the risk that it presents to others on the road.

QUESTION:

So it's not inconceivable that you

might have a traffic stop not just for intoxication, but

for drug use.

In the Mackey v. Montran case, which involved

17

deciding the case or controversy that's brought to us for

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

but I think in this case the question is whether there is

a reasonable basis for a conclusion on the part of the

state authorities that this is a potentially effective

means of reducing drinking and driving.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Nightingale.

MR. GRANZOTTO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two reasons why the decision of the

12

Michigan Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.

13

The first is based on this Court's decision last term in

14

Von Raab, and also in the Court's decision in Skinner.

15

In that case — in those two cases, this Court

16

indicated the situations under which the Court would refer

17

to the balancing test in determining whether a particular

18

Fourth Amendment intrusion was in fact unconstitutional.

19

In Von Raab and Skinner, this Court indicated

20

that where the particular type of intrusion serves law

21

enforcement needs — or, excuse me — serves governmental

22

needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement, then the

23

Court would refer to a balancing test.

24

criminal laws.

4

And that is to enforce the

Under the decisions of this Court's last term,

5

in Skinner and Von Raab, this Court need not even refer to

6

the balancing test, in light of the fact that there is no

7

dispute that the reason this particular seizure takes

8

place is to in fact enforce the criminal law.

10

QUESTION:

How about Martinez-Fuerte?

MR. GRANZOTTO:

Martinez-Fuerte -- Justice

11

Powell, in his decision in that case, in a footnote,

12

indicated that many of the seizures which take place in a

13

-- at the border search or at the border stops, resulted

14

in something which did not go to a formal charge.

15

But, in fact --

16

QUESTION:

17
18

But it was -- it was enforcing the

criminal law, nonetheless?
MR. GRANZOTTO:

That's correct.

That's correct.

19

Martinez-Fuerte was of course a criminal case.

20

back to Almeida-Sanchez, three years before

21

Martinez-Fuerte, Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion

22

in that case, indicated that only 3 percent of all cars

23

that were stopped — or, excuse me -- of all persons who

24

were stopped for violations of — of the border -- illegal

25

aliens, only 3 percent of those people were in fact

Therefore, we have a situation which is just

1

Because in the Von Raab case, for example, there was no --

2

there was -- there was no chance of there ever being a

3

criminal prosecution in light of the fact that these --

4

the testing which took place in Von Raab couldn't be used

5

unless by the agreement of the person whose test was being

6

taken in a criminal proceeding.

7

QUESTION:

Well, but, I thought the point you

8

were making was that Martinez-Fuerte was really not a

9

criminal case, because so few people were prosecuted under

10

11

it?
MR. GRANZOTTO:

No, that's not what I'm saying.

12

This Court has decided in New York v. Burger that a — a

13

particular type of scheme can have both — both an

14

administrative nature and a criminal nature.

15

Martinez-Fuerte fit squarely within the

16

dichotomy which was drawn in this Court in New York v.

17

Burger, because, as Justice Powell indicated, only 3

18

percent of these cases actually result in prosecution.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but that doesn't mean it's an

would also indicate to the Court that this Court has

2

indicated since Martinez-Fuerte that there is -- there is

3

a — a nexus to the border -- the border which allowed the

4

Court to make the decision in Martinez-Fuerte as it did.
And that's the case of Montoya de Hernandez.

5
6

Because, in that case, the Court indicated that the

7

decision in Martinez-Fuerte was, in fact, connected to

8

this -- this country's vested right to protect its

9

borders.
And in that sense, the whole concept of a

10
11

probable cause or reasonable suspicion requirement was

12

automatically out of the Martinez-Fuerte case to begin

13

with.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Granzotto, what -- what do you do

15

about truck checkpoints on -- which exist on many state

16

highways, requiring trucks to pull over to determine

whether they're overloaded and whether their safety

equipment is operational?

19

MR. GRANZOTTO:

To some extent, those cases may

20

fell — fall within the balancing test, even under this

21

Court's decision in Von Raab and Skinner, because they may

involve, in particular states certainly, noncriminal

MR. GRANZOTTO:

That's correct.

Mr. Granzotto, would it have made a

difference if these weren't stops along the way, but if

talked about at length.
There -- there are three factors which were

analyzed in this case.

The gravity of the public harm is

bring this case to minimize the dangers associated with

drunk driving in this country.

And on that we have no dispute.

We did not

What we attempted to prove and did, in fact,

9
10

prove to the satisfaction of the trial court in this case

11

was that sobriety roadblocks are just not an effective

means of addressing that serious societal problem.
We presented in this case the testimony of Dr.

That's correct, after further

10

investigation, obviously, and more -- obviously more

11

extensive investigation that's been -- that takes place.

12

There are — as well, there is a point made by

13

the — the State in this case with respect to the

14

discretion which is allotted the people who conduct these

15

patrols.

16

scope of the intrusion which is involved in the case.

The State argues that that discretion limits the

17

We had testimony in this case from Inspector

18

Fladseth of the State Police who indicated that when a

19

person approaches this sobriety roadblock, that person can

20

be diverted for further investigation for any reason or

21

for no reason at all; therefore, the answer that was

22

supplied before with respect to failing to open the

23

window, if somebody could be diverted for further

24

investigation for failing to open the window, the answer

25

to that question is yes, they can be, because Inspector

1

Fladseth candidly acknowledged during the course of his

2

testimony that the officer who is — who is confronting

3

the person driving up in the car can divert that person

4

for further investigation, more extensive investigation,

5

for any reason, or for no reason.

6

QUESTION:

If -- if only 1 percent of drunk

7

driving is — are arrested in this manner and one-third of

8

those diverted are found to be drunk, only 3 percent then

9

are diverted; is that about right?

10

MR. GRANZOTTO:

11

I -- I am also concerned and -- about the scope

That's correct.

12

of the intrusion which can take place in these sobriety

13

roadblocks, because if this Court does in fact approve

14

sobriety roadblocks, the stop itself, there are a number

15

of necessary results which would obtain on the basis of

16

prior decisions of this Court, on the basis of

17

Pennsylvania v. Mimms and on the basis of Brown v. Texas.

18

There are a number of actions, conduct which the

19

police can take in this situation, undeniably, if this

20

Court does in fact approve sobriety roadblocks; that is,

21

the stop itself.

22

MR. GRANZOTTO:

We brought this case not in

23

attempt — not in an attempt to demonstrate that drunk

24

driving is not a serious societal problem in this country.

25

What we attempted to show in this case, what in fact the

2

roadblocks are not an effective means of combatting that

serious societal problem.
Under the balancing test, therefore, what we

have, I believe, is a serious problem.

intrusion which may be minimal in some respects, but it is

7

an intrusion which does not accomplish anything.

that basis we would ask that under -- under the Court's

balancing test as it's been adopted that these sobriety

I do have a

question.
Do you agree with the statement that was just

made that these parties at the roadblock could be pulled

over for further investigation for any reason or for no

reason?

we're talking about the degree of intrusion is being

of intrusion without articulable suspicion could be as

Because that — that bears upon the

That statement is not accurate.

One — in one sentence in a deposition, one of the

10

deputies on a cross-examination said that there could be

11

reliance on any number of factors or perhaps no factor.
That's not what the law says.

That's not the law in Michigan.

Under the guidelines and the way the Michigan

program is set up, drivers cannot be diverted for further

questioning unless there are visible, articulable signs of

intoxication.

QUESTION:

That appears in the text of the

guidelines ?

Yes.
