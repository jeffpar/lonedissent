ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LANDRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a challenge by the Petitioner to a

12

judgment of the district court in the northern district of

Ohio, which was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, dismissing a

two-count complaint brought by the Petitioner against this

The second count was brought under the

The district court dismissed the case on a motion for

19

summary judgment and dismissed it on jurisdictional grounds

inasmuch as because the case involved allegations that the

21

Petitioner was discriminatorily refused job referrals on an

22

out-of-work list, that the case was -- preempted by the

The Sixth Circuit affirmed on the jurisdictional basis

3

and additionally added that, because the out-of-work list was

4

available to use by members of the union and non-members, it

5

could not constitute discipline under Teamsters v. Leu,

6

because non-members also could use the out-of-work list.

was an issue which was not reached by the district court.

This

The duty of fair representation, we believe, is
certainly involved in this case.

The duty developed over 40

10

years ago in response to a need by the individual members of

11

the union to have redress for arbitrary union activity.

12

Vaca v. Sipes in 1987, this Court also embraced the duty of

13

fair representation again, subsequent to the National Labor

14

Relations Board recognition of the duty of fair representation

15

as an unfair labor practice in Miranda Fuel.

In

16

The duty of fair representation is a bulwark for

17

redress by individual union members for arbitrary union

18

conduct, and we believe that, because there is a congressional

19

grant of exclusive representation authority to the individual

20

labor unions, that the constitutionality of this grant would

21

be called into question if the individual employee, the

22

individual member of the union, were deprived of the right to

23

a judicial forum to redress arbitrary conduct.

Thus, we see no reason to restrict the availability of
the duty of fair representation, and any remedy for redress of

the jurisdiction ought to be concurrent with that of the

QUESTION:

Mr. Landry, do you take the position that

5

any action by the union that harms one of its members is

6

actionable?

case, for it to constitute disciplinary action.

Additionally, --

MR. LANDRY:

It needn't — no.

That's not

It need not, under a

17

duty of fair representation analysis, additionally under

18

Landrum-Griffin analysis, it is our contention that a finding

19

of discipline is not necessary for this case, either for the

20

reason that the rights alleged to have been infringed by the

21

local union under the Landrum-Griffin claim involved free

22

speech claims under Section 101(a)(2) of the Lahdrum-Griffin

23

Act.

1

protected by Section 101(a)(2).

And Section 609 of Landrum-

2

Griffin applies to discipline for engaging in protected

3

activities.

So that is covered.

4

But even if it does not rise to the level of

5

discipline, the Petitioner did plead Section 102 --

QUESTION:

To violate the National Labor Relations Act,

7

however, doesn't the action have to relate to the individuals

rights as an employee?

violation of the duty of unfair -- duty of fair

Would -- would -- would it be a

10

representation, for the union to send some goons over to break

up the — you know, On the Waterfront.

over some mobsters to destroy somebody's house, having nothing

13

to do with the employment rights of the individual.

14

that be a failure of the duty of -- I mean, it may be

15

criminal, but would that violate the National Labor Relations

16

Act?

17

MR. LANDRY:

Johnny Friendly sends

Would

With respect to the duty of fair

18

representation act -- duty of fair representation doctrine,

19

the cases have considered the duty of fair representation of

20

the union to be co-extensive to its authority as a

21

representative of the individual.

22

QUESTION:

So —

Well, as a representative vis a vis the

23

employer.

Isn't that right?

I mean, the very term

24

representation, it -- it has to relate to the employee's

25

rights against the employer, no?

MR. LANDRY:

We believe it -- yes, it -- it would, but

2

it could go beyond that as far as the unions negotiation,

collective bargaining agreement —

QUESTION:

All of which relate to what the individual

employee gets from the employer.

that doesn't in — like jobs, like salary, like working

conditions and so forth.

involve the employee's relation to his employer?

MR. LANDRY:

13

No?

Do you know any case that doesn't

As long —
Or prospective employer.
Yes.

However, rights, the Landrum-Griffin

Act claims, go beyond that analysis.

QUESTION:

15

MR. LANDRY:

Do you know any case

And --

Right.
-- basically deal with the internal, the

16

member's rights against his own union.

17

believe that the free speech claims, under your analysis, if

18

the union would send out someone to physically harm a union

19

member, that would fall under an infringement of Title I of

20

the Landrum-Griffin Act, the Bill of Rights, and would

21

therefore be actionable as an infringement.

22

would constitute discipline or not would be -- is very --

difficult --

So, therefore, we

Mr. Landry, you have been asked a couple of

questions about the duty of fair representation claim, and

Are you abandoning your duty of fair representation

I'm trying to —

QUESTION:

9

No, we are not abandoning it.

We're —

But are you agreeing with Justice Scalia

that it just doesn't apply in a case like this?
MR. LANDRY:

We believe it does apply in a case like

this, because this contract, or this out-of-work referral

10

system, was established by the collective bargaining

11

agreement, where and in the collective bargaining agreement,

12

Article 5 of that agreement, places a duty upon the — places

13

a contractual obligation on the union to furnish workers upon

14

request by the employer.

15

submit letters of request to the union, and after 48 hours

16

period, if the union is unable to furnish sufficient workers

17

in order to fulfill the employer's need, then the — at that

18

point, the employer can go out and fill his needs with other -

And the employer, if he — can

QUESTION:

So the union's actions depends on who gets a

job, who's referred.

employment relationship with the employer.

4

MR. LANDRY:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

In —

Just in case you are in any confusion, my

problem is not whether the duty of fair representation applies

7

to this.

8

disciplinary provision applies to this.

I -- I think it does.

MR. LANDRY:
QUESTION:

My problem is whether the

Yes, and I —
Are you going to address that one?

You —

11

you — you said the word discipline could be narrower.

12

isn't it narrower?

13

rights that are distinctive to the union employee, his rights

14

as a union member, as opposed to his rights as an employee,

15

whether he is a union member or not.

16

MR. LANDRY:

Why

Why doesn't it relate only to taking away

The purpose, Justice Scalia, for the

17

enactment of the Landrum-Griffin Act in the '50s, was concern

18

that the -- that there were intra-union problems that were not

19

being addressed by the National Labor Relations Act.

20

will -- the purpose of this is to ensure that there is an

21

overriding analysis that unions are democratically governed

22

within themselves and responsive to the will of the majority

23

of the union.

And there is

Discipline, the concept of what would constitute

6

discipline, it is our contention, can also involve employment

7

rights in this particular case because the — we have

8

basically a job referral system through a hiring hall system.

9

And the union — the -- the whole purpose of the hiring hall

10

is to control who, and refer members to jobs.

Okay, now, the

14

QUESTION:

Not just union members.

Everybody.

Right?

I mean, any employee?
MR. LANDRY:

That is correct.

We understand that, we

15

would concede that theoretically, in theory, that a non­

16

employee, a non-member, could make use of the, of this job

referral system.

to use job referrals and to use the union — the hiring halls,

Excuse me.

And basically what

Yes, he is.

But —

Well, then, it is not distinctive to the

union.
MR. LANDRY:

But it's — it's a feature, and it's an

It's also an important feature of non-union

It's like breathing in and oxit.

MR. LANDRY:

How -- however, for example, I think in

the real — operation of the real world, employers lean

18

heavily on the use of these hiring halls, and in order — in

19

depriving a union member of the use of a hiring hall, what

20

you're telling that union member is that the only way you are

21

going to come back here, if it is for a reason that, under --

22

if it is for a protected reason, as we have here, you are

23

telling that union member that look, either you recant your

position opposing our union leadership, or leave the union.

1

it's a failure of a duty of fair representation to deprive any

2

member, union or not, of that -- of that feature, but every

3

time the word discipline is used in the statute, the word

4

discipline that you are relying upon, it -- it's part of a

5

whole series of words.

6

suspended, expelled or otherwise disciplined.

7

means, to me, internal, internal sanctions relating to union

8

membership, not something totally external.

9
10
11

MR. LANDRY:

It says no member may be fined,
That — that

But the statute, Section 609, does refer

to other -- otherwise discipline as well.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it's in a series of words, and it's

12

standard statutory construction that — that one word in

13

another series is -- is colored by those other words.

And the

14

only other words put in there are all internal stuff:

fined,

expelled, suspended or otherwise disciplined.

QUEST]ON:

I --

However
I find it very strange to think that that

18

means anything except something pertaining to your status qua

union member.

20

MR. LANDRY:

However, this union out of work referral

list is administered by the officials of the union, and when

22

-- for -- when you have facts as we have in this case, that

leadership, and — and when the leadership, under color of

1

their authority as leaders in the union, seek to deprive a

2

union member of this right to obtain referrals under that

3

system, then they are affecting his -- they are using their

4

authority as union leaders to affect his rights as a member

5

that he would otherwise have.

6

QUESTION:

But I would suppose that would be the case

7

if the — if the union officers inflicted any harm upon the

8

member, by reason of its dissatisfaction with the members

MR. LANDRY:

10

We believe there might be a line to be

11

drawn in -- in that area, and it is a very difficult one to

12

draw.

forcing that union member to choose between protected rights

or the loss — or the fear of the loss of job opportunities,

15

or job reprisals.

16

be a penalty, some sort of penalty which would be involved.

17

At some point, if there is clearly unauthorized activity, for

18

example, physical abuse, we believe that that might fall under

19

infringement if it was for protective activity; it may not

20

fall under the term discipline.

21

The use of — the deprivation of jobs basically is

At some point, again, there would have to

However, it appears that discipline such as — such as

22

restricting union member from the use of job referrals is a

23

traditional form of discipline which is used in some cases.

24

For example, 90-day benching, which means taking them off the

25

list for 90 days, is commonly used.

1

How about breaking his leg?

I mean, the

2

Johnny Friendly example again.

3

sends over a mobster to break his leg for opposing the union

4

leadership.

Is that discipline?

MR. LANDRY:

5

The union — union leader

That — that, we believe, may constitute

6

an infringement of rights.

7

it is not a traditional type of —
QUESTION:

8

9

It may not be discipline because

So, there are infringements of rights that

are not discipline, and -- and -- and some things, some

10

protections of the union members' rights under Title XXIX have

11

to be guaranteed in other ways than under this -- the LMRA.
MR. LANDRY:

12

Which we believe would be guaranteed under

14

Now, the

not a violation of this Title, as far as I know.

think that it that it's discipline.

5

MR. LANDRY:

And breaking someone's leg is
Unless you

We don't -- we -- we believe that might be

6

stretching the concept of discipline too far, if it is not a

7

traditional form of discipline of some sort.

8

9

QUESTION:

But if you don't stretch it all the way then

your -- then your strongest argument for stretching it at all

10

is gone, that somehow this section has to be self contained

11

and every possible infringement of the right of the union

12

member has to be punishable under this Title and nowhere else.

13

It seems to me you are acknowledging that there are some that

14

are not punishable under this Title.

15

MR. LANDRY:

Well, it — if we are going to use the

16

word discipline as a way of distinguishing activity, perhaps

17

the Court could make infringements -- make any of this

18

activity actionable as an infringement under 101(a)(2) and

19

102, or actionable under 102.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Landry, may I ask you a question about

your duty of fair representation claim?

maladministration?

2

MR. LANDRY:

We believe that in the concept of

3

negligence under the decisions of the courts would not be

4

enough to constitute a duty of fair representation.

5

we have alleged arbitrary discriminatory conduct without —

6

QUESTION:

However,

So, are you saying that part of your

7

allegation in count 1 is intentional discrimination against

8

your client?

9

MR. LANDRY:

We believe a fair reading of that would

10

indicate it's intentional.

11

conduct should be enough to rise to duty of fair

12

representation -- breach of a duty of fair representation.

13

said that the duty is implied in the strongest possible sense.

2

It is implied, this Court said in the Emporium case, from the

3

very nature of the union's right of exclusive representation

4

when it is chosen by a majority.

5

the Foust case, it is inseparable from that duty.

6

Or, as this Court said in

The reason for that, we think, is clear.

When these

7

statutes, the Railway Labor Act and the NLRA, were enacted

they operated to take away from minorities and from the

questions might rise to issues of equal protection or due

enforceability of this basic duty should not be left to the

Moreover, and I think this goes perhaps to a question

asked earlier by Justice O'Connor, the scope of the duty of

be broader than the ability of the Board to enforce certain

provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.

18

The union has argued very forcefully in its brief for

the proposition that some forms of arbitrary treatment do not

fall under the unfair labor practice provisions of the act.

The Labor Board, of course, disagrees with that position.

kind that this Court so vigorously condemned only three years

N,

1

the duty of fair representation claim and to seek to convince

2

the Court that that claim, as the lower courts have stated, is

3

— is badly founded.

4

I think that it is most helpful to begin by noting what

5

Congress has done with regard to hiring halls.

This is not a

6

subject as to -- which has escaped legislative attention.

7

no matter how this case comes out, and no matter what the duty

8

of fair representation is determined to encompass,

individuals like Mr. Breininger who claim, at least in the

)

The most contentious issue, in 1947 when Congress was

17

considering a question of how unions which are parties to

18

collective bargaining relationships should be regulated, was

19

the subject of the closed shop, the requirement that to be

20

hired you had to be a union member, and most particularly, the

21

closed shop in connection with the hiring hall.

22

was of the dimension of the debate we are having today over

23

the scope of the capital gains tax.

24

fought out in public and not in private, that gripped the

25

national attention, that caused rallies, vetoes and the like.

That debate

It was an issue that was

1

And Congress came to a conclusion on -- on that issue.

2

And the conclusion was that where unions have an active role

3

in the hiring process they should be subject to the same norms

4

as employers, same NLRA norms as employers who are engaged in

5

the hiring process.

6

makes plain, that is the gravamen of the 8(b)(2) offense, and

7

Congress was operating against the background of well settled

8

law that an employer in making a hiring decision violated the

9

NLRA if and only if he acted on the basis of the union

10
11

And as the language of Section 8(b)(2)

considerations.
It seems to us that the essence of the matter in terms

12

of what the statute tells us in terms is the following.

That

13

if an employer and a union bargain in a way which ends up in

14

the employer doing the hiring, under the NLRA there is a

15

violation if and only if the employer refuses hire on the

16

basis of union considerations.

17

union bargain in a way which provides that an outside agency,

18

a third party, an employment agency, makes the hiring

19

decision, the same rule obtains.

And if the employer and the

20

The argument here is that if the employer and the union

21

bargain and the determination is made that the union will have

22

an active role in the hiring process, there is a different

23

standard, as Justice Stevens indicated, that the standard

24

would be the one drawn from the duty of fair representation

25

and would be -- would stretch beyond alleged wrongs based on

union consideration to claims that the union didn't have

2

specific -- sufficiently specific rules, which would not be a

3

violation for the employer, that the union had rules which it

4

didn't follow, to the detriment of people who were union

5

members and were close to the administration, and so on.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, am I correct in understanding that

7

the other side of that coin is that you would agree that if

8

the allegations in count 2 were included in count 1, namely

9

that the unfair use of the — alleged unfair use of the hiring

10

clause — hiring hall, was for retaliation against some kind

11

of activity, that would allege a violation of the duty of fair

12

representation?

13

MR. GOLD:

No.

We are arguing that that would allege a

14

good unfair labor practice claim.

15

whether that kind of unfair labor practice claim, which under

16

normal rules would go only to the National Labor Relations

17

Board, also states a good claim of a breach of the duty of

18

fair representation.

19

And the question here is

To go back to what I said about the employer.

If an

20

individual walks into court and says the employer is —

refused to hire me because I am a union member, and he has the

facts to demonstrate that, he cannot go to court.

10

That's an implied

Obviously, that is not a situation in

11

And it is also settled that where the union is the

question is one that we have to face up to, because we are
saying that in that situation there would be no NLRA-based

in administering grievance and arbitration systems, the union
would be subject to both an NLRA claim and a Title VII claim.

which encourages or discourages union membership, and this

Court, in a series of cases, has said that you have to show

that there was a union consideration that is on the base.

easy way of looking at it is if an employer said I will only

He would be subject to a Title VII claim.

And we are saying that in this one situation where the

party that bargained things out and the employer said you will

stand in my shoes in the hiring decision, that Congress

decided that the rules would be the same.

11

situations where the union is not standing in the employer's

shoes, is not taking the employer's active role in making

hiring decisions, we can't make this equation between what

employers can do under 8(a)(3) and what unions can do as

Now, in other

3

MR. GOLD:

That's -- yeah, I mean, it is the -- it is

4

the union, it would be — it is certainly possible, but it

5

would be paradoxical for Congress to say that, whereas in 1946

6

the individual had no right against the employer for his

7

direct action in refusing to hire, if the employer and the

8

union reach an agreement which -- which says the union will

9

act for me from now on, there ought to be a new norm.

Nothing

10

has been taken away from the employee in that situation.

11

After all, where the union is bargaining with the employer

12

over what the — the contract terms will be, it can be said,

13

as Vaca says, that the employees have lost something.

14

Where the union is dealing with a grievance and the

15

individual says I have a contract right vis a vis the

16

employer, and the union is the only means through which I can

17

vindicate that, through the grievance arbitration system, and

18

the union acts arbitrarily, in those situations you have the

Our counterargument is that the Court, in implying

about the unfair labor practice, and this Court extends the

Correct.

Yes.

And, there's no allegation

I — I -- I think in part it's a

recognition that there are some problems with the allegation

that there was retaliation for union activity here, but in

12

part it was that the complaint would look like, walk like and

13

smell like an 8(b)(2) if the statement was that the union

14

should incur NLRA liability in a judicial forum for

15

discriminating on the basis of union conduct.

1

MR. GOLD:

What is water over the dam, as far as we are

2

concerned, is that there is a duty of fair representation.

3

And that it applies in situations in which the union is acting

4

in a way that no employer does.

5

therefore no water and no dam, that states what the limit of

6

the duty of fair representation is.

7

this ought to be a limit, that when you look at the whole

8

statute which you are elaborating through a process of

9

implication, that it is a mistake to -- to define the duty of

But there is no case, and

And we're arguing that

10

fair representation so broadly that it duplicates the

11

particular coverage that Congress intended with regard to the

12

regulation of hiring decisions under the NLRA, and indeed

13

overpowers the rule that Congress, after the most contentious

14

debate, arrived at with regard to when a hiring decision is a

15

violation of Title VII as opposed to -- I mean, of the

16

National Labor Relations Act as opposed to a violation of some

17

other claim.

18

What is at issue here is both the proper tribunal for

19

determining the validity of NLRA hiring decisions, which,

20

overwhelmingly before this late-blooming theory, have been

21

handled by the National Labor Relations Board.

22

QUESTION:

And —

Mr. Gold, I take it, by virtue of your focus

23

exclusively on the NLRA aspect of the argument, that you are

24

not so concerned then about the fact that there may be a

MR. GOLD:

I wanted to, glancing up at the clock, turn

to that.

of the nature of the claim that was actually made, the nature

5

of the question that —

6

QUESTION:

9

We are equally concerned, but we just feel much

Do you think there is a Section 102 claim

made on the face of the complaint?
MR. GOLD:

No.

The complaint — let me just say

something very quickly about the structure of the Landrum-

10

Grif fin Act.

11

101(a)(2), which safeguards member free speech.

12

another provision in Section 101(a)(5) which prevents

13

discipline without due process, or the imposition of union

14

penalties without due process, hearing and so on.

15

gives individuals a cause of action for a breach of either

16

101(a)(2), the free speech provision, or 101(a)(5), and

17

Section 609, as this Court said in Finnegan v. Leu, which has

18

been referred to here, in essence replicates, and for the

19

purposes of this case, is parallel to Section 102.

20

The Landrum-Griffin Act has a provision, Section
It has

Section 102

The only claim made in the complaint, the only question

21

raised in the petition for certiorari, concerns Section

101(a)(5), the due process provision, and Section 609.

23

is no reference to Section 101(a)(2).

24

it's not here.

1

rights or status as a member of the union are all that is

2

covered by Section 101(a)(5) and Section 609.
So we think the lower court was plainly correct on this

3
4

Court's precedence with regard to the Landrum-Griffin claim.

5

To say that a job referral out of a non exclusive hiring hall

6

is an incident of membership, when the union can't limit the

7

use of the hiring hall only to members, and doesn't purport

8

to, is no more sensible than to say that discharge from a

9

union position, an appointed union position, is discipline.

10

And the Court sguarely, of course, has rejected the latter of

11

those two propositions.
I want to say something, too, about the practicalities

12

13

of this.

What really is affected here is whether you have to

14

go through a due process system in administering a hiring

15

hall.

16

union decision, A is referred rather than B, is a form of

17

discipline to B.

18

charge on B for not having worked as long as A, or for any

19

other claim.

20

Court to say or do implicates the question of whether somebody

21

who pleads 101(a)(2) states and says that one of the ways that

22

the union retaliated against him for exercising free speech is

23

job related, doesn't have a good claim -- cause of action.

24

That is just not here.

25

was never pled; it was never litigated.

The theory of the Petitioner in this case is that any

And therefore, that you have to serve a

So, in sum, we say that insofar as the Petitioner here

claims that the union acted against him based on the fact that

he was a "antagonistic" or bad union member, somebody who the
