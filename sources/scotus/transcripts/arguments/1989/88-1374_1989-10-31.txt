ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. McCONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In Walz v. Tax Commission this Court observed that the

13

their potential than the hazards of government supporting

At issue are sermons that have been preached from the

20

pulpit and then presented both in printed form and in the form

21

of tapes, religious books, such as the Life-Changing Prayer

1

California is the first state to assert the authority

2

to tax materials of this sort.

3

sales and use taxes came into widespread use, these

4

specifically religious activities and transactions have

5

consistently been held to be immune from taxation.

6

part this is because of the decisions of this Court and the

7

trilogy of cases in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, Jones v. Opelika,

8

and Follett v. McCormick, which held that the dissemination of

. 9

religious materials by itinerant and other evangelists for the

10

purpose of communicating their message is exempt even from

11

generally applicable taxes on other commercial vendors.

14

QUESTION:

Since the 1930s and '40s, when

Now,

in

There you were dealing with a flat license

tax, were you not, Mr. McConnell?
MR. McCONNELL:

That is right, Mr. Chief Justice, but

15

the point of the decisions is that that flat license tax in

16

the context of individual itinerant evangelists amounted to a

17

very serious burden on their ability to communicate the

18

message.

19

in this case, although not flat,

20

substantial burden on the — on the communication of the

21

materials under the circumstances today, not —

22

It's our position, Mr. Chief Justice, that the tax

QUESTION:

is similarly a serious,

Well, Mr. McConnell, what is the evidence

23

that the imposition of the ordinary sales tax,

I guess it is

24

around 6 percent, would burden the Petitioner?

I assume the

25

tax is passed on,

is it not, to the purchaser?

Justice O'Connor, the tax can be passed

QUESTION:

That is the norm in — when sales tax is

opposed — imposed, is it not?

5

MR. McCONNELL:

It is the norm, but, Justice O'Connor,

6

don't get me wrong.

7

the religious organization itself necessarily has to pay the

tax.

QUESTION:

And you may say that 6 percent is not

Is there any indication that sales are

reduced by virtue of the imposition of the tax?

14

MR. McCONNELL:

Justice O'Connor, the — it's almost a

15

golden, an iron rule of economics that when the price of

16

something is increased the number of sales are going to go

17

down.

18

this tax that makes it particularly troubling to religious

19

organizations is not so much the 6 percent, or 6.5 or 7 --

20

remember there are three different rates in California, but

21

the — but the almost impossible administrative difficulty of

22

dealing with the varying and changing rates of tax in some

23

7,000 taxing jurisdictions around the country.

24

in this case shows that the difficulty of dealing with that

25

kind of a burden is something that only the largest ministries

But, in addition to that, the very — the aspect of

And the record

could possibly deal with.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. McConnell, I assume that there is no

3

more — maybe I shouldn't assume it.

4

to convey a religious message than there is to receive it?

5

MR. MCCONNELL:

6

QUESTION:

Is there any more right

No, Your Honor.

Well, we held — we held last term, if I

7

recall correctly, that a state not only could impose a tax

8

upon the sale of bibles, but indeed had to impose a tax upon

9

the sale of bibles if it imposed a tax upon the sale of other

10

books.

11

it, is that the seller was not an itinerant or non-itinerant

12

preacher, but was, as far as the facts of the case were

13

involved, a regular bookstore.

14

the principle you are urging upon us here?

15

And the only difference in that case, as I understand

MR. McCONNELL:

Now, why wouldn't that violate

Two reasons, Justice Scalia.

First of

16

all, when an ordinary commercial bookstore is selling a bible

17

simply for profit, it is not doing so for the purpose of

18

communicating a particular religious philosophy.

19

QUESTION:

No, but I am buying it for that purpose.

20

MR. McCONNELL:

21

QUESTION:

That may —

And you acknowledged that I have as much

22

right to receive a religious message as someone else has to

convey it.

25

So long as I want to buy it for my own religious

1

to do with the longstanding relationship between religious

2

institutions and the government, under which religious

3

institutions are both immune and exempt from various forms of

4

regulation and taxation, and also ineligible for subsidies and

5

other forms of support.

6

government must leave religious organizations alone insofar as

7

they are engaged in the dissemination of religious materials.

8

When B. Dalton sells a bible, it is not — it is not part of

9

that tradition.

10
11

QUESTION:

The principle here is that the

Well, do you say, Mr. McConnell, that the

government must exempt churches from real property taxation?
MR. McCONNELL:

12

I think it would be a mistake for this

13

Court to try to paint with too broad a brush.

14

have very different impacts.

15

QUESTION:

Various taxes

Well, but I think it is you who are painting

«

16

with a broad brush, when you say that the government must

17

simply stay away from all religions, and I got the

18

implication, perhaps not tax any aspect of them.

19

MR. McCONNELL:

What I mean by that, Mr. Chief Justice,

20

is that the government must leave the churches alone in their

21

dissemination of religious doctrine and in their worship

22

activities.

23

would come out if the state or local government were to —

24

were to abolish the exemptions that have existed throughout

25

our constitutional history, but this Court in Follett, and in

I don't know how, ultimately, a property tax

— and in Murdock, indicated that there might well be a

2

distinction.

3

context of personal, not real, property taxes that there is a

4

distinction.

5

And several lower courts have held in the

And if I might inform the Court of the distinction that

6

those courts have found, there, the principle is — is that

7

property is not itself a religious act, that the Free Exercise

8

Clause is concerned with the exercise of religion, that is,

9

the actual transmission of religious doctrine and the worship

10

of religion.

11

be used in the course of that is one step removed.

12

something that might be useful for the exercise of religion,

13

maybe even necessary in some cases, but it is not the act of

14

religion itself.

Property — the ownership of property that might

contributions, that is one thing.

This is just a tax when you sell religious

MR. McCONNELL:

And the state is

But if you sell something,

First of all, Justice Scalia, it is not

clear that there is a quid pro quo in the sense that — and

23

that the record shows that it is a policy of Appellant to

distribute these materials, whether they receive the price or

25

not.

9

of the message.

10

The two sides of this transaction are on

And on the other hand, the

The — the monetary aspect of the

As this Court quite clearly held in Murdock, the fact

11

that money changes hands in the course of the transaction does

12

not transform this religious practice, which is of millennia,

13

literally millennia old, into a purely commercial transaction.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. McConnell, the Court certainly sustained

15

in Lee a rather substantial burden on the exercise of

16

peligion.

17

burden in Lee, which the Court upheld?

18

Do you think this imposes a greater burden than the

MR. McCONNELL:

Greater, but most importantly, very

19

different.

The tax that was upheld in Lee was a tax upon

20

secular employment by a farmer, by farmers working in

21

agricultural labor.

22

They objected to the Social Security system because of their

23

religious tenets, and therefore believed that they should not

24

have to pay the tax.

25

anything about the tenets or doctrines of the ministries that

Their objection to the tax was its use.

We are not contending that there is

QUESTION:

It is the fact of being a

Well, it would seem to me that would be,

that would be an even stronger claim than yours, would it not?
MR. McCONNELL:

Well, I don't think so, Justice

6

O'Connor, because the separation of church and state has to do

7

with the institutional relationship between religious

8

organizations and government.

9

upon the particular ecclesiology or view of church/state

It doesn't hinge upon whether,

10

relations that any individual church organization has.

11

goes back to the basic principle that James Madison advocated

12

and that this Court has come back to in case after case, which

13

is that the civil jurisdiction has no cognizance over the —

14

over the practice of religion.

15

for all religions and not just — not just those with

16

particular tenets.

QUESTION:

And that is going to hold true

Do you think that a general sales tax can be

imposed on the sale of newspapers?
MR. McCONNELL:

imposed upon profit making corporations in the sale of

newspapers.

If by that you are asking whether the cost of

2

the materials exceeds the revenue directly from that — the

3

record is — is not very clear on the point.

4

however, you will find of the Form 990, the federal income tax

5

returns from the ministries, which indicate that insofar as

6

you are looking specifically at the — at the pure sales, the

a pure sale, that in fact the materials, the cost of the

QUESTION:

Mr. McConnell, did I understand you to say a

16

moment ago, or perhaps to suggest, that the government could

17

not tax a nonprofit corporation which published a newspaper?

18

MR. McCONNELL:

The Court — I was in a sense

19

summarizing the Court's holdings.

In Breard v. Alexandria,

20

the Court confronted the question of sales by a profit-making

21

magazine distributor, and this was shortly, this was just ten

22

years after Murdock, and the Court distinguished between for

23

profit businesses and non-commercial businesses — non­

24

commercial speakers in the context of disseminating their

25

messages.

1

I don't really know what a nonprofit newspaper would be

2

like, but if, for example, you might be referring to a

3

political organization that would be distributing, let's say

4

the Sierra Club might sell a book, not just for the purpose of

5

making money on it, but because it contains information that

6

they want to get out to the public, I think that is a

7

difficult question, but —

8

QUESTION:

What is difficult about it?

9

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, it is difficult because the

10

Sierra Club is not a religious organization and there is no

11

requirement of separation between the government and what the

12

Sierra Club is doing.

13

direct subsidy to the Sierra Club to produce and disseminate

Whereas, I think that most other non-commercial

organizations could.

3

under the Free Speech Clause, I don't know, but those issues

4

are not — if so, those issues are not being raised here.

Whether there might be some argument

5

The key, the key point that I would like to emphasize

6

here is that it is simply not the case in our constitutional

7

tradition that religious organizations are to be treated the

8

same way as commercial book sellers, or even as other

9

nonprofit organizations.

That has not been the case for 200

10

years, and the reason is that the obligations of separation,

11

of a division of the spheres of authority, and those with

12

respect to religion and government, that that has been kept,

13

that has been kept carefully apart by the First Amendment and

14

by the practices of the states in compliance with the First

15

Amendment and their own constitutions in the years since then

16

That this tradition is different from the tradition

17

ascribed to commercial businesses, and it has to be that way.

Because the government is able to regulate, and indeed even

19

put out of business, an ordinary commercial business.

than any limit, any remaining tinges of substantive due

process that there might be in the economic sphere,

22

essentially the government can do what it wants with

commercial businesses.

organizations.

requirement of the Constitution is that the government keep

its hands off.

doctrine, but it does not have the authority to — to tax them

6

QUESTION:

It may not help them; it cannot assist them or

That is not really true, Mr. McConnell, and

7

maybe there are those of us who think some of the cases

8

suggest going too far in both directions, both in prohibiting

9

non-discriminatory assistance and in — and in prohibiting

10

non-discriminatory taxation.

So why can't it apply a non-discriminatory

MR. McCONNELL:

This Court has carefully distinguished

between various forms of municipal services that indirect —-

on a general and completely neutral basis.
Take, for example, the Court's recent decision in Bowen

2

3

against Kendrick, in which religious organizations were

4

allowed to participate in — in the adolescent family life act

5

programs.

6

none of those organizations participating in that could be

7

permitted to use any of that money, or even their own money in

8

the course of the program, to disseminate religious doctrine

9

in the course of administering that.

But this Court held, and I believe rightly, that

Even though — even

though secular organizations are being treated perfectly

equally, religious organizations are under a special

MR. McCONNELL:

QUESTION:

4

.

Well, Justice Stevens —

I mean, the subsidy is an establishment

problem.
MR. McCONNELL:

That is right, but subsidy and penalty

5

are two sides of the same coin, just as free exercise and

6

establishment are two sides of the same coin.

7

is one of separate jurisdictions, that — and I'm going — I'm

8

referring now, again, to James Madison's original formulation

9

of this theory in his Memorial and Remonstrance, which this

10

Court has referred to dozens of times in explicating the, the

11

religion clauses.

12

does not have authority over religion, whether to subsidize it

QUESTION:

The point is that the civil jurisdiction

But I think you acknowledged that if you had

16

sales, say you sell sacramental wine or vestments or something

MR. NIELSEN:

Starting with the question about the

2

middle of the page, where it says if they ask for the item and

3

you know the price of the item, could you break that out.

4

response was if they use the order form, those that use the

5

order form we could.

6

their internal records, they have segregated sales of tangible

7

personal property from donations.

So the evidence is that, with respect to

The next question was, and those that did not use the
order form, what was the procedure.

The response is, the

10

procedure that the organization followed was that it was

charged to a donation.

not clear as to what amount was being given for tangible

13

personal property, they charge it to donation.

I thought Mr. McConnell's point was that the

the thing as it cost them.

California, in its 1946

So, I believe as long as there is not a constitutional,

QUESTION:

2

On that point, may I just ask you, do you

agree with your opponent that this is really the first time

that this particular kind of levy has been imposed by a state?

5

If it is, it is kind of strange to say it is going to destroy

your revenue resources not to be able to do something nobody

7

else has ever done.

8

MR. NIELSEN:

9

Well, I think the analogy in this case is

that made in Lee, that it is not — the impact of having to

10

create forced exemptions, whether it is for this basis or for

11

other basis, will hinder the system.

13

that we have been in this business for a couple hundred years,

and the systems have gotten along perfectly well without ever

— with just precisely the kind of exemption he is asking for

here.

17

MR. NIELSEN:

Well, in other states that is possibly

18

true, but in California it has held since 1930 that sales of

specifically by the legislature, are taxable.

tracts in their vestibules or that sell candles or other

MR. NIELSEN:

Do you know that they have?

I have no reason to believe they are not.

We — California makes the best compliance effort as possible

This potential for discrimination has been disfavored by this

the state of taxing religious articles goes back to the '30s

or the '40s, but, as we have cited in our brief, the — an

official opinion of the state attorney general issued in 1980

5

there is some difference of opinion between the Board of

Equalization and the state attorney general, but at least his

opinion, upon which we relied during the tax period, would

seem to stand as some kind of an authoritative statement of

Now, I gather that

I might add that after the administrative proceeding in

11

this case, a different appellant court and a different
