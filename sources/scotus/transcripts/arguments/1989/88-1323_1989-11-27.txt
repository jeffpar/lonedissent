The regulations authorize the Secretary of -Health and

Human Services to add together or net multiple past errors

in the amount of benefits paid to an individual up to the

time that the Secretary discovers that an error has been

made.

12

instances mentioned in this litigation where the Secretary

13

has been —perhaps we should say tardy — in taking action

14

on overpayments of which he was aware.

15

QUESTION:

There are a few

Do you think it would be a violation of the

16

regulations if the Secretary were to do what amicus says is

17

done sometimes?

18

MS. WAX:

Well,

I think it might be — I'm not sure

19

which regulation it would violate for the Secretary to do

20

that because there is no regulation that sets forth a time

21

limit between detection or suspicion of an overpayment and

22

what we call determination of an overpayment.

23

But our policy and our practice,

which we

feel

is

24

entitled to a presumption of regularity, is to take no more

25

time than is necessary between the time that the Secretary

2

error to the point where he's in the position to demand

overpayment.

4

QUESTION:

But there is no regulation requiring prompt

5

action.

6

this sort of problem?

7

What recourse would a recipient have faced with

MS. WAX:

Your Honor, respectfully, we don't think that

8

a class action that facially challenges the validity of our

netting regulation as inconsistent with the statute would

10

be the vehicle in which to challenge what an individual

QUESTION:

Ms. Wax, I assume that tardiness, that just

waiting, is not a very intelligent policy for the Secretary.

18

I mean, he can't use it intentionally to do harm unless he's

QUESTION:

Yes, but — may I

just interrupt you.

Do

2

you think that common-law authority survives the statutory

3

provision that no adjustment shall be made without providing

for the -- you know, of an overpayment unless you have the

opportunity to forgive part of it?

6
7
8

How

does

the

common-law

survive

that

statutory

enactment?
MS. WAX:

Well, we think it survives for two reasons.

9

First of all, as this Court has noted in the cases I've just

10

mentioned, because there is such a strong presumption that

11

the government can do common-law setoff, there needs to be

12

a very explicit congressional expression of intent to limit

13

that right or cut it off.

14

QUESTION:

What

could

be

than

the subchapter and so forth?

MS. WAX:

QUESTION:

19

MS. WAX:

Well, we think that —
That's pretty explicit.
— when those terms are looked at in their

Yes, essentially we have because we have made

the fact that the enforcement of the lower court's order

The plain language of 404(a)(1) provides whenever the

Secretary finds that more or less than the correct amount

of payment has been made to any person, proper adjustment

Again, this broad language is used which says whenever

the Secretary finds an incorrect payment and, furthermore,

the words "adjustment and recovery" are broad terms which

finds that more than the correct amount of payment has been

there are other provisions in the

calculation of the correct amount of payment is determined

on a monthly basis.

that Title II is a monthly program, and 42 U.S.C. 1382(c)(1)
