ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD SHERMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHERMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue presented here is whether a state can

11
12

exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident

13

defendant who was personally served while present in the

14

state if that defendant does not otherwise have sufficient

15

contacts with the state to satisfy the minimum contacts

16

test announced in International Shoe.

17

The issue arises in the following context.

The

18

parties lived virtually all their married lives in New

19

Jersey.

20

about ages 2 and 8 at the time, and they entered into a

21

marital settlement agreement resolving everything in New

22

Jersey.

23

The split up in 1987.

They had two children

The wife then moved to California with the

24

children, as planned, and husband filed for dissolution in

25

New Jersey and asked the court to incorporate their

1

marital settlement agreement.

2

Burnham with his petition, she filed an action in

3

California for legal separation and filed him after he

4

brought the children back from visiting with them to her

5

home in Mill Valley, California.

6

Before he served Mrs.

Mr. Burnham moved to quash service arguing that

7

he did not have sufficient minimum contacts under Kulko,

8

International Shoe and similar cases and that under this

9

Court's decision in Shaffer v. Heitner the fact that he

10

was served in California was no longer relevant at all.

11

The trial court initially agreed with Mr.

12

Burnham and granted his motion, in part holding that there

13

were not sufficient minimum contacts and there was no

14

personal jurisdiction.

15

Mrs. Burnham's attorney convinced it that the fact that he

16

was served in the forum was sufficient and that

17

notwithstanding what this Court held in Shaffer and the

18

language in Shaffer, personal service is still sufficient.

It reconsidered that order when

19

The court of appeal denied the petition for a

20

writ in a decision which, again, said that Shaffer, the

21

language in Shaffer, had not changed the traditional rule

22

— it goes by the nickname of transient jurisdiction.

23

relied on cases such as the Supreme Court's case in

24

Nevada, Cariaga which had said this Court has never

25

directly held that transient jurisdiction is no good so we

It

1

will apply it until we are instructed otherwise.
We're here today to ask you to instruct the

2

3

courts of this land otherwise, to give effect to what the

4

Court said in Shaffer, that personal jurisdiction in all

5

cases must be tested by the minimum contacts test.

6

Now, it's important to keep in mind that

7

although the doctrine is often called transient

8

jurisdiction or sometimes, more colorfully, gotcha

9

jurisdiction, what's really at issue is not whether the

10

defendant is passing through momentarily.

11

is whether the fact of service on a defendant while he is

12

in the forum is alone sufficient.

What's at issue

The traditional view that it was founded on the

13
14

notion that -- what jurisdiction is all about, what

15

personal jurisdiction is all about is whether the state

16

has power over the defendant, physical power over the

17

defendant.

18

view, when a defendant is within its boundaries.

And it does, according to the traditional

19

That view was long criticized by the

20

commentators and was rejected by this Court in

21

International Shoe and then again in Shaffer.

22

physical power over the defendant is not fundamentally the

23

basis for the exercise of state court jurisdiction.

24
25

QUESTION:

that some minimum contact is necessary for personal

And it's

important to distinguish —

I would have thought so and that

some business or to visit there might well meet whatever

MR. SHERMAN:

That — that —

On that — on those facts, yes.

MR. SHERMAN:

1

But the question that your

2

hypothetical poses is what kinds of contacts would be

3

sufficient under the minimum contacts test for somebody

4

who was not in the state very long.

5

that would depend upon applying the minimum contacts test

6

and typically the cause of action has to be related to or

7

rise out of contacts that the defendant has.
And in your example, for instance, if somebody

8

9

And the answer to

is — is in the state transacting some business, even

10

though they are there very briefly, if there is a cause of

11

action that the plaintiff has against that defendant that

12

arises out of his transacting that business, there's no

13

question that under the minimum contacts test —

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Sherman —

15

MR. SHERMAN:

16

QUESTION:

— there would be a restriction.

This sort of points out -- points up

17

one of the problems with -- with abandoning the gotcha

18

test.

19

that it made very simple the preliminary question of

20

jurisdiction, which ought to be simple, it being a

21

preliminary question.

22

One of the nice things about the gotcha test was

It's very silly to have to litigate about that

23

and what you're saying is by abandoning the gotcha test

24

we're going to have to look in every single case to see

25

whether the individual is not only served -- or -- or the

1

state courts will -- not only whether the individual was

2

served there but whether the suit pertains to his presence

3

there and so forth.

4

It's a big deal.

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, Your Honor, if there were no

5

Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and we didn't

6

have to worry about due process and we're looking for an

7

easy test, then that might be an easy test that a court

8

would want to —

9
10

QUESTION:

But for 200 years --

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, that's true.

It's been

11

around for a long time.

12

around for a long time too and this Court said in Shaffer

13

that it was fundamentally unfair and did not comport with

14

the Fourteenth Amendment and, notwithstanding its lineage,

15

it was consigned to the dustbin of judicial history.

16

QUESTION:

But quasi in rem jurisdiction was

Well, easy tests are not unrelated to

17

the due process clause.

predictability.

19

without thinking about — in terms of jurisdiction or in

20

rem or in personam, that if you're within the borders of a

21

state, you're subject to that state.

22

There's a high degree of

I think many lay people understand,

MR. SHERMAN:

That's all.

I think what most people would

23

think is if you're within the borders of the state, you're

24

subject to the power, if you will, of the state.

be sued on them.

And if a cause of action arises out of those

5

But if you are in the state for reasons which do

6

not give rise to the cause of action that is sued on, then

I don't think you would expect to be subject to a lawsuit

over them, which is what happened in this case.

That's true.

15

That's true.

QUESTION:

And International Shoe I thought

seemed to recognize the validity of the so-called gotcha.

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, I think there's kind of been

17

a mistaken understanding of what that phrase meant.

18

courts — not this Court because it hasn't addressed it,

19

obviously, but the state courts that have addressed it —

have looked at International Shoe and have said if — the

language there, if the defendant be not present in the

MR. SHERMAN:

I think it overturned the

theoretical underpinning of Pennoyer when it said that

power was no longer the basis of jurisdiction.

6

that was in the context of out-of-state defendants, but

the reasoning of the decision was to reject the notion

that power was the basis of jurisdiction.

That's why you

If power is not the basis for jurisdiction, then

Well, I don't know enough about

criminal law to give the best answer to that.

QUESTION:

7

MR. SHERMAN:

But you —
But my off-the-cuff answer would

8

be that although the state may have the power, because

9

it's given the right to do so by this Court, to arrest the

10

defendant and to ship him back to the other state,

11

extradite him, that the analogy in the civil case would be

12

that if the defendant is served in the law -- in the

13

forum, that the state then can shift the lawsuit — should

shift the lawsuit back to the original -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

2

MR. SHERMAN:

3

That's right.

You —

But the purpose of arresting

him —

4

QUESTION:

But your power to do it is based

5

entirely on the fact that he's -- he happens to be passing

through the state.

QUESTION:

12

13

That's true, but —

But the —

— or any less unfair than what you

say.
MR. SHERMAN:

But the consequence of your

14

hypothetical is that the defendant winds up being tried in

15

the state of origin.

16

QUESTION:

Well, that's true.

17

MR. SHERMAN:

18

QUESTION:

But —

And the analogy —

— there's a legal proceeding in the

19

state of arrest, namely, the extradition hearing and he

20

might conceivably win there.

21

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, but in the civil case the

22

analogy would be there's a civil proceeding in California

23

and he is served in California and then he makes his

24

motion to quash for lack of jurisdiction, and it's

25

granted, and the case then goes back to New Jersey.

1

QUESTION:

MR. SHERMAN:

3

Yeah, but I don't know why he —
Because he doesn't have

4

QUESTION:

I don't know why the criminal —

5

MR. SHERMAN:

QUESTION:

-- contacts —

— defendant wouldn't be entitled to

7

have his motion granted also on your theory.

I don't know

8

why — because the only thing — the only basis for

9

jurisdiction over him is he happened to be there.

10

Well, anyway, that's a different case, I guess.

11

It seems to me it's a stronger case than — well, anyway,

12

go ahead.
MR. SHERMAN:

13

There's no more I can say about

that.
15
16

question for a moment about a bright-line rule and point

17

out that things are (a) not so simple even under Pennoyer

18

because even under Pennoyer, with respect to out-of-state

19

defendants, in order to allow there to be jurisdiction

20

over out-of-state defendants all kinds of fictions and

21

exceptions were created in — post-Pennoyer, like in Hess.

22

•

I'd like to advert back to Justice Scalia's

I mean, if you drive in the state, you would

23

(inaudible) consent that the registrar of motor vehicles

24

is your agent for service of process.

25

all kinds of exceptions that were created.

I mean, there are

It was not

1

simple prior — under the Pennoyer regime.

2

Now, if it were —

3

QUESTION:

It's clear that one way you — you

4

can place the jurisdiction in the case just beyond doubt

5

is you serve the individual in the jurisdiction.

6

yeah, there are a lot of refinements as to other ways that

7

you may get him, but up until now you have known that.

8

One way to be sure, you serve him.

9

MR. SHERMAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SHERMAN:

I mean,

Well --

That — that would be gone?
That's true.

The second -- second

12

part of my answer to your question is that in Stanley v.

13

Illinois and in Shaffer this Court said that due process

14

should not be sacrificed for the sake of simplicity, that

15

the cost is too high.

16

said that quasi in rem jurisdiction, traditional though it

17

may be, and easy to apply though it may be, is not

18

consistent with fundamental notions of due process.

19

the fact that it's easy and simple and eliminates cost is

20

not sufficient for constitutional scrutiny.

21
22

QUESTION:

And Justice Marshall in Shaffer

And

Mr. Sherman, what do you think of the

amended restatement version of when jurisdiction applies?

23

MR. SHERMAN:

I think there are several problems

24

with it.

25

the traditional rule because it allows for exceptions.

It's obviously somewhat of an improvement over

3

However, I think there are three things wrong with it.
The first is that it starts from the notion that
the service —

4

QUESTION:

That there is jurisdiction?

5

MR. SHERMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SHERMAN:

There is jurisdiction.

It starts from that premise?
That's right.

And the basis for

8

that, I believe, is that the restaters were unwilling to

9

give up the notion that jurisdiction is fundamentally

10
11

based on power.
QUESTION:

Well, it struck me as maybe a pretty

12

good statement of what the rule might be.

13

that jurisdiction does attach unless it's just too

14

attenuated.

15

which might include the criminal case where otherwise

16

there will be no opportunity to arrest the defendant.

17

That unless —

And the notes refer to special circumstances

MR. SHERMAN:

That's true.

But in order to

18

accept it jurisprudentially I think this Court would have

19

to say that its prior decisions which indicated that

20

jurisdiction is not fundamentally based upon power are

21

incorrect, that in one sense jurisdiction is to be

22

continually based upon power although the defendant can

23

then show reasons why it shouldn't be exercised — then

24

jurisdiction will not be exercised.

really — this case really — is it really necessary in

Honor.

reviewing, refused to issue a petition — refused to grant

the petition for writ of mandate and compel the trial

court to quash the service because it held that service on

That is --

MR. SHERMAN:

It doesn't say that jurisdiction

16

was being upheld on the ground that he has sufficient

17

contacts under the minimum contacts test, and it couldn't

18

have because it was quite obvious that the trial court did

19

not ground jurisdiction on that basis, and it couldn't

20

have because under California law and under this Court's

21

decisions there are insufficient contacts as a matter of

22

law to uphold jurisdiction here for two reasons.

23

The first is that doing business in a state only

24

gives rise to jurisdiction under the traditional test, if

25

that's what the Court thought it was applying, or if

that's what this Court wanted to apply, for causes of

action here does not arise out of the business that Mr.

Burnham did in California.

And the cause of

5

The wife is seeking to invalidate a marital

6

settlement agreement that she executed in New Jersey.

7

That has nothing to do with the husband's contacts in

8

California.

9

Secondly, California has held in Modlin v.

10

Superior Court, which is in our briefs, that if a person,

11

a father, combines coming to a state to visit his children

12

with doing some business, the combination of those do not

MR. SHERMAN:

We'll resume the

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

In thinking about this matter over the lunch

8

hour it occurred to me that I ought to say that we're

9

really not asking this Court to do anything very radical.

10

Although it's true that the doctrine of transient

11

jurisdiction has been around for a long time, there has

12

been an evolution in the law which has pointed in the

13

direction of abolishing it.

14

In fact, in Shaffer at page 213 the Court said,

15

"We therefore conclude that all assertions of state court

16

jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards

17

set forth in International Shoe."

18

often.

19

That's been quoted very

However, there's a footnote to that sentence

20

which has not been quoted very often, and it says,

21

would not be fruitful for us to reexamine the facts of

22

cases decided on the rationales of Pennoyer and Harris to

23

determine whether jurisdiction might be sustained under

24

the standards we adopt today.

25

decisions are inconsistent with this standard, they are

"It

2

overruled.
So, already in Shaffer the Court had recognized

3

that the law was moving in the direction of being

4

concerned with fundamental fairness.

5

look at the old rule coming out of Pennoyer, it perhaps

6

was fair in 1877 to say that, since you can't get service

7

on the defendant outside the jurisdiction, if you're lucky

8

enough to catch him in the jurisdiction, well, you've

9

gotten him and you've got jurisdiction over him.

10

And I think if you

But after International Shoe liberalized the

11

degree to which you could get jurisdiction over the

12

defendant by service outside the forum, the rationale for

13

saying that you can get jurisdiction over him by serving

14

him in the forum was totally undercut.

15

Therefore, if you abolish the doctrine of

16

transient jurisdiction in this case, all you're doing is

17

kind of completing a trio of cases that started with

18

International Shoe, Shaffer and now this case.

19

Unless you do something to the doctrine of

20

transient jurisdiction, we're stuck with cases like Grace

v. MacArthur where you're served if you're flying over and

have no contacts.

I don't know of any legislature

8

that has seen fit to -- as a matter of fact, they've all

gone the other way, as California has, and enacted a long-

choose not to do it, too.
MR. SHERMAN:

And they have statutes which say

3

they may exercise jurisdiction to the full extent

4

permitted by the Constitution.

5

There's — there are two additional reasons why

6

— coming back to Justice O'Connor's question earlier

7

today — why I think the Court should not adopt the

8

restatement view if the Court is willing to abolish the

9

pure form of transient jurisdiction which makes everything

10
11

turn on service.
The first is that it would accomplish a shift in

12

the burden.

13

defendant objects to jurisdiction, it's the plaintiff that

14

has the burden of establishing a basis for jurisdiction.

15

Traditionally it's the plaintiff — when the

This would put the burden on the defendant to

16

disprove why -- to prove why there should not be

17

jurisdiction.

18

plaintiffs to lure defendants to the state and to serve

19

them, as happened in this case, in a way that would

20

interfere with other interests.

21

better if there was one standard that is consistently

22

applied in making the plaintiff establish jurisdiction.

23

Secondly, if you do the restatement view, the

And that would be an incentive for

And I think it would be

24

restatement says jurisdiction is served in the forum

25

unless otherwise unreasonable.

This Court would then have

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

1

to begin a process of deciding numerous cases to define

2

the parameters of what's reasonable and unreasonable under

3

the restatement test.

4

There's already a body of law from this Court

5

under the minimum contacts test defining what's reasonable

6

and unreasonable, and it would be much simpler for

7

everybody if that body of law was just engrafted on to all

8

assertions of state court jurisdiction.

9

Finally, I close my opening comments this

10

afternoon by saying that if the Court determines that the

11

rule has been around so long that we should keep it even

12

though it may have unfair results, it shouldn't be applied

13

in a case where somebody is served in the state while

14

they're visiting their children, which is what happened in

15

this case.

16

And the reason for that is fundamentally that in

17

Asahi this Court -- and in World-Wide Volkswagen this

18

Court made clear that one of the things to be considered

19

in determining whether or not a state is exercising

20

jurisdiction consistent with the Constitution is the

21

degree to which it impacts upon the shared substance and

22

policies of the states.

23

I don't think it's beyond question that the

24

share and substantive policy of the states in the area of

25

child custody visitation is to encourage families of

2

children after the divorce.

3

adversely by allowing transient jurisdiction in a case

4

where somebody is served while they're visiting their

5

children.

6

That policy will be impacted

Therefore, if the Court does not totally abolish

7

the rule and if the Court does not accept the restatement

8

formulation, or even if it does, one of the things that it

9

should say, it's unreasonable to allow jurisdiction to be

10

predicated upon service on somebody who is in the state

11

when they're seeing their children.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

In the opinions issued by this Court over the

been a clear trend toward relaxing limits on state court

American society that has taken place and which has been

3

It is ironic that in this case, today as we

stand on the threshold of the 21st century at a time when

5

technological progress in travel and communication has

resulted in a shrinking of our planet to the size of a

7

global village, and at a time when the citizens of this

8

country, more than at any other time in our history, are

9

more likely to travel across state borders with ease and

10

with increasing frequency, the petitioner is arguing for a

11

retraction of the permissible reach of state jurisdiction

12

and a categorical rule that presence within the boundaries

of a -- of the forum state should no longer provide the

basis for the exercise of state jurisdiction under any

circumstances.

this Court should say that the law has been that presence

It is true that there is an alternative basis,

if the Court chooses not to do that, to uphold this

decision.

here — the connection here is significant.

9

And that is, by pointing out that the contacts

I think it's important to point out that state
courts always have the right to decline the exercise of

10

jurisdiction.

11

case where that occurred was Kulko, where in fact the

12

California courts did decline to exercise jurisdiction and

13

this Court upheld that judgment on their part.

14

And in fact, probably the most relevant

In this case and in Kulko, of course you did not

have the actual presence of the defendant, and that is a

major distinguishing factor between the facts of this case

important differences as well between this case and the

facts in Kulko.

20

But there are additional

And perhaps the most important of those are the

21

fact that here both California and New Jersey have

22

carefully considered the propriety of those respective

23

states assuming jurisdiction in this matter not only on

24

the superior court level but on every level of the state

judicial system in both states.

And there is no conflict between the decisions

of those two states.

conclusions that California is an appropriate state to

assume jurisdiction in this case under the circumstances.

5

They both came to consistent

In addition to that, and in addition to the fact

that the husband was not physically present within

California in Kulko, here you have more substantial

contacts, more substantial connection between the

reasonable.

I think that the decisions issued by this Court

approach that the Court is taking toward the question of

evaluating the various interests and the other factors

that are involved in the case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Devereaux, the question presented

in the petition for cert, and on which I thought we had —

4

we had granted cert. and what I thought we were here to

decide or what you were here for us to decide, is this:

6

is service of process on a nonresident defendant while he

is physically present in the forum state a sufficient

8

basis by itself for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.

9

Now, you are inviting us to decide it not on --

10

this case not on this ground, but to decide whether in the

11

particular facts and circumstances of this particular

12

controversy there was enough contact.

13

an issue that's of sufficient national importance to have

— to have warranted the attention that this Court has

given to this case.

I thought what we accepted cert, on was whether

MR. DEVEREAUX:

the opportunity, to decide the case on alternative grounds

2

as well, one of which is the question of sufficient

3

connection or contacts, another of which is an evaluation

4

of California's interest as a state of domicile and the

interests of the wife and children in this case.
The Court, of course, has no obligation to

decide those issues and can limit its decision to the

8

issue of the continued viability of the presence basis.

But the — the case does involve — commend itself to

14

would like to take, those issues are available for a

decision.

16

They are in the

But if the Court desires to limit its decision

17

to the issue of whether or not the presence of the

18

defendant within the state and service of process upon him

19

while he was present continues to be a sufficient

20

jurisdictional basis, then my position is that the answer

21

to that is yes.

22

It has not only been — that principle has not

23

only been established in Pennoyer v. Neff, but it has in

24

fact been acknowledge by this Court in more modern

25

decisions, including International Shoe, where the Court

1

expressly acknowledged that the minimum contacts analysis

2

related to service outside the state where the defendant

3

was not present but at least by implication recognized

4

that if a defendant is present within the state, that is a

5

valid jurisdictional basis.

6

The O'Neill v. New York case was also an

7

application of the presence rule where the Court clearly

8

said, the defendant being present in Florida, Florida had

9

jurisdiction over him.

10

So that all I'm suggesting is that based on the

11

precedent established by this Court in more than one case

12

over the last 100-plus years, an upholding of the judgment

13

of the California courts can be accomplished simply by

14

recognizing that the rule continues to be in effect.

15

And I think it's particularly significant that

16

when the commentators argued that Shaffer v. Heitner

17

required at least a reevaluation of the presence rule, if

18

not an outright abolishing of it, the American Law

19

Institute did reexamine that rule and concluded that it

20

was not appropriate to abolish the rule but instead

21

retained the rule in a slightly modified version.

22

And I think this is an indication that the

23

presence rule is valid, it's not unfair and unreasonable

24

and it does lend certainty and predictability to the

25

jurisdictional equation.

to uphold the judgment of the California courts.

simply remand that part of the case to the court of appeal
