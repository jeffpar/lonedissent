CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Petrich.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS P. PETRICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

9

MR. PETRICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case for copyright infringement requires

11

the Court to reconcile a conflict between two competing

12

copyrights conferred under the same section, Section 24,

13

of the 1909 Copyright Act.

14

On the same essential facts of this case, both

15

the Second and the Ninth Circuits have reached very

16

different accommodations of these interests.

17

In this case, in 1942, a short story named, or

18

entitled Rear Window, was first written and copyrighted by

19

Cornell Woolrich in 1942.

20

In 1953, the actor Jimmy Stewart and the

21

director, Alfred Hitchcock, teamed up to form a production

22

company to make a motion picture based in part on that

23

short story.

24
25

They obtained a prior assignment from the author
of the short story, which gave them the right to make all

motion picture versions of the short story, and to

2

continue to exhibit those motion picture versions

3

throughout the life of the original or initial term of

4

copyright obtained by the short story author, as well as

5

any renewal term of that author.

MR. PETRICH:

That was an express assignment of the

It's reproduced

in the -QUESTION:

10

And if the author hadn't died, could

11

the assignee have exercised that right or would the author

12

have had to do so?

13

MR. PETRICH:

It has always been the law that

14

only the statutory successor named in the statute may

15

exercise the right.

16

QUESTION:

So this case would be the same, in

17

your view, if he had -- never had assigned the renewal

18

right?

19

MR. PETRICH:

No.

If he had not assigned the

20

renewal right, we would not claim that we had a right to

21

use the work during his renewal term.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, even if he had assigned it, you

couldn't exercise it.
MR. PETRICH:

We could not renew.

The law

provides that only the people named in the statute may

actually renew it.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. PETRICH:

4

Well, what if he didn't renew it?
Well, I misunderstood your

question.
If he did not renew it, the underlying story

5
6

would have gone into the public domain and anyone could

7

use the story.
In 1954, the film company created a motion

8

9

picture based on the story, adding new characters, new

10

incidents and new dialogue.

11

separately copyrighted under Section 7 of the 1909 act.

That motion picture was

In 1968, the author of the short story died and

12

13

his copyright was renewed the following year by his

14

executor and became effective in 1970.

15

In 1982, the owners of the film copyright

16

renewed their copyright under section — the same Section

17

24.

18
19
20

And now Jimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock's
estate own 90 percent of the film copyright.
In 1983, relying on a decision of the Second

21

Circuit, the film was re-released as a part of a five-film

22

retrospective of Alfred Hitchcock films, many of which

23

included the talents of Jimmy Stewart.

24
25

Mr. Abend, the respondent here, in the meantime,
had acquired rights from the executor of the short story

1

author and he brought this claim, contending that the

2

death of the author before renewal, as well as the renewal

3

by the executor, operated as a matter of copyright law and

4

policy to terminate any rights that the films owners had

5

to continue using their film.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. PETRICH:

Mr. Abend is an agent?
Well, he's listed as a literary

8

researcher.

9

for himself and for clients.

10

He has testified that he buys these rights

The district court, in this case, granted

11

summary judgment for the defendants, relying upon the 1977

12

decision of Judge Friendly in the Rohauer case, which

13

Judge Friendly described as a case of first impression on

14

this issue.

15

A Ninth Circuit panel, by a split decision,

16

reversed the district court's summary judgment in this

17

case, and so we are here.

18

Both circuits, however, it's important to note,

19

acknowledge that a reconciliation of these competing

20

copyrights was required.

21

I will plan to explain why the Second Circuit's

22

accommodation of these competing interests best resolves

23

the competing copyright interests and policies, and why

24

the Ninth Circuit's accommodation in this case was flawed

25

and will result in a defeating of the policies and

2

purposes of the Copyright Act.
Under the Second Circuit's approach as to the

3

prior work — when the prior author dies and his statutory

4

successor renews the copyright, the court would effect the

5

second-chance policy of Section 24 in favor of authors by

6

providing that all of the rights given to the derivative

7

work owner lapse or revert and go back to the statutory

8

successor of the prior work, with one important exception.

9

The owner of the derivative work would continue

10

to have the right to exploit that derivative work which

11

was made under license during the first term and

12

authorized by Section 7 and would only be able to continue

13

to exploit that work according to the limits placed on him

14

or her by that original assignment.

15

This effecting of the policy actually gives the

16

statutory successor even more than what the author would

17

have had had he survived and renewed because, under the

18

decision of this Court in Fred Fisher, if the author had

19

lived three more months and had renewed the copyright in

20

this case, as the assignment that he previously had given,

21

would have given the movie owners the rights to continue

22

to distribute the movie but, more importantly, to make

23

additional motion pictures.

QUESTION:

even though he had assigned, if he had lived, could you

have forced him to renew?

2

MR. PETRICH:

3

QUESTION:

4

We could not force him to renew.

And you couldn't force his statutory

successor to renew — I mean, his executor?
MR. PETRICH:

5

No.

But there was a policy under

6

the copyright that the Copyright Office had:

7

could go in and renew in the name of the statutory

8

successor.

10

But you had to be careful to be sure that you
renewed in the name of the author if he was alive.

11

QUESTION:

Well, you couldn't do it, could you?

12

MR. PETRICH:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PETRICH:

I think we could.

An assignee could have gone in and —
Yes, we could.

We would have had

15

a power of attorney to do so.

16

so far as to say that the power of attorney was even

17

implied by the prior assignment.

20

In fact, some courts went

statutory successor or the author if —
QUESTION:

So even if — so he could not have

even -- if he'd of lived he couldn't have prevented you

22

from renewing it in his name?

MR. PETRICH:

MR. PETRICH:

No.

No, Your Honor, and —

What do you mean no?
Oh, I'm sorry.

He couldn't?

He could not have

1

prevented us from renewing.

And of course, why would he

2

because he would lose all of the other rights he would

3

have under the contract.
Well, he's just contrary.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. PETRICH:

6

Now, as to derivative work, the Second Circuit

Well, that could happen.

7

came to a conclusion that the court would effect the

8

Section 7 and 24 rights granted to the derivative works

9

authors by allowing them simply to continue to use that

10

work which they had created under license during the first

11

term.

12

But it's important to note that there were

13

limitations.

14

derivative work had been made under license and had been

15

made during the first term of the prior work's author.

16

This was only applicable in a case where the

Secondly, they would lose the right to exercise

17

any other rights under the assignment, such as rights of

18

exclusivity to prevent others from making motion pictures,

19

and they would also lose the right to make additional

20

motion pictures of their own into the second term.

21

And finally, they would remain subject to all of

22

the specific limitations that were placed upon them in the

23

original assignment.

owner of the Woolrich copyright could make another movie

based on it, could it not?
MR. PETRICH:

2

3

I'm sorry, Your Honor, could I

have that again?
QUESTION:

4

Yes.

Under the Second Circuit's view

5

— supposing Mr. Abend, who I understand owns the Woolrich

6

short story —

7

MR. PETRICH:

8

QUESTION:

Right.

— could he not now make another

9

movie based on that short story?

10

MR. PETRICH:

Absolutely.

He's the only one in

11

the world who could make new movies based on that short

12

story now.

13
14
15

He has all of those rights.
QUESTION:

But he could use any of the new

matter that was incorporated in the Hitchcock movie?
MR. PETRICH:

No, Your Honor.

16

still subject to copyright —

17

QUESTION:

18

No.

MR. PETRICH:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. PETRICH:

Well, that —

Now, he's the entire owner.
The problem is that only a part of

the short story was used in the film.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PETRICH:

25

He'd have to make an entirely

new motion picture of that.

19

22

Because that is

Right.
He could make a literal version of

the short story and have no problem from us.

QUESTION:

We've added the Grace

And he couldn't infringe those

additions to the story?
MR. PETRICH:

He could not use the new matter

that was added by us.
That's under Rohauer, which is the Second

Circuit decision.

the assignment, any screen credits that might be due under

the assignment would all still have to be made to the

statutory successor.

Any payments that might be due under

And as I have said, any limitations, such as

16

limitations on the territories or the time in which the

17

film can be shown — they would still be binding.

18

fact this would be the same — the derivative work owner

19

in that case would be in the same place as a derivative

20

work owner would be today under the 1976 act, if someone

21

had exercised the statutory termination right and the

22

statutory exception would come into play.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Petrich, I gather that the

Rohauer decision has certainly not been unanimously

25

acclaimed in the scholarly community, one might say.

MR. PETRICH:

1

Well, Professor Nimmer hasn't

2

liked it, but he also was counsel for the Writers Guild at

3

one time.
QUESTION:

4
5

And the Registrar of Copyrights, I

guess, has filed something indicating -MR. PETRICH:

6

Correct.

That the Writers Guild

7

had — I'm sorry.

8

the Registrar has also said that this is a matter which is

9

confusing and needs some clarification, which is our

10
11

The Copyright Registrar has, although

position.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps that's up to Congress.

12

But Congress created this unusual scheme, and apparently

13

with the idea of letting the original artists or author

14

benefit from whatever enhancement has developed by virtue

15

of use of the derivative works in the interim.

16

MR. PETRICH:

That's not altogether clear, Your

17

Honor, because there's nothing in the record to show that

18

— or the legislative history, that show that the 1909 act

19

intended to discriminate in favor of one set of authors

20

against another set of authors.

21

In fact, the record only shows that there was a

22

debate about whether derivative works ought to be -- ought

23

to have a shorter term and expire at the time of the

24

underlying author's term.

25

instead, all the copyrights, derivative or otherwise, were

And that was given up, and

They both are given two terms of 28 years.

interfere with your plan, if he had lived?

MR. PETRICH:

we would have had the assignment he had given us, which

8

would give us the assigned right to make -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

the assignment does not expire.

decision?

17

That was from the

assignment itself.

13

16

No.

MR. PETRICH:

But that's just a —

Is that just a judicial

That — that's based on the

decision of this Court in 1943, the Fred Fisher case.

18

QUESTION:

And that assignment is an assignment?

19

MR. PETRICH:

So that Congress intended for

20

authors to have the right to assign their interests,

21

including their renewal interest.

23

QUESTION:

1

assignment; it's just an expectancy?
MR. PETRICH:

2

In Miller Music, where you had a

3

competition between an author on one side and a mere

4

publisher on the other, it said that the clear intent of

5

Congress was that the author's successors — in this case

6

the author is dead — the author's successors ought to get

7

the new renewal and they ought to get the renewal term of

8

the --

that case, what did he assign?
MR. PETRICH:

What if he assigned to what — in

Apparently, the entire term, all

the copyrights --

MR. PETRICH:

QUESTION:

16

MR. PETRICH:

17

QUESTION:

Including the renewal?
Including the renewal.

To the publisher?
That's correct.

But who — all he had was the

18

assignment.

He didn't have a -- he didn't have another

19

copyright (inaudible).

20

MR. PETRICH:

That's right.

The difference we

21

say is that, in this case, we don't have author versus

22

user.

23

We have author versus author.
Congress intended for all of the authors to be

24

able to exercise their rights under Section 24 and gave

25

all authors, equally, two terms.

And gave all authors

that same second chance.
And they had to know that if they were going to

3

have overlapping copyrights because there were going to be

4

works that were derivative of other existing work, that

5

there were going to be overlaps.

6

And they made no provision at all — no specific

7

provision at all to say that they wanted some sort of a

8

reversion that would prevent the copyright holder in the

9

derivative-work situation to have a shorter term of

10

enjoyment of his copyright.

11

In this case, if Mr. Abend was right, that the

12

copyright and the film would have run from 1954 to 1970,

13

and that he couldn't — then the movie — Hitchcock and

14

Stewart couldn't use it.

15

another 28 years, and perhaps —

QUESTION:

And they couldn't use it for

Unless they reached an agreement with

the respondents to allow for the use at some compensation.
MR. PETRICH:

Well, the Ninth Circuit expressed

19

the view that, while they understood that there were

20

important policy reasons for reconciling these conflicting

21

interests, they chose not to bring those policy interests

22

into play until the remedies portion of the analysis.

23
24
25

And we think that's where they made the — the
very grave mistake.
They started their reconciliation at the —

1

after they decided that they would favor one set of

2

authors over another set of authors and hold that the work

3

was an infringement.

4

28 years they would treat the use of the film copyright as

5

an infringement.

6

From in 1970 — for at least another

And they said:

That won't hurt anybody because

7

people will just make new arrangements.

8

reasons why they won't.

9

But there are

First of all, in a — in the usual copyright

10

infringement case, an injunction is the usual remedy.

11

that gives tremendous leverage to the owner of the

12

original copyright or the underlying copyright.

13

So

And there's a great danger we think here that

14

undermines copyright policy because if someone in the

15

position of a short-story owner has too much leverage, he

16

is using the monopoly power Congress gave him in the --

17

for his short story — not to just reap the benefits of

18

his short story.

19

He's not coming to us and telling us he wants to

20

make a new movie.

21

what you make on your movie and on the new matter that you

22

have put into your movie.

23

That's the game.

24
25

He's coming to us and saying:

I want

That's what he wants to do.

example, speculators that get into this field will refuse

to give consent.

2

First of all, they have a comparatively low investment.

3

They have reasons not to give consent.

The plaintiff, in this case, bought his rights

4

for $650.00.

5

has spent $2 million to make and to release a motion

picture, he has considerable leverage in deciding how long

7

he's willing to negotiate.

9

Well, when he negotiates with somebody who

Secondly, the person who takes over the rights
of the underlying copyright has other rights to exploit in

10

the meantime.

He doesn't have to sit around and negotiate

11

with the movie owner or the other derivative work owner.

12

He can — he gets to go back and exploit all the rights

13

that the author originally had, in the meantime.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PETRICH:

16

This is the same solution that Congress came up

QUESTION:

Well, then, if that's the case, does

10

it make any difference whether you've got a copyright on

11

the derivative work?

12
13

MR. PETRICH:

Yes.

We couldn't get a copyright

without the original owner's consent.

matter.
QUESTION:

2

But I'm suggesting that normally you

3

can either use it or not use it at your will, as long as

4

nobody can interfere with your right.

5

exclude others doesn't necessarily carry with it a right

6

to use it yourself is what I'm saying.

7

MR. PETRICH:

But your right to

Oh, I understand that.

And what

8

I'm saying is that you — what gives us the problem here

9

is -- that Congress apparently was thinking of giving some

10

— giving all copyright owners a so-called second chance.

11

But they weren't thinking necessarily of this situation.
There's nothing in the legislative history to

12

13
14

show that.
And so, if you just think about one copyright

15

and you say, all right, after the person dies it reverts

16

and goes back.

17

But you have harm here because there have been other

18

copyrights that have come into existence in the meantime,

19

and Congress specifically intended that they would have

20

the 58 years of enjoyment.

21

What's the harm?

QUESTION:

Well, that's all right.

But you still have — I think Justice

Stevens was saying you still have the value of that new

MR. PETRICH:

Well, yes.

And — you're right,

it doesn't give us the right to exploit our own work.

18

What I was trying to explain is that, because Congress

19

wanted us to have the right, this copyright, this valuable

right, it is implicit in that that the Congress did not

21

want the so-called second-chance policy to operate in a

way that would benefit one author at the expense of the

We believe that since this — the issues arise

Below, at the Ninth Circuit, the petitioners

that a grant of the entire renewal term is completely void

Isn't there some tension, as lawyers

Fred Fisher.

There is, Your Honor.

And as

11

this Court I'm sure is aware, there has been a fair amount

12

of comment that the Fred Fisher case undercut the policy

13

that the Miller Music case actually gave effect to.

And

that policy was that the author or his successors were to
15

have a second chance at controlling the work.
In Fred Fisher what the Court said was that the

16
17

person who obtained the renewal copyright did not have a

18

copyright right to continue using the work, but they had a

contract right.

20

no contract right with the author's statutory successors,

So in effect that — you know, if you

there must be some other policy involved in the act.

7

MR. ANDERSON:

So

Well, there is a second policy

8

that's been recited, and it's interesting the petitioners

9

elevate it to the primary policy.

10

If you read the legislative history, there was a

11

concern that if a work was not being used, and it didn't

12

matter to the author, then it should go into the public

13

domain.

14

no one bothered to sign a piece of paper and give it to

to give impecunious authors a second chance, when Congress

2

hasn't put it there.

3

MR. ANDERSON:

Actually I think, Your Honor,

4

that a careful reading of Fred Fisher, first of all,

5

recites the statements in the House Report 60-2222, that

6

authors were often making unremunerative transfers because

7

of their unability -- or the inability, rather, to

8

evaluate when they first created a work its public appeal.

9

And so they were in the situation where, either

10

because they were just starting out and not established,

11

or they didn't know if the work was going to be a success

12

or not, that they were transferring it for a relatively

13

small amount of money.

14

Fred Fisher.

15

That discussion is repeated in

The Court does go on to say that since the 1909

interests are unenforceable as a matter of public policy

IS

because to do so might prevent an author who finds himself

20

in dire straights from granting rights to the second term.

21

I would note once again, though, that we are

22

under the 1976 act and enacting — reenacting Section 304

abrogating Fred Fisher, by making the determination right

One interesting example that was raised in

MR. ANDERSON:

24

In 1952, when Singing in the Rain was made, that was one

year after G. Ricordi was decided.

Second Circuit decision, said that a derivative copyright

conveys no rights in the underlying work and that once the

3

license was terminated or once there was no license, you

4

couldn't continue to use the Puccini Opera.
It was also after Fitch v. Shubert, another case

5
6

where an operatic could not be used because there was

7

neither a copyright right or a contract right.

8

9

It was after the 1925 statement by Mr. DeWolf in
his treatise that — of our exact problem.

That if the

10

author dies before renewal, Mr. DeWolf stated that then

11

the statutory successors could come in and bring an action

12

for infringement, if they continued to distribute the

13

existing work, the existing movie.

14

And the Motion Picture Association of America,

15

in their brief as amicus curiae in DeSylva, they cite Mr.

16

DeWolf as a preeminent authority of the time.

17

And by the way, that brief was authored by Mr.

Nimmer.

20

That was the view of the law.

In 1955, Mr. Bricker, in-house counsel to

this result, then I think it is something that the Court

risk of some importance.
MR. ANDERSON:

11

I understand the Court's point,

12

and I would again note that Universal, which is the

13

subsidiary of Petitioner MCA, never came up with a single

instance of deadlock.

Clearly, if anyone can do it Universal can do
it.

The amicus, who are all the other major

of this specter of copyright death.

An agreement was reached where that was

14

So the concept that a derivative work might not

be made employing existing materials because of risks that

17

might come up in four or five, eight years, simply is not

18

borne out by the facts or the historical record.

If this Court were to adopt Rohauer, the

equal to a vested right to continue to use, would

nevertheless get a vested right.

they had relied on Rohauer for the 11 years and that that

should be a fact that the Court should consider.

Now, the Court did deny cert, in Rohauer, and we

think that the Court should have a free hand to rule on

the issue on the merits instead of what may have happened

over the last 11 years.

But the points I would — the more obvious

MR. ANDERSON:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

when the premier authority in the field said that it was

2

plainly wrong, I think that someone should think twice

3

about how much reliance they actually did put on Rohauer.
Furthermore, Rohauer involved the showing of a

4
5

preexisting print that was made -- they made one videotape

6

copy and then showed that preexisting print over a public

7

television station.
What the petitioners have done here is made

8

9

several thousand new 35-millimeter print versions of the

10

film, and made several hundred thousand new videotape

11

copies.

12

Each time they made a new copy that was an

13

infringement of a separate and different right than the

14

one that was involved in Rohauer.

15

studios could reasonably rely on Rohauer, which was

16

referred to as unconvincing within two years by the Ninth

17

Circuit — by the way, also in 1977 in the Register's

18

report, it called Rohauer one of the biggest surprises

19

under the 1909 act.

20

So to say that the

When you have the Register saying it's a

21

surprise; when you have Rohauer carefully noting that only

22

one videotape was made and it was a preexisting print, for

23

the studios then to march out boldly making thousands and

24

thousands of new copies, distributing works in videotape

25

form and otherwise going far beyond Rohauer, then I think
43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that their just — their reliance on Rohauer is clearly

not justified.
QUESTION:

4

Does your position differ in any way

from that of the Registrar of Copyrights?
MR. ANDERSON:

5

No, Your Honor.

I think that the

6

Registrar of Copyrights put it very well.

7

I would add, though, is that there's that one language

8

which Petitioners have tried to find shelter in — that

9

it's a confusing area of the law.

10

The only caveat

And if I might just

explain a little.
There is no doubt that some provisions of the

11
12

renewal — excuse me — some of the renewal provisions are

13

confusing.

14

It wasn't until within the last year that a

15

district court squarely dealt with the issue of what

16

happens if an author, at the beginning of the 27th year,

17

renews the copyright and then dies and then someone else

18

comes in — his statutory successor.

19

clear — and that I think was the kind of uncertainty that

20

was left open to construction.

21

So there — it's

And --

But as far as this issue goes, I think the

22

Registrar hit the nail on the head when, in the brief,

23

they say that this case presents a straightforward

24

interpretation of Fred Fisher and Miller Music.

25

The petitioners' counsel has attempted to
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

explain Rohauer, or to justify it by saying that what it

2

does is it gives effect to the consent of the author.

3

the problem — and it limits the new uses, or the

4

continued use to that consent.

And

Well, there are several problems with that.

5

And

6

the first one is that you can read Rohauer and you will

7

never find the Court itself expressing that opinion.

8

is the general interpretation of Rohauer because that is

9

all that the defendant wanted.
However, in Petitioners' — at the district

9

MR. ANDERSON:

Since they have, I sure hope they

10

are, but I -- frankly, I can't answer that question.

11

was not something that was either raised in Petitioners'

12

reply or otherwise.

13

They have — the Registrar has nevertheless

14

appeared and has nevertheless urged affirmance of the

15

Ninth Circuit's decision.

16

It

The point that I was about to make was that in

17

the district court, the petitioners said that there was no

18

limit in Rohauer that prevented the petitioners from

19

making remakes of their — of their film.

20

When we came back and said that that would —

21

has blown Rohauer completely into — into new abuses, they

22

back-pedaled and said:

23

trying to effect was limiting the new uses to the scope of

24

the consent that was given by the author.

25

Well, what Rohauer was really

And there are some substantial problems with
46

that.

2

consented to remakes, why is it that Petitioners can't

3

make remakes, if the point of Rohauer is that it gives

4

effect to his consent?

5

Mr. Woolrich consented to — if Mr. Woolrich

If, as Petitioners now state, that it's limited

6

by the extent to which they exercised their rights —

7

well, they never exercised the right to make videotape

8

copies.

9

exploiting videotape copies.

10

But now they've made millions of dollars

So it's very, very difficult to find out

11

intellectually where Rohauer ends and where you -- what

12

effect you give to the consent of the author, assuming

13

that you want to give any effect to it in light of the

14

Court's holding in Miller Music.

15

The -- excuse me.

The other problem with

16

Rohauer is that it gives no compensation at all to the

17

owners of the statutory — the owners of the renewal

18

copyrights and books.

19

The petitioners have said that my client

20

received the rights to the renewal copyright for $650.00.

21

The actual transaction was that he was going to share with

22

the trust — excuse me — created by Mr. Woolrich's Will,

23

10 percent of all monies generated.

24
25

■This is a transaction that Chase Manhattan Bank
handled as the trustee — that they're very happy with.

1

And there's been no claim of overreaching from them,

2

although Petitioners would like to make that claim here.
The main point that I would like to make,

3
4

though, is that this is not a case between Jimmy Stewart -

5

- although it's a case between Jimmy Stewart and Mr.

6

Abend, it is not an issue solely between them, that this

7

case will have far-reaching effects.
The vast majority of the renewal copyrights are

8
9

owned by the children and the widows of authors who had

10

films made based upon their books.

11

will they participate in the profits that are generated,

12

directly attributable to the use of the stories and novels

13

in the second term of copyright, what the petitioners

14

claim is an entitlement to a second chance to use their

15

film.

16

And the question is,

As I've noted, they're confusing the use of the

17

film with the use of the new matter.

18

asking for is a second chance to impose the bad bargain

19

that the author made on his statutory successors.

20

What they're really

Here is Mr. Abend; in another case it's going to

be the next of kin of the woman who wrote Gone With the

Wind or the Sound of Music or Dr. Zhivago.

that injunctive relief has always been discretionary.

could consider in a proper court — in a proper case,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS P. PETRICH

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. PETRICH:

Thank you, Your Honor.

6

I wanted to comment on the fact — answer the

7

question raised by counsel about where Rohauer ends.

8

ends precisely where the present statute ends.

It

If the statutory successor takes over, the

9
10

derivative work owner may only continue to exploit the

11

existing work to the extent that he was given the right to

12

do so by the original arrangement.

13

It would — following the Second Circuit —

14

QUESTION:

Well, let me be sure I understand

15

that.

That's how you include the videotapes, because you

16

said he has the right to —

17

MR. PETRICH:

18

QUESTION:

That's right.

But what if — what if he hadn't

19

produced anything?

You had the right to produce a lot of

20

things by the original range of things.

21

MR. PETRICH:

22

we would have nothing.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

If we had not produced the film,

Well, then, why can you produce

videotapes?
MR. PETRICH:

Because they're simply a version

of the film; they're just a copy.
QUESTION:

2

3

Yes.

Well, that's the point.

They are a

copy.
MR. PETRICH:

4

But they are just additional

5

copies.

6

allow us to use the film, there's no reason to make us

7

take one print around from each theater.

8

seems to me that it's reasonable that we have a right to

9

make enough copies that they could be marketable in the

10

We have — it

way that the product is usually marketed.
QUESTION:

11
12

I mean, there is no reason -- if you're going to

Well, you don't have to take one book

around from one bookstore to another.
MR. PETRICH:

13

I would hope not.

And certainly,

14

that's not the — what Congress thought was a reasonable

15

result in 1976, although I'm not by any means saying that

16

what the Congress did in 1976 has to govern what is done

17

here.

18

In fact I should point out that counsel is wrong.
In our brief, at page 41, we say that the fair-

19

use issue is determined by the 1976 act because the

20

conduct which gives rise to the fair use all occurred

21

after 1976.

22

But the renewal issue and the effect of the

23

death of the original author and the renewal by the

24

executor all took place before 1976.

25

the 1976 act could determine the effect of that 1970

There's no way that

renewal.
And it's not reasonable to say that Mr. Woolrich
didn't get fairly compensated.

There's no record of that.

All that's in the record is that he sold five short
stories to people who were willing to take a chance that
they might use some of them in a film someday, and that he
got a payment of $9,200, which in 1987 was worth something
between $50,000 and $100,000.
It was entirely up to him whether or not he
wanted to take that as a lump sum.

And for all we know,

he put it in real estate and it came out better for him.
But it — I just — it's not reasonable to look
backwards and try to second-guess what made Mr. Woolrich
happy in 1945.
As far as the special expertise of the Registrar
and Professor Nimmer, I want to point out that in 1960 the
Registrar said that the — that she thought it looked
like, in the case where a work — or the first term of
copyright had expired by agreement, maybe you couldn't use
that work any longer.

And she cited it for that — the

Ricordi case — not this Court's decision in Miller Music,
which had come out earlier in the year, in which she cited
Ellsworth throughout her study.

She relied, not at all,

on the Miller Music case.
And Professor Nimmer, who wrote the treatise on

this, from 1963 to 1977 said not a word about Miller Music

2

as being the guide in this case.

3

Ricordi case, which Judge Friendly pointed out had nothing

4

to do with this case.

He, too, relied on the

5

And in fact the re-reading of the district

6

court's decision in Ricordi will show that Paramount

7

Pictures, in that case, who was — in the case of Mr.

8

Abend, conceded that the owner of the opera had the right

to continueperforming

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Petrich.
