ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. TUNHEIM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. TUNHEIM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case concerns the constitutionality of the

12

Montgomery Amendment which removes from states the power

13

to withhold consent to foreign training of the National

14

Guard because of objections to location, purpose, type and

15

schedule of that training.

16

Section 672(f) and was enacted in November 1986.

It's codified at Title 10,

17

The Montgomery Amendment effectively nullifies

18

clause 16, and before I begin, let me just reference the

19

three most relevant constitutional provisions, because

20

they are referenced a lot in my argument.

21

Article I, Section 8, clause 12 gives Congress

22

the power to raise and support armies, clause 15 gives

23

Congress the power to provide for calling forth the

24

militia to execute the laws of the Union, to suppress

25

insurrections, and to repel invasions, and clause 16 gives

1

Congress the power to provide for organizing, arming and

2

disciplining the militia and for governing such part of

3

them as may be employed in the service of the United

4

States, but reserving to the states respectively the

5

appointment of the officers and the authority of training

6

the militia according to the discipline prescribed by

7

Congress.

8

Now, the Montgomery Amendment effectively

9

nullifies clause 16 by removing states' powers to consent.

10

It permits unlimited Federal authority over training, and

11

leaves no control or authority to the states.

12

The Montgomery Amendment is unconstitutional

13

because it violates the plain language and meaning of

14

clause 16.

15

the relationship among the clauses of Article I, Section

16

8, and it upsets a carefully established framework

17

eliminating a fundamental part of the checks and balances

18

as established by the framers.

19

It overturns long settled understandings of

QUESTION:

And it is your position, I suppose,

20

that the part of Section 16 that it violates is that that

21

says it is reserving to the states the authority of

22

training the militia according to the discipline

23

prescribed by Congress?

24

MR. TUNHEIM:

25

Even more extreme than the Montgomery Amendment

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

is

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Tunheim?

3

MR. TUNHEIM:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

The Montgomery Amendment appears, at

5

least on its face, to apply only to the National Guard of

6

the United States, not the state militia component.
MR. TUNHEIM:

7

The National Guard of the United

8

States is essentially the same thing as the National Guard

9

of the states.

Under the dual enlistment concept, yes —

QUESTION:

10

Well, of course, that's the question,

11

whether, whether they operate as one and the same or

12

differently somehow, at least on its face the amendment

13

appears to apply to the National Guard of the United

14

States.
MR. TUNHEIM:

15

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does

16

apply to the National Guard of the United States, but

17

are —

18

QUESTION:

Now, would you tell me whether the

19

President, in this case, ordered the guard units to

20

Honduras for training, or did the President order the

21

National Reserve component to Honduras?

22

them and send them that way, or was this part of the two-

23

week training program of the state militia?

24
25

MR. TUNHEIM:

Did he federalize

It's part of the two-week training

program, but they were federalized, Justice O'Connor, as

1

the National Guard of the United States in the reserve

2

component part of dual enlistment.

3

But our argument in the case, Justice O'Connor,

4

is that simply by creating the National Guard of the

5

United States you can't simply remove from the National

6

Guard the essential state organization, the constitutional

7

limitations that are in Article I, Section 8.

8

9

QUESTION:

But at least the President attempted

to articulate the position that they were being

10

federalized and sent there in their capacity as the

11

National Guard of the United States?

12

13
14

MR. TUNHEIM:

Yes, that's correct.

What's more

extreme —■ yes?
QUESTION:

I take it — I take it you're saying

15

that it's unconstitutional for Congress to divide by

16

statute, as it has done, the National Guard segment of the

17

militia and the so-called unorganized militia?

18

also unconstitutional in your view, I take it?

19

MR. TUNHEIM:

That is

No, it's not unconstitutional to

20

take the militia and organize it, which is what clause 16

21

gives Congress the power to do.

22

QUESTION:

Well, but Section 311 of Title 10

23

says that the classes of the militia are the organized

24

militia, which consist of the National Guard, and the

25

unorganized militia, which is not the National Guard.

So

you have to say that that also is unconstitutional, I take

it, to prevail?

QUESTION:

12

Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't agree

The unorganized, you do not have in

Minnesota?
MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, the unorganized militia by

14

statute exists everywhere, in states and under federal

15

law, but it really is — is nothing.

16

eligible individuals, and that's all it is.

17

it's not armed, it's not trained, and it's not part of the

18

fighting force at all.

19

QUESTION:

It's just a pool of
It doesn't,

There's nothing in the nature of

20

things that requires it to be that way, I suppose.

21

mean, if the Governor wants to be able to prohibit his

22

military force from training abroad, or wants to be able

23

to direct it in all respects at all times, I suppose that

24

he could expend the money to make the unorganized militia

25

a full-fledged fighting force, buy them tanks and planes,

MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, Justice Scalia, currently

3

under federal law there's no authority for a state to keep

4

an organized militia, other than the National Guard, and

5

the National Guard must be federally recognized, so there

6

really is not an alternative for states.

7

between accepting the federal funding and participating as

8

the National Guard or not having an organized militia.

9

QUESTION:

It's a choice

Don't you think the — it seems to me

10

a less extreme application of the militia clause of the

11

Constitution to say that it reserves to the states the

12

right to draft able-bodied people and call them the state

13

guard, if you will, than the contention that you're

14

construing — the construction you're contending for it?

The National Guard is the

It is —
Well, but I mean supposing the

Governor wants to have a militia there in Minnesota to put

down disturbances 365 days a year.

20

of existing law that would prevent him, or the Minnesota

21

legislature, from passing an act creating a state guard,

22

drafting people into it and making them available?

23

MR. TUNHEIM:

Is there any provision

Federal law currently does not

24

permit states to maintain an organized militia, other than

25

the federally recognized National Guard.

than the National Guard.
QUESTION:

Define the term "organized."

I mean,

3

I think we're playing with words here.

4

the federal statute says is that a state can have two

kinds of militia, one which we'll call the "organized

militia," can be called up and it's the United States

National Guard, and the other, if the state wants to have

another one, the states can do with what they want.

is there any federal definition of "organized"?

13

QUESTION:

The organized militia means

It is defined as the National Guard.
Well, if that's all it means, then

14

you can create one that isn't the National Guard, and that

15

will be the unorganized militia.

16

MR. TUNHEIM:

But there's another provision of

17

federal law that says you cannot keep an organized militia

18

other than the National Guard, Justice Scalia, or

19

something called state defense forces, which are not

20

militia, they're not defined as militia, they can't be

21

called forth into the federal service, they can't be paid,

22

and they simply are not an organized militia under the —

23

25

QUESTION:

But they can't be paid by the federal

government?
MR. TUNHEIM:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

1

Well, but what's wrong with the State

2

of Minnesota paying them if they want to have them serve

3

the purposes of the State of Minnesota?

4

MR. TUNHEIM:

Because the militia under the

5

Constitution can be called forth into the federal service.

6

That's an essential element of the definition of "militia"

7

in the Constitution as understood by the framers.

8

defense forces by federal law cannot be called forth into

9

the federal service.

And the

They can be used only within the

10

borders of the states, and as a practical matter

they -- they simply don't exist.

QUESTION:

What — Mr. Tunheim, what do you make

19

of footnote 5 in the Solicitor General's plea where he

20

says 24 states have statutes providing for a state defense

21

force or a state guard that is separate from the National

22

Guard, listing Minnesota law appears to recognize a state

23

guard in addition to the National Guard, citing the

statute?

directed toward this kind of thing, and you keep turning

2

around to speaking of militia.

3

What do you make of footnote 5?

4

MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, certainly there exists

5

statutory authority in each of these states for creation

6

of something called a defense force, but it's carefully

not described as an organized militia in any sense —

because of that.

not to call them a militia.

Surely by simply not giving them a name

2

Minnesota doesn't deprive them of that character.
MR. TUNHEIM:

3

Justice Scalia, it is federal law

4

that doesn't define these home defense forces as organized

5

militia.

6

Federal law identifies "organized", right.
QUESTION:

But they can be militia but not

7

organized militia.

And certainly, organized really

doesn't mean that they have no organization because, as

you say, even Minnesota in World War II had a home guard

MR. TUNHEIM:

So it was organized in some sense.
It — it was organized by the

state, but it wasn't militia in the sense given to it by

17

the Constitution which allows the militia of the states to

18

be called into the federal service, and this is where the

19

National Guard has come from.

20

organized out of the state militia, and our argument is

that you simply cannot take the Constitutional limitations

to make that choice an effective one and to use all of its

lies in the purpose of the dual enlistment system, Justice

it because of the fear that discipline might someday be

read and interpreted broadly enough to include training.
The framers were very concerned about

maintaining an effective state control over the militia

from doing that if he did not want a federally funded

To the framers the militia were really the

of -- of extreme controversy and — and substantial debate

in the summer of 1787 was how much control to take away of

Many wanted to retain plenary state control over

greatly feared, the effect of a large standing federal

QUESTION:

5

What is involved

What troubles me is that the Congress

6

of the United States has authority to organize and arm the

7

militia, not to create it, and the state has the right to

8

create it, and there's a reserved right of the state to

9

control it.

10

There is reserved power in the Governor to

control the militia, is there not, under the Constitution?
MR. STARR:

11

The only control is that of the

12

appointment of officers, clause 16, and the authority of

13

training the militia according to the discipline

14

prescribed by Congress.

15

That is to say, Congress could, if it saw fit,

16

summon forth all able-bodied persons into service of the

17

country.

18

That is precisely what the President did, and that's what

19

Congress has authorized it to do, in providing for

20

military training for those persons who wear their twin

21

hats, their double hats.

It could authorize the President to do that.

These individuals are being trained in Honduras

is such that the use of the National Guard of the United

Is that correct?
MR. STARR:

Well, I take issue with that in

terms of the definition in the Constitution of the

That is to say, the militia is not defined, and

that the militia consisted of a body of persons.

(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National

14

Guard and the naval militia,

15

MR. STARR:

Our definitional difficulties are

arising by virtue of different uses of the term "militia."

15

The term "militia" as used in the Constitution, as I see

it, has to do with those able-bodied persons who can in

fact be summoned by the state, by the Governor — and the

18

Governor has that power.

This is important.

the state's ability to train them includes the ability to

Right?

conclusion, at that part where he says, Congress was

exercising its army clause powers here, and that power is

sufficient to establish the armed forces of the United —

5

to include in the armed forces of the United States, these

individuals, that is the end of this case.

power is plenary.

There is no question.

Getting back to Justice O'Connor's earlier

Congress'

questions.

There is no question that these individuals

10

were in federal status.

Whatever the limits of power,

11

there is no question that they were in federal status.

Indeed, they need to be in federal status in

13

order to enjoy federal benefits, in order to enjoy federal

protections under status of forces agreements.

QUESTION:

General Starr, I have no doubt that

Congress' power is plenary, but I'm not sure that we're

going to read Congress' power to totally eliminate another

power, namely, the power of the states to maintain

That has the effect — and that's what Chief

3

Justice White recognized in Selected Draft Law cases, he

4

recognized it again in Cox against Wood, that that has the

inevitable effect of shrinking the compass, shrinking the

operation of the militia clauses.
Congress does not do that.

7

It does not do that

because Madison saw it at the founding.

That there were
