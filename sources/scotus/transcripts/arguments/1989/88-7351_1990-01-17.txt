CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY K. FORD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FORD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents three issues regarding the

11

constitutionality of aspects of Arizona's death sentencing

12

statute.

13

I'd like to begin by briefly addressing the last of

14

those that is discussed in our briefs, the

15

constitutionality of the provision of Arizona law that

16

makes murder a capital crime if it is committed in an

17

especially heinous, cruel or depraved fashion.

18

That issue is before the Court, of course, in another

19

case, Lewis v. Jeffers, which will be argued I believe

20

immediately after the recess the Court is about to take.

21

And it is our submission, as it is the submission of

22

the Respondent in Lewis, that the case is directly

23

controlled by this Court's decision in Maynard v.

24

Cartwright, holding almost identical language in the

25

Oklahoma statute to have failed to control sentencing

discretion.
The — Professor Rosen, who wrote the seminal article

3

on this — it was relied on in Maynard and also the Ninth

4

Circuit Court of Appeals en banc and the Adamson case,

5

have also reviewed the Arizona statute, its application,

6

in great detail, and come to the conclusion that there is

7

no way in which it can be distinguished from the Oklahoma

8

statute in Maynard.

9

Since Adamson, of course, the Arizona court has gone

10

even farther.

11

Supreme Court after Adamson, and that court continued to

12

take steps to stretch the breadth of this aggravating

13

circumstance even to greater lengths.

This case was decided by the Arizona

14

In this case, affirming a trial judge's finding of

15

the aggravating circumstance which was unadorned by any

16

explanation of what the trial judge's understanding of

17

what the circumstance meant, which followed arguments by

18

the prosecution with regard to an interpretation of the

19

statute which the Arizona Supreme Court rejected.

20

And in this case, the Arizona court took the final

21

step in a series of decisions by which it ultimately said

22

that the fear of a robbery victim, a person who is not

23

necessarily even going to be the victim of a homicide, the

24

uncertainty of — as to the person's fate is sufficient to

25

constitute suffering which is sufficient to constitute

1

cruelty, which is sufficient to make out the statute and

2

qualify a defendant in that kind of a case for a sentence

3

of death.

4

And in this case, as we pointed out in our --

5

QUESTION:

That — that is different from -- from

6

just in the course of a robbery suddenly shooting someone.

7

I mean, I — I suppose holding someone hostage in — as

8

occurred in this case, debating with your accomplices

9

whether you will kill him or not while he's lying there on

10

the ground — I suppose that is something in addition to

11

merely killing somebody in the course of a robbery, isn't

12

it?

13

MR. FORD:

Well, I can't refrain, Justice Scalia,

14

from pointing out that there isn't, of course, any

15

testimony that such a debate occurred.

16

debate is a product of the rhetoric of the Arizona

17

Attorney General and the Arizona Supreme Court.

18

to the.witness, the discussion was over what the person

19

would be tied up with.

20

That -- that

According

But, again, to take the Court's hypothetical, there

21

are always those facts that can be said to distinguish one

22

homicide from another, to constitute as — cruelty because

23

every homicide, as the Court has pointed out in Maynard,

24

is — could be said by a reasonable person to be cruel.

25

You can always find a fact in any case that says,

well, that's a cruel fact.

2

other cases.
QUESTION:

3

That's different than some

Well, what about this — how about the

4

fact that Justice Scalia points to?

5

hypothetical but, nevertheless, that's what the — that's

6

what the Arizona Supreme Court recited.

7

that fact?
MR. FORD:

8

9

You say it's a

And what about

Well, if the Arizona Supreme Court had

said that discussing whether or not to shoot a person in -

10

- in his presence was an aggravating circumstance — and

11

that was the definition of this aggravating circumstance -

12

- that would be, of course, a different case.

13

said that —

They never

14

QUESTION:

Well —

15

MR. FORD:

— until this case, and I'm not sure they

16

said it in this case.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well, what if they did say it in this

MR. FORD:

Well, if they did say it in this case, the

case?

20

point -- our point again — remains, Justice White, that

21

they never said it in any case before and in many other

22

cases where it occurred before that was --

23

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but they — they carried out

24

an independent review of the death sentence and they said

25

here is what cruelty is.

It's either this or that.

And

whatever it is, it's present on the facts of this case.
That's what they said.
MR. FORD:

Well, of course, and that's what the

Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals said in Maynard as
well.

And what this Court said was that that doesn't

satisfy the requirement of Furman and Godfrey, that in —
Furman and Godfrey require that a definition of some sort
be fashioned that then constrains the discretion of
sentencers after that fact.
Arizona.

And that's never happened in

The —

QUESTION:

Well, Arizona — the Arizona court

purported to exercise its authority — an authority under
state law to affirm the — the death sentence despite any
— any evidence that the sentencer below had that in mind.
MR. FORD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

They said, here is a — here is — here is

what cruelty is, and on the facts of this case there was
cruelty.
MR. FORD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

But you say that is contrary to Maynard?

MR. FORD:

It seems to me that that's exactly what

the court of criminal appeals did in Maynard and in
actually in some ways worse because in a court of criminal
appeals in Maynard we had a jury instruction -- we knew
what that jury was told constituted heinous, atrocious or

cruel.
In this situation, because we don't have — we have

2

3

bench trials in Arizona, and that's an issue I want to

4

come in a second — we don't know what definition was

5

used.

6

definition.

7

The trial judge never said, I'm applying this

And the Arizona Supreme Court has said in the past

8

and very critically in the Rumsey case that came to this

9

Court that it is not the sentencing body, that it is a

10

reviewing body, and the discretion that is to be confined

11

I think is the discretion of the sentencing body that can

12

be controlled by rules set in advance and not just changed

13

on a case-by-case basis as cases are analogized to facts

14

that may have been incidental in a prior crime and then

15

become the sine qua non of this factor.

16

I would like to spend some time talking about the

17

first issue in this case.

18

between the expansion of judicial power at the expense of

19

the traditional role of one of our democratic

20

institutions, the criminal trial jury.

21

It is a classic conflict

The State of Arizona here is claiming that it may

22

transfer the most basic core functions of the trial jury

23

to a judge -- take it away from the jury where it has been

24

for at least 300 years in English and American law, by

25

simply changing its label.

By calling it an aggravating

1

circumstance.
And if that can be done with the facts that are in

2

3

their present statute and any fact — they've given no

4

standard by which this Court would say what facts can be

5

changed by that labeling devise and what cannot.
QUESTION:

6

7

Amendment or the Eighth Amendment or both or —
MR. FORD:

8

9

Is this to you a violation of the Sixth

This is a Sixth Amendment issue, Mr. Chief

Justice, and Fourteenth Amendment as well because the

10

specific intent of the framers of the Sixth Amendment in

11

1791 and the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, as evidenced by

12

the commentators, as is evidenced by the words of Justice

13

Jay three years after the Sixth Amendment was written, as

14

evidenced by the Colonial and English history of what a

15

jury was, everyone agreed ad quaestionem facti non

16

respondent Judices — judges could not answer question of

17

fact.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Well, how do you get around our Hildwin

MR. FORD:

Well, the Hildwin case, Your Honor, I

case?

21

think takes us right to the threshold of what the framers

22

were trying to preserve for the jury.

23

decision, as I understand it, involved a unanimous

24

recommendation by a jury under Florida law that implied

25

that that jury had unanimously found at least one and

probably many aggravating circumstances.

3

QUESTION:

Yeah, but there was the trial judge who

carried out — who had the final say.

4

MR. FORD:

Well, the trial judge has the final say on

5

sentencing.

6

may have the final say on sentencing, as judges have in

7

many jurisdictions for hundreds of years.
But on findings of fact that make a person eligible

8

10

And this Court in Spaziano held that judges

for this sentence, the judges in England and America have
never had that authority.

11

QUESTION:

Yeah, but the judge in Florida does.

12

MR. FORD:

Well, the judge in Florida -- as I

13

understand Florida law, in the —

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, have you -- you must take it as we

understood it in Hildwin.

16

MR. FORD:

Okay.

Well, as I — as the Court wrote

17

about Florida law — and I thought the Court was quite

18

careful in many of the things it said and how it addressed

19

Florida law —

20

QUESTION:

Well, what do you do about Cabana?

21

MR. FORD:

What Cabana involves is — as the Court -

22

- I reread Cabana last night and it explains very

23

carefully that the finding of fact that's involved there

24

is —

25

QUESTION:

I know, but in -- he — that — that

1

that defendant was not eligible for the death penalty

2

unless it was found as a matter of fact that he killed or

3

intended to kill.

4

MR. FORD:

And — and as the —

5

QUESTION:

And we — I thought we indicated that that

6

wasn't necessarily a job for a jury.
MR. FORD:

7

Because that requirement was imposed by

8

the Eighth Amendment and — by the Federal courts as a

9

matter of their proportionality review under the Eighth

10

Amendment.

That traditional judicial function.

And this was a benchmark that courts were to use as -

11
12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well, that may be so, but — so that your

generality, the way you put it, isn't quite true, that —

15

that if a — if a fact is necessary to make somebody

16

eligible for the death penalty, it must be found by the

17

jury.

18

MR. FORD:

If the fact is eligible —

19

QUESTION:

That's what you said.

20

MR. FORD:

That's correct.

But the fact — the

21

eligibility is established by law.

22

says no person shall be deprived of life without due

23

process of law.

24
25

The due process clause

In our Federal system the states, by their statutes,
say what is necessary for a deprivation of life or a

1

deprivation of liberty.

2

Fourteenth Amendment in this context and others, then

3

looks to the process by which those facts are found to see

4

whether the due process clause was complied with.

5

QUESTION:

This Court, and under the

I — I take it that a sentence enhancement

6

statute enhancing the sentence if a bank robber carries a

7

gun, in your view, would have to be submitted to the jury?

8
9

MR. FORD:
Pennsylvania.

Certainly not under McMillan v.
If, as in McMillan, number one, the state

10

said — and I thought this was an interesting part of

11

McMillan I had overlooked when we wrote our reply brief -

12

- the State of Pennsylvania said this is not an element.

13

Arizona has never said that.

14

case at all.

That doesn't appear in this

15

QUESTION:

Well, do you --

16

MR. FORD:

Number two —

17

QUESTION:

Do you say then that this is an element of

18
19

the offense?
MR. FORD:

This is necessarily an element of the

20

offense as that term is understood everywhere in the law.

21

It is a fact about the offense itself.

22

QUESTION:

There must be —

Well, every — everywhere in the law does

23

the jury have to be separately instructed on the

24

difference between — two different charges, felony murder

25

or — or murder by the perpetration of the defendant?

1

MR. FORD:

I -- as I understand it, juries do in

2

Arizona and everywhere have to be instructed on those.

3

They don't necessarily have to specify which they found,

4

but they must be instructed that they have to find all of

5

those elements that make up one of those two theories.

6

And that's very much what I understand the Court in

7

Hildwin to have said.

The jury in Hildwin was able to

8

recommend death unanimously as it did because it found

9

some aggravating circumstances.

10

QUESTION:

But take — take this sentence from,

11

Ford, from Hildwin:

12

sentence of death, however, is made by the court after

13

finding at least one aggravating circumstance.

Mr.

The ultimate decision to impose a

MR. FORD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

There it was made by the court after the

16
17

court found an aggravating circumstance.
MR. FORD:

That's correct.

And the court has to

18

identify those circumstances, as I think Justice Stevens

19

explained in his Barclay opinion and the Spaziano opinion

20

with regard to what Florida law is about.

21

Those findings are designed and were put in the

22

Florida statute for judicial review.

23

they are not exclusive factors.

broad statement here that all facts must be found by a

jury under the Sixth Amendment.

exceptions.

And then you've been

But that casts some doubt on the statement as your - your generality.
MR. FORD:

I think not, Mr. Chief Justice, because

what I'm talking about are the terms, as these terms would

10

have been understood in 1791 and in 1868.

11

about the term —

12

QUESTION:

I'm talking

Well, what -- what — what would have been

13

understood about aggravating circumstances in 1791?

14

Nobody ever heard of them.

15

MR. FORD:

Well, they — though that particular

16

phrase wasn't used — I'm not sure the phrase "elements of

17

the offense" was used at that time.

18

that certain facts were prerequisite to a deprivation of

19

life or liberty and that those facts that the law — the

20

statutes -- made prerequisite to a deprivation of life or

21

liberty were for the jury.

But what was known is

Now, the facts that may have had to do with what
sentence should be imposed, such as —

MR. FORD:

Well, I think not.

I think that I'm

2

arguing that if — Hildwin, certainly, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

could be extended logically to incorporate the Arizona

statute.

5

QUESTION:

Well, how —

6

MR. FORD:

But if it does, then --

7

QUESTION:

How does -- does it differ?

8

MR. FORD:

It differs because the statute is written

9

differently, because the statute talks about these factors

10

as considerations and the determination is whether they

11

are sufficient.

12

of one aggravating circumstance is not a sufficient

13

condition for imposition of the death sentence in Florida.

14
15

That they are not sufficient -- a finding

The — the fact that it's a necessary condition is a

QUESTION:

Well, what --

17

MR. FORD:

— judicial one that --

18

QUESTION:

Why should that make any difference , the

19

fact that one aggravating circumstance isn't enough to

20

impose the death penalty in Florida?

21

MR. FORD:

Yes —

22

QUESTION:

How is that distinguished for Sixth

23

Amendment purposes?

24

MR. FORD:

25

Because an element of the offense is a

call them elements.

come from.

3

That's where the metaphor may have

It is — once it is proven, you are eligible.

It is

4

the factual prerequisite to the determination of

5

punishment that may be made by a judge.

6

eligibility is concretely defined in the law of Arizona,

7

concretely defined in the law of homicide throughout the

8

country and in the very many other states that don't have

9

this kind of a provision in Arizona.

10

But the factual

In Florida, the — the facts are — are quite

11

distinctly described as considerations.

12

is whether there is a sufficient number.

balancing elements and they are not something that is —

14

is set out by the —

15

QUESTION:

And the question
And they are

Well, a judge can make findings that the

16

considerations existed, but a jury has to make findings

17

that aggravating circumstances existed.

18

MR. FORD:

No.

The jury has to make the findings

19

that make the person eligible by law for the imposition of

20

the sentence.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

Once this judge —
Well, but no.

Those — those findings in

Florida made the person eligible for a sentence by law.
MR. FORD:

Well, as I understand, the way that the

24

Florida statute is written, Mr. Chief Justice, is that

25

those factors are there to be identified so that appellate

1

courts can look and avoid arbitrariness by saying, here

2

are the factors that are — were in this case; we're

3

looking at comparative cases; we have reasons stated on

4

the record.

5

Those kinds of reasons for judicial opinions, very

6

much like the reasons of the Defendant's — the Enmund

7

factors that the Court said that could be found by a judge

8

in Cabana are not the kinds of core elements — and I

9

guess my point is that, sure, the line is a thin one here,

10

but if you — there is no line whatsoever between the

11

Arizona statute and Justice Stevens' hypothetical in

12

McMillan where the states say the crime is assault and

13

it's an aggravating factor, that it was a homicide or the

14

person died or it was premeditate or it was intent to rape

15
16

QUESTION:

Well, Arizona still has a series of

Court:
Petitioner raises essentially four contentions

3

challenging their — the constitutionality of the Arizona

4

death penalty statute.

5

I too would like to begin in inverse order as they

6

appear in the brief and begin with the constitutionality

7

of the Arizona Supreme Court's definition of the

8

aggravating circumstance of especially heinous, cruel or

9

depraved.

10

In Maynard v. Cartwright, this Court reviewed

11

Oklahoma's aggravating circumstance of especially heinous,

12

atrocious and cruel and found it to be unconstitutionally

13

vague because the Oklahoma courts had refused to define

14

the term to inform the sentencing jury what facts it was -

15

- must find to impose death.

16

It was this lack of definition that left the

17

sentencing body with the discretion to impose death

18

whenever it desired, in violation of Furman.

19

Arizona has not left its corresponding terms of

20

especially heinous, cruel or depraved aggravating

21

circumstance so ill-defined.

22

has taken the terms and divided into two separate

categories.

MR. McMURDIE:

It is no different than any other

aggravating circumstance.
I would like to now address Petitioner's contentions

21

regarding whether or not the Constitution prohibits the

22

state from imposing an evidentiary burden of proof on a

23

criminal defendant to show mitigation.

24
25

In order to understand this argument, the Court needs
to understand exactly what analytical process the state

1

goes through to prove or to show the death penalty in

2

Arizona.

3

The state proves the aggravation.

At that point in

4

time the defendant may present anything he or she desires

5

in mitigation.

6

those facts that it believes to be proved by a

7

preponderance of the evidence and assign those facts it

8

believes to be true mitigating weight.

9

The trial court is simply to consider

The trial court then weighs and balances the

10

aggravation and the mitigation and determines whether the

11

mitigation is sufficient to warrant leniency.

12

The only burden placed on the defendant is that if he

13

wants the trial court to consider facts and mitigation he

14

must produce sufficient evidence for the court to believe

15

that they are probably true.

16

The Arizona Supreme Court independently reviews the

17

record to determine if all of the mitigating evidence was

18

considered and then independently determines if they are -

19

- if the Arizona Supreme Court is convinced that the death

20

penalty is the appropriate sentence.

QUESTION:

What if the trial judge thinks the

22

evidence is in equipoise as to the existence of a -- of

mitigating evidence?

MR. McMURDIE:

If he believes the defendant has

2

failed to meet its evidentiary burden, then he is

3

precluded from considering that.

QUESTION:

What do you do about Mills?

5

MR. McMURDIE:

Well, Mills is a different situation,

6

Your Honor, because there the sentencer was the jury and

7

one juror was controlling whether or not the mitigation

8

was found.

In this case —

Well, I know, but the — but the — so,

MR. McMURDIE:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the net result of it even if — even

13

if it wasn't unanimous — even if it was 11 to 1 that

14

there was a mitigating circumstance, the — or there was

15

no mitigating circumstance — one juror was still entitled

16

under Mills to consider the mitigating evidence.

17

MR. McMURDIE:

That is correct.

The problem was the

18

— the requirement placed in Maryland that it be

19

unanimous.

QUESTION:

But the trial judge here is — unless —

circumstance is proved by a preponderance to his

to what Justice O'Connor mentioned before.

No, I do not believe that's the case.

MR. McMURDIE:

I'm defending this because the

10

Petitioner makes it and based on the Ninth Circuit's

11

opinion there's a deadlock that cannot be resolved unless

12

this Court resolves the issue.

13

In getting back to a related argument of Justice
#

14

White's question, this Court in Franklin v. Lynaugh said

15

that residual doubt to the ultimate penalty — or, I mean,

16

the ultimate guilt/innocent was not constitutionally

17

required for the trial — for the sentencing jury to

18

consider.

19

If the trial court determines that it does not exist,

20

the residual doubt on whether or not it was true should

21

not be constitutionally mandated for the sentencer to

22

consider.

23

This does not offend the common notions of decency as

24

stated in Patterson v. New York where traditionally

25

affirmative defenses in mitigation was placed upon the

1

defendant to prove the existence of such evidence.

2

Rational moral response requires that the sentencing

3

court, in equating whether or not the death penalty to be

4

imposed, rely on evidence that it has determined probably

5

exists and not mere speculation.

6

and it ensures reliability.

7

It ensures consistency

The final issue that I wold like to address this

8

afternoon is whether or not Arizona has a mandatory or

9

presumptive death penalty.

10

I'm not going to take up this Court's time in going

11

through all of the arguments proffered by the sister

12

states of California and Pennsylvania.

13

Arizona agrees with the position taken by those states in

14

those cases that are presently pending before this Court.

15

The State of

There is a difference, however, — a slight

16

difference — between those cases and this case in that in

17

Pennsylvania and in California the question is what a

18

reasonable juror would — or, jury would determine how it

19

is to apply the instructions given.

20

In this case, the trial court may look at the law and

21

review all of the cases to determine if there is an

22

appropriate sentence based on the mitigation and the

23

aggravation posed.

24
25

Regarding the first issue, that of judicial
sentencing, it's the state's belief that this issue has

QUESTION:

Well, is — in your position — is it your

position that this is not an element of the offense?
MR. McMURDIE:

Absolutely not.

The Arizona Supreme

Court has stated that in State v. Blazack, that it -QUESTION:

Well, is it a matter for state law to

10

define what's an element of defense when a jury — when

11

the issue is whether you're entitled to a Federal jury

trial?

13

MR. McMURDIE:

It is within the purview of the state

14

court to determine the purpose for which it — those

15

aggravating factors exist.

16

has stated that the purpose of those factors is simply to

17

channel or narrow the sentencing discretion, which is what

was affirmed in Hildwin and which was affirmed in

Spaziano.

don't think that the phrase "element of the offense" or

QUESTION:

Rather, if you just left it to the judge

and didn't specify what particular criteria would

determine the severity of the sentence — let's say you

10

leave it to the judge to pick between a fine and

11

imprisonment, which also differs in the terms "life,

12

liberty or property" — it's the difference between

13

property and liberty — you could leave it entirely to the

14

judge.

15

So long as you don't specify how it will make the

difference, it would be perfectly okay to have the judge

17

make factual findings, on the basis of which he makes that

judgment.

MR. FORD:

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

There's

is any answer left except we called it sentencing,

11

therefore, it's okay.

far as it possibly can preserving that core of Sixth
