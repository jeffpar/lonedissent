ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BORK:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner Citibank is here on writ of

11

12

certiorari to the Second Circuit.

13

case will be of tremendous importance to the banking

14

industry and to Federal regulators, but the case is not

15

complex.

16

What happened was this.

The outcome of this

Wells -- the

17

Respondent, Wells Fargo Asia Limited, made two deposits

18

totalling $2 million, Eurodollars, in Citibank's Manila

19

branch.

20

government entered a decree that made it impossible for us

21

to repay in full.

22

Before the time came for repayment the Philippine

Now, at that point Wells Fargo Asia sued

23

Citibank in New York, saying that since the Manila branch

24

could not pay, Citibank in New York had to pay.

25

course, think the risk of what the Philippine government

We, of

1

did was on the depositor in the foreign branch, in the

2

Manila branch.

3

Now, a panel of the Second Circuit stated that

4

normally a deposit is repayable only at the branch where

5

it is made, but in this case, because there were routing

6

instructions, routine routing instructions for putting the

7

money back through New York on the way to repayment, that

8

they had somehow — the banks had somehow agreed to repay

9

in New York —
QUESTIONS

10

Well, they found — the Second

11

Circuit found there was a contract to that effect, a

12

contractual agreement.

13

MR. BORK:

That's right.

They found there was a

14

contract.

15

instruction, it was a little odd because the routing

16

instruction said that Citibank Manila would pay out of its

17

bank account in Citibank — its bank account, not

18

Citibank, — its bank account in Citibank, would repay

19

Wells Fargo Asia's bank account with Wells Fargo.

20

And what that contract was, a routing

But simply because it went through New York the

21

Second Circuit decided that it was payable in New York,

22

and then shifted the person who had to pay from Citibank

23

Manila to Citibank in New York.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, we don't usually review those

very factual determinations, was there or was there not a

1

contract to a particular effect.
MR. BORK:

2

Well, I think in this case what is up

3

for review is a question of Federal law.

4

contention that that question of law, when they construed

5

that as a contract, is preempted by Federal law.

6

will notice, Mr. Chief Justice, that nobody in this case

7

defends the Second Circuit's rationale.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

It is our

And you

Well, do you contend that whatever

the Federal law is, the parties could not agree otherwise
by contract in a situation like this?
MR. BORK:

11

They could agree otherwise than by

12

contract.

As we have said in our brief and as the

13

Solicitor General says, this is clearly not a contract.

14

These are the routing instructions that are used in -QUESTION:

15

Well, then you are just arguing about

16

a very fact specific determination about the Second

17

Circuit, it seems to me, if you agree that whatever view

18

of Federal law one takes, the parties could change the

19

result by agreement.
MR. BORK:

20

Yes, but according to Federal law,

21

Mr. Chief Justice, what I am saying is this cannot be a

22

contract.

23

Reserve Board and the FDIC have been interpreting these

24

things wrong.

25

If it has been, then for 40 years the Federal

could have agreed to this liability by an express

2

contract, you would know -- you could protect yourself in

3

every, every transaction after this by making sure that

4

you didn't have such a contract.

If this were correct, all Eurodollars,

billions of dollars suddenly become payable in New York.

been created, for which no insurance has been paid --

MR. BORK:

They are not allowed by their

employer to make contracts other than the amount, the

5

market, and it can't work with all kinds of terms being

6

done that way.

7
8

QUESTION:

It is an oral

Well, does that say nobody ever gets

out of line?
MR. BORK:

9

Never gets — I assume that if

10

somebody gets out of line and makes a different kind of a

11

contract over the telephone that drastic repercussions

12

follow.

13

But that is not the point here.
The point is that we have Federal law that says

14

that these deposits are payable only overseas at the

15

branch where made, when a sovereign foreign government

16

interferes with the power of the branch to repay.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bork, I think the Solicitor

18

General would offer a narrower approach than the adoption

19

of some Federal common law rule.

20

somewhat in that regard.
MR. BORK:

21

I think you differ

That is certainly true, Justice

22

O'Connor.

attractive — and by the way, I am not arguing primarily

24

for a Federal common law rule.

a straight out preemption, which I think I can prove.

The Solicitor General says he finds our rule

I am arguing primarily for

But

1

the Solicitor General says you don't have to reach that

2

issue because the common law, correctly interpreted, would

3

give us the same result.
And he does stress that there in an enormous

4
5

Federal interest here.

6

brief, page 18 of his brief, and towards the end of the

7

brief, he says if the common law doesn't come out right

8

they will have to come back and begin discussing whether

9

or not there is a Federal law that preempts, or that there

10

If you look at page 12 of his

is a common law.

11

The fact is his position rests upon a notion

12

that the law is the same all over the world and in all

13

states.

14

may be willing to rest on that, but the banks and the

15

banking regulators would find that situation present —

16

nobody would know where the risk —

17

That may be true, but nobody knows it.

MR. BORK:

Yes.

I think that is right, Justice

0'Connor.
But the fact is the Second Circuit's theory is
one I had not planned to discuss, because nobody in this
case, not the respondent, the amici, the respondent's
amici, our amici, the government, nobody supports the
Second Circuit's rationale, and nobody has ever seen that
rationale before in this entire market.
QUESTION:

But I take it Wells Fargo supports

the district court's rationale?

Wells Fargo has something more than

It has a really a very

But even without a — it's not

really the district court's rationale, I don't think, but
even without an agreement, a deposit in Manila is
repayable by Citibank in New York or anywhere else in the
world that Citibank has a branch, whenever any foreign
government interferes with repayment by the Manila branch.
Now that — that theory absolutely destroys the
distinction between domestic deposits and deposits
overseas in foreign branches.

And that is a distinction

upon which the banking industry in this area is built.
is the distinction upon which all Federal regulation in
this area is built.

other way, because if all of those deposits suddenly

holding below?

20

MR. BORK:

No, no, actually General Merrill is

21

going to address that aspect of the case, and I had hoped

22

to discuss the Federal law, but I am willing to discuss it

too if you wish.

by Federal law that is not the way to view standard

routing instructions, because if you do all Eurodollars

are wiped out and they all become domestic dollars.

But anyway, the law in this case was made in

Federal Reserve Board the power to license foreign

they saw fit.

But I want to say just a

There is only one finding of fact in

10

this case about what those routing instructions mean.

11

That was by the district court.

as a fact that was not an agreement making the deposits

18

cannot be taken as agreements.

The district court found

The court of appeals did not

entire field I have mentioned to you, Congress' delegation

21

to the Federal Reserve Board to make all the regulations

as to foreign banks.

in its most — its clearest statement of Federal law was

in its 1 70 bulletin opinion, which is to be found at page

25

87 of the appendix, and I will quote just three sentences

from that.
It said said exemptions, that is, exemptions

3

from — for foreign branches from reserve requirements and

4

exemptions from interest rate limits, are intended

5

principally to enable foreign branches of U.S. banks to

6

compete on a more nearly equal basis with other banks in

7

foreign countries in accordance with the laws and

8

regulations of those countries.

9

Having given the policy of Federal interest, a

10

Federal policy in having competitive foreign branches, in

11

the very next sentence the opinion goes on to say, to lay

12

out the law, a customer who makes a deposit that is

13

payable solely at a foreign branch assumes whatever risk

14

may exist that the foreign country might impose

15

restrictions on withdrawals.

16

To make it still clearer, the very next sentence

17

says when payment of a deposit in a foreign branch is

18

guaranteed by a promise of payment at a banking office in

19

the United States if not paid at the foreign office, the

20

depositor no longer assumes such risk.

21

QUESTION:

What would you call that in the world

22

of administrative law, Mr. Bork, an interpretive

23

regulation or interpretation of a regulation?

24
25

MR. BORK:

It is an interpretation of the 1918

opinion, which is a regulation, and then you will have -14

I think this is a regulation.

I think you will see in

1982 and 1983 in the appendix staff opinions published by

authority of the board which say the same thing.

They —

but the important point is the matter of practical

construction for decades and decades, since 1918 to the

present day, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC since

things, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC for 40

years have been saying that these routing instructions,

And among other

10

which every day send $750 billion through New York, every

11

day, these routing instructions are not agreements to

12

repay in the United States.

13

holding to the contrary by the court of appeals, I think,

14

is clearly a holding of law and not a finding of fact.

15

And the finding — the

Now, if the court of — if this Court —

4

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt for a second?

5

How do we determine whether the — whether a deposit is

6

payable solely at a foreign branch?

7

For example --

MR. BORK:

If it's made at the foreign branch -

QUESTION:

— if it is not insolvent it would

8
9
10

have been payable somewhere else, wouldn't it?
MR. BORK:

11

If it's -- under the 1917 regulation

12

of the Federal Reserve Board, if there is insolvency or a

13

credit failure, it is payable by the home office.

14

QUESTION:

Then how can you say it is payable

15

solely at the branch office?

16

MR. BORK:

In terms of sovereign risk, because

17

of the 1918 regulation which said that the reserves will

18

not be created by sovereign —
QUESTION:

19

Yes, but the — but your sentence you

20

read to us says a customer who makes a deposit that is

21

payable solely at a foreign branch assumes a certain risk.

22

MR. BORK:

He assumes the risk.

The risk he

23

assumes is that the foreign country might interfere with

24

repayment.

MR. BORK:

He does not assume the risk if the

branch manager will run off with the funds.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but if the

4

branch manager does run off with the funds, it is payable

5

someplace else.

6

at a foreign branch?

7

So how can you say it is payable solely

MR. BORK:

Oh, it probably is payable — well,

8

under — that is probably Justice Harlan's distinction he

9

made, it's in our brief, which is that it is not payable

10

at the home office.

11

of contract, recision, something of that sort.

12

not the deposit itself that is repayable.

13

QUESTION:

You sue at the home office for breach
But it is

It seems to me one of the tough

14

issues in the case is whether or not this deposit was

15

payable solely at a foreign branch.

MR. BORK:

That is one of —■

If the Court should rule the other way, however,

on these notions that Respondent offers, which are

is on the home office.

MR. BORK:

QUESTION:

MR. BORK:

But if it were I think that New York

The

Federal Reserve then began to make opinions and
regulations of the kind I just read you, which says the
risk of sovereign interference at the branch lies solely
with the depositor.

In 1980 Congress passed the statute

saying reserves — following the Federal Reserve practice
— reserves are not creatable for deposits of foreign
branches.

And the House report said that it is our

intention not to disturb the administrative
classifications that have been made under existing law,
which I think is a ratification of what the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC had been doing all of this time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. MERRILL
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. MERRILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The lower courts in this case adopted two
general theories in support of the conclusion that a
routine Eurodollar placed with a foreign branch of a
United States bank is a general obligation to the bank as
a whole.

The district court found that there had been no

agreement between the parties as to where the deposit
would be repaid, but concluded that as a matter of law
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

that deposit obligation was an obligation of the bank as a

2

whole.
The court of appeals disagreed with that

3
4

statement of the rule of law, but found that in fact the

5

routing instructions that the parties had agreed to for

6

settlement of the deposit account in New York constituted

7

an agreement to repay in the United States.
Let me briefly address why both of those are

8

9

matter of deep concern to the Federal banking agencies and

10

why we think in particular the court of appeals' judgment

11

cannot stand as a matter of law.

12

It has long been understood by the banking

13

community and by the Federal banking agencies that the

14

relationship between a deposit agreement and instructions

15

for settlement of a deposit through the New York

L6

clearinghouse bears roughly the same relationship as any

L7

type of contractual obligation pays to provisions for the

L8

clearance of a check that might be written in satisfaction

L9

of that contractual obligation.
QUESTION:

20

How do — first of all, how do you

21

know this, Mr. Merrill, and second, how do we know it?

22

Was there expert testimony to this effect in the district

23

instructions.

And as far as I know, it was all to the

2

effect that the routing instructions were not understood

3

to be part of the obligation of the parties.

And so, what you are telling us now

about what everybody knows is based on the testimony of

expert witnesses before the trial court?

MR. MERRILL:

If that isn't a question of

15

The district court specifically found two things.

provisions for clearing -- for repayment of -- it defined

18

repayment as the provisions for routing money between the

19

banks, and it distinguished that from collectability,

20

which it defined as where the parties could look to

satisfy the obligation.

understand to mean repayment.

a long time, and this is how the cow ate the cabbage, so

to speak.

And I am asking you what is the source of our

11

knowledge that that is how the cow ate the cabbage?
MR. MERRILL:

12

Well, two things basically.

One

13

would be, of course, prior case law about the relationship

between banking deposits and routing instructions, which

is entirely -- is completely consistent that the routing

QUESTION:

2

Well, how can you say then the court

of appeals didn't disagree with any of the findings of the

MR. MERRILL:

Because the court of appeals

accepted the findings that —

That there wasn't a contract?
But construed the routing

agreements to be a legal obligation to repay in the United
States.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that — in short there

was an agreement.
MR. MERRILL:

There was an agreement about

14

routing instructions, but the court of appeals changed the

15

interpretation of that as a matter of law to be an

16

agreement to repay in New York.

these banks in New York.

First they look to the agreement of the parties,

the deposit agreement.

And if the deposit agreement

specifically provides for a place of payment, that is

where it is determined to be payable.
Secondly, if there is no agreement, it is

presumed to be payable at the branch where it has been

placed.

8

Now, if the court of appeals is correct that

9

routine routing instructions, which are no different in

10

any material respect from the routing instructions that

11

accompany all of these Eurodollar transactions, constitute

an agreement to make the obligation — the underlying

obligation payable in the United States, then the entire

QUESTION:

Well, if it isn't — if we don't say,

as he suggests, that there, it is governed by some Federal

law, then what law does apply here?
MR. MERRILL:

Well, we have suggested in our

brief that as a matter of New York and Philippine law

there is no basis whatsoever for concluding that these are

general obligations of the bank.

of Philippine law, and our invitation brief we simply

QUESTION:

Our

reluctance is to say lucky thing for the Eurodollar market

Justice Stevens, if —
— and that that was in the nature of

a contractual defense, that under the terms of the

5

regulation if such restrictions are imposed they don't

have to pay.

7

MR. SNIDER:

In the answer that they filed, one

8

of the affirmative defenses they pled, although they did

9

not use the specific word "impossibility," was that

10

payment was excused, or that they were unable to pay as a

11

result of MAAB 47 and the action taken by the Philippine

12

government.

But you do agree, do you not, that

MAAB 47 was a restriction on withdrawals?

No, I disagree, Justice Stevens.

think that is at the very root of the case.

to two pieces of evidence that were found by the court

18

below to answer that very question.

I

Let me point

First of all, in the spring of 1984 Citibank

20

made a limited request to the Philippine Central Bank

21

requesting that it have permission to repay only to the

22

extent of its non-Philippine assets that it held in its

23

Manila branch.

which I would submit was part of their litigation

strategy, they got back an answer which said of course,

you can repay these deposits to the extent of your non-

2

Philippine assets at the Manila branch.

3

But here is the question they didn't ask.

They

4

didn't ask can we have permission under this regulation to

5

repay with our assets that are outside the Philippines.

6

Because had they asked that question, they would have got

7

an answer that they didn't like.

8

didn't just sit back then.

9

in December of 1984, and it's at page 95 of the Joint

10

Appendix, the Philippine Central Bank sent a telex to

11

Wells Fargo's counsel answering the very question, we have

12

no objection, they said, to repayment of these deposits,

13

as long as you do not in any way reduce the Philippine

14

assets of Citibank at its Manila branch.

MR. SNIDER:

Justice Kennedy, let me see if I

3

can distinguish two things.

What the Philippine

4

government was saying is with respect to the loans that

5

you have made to Philippine borrowers, whether they be

6

farmers or merchants, we do not want you to reduce,

7

because we don't want an outflow of foreign currency.

8

don't want you to reduce the overall level of those loans

9

to Philippine borrowers.

You can call them in, you can

collect them, you can pay them back, but you must maintain

11

a level of overall funding in the Philippines.

extent that you pay off Wells Fargo, you are going to have

to in addition to that fund other borrowers that were

If you just look at what the Philippine Central

Bank itself said it did, rather than the way Citibank

19

characterizes it, it's clear in Joint Appendix 95, it is

20

clear with the wording of the stand still agreement, which

is Joint Appendix 118, and moreover it is clear that by

the time that the Philippine Central Bank gave partial

permission to repay, based on the request that was made,

Now, you are entitled to argue for affirmance on an

alternate ground under our rules, but the Court is not

3

ordinarily interested in getting into very fact-specific

4

questions.

6

MR. SNIDER:

Okay.

Let me move then to my

second point, Justice Rehnquist.

7

QUESTION:

Could I ask you a question that

8

relates to what you just referred us to in the court of

9

appeals' opinion?

The court of appeals, as you quoted it,

10

said in the present case the district court found that the

11

parties had agreed that repayment was to occur in New

12

York.

13

MR. SNIDER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia.
Now, can't one agree that repayment

15

is to be made in New York without agreeing that that

16

repayment is to be made out of the funds of the New York

17

bank?

18

MR. SNIDER:

19

QUESTION:

I think —
The only factual finding made by the

20

district court is that repayment was to be made in New

21

York.

22

it, it does not establish the point that repayment is to

23

be made out of New York funds, which is what is asserted

24

to be contrary to the Federal banking regime here.

In other words, you don't look to the agreement of the

And that essentially takes us to my second point.

You look to local

QUESTION:

So you agree that no

factual finding precludes us in this case.

The district

court did not find that there was agreed to be repayment

would be in New York.

10

MR. SNIDER:

It just agreed that repayment

I would agree that no fact finding

11

absolutely prohibits your decision.

12

that, once the court made the fact finding that repayment

13

was to occur in New York and it applied the applicable law

14

of Sokoloff, which had been on the books for 60 years

15

since Judge Cardozo decided that case.

16

that law what you will see is essentially this distinction

in the books.

21

goes further and takes a second step and seizes the

that Mr. Bork raised this morning, and I think Justice

Scalia was driving at in his last question.

One of the

10

questions that has now been raised for the first time by

11

Petitioner at this Court and was not raised in the two

12

lower courts is whether or not Reg. D and the 1970 Board

13

interpretation can be construed to displace local law on

14

this subject, which has been a set of dual regulation for

15

the last 60 or 70 years, and has traditionally been the

16

subject not of Federal law, but with respect to state law.

17

We are not talking about the question of reserves.

has been a subject of Federal law.

depositors.

Of course at the time these regs were

adopted, and these provisions that Mr. Bork was reading to

4

this was before Erie, and we didn't think there was a

difference, did we?

6

MR. SNIDER:

In fact,

Not before Erie, but that was

7

certainly the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act.

I

8

think it's really the 1970 Board interpretation that Mr.

9

Bork read to you in part today that they rely on.

That

10

Board interpretation sets up a way of defining when

11

reserves must be made with respect to foreign deposits.

12

It does not in any way purport to regulate the subject of

13

when a depositor can be repaid from a foreign branch.

14

is not a rule about liability.

15

petitioner here has mixed up cause and effect.

16

It

I think that the

What the regulation says is that you look at the

17

contractual relationship of the parties to assist you in

18

determining whether or not reserves must be assessed.

19

at whether reserves were paid, and then from having looked

Governors.

subject of liability as between a bank and its depositors,

After all, that is

That is a very minimal risk when

you are talking about a banking institution in the inter­

bank market.

12

We did not take the risk.

And I would submit

13

that the expert of Citibank at the trial admitted that in

this situation Wells Fargo did not take the risk that some

other regulation might be adopted that interfered in some

way with Citibank's assets.

QUESTION:

Our

You cited as to the Board opinion

6

that's at 135 and 136 of the Appendix, but I -- if you

would look on page 136, what that opinion says is that,

8

under these provisions, deposits payable only at a

9

particular office outside the United States are not

10

subject to reserve requirements.
Then it goes on, however, this is true even if

12

the depository institution, by which I gather it means the

13

foreign branch, even if the depository institution may be

contractually obligated to obtain funds in order to pay

the deposit from another office of the depository

institution located outside the United States.

find that it has at least two important elements.

The testimony

the Eurodollar market we are dealing with dollars in which

these transactions not only clear in New York, but there

One of the important concepts —

remains liable for the deposits.

2

But I wanted to go back to the context —

3

QUESTION:

I still, I still find it hard to

4

understand why, if the New York domestic branches are

5

fully liable for all Eurodollars, there are no -- under

6

any contingency, that there are no reserves required.

7

MR. SNIDER:

Perhaps that was too broad a

8

statement.

Let me come back.

What we have had since

9

1983, since Citibank defaulted in this case, is a

10

situation in the world market, and much of this is

11

discussed in the amicus brief of the Bank of Montreal, a

12

situation in which banks now will only place money in

13

secure money centers.

14

deposits in Manila, no longer inter bank deposits in

15

Panama.

16

Cayman Islands, in a secure location.

17

that is because no one in 1983 assumed that the depositors

18

were taking this kind of sovereign risk, and that is what

19

the trial was all about, after all.

20

There are no longer inter-bank

They are either in London or in Frankfurt or the
And the reason for

We moved for summary judgment.

The -- Citibank

whenever there is any interference whatsoever with our

24

assets or any repayment.

25

their day in court.

And the trial was had.

The witnesses were called.

They had
And

1

indeed the court found that there was no such custom and

2

practice.
And one of the key points that the district

3
4

court relied upon is at the very time that these deposits

5

were made, in June of 1983, Citibank was offering a 10

6

percent interest rate in Frankfurt, London, Singapore and

7

Manila, and yet everyone knew that in terms of political

8

economic instability, the Philippines were a riskier

9

location.

And yet the interest rates were identical.
QUESTION:

10

Well, based on what you say, then,

11

the Federal Reserve assumes that deposits are safer in

12

France than they are in New York.
MR. SNIDER:

13

No, I don't think that it assumes

14

that they are safer.

15

for the Federal Reserve regulation of reserves is no

16

longer a concept that we have to have a certain amount of

17

money set aside in case there is some kind of a run on the

18

bank.

19

I think that the only purpose now

I think that was one of the original purposes.
As the 1980 amendments to the act provide, the

20

only remaining purpose for the Federal Reserve regulation

21

of reserves is monetary policy, the implementation of

22

monetary policy.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So you -- I think you say that the

Federal Reserve understanding is just wrong.
MR. SNIDER:

No, I don't, Justice White.

Let me

1

try one more time.

The Federal Reserve understanding is

2

that because they did not want — they wanted U.S. banks

3

on the one hand to be able to compete in the Eurodollar

4

market, okay.

5

deposits free from reserves and free from FDIC

6

assessments, so that U.S. banks could be competitive and

7

could offer the same kind of interest rates that banks

8

abroad are offering.

To do that they had to make offshore

Okay?

Having set up that exemption from reserves, they

then were concerned about a situation like Garcia, and

11

this whole interpretation came up because of a Garcia

12

situation.

13

deposit at the offshore branch, it simultaneously exacted

14

a promise out of the bank saying but if anything happens

15

to interfere with repayment, I've got a guarantee that I

16

will be repaid in New York.

17

and the Board interpretation is saying no, you can't do

18

that.

19

That's where the depositor not only made the

QUESTION:

And the Federal government

I — if the — if the Federal Reserve

20

Board had been asked how this case should come out you

21

would say they would have said just like the Second

22

Circuit did?

23

MR. SNIDER:

I believe they would say that,

24

except for their objection here through the Solicitor

25

General to the reliance upon routing instructions.

But I

1

believe that they would agree that, in the absence of a

2

Garcia guarantee, that the normal rule of Sokoloff

3

applies, that when only the assets of the bank are

4

interfered with or regulated by the foreign government and

5

there is no action to take on the deposits.

world, and the subject matter that we are talking about is
one that is not appropriate, in my view, to regulation by
a court through enforcement or interpretation of a
regulation like Reg. D.
This is a matter that should be discussed — if
we are going to change the rules, because all Wells Fargo
contends is that the status quo should be maintained, but
if Citibank wants to change the rules, it is a more
appropriate subject either for private negotiation —

(Inaudible) court.
We went to court, Justice White,

because under the rules at that time the depositor could
be repaid, and in fact the court found that when Citibank
announced this new rule, the depositors around the world
reacted with outrage and despair.

No one else in the

world had this understanding except Citibank.
And the court below said you know, it would have
been a dead cinch, you had this view, you knew that nobody
else was taking the view that they were taking the
sovereign risk.

It would have been so easy for you either

by way of contract, by putting a legend on your
confirmation slips, by sending out a letter or some other
means communicating to all these depositors that you had
this unique view that everyone else was taking the risk.
And in fact I don't even believe Citibank had

of the world, then attempted essentially to shift this
