ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SLOAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns the meaning of the term child

12

support payments in a provision of the statute regarding

13

the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC

14

program.

15

child support is disregarded or not counted in AFDC

16

eligibility and assistance determinations.

17

Under that provision, the first $50 per month of

The issue in this case is whether, as the Secretary

18

of Health and Human Services has determined, the term

19

child support payments refers to payments from absent

20

parents, and does not include Social Security child's

21

insurance benefits, or whether, as Respondents contend and

22

as the court of appeals concluded, the term means not only

23

payments from absent parents, but also Social Security

24

child's insurance benefits.

25

We believe that the Secretary's interpretation

should be upheld for three reasons.

2

support is used repeatedly in the Social Security Act to

3

refer to payments from absent parents.

4

current version of the disregard, as it was amended in

5

1988, explicitly refers to payments by the absent parent.

6

First, the term child

Indeed, the

Second, the legislative history and background of

7

the AFDC program reveal a consistent emphasis on the

8

problem of obtaining payments from absent parents and the

9

only prior instance of a child support disregard as part

10

of that emphasis.

11

in light of that long standing emphasis.

12

13

It is reasonable to view this disregard

Third, to the extent that the statute is ambiguous,
the Secretary's interpretation is entitled to deference.

14

Now, a few words of background.

payments.

17

MR. SLOAN:

QUESTION:

MR. SLOAN:

21

QUESTION:

23

Yes, it does, Justice White.
And these are payments to a child or for

the child's benefit.

20

22

The statute does say any child support

That is true.
So, what do you do?

You say child

support is a term of art, or —
MR. SLOAN:

It -- it is a term of art within the

24

statute.

If you look at Title IV of the Social Security

Act, and the AFDC program is IV-A of the Social Security

Act, there is an entire part of the Social Security Act,

2

Title IV-D, that is addressed to child support.

3

throughout both Title IV-A, which has a close relationship

4

to Title IV-D, and Title IV-D, child support refers to

5

payments from absent parents.

6

And

Now, the linchpin of the relationship between Title

7

IV-A and Title IV-D is the requirement that has been in

8

the AFDC program since 1975, that an AFDC recipient assign

9

rights to child support to the state, and the state then

10

collects them.

11

the four — as it relates to AFDC recipients, hinges on

12

that assignment of rights.

13

view the term child support payments, even though it says

14

any child support payments, in view of its repeated

15

meaning throughout the Act.

16

The entire IV-D system, as it relates to

And so it is reasonable to

That -- it's important to understand why this

17

assignment of rights developed in 1975, and why the Title

18

IV-D program, insofar as it applies to AFDC recipients,

19

was developed.

20

has identified the problem of obtaining payments from

21

absent parents as one of the chief reasons that people are

22

on AFDC, and that problem is one of the chief obstacles to

23

getting people off of AFDC and on the road to self-

24

sufficiency.

25

And that is because repeatedly Congress

And it -- it's a very particular defined problem.

1

And Congress has tried a number of different ways, it has

2

been a frustrating problem to get at that problem.

3

that is why child support is in Title IV to begin with.

4

And so -- and in no other context in Title IV of the

5

Social Security Act is it applied to Social Security

6

benefits.

7

And

Let me give you some examples.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sloan, essentially your response to

8

Justice White's question, the statute does say any child

9

support payments, and your response is yes, it says any

10

child support payments.

11

argument that is going on, isn't it?

12

13
14
15
16

MR. SLOAN:

I mean, that's really the
I mean --

Well, the word any modifies the term

child support, and we believe that the —
QUESTION:

So you either italicize the "any" or you

italicize the "child support payments" —
MR. SLOAN:

Well, I think even if you italicize the

17

"any," you still have the word "child support," and you

18

have to interpret what that means.

19

that the place to look for that is the meaning that it has

20

elsewhere in the statute.

21

And I would suggest

Now, it's not an unusual phenomenon for two words

22

to have a different meaning if you separate them than they

23

have together.

24

Yes, it does.

25

Child support:

does it support children?

But there was a recent decision in the D.C. Circuit

of Judge Ginsberg addressing the Freedom of Information

Act that talked about this problem.

3

Judge Ginsberg discussed the fact that the term parking

4

ticket, for example, has a particular meaning.

5

separate it as a ticket for parking it could mean the

6

ticket that you get to go into a garage that allows you to

7

park your car there.

8

And in that opinion

But if you

And it's a similar situation here, that the term

9

child support has a particular meaning in the statute,

10

that to just ask well, does this support children does

11

damage to that meaning that it has in the other provisions

12

of the Social Security Act.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sloan, what does the Secretary do if

14

the payments come in as spousal maintenance?

MR. SLOAN:

Is there a

circumstances, Justice O'Connor.

19

the amendments that passed this disregard initially in

20

1984, the Secretary determined that they should apply to

21

payments from absent parents, and enumerated the payments

22

that go to the state that are also passed through to the

23

family, also direct support payments which still go to the

24

family and voluntary support payments.

And let me back up and

addition to those categories of payments from absent

2

parents, spousal support payments in limited circumstances

3

get the disregard.

4

when the spousal support payments are from an absent

5

parent and are linked to child support payments.

6

conditions have to be met for those spousal support

7

payments to be collected and to get the disregard.

And those circumstances are basically

Now, in the Secretary's determination that those

15

spousal support payments were entitled to the disregard,

16

he cited Section 12 of the Child Support Enforcement

17

Amendments of 1984.

18

the states should collect spousal support payments in

19

those circumstances.

20

provision is clear that the reason for that is because in

those limited circumstances the spousal support can be

22

seen as having a child support purpose.

speaking, child support payments, I guess.

that they serve a child support purpose.

QUESTION:

Well, I guess that is the argument being

made for the Title II benefit payments.
MR. SLOAN:

That is true, with this important

difference, Justice O'Connor.

as the reason people are on AFDC.

10

history with Title II benefits, and it comes as part of a

11

sustained congressional effort to get that absent parent

12

to fulfil his obligations.

15

QUESTION:

Do any of the Secretary's regulations

expressly exclude the Title II payments?
MR. SLOAN:

No, they don't, Justice O'Connor.

What

16

they do is they expressly include payments from absent

17

parents.

19

exclude -- to give them the disregard.

20

that the Secretary carefully limited the payments that

21

were entitled to the disregard and didn't suggest that any

22

other payments might be entitled to them, they are

23

excluded from the disregard.

Now, Title II benefits would be included as

Security benefits ever been treated as child support, in

the Secretary's administration of the AFDC program, of the

child support program under Title IV-D and of the Title II

5

official who has been charged by Congress with

6

implementing all three of those programs, and this issue

7

of treating Title II benefits as child support had simply

8

not come up, because it was so different from the way that

9

child support is treated in other provisions.
QUESTION:

10
11

MR. SLOAN:

That is the term the statute gives to

them, Justice Kennedy.

14
15

I -- I take it the term that you give to

these payments are child insurance benefits?

The Secretary is the

Well, is that the term that you give as

well?

MR. SLOAN:

Now, a few examples of the use of child support in

MR. SLOAN:

QUESTION:

Yes.
And what does it say?

just a heading, or what?

MR. SLOAN:

Justice White.

QUESTION:

MR. SLOAN:

(Laughter.)

10

Does it, is it

Thanks a lot.

But it's also in the

I think you'll find that it is.

MR. SLOAN:

Okay.

I will accept that.

But I don't think that the critical

11

question in any case is whether they are called child's

12

insurance benefits.

13

not called child support, and they are not called that in

14

Title II, and they are not called that in Title IV.

15

The critical point is that they are

And in Title IV, in the AFDC program since 1975, it

16

has been a requirement for the state's participation in

17

the AFDC program that the state administer a child support

18

program in conformity with the directions of, at that

19

time, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and

20

now the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

21

has never been part of the state's obligation, under that

22

child support program, to include Title II benefits.

23

are not treated as that under the state's program.

And it

for example, where it talks about the purposes of the

1

section for which Federal funds are authorized, it refers

2

to obtaining child support, and it refers to payments from

3

absent parents.

4

And similarly in Section 652, which talks about the

5

requirements of state plans, it talks about child support

6

and it talks about obtaining payments from absent parents.

7
8

9

And in Section 658, which provides Federal
incentive payments to the states based on the

10

effectiveness of their child support program, it has never

11

been the case that a state would receive incentives based

12

on the payment of these Title II benefits.

13

state receives it on payments collected under the plan,

14

under the child support plan.

15

Instead, the

Now, Congress clearly knew the difference between

16

Title II benefits and child support payments when it

17

passed this disregard.

18

the family income requirement was proposed by the Senate,

19

and that requirement required including siblings of an

20

AFDC child in the household for the first time in the AFDC

21

unit, the Senate report explicitly refers to Social

22

Security or child support as the types, as among the types

23

of income that would now be included that had been

24

excluded in the past.

requirement itself, it talks about benefits provided under

1

Title II.

2

In contrast, in the disregard provision the

3

language explicitly refers to child support payments.

4

so Congress clearly was drawing a distinction between the

5

two, at least in its -- at least in its usage.

6

And

I would also suggest that the 1988 amendment is

7

particularly helpful.

The judgment here is prospective,

8

and so the 1988 amendment is directly relevant to the

9

judgment under review.

In the 1988 amendment, first, the

10

text of the provision explicitly refers to payments by the

11

absent parent, and contains no indication that it is

12

intended to refer to child support payments of any other

13

kind.

14

Now, the 1988 amendment is helpful not only in

15

terms of the text of the provision, but it is also helpful

16

in terms of the purpose of the provision, because there

17

has been a discussion as to whether the purpose of the

18

provision, of the disregard provision, should be viewed as

19

having the same incentive purpose of obtaining payments

20

from absent parents and trying to get families off of

21

AFDC, or whether it should be viewed as having a purpose,

22

either solely or principally, of mitigating the hardship

23

of the family income requirement and the inclusion of

24

siblings who had previously been excluded.

25

Now what the amendment does in 1988 is it says that
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a payment will only get a disregard if it is paid when it

2

is due by the absent parent, if it is paid in a timely

3

fashion by the absent parent.

4

that, the credit only to timely payments, doesn't make

5

sense if the purpose of the provision is to mitigate the

6

hardship of the family income requirement, because if the

7

sibling had been excluded before the family income

8

requirement and the payments came late, that sibling would

9

still get the payments.

Now that, the operation of

But if the purpose is to add

10

incentives to try to get the absent parent in the position

11

of making regular, timely payments, then the timeliness

12

requirement makes perfect sense.

13
14

QUESTION:

Timeliness requirement in the '88

amendments?

15

MR. SLOAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SLOAN:

Yes.
That also?
Yes, that is.

And again, it is

18

perfectly consistent with this problem that has been

19

identified since 1950 by Congress, of trying somehow to

20

get absent parents to fulfil their obligations.

21

Now, there has been a suggestion that it is unfair

22

to exclude Title II benefits when these other child

23

support payments are getting the payment — are getting

24

the disregard.

25

QUESTION:

And I think it's important —

2

MR. SLOAN:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. SLOAN:

These child support payments.

Yes.

And when these, now the emphasis

5

is on "these" child support payments, when these child

support payments get the disregard,

the Title II child's insurance benefits are somehow

arbitrarily being excluded.

of families on AFDC don't get a disregard, and they don't

13

have any hope of developing a stream of outside income at

all.

15

It is very

But the great majority

I mean, the question really is do people who are

16

getting the Title II benefits, do they get the disregard

17

that goes to people when their parents make a payment,

18

when their absent parents make a payment, or not.

19

that situation they are much more like the great majority

20

of people who are on AFDC who do not get the disregard.

21

And in

Now, there is another point which Respondents have

22

raised which is that the plain meaning of the term -- of

23

the statute is inconsistent with the view that the

24

payments only refer to payments from absent parents,

25

because the statute refers to any child support payments,

1

including those passed-through by the state under the

2

pass-through provision.

3

the provision only refers to payments from absent parents,

4

then it is only referring to those passed-through by the

5

state under the pass-through provision, and it is not

6

giving any meaning to the "any child support payment" part

7

of the provision.

8

And Respondents contend that if

And that simply isn't so.

As early as 1981 the

9

Secretary of Health and Human Services informed Congress

10

that there was a kind of payment known as direct support

11

payments that were going directly to the family, despite

12

the assignment of child support rights to the state.

13

the Secretary has issued three regulations to deal with

14

the treatment of those direct payments.

15

payments that are not passed-through by the state under

16

the pass-through provision.

17

with the plain meaning to interpret child support payments

18

as referring to payments from absent parents.

19

to any child support payments, including those passed-

20

through by the state.

21

And

And those are

So it is perfectly consistent

It refers

Now, as we discussed, the Secretary within weeks of

22

the DEFRA amendment determined that payments from absent

23

parents of various kinds were entitled to the disregard.

24

And the Secretary at that time noted that payments that

25

were passed-through, direct payments, and voluntary

2

payments were entitled to the disregard.
Now, Respondents have raised a number of objections

3

to that interpretation as being unreasonable, because if

4

the statute is susceptible to more than one reading, then

5

the Secretary's interpretation should prevail.

6

One of the objections that Respondents have raised

7

is to the spousal — the inclusion of spousal support

8

payments, the point that Justice O'Connor raised.

9

discussed that the Secretary applied it to those in the

Now, there was one prior instance of a child

of Congress' overhaul of the AFDC system.

The central feature of Title II is that the parent pays

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SLOAN:

Just a few brief points, Your Honor.

First, in view of the question about whether the

11

term child's insurance benefits is in the statute, at 37a

12

and 38a of the petition you will see that the term is in

13

the statute.

14

Second, Respondents mentioned that there would be

15

an incentive rationale with Title II benefits as well, in

16

terms of trying to get somebody to apply for Title II

17

benefits, and so forth.

18

unlike the problem of payments from absent parents, there

19

is no long-standing emphasis of this problem, this

20

incentive problem in the AFDC program, there is no

21

sustained congressional effort to get at that problem.

22

And third, just to clarify one point in Justice

categories of unearned income that do not get any

QUESTION:

However, there are many

May I ask you this question, Mr. Sloan,

5

about his argument that if you look at the legislative

6

history from '82 through '84, that you find in '82 and '83

7

there was concern about the sibling deeming program's

8

effect on Title II recipients as well as support payments,

9

and therefore if you read the whole legislative history as

10

a package, it is fair to assume this mitigation purpose

11

motivated his clients as well as the support people.

12

What do you say about that argument?

13

MR. SLOAN:

Well, if you look at the legislative

14

history you find Social Security payments and child

15

support payments being identified, including in 1984, by

16

the Senate as categories of income -- principal categories

17

of income, that they do want to include that had been

18

excluded.

19

Now -- and it is true that the Senate had been pushing for

20

it, the House had been resisting it, and it does come in

21

conference without any explanation of the disregard

22

provision.

23

It's -- they are given as examples of those.

Now, Respondents suggest that that means, because

24

it came as part of this compromise in conference, it must

25

have a mitigation purpose.

QUESTION:

Of course, the disregard would add costs

to the program.

16

MR. SLOAN:

That's right.

That is my point, is

17

that the Senate, with the family income requirement, was

18

going to be saving costs, and so then the House had been

19

resisting that, and so it is perfectly plausible to think

20

that the House said okay, if we are going to give you this
