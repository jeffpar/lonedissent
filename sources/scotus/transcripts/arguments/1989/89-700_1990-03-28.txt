ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WOLLENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to start — in light of the

12

discussion in the previous case, before turning to the

13

specifics of the Astroline case, I would like to start

14

with a little more discussion of the nature of the

15

Communications Act.

16

The Communications Act is unique in our

17

governmental system.

18

invented by Herbert Hoover a long time ago, and it

19

attempts to handle a dilemma of major proportions, which

20

is the dilemma of the necessity of a licensing scheme for

21

broadcast frequencies to avoid a total interference and

22

total chaos, a licensing scheme which, since it goes over

23

the whole country, must be federally applied, and the fact

24

that the resulting broadcast activities have enormous

25

First Amendment implications because the broadcasting

It was essentially a structure

industry is very, very significant agency for informing

2

the American people.

compromises, if you like, in treatment over the years that

4

is different from other areas.

5

And this has resulted in

It is different from industries not so

effective.

7

which doesn't have a licensing problem.

8

NBC v. United States, this Court said that the FCC is not

9

a mere traffic cop.

10

It is different from the newspaper industry,
So way back in

It's concerned with the nature of the

traffic, as well as its distribution.

11

This Court in Red Lion — excuse me — this

12

Court in Red Lion upheld a very significant action by the

13

Commission in requiring what was called the Fairness

14

Doctrine, which meant in substance that if one side of a

15

controversial issue was discussed, that it would be

16

necessary to provide discussion of other viewpoints.

17

In other words, a diversity of viewpoints was

18

imposed by the Commission and upheld by this Court in Red

19

Lion.

is not saying what position should be taken.

21

very precise or detailed form of content control, but it's

22

a form of content control.

23

Of course, that can be called content control.

It is not a

It was mentioned earlier today, the Listeners

24

25

accurately described.

The suggestion was that in the

It

1

Listeners Guild case that this Court said that it is

2

wonderful — not wonderful, it is appropriate for the

3

Commission to leave entirely to the marketplace what goes

4

out over the air.

5

A closer examination of the Listeners Guild case

6

will reveal that the subject of it was entertainment

7

programming and that the Court, in upholding the

8

Commission's decision to leave entertainment to the

9

marketplace, was not dealing with the nonentertainment

10
11

aspects of it.
Now, it's perfectly true that the Commission

12

over the years and to some degree the Court over the years

13

have gone up and down on the question of the degree of

14

intrusiveness which is appropriate and permissible on the

15

part of the Commission in order to carry out what one of

16

the arguments this morning referred to as the trustee

17

notion of broadcasting.

18

It was suggested from the bench that what we are

19

all in for is to make the maximum money and therefore the

20

only test that will be applied by a broadcaster,

21

regardless of origins, is to make the most money.

22

I would hope that there are other factors which

23

enter into it, but be that as it may, I suggest that with

24

the licensing necessity, and with the Communications Act

25

and its structure having been upheld over the years, that

1

the determination of that question is a question for

2

Congress.
I think there has been unfortunately, today,

3
4

because Congress isn't here except through an extremely

5

impressive and comprehensive brief by the United States

6

Senate -- not a senator, but by the United States

7

Senate — on the subject.

8

and the representative of the FCC is here, there is a

9

tendency of the Court to treat this as an FCC matter.

Because the Congress isn't here

It really, as the brief for the Senate shows and

10

11

as Mr. Armstrong's argument made clear, it is not an FCC

12

matter.

13

the years that it should pay more attention to the

14

composition of ownership of broadcast stations, and when

15

the FCC adopted the policies that have been discussed this

16

morning and then at a later time a differently composed

17

Commission looked as though it was going to change those

18

policies, Congress stepped in and very explicitly told it

19

not to.

The FCC received large numbers of signals over

Now —

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Wollenberg, do you think Congress

21

acted under its Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5 powers in

22

this case?

23

MR. WOLLENBERG:

Justice O'Connor, I find it

24

impossible to comprehend or accept the notion that

25

Congress' powers are somehow greater under Section 5 when

dealing with Federal areas.
QUESTION:

This Court —

It perhaps acted under its commerce

clause powers?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Under its commerce clause,

5

under its spending powers —

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

And I suppose even Congress is bound

by the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Yes, and when we say equal

protection component, we have to say component, because

10

this Court, quite properly, read the equal protection

11

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Fifth

12

Amendment, just as it has read the Amendments to the Bill

13

of Rights into the Civil War Amendments, and just

14

yesterday there was a jury trial — I'm sorry, an election

15

spending requirement of a state that was subjected to

16

analysis under the First Amendment.

17

So I think it is one Constitution, now, and I

18

think any notion that somehow or other the Congress has

19

greater power in its own areas because of the Fourteenth

20

Amendment, or needs to rely on the Fourteenth Amendment, I

21

think is not well taken.

22

I think that the Congress is functioning here —

23

there has been a good deal of discussion this morning on

24

the question of remedial, and I think some of the

25

terminology gets confusing, or imprecise, as to what kind

2

of remedial we mean.
QUESTION:

No one is contending —
Well, I guess — I guess the FCC, at

3

least, stands before us on the premise that it's

4

furthering a goal of program diversity.

5

MR. WOLLENBERG:

No, I think not, Your Honor.

6

think the FCC stands here defending the requirement that

7

Congress has imposed.

8

Congress just late some night did something in an

9

Appropriations Act saying don't change your policies,

I

And contrary to the suggestion that

10

contrary to that suggestion, in Congressional Reports and

11

testimony and so forth before Congress, the focus has been

12

very definitely on diversity and on remedial in the sense

13

that, not that the FCC has discriminated, not that

14

broadcasters have discriminated, but that as a result of

15

society-wide discrimination, which we all know about and

16

which this Court has mentioned in a variety of contexts,

17

that at the beginning at least there was an

18

extraordinarily small percentage of broadcast ownership by

19

minorities.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I thought I heard a spokesman

21

for the FCC at oral argument in the preceding case tell us

22

that the FCC did not rely on some remedial program for

23

prior discrimination, that we should take this case on the

24

basis that the goal of the FCC set-aside here and in the

25

multiple factor policy in the preceding case was to

achieve better program diversity -through minority

2

ownership.

3
4
5

Now, I thought that was how we took the case.
You say that isn't so?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

I do.

The Senate report on the

6

'82 Act said,

"A third important factor in diversifying

7

the media of mass communications is promoting ownership by

8

racial and ethnic minorities, groups which — that

9

traditionally have been extremely underrepresented in the

10

ownership of telecommunication facilities and media

11

properties.

12

"The policy of encouraging diversity of

13

information sources is best served by not only awarding

14

preferences based on the number of properties already

15

owned, but also by assuring that minority and ethnic

16

groups that have been unable to acquire any significant

17

degree of media ownership are provided an increased

18

opportunity to do so.

19

"It is hoped that this approach to enhancing the

20

diversity through such structural means will, in turn,

21

broaden the nature and type of information and programming

22

disseminated to the public."

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Wouldn't it still be fair to say,

then, that diversity of ownership is not an end in itself?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

I think that's absolutely

1

correct.

I think that that is true in jury cases, too,

2

if, Your Honor please.
In other words, when the Sixth Amendment

3
4

impartial trial is concerned, while the Court may differ

5

as to whether it applies to the panel or the venire, the

6

approach is that to have an impartial jury, some degree of

7

representation is — is significant.

8

judgment which is not empirically demonstrable —

9

demonstrable.

10

And that's a

It is not something that can be proved.

It's thought to be a part of the concept.

11

And I think that the notion of having minorities

12

in employment — it was mentioned earlier today that this

13

Court, without disagreement on this point by any member of

14

the Court in NAACP v. Federal Power Commission, said of

15

equal employment regulations by the Federal Power

16

Commission, this wasn't part of your mandate from

17

Congress.

It could, of course, in the opinion of Justice

QUESTION:

Mr. Wollenberg —

It sounded to me like you said that

21

it is an end in itself.

MR. WOLLENBERG:

QUESTION:

MR. WOLLENBERG:

It sounded to me —
No, I was — working the long

way around, perhaps, Justice Kennedy, to say that the

1

reference to the FCC in its function in NAACP v. FPC was,

2

it is different with the Federal Communications

3

Commission, because employment can be important in its

4

impact on programming.

5

Now, surely no one would argue that — whether

6

half of your janitors or even half of your salesmen

7

represent minorities, is necessarily more significant —

8

is ultimately affecting programming, than who controls the

9

station, who is the owner.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. — Mr. Wollenberg, a moment ago

11

you read some language from a Senate report in connection

12

with — was it a 1982 act of Congress?

13

MR. WOLLENBERG:

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18

Yes.

And what did that act provide, so far

as minority preferences was concerned?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

That had to do with granting

permission to process competing applications by lotteries.
QUESTION:

And is that what was — what was

19

involved in this particular case before us?

20

Commission —

21

MR. WOLLENBERG:

No.

Did the

In this particular case,

22

what is before us is the distressed sale policy of the

23

Commission.

24
25

But the point that I —

QUESTION:

Was the distress sale policy

similarly authorized by Congress?
11

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

MR. WOLLENBERG:

1

The distress sale policy was

2

not specifically mandated by Congress — not authorized,

3

mandated by Congress until three successive budget acts,

4

the '87 act, the '88 act and the '89 act, where it was

5

made very clear that Congress, which I, with deference, I

6

think was fully informed — maybe not everyone who voted

7

for it was fully informed, but the relevant people were

8

fully informed.

9

want those policies changed.
QUESTION:

10
11

Congress made the judgment that we do not

Congress cut off funding for the

Commission's effort to reconsider the policy.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

12

Not just to reconsider it or to

13

change it.

I mean, it is absolutely explicit.

You can

14

decide that Congress didn't make the kind of evidentiary

15

findings which has been indicated from the bench Congress

16

doesn't have to make, or you can say that it was wrong

17

because it's not going to have anything to do with

18

programming.

19

did have to do with programming.

Or you can say that you can't prove that it
£

20

And there obviously is force to all of that,

21

but, as the plurality opinion said in CBS v. DNC, which

22

was another case that strongly indicated the importance of

23

Congress and the Commission in carrying out the First

24

Amendment aspects — interests of the act —

particular case depends on the lottery act?

2

MR. WOLLENBERG:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WOLLENBERG:

No.

From which you read the history?
That's right.

It's a part, as

5

the Senate brief makes so very clear, of the fact that

6

Congress, rightly or wrongly, was very much aware.

7

the remedial question —

8
9
10

QUESTION:

And on

But the only statute that Congress

passed that has to do with this case is an appropriations
act.

11

MR. WOLLENBERG:

12

QUESTION:

That has to do —

And the only law of Congress that

13

binds us here is the law that says the FCC won't use any

14

funds in each of these annual appropriations — and the

15

current one has the same thing, I gather — in order to

16

consider this policy.

17
18

That's the only formal expression of Congress'
view, in law, that we have.

19

MR. WOLLENBERG:

It's the only formal expression

20

that — that relates directly to this case, because it

21

said don't change the distress sale policy.

22

reports leading to that, and the — the Kerner Commission

23

report, the FCC's 1978 policy statement —

QUESTION:

But the

When was the Kerner Commission

report?

think.
QUESTION:

3
4

About 20 years ago.

MR. WOLLENBERG:

6

QUESTION:

Well, the FCC —

Which is why Congress passed the

appropriations ?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

8

9

Since which time

the FCC has been on the other side of this issue, right?

5

7

It was about 20 years ago, I

Well, the FCC — when you say

since that time, the FCC has unquestionably, with

10

different members, been on both sides of the -- of the

11

case.

12

there's a big difference between subordinate agencies and

13

the Congress of the United States that supposedly

14

represents us all, even if it sits at home making its

15

decisions.

16

I think that this Court made very clear that

And the FCC, arguably, may be more like the

17

school board in Wygant, or the city counsel in Richmond,

18

or the Board of Regents of the University of California in

19

Bakke, but we're dealing here with Congress.

20

And to say that the only thing that binds us —

21

binds you — is the appropriations act, it's the only

22

thing that directly relates to this — this case — but in

23

terms of whether it was a considered decision and whether

24

it should have the weight and deference that a considered

25

decision that is reflective of the culmination of policy

discussions over many years, it seems to me would be —
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Wollenberg, could I — let me

3

tell you the thing that — that most troubles me about

4

this case.

5

distinguish it from other situations.

And maybe you can tell me how we can

If we accept in this case the legitimacy of

6

7

making a prediction about a person's action on the basis

8

of his or her blood, what other fields of public policy

9

may we use that kind of a presumption in?
I know of no other area where we've allowed it

10
11

to be done.

12

the basis of predicting behavior, if a person is of a

13

certain blood, he will put on a certain programming.

14

don't know of any other field where we've done that.

15

To say on — not as a remedial matter, but on

I

Now, how can — if we adopt such a principle,

16

and say that is legitimate for Congress or the FCC or

17

anybody to do that, what other fields might — might we do

18

that in?

19

well?

20

Or why might we not do it in other fields, as

MR. WOLLENBERG:

Justice Scalia, I can't think

21

of any.

22

that exists with the Communications Act in licensing, and

23

the necessity to be as unintrusive as possible, suggests

24

that the — and it's been done over the years — that the

25

Commission has a great interest in the kind of people —

I think that the — the strange, unique situation

1

their relationships to the community, and these other

2

factors that have been discussed, who will own the

3

stations.

4

And I think that race in this situation is

5

justified — remedial in the very broad sense that the

6

groups that Congress has identified, and maybe it should

7

have included Portuguese, but the groups that Congress has

8

identified have really and truly not had an equal break in

9

our society, and therefore, they may be somewhat isolated

MR. WOLLENBERG:

And —
— they may be somewhat

13

isolated in their attitudes.

participate in ownership, it may affect what goes out on

minority station did something different.

I'm not worried about proving it, I'm

worried about extending that principle to other fields.

MR. WOLLENBERG:

QUESTION:

And I —

And I'd like you to tell me how it

can be limited to this one field, once we accept that

1

QUESTION:

-- for this purpose, why may not it

2

do it for other purposes?

3

MR. WOLLENBERG:

And I respond, Your Honor, on

4

the basis of the special licensing responsibility that

5

means that the people that are put in charge of the air,

6

like the decision in -- in Red Lion upholding the fairness

7

doctrine, which is the kind of interference that would —

8

we would all rather question with newspapers.

9

When the fairness doctrine — when the other

10

Commission activities were upheld, it was on the notion

11

that they're going to make a try at assuring that

12

broadcasting is representative.

13

refused to uphold the injunction against considering race

14

on the medical school class in Davis, it didn't like the

15

quotas and the fixed numbers, it — it made a kind of a

16

race-conscious statement.

17

When this Court in Bakke

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

In December of 1983 my client, Alan Shurberg,

13

who is the respondent here, applied for a TV station in

14

Hartford, Connecticut.

15

Hartford, and in 1984 the FCC refused even to consider his

application because Mr. Shurberg is white.

Does the FCC policy require more than

examining the surname to see if it's Hispanic?
MR. COLE:

No, Justice O'Connor.

In fact,

that's all that was reviewed in this case.
QUESTION:

So someone could —■ a woman could

marry an Hispanic and pick up an Hispanic surname and

that would be correct.

No.

What would then happen or what

woman makes clear on the face of her application that she

21

is, in fact, Hispanic herself and that her name merely

MR. COLE:

It's always bothered me because I

Well, I would agree with Your Honor.

Now, is that a possibility that that is what

1
2

underlay the policy in this case?
MR. COLE:

3

Well, Justice O'Connor, I have to say

4

I've sat through four separate arguments, four separate

5

presentations this morning to the court, and I think the

6

one lesson that I've learned is that there is no basis for

7

saying exactly what the FCC was doing.
The FCC itself, as I believe you've noted in the

8

9

last presentation, had specifically disclaimed here this

10

morning that its minority ownership policies are remedial

11

in nature, and we would tend to agree with that, although

12

some of the briefs in this case have indicated that they

13

believe there is some remedial component.

14

In any event, even if it were remedial and even

15

if it could be said that there is some effort to correct

16

remediation, it is not at all narrowly tailored to that

17

purpose.

18

going back to what was shown in the application — all

19

that was said is Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American.

In other words, there's no showing — again,

It

V

20

doesn't say Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American who has

21

suffered discrimination, who has been the victim of any

22

kind of disadvantage at all.

25

And the FCC policy

is not at all narrowly tailored to correct remediation or,

2

I'm sorry, to correct conceivable discrimination which has

3

occurred.

4

Before I get into the substance of my argument I

5

think it may be appropriate to — to discuss very briefly

6

the standard of review because there has been a lot of

7

discussion this morning, but not much directed to

8

precisely what issues are before the Court.

9

As I understand the standard of review with

10

respect to race-based governmental classifications, it is

11

incumbent upon the proponent of that classification,

12

whether it's an agency, local government or even the

13

federal government to come forward and explain what in

14

compelling governmental interest the classification is

15

directed to, and then to — to demonstrate that, in fact,

16

the classification is narrowly tailored with a good degree

17

of precision to achieve that compelling governmental

18

interest.

19

the strict scrutiny standard.

20

That — that, at least, is my understanding of

Now, in this case, as I just mentioned to

21

Justice O'Connor, there appears to be some confusion as to

22

exactly what compelling governmental interest is

23

supposedly being advanced.

24

given at least based on the Commission's presentation this

25

morning that it is not remedial — a remedial purpose to

1

— to correct past discrimination although I'm certainly

2

happy to discuss that if anyone has questions.

3

Rather, what appears to be the Commission's

4

position now is that it is — the distress sale policy in

5

particularly in the minority ownership policies as a whole

6

are directed to the advancement of program diversity, and

7

that is the compelling governmental interest.

8

citation is to the First Amendment and the diversity of

9

voices and a multiplicity of voices and so forth.

10

And the

I want to say right off the top that Shurberg is

11

not averse.

We do not dispute the value or the

12

desirability, especially in a democratic society of

13

diversity of voices.

14

the way that our society has chosen to govern itself, and

15

we support that.

A multiplicity of voices is clearly

16

Our problem is that race-based classifications

17

are completely and utterly inappropriate and unnecessary

18

for the advancement of that interest.

19

no rational connection at all between the asserted goal

20

and the policy.1 So from that point of view we would

challenge the notion of — of — of program diversity as

only 3.5 percent of the broadcast stations in the country

I don't want the Court to go away thinking that

The 2 to 3.5 percent figure which is so

12

frequently cited by the various supporters of the policy

13

relates only to those situations in which the minority

person or people exercise what the FCC defines as control

of the license, control being defined as 50 percent or

Commission's minority set-aside policy and distress case

sales made no difference in the outcome of this case?

15

MR. WOLLENBERG:

It made no necessary difference

16

in the outcome as far as Shurberg was concerned, because

17

if there had been no distress sale the Faith Center

18

renewal hearing on qualifications would have gone through.

19

If Faith Center won, it would be renewed.

If

20

Faith Center lost, then at that point Shurberg and

21

everybody else in the world could come and apply.

22

would have made a difference, but it wouldn't necessarily

23

mean that Shurberg would have gotten the station.

24

never offered to buy it.

you're the petitioner in this case and you didn't raise

2

any of this in your petition.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

3

Oh, no.

We didn't have to,

4

because the court below — I'm glad you make that point,

5

because this Court has admonished recently that you like

6

to stick to what the petition is granted on.

7

The court below found that what the Commission

8

had done was entirely appropriate under the Communications

9

Act and its procedures and there was no violation of the

10

act.

It held only that the distress sale policy was

11

unconstitutional, and that's all that we're here on.

12

So we're not asking this Court to reverse the

13

Court below on the question of whether Mr. Shurberg would

14

have been allowed under the Communications Act to do

15

something different.

16

Court determine the distress sale policy is (1) nonrigid,

17

nonquota, on very small — about four times a year, when a

18

station is in trouble, the Commission may or may not

19

permit a distress sale.

What we're here asking is that this

It passes on each case, on its own facts, and if

22

the distress sale applicant is qualified, if the

23

licensee's putative sins aren't deemed to be too heinous

24

and the distress sale applicant is fully qualified, the

25

Commission may approve it.

It may not, it may go ahead
