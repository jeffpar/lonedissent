English.

2

It is our contention that rather than do that, they made an

3

example out of her.

4

They chose — and this is in fact another aspect

5

of the intentional infliction -- they chose basically to

6

engage in a psychological assault against Vera English, a

7

woman that they knew was particularly susceptible to that

8

form of attack.

9

Before

the

Administrative

Judge,

one

of

the

10

primary defenses of the company was that Mrs. English was

11

a highly excitable, nervous woman.

12

they chose to subject to an extended period of humiliation

13

and harassment.

14

result would be essentially driving Mrs.

15

brink of a complete emotional breakdown.

MR. PAYNE:

No.
No?
The punitive damages only come into

13

play under Section 210 if the employer refuses to abide by

14

the Secretary's order, and if the Secretary must then seek

15

enforcement in the district court, and at that level only

In the field preemption area you have to

of her complaint are clearly compensable under Section 210.

In addition, we do not urge the Court to hold that

what is preempted is that which the Federal regulates and

And all of her claims fall squarely into that and

all of those claims have been upheld as stating a claim

12

So, the opportunity for recompense for everything

she's alleged is still there, with one exception, and that

exception the district court specifically found as a matter

Government accepts a claim for that and provides complete

In sum, the rule proposed by General Electric is

not designed to be all or nothing.

Our position is that

6

the Federal Government's expressly preempted occupied field

7

of nuclear safety should be respected by this Court and the

8

role — the vital role that Section 210 plays in that ought

9

to be recognized by the Court and the scope of preemption

10

defined by reference to the specific provisions of Section

11

210 .

12

Outside of that field, it's clear to me that the

state's retain all of the authority they otherwise would

have to regulate nuclear facilities.
