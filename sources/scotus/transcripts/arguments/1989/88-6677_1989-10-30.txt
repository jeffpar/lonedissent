ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLUME:

8

9
10

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The question presented in this case is whether Arizona

11

v. Roberson created a new rule of law for retroactivity

12

purposes.

13

dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, that although

14

the facts of this case were not distinguishable from Roberson,

15

that Roberson was not applicable because it was not the law at

16

the time of Mr. Butler's trial in 1980.

17

appeals' decision, the law of retroactivity has changed

18

somewhat.

19

of criminal procedure do not apply to cases which are final on

20

direct review at the time the new rule is established.

21

The court of appeals held, with five judges

Since the court of

In Teague v. Lane, this Court held that new rules

However, common to all of this Court's retroactivity

22

decisions, is the following principle which is dispositive to

23

this case:

24

more than apply subtle precedent to a different fact

25

situation, no real question arises as to retroactivity.

when a decision of this Court had done nothing

1

Because Arizona v. Roberson was nothing more than a

2

straightforward application of Edwards v. Arizona, to a

3

slightly different set of facts, it applies retroactively.

4

The first place to look, I believe, is the, this

5

Court's decision in Roberson.

In the first paragraph of the

6

majority opinion, the Court stated that the Attorney General

7

of Arizona asked us to craft an exception to the rule of

8

Edwards for cases in which the police wish to interrogate an

9

individual about charges which are unrelated to the crime for

10

which the person initially invoked the right to counsel.

11

Court rejected, by a vote of six to two, the Attorney

12

General's proffer distinction of Edwards, and the opinion

13

clearly reveals that this Court believed that Roberson was

14

directly within the logical compass of Edwards.

15

This

Thus, as was true in Yates v. Aiken, another South

16

Carolina retroactivity case decided by this Court two terms

17

ago, this case does not involve a new rule of law.

18

QUESTION:

But every — every decision of ours is —

19

almost every decision of ours is within the logical compass of

20

another decision.

21

meant, we could have been a lot clearer in Teague, and we

22

could have just said that it doesn't apply retroactively if it

23

overrules an earlier line of cases, rather than just following

24

the logic of that earlier line.

25

it has to be compelled by the earlier cases.

I mean, we could have — if that is all we

We didn't say that.

We said

MR. BLUME:

1

The hard facts of Teague, of course, do

2

involve a situation which would require overruling, and the

3

language — however, of course, I think Teague must go beyond

4

that.

5

However, the language of Teague, I believe, was that if the

6

result is not dictated by prior precedent.

7

is dictated by the rule of Edwards, and in essence what the

8

State of Arizona asked was this Court to craft an exception to

9

the rule, not to extend the rule, but to create an exception,

10
11

I agree with Justice Scalia, with you to that extent.

Roberson certainly

and this Court declined to do so.
I think if this Court determines that any time there is

12

an intellectually tenable distinction of one of your cases,

13

that the resolution and rejection of that distinction creates

14

a new rule, then you will in effect be skewing the

15

constitutional balance, and putting a premium on the most

16

grudging interpretation of everything this Court holds, rather

17

than a more faithful interpretation.

18

QUESTION:

What — let's consider the rationality, the

19

reason we sought to draw the line.

The reason we sought to

20

draw it, I thought, was that we came to the conclusion that

21

the main purpose of habeas is to make sure that the state

22

courts are behaving lawfully and doing their best, you know,

23

to follow federal precedent.

24

unlawfully whenever they would, let's say, reject — well,

25

let's use the term exception, reject a perfectly plausible

Now, you think they are behaving

claim for an exception that they thought we might accept.

2

Would that —

3

MR. BLUME:

I think the purpose underlying the rule is

4

does the state have a legitimate, essentially reliance

5

interest, in expecting that the decision will be different.

6

If the definition of what is a new rule is drawn too narrowly,

7

then essentially the states will have an incentive to offer

8

whatever distinctions they have of any case, rather — that

9

are beyond the hard facts of a particular holding, rather than

10
11

applying the decision more faithfully.
For example, Edwards contemplates that the police will

12

conduct their behavior in conformity with it.

13

then we expect prosecutors will not offer those confessions,

14

and if they do the state judges won't admit them.

15

time a distinction is rejected that creates a new rule, then

16

police, prosecutors and stat;e judges have no incentive to

17

apply this Court's decisions.

18

the confession, the resulting confession and any distinctions

19

they can offer in support of that.

20

If they don't,

But, if any

Rather, prosecutors- will offer

Now, those distinctions may prevail or may not in

21

convincing a federal judge that Edwards is not controlling.

22

But nevertheless, the state would win either way, for the

23

rejection of the distinction would itself create a new rule

24

and would deprive that person and everyone within that

25

temporal cohort of the benefit of the rule.

And that

essentially is the Attorney General's argument here.

2

State of Arizona —that the Arizona Attorney General, by

3

litigating Roberson all the way to this Court, and losing and

4

having its distinction rejected, should deprive everyone

5

between Edwards and Roberson of the benefit of Edwards.

6

that doesn't seem to be a fair interpretation of what can be a

7

new rule.

8

9

That the

And

Every member of this Court agreed in the opinions in
either Teague or in Penry that Yates v. Aiken was a case which

10

did not involve a new rule.

11

terms ago, and the question presented in Yates was whether

12

Francis v. Franklin created a new rule, or rather was merely

13

an application of Sandstrom v. Montana to a different set of

14

facts.

15

Edwards.

17

are not distinguishable, and because Roberson was within the

18

logical compass of Edwards, the real question presented in

19

this case is whether Edwards is applicable.

20

Yates was a case decided two

This case is very similar.

Just as Francis merely

Thus, because Roberson and Edwards are distinct --

Because Mr. Butler's case was on direct review at the

time Edwards was decided, Edwards is clearly applicable,

Roberson is clearly applicable, and the court of appeals

decision was wrong.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ZELENKA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

8

The issue being presented before this Court is whether

9

Arizona v. Roberson, a decision of this Court during the last

10

term, has retroactive application under this Court's analysis

11

in Teague v. Lane to a situation in which a confession was

12

entered in 1980 and an appeal was raised that was resolved in

13

1982.

14

Circuit Court of Appeals, when it concluded that Arizona v.

15

Roberson should not be applied in this case, is well founded

16

in the decisions of this particular Court.

17

It is our position that the decision of the Fourth

In the Fourth Circuit's decision, it stated that we are

18

fully satisfied that Butler may not claim any retroactive

19

benefit from Roberson.

20

that the interrogation was conducted in strict accordance with

21

the established law in 1980, and there was no support in the

22

record that there was any actual violation of his Fifth

23

Amendment rights in 1980.

24

decision that it was undisputed at the time of the trial and

25

MR. ZELENKA:

Yes.

There was a statement given.

he acknowledged some knowledge of the particular murder that

he was charged with.

outset of the interrogation, before the Miranda warnings were

given, Sergeant Frasier particularly advised him that you are

being charged now with the murder of Pamela Lane and that will

be the focus of the particular inquiry in this case.

Mr. Butler then gave an initial statement in which

information was given to him, on two occasions Mr. Butler

10

advised him, when asked about his knowledge of his right to

11

counsel, he asserted clearly, unequivocally, I do not want a

12

lawyer.

13

And then he chose to give his statement, his initial

14

statement.

15

Sergeant Frasier, after the initial statement was given,

16

Miranda warnings were again presented to him, he waived his

17

right to counsel, sustenance during the interrogation, again

at that time, and entered a statement in which he admitted

some significant involvement in this crime.

At the time of the

in the language of the lower courts' conclusion was that he

was not sleepy.

he was freely advised of his right to remain silent and chose

not to do so throughout that period of interrogation.

QUESTION:

MR. ZELENKA:

There was another

There were three —

But I can't draw that for the defendant.
Certainly, it is clear in the record that

there were at least three coffee breaks where donuts were

10

given to the defendant, at which time no interrogation

11

occurred and the defendant was free to take whatever choice he

12

did on his rights to remain silent during that time period.

MR. ZELENKA:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ZELENKA:

No, sir.

Whatever choice you made, like go home?
No, sir, he was in custody, but he was

whether in fact he wanted to leave or to stay — leave and

statement that he would go on at that time.

1

dispute the fact, or do you, that this interrogation procedure

2

violated the rule of Roberson, if Roberson had been in effect.

3

MR. ZELENKA:

We have raised in our second argument

4

that Roberson would not be applicable to this situation

5

because he never evidenced a right to have the assistance of

6

counsel during his interrogation, during any interrogation or

7

particular time period, and that counsel had been made

8

available to him at the time of the bond hearing, and he made

9

a decision as a result of those situations.

10

QUESTION:

Isn't it true that both the dissenting

11

judges on the court of appeals and those in the majority all

12

assumed, for purposes of their decision, that there was a

13

violation of the Roberson rule?

14

MR. ZELENKA:

They assumed, for purposes of their

15

decision, that Roberson would be applicable under the facts of

16

the case, but they did not conclude, we would submit, with

17

finality that in fact he would be entitled to relief under

and that he has requested counsel to assist in that particular

interrogation.

In the prior decisions of this Court, particularly

4

Maine v. Moulton, the Court held, in footnote 16, that

5

incriminating evidence from statements pertaining to other

6

crimes as to which the Sixth Amendment, right to counsel, had

7

not attached, are admissible in the trial on those particular

8

offenses, even though that same information and the results of

9

those types of interrogations or information would not be

admissible in a trial on the original crime.

indictment statements deliberately elicited when the police

2

undertook an investigation for separate crimes.

3

We would submit that those types of understandings,

4

that was presented throughout the United States by the state

5

court jurisdictions, clearly revealed that when a separate

6

investigation is involved, Arizona v. Roberson, as it applied

7

the Edwards situation, created a new rule of criminal

8

procedure that did not exist, we would submit, prior to the

9

time Roberson was decided.

Many state courts, we noted in our

10

brief, have taken the position that, since Edwards and since

11

Maine v. Moulton, have accepted the view that Edwards did not

We take these cases, Mr. Zelenka, not to

11

That is correct, and I don't dispute this

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. BLUME:

Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

4

Attorney General raised several merits, arguments.

5

is important to note that although the Fourth Circuit saw no

6

distinction between this case — in fact saw no distinction

7

between this case and Roberson, the Attorney General did not

8

cross-petition on the merits, and therefore I don't think this

9

Court should entertain the merits of the case now.

10
11

12
13
14

I think it

Finally, the only final point I would like to make is
this case is much more —
QUESTION:

It is true — it is true that if we accepted

that argument, it would support the ‘judgment below, would it?
MR. BLUME:

Yes, but I think that it's discretionary

15

certainly with this Court whether it entertain the merits.

16

think under circumstances where the Attorney General did not

17

cross-petition and the case came up on retroactivity, that the

18

proper thing to do would be to reach the retroactivity issue,

19

and anything else should be left to the lower courts.

20

I

The final point is that this case is much more directly

21

within the line of Edwards than even Roberson itself.

While

22

Roberson involved a different charge and different police

23

officers, this case involved a different charge but the same

24

police officers.

25

Roberson are not present here.

Your position covers both situations,

MR. BLUME:

Yes.

I was just making the point that this

7

is much more directly within the line of Edwards than even

8

Roberson.

QUESTION:

Counsel, what if the Petitioner had been

released on the assault charge, and while it was still

I think it would depend on the facts of the case.

MR. BLUME:

Let's assume

They just have new

Could they interrogate him

On different charges?
Yes.
Edwards does seem to be, and Roberson,

12

concerned with the pressures inherent in custodial, inherent

13

in custodial interrogation, and thus a break could make a

14

difference.

15

So, yes, I think, yes.

QUESTION:

All right.

Now suppose we ruled that a

16

break didn't make a difference.

17

Would it be barred by Teague?

18

MR. BLUME:

Would that be retroactive?

I — that situation could still, I think,

19

be within the logical compass of Edwards under some

20

circumstances.

21

QUESTION:

You would have to say that, it seems to me,

22

consistently with the argument you made.

23

the position of saying that where the police reasonably could

24

rely on the earlier state of the law, nevertheless, Teague

25

does not apply to their conduct, and that seems to me

And that puts you in

completely contrary to what we were trying to accomplish in

principle for the decision of this case.

5

And I just point that out to show you that the

you can say that the states had any right to rely on an

But wasn't it — I — hadn't there been a

to interrogation on different charges?
