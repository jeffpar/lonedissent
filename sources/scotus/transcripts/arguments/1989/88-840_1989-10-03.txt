ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. FASMAN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MR. FASMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The City of Los Angeles forced Golden State out of

11
12

business because we refused to settle a labor dispute with the

13

Teamsters.

14

This Court held that the city's decision to deny us

15

a franchise was precluded by the language and legislative

16

history of the National Labor Relations Act because Congress

17

intended to allow management and labor full freedom to bargain

18

and to use economic weapons during a labor dispute without

19

government sanction.

20

private conduct shall be free from government sanction and

21

then a sanction is imposed upon that conduct by a city, a

22

classic case for the application of Section 1983 is presented.

23

Where Congress decrees that specific

This is especially true here, because the improper

24

destruction of a lawful business is a property injury that has

25

been recognized in our courts for 200 years as. deserving of

immunity from damages.

4

Full recoveries traditionally have been

The rule in our courts under Section 1983 is that

5

cities are fully liable for the consequences of their illegal

6

actions.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Fasman, are you contending that

8

merely because there was a Supremacy Clause violation you're

9

entitled to recover under Section 1983?

10

MR. FASMAN:

No, we are not.

The test under Section

11

1983 is whether we were denied rights, privileges and

12

immunities secured by federal law.

13

Our position is that the traditional Section 1983

14

tests, repeatedly endorsed by this Court, should govern

15

whether — the question of whether we were denied such rights,

16

privileges and immunities.

17
18

QUESTION:

And so what -- what federal law was it

that protected this right that you say was denied to you?

MR. FASMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. FASMAN:

22

No, we don't — we don't contend that all Supremacy

clear in our — in our papers.

Section 1983 require a finding that we did -- we were in fact

2

denied, rights, privileges and immunities under federal law.
This Court repeatedly has made clear that rights

3
4

enforceable under the statute arise when the constitutional or

5

a federal statute imposes mandatory obligations upon local

6

government.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Fasman, would you explain how a

8

mere finding of preemption by the federal labor law satisfies

9

the test?

10

MR. FASMAN:

Well, I think that in this case the

11

mere finding of preemption rested upon the proposition that

12

Congress specifically decreed that private parties shall have

13

the right to engage in certain conduct; that is, collective

14

bargaining and the use of economic weapons during a labor

15

dispute.

1

16

I think that that is different than the normal type

17

of finding of -- of preemption that involves, for example,

18

federal regulatory schemes and more amorphous findings.

19

In this case, we have specific rights that were

20

granted to us by Congress, and those rights were

21

obviously -- were obviously denied when we were put out of

22

business for our — for our exercising them.

23

It seems to me that — that what this Court's

24

initial opinion said was that the -- was that this case

25

involves mandatory obligations that is — that are imposed

We're still on the

That's exact -- that's exactly right.

The case, Justice White, the case came up on summary

judgment that was granted to the city, and that summary

judgment, this Court found, was wrong as a matter of law, and

9

the remedial issue was not — was not reached in the case.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

At any point in the proceedings has the

city contested the award of the ancillary damages?
MR. FASMAN:

Yes.

The city -- the city in the

13

district court opposed the award of ancillary damages and

14

indicated that they were not — that ancillary damages were

15

not properly entered in this case either as a matter of law or

16

as a matter of fact.

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I know it's not an issue

21

the issues we're discussing here today?

MR. FASMAN:

What is the authority for the

Well, the — the authority, Justice

23

Kennedy, is — is basically the equitable authority that

24

inheres in the Court to assure that injunctive relief is

That was the

basis upon which the -- the lower court ruled and I believe

2

the -- the — I can't recall quite precisely right now what

3

the name of those cases are.

QUESTION:
to address -MR. FASMAN:

6
7

Yes, there is Supreme Court authority

to that — to that effect.

8
9

And — and -- and we have some authority

I have to say that the ancillary damages that -that the district court awarded in this case, as we pointed

10

out in the papers, are likely to yield nothing to Golden State

11

because the Court balanced our tangible assets against our

12

intangible liabilities, and it's plainly an — an inadequate

13

remedy.

14

The question before the Court, it seems — it seems

15

to me, and the question raised by the Ninth Circuit below, is

16

whether there is any warrant for departing from the

17

traditional Section 1983 tests in this case.

18

We say no.

The essential question in every Section

19

1983 case, preemption or otherwise, is the same:

20

federally guaranteed rights, privileges or immunities have

21

been denied?

22

Have

If so, and if Congress has not foreclosed access to

23

Section 1983 by devising an alternative statutory remedy,

24

Section 1983 is available.

25

None of the briefs before the Court claim that

1

Section 1983 is inapplicable in every preemption case, and the

2

court below did not so hold.

3

The Supremacy Clause is involved in some way in

4

every Section 1983 case, statutory or constitutional, because

5

it alone obliges local governments to obey federal law.

6

in constitutional cases, the Supremacy Clause is violated

7

because the local government has failed to accord federal law

8

the priority that it deserves.

9

Even

Thus, it cannot be that Section 1983 never applies

10

in any preemption case or any case involving the Supremacy

11

Clause because, by definition, every Section 1983 case in some

12

way involves the Supremacy Clause.

13
14
15

For this reason, all of the briefs before the
Court —

far, doesn't it?

19

acting under state law, and in that case the Supremacy Clause

20

would not be involved.

That's exactly

1

right.

2

3

Undertaken -- under color of state law; that is right.
QUESTION:

Furthermore, the Fourteenth Amendment is

directly applicable to the states.

4

MR. FASMAN:

5

QUESTION:

Well, it is -It says no state shall deprive, and

6

Congress has specific authority under that, under the -- the

7

fifth clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to pass legislation

8

to enforce it.

9
10

So, I should think if the Constitution did not have
a Supremacy Clause it wouldn't make any difference.

11

MR. FASMAN:

I think — I think this may be a very

12

nice juridical — juridical point.

13

that may be right if there were no Supremacy Clause, but there

14

is a Supremacy Clause; and whatever the Fourteenth Amendment

15

says, even if it says no state shall deny, nonetheless, the

16

point that I'm making is that the Supremacy Clause says that

17

the state shall obey that amendment.

I think that may be --

18

So, it is involved in some way in every -- in every

19

case, although that — it is an interesting case, as if there

20

were no Supremacy Clause.

21

My point is, though, that the dispute before the

22

Court is not whether Section 1983 applies in some preemption

23

cases.

24

what test should be used to determine whether Section 1983

25

applies.

Everyone seems to agree that it does.

The dispute is

We see absolutely no reason to depart from the

1
2

traditional standards used by this Court and by most courts

3

below in this — in this or any other Section 1983 case.

4

Under those standards, whether Congress created rights,

5

privileges or immunities depends upon the intent of the

6

legislature.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Fasman, maybe this really isn't a

8

difference, but the rule you rely on that a preemption based

9

on the Machinists analysis and so forth, you could really say

10

that's a judge-made rule of law rather than the clear

11

statutory directive as we have in most 1983 cases.

12

Do you think that makes any difference?

13

MR. FASMAN:

I think the question in all Section

14

1983 cases goes back to the intent of the legislature.

15

think Machinists is based upon a clear read -- reading of the

16

language, legislative history of the National Labor Relations

17

Act and, in fact, has a statutory basis.

18

I

It is true that it was iterated by the Court, but I

19

think the foundation of Machinists is very clear both in

20

term -- both in terms of the language and the legislative

21

history.

22

the test is the same.

23

So I don't think that makes a difference.

I think

The question is what did Congress intend, and that's

24

our basic point here.

Circuit and the court below, and they said, well, we don't

2

have to look at congressional intent.
QUESTION:

3
4

That's not the test.

Are you saying that our — our first

opinion in Golden State three years ago decided this case?
MR. FASMAN:

5

I think, in essence, it did.

It did

6

not in so many — in so many words, because, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, what the Court said was that — and reiterated,

8

actually, that management and labor have these freedoms; that

9

Congress protected this conduct from government sanction.

10

That should, in our view, have resolved this matter.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what -- what is your response to

12

the argument of Respondents that the National Labor Relations

13

Act essentially creates rights in -- in employees and

14

employers enforceable against one another?

15

MR. FASMAN:

Well, the — the simple answer to that

16

is that that is directly contrary to the interpretive approach

17

that this Court has taken in Machinists and H. K. Porter in

18

the whole second branch of the preemption -- in the preemption

19

doctrine.

20

The court below — one of our fundamental points

21

here is that the court below didn't have the authority to

22

reinterpret the NLRA in a narrowly-cabined version as they

23

did.

bargaining to state and local governments on the basis of

Congressional intent, which that should — this Court's

rulings along those lines should have resolved that issue.

MR. FASMAN:

That's right.

That's exactly right.

That you had an enforceable right not

11

only against the — not only against the employees but also

12

against the -- the state.

13

MR. FASMAN:

And that's been accepted law at least

14

since the '76 decision in the Machinists case, where the

Court — where the Court first — first declared the second

branch — second branch of the preemption doctrine.

QUESTION:

5

Of course, if there were an injunction

that — that this preemption, this so-called preemption right

really entitled somebody to an injunction.

MR. FASMAN:

Well, not only — not only did the

The decision below, the Ninth Circuit said in so

The Ninth Circuit concluded that even though

2

Congress intended to ban the city's conduct, Section 1983

relief was not available, and I quote, because, quote,

MR. FASMAN:

I think under the standard accepted

test that the courts applied in Section 1983 cases, we fall

9

clearly within it.

10

QUESTION:

I suppose you could say that Congress may

11

have intended an injunction but didn't intend any right to

12

damages, just because the city was doing what it shouldn't

13

have done.

14

MR. FASMAN:

Well, that -- that may be, but I think

15

the — I think our essential point is that that would be a

16

very unusual result if we have rights, privileges or

17

immunities, and I think under the Court's traditional

18

standards we do, the proposition that we're entitled only to

19

injunctive relief would be extraordinarily unusual because

20

Congress created a broad damage remedy that allows citizens

21

deprived of rights, privileges and — and immunities

22

guaranteed under federal law to sue for damages in the federal

23

courts, and that's precisely our claim in this case.

MR. FASMAN:

MR. FASMAN:

Well —
In addition to an injunction.

My point is and our point here --

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, not necessarily.

You recognize a

right by granting an injunction.
MR. FASMAN:

Well, but the point is that if we have

11

a right, privilege or immunity that's enforceable otherwise

12

under Section 1983, we're entitled to damages for the

13

infringement of that right.

14

My point is not that it's just preemption but that

15

we were granted rights, privileges or immunities; that we were

granted the right to bargain free from government sanction;

17

that we were granted -- labor is granted the right to strike,

weapons against one another.

QUESTION:

Well, if you're right, Mr. Fasman, then

21

although you said earlier in your argument that violation of

the Supremacy Clause is not enough to recover damages under

Section 1983, can you think of any case that would not give

Honorable Chief Justice and may it

As the — in — in response to Justice Scalia's

No, I'm not.

I'm saying he's pled a

separate cause of actions under the declaratory relief act,

22

and under that act, the court granted an injunction.

declaratory relief does not mean that the plaintiff's entitled

law — namely, the National Labor Relations Act — granted the

Plaintiff rights within the meaning of 1983 is whether or not

4

Congress intended that a statute secures rights within the

The issue in a 1983 case focuses on whether or not

11

Congress intended to grant rights to the specific individual

12

who is asserting it.

13

Congress intends to create substantive rights to — of others

14

engage in such action or forbearance of those rights demand,

15

that Congress will use in the particular statute such

16

unambiguous language so as to command such action or

17

forbearance.

And it's certainly to be presumed, if

18

In other words, to put such persons on notice as

19

what is expected from them, because, after all, the reason

20

that Congress creates rights is to have others honor those

21

rights.

22

Now, looking at the statutory language of 8(d) as

23

amended in the — the NLRA and its legislative history, it

24

indicate that that was not Congress' intent.

25

What does 8(d) say as amended?

All 8(d) says is

1

that the obligation to bargain in good faith does not compel a

2

party to reach an agreement.

3

provides that the failure to reach an agreement in a

4

bargaining environment does not subject that person to a

Yes, but I would say that is a right

Just because the word

24

"right" is used, it has to be looked at in the context in

25

which it is used, just like in the Pennhurst case.

1

In Pennhurst, Congress had set out what they called

2

a bill of rights for the — the disabled; but despite of that

3

this Court did not find that the plaintiff in Pennhurst had a

4

right within the meaning of 1983.

5

Now, as far as the legislative history of the

6

National Labor Relations Act, counsel makes reference to the

7

fact that the Act talks in terms of the rights of the employer

8

and employee.

9

talks about the legitimate rights of these parties in their

10

relations with each other, and the purpose is, according to

11

141 of the National Labor Relations Act, is to avoid

12

industrial strike.

13

But what the Act says in 29 U.S.C. 141, it

You look at the declared purpose of the National

14

Labor Relations Act, and all it speaks of is the obligations

15

to the parties in reference to each other.

16

And as far as 8(d) itself is concerned, that

17

amendment -- or, rather, it was amended in 1947 to provide

18

what is a relevant language in this case, namely, the refusal

19

to make a concession does not come within -- is -- is not a

20

requirement in order to bargain in good faith.

21

And as far as that specific language is concerned,

22

the congressional Service, discussing the House bill and the

23

Senate bill as to that language, said that the reason for that

24

language was that the board was requiring employers to make

25

concessions to show that they were bargaining in good faith.

1

That language had a very specific purpose, because the

2

legislature felt that the National Labor Relations Board was,

3

in effect, going too far in putting pressure on an employer in

4

its bargaining with the union.

5

And, in fact, this Court in Porter Company v.

6

National Labor Relations Board, in talking about that specific

7

language, pointed out the reason for it is that unless

8

Congress writes into the law guides for the board to follow,

9

the board may attempt to carry this process still further and

10

seek to control more and more of the terms of collecting

11

bargaining agreements.

12

I submit the reason for that language was not meant

13

to give an employer, as in this case, rights against a third

14

party, but it was meant to, in effect, control what the

15

legislature saw as an abuse of power by the board.

In fact, drawing an analogy from the implied right

1983 actions and in the Cannon case, the — the court has used

4

the first test, whether or not Congress intends to create a

And in the Cannon case, it points out that in

2

problem that local entities, not knowing when they may be

-- before you leave that, would you tell

me again what is the that you propose?

And I know — I know

10

I'm probably asking you to repeat yourself, but I want to be

11

sure I understand.

12

MR. HAGGERTY:

Yes.

The test is -- the test, the

13

city submits, is for determining whether or not Congress

14

intends that a statute secure rights within the meaning of

15

Section 1983 is whether Congress has employed in the law

sufficiently specific and definite statutory language in order

17

to create rights and at the same time give notice to the

19

such rights.

And as I said, that language does come from a

Congress -- that the — the Congress intended these

benefits — the benefits which Congress intended to confer on

3

the tenants were sufficiently specific and definite to qualify

QUESTION:

Mr. Haggerty, that — that — that has

the poor municipality that doesn't know that it's violating

the federal law and — and, therefore, you shouldn't give

As I say, that has an intuitive appeal up until the

MR. HAGGERTY:

Yes, because that —

Why does that make any sense?
Because, again, it's a question of

whether or not the city has violated or acted in disregard of

the law, and the law in this case does not command the city in

any way to do what the Plaintiff is asserting it should do so

The question is whether or not this law creates that

presented in that way that the NLRB may have come into the

this particular statute does create such rights.

13

In fact, this Court in Owens v. City of Independence

14

look to see whether or not the municipality has conformed to

the requirements of the federal Constitution and statutes.

MR. FASMAN:

Just one or two points, Mr. Chief

Justice.

3

The legislative intent underlying the National Labor

in Machinists, and I think it's important for the Court to

6

bear in mind the broad context of the federal labor laws in

which this case arises.
This Court repeatedly has recognized that free

8

9

collective bargaining is the cornerstone of the federal labor

10

scheme.

11

by Congress if management or labor can be punished for their

12

stance at the bargaining table.
