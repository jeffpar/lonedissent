CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear argument

now in 89-460, Manuel Lujan v. National Wildlife
Federation.
Mr. Roberts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROBERTS;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
This case is here on certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit.

That court held that Respondent had standing to

challenge hundreds of Bureau of Land Management land
orders entered over the course of several years affecting
180 million acres of public lands in 17 states.
The court concluded that a single affidavit of
one of Respondent's members, Peggy Kay Peterson, was
sufficient to confer that standing.

In her affidavit Ms.

Peterson claimed that she used Federal lands in the
vicinity of the South Pass/Green Mountain area of Wyoming,
and she claimed that she was injured by a BLM decision to
open that area to the staking of mining claims.
The district court found that the area in
question covered some 2 million acres, of which only 6,000

1

acres had ever been closed to mining, and of those 6,000

2

the BLM decision only opened 4,500 to the staking of

3

mining claims.

4

The court noted that Peterson's affidavit said

5

nothing about using the 4,500 affected acres and,

6

therefore, concluded that she had shown no injury and that

7

Respondent, therefore, had no standing.
QUESTION:

But she also claimed about lack of

access to information, didn't she?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

That claim was in the Greenwalt

11

declaration, one of the other of the three original

12

affidavits that were submitted by Respondent.

there was that the organization had standing in its own

QUESTION:

Well, it's in your case?

17

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the district

court, we believe, correctly concluded that that

19

declaration, the Greenwalt declaration, was completely

conclusory and devoid of specific facts.

It didn't pass

2

on that, choosing to rest its decision entirely on the

3

Peterson affidavit.

4

The district court, however, did address the

5

Greenwalt declaration and found it, as I've indicated,

6

conclusory and devoid of fact.
It is, as I've mentioned, the Sierra Club case

all over again.

In fact, it's — it's helpful to compare

In the

16

Greenwalt declaration, Ms. Greenwalt claimed that the

17

organization needed information and public participation

18

in order to represent their members.

19

the Morton case said that that sort of interest was

20

insufficient to confer standing because it was in no way

21

be injured and only have standing if she used the 4,500

acres and, therefore, she must have meant to say that she

It

The reasoning was that she claimed that she was

used those 4,500 acres.
This is exactly backwards.

Federal courts are

12

courts of limited jurisdiction.

13

they are without jurisdiction, and the plaintiff must

14

affirmatively prove that he has standing to invoke the

15

power of the court.

16

The presumption is that

The court of appeals presumed Peterson meant to

17

say she used the 4,500 acres because otherwise she

18

wouldn't have standing.

19

she was in the vicinity of this 2 million acre area, not

20

even within the 2 million acres, just in the vicinity.

But what Peterson said is that

21

Even assuming we can place Peterson somewhere

22

within the 2 million acres, the court of appeals had no

23

basis for drastically narrowing the focus of her

24

allegations on the 0.225 percent of that area that was the

25

only area affected by the challenged decision.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Roberts, does the term South

2

Pass/Green Mountains area have some connotation in the

3

BLM's undertaking or was that just an area designated by

4

Ms. Peterson?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

It's an area that's familiar

6

to people in central western Wyoming.

7

area is.

10

QUESTION:

That's what the

Well, I know that, but is it anything

more than just a geographical designation selected by the

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

It is the

12

term that the — the Bureau used in the land use planning

15

referring to is essentially the equivalent of being in the

23

So, even taking the

24

never been any mystery about where these 4,500 acres are.

Therefore, if we're going to indulge in

presumptions, the more reasonable presumption would be

It cited the Federal Register

But neither Peterson nor anyone

Now, the court of appeals compounded its error

14

many times over when it ruled that the Peterson affidavit

15

conferred standing on Respondent to challenge not only the

16

South Pass/Green Mountain order, but hundreds of other BLM

17

orders affecting another 178 million acres of public lands

18

throughout the West — this, despite the fact that the

19

Peterson affidavit said nothing beyond the confines of

20

South Pass and Green Mountain.

21

Respondent's argument on this score is that it's

22

complaining about a program, that BLM has a program to

23

review land classifications and land withdrawals.

But saying they have a program to review land use

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, do we have to know

20

exactly what's challenged by the plaintiffs below in order

21

to answer the question of standing?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The question of

23

standing focuses on whether this particular plaintiff can

24

raise the particular claims in the complaint.

25

very important to focus on what they're complaining about.

statements.

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

That is one of their claims, yes.

And, of course, if the -- if Ms.

Peterson did have standing and was able to argue that

8

point, then it would have an effect nationwide, I assume.

Well, I suppose one of the

MR. ROBERTS:

Your Honor, the failure to prepare

10

an environmental impact statement is not final agency

11

action.

12

final agency action — in this case a land order — is

13

taken, you can then go into court and say I'm affected by

The way that that can be challenged is when the

what the agency did, its final action.
14

15

And the wrong is that they took that action

16

without preparing an environmental impact statement.

17

weren't fully informed as they would be if they had done

18

that.

19

and the fact that there is a — a program or policy, which

is really just saying this is the way the agency goes

about its work, is not enough to confer standing.

1

all of the actions taken nationwide were subject to this

2

court of appeals rule of law.

3

That is to say, if the Court of Appeals of the

4

District of Columbia Circuit were to hold that you had to

5

make the additional publications that are alleged to have

6

been necessary in this case, and if the District of

7

Columbia Circuit had jurisdiction over every order issued

8

nationwide, then presumably the government would have to

9

comply to that — with that order and — with that view of

10

the law unless we took cert, of the case, right?

11
12

MR. ROBERTS:

Certainly true, Your Honor, but

the key is the second predicate to your question.

13

QUESTION:

I understand that.

14

MR. ROBERTS:

If the District of Columbia

15

Circuit had jurisdiction nationwide over all of these land

16

orders.

17

QUESTION:

And if it doesn't, then — then

18

presumably those that are challenged in the — in the

19

District of Columbia Circuit will be governed by that

20

rule, but the government can feel free to use its view of

21

the law elsewhere?

case one district court declares an act of Congress

unconstitutional.

2

be enforced against other people in other districts, and

3

obviously the government tries as quickly as possible to

4

get the case to this Court which has nationwide

5

jurisdiction to decide the issue, but the act is not

6

unconstitutional across the board.

7

QUESTION:

That doesn't mean that the act cannot

It's not really harmless error for

8

the court of appeals to say, well, we really only have

9

this one case before us but, nonetheless, it applies to

10

all cases?
MR. ROBERTS:

11

Well, the court of appeals can say

12

it, but it doesn't apply to all cases.

It only applies to

13

the cases of which the court of appeals has jurisdiction;

14

and, to the extent the court of appeals writes a

15

persuasive opinion, the reasoning of that court will

16

presumably sway other courts when they are confronted with

17

the particular plaintiff suffering particular injury from

18

a particular order.
Now, these principles are particularly important

19
20

in this case because these land orders are not all of one

21

cloth.

They're very different.
To cite just one example, 31 of the challenged

22

23

land orders govern some 5 million acres of land in

24

Montana.

25

land against entry under the Homestead Act.

There were classifications that protected that

You couldn't

1

go in there and set up — your — your homestead.

2

In 1976, however, Congress in the Federal Land

3

Policy Management Act repealed the Homestead Act, so these

4

31 classifications were essentially moot.

5

against a threat that no longer existed.

6

- and terminating those classifications, as the BLM did,

7

couldn't possibly aggrieve anyone.

8

transaction.

9

to challenge those 31 orders based on the Peterson

They protected
They couldn't -

It was a paper

And yet, the respondent was given standing

10

affidavit, which of course had nothing to do with Montana

11

at all.

12

Respondents' theory on this point seems to be

13

that they can bring within to one lawsuit all the agency

14

actions that they think are vulnerable to the same legal

15

theory on which they hope to prevail in the action before

16

the court, but that has never been recognized as

17

sufficient to confer standing —

18

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt for a second?

19

It seems to me that argument goes to the merits, the

20

31 — I mean, maybe she has no right in Montana, but if

21

she has a right even as to 4,500 acres we don't throw her

22

case entirely out of court, do we?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, no, Your Honor.

I

24

wouldn't — if the Court disagrees with us and agrees wit

that Peterson has standing —

QUESTION:

3

Or if there's some other record basis

for standing.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Or any other record basis.

Then — then you lose on the only

6

issue that's before us here.

7

millions and millions of other acres out there somewhere

doesn't seem to me to have anything to do with the

9

standing issue, does it?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

The fact that there are

I think it does, Your Honor.

The

11

question is how far Peterson's standing gets the National

12

Wildlife Federation.

13

QUESTION:

They have standing to challenge —
But if it gets — your — your

14

position doesn't get her one inch into the 180 million

15

acres.

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right.

I don't think she -

QUESTION:

Well, then why do we have to talk

about anything but that one inch?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, if — if — if the Court

agrees with us that Peterson has no standing —

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Right.
— and the Court agrees with us

further that the supplemental affidavits were properly

excluded and the Greenwalt declaration that was discussed

earlier also doesn't establish standing, then you are

2

correct.

5

There's no reason to reach whether that —
QUESTION:

And if we disagree with you on any

one of those three theories, then we reverse — we affirm?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think not, Your Honor.

The

6

court of appeals gave the Federation standing for the

7

hundreds of other land orders affecting all 178 million

8

additional acres.

9

or any of the others, the Federation has shown standing

10
11

If you disagree with us as to Peterson

for those limited orders, those limited parcels.
The question then has to be addressed does that

12

limited standing confer standing for the hundreds of other

13

orders affecting the hundred —

14

QUESTION:

15

them and decide which ones —

16

And we have to sort through all of

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that's certainly what the

17

trial court would have to do if the case were sent back on

18

that basis.

19

QUESTION:

That's the difference between being a

20

trial judge and sitting here.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. ROBERTS:

But the fact of the matter is,

23

understanding doctrine, the plaintiff has to show that he

24

has been injured by each agency action as to which he

25

seeks relief.

The Federation seeks relief, for example,

1

for those 31 land orders I discussed in Montana, but

2

they've not even attempted to show that they've been

3

injured by those, and as I've indicated, I don't think

4

anyone could be injured by those land orders.

5

As the Court noted in Allen against Wright, the

6

standing focuses on whether the particular plaintiff can

7

raise the particular claims asserted.

8

claim that's asserted in this case covers the hundreds of

9

land orders throughout the West, and yet this particular

The particular

10

Plaintiff has shown, we think, standing as to none but, at

11

most, standing as to the particular injury claimed in the

12

affidavits.

13

Now the court of appeals' decision in this

14

regard giving the Federation nationwide standing based on

15

one injury to a particular plaintiff under one land order

16

raises the most serious separation of powers concerns

17

because it aggregates in the district court all of the

18

Bureau of Land Management orders since 1981, even though

19

before that district court is one plaintiff complaining of

20

one order.

21

are precisely what the standing doctrine is designed to

22

avoid.

23

Those types of separation of powers concerns

Turning briefly to the question of the

24

supplemental affidavits, I'd first point out as I

25

mentioned in response to Justice Stevens that those would

1

certainly not end the case even if they were — should

2

have been admitted because they go, again, only to

3

particular plaintiffs' particular land orders.

4

If the Court disagrees with us on those and if,

5

in fact, the supplemental affidavits establish standing,

6

it would only be to the limited parcels, the limited

7

orders mentioned in those affidavits.

8
9

Now, the district court did not abuse its
discretion in declining to admit these affidavits more

10

than one month after the deadline set in Federal Rule of

11

Civil Procedure 56(c) and in violation of the court order.

12

Respondent chose as a deliberate trial tactic over the

13

course of several years to rest on its initial three

14

affidavits and to resist at every turn any further

15

development of the factual record on standing.

16

district court was on the scene and aware of all the

17

circumstances and properly exercised its discretion in

18

refusing to reopen the factual record after the summary

19

judgment hearing.

MR. ROBERTS:

When they realized they were in

endorsed and which Respondents argue for here is just

7

that, the principle that you can come forward with

additional facts whenever you think you're in trouble.

interminable litigation.

No.

I think what —

Or you are sanctioned and reprimanded

for letting — and then the inequity would be eliminated,

14

I assume?

15

MR. PRETTYMAN:

No.

I think what you should do

16

when you send it back is to say that go ahead and allow

17

the defect in standing, if there is any, to be cured the

18

way the court of appeals said that that was the practice

in the District of Columbia.

Defects in the District of Columbia can be cured

Well, Your Honor, that isn't

what the lower courts have said.

13

this Court is going to say, but the lower courts have said

14

that you can — that you can cure these defects and

QUESTION:

It may be that's what

But that isn't before us here.

Here

17

you have a district court judge that did not expressly

18

authorize the filing of supplemental affidavits and that

19

ruled that it wouldn't — they wouldn't be considered.

20
21
22

So the question is whether that amounts to abuse
of discretion.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

The status of the case before

23

you is that the court of appeals has ruled that it was an

24

abuse of discretion of the district court under all of the

25

circumstances here.

Because if we had standing on

The best we can figure from the government's

Now, all right, let me say what I think happened

You're looking at the record as a whole.

Mrs. Peterson swore that she recreated in the

vicinity of South Pass and Green Mountain, where the lands

10

have been open to mining and — and this mining threatens

11

the aesthetics and the wildlife, which in turn harms her.

12

Now that's essentially what she said.

13

Then the government comes along and shows that,

14

indeed, 4,455 acres were open to mining in the South Pass

15

and Green Mountain areas, and that has resulted in 406

16

mining claims being filed and some operations being

17

started, and the government also shows that the mining was

not only — not only can but will — has hurt the wildlife

19

and aesthetics in these very same areas.

But if — so far as they did do it, I mean if

you look at Gladstone Realtors, for example — and that,

14

incidentally, was not a motion to dismiss, that was a

summary judgment case — and the Court said that the

complaints were conclusory in that case, but we're going

to construe them favorably to the Village of Elwood in

that the South Pass/Green Mountain area, the 4,455, the

MR. ROBERTS:

Just a few brief points, Your
