ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HOROWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case concerns the construction of

12

Section 902 of the foreign tax credit provisions of the

13

Internal Revenue Code.

14

corporations to take a credit against the U.S. income tax

15

that is due on certain income dividend income that it

16

receives.

17

of the important term "accumulated profits" in Section 902

18

in a case where the tax laws of the foreign country

19

establish different rules for the computation of profits

20

than do the tax laws of the United States.

21

This section allows U.S.

Specifically, the issue concerns the definition

In this case the British tax laws entitled

22

Respondent to take two large deductions from its income

23

totaling more than three million pounds.

24

stipulated, at page 23 of the Joint Appendix, that these

25

deductions would not be allowable under U.S. tax laws.

The parties have

1

The federal circuit in this case upset the well- settled

2

rule that the term accumulated profits is to be defined in

3

accordance with U.S. tax principles and instead held that

4

it should be determined in accordance with the tax

5

principles of the foreign country.
We believe that the court of appeals' holding is

6

7

clearly wrong and completely undermines the statutory

8

purpose.

9

by describing the statutory framework out of which this

10

To explain why that is so I would like to begin

case arises.

11

When a U.S. company engages in business in a

12

foreign country it is likely to be subjected to tax by the

13

foreign country on the incomes that are earned there.

14

When it reports this income on its U.S. tax return the

15

code allows, the code allows it to take a credit to

16

reflect the foreign tax that has already been paid on the

17

income, and thereby to avoid double taxation of the same

18

income.

19

There are two different ways in which a U.S.

20

company can do business abroad, and they require distinct

21

treatment in the code.

22

agrees here, is that more or less the two different ways

23

of business should be treated the same under the code, and

24

there should be no advantage of doing one business — one

25

way of doing business over the other for foreign tax

But the goal, which everyone

credit purposes.

QUESTION:

3

MR. HOROWITZ:

4

The simplest case is when the U.S. company operates

That is more or less agreed?
I understand that to be agreed, yes.

5

a branch — what is called a branch operation in the

6

foreign country.

7

corporation, no separate taxable entity in the foreign

8

country, the income that is earned in the foreign country

9

flows directly to the U.S. company and it is reported

10

directly on its return as income, and the U.S. company

11

then gets what is called a direct credit under Section

12

901.

13

foreign country on that income is directly credited on its

14

U.S. return.

15

That means if there is just one

The amount of foreign tax that it paid to the

Now, it is significant to note here that all that

16

happens is that the U.S. company takes a number, the

17

amount of British tax that it paid, and puts it on its

18

U.S. return.

19

authorities are not concerned with how the foreign

20

government computed that tax.

21

on the same kind of income that the United States rules

22

would apply, or it could be at a lower rate with a

23

different computation from United States income.

24

makes very — that makes no difference to the branch's

25

reporting on its U.S. return.

It is not concerned, the U.S. tax

It could be at a given rate

But that

1

Now, the other method of doing business overseas

2

would be through a separately incorporated subsidiary.

3

that case you have a different corporation operating in

4

the foreign country, and it is that corporation, not the

5

U.S. parent, that pays the foreign tax.

6

is earned by that foreign corporation, by the same token,

7

does not automatically flow to the U.S. parent.

8

earned by the foreign company.

9

to that income.

10

In

The income that

It is

And two things can happen

Either it can be distributed down to the U.S.

11

parent as a dividend.

12

know, is defined in the Internal Revenue Code as a

13

distribution that is made out of earnings and profits; it

14

is defined by Sections 316 and 312 of the code.

15

distributed as a dividend to the U.S. company it is then

16

reported as income on the U.S. parents t^x return, and it

17

is subjected to U.S. tax.

18

Now, the dividend, as you probably

If it is

On the other hand, the foreign subsidiary may

19

retain the income, not distribute it to the U.S. parent.

20

In that case the income stays in the foreign sub and it is

21

immunized from U.S. taxation.

22

Section 902 is designed to provide an appropriate

23

credit to deal with the subsidiary situation.

24

called the "deemed paid" credit, because it gives the U.S.

25

parent a credit for foreign tax that it is deemed to have

It is

paid, the foreign tax actually having been paid by the

2

subsidiary.

3

the appropriate credit.

4

double taxation and to avoid undertaxation, so as not to

5

give the subsidiary operation an advantage over the branch

6

operation.

7

And the goals of Section 902 are to provide
That means to — both to avoid

Now, I think the boundaries of how Section 2 —

8

Section 902 should operate are fairly clear.

The credit

9

should not be available when all of the sub's earnings are

10

not distributed.

11

subsidiary there should be no credit at that point to the

12

U.S. parent, because the — none of the earnings have been

13

subjected to U.S. taxation and there is nothing to credit

14

against and no possibility of double taxation.

15

If they are retained in the foreign

On the other hand, when all of the foreign

16

earnings, the earnings earned by the foreign sub, have

17

been distributed to the parent, at that point all of the

18

foreign tax that was paid on those earnings should be

19

credited to the U.S. company. At that point that is the

20

close analogy to the branch operation.

21

sub's earnings have been distributed to the parent it is

22

pretty much in the same position as would have been a

23

branch, the branch having gotten the full credit.

24

the start the U.S. parent should now get the full credit.

25

Now, the complication that we have to deal with in

When all of the

From

1

this case arises when the subsidiary distributes only a

2

portion of its earnings and retains some of the others.

3

Clearly, some sort of a partial credit must be given to

4

the parent in that situation, and the code's mechanism for

5

doing that is the allocation formula that we have here in

6

Section 902.

7

our brief, it is a fairly simple formula that sets up a

8

ratio.

9

are paid to the U.S. parent, and the denominator is

Now, the formula is set forth on page 4 of

The numerator of the ratio is the dividends that

10

defined as the accumulated profits of the foreign

11

corporation, that is, after tax — accumulated profits.

12

Now, it is our submission that the profits in the

13

denominator of the fraction must be computed according to

14

U.S. tax principles, just as the profits are that govern

15

the determination of the amount of dividends that will be

16

reported as income on the U.S. return.

17

things that are being compared and the necessary

18

correlation.

19

the amount of the sub's profits that have been

20

distributed, and therefore subjected to U.S. taxation,

21

with the amount of the subs profits that have been

22

retained in the sub, and therefore still immunized from

23

U.S. taxation.

24

denominator must reflect the total amount that is

25

available for distribution to the U.S. parent as a

That is the two

The whole point of the formula is to compare

For the formula to work properly the

1

dividend.

And that number is the profits as determined

2

under U.S. law.
Now, there is one other point that I want to

3
4

explain about the statutory framework, and that is the

5

notion of sourcing, which Respondent discusses at great

6

length in his brief.

7

does not distribute the earnings as they are earned, year

8

by year, but instead accumulates the earnings for a period

9

of time, that in some year it will make a large

It is possible, if the subsidiary

10

distribution of earnings that are greater than its

11

earnings in that particular year.

12

these earnings are to be sourced on a year -- excuse me,

13

these, the dividends distributed is to be sourced on a

14

year by year basis to the earnings of each year.

15

is done according to the statute, Section 902(c)(1) under

16

what we call the LIFO system, that is you start with the

17

current year and then go back year by year exhausting the

18

earnings as you go.

The code provides that

And this

So, for example, if the subsidiary had earned $800

19
20

in

a particular year, and that year distributed $1,000,

21

but it had accumulated earnings from previous years, then

22

$800 of that distribution would be treated by the code as

23

a distribution in the current year.

24

$200 would be treated as a distribution of profits earned

25

in the previous year.

And 200 — the extra

would then be kind of a two-step calculation.

2

get the full credit for the current year of all the

3

foreign tax they paid in that year, because all the

4

profits for that year were distributed.

5

would be treated as having made a $200 distribution in the

6

previous year, and would get a foreign tax credit given to

them by a formula for that year.

QUESTION:

They would

And then they

Well, Mr. Horowitz, I guess you have

conceded that at least in one circumstance, where the —

10

there are no profits under the application of U.S. tax

11

principles for a year, and yet the foreign subsidiary has

12

paid a tax, that there is nothing by way of a credit, and

13

there is in effect double taxation.

14

MR. HOROWITZ:

Is that right?

That is correct.

I mean, we

15

discussed that point at some length in our reply brief,

16

Justice O'Connor.

I mean —

17

QUESTION:

Well, that certainly is a concern.

18

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, it is a concern.

It is

19

something that arises out of the mathematics that when you

20

multiply anything by zero, what you get is zero.

21

say that it is —

22

QUESTION:

I should

Is there no way that the IRS in that

23

situation could devise a means of recognizing foreign

24

losses and carrybacks or something, or some mechanism for

25

adjusting so that you achieve the purpose of the statute?

1

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, there may well be.

As far as I

2

know there has never been any — that issue has never come

3

up in litigation, or litigation that has at least gone to

4

a decision.

5

There are — there was a recent article in Tax

6

Notes which I got a copy of in the mail, and I gather the

7

Court got a copy of in the mail also, which cites a lot of

8

commentators and mentions that a couple of the

9

commentators, although they agree with the government's

10

basic position here that U.S. tax principles govern,

11

believe that there should be some way of taking account of

12

foreign carryback rules.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOROWITZ:

Right.
That's a separate issue.

That is a

15

detail at the margins of the issue, I think, that is

16

presented in this case.

17

for the Court to get into it here.

And I don't think it is necessary

18

I think the zero, the zero income question —

19

QUESTION:

Yes, but it is a concern if you know

20

that the rule you adopt is going to result in some

21

defeating of the statutory goal in some circumstances.

22

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I guess I am not acknowledging

23

that, Justice O'Connor, because the zero — as a practical

24

matter, the zero income case is not going to come up

25

except in the area of a loss carryback.

I mean, there is

1

not going to be a case where they are subjected to a lot

2

of foreign tax and yet there is absolutely no U.S. income

for that year.

is a deviation in the carryback rules of a loss —

QUESTION:

And how do the taxpayers here get in

difficulty with the application of your principle?
MR. HOROWITZ:

The tax — I am sorry, I am not sure

I understand.
QUESTION:

How are the taxpayers here adversely

affected, then, by your interpretation?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, they are not adversely

13

affected at all.

14

they are trying to get a tremendous tax benefit from the

15

rule that they apply.

16

problem in this case, and there is no issue of carryback

17

in this case.

18

deductions, tremendous deductions that they got under

19

British law here are not available at all under U.S. law.

20

They are trying to get a tremendous —

There is clearly no zero income

As I said before, it is stipulated that the

But, just to finish my answer here to your question

21

before, I mean, the zero income thing can come up where

22

the carrybacks are made to different years under different

23

— under the different tax systems.

24

pointing out is that there is more of an argument there,

25

that there is some — that the general principle that U.S.

Is that what it says?
Yes.

Well, it says, it uses the

concept and which is understood to mean the United States

24

principles.

2

ambiguous in the same way the statute is?
MR. HOROWITZ:

No, I don't think it is ambiguous in

3

the same way as the statute is, because the regulation

4

uses a term of art of the United States tax law, earnings

5

and profits, which is the base on which U.S. dividends are

6

paid out of.

7

profits, which appears nowhere else in the code; it

8

doesn't have an established meaning and is, for these

9

purposes, is not defined by the code.

If the statute uses the term accumulated

So, it is left to

10

the parties to fight over what it means.

11

profits is not a term of art in the same sense that

12

earnings and profits is.

13

should mean pretty much the same thing.

14

some things —

15

QUESTION:

But accumulated

It is our argument that it
Congress left

It is the their argument that it is very

16

suggestive that they used the word that isn't used

17

anywhere else in the code, instead of just using earnings

18

and profits, which makes some sense.

19

MR. HOROWITZ:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. HOROWITZ:

Not too much sense, Justice Scalia.

I mean, they — it was necessary to

22

come up with some term there because we are talking about

23

a foreign corporation here.

24

profits would not be meaningful, because foreign

25

corporations —

2

QUESTION:
regulation?

It only makes sense in a Treasury

It wouldn't have made sense in the statute?

3

MR. HOROWITZ:

4

QUESTION:

Well, in the Treasury regulation —

I mean, I don't see why it makes any

5

less sense in -- any more sense in the Treasury reg.

6

just told us it is very clear what it means in the

7

Treasury reg, that there is no ambiguity.

8

said that is ambiguous too, you said no, it is not

9

ambiguous.

10

MR. HOROWITZ:

You

Justice Kennedy

Well, I guess the Treasury reg is

11

issued in the context of a lot of rulings and court

12

decisions already that have discussed this issue.

13

far as the intent of Congress in using this phrase, I

14

think I should make clear that it is not the government's

15

contention that the Congress in 1918 and 1921 sat down and

16

considered the question whether these — these profits

17

will be determined in accordance with U.S. law or in

18

accordance with foreign law, and then decided to use the

19

term accumulated profits.

20

reason to think that the issue occurred to the Congress

21

that there would possibly be a difference.

22

we — we know what the intent of the Congress was,

23

generally, in enacting the credit, and our position is

24

that only by using U.S. profits can that — can that

25

attempt be effectuated.

But, as

I don't think there is any

I think what

Obviously, if Congress was aware

of this litigation, had the prescience to know that this

2

litigation, they would have used a different word no

3

matter who was right in this case.

4

used something ambiguous.
QUESTION:

5

They wouldn't have

I suppose that — don't you — all you

6

have to say is that your construction of the statute is a

7

defensible one or a reasonable one, even if those — even

8

if there is another construction?
MR. HOROWITZ:

9

Well, to the extent — yeah, the

10

administrative construction is entitled to deference.

11

guess we tend to rely, in those cases where we think there

12

is a reasonable argument on the other side.

13

I think it is so clear that the only way of reading the

14

statute is the government's.

But we'll save that

15

ammunition for another case.

But, I agree with you,

16

Justice.

17

I

In this case

There are two ways in which the variation in

18

accumulated profits can affect the computation of the

19

credit.

20

formula that I quoted before for a given year, for a

21

single year's profits.

22

is changed and, as they have done in this case, if the

23

is — the legislative history of the 1921 amendment and

really just the text of the statute makes it clear that

this is the whole point of the allocation formula, is to

fact, the dividends that were paid out by the foreign

either.

4

Now, the way the government allocates these,

5

according to the sourcing is very simple, because under

6

our theory the dividends were always less than the total

7

earnings for that year, so the dividends were just

8

apportioned to the year in which they were distributed.

9

So, the 1971 dividend is fully apportioned to 1971; the

10

1970 dividend is fully apportioned to 1970.

11

calculation is made down at the bottom using the formula,

12

and you see that for — take 1970 as an example, about one

third of the earnings in that year were distributed as a

dividend, and therefore they get about one third of the

way when you use accumulated profits that way, but if they

must look at something that was earned in a prior year.

MR. COUGHLIN:

That is correct.

accumulated was meant to pick up the extent to which you

you could apply the formula and get a credit for the year

And in 1921 they amended the statute and put in

Now, that suggests that perhaps Congress at that

time was thinking of the bucket theory, that we pool all

the taxes together and we pool all the earnings together,

14

and we divide one by the other, and we get kind of an

average rate of foreign tax, which we then apply to the

17

that has been adopted under the 1986 act, which got rid of

profits for that year.
Now, let's go back to the facts for a moment.

3

When

4

Goodyear originally filed its 1970 and 1971 returns, the

5

accumulated profits for each of those years was sufficient

6

to yield a substantial tax credit, without sourcing into

7

any earlier years.

8

paid accordingly.

9

And it recovered credits for taxes

But in 1973 Goodyear England had a loss, which the

10

British tax authorities allowed as a net operating loss

11

carryback deduction for 1971 and 1970.

12

refunds of the foreign taxes that had been claimed as

13

credits for 1970 and 71, but the law required that the

14

entire credit be recomputed at that point.

15

doesn't seem to have been any difference of opinion about

16

the fact that it had to be recomputed, except that the

17

U.S. recomputed it without allowing the carryback

18

deduction because it didn't allow the loss at all.

19

recomputed the 1973 loss and said it was a very large

This resulted in

been if you adjusted neither the numerator or the

2

denominator, or if you adjusted both.

3

Now, keep in mind that of the three factors in the

4

formula, accumulated profits is the only one in dispute.

5

The foreign taxes are facts.

6

The government is making some argument that because the

7

dividends might have been affected by Section 316, but

8

were not, that therefore the numerator is being determined

9

under U.S. law.

The dividends are facts.

It really isn't.

The numerator is being

point because there was something said about this which I

think is a little confusing, about the possibility that

the distribution made — excuse me, that the possibility

4

that the foreign income tax base might have been less than

5

or more than the amount of the taxable dividend or of the

6

earnings and profits, and what the effect might have been.

7

And the fact of it is that under the theory, as we

8

understand it to be, if the accumulated profits, in any

9

sense of the word, should exceed the foreign income tax

10

base, and the dividend also exceeded that amount, then you

11

would carry it back.

12

you would not, because you would have exhausted the

earnings and profits in the dividend you paid, and there

isn't anything left to carryback.

2

This seems to me to suggest that accumulated profits means

3

the foreign tax base, because the taxes are paid on or

4

with respect to that amount.

But Section 902 goes on and

5

defines accumulated profits.

I am going to read part of

6

it.

7

For purposes of this section the term accumulated

8

profits means, with respect to any foreign corporation,

9

the amount of its gains, profits or income computed

10

without reduction by the amount of the income or profits

11

and excess profits taxes imposed on or with respect to

12

such profits or income by any foreign country or any

13

possession of the United States.

Literally, that says that accumulated profits means

gains, profits or income, because it says it means gains,

18

language is clear.

19

be the amount on which the foreign tax was imposed.

would like to say on the side

about part of the argument that was made here for the

government, and that is we have not agreed that the

couple of points.
Respondent at least suggested in its argument that
there might be a question whether under the government's
interpretation Goodyear would ever get credit for all the
foreign taxes that it paid.

There is no question that it

would, as soon as it gets around to distributing all the
income that it has kept in the foreign sub it will get
credit for all the taxes that it paid.

The question here

is whether it can accelerate those credits without
distributing the money that is available for distribution
as dividends.

From the perspective of the U.S. tax code and

the U.S. corporation, all that this language means is that
the, you look to the income for the year, for the foreign
— the income on which the foreign tax is imposed is the
income for that year on which the foreign tax is paid.

If

you look at a branch that has, say, $1,000 in income under
U.S. law, it views the British tax imposed for that year
as being imposed on that $1,000, and it is not concerned
with how the British would compute the income.

And the •

same should be true here.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Horowitz.
