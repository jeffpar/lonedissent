MS. KNEELAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case involves an auto accident in which a group

are not advocating to this Court that the migrant workers

may not sue to get penalties or injunctive relief under the

We are simply saying that the bodily injury claims were

And what we are saying is that private right of action
is not destroyed by our position.

Our position is simply

that the legislature, the Department of Labor, the drafters
of the statute, allowed for an alternative form of obtaining
bodily injury damages through workers' compensation.
QUESTION:

Well, then it-really is quite extraordinary

that it would go ahead and say that the court — not a
commission, but a court can award damages.
