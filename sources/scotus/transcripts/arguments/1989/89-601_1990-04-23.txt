ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LARKIN:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

The Equal Access to Justice Act generally

13

requires the United States to pay reasonable attorneys

14

fees to a prevailing party in a non-tort civil action if

15

the position of the United States is not substantially

16

justified.

17

substantial justification component of that statute

18

applies at the fee stage of litigation, the so-called fees

19

for fees question.

20

The question in this case is whether the

For three reasons we believe that it does.

21

First, the fee stage of the case is part of the overall

22

civil action.

23

part of the civil action, then a prevailing party could

24

not recover attorneys fees for that phase of a lawsuit at

25

all.

Indeed, if the fee stage of a case were not

Second, Congress limited the liability of the

1
2

United States for attorneys fees to those instances where

3

the position of the United States was not substantially

4

justified.

5

United States automatically liable for attorneys fees at

6

any stage of the lawsuit, at the merits or at the fee

7

stage.

8

9

Nothing in the text of the statute renders the

And third, the best reading of the text of the
act, and the one that best serves its purposes, is that

10

the substantial justification requirement applies at the

11

fee stage of a lawsuit.

12

The fee stage and the merit stage are

13

conceptually distinct, the legal issues involved are quite

14

different, and the United States can and often does take

15

different positions in fact and law at each stage of a

16

lawsuit.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what is there in the statute

18

which justifies our making the distinction between the

19

merits stage and the fee stage?

20

stage very adroitly now six times, I've noticed.

21

we going to hear that there is no basis for that

22

dichotomy?

23

MR. LARKIN:

You have mentioned fee
Aren't

No, Your Honor, it is that point

24

where the parties really disagree, and it is that point

25

that I was about to address right now.

Let me do so.

And let's start with the text of the statute.

1
2

And when you look at the statute we think you first have

3

to look at the forest and not just the trees.

4

is the very existence of an attorneys fees statute is

5

significant.

6

partial waiver of sovereign immunity.

7

does is create a new cause of action for a plaintiff and

8

impose a new form of financial liability on the United

9

States.

10

The reason

It modifies the American rule; it's a
What a fee statute

In fact, the version of Section 2412 of the

11

Judicial Code that existed before the EAJA was adopted

12

expressly exempted attorneys fees from the costs that

13

could be awarded against the United States in a lawsuit.

14

The statute itself, therefore, creates an entirely new

15

claim that is separate from the dispute on the merits.

16

Now that is not, we think, a novel proposition.

17

Court's cases, beginning with its 1982 decision in White

18

v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, have

19

recognized that the fee stage of a lawsuit involves

20

different issues, and is —

21

QUESTION:

This

Mr. Larkin, can I interrupt with

22

something that ran through my mind?

23

case in which there is quite a difference between the

24

liability issues and the remedy issues, and you have two

25

separate stages, liability and remedy.

Supposing you have a

And it is

determined that your position on liability was not

2

substantially justified, but there were substantial merit

3

to your objections to the remedy.

4

just get fees for the liability part of the lawsuit?

5

MR. LARKIN:

Would you — would you

Well, that is one way to break the

6

statute down.

7

- excuse me, the liability and relief stages are discrete.

8

And if the United States was not substantially justified

9

at one stage but was at the other, then a party would get

It would be to decide that the merits and -

10

attorneys fees only for that stage where the United States

11

was not substantially justified.

12

There is an even simpler way to break down the

13

statute if you wanted to.

14

to the statute it requires a party to file a fee request

15

within 30 days of the entry of a final non-appealable

16

judgment.

17

What you could -- if you look

You could draw the first line right there.
QUESTION:

I know you could draw the line either

18

of the ways.

19

differentiating between merits and remedy?

20
21

What is your position on the question of

MR. LARKIN:

Well, in most cases there are not

going to be a difference.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LARKIN:

If cases are -The one -- there is -- there will

24

be a category of cases where there is a difference, and

25

that is this category.

If a lawsuit ends in a settlement

1

and the statute uses that term to describe when a

2

lawsuit ends, so it contemplates that a lawsuit can end in

3

a settlement.

4

The consent decree may contemplate that there is future

5

litigation down the road over questions such as whether

6

the United States lived up to its obligations under the

7

decree, whether the decree should be modified or whether

8

the decree should be entirely vacated.

9

The settlement may be a consent decree.

In that sort of circumstance you have a relief

10

part of the action, if you will, that extends well into

11

the future.

12

because in the vast majority of cases what a person is

13

going to be claiming is, for example, an entitlement to

14

benefits that were wrongfully withheld.

15

States pays over those benefits, that's the end of the

16

case as far as what that party was trying to get.

17

Generally we think you can collapse the two,

When the United

Where you have a lawsuit that is going to extend

18

into the future, for example in a prisoners lawsuit where

19

he claims that the law library at a Federal prison was not

20

adequate and a consent decree is entered, you are going to

21

have then litigation extending into the future.

22

think in that case you would have perhaps three lines, not

23

-- not the two.

QUESTION:

And we

But I still don't think I have an

answer to my rather simple question.

claim for Social Security benefit or something like that,

and there is a big fight about liability, and on that

3

position the judge says your position was not

4

substantially justified.

5

the amount of benefits, maybe you get credit for past

6

months or you don't -- you often get that kind of a

7

dispute.

8

substantially justified.

9

that part of the litigation?

10

But you also have a dispute over

And on that issue the government's position was

MR. LARKIN:

Does the plaintiff get fees for

We -- we think that if we were

11

substantially justified in that sort of circumstance on

12

the remedial stage, you wouldn't get fees for that part.

13

But if the Court found that that was too complicated and

14

the Court wanted to collapse the two —

15

QUESTION:

But your position is anything that is

16

severable as to which you have a substantial —

17

substantially justified position, no fees as to that phase

18

of the litigation.

19

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.

But if the Court found that -

20

- like I say, if the Court found that that was too

21

complicated, it could collapse the two into one, draw the

22

first line once the final non-appealable judgment is

23

entered, and consider everything up to that point.

QUESTION:

The former.
Okay.

case would rest and give primary emphasis to that portion

parts of the case in which the prevailing party actually

won?

explained in our opening brief, would be authority for

looking at the statute that way.

2

This statute is unique.

It also adds not only a

but it has a substantial justification inquiry.

5

think the statute can logically be read so that the two

could decide whether someone prevailed at a particular

phase, and even if they did, whether we were nonetheless

You can apply

taking a reasonable position at that stage, either the

11

agency or the United States in court.

And specific provisions of the act we think also

show that the attorneys fee stage is clearly a separate

14

stage of the lawsuit.

15

fees it has to make an inquiry into a variety of different

16

issues that arise only at that stage.

17

typically involve the inquiry whether or not a party was a

18

prevailing party, whether that claimant is eligible for a

19

fee award, whether the number of hours that were spent on

20

the case were adequately documented and are otherwise

21

reasonable and whether there is present in the case a

22

special factor justifying an award of fees in excess of

23

the fee cap, which, due to inflation, is now about $100 an

24

hour.

1

the fee stage is whether the position of the United States

2

was substantially justified, that inquiry, too, is

3

distinct from the one that is made at the merits.

4

Court held in the Pierce v. Underwood case, the question

5

at the merits is whether the government was correct, while

6

the question under EAJA at the fee stage is whether the

7

government's position, although incorrect, was nonetheless

8

reasonable.

QUESTION:

As the

Mr. Larkin, what do you do about the

10

perpetual motion objection that is made here by -- by the

11

respondent?

12

MR. LARKIN:

13

QUESTION:

Your Honor -That is to say it will never end.

I

14

mean, if you get the fees on this basis, then you are able

15

to argue again that whatever fees are awarded below were

16

on the basis of a reasonable opposition by the government.

17

How does it ever end?

18

MR. LARKIN:

Your Honor, my answer to that is a

practical one.

happen.

But

19

the court of appeals looks at all of that, but there is

20

also the question of the fees for the appeal.

Right?

If -- if the court of appeals goes

through all of those inquiries and rules against us on

every one —

the question of whether or not they spent a reasonable

number of hours on the appeal.

3

going to be a very small matter.

4

that the parties are acting in good faith, the only

inquiry at that point a court has to make is whether or

not they spent a reasonable number of hours.

QUESTION:

MR. LARKIN:

Oh, there — there is no inquiry as

Because if you assume

And that, we think, is

I mean, they could find against you

even though you were reasonable.

MR. LARKIN:

Well, that's right.

QUESTION:

19

MR. LARKIN:

Right.
-- that our position -Was wrong.
-- was wrong, and we were

would be entitled to fees in the court of appeals, and the

22

question would just be a reasonable number of hours.

rules against us and says they are eligible for fees, the

2

court of appeals can then ask the parties to submit the

number of hours they reasonably spent on the appeal.

QUESTION:

Suppose the court of appeals doesn't

say anything?

against you on the appeal.

It just -- just says you are wrong, finds

MR. LARKIN:

Well, then the other party is

certainly going to file a request.

9

QUESTION:
MR. LARKIN:

10

And so --

Before the district court.
No, or before the court of appeals.

11

We think before the court of appeals would be the more

12

natural way to do it.

13

Circuit case that rejected the automatic rule, that was a

14

case where the decision was from the NLRB to the court of

15

appeals.

16

Because, for example in the Seventh

Now, there was no district court in that

17

context.

18

And the court of appeals had to make this sort of inquiry.

19

Now, the court of appeals there rejected the automatic

20

rule and found that we were substantially justified in

21

taking the position that we did.

22

23
24
25

The request went back to the court of appeals.

QUESTION:

Is there any question involved here

of fees on appeal?
MR. LARKIN:

Well, the narrow question that the

court of appeals addressed in this case really just dealt

1

with the fees in the district court, because there haven't

2

been any calculation yet or anything made to fees on

3

appeal.

4

QUESTION:

So we are talking about fees for fee

5

litigation in the district court for work done in the

6

district court.

7

MR. LARKIN:

Correct.

That was the holding

8

under the facts of this case.

9

QUESTION:

May I ask —

10

QUESTION:

And you conceded, I take it, or you

11

concede in your brief that the initial work that the

12

prevailing party does to calculate its fees and to make

13

its motion to the district court is compensable.

14
15
16

MR. LARKIN:

Correct.

We thought that that was

a reasonable approach to the statute —
QUESTION:

Well, if -- if — if you say that

17

there are these discrete stages, how does your concession

18

square with your argument that there are discrete stages?

19

MR. LARKIN:

Well, that -- that serves as the

20

bridge from the merits to the fee stage.

21

substantially justified in the merits, then they are

22

entitled to an award of attorneys fees for the merits.

23

QUESTION:

If we are not

And they are entitled to all of the

24

time they expend reasonably in compiling their hours and

25

making their fee request.

Do

you?

3

MR. LARKIN:

4

QUESTION:

5

I didn't know you conceded that.

Well, what we said was -Isn't that a fee on a fee that you

don't want to pay?

6

MR. LARKIN:

No, no.

It is not a fee for the

7

litigation at the fee stage.

8

amount of hours that someone spends putting the fee

request together.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LARKIN:

It is just a reasonable

Well, why isn't it a fee on a fee?
Well, if they are entitled to fees

12

on the merits, we thought that that was best seen as part

13

of the merits.

14

conceded it, but it is not a question of fact, it is a

15

question of law.

think

17
18

Now maybe we were wrong.

I mean, we

And if you think we were wrong, I don't

QUEST I ON:

Well then, what is, what is wrong

with -- what are you complaining about now?

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. LARKIN:

What we're complaining about is

21

this.

When the United States receives a fee request you

22

have to take a position on that request.

23

litigation, we think, from that point on, if we are

24

reasonable in the positions we take, should not be paid

25

entirely by the government for both sides.

And any further

Now, oftentimes if the request is reasonable the

May I ask a question?

How does this

they do it all at once?

MR. LARKIN:

I'm not sure whether there is any

It may turn on whether or not the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I would like to begin by taking up Justice

13

White's point on the fees accrued in litigating the fees,

because that goes to the heart of what this statute is

about.

16

Congress clearly intended to make fee litigants

whole, to the extent that they could under this statute,

18

by awarding them their fees not only for the underlying

19

merits, but for the fees in litigating the fees.

20

do so would undermine the purpose of the act, because it

21

would establish an economic deterrent that this Court

22

noted in Sullivan v. Hudson should not exist.

2

justification, consistent with the statute, like

4

Once that determination is made, just as in Hensley, then

5

it's a matter of the district court's discretion as to

6

what is a reasonable fee.

7

What we are saying is substantial

And on the facts in this case, for example, to

8

the extent that the government won in the court of appeals

9

and to the extent that we then submit other applications

10

for fees for those, the court — the district court judge

11

can take that into consideration and make a determination

12

that we are not entitled for X number of dollars for

13

pursuing one issue that the government won on, but we are

14

entitled to others.

15

What we are saying is not that the district

16

court doesn't have broad discretion, because I think that

was the point of the statute, but that the government

shouldn't be allowed to come in and allege different

What we are

1

saying is that substantial justification is a threshold.

2

We have met that, because you look at the agency's

3

underlying action.

Once that is met —

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KURZBAN:

You get all your fees.
No.

Then the determination is

6

left to the district court as to what a reasonable fee is.

7

Within the rubric of a reasonable fee, as this Court said

8

in Hensley, they can take into consideration whether or

9

not we prevailed, as you are suggesting, on an issue or

10

not.
So the government's worst case scenario is met

11

12

by the fact that the district court judge, or if he is

13

reversed by the court of appeals, the court of appeals can

14

say, under Hensley, we are entitled to no fees at all for

15

pursuing that particular issue.

16

QUESTION:

Well, if the government then says

17

well, we oppose this fee request because we think the

18

hours spent were excessive, or the rate requested is too

19

high, and the district court agrees with them, you're not

20

entitled to fees for defending your submission?
MR. KURZBAN:

21

On those issues, under Hensley,

22

under a reasonableness test, yes, we would not be entitled

23

to it.

24

government's concerns here.

25

consistent with the legislative history of this act.

And I think that is what really meets all the

And

1

I think the clearest example of that, Your Honors, is the

2

case with respect to litigating the fees.

3

case, the actual case that comes before the courts is

4

where a fee is generated of only $4,500.

5

The average

The government, I think, as Justice White was

6

pointing out, the government can then litigate.

And we

7

assume the government in many instances may be reasonable.

8

They may lose, but they are very good lawyers, they can

9

fashion very reasonable arguments.

And in the process of

10

doing that they can run up enormous fees, far beyond the

11

average fee in an Equal Access to Justice Act case.

12

that fee is $4,500; 90 percent of the fees in Equal Access

13

to Justice Act cases are less than $3,000.

14

And

So if the government has an interesting issue,

15

as they did, for example, in Sullivan v. Hudson, where the

16

lawyer as a matter of record had to drop out of the case,

17

because the government took that all the way to this

18

Court, where the government has an interesting issue and

19

they wish to pursue it all the way to the Supreme Court,

20

the fee litigant is going to be discouraged from taking

21

those kind of cases.

22

And the thought of Congress here is we want to

23

encourage people to take cases.

We want to make sure that

24

they don't feel that there is a tremendous risk that down

the road the government will litigate against them for -35

And if this

Well, assuming the hypothetical,

11

and obviously we don't want to concede that, but assuming

12

what Your Honor is saying is correct, I think the answer

13

is that no, the substantial justification threshold would

14

not apply, because it would defeat the very purpose of the

15

act for the very reasons that you have suggested.

is it would allow the government to litigate issues

What we are dealing with here is a problem that arises at
the back end.

3

Congress wanted the same answer to apply in both

circumstances where there are different problems.

anything, the 1985 amendment actually helps us in a way,

because it indicates that there are two positions that

The second point I would like to make is just

that we think the statute has to be read so that the

have to be read reasonably, because the statute uses them
