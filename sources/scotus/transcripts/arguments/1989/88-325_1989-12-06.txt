ORAL REARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I'm afraid I'm inflicted with laryngitis today

11

12

and I ask the Court's patience with me although you should

13

certainly feel free to ask questions, but I may be a

14

little slow in responding to them.

15

We've just heard an interesting argument on the

16

perplexing question whether and under what circumstances

17

federal law may require refunds of unconstitutional state

18

taxes.

19

It's useful to have in mind in approaching this

20

case why that question is important to McKesson but not

21

here.

22

clearly-established law factor because in this case too we

23

have the second issue, the post-Scheiner tax collections

24

which I think plainly violated clearly-established law

25

laid down in Scheiner.

The difference in the two cases is not based on the

3

In fact, the difference between our case and

1
2

McKesson is that our case was a true retroactivity case

3

and I don't think McKesson is.

4

up this difference is that retroactivity tells you what

5

substantive law governs a case, whereas, the law of

6

remedies assumes that there has been a substantive

7

violation and asks what type of relief is appropriate.

Now, the best way to sum

8

So, the Florida Supreme Court's basis for its

9

decision in McKesson I think had nothing to do with the

10

notion that there had been a change in law and that

11

Florida was entitled to rely on some prior rule of law.

12

Rather, the court held that even though the

13

statute may have been clearly unconstitutional from the

14

very moment of its enactment, McKesson was not entitled to

15

refund relief because of the nature of injury or lack of

16

injury that it suffered by virtue of the Commerce Clause

17

violation.

18

Now, whether the Florida court was talking about

19

state or federal law when it was making that ruling, you

20

can overturn that ruling only by finding that there is a

21

federal right to some refund relief in the circumstances

22

of the McKesson case.

23

In our case, however, the ruling of the Arkansas

24

Supreme Court that the interstate truckers should not

25

receive refunds of pre-escrow tax payments is based on a

1

non-retroactivity determination under this Court's Chevron

2

test.

3

What the Arkansas Supreme Court effectively held

4

is that Aero Mayflower provides the substantive Commerce

5

Clause rule that would govern Petitioner's refund claims

6

until August 14th, 1987 when Justice Blackmun entered his

7

escrow order, and that the principles of Scheiner would be

8

applied to HUE taxes collected after that date.

9

This is not in any sense a ruling that

10

unconstitutional state highway taxes are not refundable in

11

Arkansas because of sovereign immunity, or for any other

12

reason.

13

tax payments were refunded, shows that Arkansas law does

14

give petitioners a right to refund of taxes to which the

15

principals of Scheiner are applicable.

16

Quite to the contrary.

The fact that post-escrow

The refunds were denied here because in effect

17

the highway tax at issue was treated as having been

18

constitutional prior to the time of Justice Blackmun's

19

escrow order.

20

Now, contrary to the arguments of respondents

21

and their amici, the question of which substantive

22

Commerce Clause governs here, the Aero Mayflower rule or

23

the Scheiner rule, is surely one of federal law.

24

while retroactivities and right to refunds may be related

25

from a practical standpoint, the choice of the proper

And

1

substantive rule is conceptually quite distinct from the

2

question of whether a violation of federal law gives rise

3

to right to refund.

4
5
6
7

So, with that underbrush I hope cleared away,
let me turn to the retroactivity question in our case.
QUESTION:

Do you think — do you think that

Arkansas makes any different claims now on reargument?

8

MR. FREY:

From what it did before?

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

10

MR. FREY:

I think it has a — an argument based

11

on Union Gas and the powers of Congress and the powers of

12

this Court, which I think is new.

13

largely rearguing Scheiner, which I think is what it did

14

before, on the merits of the retroactivity issue.

15

Otherwise, I think it's

Now, I'm going to talk in terms of the Chevron

16

test because that is the test that this Court has devised

17

for deciding whether a given rule is substantive federal

18

law, and by this I include such things as statutes of

19

limitations for this purpose, which was what was at issue

20

in Chevron — what applied to events that occurred prior

21

to the date of the case that decided that rule of law.

22

The first thing I want to say about it is that

23

in the particular context where the proponent of non­

24

retroactivity is the government, this Court has had some

25

revealing things to say on that subject in the Owen case.

1

I understand the Owen case involved municipality and not

2

the state, and it involved the statutory right under 1983,

3

but the way the Court went about identifying the question

4

whether there should be an obligation to make the citizen

5

whole for a violation of his constitutional rights, even

6

where it was not clear at the time the government action

7

took place that it was illegal, is illuminating in our

8

case.

9

And, indeed, if you look at the state's briefs

10

in this case, you will find that Owen is nowhere cited or

11

discussed in their briefs.

12

13

Now, the Chevron test identifies three factors
that go into the retroactivity analysis.

14

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt for a second,

15

Mr. Frey.

16

government is a proponent of non-retroactivity.

17

course, that's typical in all criminal retroactivity

18

cases, that the government is always — always the

19

proponent of non-retroactivity.

20

You make a big point of the fact that

MR. FREY:

Of

And the criminal rule is that — is

21

now that all decisions are fully retroactive to cases that

22

are pending on direct appeal.

23

QUESTION:

Do you argue for such a rule here?

24

MR. FREY:

Excuse me?

25

QUESTION:

Do you argue for a comparable rule

here?
MR. FREY:

2

No, we don't.

We don't.

I think

3

what we are actually saying — we are not asking the

4

Court, and we don't think the Court needs for this case,

5

to go so far as to say that the government always loses

6

when it's seeking non-retroactive application of some

7

constitutional rule.
We do say that if you look at a case like ours

8

9

in which the rule is arguably new and arguably not new,

10

foreshadowed but — and the state is able to say it wasn't

11

clear that we were acting unconstitutionally when we acted

12

and, therefore, we shouldn't have to apply the new rule to

13

the old case —• I think Owen gives grounds for healthy

14

skepticism about that argument.

15

entirely —

16

QUESTION:

It's a factor that weighs

The question I'm raising is — I

17

suppose there are always two questions.

One, is it

18

retroactive, and if so, from what date?

And, secondly,

19

what does that mean?

20

before the date or the highway is used before the date or

21

cases pending on the date?

22

can fall from that.

23

MR. FREY:

I think in that — in the tax —

MR. FREY:

Well, I will tell you what — our

2

position is that if it were non — if it's retroactive,

3

it's presumably retroactive to any cases that are still

4

under litigation or open under the statute of limitations

5

where state procedural rules have been met and you're

6

suing for a refund.

7

If it is partially non-retroactive, which is our

8

second issue, the post-Scheiner payments, we would say

9

that the question is when did the transaction occur that

10

was subject to the tax — before or after the new rule?

11

So, if the tax is imposed for highway use after June 23rd,

12

1987, we would say that that's not a question of

13

retroactivity.

That's a refusal to give prospective

extent of justifiable reliance on the old rule — and I've

17

talked a little bit about that; the extent of the policy

18

that underlies the new rule, if, indeed, we have a new

19

rule; and the equitable considerations.

20

And let me talk first about the equities because

21

I think they're quite striking in this case and quite

22

easily misunderstood.

23

First of all, the Court has made clear that the

24

burden of persuasion with respect to the equities is on

25

the proponent of non-retroactivity because the normal

We're dealing here with taxes that are paid

What happened under the old tax was that the

1

the refunds by non-discriminatory new taxes is to redress

2

the past discrimination by making those who were unjustly

3

enriched by the unlawful features df the tax repay those

4

who were its victims.

5

In addition, the burden on the state of the —

6

having to make a tax refund is — can easily be and is

7

exaggerated by my opponent because he refuses to consider

8

the possibility of stretching out the refunds over a

9

period of years using credits, using bonding as a means of

10
11

financing the refunds and spreading out the impact.
On the other side of the equation let's look at

12

it from the standpoint of the taxpayers.

13

Arkansas Supreme Court suggested that there was a windfall

14

to petitioners, we believe it's quite clear that there is

15

no windfall on either of two grounds.

While the

16

One ground that was offered was that we, after

17

all, got to use the highways that were improved with the

18

tax monies that we paid.

19

we are not seeking — we don't say we have a right to a

20

refund of our fair share of taxes.

21

that were fairly related to our highway use.

22

And, of course, that's true and

That is, the taxes

The problem here is that we were asked to pay

23

taxes for their highway use, and it seems to us that from

24

an equitable standpoint, there is no excuse for not making

is, as I think Justice Stevens makes quite clear during

2

the preceding argument, is they can't — like the orphan

3

who killed his parents and pleads for mercy, they can't

4

say, well, the only remedy we have is a full refund and it

5

would be unequitable to give a full refund so we're going

6

to give nothing.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

MR. FREY:

I don't think that's an acceptable

9

approach.

And that was the second point that I was going

10

to make, which was the suggestion that the refund — to

11

give us full refunds would be excessive.
This Court does not have to decide that

12

13

question.

14

this Court is what rule of substantive law governs our

15

claim for refunds: Scheiner, Aero or Mayflower?

16

The only question this — that's now before

If Scheiner is the rule, then we go back to the

17

Arkansas courts and we see what we're entitled to under

18

the legal exactions provision of the Arkansas Constitution

19

for a tax that violated our rights, that violated the

20

Federal Constitution.

21

Now, the fact that we suffered a real and

22

substantial injury in this case is undeniable and it's

23

made clearest — or, most simply made clear from the fact

24

that when they were forced to pass a non-discriminatory

25

tax that didn't have the flat feature, the rate was two

and a half cents per mile even though more than three-

2

quarters of the members of the plaintiff class paid the

3

full five cents a mile under the old tax.

4
5

So, it's clear we were paying at least twice as
much as we should have been paying.

6

Now, let me turn to the first prong of the

7

equation.

8

whether there is a new rule, whether there was justifiable

9

reliance by the state.

That is, the right to — the question of

need to remember that the general rule is full

rare exception.

whether I'm being responsive to your question.

1

Well, if in considering the remedy we

2

are concerned about massive financial costs to the state,

3

it might exert a kind of pressure on courts to find non­

4

retroactivity .
MR. FREY:

5

Well, let me say this, Justice

6

O'Connor.

I think it's fair — I think that -- why I

7

started the argument the way I did is that there may be

8

reasons why the state should not have to — or should not

9

want to — and be required to pay refunds.
I don't think the retroactivity test should be

10
11

twisted as a way to be — to concern itself with that.

12

You ought to look at the law of remedies.

suggestion that at least in this area that we are dealing

Mr. Frey, isn't it possible in this

all-or-nothing approach.

And they said, well, we'll chop

10

it off at Justice Blackmun's escrow order and the refund

11

will therefore be $4.9 million instead of a hundred and

12

fifty or something like that.

13

Isn't it possible that under the different ways

14

of computing the retroactive refund that you claim that

15

you might even lose some money?

clear —this is getting to the — they gave you $4.9

ORAL REARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

12

13
14

MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to begin with an argument that is

15

very prominent in petitioner's contentions here, and I

16

think it reveals a good deal about what is really at stake

17

here and what the issues are.

18

The petitioners have said time and again, not

19

only in this case but also in their amicus brief in the

20

companion case, that retroactive awards payable from the

21

State Treasury of Arkansas are needed to deter, as they

22

put it — and I quote — the impulses of the state

23

legislators, impulses to violate the Commerce Clause.

24

They say this is one of the reasons that we have to apply

25

Scheiner retroactively.

Yet, at this late date, and even today, my

1
2

opponent has sat down — we have yet to receive an

3

explanation of why the Arkansas legislature should be

4

chastised for what it did in 1983.
As the Court will recall, at the time of the

5
6

enactment of this tax, the outstanding decisions of- the

7

Court, the Aero Mayflower line of cases, were clearly in

8

favor of the constitutionality of the tax.

9

More than that, the lower courts throughout this

10

country — that's both federal and state courts — were

11

bound to adhere to the Aero Mayflower line of cases.

12

opponent mentioned the Rodriguez decision last term.

13

Rodriguez says what we said in our brief, that the Supreme

14

Court of the United States retains the exclusive privilege

15

of overruling its own decisions.

said that that should not have been done — this Court

MR. RANDOLPH:

2

QUESTION:

3
4
5
6

No, no.

Once you've overruled —

Well, hasn't Scheiner made it very

clear that Aero Mayflower was no longer law?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Ah.

Well, my point may be

alluding — I may be confusing the Court.
My point is this.

That the petitioners in this

7

case want to hold the Arkansas legislature to a higher

8

standard, a different standard, than is applicable to the

9

nation's judiciary, because they want the Arkansas

10

legislature to anticipate the course of constitutional

11

decision-making that this Court has engaged in under the

12

Commerce Clause.

13

And if they anticipate incorrectly, as they did

14

in 1983, the sanction is to open up the treasury of

15

Arkansas to these petitioners and grant them refunds.

16

QUESTION:

Well, I — I take it you concede that

17

Mr. Justice Blackmun had — and this Court — had the

18

authority to order the escrow?

19

MR. RANDOLPH:

That's an injunction order

20

against the State of Arkansas, and I think that under the

21

line of decisions — and I'll get to the Eleventh

22

Amendment — that injunctions order — injunction orders

23

giving perspective relief would be permissible.

24
25

QUESTION:

And after that point any collection

of the tax would have been illegal?

MR. RANDOLPH:

2

After that point that is right,

that is right.
And what that means is that if the elected

representatives of the people don't combine the talents of

5

a law professor and a soothsayer, then the people of the

State of Arkansas are going to suffer either increased

QUESTION:

Well, but is that fair, Mr. Randolph?

9

Supposing there had never been a Scheiner case and they'd

10

just filed the case in Arkansas, are you saying you would

11

have won the case?

12

MR. RANDOLPH:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

Oh, you don't think we would have

14

applied the same principles we applied in Scheiner in this

case if the Arkansas case had gotten there — had gotten

10

authorities in Arkansas have the duty and the authority

MR. RANDOLPH:

I think they have to follow the -

14

- when a case is under advisement in this Court or the

15

Arkansas courts, and there is a contention between parties

16

about whether the tax is unconstitutional, I think the

17

Arkansas authorities have to continue abiding by their

legislative direction until the Court says otherwise.

close of my argument if I may.
But I think the issue that Mr. Frey wants the

3

Court to decide is coming in here under a verbal disguise.

4

On the one hand, we're told the Court doesn't have to

5

decide whether there is a federal right to a refund

6

remedy, and, on the other hand, I notice the last time we

7

were here Mr. Frey ended his argument by saying there is

8

such a right.

9

And the Court doesn't even have to decide what -

10

- who among petitioners is entitled to it or what the

11

measure of relief is.

12

whether Scheiner is retroactive.

13

All the Court has to decide is

But when my opponents get to the point of

14

explaining why Scheiner is retroactive, they find

15

themselves in a state of perplexity, because their reasons

16

why Scheiner is retroactive rely on the very points they

17

say the Court doesn't have to decide.

18

And

It

1

Now, what they ignore in all these arguments, it

2

seems to us, is — and they raise fundamental questions

3

about the relationship between state and federal

4

governments and the role of this Court in that

5

relationship.

6

It is, I think, fair to say, and the Court has

7

said it many, many times, that it would be very unusual —

8

rare — to find a federal monetary remedy imposed on state

9

treasuries.

That is a rare occurrence.

10

It is contrary — and the Court has said this

11

many, many times — to the usual constitutional balance

12

between state and federal governments.

13

governments respect the immunity of the federal

14

government, and the federal government respects the

15

immunity of the state governments, and that's the balance.

The tradition is as old as the Constitution.

Hamilton talked about it in the Federalist No. 81.

might add, if the arguments that we're hearing here today

about how this Court ought to impose monetary liability on

its state treasury of Arkansas had been made at the time

MR. RANDOLPH:

2

QUESTION:

—■ basis of retroactivity.

Even though the denial — you're

3

saying it cannot base the denial of a substantive right

4

upon misinterpretation of federal law, but it can base the

5

denial of a remedy upon misinterpretation of federal law?
MR. RANDOLPH:

6

If it does, the Court could give

7

an opinion and say, as I would request the Court to do,

8

that federal law is indifferent, that federal law is

9

neutral, that federal law does not require or does not

10

deny.

And this, the Supreme Court says, is a matter of

11

solely for state governments.
And I might add, if — if in Union Gas, the

12

13

Court applied stringent standards of interpretation, no

14

implication to federal statutes, then the question here is

whether the Supreme Court will apply those standards not

That was

2

another case.
MR. RANDOLPH:

You cannot take the Commerce

3

Clause, which says Congress has the power to regulate, and

4

imply from that a right of action on the basis that

5

somebody's constitutional rights were violated, and it

6

must be assumed — implied — that the framers of the

7

Constitution, in saying Congress can regulate, said what

8

they really meant was the Supreme Court can open up state

9

treasuries.

10

The two don't go together.

And so you cannot

11

use that whole line of implication cases to come to the

12

conclusion, regardless of the Eleventh Amendment, that the

13

Commerce Clause has a policy in favor of deterring state -

14

- that the Commerce Clause has a policy of opening up

state treasuries.

It doesn't.

From their opinion the assumption is

QUESTION:

The judgment was $4.9 million of

And that, itself, is inconsistent with your notion that

they won't give any refunds.
