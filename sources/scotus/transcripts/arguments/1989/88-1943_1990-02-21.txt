ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an estoppel case.

The issue is whether

12

the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the

13

Civil Service Disability Retirement System, is estopped

14

from applying and enforcing a statute passed by Congress

15

on account of misinformation, misinformation provided both

16

orally and in writing in the form of an outdated 0PM form,

17

which was furnished and provided to Mr. Richmond in San

18

Diego by Navy civilian personnel.

19

It is our position that the court of appeals

20

erred in applying estoppel over Judge Mayer's dissent.

21

But more than that, it is the submission of the United

22

States that estoppel does not and indeed properly cannot

23

run against the government in the execution of laws passed

24

by Congress.

25

Indeed, for almost two centuries this Court was

clear and emphatic that the government, acting as it must

2

through its employees and agents, cannot be estopped from

3

asserting its rights and executing the law, subject always

4

to the overriding demands of the Constitution.

5

Across the judicial generations beginning with

6

Chief Justice Marshall's Court in 1813 in Lee against

7

Monroe and Thornton; in the wake of the Civil War in 1868

8

in the Floyd Acceptances case; the turn of the century in

9

Pine River Logging Company; at the close of World War I in

10

Utah Power and Light; and in more modern times, Justice

11

Douglas' opinion for the Court in Untied States against

12

Stewart; and Justice Frankfurter's opinion in what has

13

become viewed as the seminal case in this area, Federal

14

Crop Insurance Corporation against Merrill.

15

Through all these generations, the Court was

16

clear and it was consistent that in the execution of

17

public law the government, in contrast to a private party,

18

cannot be estopped.

19

reasons, both legal and practical, why this historic

20

principle is sound.

21

And in our view there are powerful

The legal reasons are found in basic principles

22

of democratic theory, and the very nature of our system of

23

divided powers among co-equal branches.

24

held in INS against Hibi, and then reiterated less than

25

two years ago in INS v. Pangilinan, estoppel, a venerable

That is our first point and it's our most

Branch to deliberately try to thwart the policies set by

14

Congress, for example, in a benefit program, if the

15

Executive thought that program was unwise and unfortunate

16

and, therefore, in their policy they would just make it a

17

policy not to tell people about deadlines, or do anything

18

they could to discourage people from taking advantage of

19

the program Congress has set up.

20

I suppose it might be possible for the Executive

Now, under your theory, no estoppel is possible

21

And yet under those circumstances the Executive would be

22

thwarting the will of Congress.

23

MR. STARR:

Under those circumstance I would

24

quite agree that the Executive would be actively seeking

25

to subvert the will of Congress.

That was the view of

QUESTION:

3

MR. STARR:

But there would still be no estoppel.
Yes.

In our view there would still

4

be no estoppel.

In fact, that was the view of several

5

members of this Court in the Hibi case.

6

Executive was deliberately not carrying out the will of

7

Congress.

That the

And yet this Court determined that estoppel

And there is a reason for that.

If, in contrast

10

to the run-of-the-mill case -- and we believe this is,

11

while very unfortunate for Mr. Richmond, a run-of-the-

12

mill case of error — of what Justice Frankfurter in

13

Merrill called "ignorant innocence."

There was no

That is the run-of-the-

If, in fact, there were at higher levels of the

19

Executive an effort to thwart the law, then it seems to

20

us, and we submit to the Court, that the appropriate place

21

for redressing that kind of grievance is in the Congress.

22

That Congress itself knows full well how to step in,

23

either through public law, passing a public law to address

24

what Congress perceives as a subversion of its will --

1

same if there were an active intentional

2

misrepresentation?

3

MR. STARR:

Under our theory, that is correct.

4

Even if it is knowing and intentional.

That is not the

5

run-of-the-mill case, I hasten to add.

But our theory of

6

the case is quite right.

7

where there is active subversion for that — for that —

8

to be given effect by the courts.

9

In fact, it is all the more odd

It seems to us that the appropriate province of

10

Congress is to address that sort of situation.

11

hasten to add that in none of the cases, save for Hibi,

12

has that extreme example even been suggested, although

13

there have been actions by very senior officials of the

14

government that have been called into question, such as in

15

the Floyd Acceptances case.

16

of War himself was said to give rise to an estoppel.

17

QUESTION:

The action of the Secretary

Well, at some point acts -- acts of

18

government officials can deprive someone of a

constitutional right then?

Well, what if that had been just a

civil case that you were trying to recover from -- from

8

that -- from that particular party the costs of removing

some obstruction and yet the -- and yet the party had been

10

affirmatively misled by that regulation?

11

result would have been different if that would have been a

12

civil case?

13

MR. STARR:

Not in a civil case.

If in fact the

14

regulation were unlawful under governing statute, I think

that would be — that would be the key question.

In our judgment,

You couldn't — you couldn't fine him

on the criminal case but you could make him -- you could

6

recover a large sum of money from him in a civil case?

7

MR. STARR:

I think that's right.

And the

8

reason is PICCO itself made clear that the criminal

9

justice system carries with it fundamental notions of

10

elementary fairness and entrapment, and that an individual

11

should not earn entity in that case, should not be

12

summoned to answer criminally and then convicted for a.

crime if the law was not in fact clear.

forfeiture of the remaining pension, you couldn't have —

1

government's representations in this instance rose nearly

2

to the level as the formality of formal interpretations

3

that were before the Court in PICCO.
That is to say, no, I don't think that a low-

4
5

level -- with all respect to the Navy civilian personnel

6

— I don't think that a low-level civilian employee of the

7

Navy in San Diego has the power, has the authority, to

8

override the law.

And I don't think it is reasonable.

We presume in our system of a rule of law that

individuals inform themselves of what the law is.

11

make it quite clear that individuals rely, by virtue of

12

the venerable principle of no estoppel against the

General Starr.

7

MR. STARR:

8

9

May it please the Court, Mr. Chief

Justice:
This case, as Judge Mayer put it aptly in

10

dissent, is strikingly similar to this Court's case in

11

Schweiker against Hansen.

12

controls this case in terms of erroneous advise by the

13

government, simply cannot, as a matter of law, work or

14

constitute the grounds for an estoppel.

15

And we believe that that case

And in this case it is quite clear that the

16

court of appeals order in this case to the MSPB will

17

require ultimately 0PM to violate the law.

18

At page 23 of our brief we set forth the

reformulated statute, the rewritten statute that now

We believe that there are practical reasons

18

quite in addition to fundamental legal issues of reasons

19

of separation of powers and sovereign immunity, as we set

20

forth more fully in our brief.

And the basic point in this respect was made

22

over 150 years ago by Justice Story in the Kirkpatrick

case, and we cite this at page 35 of our brief.

Justice Story's words, written in obviously a

decided quieter time, have even more force today.

agencies so numerous and so scattered that the utmost

vigilance would not save the public fisc from the most

serious losses.

The result is, as two members of this Court
noted in 1981, that there is not much guidance that has
been provided by this Court, with all respect, to the
lower courts.

And the federal courts, as we set forth

particularly in our petition for certiorari, are frankly
all over the law.

MR. DEFORD:

1

The PICCO case was a criminal case,

2

but there's been no indication, other than the statement

3

today in open Court, that that should make any difference.

4

PICCO involved a for-profit sophisticated corporation

5

which followed exactly what Mr. Merrill -- Mr. Richmond

6

followed -- followed what the agency said was the law,

7

whereas in fact the law was otherwise.

But -- but that was the case, wasn't

it?
MR. DEFORD:

It was a regulation and the

agency's regulation was wrong, as this Court determined.

17

And, therefore, the Court held that the — that the

18

corporation was not bound by what the law actually said.

19

It was only bound by what the agency had said the law was,

20

which directly contradicts the extreme holding in Merrill.

21

This court in Merrill had held that we are

22

always presumed to know the law and, therefore, it didn't

23

matter what you heard from the government because it's

24

what you are presumed to know which counts.

directly contradicts that because in PICCO they followed

MR. DEFORD:
QUESTION:
MR. DEFORD:

In the Schweiker v. Hansen case?
Yeah.
One, that involved a low-level

employee giving information — giving oral -- giving one
oral response to an individual who was not vested in
benefits.

In this case, the information came from the

agency itself.
QUESTION:

Well, that would ordinarily go to the

reasonableness of the reliance, I would think.

There was

no contention in Schweiker that the -- the agent couldn't
speak for the agency, was there?
MR. DEFORD:

Well, there has been a dispute here

about -- about reasonable reliance.

But if you're

speaking of affirmative misconduct, which is the other
element that this Court has suggested must be shown for
estoppel against the government, the affirmative
misconduct here, as opposed to in the Schweiker v. Hansen
case, is that it came from the agency.

It was the agency

who gave out the wrong information, not the low-level
employee.
QUESTION:

But I would think if -- if it's

affirmative misconduct to give out bad information, in one
case the agency was guilty of affirmative misconduct, in
the other case an employee of the agency was guilty of it.
MR. DEFORD:

Honor, is that in Hansen it was one person coming in
asking a question, there was some confusion as to the
nature of the question, as to the issues.

The individual

employee gave out an answer, the individual was not
following the policy of the agency.
Affirmative misconduct has generally been
interpreted by the lower courts as requiring something
more than mere negligence.

And I think what took place in

the Hansen case was mere negligence by one employee.
took place in this case was something greater.

What

In

fact, -QUESTION:

Well, why do you say -- are you --

are you suggesting it was intentional misconduct here?

know.

behavior.

QUESTION:

Well, how can you —

How can you tell that?
I think the distinction is that

here it was the agency which misbehaved, which sent out
the wrong information and which left it out there for very
many years.

In Hansen, it was a one time only mistake

responding to one question from one individual.

of estoppel because that has often proven to be a problem

3

in obtaining an estoppel from this Court.
The government admits that most of the elements

there was a misrepresentation, and there was detriment to

the person who relied on that misrepresentation.
The only dispute here on the traditional

elements is whether or not the behavior was reasonable,

10

whether Mr. Richmond was reasonable in relying on what the

The government, in fact, does not dispute that

12

13

as a matter of fact the reliance was reasonable.

entire argument is based on a legal fiction.

on the legal fiction that everyone is presumed to know the

It's based

I'm speaking to that now because that has proven to be a

22

It was a totality of circumstances type of
analysis.

And I think that's the appropriate type of

analysis that should be used whenever we're determining
whether there was reasonable reliance on a
misrepresentation by the government.
I suggested earlier one problem of using the
strict presumed to know rule would be that we could all be
required to have lawyers every time we call up any
government agency.
I think perhaps an even more important
consequence of applying that strict rule would be to erode
further the confidence in government.

If every citizen

knew that the legal fiction is that we are all presumed to
know the law and that it's always unreasonable to rely on
the government, then I think confidence in government
would go down somewhat.
So I think this Court has indicated since the
Merrill decision that reasonable reliance is determined
based on the facts on the totality of circumstances and
not merely on some maxim which no longer has any validity.
In this case there should be no doubt that Mr.
Richmond did reasonably rely.

He went to his former

employer, he went to the division of the Navy which had
always handled his retirement, which had dealt with the
issue in the past.

He asked specific questions.

caused this Court not to reach the ultimate issue of

20

whether there could be estoppel against the government is

21

what is known as affirmative misconduct.

22

the traditional estoppel issues.

23

There is some tension, as obviously this
discussion has indicated, between sovereign immunity,
separation of powers, and the concept of equitable
estoppel.

And by adding this additional level that an

individual must demonstrate, I think this Court has made
it very clear that it's possible for that tension to be
worked out.
People who might be able to demonstrate just the
traditional elements of estoppel will not necessarily be
able to show affirmative misconduct.

But those who can

show affirmative misconduct, will have demonstrated that
they're entitled to estoppel against the government.
Unfortunately, like many equitable terms,
i

affirmative misconduct has not been clearly defined.

But

I think that is the nature of equity in general and that
is the nature of estoppel.

It's a balancing test to

determine when you have affirmative misconduct.

At a

minimum, as. I suggested, it does require more than
negligence.

The lower courts are in pretty much agreement

on that.
The court below and many commentators have
suggested the level of reckless — reckless behavior.

And

I think that's an appropriate level.

MR. DEFORD:

It would include both negligent and

For

So I

think that's a good reason why we should continue to use
this narrow remedy of estoppel and not compare it to the
— to the tort misrepresentation.
Again, let me emphasize on the affirmative
misconduct issue.

The Agency here, Office of Personnel.

Management, had a special obligation and that's why their
behavior is -- is especially disturbing.
There was a change in law here.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

With respect factually to what OPM did, in our
reply brief at pages 10 and 11, including footnote 11, we
set forth in brief fashion what happened here.
OPM did, promptly after OBRA was passed in
September of 1982, circulate information to the effect
that the law had changed to the various civilian employers
of the federal government.

Those — that information was

in fact received by the Department of the Navy.
OPM, for its part, no longer has responsibility
or control.

This was a Navy problem.

So, just to clarify

the record in terms of OPM.
Now, we've heard a lot about the OPM form and
the information that -- quote -- OPM is giving out.
wasn't giving out this form, this was from the Navy.
