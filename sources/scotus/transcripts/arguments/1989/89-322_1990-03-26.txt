ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. COHEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case the United Steelworkers of America

13

negotiated a collective bargaining provision with the

14

Sunshine Mining Company giving the union the right to

15

accompany a state inspector in his state mine inspection,

16

and as well to accompany a company representative, the

17

safety engineer, in periodic tours of the mine.

18

steelworkers union thereafter exercised that right which

19

was provided by the collective bargaining agreement.

20

The

The Supreme Court of Idaho ruled that solely by

21

virtue of having exercised that right, the union assumed

22

the affirmative duty under Idaho tort law to exercise due

23

care in inspecting, and made it clear that what it meant

24

by that was that the union had an obligation to detect any

25

safety hazards that could have or should have been

2

detected in the course of a reasonable inspection.
The issue presented in this Court is whether the

3

Idaho state tort law is preempted by the Federal duty of

4

fair representation which governs the union in the conduct

5

of its functions in administering and enforcing a

6

collective bargaining agreement.

7

We bring to this Court a case that has gone through

8

summary judgment, extensive discovery and a spectrum of

9

undisputed facts.

10

Insofar as the collective bargaining agreement is

11

concerned, that agreement, as I stated, makes clear that

12

the union has these two particular roles in accompanying

13

the state mine and the company inspector.

14

begins by referring to the fact that the company will

15

continue to assume its responsibility to provide a safe

16

and healthful work place.

17

provide the union the limited role that I have just

18

described.

19

has a right on its own to inspect the mine, and the

20

contract does not provide that the union shall be entitled

21

to correct any defects or deficiencies that might be

22

noticed during the course of either of these types of

23

inspections.

24
25

The contract

The company then agrees to

The contract does not provide that the union

Indeed, the limited nature of the union's role is
reflected in part by the fact that the union, under

1

Federal law, did not have the right to even accompany a

2

Federal inspector during the Federal inspections of the

3

mine, and the company would not permit the union to do so.
QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Cohen, if the provisions of

5

the collective bargaining agreement are clear, although

6

they give the union very little authority, and perhaps the

7

Supreme Court of Idaho has piled on a lot of

8

responsibility commensurate with that authority, I don't

9

know that that goes to the preemption question.

The

10

preemption question, I thought, was whether the Court

11

would have to interpret the collective bargaining

12

agreement.

13

MR. COHEN:

14

of the preemption issue.

15

interpretation, but there is a more threshold proposition,

16

Mr. Chief Justice.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well, with two — there is two aspects
One would be the question of

So you don't rely on the interpretation

aspect?
MR. COHEN:

Well, parenthetically, as we have

20

argued in our brief, there is no question but that before

21

the question of whether or not the union assumed any duty,

22

because before the union — unless and until the union

23

assumes a duty, there can be no tort liability.

24

question of whether or not there is any assumption of a

25

duty would have to turn on an interpretation of the

The

1

collective bargaining agreement.

2

question of whether a tort was committed under state law.

3

We have a threshold proposition.

4

proposition —

5

QUESTION:

That would go to the

The threshold

Well, but you — I still don't think you

6

have answered my question.

7

the preemption doctrine, as you describe it, which says

8

you cannot as a state court interpret a collective

9

bargaining agreement?

10

MR. COHEN:

No.

Do you rely on that part of

The more precise formulation, Mr.

11

Chief Justice, would be that when you are interpreting it

12

you must apply Federal law, whether you are a state court

13

or a Federal court.

14

supplemental position that under no circumstance could

15

there ever have been a duty found to exist here on the

16

union to inspect.

17

Yes, we do rely on that in our

But the — but the basic premise and the focus of

18

our position is that effort by the State of Idaho to

19

impose a tort law obligation on the union, arising out of

20

the, quote, "inspection," that effort, that attempt to

21

regulate the union's conduct is preempted by the most

22

fundamental principle of Federal preemption, namely that

23

when the union's conduct — and there is no dispute about

24

this, Mr. Chief Justice — however the, anyone wants to

25

frame the actual conduct, the union was engaged in that

conduct exclusively because it was the collective

2

bargaining agent.

3

collective bargaining agreement to permit it to do the

4

accompanying, and it was actually exercising that right to

5

accompany the inspector.
QUESTION:

6
7

Here we were, then —

Now, what — what of our cases supports

this, what you are, is apparently your primary position?
MR. COHEN:

8
9

It had obtained a provision in the

Well, the case that supports our

primary position is Vaca v. Sipes, for the basic

10

proposition that insofar as the representational function

11

of processing of grievance and administering the grievance

12

arbitration proceeding is concerned, there is a Federal

13

duty.

14

the competing interests, carefully delimitated what that

15

Federal duty would be, and that Federal duty occupies the

16

field.

17

this is —

18

The Federal duty was designed to accommodate all

It is the exclusive duty, insofar as, and I think

QUESTION:

Certainly Vaca doesn't say it is the

19

exclusive duty, does it?

20

MR. COHEN:

Yes it does.

Vaca says insofar as the

21

union is administering the contract through the grievance

22

arbitration proceeding, Federal law governs.

23

square holding of Vaca was the Missouri Supreme Court's

24

attempt to apply Missouri law to impose a duty on the

25

union different from the Federal duty of fair

And the

1

representation could not stand, and in fact was held not

2

to be applicable.

3

QUESTION:

Suppose, Mr. Cohen, the contract here

4

expressly put a — placed a duty on the union, namely that

5

the union did promise to inspect the mine.

6

the same position that, that although there — I suppose

7

there would be a 301 action against the union?

8

it also owe a duty of fair representation to carry out

9

that duty correctly?

10

MR. COHEN:

You would take

But does

I think I would respond as follows,

11

Justice White.

12

recognized in I.B.E.W. v. Hechler, theoretically the union

13

could assume by contract duties in excess of what the

14

traditional kind of representational service is.

15

at least theoretically possible.

16

Theoretically, as this Court in fact

That is

I think the Court would understand and appreciate

17

that is a very unlikely circumstance, given the reality of

18

collective bargaining, the union acting for and on behalf

19

of people in that unit, exacting promises and commitments

20

from the employer.

21

circumstance to believe that in that process of collective

22

bargaining, the consequence would be that the union would

23

assume a duty which was then enforceable by members of the

24

bargaining unit.

25

It would be a very unusual

However, even were that to take place, we would

1

have to look at that collective bargaining agreement,

2

interpret it to see is this that very unusual circumstance

3

where employer permitted a union to assume that kind of

4

authority, and in fact, the union actually assumed it.

5
6

Your question, as I understood it, was

QUESTION:

Suppose the union undertakes, in the

collective bargaining agreement, to inspect the mine?
MR. COHEN:

11

12

MR. COHEN:
in that --

9
10

Well, what about, what about my question

now?

7
8

QUESTION:

That would not, obviously, be this

case.
QUESTION:

13

Because that is what this case is.

The

14

state court, as I understand it, construed this contract

15

as the union undertaking a duty to inspect.

16

MR. COHEN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. COHEN:

20

QUESTION:

22

23

So, let's assume that is right.

Then

what about — what about preemption?

19

21

The state —

All right, now —
What would be your primary position

then?
MR. COHEN:

Our position would basically be this

Court has not addressed that problem.

But it would be —

24

it would be — there are circumstances and factors and

25

considerations at work in that kind of a situation that

2

are not at work here.
QUESTION:

Because let me say —

Well, why not?

Why not?

Didn't the —

3
4

MR. COHEN:

Because the argument would be, Mr.,

5

Justice White, the argument would be, in that kind of a

6

situation the union arguably is displacing the managerial

7

function of inspecting, and the union then would be

8

assuming what would traditionally be an employer role.

9

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the Idaho Supreme

10

Court interpreted the collective bargaining contract to

11

put a duty on the union —

12

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

14

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

16

MR. COHEN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. COHEN:

19

QUESTION:

Suppose we accept that?

20

QUESTION:

You need to wait until Justice White

21
22

Absolutely.
— to inspect?
Absolutely.
Well —
But we — but in fact -Now, suppose we accept that?
But, in fact —

finishes with his question before you begin your response.
QUESTION:

Suppose — suppose — suppose he — we

23

accept that construction of the contract?

24

your primary position?

25

MR. COHEN:

Then what is

Accepting the construction of the

contract as the findings were made here was that all the
union did was accompany.

If we accept it — there is no

disputed fact as to what the union's conduct was, Justice
White.

It was accompany.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

In fact, the state —

You're just not answering my question.
— the state court characterized it as

doing more.
QUESTION:

Well, so, if we, suppose we agree with

them.
MR. COHEN:

If we did more, if we did more our

position would be as long as the union was basically
performing a representational function, and what they were
trying to do was influencing the way the employer carried
out its safety and health responsibility, that would
continue to be preempted.
QUESTION:

We do recognize, however —■

It would be preempted because of the

duty of fair representation?
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes.
Not because it's — it would be a 301

action?
MR. COHEN:

It would — it would be preempted

because it was essentially a duty of fair representation
case.

But I am not denying that there is a possibility

that a provision could be agreed to that somehow would
create some kind of an additional 301 claim that might be

1

enforceable.
QUESTION:

2

3

Well, that is your fallback position,

isn't it?
MR. COHEN:

4

Well, yes.

It's a fallback in this

5

sense.

This Court, earlier this term in the Breininger

6

case, where what was involved was a hiring hall, and the

7

union said after all what we are really doing is taking

8

over a managerial function, this Court said well, the

9

reality is you are administering a safety — a provision

10

of a collective bargaining agreement.

11

are doing that, the Federal duty of fair representation

12

governs your conduct, and you must conduct yourself

13

consistent with that Federal duty.

14

And insofar as you

Now, the — as I said, the Vaca case directly

15

addressed the question where there was one particular type

16

of representational activity involved, one particular

17

activity, namely, the grievance process.

18

analysis of the Federal law is that that same approach is

19

equally applicable, as long as you have an exclusive

20

bargaining agent functioning, administering or enforcing a

21

provision of a collective bargaining agreement.

22

the nature of the conduct that was being sought to be

23

regulated here.

24
25

The, our

No matter how you want to characterize the
plaintiffs' theory, the complaint alleged at the

That is

1

beginning, the union undertook to act as an accident

2

prevention representative and to enforce the safety and

3

health articles of the collective bargaining agreement,

4

and the union performed that service negligently.

5

was the focus in which this case proceeded.

6

continued to proceed as the basic thrust of the

7

plaintiffs.

8

That

It has

Our position is that insofar as that aspect of the

9

union's conduct is concerned, the union has a duty.

10

when this Court and the basic national labor policy

11

reviewed the question of how do you accommodate the

12

interests of individual employees, their bargaining

13

representative, and the company, when you have that kind

14

of conduct taking place.

15

Now,

And the line that was drawn, the effort to

16

accommodate all those competing interests, which comes

17

right out of the core of the National Labor Relations Act

18

when a union is conducting its activities, was to say on

19

the one hand the union is going to be the exclusive

20

representative, the representative of everyone in that

21

unit.

22

to accommodate the interests of individual employees

23

against such abuses.

24
25

But with that extraordinary grant of power we have

And the balance that was struck was designed to
assure on the one hand employees' rights would be

1

protected, but on the other hand the union would be left

2

in a position that it could be a viable collective

3

bargaining representative and serve the interests of

4

everyone in the bargaining unit.

5

And out of that combination of interests and

6

concerns came the Federal duty of fair representation, a

7

duty which says the union must act fairly to all the

8

people in the unit, that it must exercise its discretion

9

in complete good faith and with honesty of purpose and

10

that it cannot engage in any hostility or discrimination

11

against anyone or treat anyone arbitrarily.

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. COHEN;

14

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Cohen.
Yes.
Is it your position, then, that there is

15

a Federal common law of torts against the union for any -

16

- any negligence in its assumed exercise of bargaining

17

activities?

18

MR. COHEN:

Justice Scalia, I wouldn't say it is a

19

Federal common — Federal common law of torts.

20

say that by virtue of having this authority and

21

responsibility, that principle, that Federal law principle

22

governs the manner in which the union conducts itself,

23

incidentally a principle in which negligence has no role.

24
25

QUESTION:

We would

You, you would say that this Court, that

this suit could have been brought in Federal court, then,

SUITE 400

1

on a Federal theory that the union, through its actions,

2

assumed the obligation to inspect, and its — its breach

3

of that assumption gives rise to a Federal cause of

4

action?
MR. COHEN:

5

We would say that there is a Federal

6

claim for the breach of the duty of fair representation.

7

That there always is when a union is conducting itself and

8

administering and enforcing a provision of a collective

9

bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

10

No, no, no.

This hasn't -- this is not

11

— it has nothing to do with a collective —• let's assume

12

there was nothing in the collective bargaining agreement

13

at all about accompanying mine inspectors or anything

14

else.

15

of going around with the, with the mine inspectors, and

16

indeed — just what the state court said here.

17

But, in point of fact, the union got into the habit

MR. COHEN:

I am sure you can appreciate, Justice

18

Scalia, that the union, I know of no instance where a

19

company would have allowed a union —

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Well, I know that, but this -- it

happens —
MR. COHEN:

— to engage in that.

But were that to

23

be the case, the union still is functioning as the

24

exclusive bargaining representative.

25

QUESTION:

And — and there would be a Federal
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

cause of action.
MR. COHEN:

2

And the Federal -- it would be a

3

Federal cause of action, but that would be the only cause

4

of action for that kind of conduct, because what the union

5

is trying to do in that circumstance is to influence the

6

manner in which the employer is providing, is satisfying

7

its relationship to that union.

8

there was a collective bargaining agreement, obviously

9

that would be the union's purpose, to try to monitor the

Now, in most cases if

10

way the employer was living up to its commitments, and

11

certainly to be in a position to try to influence the

12

employer in the manner in which the employer was carrying

13

out its responsibilities.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, take Justice Scalia's

15

hypothetical a step further, if you will.

Supposing that

16

the union officers — you don't need to look at the clock.

17

Suppose that the union officers were on their way to

18

inspect the mine in a union-owned car ran over someone

19

negligently.

20

plaintiff in that case, the injured person, could sue in

21

the Idaho state courts?

22

MR. COHEN:

Now, would there be any question what the

Absolutely could sue via common law

23

action.

It could, the duty of fair representation would

24

play no role in that kind of a circumstance.

25

precisely because the duty of fair representation would

(800) FOR DEPO

And

1

place no role, we aren't in a unique circumstance —

2

QUESTION:

So, so if we were to conclude that the

3

duty of fair representation really played no part in

4

Justice Scalia's hypothetical, then that would mean that

5

that -- this -- that action too would be — could be

6

brought in state court?

7

MR. COHEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, but I want to —
Your position is contrary, I realize

that.
MR. COHEN:

Our position is you have to look to the

11

nature of the conduct in question.

12

how the local union preserves its personal property.

13

Those are areas where we have acknowledged in our brief -

14

- indeed I don't think it's acknowledgement —■ are

15

completely outside the parameters of the operation of the

16

Federal duty of fair representation.

17

obligations that any other citizen would owe are owed by

18

the union.

19

Driving an automobile,

All common law

But in a sense, Chief Justice, that highlights the

20

contrast from the actual situation presented here, because

21

here we're in that very unique area where the union is

22

functioning as the exclusive agent, as the administrator

23

of the safety and health provision, and as the

24

representative of everyone in that mine, designed to

25

influence the way in which the employer is conducting its

still is the functioning of the union in its traditional

3

representative status that is at work there.

4

I recognize there could be competing considerations

5

in that regard, but there are no competing considerations

6

here, as we say, because there is no dispute that — the

7

only reason the union was functioning here was because it

8

had obtained a provision in the agreement which gave it

9

the limited right that it had to accompany the inspector.
QUESTION:

10

In my situation, my hypothetical, I want

11

you to stipulate that the union was negligent in what they

12

did.

13

Would there be a Federal cause of action?
MR. COHEN:

Well, insofar as a Federal cause of

14

action is concerned, mere negligence or bad judgment does

15

not on the merits make out a claim for a breach of the

16

duty of fair representation.

17

that, and the reason is the policy concern that you want

18

to give the union a wide range of reasonableness when it

19

is conducting its activities and having to make the

20

judgment that it has to make as the bargaining

21

representative.

What kind of collective bargaining protections are we

going to try to achieve in the contract.

MR. COHEN:

In the case that we are concerned with,

in essence what that court has said is merely by

there is nothing to suggest we would ever achieve from

state of this record that they wouldn't even allow us to

that its only duty is that of fair representation, which

does not — never raises to the level of due care.

10

In this particular case it's odd that the union

The union has taken the position here

It

11

should say that it has only a duty of fair representation

12

because, first, in order to have a duty of fair

agreement.

working within the confines of duty -- duties that were

actually undertaken underground.

Our position is that they were not.

They were

And therefore their duty is one of due care.

that can't be described by the duty of fair

representation, which only reflects upon their traditional

One of the aspects of this case with

14

regard to the duty of fair representation that is

15

interesting with regard to the union's position at any

rate is that there are a number of developing areas where

17

unions are now starting to engage in traditional roles

18

which had heretofore been strictly the roles of employers.

19

Unions are starting to own businesses, to direct

20

businesses, to manage businesses, as well as being unions.

21

There has to be a line someplace between where this duty

22

of fair representation stops and the duty of due care that

may be owed by these other roles which the union is

engaging in begins.

is drawn in part by this state law.

That state law here

2

indicates that where the union engages in an activity,

3

where it actually undertakes an activity owed by another,

in this case by the employer, it is now taking on a

partial role of the employer, it must live up to that duty

of care which the employer would owe.

we have a duty which would normally be owed by an

the employer can shift it to the union, the union does not

and that is to avoid discriminatory or arbitrary conduct.
