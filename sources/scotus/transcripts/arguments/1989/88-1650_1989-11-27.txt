ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. NORMAN GOLDBERGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue presented in this case is whether the

13

private civil treble damage remedy provided by Congress in

14

the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act

15

known as RICO and codified at 18 U.S.C. Section 1964(c) is

16

within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.

17

We contend that Section 1964(c) is within the exclusive

18

jurisdiction of the federal courts.

19

This Court in the Gulf Offshore case set forth

20

the test that it had applied in determining whether any

21

given congressional enactment is within the exclusive

22

jurisdiction of the federal courts.

23

Analysis must always begin with the presumption

24

that jurisdiction is concurrent.

*\

1

federal courts, and with respect with each congressional

2

enactment the question is whether Congress intended to

3

exercise that power.

4

This Court in Gulf Offshore set forth three

5

methods by which the congressional intent to confer

6

exclusive jurisdiction could be discerned.

7

V_

First, that congressional intent could be

8

discerned by an explicit statutory directive that

9

jurisdiction be exclusive.

Second, the congressional

10

intent to confer exclusive jurisdiction could be discerned

11

by an unmistakable implication from legislative history.

12

Third, the congressional intent to confer exclusive

13

jurisdiction could be discerned by an incompatibility

14

between federal interests and the exercise of state court

15

jurisdiction.

\

16

Mr. Goldberger, do you think there is

17

any difference between the standards laid down in Gulf

18

Offshore and the traditional standards of the Claflin

19

case?

20

s

QUESTION:

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Your Honor, I do not think so.

21

There was in Claflin a holding that exclusive jurisdiction

22

could be determined either explicitly or implicitly, and

23

also a reference to incompatibility in Claflin.

24

Gulf Offshore and Claflin, therefore, are entirely

25

compatible.

I think

With respect to Section 1964(c) there is no

1
2

explicit statutory directive that jurisdiction be

3

exclusive.

4

that arises from the legislative history of Section

5

1964(c) as well as exclusive jurisdiction can also be seen

because of an incompatibility between the exercise —

There is, however, an unmistakable implication

QUESTION:

7

Well, where do you find in the

8

legislative history that Congress even considered the

9

question?

Your Honor, there is no

11

explicit legislative discussion of the question of

12

exclusive jurisdiction.

13

reliance on Section 4 of the Clayton Act in drafting

14

Section 1964(c) of RICO.

There is, however, a clear

✓
15

QUESTION:

Yeah, but that falls far short of any

16

kind of indication by Congress that they didn't expect the

17

normal presumption of concurrent jurisdiction to apply.

18

MR. GOLDBERGER:

19

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

It looks to me like you're just left

20

with your argument on incompatibility and I'm not sure it

21

is.

22

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Your Honor, I think under this

this Court was on the right track under the Clayton Act.

7

Why would we want to extend it to a new statute?

8
9

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I think, Your Honor, whether

this Court was on the right track with respect to Clayton

10

may be in some sense beside the point because it is what

11

Congress knew this Court had done when it enacted Section

12

1964(c).

13

decisions in Freeman v. Bee Machine Company and in General

14

Investment that jurisdiction was exclusive.

15

That is, Congress was aware of the Court's

Thereby, when it enacted Section 1964(c) it was

16

presumably adopting those decisions as well, for it made

17

no change in the statutory language between the Clayton

18

Act and Section 1964(c).

19

Moreover, this Court has previously recognized

20

these two similarities between Section 1964(c) and Section

21

4 in interpreting Section 1964(c).

22

decision, this Court was confronted with the question of

23

whether there was a requirement that there be a prior

24

predicate act conviction before a successful 64 — 1964(c)

25

action could be brought.

Thus, in the Sedima

In part relying on the history of the Clayton

1

Act and this Court's interpretations of the Clayton Act,

3

the Court concluded that it was — such a predicate act

4

conviction was unnecessary.
The Court made similar references to Section 4

of the Clayton Act and Section 1964(c) in trying to adopt

7

the proper statute of limitations in the Malley-Duff

8

decision.

9

arbitrable, this Court also made reference to Section 4 of

And also, in deciding whether RICO claims were

10

the Clayton Act and noted the similarity in purpose and

11

structure between Section 4 of the Clayton Act and Section

12

1964(c) .

13

This congressional intent to model Section

14

1964(c) on Section 4 of the Clayton Act does give rise to

15

an implication that Congress intended Section 1964(c) to

16

be interpreted in the same way as Section 4 of the Clayton

17

Act and to provide for exclusive jurisdiction.

18

This congressional intent that Section 1964(c)

19

be interpreted in the same way is buttressed by an

20

examination of RICO'S underlying policies and structures

21

which are incompatible with any exercise of state court

22

jurisdiction.

23

To begin with, many of the predicate acts which

24

form the heart of any Section 1964(c) claim, the pattern

25

of racketeering activity, are federal crimes.

Congress in

1

18 U.S.C. Section 3231 has provided that jurisdiction over

2

federal offenses shall be exclusively federal.

3

At least one of the purposes of Section 3231 has

4

been to enable there to be an orderly development of the

5

federal criminal laws and to provide for the development

6

of expertise with respect to those federal criminal laws.

7

If jurisdiction is held to be concurrent, in

8

every RICO case in which there is an allegation of a

9

federal predicate offense the state courts will

10

necessarily have to become involved in the interpretation

11

of these federal criminal offenses.

12

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that state

13

courts are called upon to interpret federal law in every

14

situation in which there is concurrent jurisdiction.

15

don't see why this is any different.

16

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I

Your Honor, it's because of the

17

18

19

offenses to the federal courts exclusively.

There is not

And therefore, Congress has expressed its intent
as to how federal criminal offenses are to be treated.
QUESTION:

federal interpretation as they employ suits under RICO it

rises to the level of any serious incompatibility.
MR. GOLDBERGER:

Your Honor, if you take as a

given that Section 3231 has as its purpose the development
of expertise and the development of — the orderly
development of the federal criminal laws, there is an
incompatibility.

It arises because there will be over

time the accretion of state court precedent with respect
to federal criminal offenses, which today does not exist.
The predictability of the federal criminal laws
will, as a result, necessarily be undercut, and the
congressional purpose in enacting Section 3231 will also
be undercut.
QUESTION:

Do you think the state courts would

just go off on their own in interpreting federal criminal
laws?

Just like federal courts construing questions of

state law tend to follow state law, I would think the
state courts would tend to follow federal court decisions
in the area of federal criminal law.
MR. GOLDBERGER:

Your Honor, they mayor may not

follow federal court decisions<

They certainly will

follow the decisions of this Court, bound as they are by
the supremacy clause.

But they may not necessarily

follow, and they are under no obligation to follow, the
decisions of the federal circuits or the federal district
courts.

12

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Your Honor, it may be that it

13

was fowled up under uniform federal jurisdiction, but I

14

suggest that it may become even more fouled up, to use

15

your terms, if the state courts in all 50 jurisdictions

16

are permitted to issue opinions on the federal criminal

17

laws which they would necessarily have to do in the

18

context of ruling on motions for summary judgment, in the

19

context of jury instructions, and even in the context of

20

discovery motions as they discuss the relevancy of various

21

22

In addition to the incompatibility which is

provided by the use of the federal criminal laws in the

1

This Court has noted in Sedima and the recent

2

H.J. decision that RICO was deliberately crafted by

3

Congress as a broad statute so as to catch within its

4

parameters all types of repetitive criminal conduct which

5

was invasive of the business community.

6

Necessarily the terms used by Congress were

7

somewhat vague and broad when the statute was drafted.

8

a result, the various terms in RICO, such as enterprise

9

and pattern, have received what this Court called in H.J.

10

a plethora of opinions and the concurrence called a

11

kaleidoscope of views.

12

As

If the state courts are permitted to exercise

13

jurisdiction over RICO, civil RICO actions, this plethora

14

of opinions over many of the issues still remaining under

15

RICO and even under the pattern issue, which this Court

16

has now left to basically a case-by-case analysis, will

17

increase and the natural synergy of the federal system is

18

not available to harmonize the various outstanding issues

19

and the opinions which may issue with respect to these

20

various outstanding issues.

21

QUESTION:

I think what you're saying is that if

22

there is any statute that can't suffer from leaving it to

state courts it's RICO.

Thus, Section 1965(b)

And by their terms,

As a result, the Congress in enacting RICO

14

recognized that the patterns of criminal conduct which it

15

sought to reach out and attack were in many instances

multi-state and nationwide in scope.

17

provided plaintiffs with nationwide procedural devices to

18

attack this nationwide problem.

At least one of the purposes of Section 1964(c)

20

was to create plaintiffs who would become private to the

RICO, namely the invasiveness of organized criminal

1

First and foremost, quite in contrast to RICO,

2

there is an indication in the legislative history that

3

Congress thought about the issue and at least some

4

indication that it was Congress' intent to delegate

5

exclusively to federal courts the responsibility for

6

interpreting the antitrust laws.

7

Secondly, I think the Court's decision in the

8

Clayton Act cases is probably best explained by the

9

remarkably open-ended texture of the Clayton Act and the

10

antitrust laws and the historical context in what that

11

issue came before the court.

12

After all, that — that open texture of a law

13

for the first time criminalizing legitimate business

14

conduct called out to the courts to really develop a

15

federal common law regulating business conduct that —

16

that the Court may well have recognized to have a

17

pervasive effect on interstate commerce.

18

So, I think both because of — of the

19

legislative history and because of the historical —

20

context of the Clayton Acts, I think that the Court may

21

have approached it differently than — than we're dealing

22

here with today under RICO.

It is particularly noteworthy in this regard

4

that each of the state high courts that has considered the

issue has ruled that its courts are competent and

appropriate tribunals to adjudicate federal RICO claims.

7

Finally, and most significantly, RICO'S remedial

purposes will be promoted by giving victims of organized

crime a choice of forums in which to assert their claims

It has been conceded that RICO'S legislative

Whereas here — whereas here it is clear that

Congress never even considered the issue of whether to

5

such modeling, we submit, cannot meet this Court's

6

unmistakable implication test.

7

Moreover, in the case of RICO this modeling is a

8

particularly weak analogy because, as this Court has

9

recognized, the legislative history of RICO shows that

10

Congress did not intend by adopting the treble damage

11

remedy to bring with it all of the -- of the baggage

This Court has never found an implication in

legislative history sufficient to rebut the strong

19

presumption of concurrent jurisdiction.

2

of providing exclusive federal jurisdiction over claims

3

under that Act.

4

The Court dismissed that evidence of legislative

5

intent as insufficient to constitute an unmistakable

6

implication of an intent to strip the state courts of

7

their jurisdiction.

8

9

Even more instructive is the Court's
determination that Section 1983 claims are subject to

10

concurrent jurisdiction.

11

Section 1983 makes unmistakably clear that Congress'

12

predominant concern was creating a federal forum for the

13

vindication of federal rights against state officials.

subject to concurrent, not exclusive, jurisdiction.

Turning to the disabling incompatibility test,

here we have no inconsistency, much less any

19

incompatibility, between RICO's — RICO'S purposes and the

20

state court adjudication of civil damage claims.

provisions was to provide a remedy for innocent parties

This Court has consistently found that

2

permitting the state courts to entertain federal causes of

3

action facilitates the enforcement of federal rights.

4

Here, recognizing state court jurisdiction over RICO

5

claims will allow persons victimized by organized crime to

6

pursue their claims in the first instance in forums which

7

they may find more convenient or less expensive.
Certainly there is nothing inconsistent with

RICO's remedial aims in providing plaintiffs this choice.

10

Indeed, it is the closing not the opening of state courts

that would undermine RICO's purposes.

With respect to the inappropriateness of — that

— the Petitioners allege of the state court's

6

interpreting federal criminal laws, the concern, as I

7

understand it today, is that somehow the state courts may

8

create bad precedent by misinterpreting the federal

9

criminal laws.
In the first instance, as has been pointed out,

10
11

the state courts are obliged to follow the precedence of

12

this Court in interpreting the federal criminal laws.
There is nothing, moreover, in our

13
14

constitutional scheme that prohibits the state courts from

adjudicating federal criminal cases.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. NORMAN GOLDBERGER

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

*

16

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Just briefly.

First,

17

respondents place reliance on the Section 1983 cases which

18

hold that jurisdiction is concurrent under that act and on

19

the Dowd Box decision.

20

distinguishable.

21

Both of those cases are

In the case of Section 1983 this Court in Patsy

22

v. Board of Regents and Felder v. Casey engaged in an

23

extensive analysis which demonstrated that Congress in

24

enacting Section 1983 in fact had an affirmative intent to

25

retain concurrent jurisdiction over Section 1983 claims.

The same is true with — respect to the Dowd Box

1
2

decision.

The court there engaged in analysis of Section

3

301 and determined that Congress in enacting that section

4

intended to expand, not to contract, the four that were

5

available for Section 301 actions.

6

In addition, the Respondents indicate that there

7

is Congressional history which shows that Congress did not

8

intend to adapt all of the baggage of the Clayton. Act to

9

Section 1964(c) actions.

10

There is some legislative history that supports

11

that, but as Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent

12

in the Sedima case and as other courts have pointed out as

13

well, there is a limitation in that legislative history

14

which indicates that what Congress was concerned about was

15

importing into Section 1964(c) concepts of antitrust

16

standing and antitrust injury.

17

There is no indication that Congress was

18

concerned in any way of limiting this Court's holding in

Clayton Act decisions were not —

4

QUESTION:

Were not correct.

5

MR. GOLDBERGER:

— the best-decided decisions.

6

But I think the point here, to reiterate, is not whether

7

the Clayton Act decisions were the best-decided decisions,

8

but rather than Congress in enacting Section 1964(c) was

9

aware of those decisions and made no change in applicable

10

language when it enacted Section 1964(c).
Finally, I would just like to address the

11
12

contention that RICO actions — there's nothing anomalous

13

about state court judges interpreting federal law since

14

federal court judges will be interpreting state law into

15

RICO actions, which is, I understand, the arguments the

16

Respondents have made.

17

Congress made a choice when it enacted RICO.

It

18

made a choice to in fact federalize some state criminal

19

laws.

20

judges would in fact be interpreting state criminal laws.

21

It did not anticipate that federal laws would be

22

interpreted in the state — federal criminal laws would be

23

interpreted in the state courts and that somehow Section

24

3231 would be changed by the enactment of Section 1964(c).
