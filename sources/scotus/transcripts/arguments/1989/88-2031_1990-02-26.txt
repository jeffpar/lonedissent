ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROBERTS:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the United

11

States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

12

panel of that court held that the Postal Service

13

regulation prohibiting solicitation on postal premises, in

14

effect in its current form since 1978, was

15

unconstitutional.

16

from the Third, Seventh, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits.

17

is wrong and should be reversed.

A divided

This decision was contrary to decisions
It

On August 6, 1986, the respondents set up a

19

table five to six feet from the entrance to the Bowie Post

Office on the concrete apron that surrounds the post

office building and runs between the building and the post

22

office parking lot.

Yes, Your Honor.

Would it permit handing out a leaflet

MR. ROBERTS:

The Postal Service has construed

the regulation to allow that.

What is prohibited is --

Is what?
— speech or conduct that solicits

an immediate donation of charity on the premises.

QUESTION:

A collection on the spot.

MR. ROBERTS:

20

The reason that that type of activity is

On the spot.

21

prohibited while the other examples that you mentioned are

22

not is that in the Post — Postal Service's experience it

23

was that direct solicitation, seeking an immediate act of

24

charity on the spot, that led to the problems it

25

experienced.

Do you think it's more bothersome

than the leafletting?

I mean, is that demonstrable?

MR. ROBERTS:

case.

on postal property, if you look ahead and you see someone

12

carrying a picket sign, you know that when you get there

13

you can read the sign if you wish, react to it if you wish

14

or just keep walking.

passerby in an immediate face-to-face confrontation that

19

found, inherently more aggressive than leafletting or

20

picketing or discussion, and it was that type of conduct

21

that the Postal Service found created congestion, impeding

22

patrons in their transaction of postal business, and

23

distracted postmasters and clerks from their duties.

24
25

That type of conduct is, as the Postal Service

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, what about asking a

passerby to sign a petition?

MR. ROBERTS:

1

That is not prohibited.

The

2

regulations prohibit campaigning for public office; but,

3

assuming that's not the sort of petition we're talking

4

about, that's not prohibited.
Now, I will agree that that type of conduct has

5
6

many of the same burdens associated with soliciting

7

charity, but, in fact, the Postal Service had not found'

8

any problem with that sort of activity on postal premises.

9

There are people who want to leaflet on postal premises,

10

who want to picket and who want to seek signatures for

11

petitions.

12

crowds come out and that the problems are experienced.

13

It's when you let them ask for money that the

So in 1978 the Postal Service narrowly targeted

14

that type of expressive activity that was causing the

15

problem and prohibited only that.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ROBERTS:

What were these problems?
The problems were congestion at

18

postal entryways, the distraction of the postmasters and

19

their clerks from their duties.

20

This case is a very good example.

On the day in

21

question, the postmaster and his clerks were compelled to

22

field 40 to 50 complaints from customers concerning

23

respondents' activities.

24
25

QUESTION:

Are these problems that could be

addressed by time, place and manner requirements, by

1

making the location of such a booth or a table more out of

2

the way and prohibiting it on peak — at peak hours or

3

peak days or something of that sort?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

The Service expressly considered

5

that alternative in 1978.

It determined, given the fact

6

that we're talking about more than 35,000 separate

7

facilities around the country with various different

8

architectural configurations and surrounding environments,

9

that it would be an administrative and logistic nightmare

10

to attempt to draw time, place and manner restrictions for

11

each of those 35,000 facilities.

12

It further determined that it would be very

13

difficult, if not impossible, to enforce those sorts of

14

restrictions.

15

forces, and it would be impossible to monitor compliance

16

with the time, place and manner restrictions.

17

Most postal facilities do not have security

Finally, it concluded that such a system, which

18

would leave considerable discretion with local postmasters

19

either in — in implementation or enforcement, was

20

undesirable given the far-flung nature of the commercial

21

enterprise because they were concerned that the

22

postmasters would discriminate on the basis of viewpoint

23

or content.

that if the post offices are permitting petition

be conducted in a very aggressive manner, and very likely

3

the Post Office is willing to have some kind of

4

restrictions or regulations that it's willing to enforce

5

to make sure that patrons aren't subjected to abusive

6

tactics.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, it is true that, as I

8

indicated in response to Justice Stevens' question, that

petition gathering can have many of the same problems as -

10

- as solicitation; but given the Postal Service's

experience, it wasn't creating serious problems.

Could that sort of restriction not be

activity if it fell within the restriction.

further concluded that allowing limited solicitation

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, this is based on a

regulation, isn't it?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Yes, sir.

Is there any significance in not --

that it is a regulation rather than a statute?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think not, Your Honor.

It is a

18

regulation duly issued pursuant to authority given by

19

Congress to the Postal Service, and deference is owed to

20

the Service in its interpretation of the regulation, but I

21

don't think it carries any less weight than would a

22

statute regulating these activities.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You don't cite the — the authority

under which the regulations are issued, do you?
MR. ROBERTS:

I believe we do.

It's the act

1

that transformed the old Post Office Department into the

2

Postal Service in 1970, and when the Postal Service

3

enacted these regulations the objective was to reduce

4

and — and to the extent possible eliminate what they

5

called nonmission-related burdens.

6

The direction from Congress when it passed the

7

Postal Service statute was to run the Post' Office as to'

8

the extent possible like a business, and so it began

9

looking at what was permitted and started to eliminate the

10

nonmission-related duties that were distracting it from

11

its really quite awesome commercial endeavor.

If we decide this case, does it apply to Bowie,

period?
MR. ROBERTSi

3

Well, the Bowie Post Office

facility is the pattern that's used by the Service in

5

suburban settings.

6

facilities nationwide, so it's difficult to generalize.

7

This is a very common pattern.

that you're set well back from the traditional forum city

Have we ever

1

access, or have we only applied that where what is sought

2

is some sort of access to the facility?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Your Honor, the Court has applied

4

forum access to areas in which the public was given

5

general access.

6

It involved Fort Dix in New Jersey, but the streets and

7

the sidewalks were open to the public.

8

9

most recently mentioned that the fact that the public is

Greer, I suppose, is the clearest case.

And the Court in

10

given a right of general access does not transform the

11

property into a public forum.

12

QUESTION:

Do you think it's a satisfactory sort

13

of analysis?

Is it working out satisfactorily from a

14

legal standpoint, in your view?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

There's been a lot of criticism of

17

it, and there certainly is -- are suggestions in some of

18

the briefs in this case that we should get off that tack

19

and onto something else in these cases.

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The — the

21

amici, all of whom have an interest in using the

22

government's property for their own purposes, don't like

23

the idea that is at the base of forum analysis that the

24

government, like a private owner of property, has the

25

right to reserve its property for the purposes to which it

is lawfully dedicated.

2

and I think that has been working out quite well.

3

That's the core of forum analysis,

The suggestion that the analysis should be — be

4

junked and replaced with sort of a general "why not"

5

approach, why can't we do this, shifts the burden

completely.

landmark Adderley decision that the government has rights

8

with respect to its property and shifts the burden to the

government to justify why it's imposing a restriction.

10

It -- it takes away the notion underlying the

The government restricts the access to the

11

extent in the activities involved once you have access

12

here because this property is dedicated to the Postal

13

Service's use, not as a forum for expressive activity.

Now if, in fact, this -—

QUESTION:

Do you — do you think the

government's position would be the same or would have been

the same had this been a Red Cross solicitation?

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Do you think there would have been 50

complaints if it were the Red Cross?
MR. ROBERTS:

5

I -- I can't say that there would

be.

7

of the complaints were probably based on exactly what it

8

was the respondents were saying, but there's no indication

9

that any of them in fact were based on that.

10

Probably — probably not.

I readily admit that some

In fact, the one complaint we know about, the

11

woman said she thought it wasn't fair because they don't

12

let them sell Girl Scout cookies there, which indicates at

13

least in Bowie that the solicitation ban is being enforced

14

without regard — without regard to content".

15

It is, in fact, Your Honor, the problem that you

16

allude to that perhaps they would bend the rules for the

17

sort of organizations that are more popular, that was one

18

of the reasons the Service didn't want to allow limited

19

solicitation, because they thought they couldn't police

20

that effectively throughout the nation.

21

they adopted the general ban.

22

QUESTION:

That's one reason

Well, let's — let's assume

23

that — that the Service, the Postal Service would have

authority to forbid all of this kind of communications

that you now permit.

How do you show that?

MR. ROBERTS:

The Postal Service when it adopted

11

this ban on solicitation, it noted in the Federal Register

12

announcement it was expressly allowing these other

13

activities, leafletting and picketing, and it explained

14

what the difference was between solicitation and those

15

other forms of activities.

MR. ROBERTS:

Who thought that — that — that this

was just really just a minor bother for you.
MR. ROBERTS:

8

9

But not — not the two judges in

the majority.

6
7

But not the majority?

Well, their analysis, first of

all, was that this -- the concrete apron, the access

10

walkway, was a public forum, and once they reached that

11

conclusion, of course, that's a much heavier burden for

12

the Postal Service to carry.
I would note that the Seventh Circuit concluded

13
14

that the Service could carry the burden even if this

15

walkway were — this type of walkway were a public forum.

16

The conclusion, though, that it is a public

17

forum is inconsistent with this Court's decisions.

If

18

this type of property were a traditional public forum,

19

one, in Justice Roberts' words, that was immemorially or

20

time out of mind set aside for expressive activities, we

21

would expect at least a few decisions from this Court so

22

holding.

with one arguable exception concerning activities on

24

sidewalks, streets, involved sidewalks or streets on the

perimeter of the government property forming the boundary.

MR. ROBERTS:

It depends on the configuration of

the lobby; and, of course, I suppose that solicitation

would be off to a side away from the lines.

MR. ROBERTS:

that they considered and expressly rejected because they

Time, place and manner restrictions are the

activity and public convenience.

8

9

the Postal Service determined that it would be more

Yet, rather than

10

efficient, if you will, to eliminate a protected form of

11

free speech rather than to regulate it.
There are existing regulations that the Postal

12

13

Service currently has which prohibits obstruction,

14

interference with postal patrons, interference with postal

15

employees in the performance of their duties.

16

What has happened in this particular case is

17

that a classic form of political speech, as Judge

18

Wilkinson referred to it, was eliminated strictly because

19

the government in its discretion said it would be too

20

complicated to regulate it; and it is the elimination of

free speech that these people were convicted for, if you

will.

And in comparing that test and the government

now stating that, well, what we're really talking about in

happened in the district court and may not have been the

Could you and would you argument — argue that

Yes, that is, and that is our

You mean so long as the government

allows the public access to a government building, it has

MR. SEKULOW:

I think that argument could be

made that in fact the public — that a compelling interest

MR. SEKULOW:

Perhaps a booth rule would suffice

inside the post office on a first come, first served

basis.

The experience that the Postal Service had,

10

obviously I'm not trying to argue their point, is that

11

inside the postal facility they were having sufficient

congestion problems where the operation of the forum was

13

being affected.

10

But yet it was classic political speech

The aspect I think that's important to draw the

distinction — and I think the Postal Service really did

this — is that they were concerned with solicitation

13

taking place really inside the lobbies.

14

the experience was a problem.

But that's quite a different argument

MR. SEKULOW:

I -- I wouldn't think so, Justifce

That is, the design

set the area back from the main street mostly because of

11

the concerns with traffic on these main streets, so

12

setting it back allowing parking, a parking lot to be a

13

place between the municipal sidewalk, which the Fourth

Circuit said is not a reasonable alternative means of

communication, and the public access sidewalk.

intervening parking lot does not create -- create a First

MR. SEKULOW:

I think that there are, from what

we understand, two basic designs to post offices, and some

exist immediately adjacent to municipal sidewalks, which,

of course, the government concedes would be protected

Yes, Your Honor.

If we focus on access to the

MR. ROBERTS:

And as the Court articulated in the Cornelius
case, the government doesn't have to wait until havoc is

wreaked to act in restricting access with respect to a

nonpublic forum.

12

I understood my brother to concede that if the

Postal Service eliminated all extraneous activities and

14

barred all sorts of expression, there would be no

constitutional objection.

16

somewhat inconsistent with an argument that this is a

traditional public forum, and I take it to mean that what

18

we're talking about is a limited public forum.

as the Court has made clear, in a limited public forum

selective access does not mean that everyone has the right

to come and go and do whatever activities they wish.
