ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. AUCHINCLOSS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

The issue presented in this case asks whether a

11

shipper who utilizes the services of a motor common

12

carrier has a legal right to the benefit of an unfiled

13

illegal rate, or must the shipper pay the carrier's lawful

14

tariff rate.

15

in this case, was a motor common carrier that conducted

16

operations in interstate commerce pursuant to authority

17

granted by the ICC and under tariffs on file with the ICC.

18

The respondents are a shipper, Primary Steel, who utilized

19

the services of Quinn, and the Interstate Commerce

20

Commission.

Quinn Freight Lines, one of the petitioners

The facts in this case indicate that Primary and

21
22

Quinn negotiated rates for the transportation of steel

23

products from a point in Connecticut to destinations in 12

24

states.

its rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission,

Notwithstanding the fact that Quinn did not file

1

transportation was performed over a period of nearly three

2

years, and roughly 1,100 shipments were transported.

3

Following the bankruptcy of Maislin and Quinn,

4

it was discovered by the rate auditors who were retained

5

by the estate of Maislin that the transportation charges

6

assessed Quinn — assessed Primary by Quinn were in fact

7

not on file in tariffs on file with the ICC.

8
9

Now, the rate auditors made demand for payment
of undercharges, that is the difference between the filed

10

tariff rates and the unfiled rates that were assessed on

11

the carrier's freight bills.

12

undercharges, and an action was instituted in the United

13

States District Court in the District of Missouri, Kansas

14

City specifically.

15

Primary refused to pay the

referred three issues to the Interstate Commerce

Commission for consideration.

18

rates, applicable filed tariff rates that is, were in fact

19

applicable to the shipments transported by Primary, or by

20

Quinn on behalf of Primary; second, whether Quinn's rates

21

were reasonable pursuant to standards established under

22

the Interstate Commerce Act; and third, whether Quinn

23

would be barred from the collection of its undercharges by

24

virtue of two provisions contained in the Interstate

25

Commerce Act:

First, whether Quinn's

1

carrier practices, reasonable rates and so on, and

2

secondly, the so-called Tariff Requirement Act, or

3

provision of the act, which is Section 10761 of the Act.

4

In an advisory decision issued by the Interstate

5

Commerce Commission, the Commission ignored the

6

applicability issue and the rate reasonableness issue, and

7

instead decided that the carrier should be foreclosed from

8

collecting its undercharges, based solely on the language

9

of Section 10701 of the Act, which again is that provision

10

which requires carriers' rates and practices to be

11

reasonable.

12

Following the advisory decision, the district

13

court issued its decision in which it upheld the ICC

14

advisory opinion, noting also that the negotiated rate

15

proposition was an unreasonable practice and in fact

16

foreclosed the carrier from collecting its undercharges.

17

The court also held that there was no provision

18

contained in the Interstate Commerce Act which foreclosed

19

the Commission from issuing a policy statement which in

20

effect said that it would henceforth consider equitable

21

defenses to carriers' efforts to collect lawful tariff

22

charges.

23

On appeal the Eighth Circuit court of appeals

24

affirmed the district court's decision for essentially the

25

same reasons.

1

Now, the contact which gives rise to this case,

2

an agreement between a common carrier and a shipper to do

3

business at a rate other than the lawful filed tariff

4

rate, is explicitly prohibited by the Interstate Commerce

5

Act.

6

court of appeals failed to recognize the extremely narrow

7

relief offered to shippers under the Interstate Commerce

8

Act for the recovery of reparations or undercharges on

9

past motor common carrier shipments.

In upholding the district court's decision, the

10

Congress has created a mechanism, a statutory

11

framework, in fact, under which shippers and motor

12

carriers will conduct their business.

13

framework is the common carrier's tariff.

14

transactions between shippers and motor carriers must be

15

conducted pursuant to explicit tariff provisions.

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

The essence of that

The

What section says that?
That's Section 10761 of the

Act, Your Honor.
Carriers cannot perform a service.

They cannot

21

perform transportation unless there are explicit

22

provisions in the tariff which underlie that service or

23

that transportation.

24

the tariff, of course, are subject to scrutiny, either by

25

the ICC or by other shippers or carriers who would have an

1

interest in what the common carrier's holding out may be.

2

Failure to adhere to the filed tariff can result in civil

3

penalties or criminal penalties.

4

That is why we say in our reply brief in this

5

instance that in fact the unfiled illegal rate is the

6

antithesis of the statutory rate policy promulgated by the

7

Congress.

QUESTION:

Mr. Auchincloss, suppose the railroad

or the trucker had filed the rates like he said he would.

10

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, sir.

It would have applied to everybody,

wouldn't it?

13

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

QUESTION:

15

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

That is correct.

Not just this one transaction.
That is correct.

Those rates

are available for anybody who would utilize the services

of a common carrier.

shippers, and it is intended to avoid discrimination by

20

permitting carriers and shippers to engage in these secret

rate agreements which foreclose from public view

shipper's transportation is performed.

high when it was paid, the shipper could not get any money

2

back, if he paid the filed rate?

3

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

6

QUESTION:

But that is no longer true.
That is correct.

And that was true at the time we

7

decided the T.I.M.E. case.

8

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

9

That is correct.

That is correct.

Well, prior

to T.I.M.E., and T.I.M.E. held that shippers had no

10

recourse for transportation rates that were applicable to

11

past transportation.

12

QUESTION:

But they now do.

13

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

14

QUESTION:

But they now do.

In 1965 —

So — so it really isn't true that -

15

- anymore at least, that the filed rate is the governing

16

rate.

17

governing rate in one direction.

18

What — the most you can say is that it is the

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, it's the governing rate

19

until the Interstate Commerce Commission, upon referral

20

from a district court in the instance of a motor carrier

21

or a motor common carrier, determines that the carrier's

22

rate was either not applicable or was unreasonable.

23

are explicit provisions in the Act now which are the

24

result of the 1965 legislation, which provide a mechanism

25

by which shippers can ask the Commission whether or not a

There

1

carrier's rates applicable to its past shipments were

2

reasonable or not.
QUESTION:

3

But in light of that change in the

4

Act, might it not be reasonable to reconsider whether our

5

decision in the T.I.M.E. case should come out the same

6

way?

7

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, the provisions in the

8

Act which Congress formulated provide shippers with a very

9

narrow remedy for the relief that you suggest, as for

10

relief in a prospective fashion, or whether or not it's an

11

attack upon an existing rate.

12

provisions in the Act which provide specifically how that

13

mechanism should operate to give shippers relief.

14

are provisions that relate specifically to —

investigation and suspension proceedings, complaint

proceedings.

18

reasonable or unreasonable.

QUESTION:

I mean, there are other

But if they are held to be

20

unreasonable in such — on such a referral, everybody who

21

has been charged that rate has some remedy.
MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

22

Is that it?

Everybody who has been charged

23

that rate would certainly have a cause of action.

That is

24

correct.

25

Section 10701(c), I believe it is, of the Act, which

provides specific standards by which the Commission must

2

evaluate the reasonableness of carriers' rates, whether

3

prospective or future application, or whether in the

4

instance of past transportation performed on behalf of a

5

shipper, precisely what rates, or what levels of rates are

6

reasonable for that transportation.

7

QUESTION:

Suppose we hold, as you wish in this

8

case, that the shipper has to pay the tariff rate, even

9

though it is unreasonable.

So the shipper goes ahead and

10

pays it.

Can the shipper then bring a suit for

11

reparations for the excessively high rate that he has been

12
13

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, I don't know whether you

14

are talking in a hypothetical sense, Your Honor, whether

or not —

QUESTION:

Well, no, I'm not talking

hypothetically.

18

do today, that you just require two suits, initially,

19

since the carrier cannot raise the issue, the shipper has

20

to pay the money.

21

raise the issue, so he can —

22

Because if that is the result of what we

But then, of course, the shipper can

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, in that connection I

23

should say that in the Interstate Commerce Commission

24

proceeding evidence was submitted on referral from the

25

district court addressing the reasonableness of the

retained by the Quinn estate, that the rates were within a

10

In fact extensive cost evidence was

So in this particular

case, the shipper has had that determination.

11

QUESTION:

So you would not necessarily say that

12

we would come out the way you want us to come out if this

13

were a case in which it was an unreasonable rate?

14

would not be making the same arguments you are making?

2

there were three issues presented to the district court.

3

So in fact, as I have already indicated,

So do we take this case on the

assumption that the rate was reasonable, but that the

5

decision just rests on whether it was an unreasonable

billing practice?

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

That — that's precisely the

case.

That's how we take the case.

fact, a reference to the record in the case indicates

But you do concede that had the

challenge been to the reasonableness of the rate and had

that been sustained, then that is a valid defense?

19

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Oh, we wouldn't be here today.

I mean, if the Commission had made a determination that

the carrier's rate was not reasonable, there would be no

about that.

In fact, the Commission has primary

QUESTION:

1

What was the basis of the

2

Commission's determination that this was an unreasonable

3

practice?

4

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, the Commission has taken

5

Section 10701(a) of the Act, which requires that carrier

6

rates, classifications, rules and practices be reasonable.

7

It has tied that together with its alleged primary

8

jurisdiction.

9

court of appeals bought it, and on the basis of that

And the district court bought this and the

10

simply say that we can negate the application of a filed

11

rate by virtue of our rate reasonableness and practice

12

reasonableness jurisdiction, and in effect not hold that

13

carrier to collection of its legal charges.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But what was the reasoning of the

ICC?
MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, the reasoning is

17

essentially that, that it has jurisdiction under 10701 to

18

determine whether carrier practices are reasonable.

19

QUESTION:

Yeah, but they based it on the fact

20

that they — there was an agreement.

21

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

22

23

Well, there was an agreement,

but it was never reduced to tariff form.
QUESTION:

All right, there was an agreement,

24

and the shipper paid the lower rate relying on it.

25

the carrier failed to file a new tariff.

QUESTION:

Well, that is correct, but —

And they say that that is an

unreasonable practice then.

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

QUESTION:

6

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

That's what they say.
That's what they say, but —

But what's wrong with that?
Well, this Court has held on

7

at least two occasions, certainly in T.I.M.E. and Montana-

8

Dakota, that rate reasonableness or practice

9

reasonableness is not a justiciable legal right.

It is

10

simply a criterion for application in an administrative

proceeding to determine a lawful rate.

Well, you have to look at the framework, again,

of the Interstate Commerce Act.

5

The Commission says the carrier engaged in an unreasonable

the shipper's entitled to this relief.

Congress has made no such provision.

1

In this case is there evidence that

the parties purported to be negotiating a new tariff?

was it just an agreement to discount off the existing

5

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Suppose it were clear from the course

of dealing that the parties purported to be agreeing on a

new tariff that the carrier would then file, and then the

carrier just neglects to file?

16

MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Well, that situation could

arise, quite obviously, and it didn't in this situation.

But in instances in which the carrier alleges he is going

to file his tariff and he doesn't, and it is later

discovered that this situation has developed, the carrier,

MR. MERRILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

case are typical of hundreds of proceedings which are now

12

pending in the lower courts involving insolvent motor

13

sequence of events, which consists of the following.

15

First, a shipper negotiates a rate with a motor carrier,

times today — every day, under the competitive regime

18

established by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.

carrier that the carrier would file the tariff, file the

new rate.
MR. MERRILL:

3

There was no evidence of an

4

agreement, but there — the Commission specifically found

5

that Primary, the shipper, relied on Quinn, the carrier,

6

to implement the proper — implement properly the quoted

7

rates.

That's at page 43a of the petitioners' —

8

QUESTION:

So the Commission found that the

9

shipper relied on the carrier.
MR. MERRILL:

10

The Commission's finding was that

11

the shipper relied on the carrier to do everything that

12

the law requires to properly implement the negotiated

13

rate, yes.

14

QUESTION:

Doesn't every shipper do that?

I

15

mean, is that a special finding for this case?

16

every shipper assumes that the carrier is going to comply

17

with the law.

MR. MERRILL:

I assume

It probably is true that most

every shipper assumes that the carrier will comply with

the law.

I think —
QUESTION:

If that alone were a justification

22

for departing from the tariff, from the filed rate, it

would always be a justification for a departure.

MR. MERRILL:

What — I think the important

point here about the Commission's reliance element is that

1

there can be no evidence that the shipper had knowledge

2

that the carrier in fact was not intending to file the

3

rate in the tariff.

4

that the shipper, as well as the carrier, was in violation

5

of the law, and particularly had violated the Elkins Act.

6

But there is no requirement in the statute that imposes a

7

duty on the shipper to make inquiry of the carrier about

8

whether it is complying with the law.

9

That type of evidence would suggest

And so the Commission has carefully tailored its

10

negotiated rates policy to conform with the various

statutory requirements.

the element that the shipper must have been able to

reasonably rely on the carrier doing whatever the law

14

requires to lawfully implement its rate.

And that's the main purpose of

Mr. Merrill, do we take this case on

the assumption that the tariff rate was a reasonable rate?

MR. MERRILL;

The statute does require that,

QUESTION;

And are there criminal penalties and

civil penalties potentially for not doing that?
MR. MERRILL;

Yes, there are.

The carrier is

12

subject to potential criminal liability for knowingly

charging a rate less than the tariff rate, or soliciting a

rate less than the tariff rate.

MR. MERRILL:

What the Commission is doing

2

here is finding that the carrier has committed an

3

unreasonable practice by, among other things, violating

4

its statutory duties.
The petitioners have suggested, or tried to

obscure the fact of who is really at fault here,

It's the carrier that has the duty to charge and

It was billing the shipper at the negotiated rate,

you — you — you spoke as though the only obligation of

MR. MERRILL:

No, there is —

It — it is his obligation to charge

the tariff rate.

8
9

It is not.

MR. MERRILL:

It's — it's stated in -- the

first sentence of 7061(a) says the carrier must file, and

10

7062(a) says the same thing, and then the second section

11

of Section 7061(a) says the carrier must only charge and

12

collect the rate at tariff.

13

QUESTION:
that.

And — and what the Commission said —

16
17

Well, then let's charge and collect

MR. MERRILL:

And the carrier violated that

provision.
QUESTION:

What the Commission said, as Justice

18

O'Connor pointed out, is that complying with that is an

19

unreasonable billing practice.

20

MR. MERRILL:

No, the Commission has not said

21

that simply not collecting the tariff rate is an

22

unreasonable billing practice.

23

said is that when these four elements are identified —

carrier's compliance with all statutory requirements;

1

nevertheless the carrier goes ahead and charges and

2

collects the negotiated rate, not the tariff rate, over a

3

long period of time typically; and finally, many years

4

later, typically when the carrier is bankrupt, comes back

5

and attempts to collect the much higher tariff rate —

6

that that course of conduct, taken together, is an

unreasonable practice.

And when the facts are found by the Commission
that will support a finding that there is an unreasonable

10

practice, the Commission will advise the courts that the

11

unreasonable practice should preclude the carrier from

12

collecting its full tariff charges.

QUESTION:

And —

Even though the undercharging may

have put it into bankruptcy.
MR. MERRILL:

It's possible that the carrier,

through its own improvidence — went into bankruptcy.

There may be no —

QUESTION:

I would think creditors.

I think

creditors have some stake in this, don't they?
MR. MERRILL:

Yes, but I don't think there is

21

any conflict between the bankruptcy laws and the

22

Commission's negotiated rates policy.

23

- the policy doesn't apply just to bankrupt carriers.

MR. MERRILL:

That's correct, but the carrier is

7

QUESTION:

And the creditors ought to insist

that the trustee bring a lawsuit, which he did.
MR. MERRILL:

The carrier has no right to

8

collect a tariff rate that is found to be unreasonable.

9

The petitioners this morning, or this afternoon, have

10

conceded that if the Commission enters a finding that the

11

rate was unreasonable, the Commission's find even

12

unreasonableness supersedes.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

I know, but we judge this case as

though the rate was reasonable.
MR. MERRILL:

And similarly the Commission has

16

found in negotiated rates that if the carrier has

17

committed an unreasonable practice, which is defined by

18

these elements that I have summarized, that the finding of

19

an unreasonable practice should supersede the filed tariff

20

rate and prevent full collection.

21

So, essentially, the carrier or its trustee in

22

bankruptcy is — is asserting the right to collect an

23

unreasonable charge, and there is no right that creditors

24

of the bankrupt have to obtain the benefit of — of an

25

illegal charge.

or not there is any difference under the statute between

unreasonable rates and unreasonable practices, whether the

statute draws a line between those two things, such that a

finding of unreasonable practices does not supersede a

would.

essentially is that the one section, the tariff filing

whole thing that there had been the prior practice of both

agreeing to and actually billing the lower rate.

14

MR. MERRILL:

I don't think the attempt to

collect the rates adds anything to the unreasonableness.

16

It simply is the occasion on which the Commission becomes

aware that these unreasonable practices has been going on.

— I have already mentioned them,

two different negotiated rates for competing types of

QUESTION:

See, that triggers a concern that

2

isn't necessarily shown by the record of this case, the

3

possibility of discrimination, which has always been

4

something that —

5

MR. MERRILL:

Yes.

The Act still prohibits

6

discrimination.

There's no question about that.

And —

7

discrimination, however, has — is defined more narrowly

8

today than it was back in the heyday of the filed rate

9

doctrine and the Court's early decisions.

A shipper has

10

to show competitive injury in order to establish

11

discrimination, and the carrier can defeat a claim of

12

discrimination by showing that there is some relevant

13

difference in the transportation characteristics of the

14

two movements, like the costs are different, for example.

15

But if those elements are satisfied, if a

16

shipper can show competitive injury, that there is a

17

disparity in rates, that the same carrier controlled both

18

rates, and the carrier can't show a difference in costs or

19

other relevant transportation characteristics, yes,

20

discrimination is a possibility.

21

But what is really going on in the motor carrier

22

industry, and the Commission's decision reflects this, is

out first of all that the filed rate doctrine is not a

QUESTION:

Exactly.
— but it's a Commission —

it's a Commission finding of an

15

unreasonable practice which supersedes the filed rate

16

requirement.

17

Let me briefly mention the second legal issue.

18

I have said the first legal issue really was whether or

19

not the -- a different rule should apply for unreasonable

20

practices and unreasonable rates, and turn briefly to the

21

primary jurisdiction issue, since it is featured in the

22

petitioners' briefs and is an argument that can generate

23

some confusion.

24

of course, the Commission has primary jurisdiction to

25

consider an unreasonable rate referral from the Court, it

The question here is whether, although,

is that the rationale of the T.I.M.E. decision lives on,

even though T.I.M.E. was overturned by Congress.

20

under the rationale of the T.I.M.E. decision there would

21

be no basis to refer this issue to the Commission, because

22

the rationale of the T.I.M.E. decision was that the
