ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELDON E. SILVERMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

12

MR. SILVERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In the district court Curtis Guidry stipulated

13

that his former employer, the union, was entitled to a

14

judgment in the amount of $275,000 because of theft by Mr.

15

Guidry from his union employer.

16

taking of this three separate pension funds based on the

17

anti-alienation clause in the Employee Retirement Security

18

Income Act of 1974, which is also known as ERISA.

19

He, however, opposed any

The district court imposed the constructive

20

trust, indicating that it was creating only a narrow

21

exception for Mr. Guidry and in favor of the union to

22

redress the theft of union employer funds.

23

The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,

24

choosing between conflicting circuits, and chose to follow

25

that line of cases that say that federal courts have

1

inherent equitable common law powers to create exceptions

2

to a congressional enactment.
The Tenth Circuit also recognized on the

3
4

alternative argument of Mr. Guidry that a constructive

5

trust was a garnishment within the Consumer Credit

6

Protection Act, which meant that he would be entitled to

7

75 percent as an exemption.

8

held Mr. Guidry failed to preserve that right.

However, the Tenth Circuit

Today I will make three major arguments.

9

The

10

first is that Congress created the anti-alienation clause

11

in ERISA with its own three narrow exceptions, none of

12

which are applicable here.

13

is Congress, not the courts, that should make any changes

14

to ERISA.

15

Under separation of powers, it

Second, the creation of a special exemption for

16

the union based on federal labor law would effectively gut

17

the anti-alienation clause because any other judgment

18

creditor of a federal cause of action would also say that

19

its judgment was claimed to be impaired by the

20

anti-alienation clause.

21

Lastly, in the event that you find that the

22

constructive trust was properly imposed, Mr. Guidry is

23

entitled to at least 75 percent of his pension under the

24

Consumer Credit Protection Act because a constructive

25

trust clearly fits within the definition of garnishment.

Why do I say at least?

No.

You didn't mean entitled to at least.

You meant at least entitled to.
MR. SILVERMAN:

11

I imagine.

What I'm actually

12

arguing is that he's entitled under the ERISA to 100

13

percent, so I'm arguing in the alternative that if you

14

don't accept the first argument of 100, then he deserves

15

75 percent.
As to the first argument, after almost a decade

17

of study, Congress passed ERISA.

repeatedly called ERISA a comprehensive and reticulated

statute.

That has been a misinterpreted

In fact, the

action — there were competing claims in the district

of the three plans, the Local 9 plan.

1

anti-alienation is anti-alienation, and those are found in

2

the Civil Service and in other federal acts which have

mandated exemptions.

So we think LMRDA talks about a substantive

right perhaps, whereas there's another substantive right

in ERISA; namely, an exemption.

Are the narrow exceptions to the

anti-alienation provision to which you refer, are they

MR. SILVERMAN:

13

QUESTION:

Correct.

So we don't have to look outside of

14

ERISA to decide what — what is a provision that prohibits

assignment or alienation?

MR. SILVERMAN:

Correct.

The first two were

17

that you could voluntarily and revocably assign 10 percent

18

of your benefits.

19

was if you borrowed from the plan you could secure it with

20

your benefits, and then in '84 Congress allowed the QDRO,

of the Act so that divorced people, divorced spouses and

children, were also included within the rights of ERISA.

QUESTION:

I understand your statutory.

11

Supposing before ERISA was enacted you had a

12

trust of this kind administered by in this way, and a

13

fiduciary of the trust violated the LMRDA statute and

14

there were spendthrift provisions in the trust which would

15

normally be enforceable as a matter of state law.

16

Would you not agree that in enforcing the

17

federal statute that the federal judge could order relief

18

that overcome the state law obstacle?

19

MR. SILVERMAN:

Respectfully, I do not.

That's

20

the very issue in United Mine Workers v. Tony Boyle where

21

there -- it was pre-ERISA, and the argument was made that

22

Mr. Boyle's conduct was reprehensible, and the court said

23

it's reprehensible.

there's this federal labor policy in the LMRDA.

Of course, that comes up under the Treasury

MR. SILVERMAN:

Well, the reason I didn't argue

it strongly is because my principal argument is plain

15

Treasury regulation.

16

I should have, but since I felt it was plain and we didn't

back at us is we should have brought another lawsuit

That supports my argument.

The union employer in its brief concedes as it does on the

that Mr. Guidry failed to claim the exemption by filing an

That rationale was

As the case was set up, they garnished before

owed any sums because, as I had told you earlier, they

Well, the garnishee, because it's mathematically

that are -- do characterize the claims that, at least the

both that he breached duties that he owed under the

In the criminal case it was documented in the

This is the kind of —

it's also a state law case.

You'll notice in the

for relief under state law.

So you might ask the

not a totally clear history.

The Boyle case, which is the

2

D.C. Circuit case that we were talking about earlier, was

3

a case in which — it was a pre-ERISA case but it was

4

about a 1977 case covering events in the early '70s, and

5

it was a case basically in which there was a voluntary

6

spendthrift trust provision in one of these pension plans

that was voluntarily agreed to by the union that was now

trying to get around it, and the court basically said —

At any time you could

At that time, the major debate was whether

13
14

spendthrift clauses covered any torts whatsoever.

And so

15

when Congress enacted ERISA, they brought the spendthrift

16

trust provision into the federal arena, and at that time

17

they also enacted Section 514(d), and they said that we're

18

not going to impair any other federal law with this whole

19

statute; and, therefore, if the example that you give

is -- is consistent with the -- the literal language of

21

ERISA and with the statements made and with the entire

purpose of ERISA.

The remedy

that the Court chose in this case was the constructive

3

trust, which is an equitable remedy.

4

it's an equitable remedy.

There's no doubt

And what we were arguing under the CCPA is that

5
6

the equitable remedy they chose authorizes the Court to go

7

back and look at what -- what the source of the earnings

8

was and to determine whether those earnings were obtained

9

by fraud.
In this case, Mr. Guidry's earnings were

obtained by fraud.

What the opponent's position is on the CCPA is

20

that the rather typical language in that -- in that

21

statute which prohibits any legal or equitable procedure

22

to get at the earnings of a person precludes the Court

23

from engaging in that kind of analysis.

24

In other words, I guess what they're saying is

that if you commit an outright theft of money and put it

At common law I think the

and the Court said, well, we're not going to get to that

And what — what Mr. Guidry did here in large

measure was to steal money from a union, to steal some

money from the pension fund and from a welfare fund — and

by the way, the fact that he stole money from those two
