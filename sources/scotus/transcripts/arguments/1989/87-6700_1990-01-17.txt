CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

No. 87-6700, John Henry Selvage v. James A. Lynaugh.
Mr. Burr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. BURR, III

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BURR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
As in the case of Johnny Paul Penry, the jury that

11

sentenced John Selvage to death did so without being able

12

to consider or give effect to the mitigating circumstances

13

he proffered.

14

Unlike Penry's lawyers, however, John Selvage's

15

lawyers did not object to this constitutional defect in

16

his sentencing proceeding.

17

Penry claims in both of these cases got to the court of

18

criminal appeals in Texas, in the Penry case the court

19

denied the claim on the merits, and in Mr. Selvage's case

20

the court denied the claim on the basis of the procedural

21

default at trial, the failure to object.

22

As a result, when the pre-

The question before the Court today is whether the

23

court of criminal appeals' ruling should prevent the

24

Federal habeas courts from deciding the merits of Mr.

25

Selvage's Penry claim.

1

When this question was first presented to this Court

2

in Mr. Selvage's cert, petition which was filed back in

3

March of 1988, no issue was raised concerning the adequacy

4

of the state procedural ruling.

5

Since that time, however — as a matter of fact, 15

6

months after that time — when this Court announced its

7

decision in Penry at the end of June 1989, and as a result

8

of the Penry decision, there is now no state ground

9

barring review of the merits of the claim.

10

Accordingly, in the time since the question was first

11

presented in our cert, petition to the Court, a new

12

threshold question has arisen:

13

in the state courts is now based on an adequate state

14

ground.

whether the default ruling

15

QUESTION:

And now is —

16

QUESTION:

Are you saying you could right now go back

17

to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and have your claim

18

considered on the merits?

19
20
21

MR. BURR:

Your Honor, we believe that if Texas law

is applied properly, we could do that.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly with — the Texas Court of

22

Criminal Appeals would know how to apply Texas law

23

properly, I would think.

24

MR. BURR:

I would suspect they would,.

25

QUESTION:

So do you suggest we vacate and remand?

1

Is that it?
MR. BURR:

2

Your Honor, I think that the Court is in a

3

position, because of the clarity of Texas law and because

4

of the posture in which this case is in — we are here on

5

a Federal habeas proceeding with the merits not having

6

been reached because of the default ruling — this Court

7

certainly has the power, and, indeed, has usually given

8

itself the obligation to determine whether the procedural

9

ruling is an adequate state ruling.
The Court could look at state law, determine — and

10
11

we would ask that the Court do this — that the ruling is

12

no longer an adequate state ground and hold that there is

13

no default which bars consideration of claim.

14

QUESTION:

Well, would you be raising in the state

15

court arguments that you have not raised previously in the

16

state court?

17
18

MR. BURR:

Not as to the merits we would not.

The

merits were presented in the state court.

19

QUESTION:

No.

20

MR. BURR:

We would.

21

QUESTION:

Well, why do we have jurisdiction if you

22

As to the procedural bar.
The reason for that —

haven't argued it to the state court?

23

MR. BURR:

Justice Kennedy, the reason for that is

24

this.

25

Penry case was decided, as a result of those rules excused

The procedural rules in Texas at the time that the

1
2

the procedural default at trial.
For that reason, the — the ruling of the Federal

3

courts, which was based on that default, is now no longer,

4

we submit, an adequate ruling because there is no default.

5

So, as a matter of Federal habeas procedure, we are here

6

on a Federal habeas petition on a defaulted claim.

7

There is certainly a Federal interest in deciding

8

whether there is still a viable state ground for this

9

decision.

If not — and we submit this Court is empowered

10

and certainly because of the State of Texas law ought to

11

go ahead and decide the issue.

12

13
14

If there is no default, then the merits ought to be
determined in the Federal proceeding.
QUESTION:

Well, but did the — the Fifth Circuit

15

said that you were procedurally barred in this case.

16

that —

17

MR. BURR:

That's correct.

18

QUESTION:

And you're saying that subsequent

Is

19

developments in Texas law after they ruled would lead

20

anybody to say that you're no longer procedurally barred?

21

MR. BURR:

Subsequent developments from this Court's

22

decision and how that dovetails with Texas law.

23

correct.

24
25

QUESTION:

That's

Well, surely the Fifth Circuit is

better — in a better position to know than we are whether

1

there's been a change in the law of the Texas procedural

2

bar.

3
4
5

MR. BURR:

Your Honor — excuse me — I don't think

so for a couple of reason.
The rules of state law which are applicable here, we

6

submit, are plain and unequivocal.

If there was any doubt

7

so that deference to the lower Federal courts who are

8

closer to the state law might be of benefit, then I would

9

certainly agree with you.

10

QUESTION:

Well —

11

MR. BURR:

But there is no ambiguity —

12

QUESTION:

— was Penry — was Penry after the court

13

of appeals' —

14

MR. BURR:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

— decision in this case?

16

MR. BURR:

Yes, it was.

17

QUESTION:

And you say Penry then is really the key

18

to why this situation has changed.

19

MR. BURR:

Penry is the triggering event.

20

QUESTION:

You don't know what the court of appeals

21
22

23

would say if it had an issue like this before it now.
MR. BURR:

The Fifth Circuit or the court of criminal

appeals?

24

QUESTION:

The Fifth Circuit.

MR. BURR:

The Fifth Circuit, we would certainly

argue, that they ought to do as this Court should do, that

2

they should find that there is no longer an adequate state

3

ground on the basis of Texas procedural rules.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

But they haven't had any chance to say

that again since Penry?
MR. BURR:

They have not.

Not to my knowledge.

7

Certainly not in our case, and to my knowledge, they have

8

not had that opportunity in any other case.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, would the state argue abuse of the

writ for your not arguing this sooner or —
MR. BURR:

The state did argue abuse of the writ in

12

the Federal district court and in the Fifth Circuit.

It

13

has not argued that before this Court.

14

that -— I certainly don't want to suggest something to the

15

state, but —■

So my guess is

16

QUESTION:

Well, even if you —

17

MR. BURR:

— it probably would.

18

QUESTION:

Even if you're right, what are you going

19
20

to do about Teague on the Penry claim, on the merits?
MR. BURR:

Your Honor, Teague, as the Court knows in

21

Penry, the Penry decision was held to be retroactive, so

22

there would be no Teague problem in terms of

23

retroactivity.

24

itself decided that the rule would be retroactively

25

applied.

The Penry rule would apply because Penry

So, there is no Teague problem.

rule.

I thought Penry decided it wasn't a new

I mean, it was applying existing law, was it not?

3

MR. BURR:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's --

4

QUESTION:

It wasn't a retroactivity decision at all.

5

MR. BURR:

No, no.

6

QUESTION:

It was a question of determining that that

9

was the existing state of the law.
MR. BURR:

That's correct.

So it's my understanding

under the principles of Teague and — and other cases

10

addressing retroactivity that, because it's not a new rule

11

of law, persons like Mr. Selvage could have the benefit of

12

the Penry substantive ruling.

Let me review, if I could, for just a —

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Now, your cert, petition didn't raise this

procedural question?
MR. BURR:

It did not, Justice O'Connor, for one

17

reason.

18

back in March of 1988, neither Franklin had been decided

19

nor Penry.

20

state procedural rule which forgives a prior failure to

21

object was not triggered.

in which the Chambers case was decided — it involved the

and Sixth Amendment claims based upon psychiatric

testimony concerning future dangerousness.

4

After Smith v. Estelle came down, in Chambers in a

5

state habeas proceeding in a case which had not raised

6

this issue at trial, the court granted relief, holding

7

that Smith v. Estelle was the precise kind of change in

8

law from this Court which triggers this exception to the

procedural default —

10

QUESTION:

There is a certain irony — a certain

11

irony in your argument if what you're saying is that you

would argue to the Texas court that Penry was a change in

the law.

14

change in the law.

And yet we held in Penry that it was not a

governed by the Federal Constitution?
MR. BURR:

No.

Not at all.

From the perspective of

your client be excused from failing to raise the Federal

been a winner under Penry?
MR. BURR:

Well, Your Honor, it would have been a

winner under Penry after Penry.

Well, Penry raised it, didn't he?

So, for that reason it was not a new rule of

So the question is how is our situation different

from the situation described in Engle v. Isaac.

19

it's different for a number of reasons.

20

We submit

In Engle v. Isaac the petitioner at trial did not

21

raise a claim because of his view that state law rulings

22

based on state law were dead against it.

23

the state law rulings — the last state law ruling on the

24

issue -- two cases from this Court had been decided, the

25

Indeed, after

serious question the continuing validity of the state law

ruling.

3

Mr. Isaac did not go back to the state courts and

present those new constitutional arguments based on cases

5

from this Court, indeed, based on cases litigating from

6

those principles in other state and Federal courts.

did not go back to the state courts.

But for quite a

different reason.

11

is how we distinguish ourselves from the kind of futility

12

that the Court recognized in Engle.

13

For quite a different reason.

And that

What the Court recognized in Engle is that there is

14

reason to go back to the state courts if there is some new

light to be shed on prior state rulings.

the terms of the special issues were not defined enough to

allow consideration of mitigation.

The court of criminal

The argument was made that mental illness which, as

6

the Court recognized, like the mental retardation of

7

Henry, has an aggravating side and a mitigating side, only

8

got consideration as aggravation.

9

appeals said no.

The court of criminal

An argument was made, well, if — if all the special

10
11

issues are answered yes, there still may be mitigating

12

evidence that leads the jury to think life is the

13

appropriate sentence.

14

no.

The court of criminal appeals said

And finally, the last theory that was presented was,

look, at the very least the jury ought to be given a kind

17

of a soft nullification instruction.

told that in answering the special issues if you think

19

mitigation should lead to a life sentence, you can answer

them no.

They ought to be

Is that a possibility that that is the

4

MR. WALT:

I don't believe that there is any

1

Is it -- is it 100 percent certain that if

2

we decide this case on the basis that for present purposes

3

we'll assume that the court below figured out the Texas

court correctly, what the Texas rule was about default?

5

Is it 100 percent certain that if that is wrong, this

6

defendant can go back into the Texas courts?

7

MR. WALT:

Absolutely.

There is no — there really

8

is no viable abuse of the writ posture.

And, in fact, if

9

there is any abuse of the writ concept in the Texas courts

10

in capital cases, it would certainly be excused by the

11

fact that — if he is correct, that this is a change in

12

the law, then he would be certainly free to go back into

state court.

14

that.

15

There is no — there is nothing to stop

Mr. Penry — oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

Mr. Selvage

16

asserts that cause exists for his procedural default.

this Court noted — as some of the questions that I've

heard noted, Lockett v. Ohio clearly predated Mr. Penry —

or, Mr. Selvage's trial.

This Court's opinion in Penry dictates the result

on -- as far as whether there is novelty for his

precedent that exists prior to the trial, a person can

never claim novelty as an exception to the procedural

default.

Excuse me, I'd like to

The concept of futility — and this is nothing more

than futility — has been firmly established that that

cannot constitute cause for a procedural default.

Murray.

even Engle.
In Smith v. Murray, it was a constitutional claim

12

that was presented to the state courts.

13

whether there was a violation — or the defaulting claim

14

was one of whether there was an Estelle v. Smith error

15

for — in having the psychiatrist testify in violation of

16

the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.

And that was

In that case, specifically, the — this Court found

18

that that claim had been percolating and that even though

19

the state court — even though counsel could reasonably

20

have concluded that the state court would never have

21

granted him relief, the fact remains that the tools were

22

available for him to formulate a constitutional challenge.

23

There simply is no difference in this case.

In this

24

case,, for instance, Mr. Selvage suggests that the state

25

rule foreclosed consideration of the claim.

If one looks at the existence of the state

of the

2

state law at the time, there could be nothing further than

3

the truth.

4

Selvage cites involve not as applied constitutional

challenge but, rather, facial challenges.

6

The claim -- most of the cases that Mr.

In each of the cases, even though they state that

7

mitigating evidence couldn't be considered, it was in the

8

abstract, stating that because the concepts of

9

deliberate — the "deliberately" was not defined, for

10

instance; therefore, it was somehow -- somehow might have

11

allowed in the abstract the — that mitigating evidence

12

could not be considered.

13

In — in none of those cases did -- did the

14

Petitioner — or did the Appellant state that he presented

mitigating evidence which could not be considered.

understand the difference between "as applied" and "facial

challenges," is a person — especially in the Penry

18

context, it would be the idea that I have mitigating

19

evidence; it cannot be considered.

22

As I

Certainly, none of those cases stand for that
proposition.
The one case that does stand for the proposition is

23

Quinones v. State.

Quinones was decided one month prior

24

to Selvage's trial.

25

Court had not ruled on certiorari by the time Selvage's

Quinones had not sought, and this

trial resulted.
Even if the Court were to somehow adopt any concept

3

of foreclosure one case subsequent to Lockett — and no

4

determination of certiorari by this Court could hardly

5

constitute foreclosure.

6

This Court has — turning to the question of whether

7

there is a fundamental miscarriage of justice — this

8

Court has recognized that principles of finality

9

underlying the procedural default obviously have to give

10

way where such fundamental miscarriages have resulted.

11

The case of Carrier — Murray v. Carrier first

12

addressed the question of what constituted a fundamental

13

miscarriage of justice.

14

In previous cases, both in Engle — in Engle and in

15

fact Carrier, they rejected the concept that there would

16

be a fundamental miscarriage of justice — this Court

17

rejected the concept that a fundamental miscarriage of

18

justice would constitute an undermining of the fact —

19

reliability of the fact-finding process.

20

concept that if — that the error impacted on

21

fundamental — the fundamental fairness of the trial.

22

It rejected the

This Court stated that that was nothing more than

1

fundamental miscarriage of justice is, is that whatever

2

happens, a fundamental miscarriage of justice must be a

3

far narrower focus than whatever would constitute cause

4

under — under Wainwright v. Sykes.

5

To have any — any larger focus than that, or the

6

same focus, would in fact undermine the cause and

7

prejudice standard.

8

9

Therefore, this Court adopted the concept that there
would be fundamental miscarriage of justice only in the

10

event that a defendant could show that the error probably

11

resulted in the conviction of a person who was actually

12

innocent.

13

The Court specifically —

and translated it, which is a — a question of historical
fact — and translated those into the concept of a
largely — of a profoundly moral question of whether
somebody should — should live or should die.
Now, this Court has, of course, decided that certain
classes of persons are not eligible for a death sentence.
Persons who are under the age of 16.

Persons who are —

persons who would fit within the Enmund or Tison rule.
Those people are — and — and — those people are not
eligible for sentence and obviously a defendant who —
those would be historical facts that a court could
conclude.
So if, of course, Penry, alleged Penry error resulted
in the exclusion of evidence that would establish that, we
could of course demonstrate that a person was actually
innocent or the death sentence in that regard.
Amicus for the state suggest that this Court should
go no further and just avoid entering the subjective
morass of morality which would inevitably result from this
Court adopting, particularly the rule of that Mr. Selvage
suggests, any concept that somehow he deserves — that a
Federal court, years after the fact, would state that he
deserves the death penalty, number one, in my opinion, it
would — would do nothing more than restate what the
prejudice prong of — of Strickland v. Washington is since

1

in effect of assistance of counsel is in fact a standard

2

for cause to excuse a procedural default.

3

nothing more than the prejudice standard of Strickland

4

would in fact negate in effect of assistance of counsel as

5

cause for a procedural default.

6

To repeat

Since this Court obviously intends — or, certainly

7

appears to want to have a far narrower focus than that

8

which constitutes cause, it necessarily has to be a

9

greater — a narrower inquiry than whether a person

10
11

deserves a death sentence.
Moreover, to say that he — to have a habeas court

12

ten — in this case, ten years later, decide what --

13

whether a person deserves a death sentence is -- is

14

nothing more than to ask for de novo fact-finding on a

15

moral question when the Court has neither heard the

16

evidence, viewed the evidence, viewed the demeanor of the

17

witnessed who testified; and, in fact, would amount to —

18

would amount to nothing more than a habeas court imposing

19

its moral judgment on — on fact-finders who very well may

20

never have possessed the identical moral judgment.

21

Thus, the state has suggested a standard which

22

would — which would, I think, narrow the discretion -- so

23

narrow the discretion of the — of the habeas court

24

reviewing for a fundamental miscarriage of justice and

25

actual innocence of the death penalty.

And that would be

to revise the Jackson v. Virginia standard so that — to

2

force the habeas court to look through the eyes of a

3

rational juror.

4

If the jury were properly instructed, if it were

5

presented with the evidence, would that jury -- would a

6

jury — or could a habeas court conclude that no rational

7

juror would have reached the same result, that being a

8

death sentence?

9

We fell that adopting that standard, if a standard is

10

to be adopted at all — and I'm -- I — we agree entirely

11

with amicus that we should probably stop at the — whether

12

they fit within an excluded class of the death penalty —

13

but if this Court is to adopt a standard, it must take

14

pains to avoid the — the idea of imposing moral judgment

15

years after the fact — upon —■ upon the proper — the

16

proper vehicle — the proper fact-finders which would be,

17

of course, the jury or a judge in a —

18
19

To adopt Mr. Selvage's rule, the Court would do —
pardon me.

20

In — I would wish to close at this point and I would

21

ask the Court to recall that it has taken great strides to

22

ensure the reliability — or assure — ensure the

23

preeminence of a trial and the direct appeal process.

To adopt — to adopt Selvage's proposal as to what

2

constitutes cause would be nothing more than to allow

3

Selvage to do what Penry could not do, and that would be a

de facto overruling or Jurek v. Texas.

nothing more than ask — than render a trial as a
