ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The issue in this case is whether uninsured

11

demand notes which were advertised as investments and

12

purchased by thousands of ordinary people for more than

13

$10 million are securities.

14

Under any proper application of the 1934 act,

15

these notes are securities and their purchasers are

16

protected.

17

Let me briefly touch the facts.
These notes were sold by the Farmer's Co-Op of

There is nothing in the record

to delineate the exact division.

Anything to indicate that the number

of notes sold to non-members was substantial or
significant, or any finding like that at all?
MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

4

Well, the finding by the court

5

was a general finding that the notes were offered — I'm

6

sorry -- sold to the public.

7

those purchasers were also members of the Co-Op, there is

no precise record.

the year you could get a patronage dividend if your

14

purchases were sufficient.

This was a rural community and the Co-Op

16

Op had outlets and was headquartered was about 70,000 --

23,000 people were Co-Op members.

almost coextensive.

What do you think the purpose was of

the exclusion by Congress of notes with a maturity date of
less than nine months?
MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

11

The purpose of the exclusion

12

was to exclude commercial paper not offered to the public.

13

And the basis for that conclusion is —

14

QUESTION:

Well, what if there were a note due

15

and payable in six months that was for investment

16

purposes.

17

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

We believe that a note offered

18

as an investment and widely sold with a six-month maturity

19

would be a security.

QUESTION:

It would not be excluded by —
Notwithstanding the language in the

statute, which is rather clear.
MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

Well, Your Honor, the statute

has a couple of things that are pertinent.

25

requires," which has been interpreted consistently by this

Number one is

Court and others to require an investigation into the

circumstances of the transaction to see whether regulation

or treatment of the instrument as a security would fulfill

or would be necessary to satisfy Congress' purpose to

protect investors.

QUESTION:

Have the exceptions been construed in

the light of that introductory phrase?
MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

Every lower court — federal -

10

QUESTION:

Has this Court ever done that?

11

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

This Court has not addressed

12

this specifically.

The cases to which I refer are cases

13

dealing with the definition of a security in which this

14

Court has expressly investigated the context of the

15

transaction to see whether defining the instrument as a

16

security would be consistent or required by Congress'

17

purpose to regulate investors.

QUESTION:

Mr. McCambridge, I'm sure that the

19

purpose of this thing was to exclude commercial paper.

But they could have said that.

I mean, maybe this isn't commercial paper, but

Well, the first point.

I'd

like to bring you back to the fact that on an absolutely

10

literal reading, which I think is what you're talking

11

about, demand notes are not mentioned.
QUESTION:

12

Second —

Well, isn't it true that on a literal

13

reading even a note with a term, once the term arrives, it

14

becomes a demand note thereafter doesn't it?

15

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

I think that the statute says

16

at the time of issuance and deals with notes with fixed

17

terms.

18

purchasers will treat demand notes in a variety of ways.

19

Sometimes they may be, as Arthur Young argues, more like a

20

short-term note.

21

And you can see from the record here that

Other times, more like a long-term note.

QUESTION:

Well, do you want to rest on the

22

proposition that no demand note is covered by the

23

exception so that case-by-case we're going to have to look

24

at demand notes to see if they're investments?

1

reading is the proper reading.

2

reading is that to conclude that the exclusion means

3

commercial paper not offered to the public as a general

4

matter — that's the proper way to approach this.

5

then to examine notes — other notes — with an eye

6

towards determining whether they are investments or

commercial.

QUESTION:

I think that the proper

And

Well, to say that you're not going to

be literal in one respect where you obviously can't be

10

literal is not to say that you're not going to be literal

11

in any respects, which is what you are urging upon us.

12

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

I am suggesting that the

13

explicit language of the statute requires -- Congress'

14

language — requires an examination of context.

15

reason that Congress requires that is because, as this

16

Court has noted in several cases, there is a need to be

17

flexible in this area to both effectuate Congress' purpose

18

and to deal with the many different sorts of financial

19

instruments which promoters devised to separate people

20

from their money, which is what happened here.

21

And the

This Court has indicated in the Securities

22

Industry Association case in dicta that the exclusion

23

about which we are talking now is an explicit exception

24

for commercial paper.

25

And the definition used by Congress came from

said, this is about commercial paper; we want an exemption

for commercial paper.

5

that would be appropriate because, they said, commercial

And they persuaded Congress that

13

These are for sophisticated

On the literal point — let me turn to the

14

effect of the test as proposed by Arthur Young.

15

Young does want this read absolutely literally, except for

16

the demand note point which I've already noted.

17

Arthur

And Arthur Young's conclusion is that the only

18

thing that matters is maturity.

19

Congress' purpose doesn't matter.

20

doesn't matter.

Whether people buy them as investments

21

doesn't matter.

The only thing that is of any concern is

22

this nine-month bright line test.

23

Context doesn't matter.
How they are advertised

And every lower court which has taken a look at

24

this has said that's a perverse result which would be at

25

odds with the purpose of this statute.

every three-year note which a consumer issues in

connection with his purchase of a car would be a security,

day investment notes, which is exactly the scheme that

5

Ponzi used in the '20s in Boston — 45-day notes publicly

offered as investments — would be unregulated.

7

The analysis that this Court has used in all of

8

its decisions concerning the proper definition of a

security has been to give effect to what Congress was

trying to do.

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

No, it does not.

are, first of all, the language of the statute.

important for us to start — and one of the reasons why we

endorsed the family resemblance test is that of all the

And it's

Well, if the language of the statute

MR. LAZERWITZ:

The maturity — the statutory

exclusion in the '34 act, in our view, as Petitioners

Why on earth would one draw the inference when Congress

says a note with a maturity of less than nine months you

would draw the opposite inference, that they had something

else in mind?

Well, why?

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, because they said any

those four terms, next to each other, mean something.

12

They mean — those are — that's Congress' way of

describing commercial paper.

It's a very strange way to describe

Notice,

But there is something other than the language

and the structure of that particular exclusion.

Apart from both the language — we urge the

10

Court that the structure of that exclusion means

11

something.

12

purposes of the securities laws call for that exclusion to

13

be read the way we suggest, because it would make no

14

sense.

15

Apart from the legislative history, the

years ago, going up through Landreth, that we cannot

QUESTION:

What function would it have, because,

5

as you say, you would just look to see if it has a family

6

resemblance and the nine months doesn't matter.

7

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Under the family resemblance

8

test with cfespe a short-term notes, the test would proceed

9

as follows.

10

The test first starts with the statutory

11

language defining a security as including any note, and

12

then takes account of the exclusionary language, and then

13

construes those provisions in light of the preparatory

14

clause unless the context otherwise requires.

15

For example, a note having in it a maturity date

16

of less than nine months is initially presumed not to be a

17

security, following the statutory language.

18

party seeking to overcome that presumption, for example,

19

in this case, would have to show that the context

20

otherwise requires.

But then the

21

The first thing that party would show is, look,

22

this isn't commercial paper, so I can't be shut out under

23

the securities laws for that reason.

24

or, actually, the way the test works, it would have been

25

the first — my note doesn't resemble both types of notes

The second step —

that all would agree fall outside the scope of the

securities laws.
So, we think the exclusionary language does have

a place.

6

the general description of commercial paper."

could be — it hasn't happened yet, but there might be an

as commercial paper within the strictures of let's say the

16

that it writes it out of the act.

Yes, Justice White.

And — but then you run to the

the opposite, that the statute of limitations begins to

run from the time a demand is made.

MR. MATSON:

MR. MATSON:

The date of its issuance.

13

That's just simply the source of the body of law that says

result, Petitioners and the government would have the

Court read into the 1934 act language that simply is not

there.

4

And they would have the Court do this in two ways.
Either to take an exemption from registration,

what's been referred to as the commercial paper exemption,

6

out of the 1933 act and read it as if it were in the 1934

act.

Or, alternatively, they'd take four words that
are in the exclusion — note, draft, bill of exchange,

10

bankers of acceptance — and say what Congress really

11

meant by those four phrases was commercial paper.

12

Now, first, in the 1934 act when Congress wanted

13

to refer to commercial paper, it did.

apologize — in our brief, but in rereading the original

So, not having the characteristics of those

notes and similar instruments that are undoubtedly

securities, the Landreth test then goes to the second

stage, the Howey test, which this Court said in Landreth

was the appropriate test for all unusual instruments,

which these demand notes certainly appear to be.

And that's true whether it's

decision, for example, with the kind of risk of market

8

So, at the first level —

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, there was some market

fluctuation here on interest rates, wasn't there?
MR. MATSON:

The interest rate was moved by the

12

Co-Op in accordance with the money markets.

But the

13

interest rate constantly would change periodically and an

14

investor could immediately demand their money if they

15

didn't like where the Co-Op had moved the interest rate.

16

So, there isn't the kind of market risk there

17

where somebody, for example, is locked into an interest

18

rate over a long term or watches the value of capital

19

appreciate or depreciate.

20

right to immediate payment is at odds with the concept of

21

investment.

22

It's simply the concept — the

Similarly, with the portion of the Howey test

23

24

of others, this Court has dealt on several occasions with

And it has

1

said profit refers to either capital appreciation or

2

earnings as in the sense of dividends.

3

Now, an economist could define profit very

4

broadly.

Probably benefits that I wouldn't even think of.

5

But for securities law purposes, the Court has focused on

6

the kind of profit one expects with a securities

7

instrument.

8

in Forman as either capital appreciation or earnings in

9

the form of dividends.

And that the Court identified, for example,

In the Court's Weaver decision, the Court dealt

10
11

with an interest-bearing instrument and it distinguished

12

for this purpose that instrument from the one before the

13

Court in the Tcherepnin case which were withdrawable

14

capital shares that paid dividends.

15

The Court drew that context, that with dividends

16

there was the earnings of the entity, the anticipation of

17

that, that didn't exist where what was being paid simply

18

was -- simply was interest.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Matson, these notes had language

20

in them to the effect that if they weren't paid at

exclusion was limited to commercial paper.

I was

No — two courts have dealt with demand notes,

two courts of appeals.

Tenth Circuit in 1989.

that they are.

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

That they were securities.

They were widely offered as investments, the things that

we say should matter.

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

They were not excluded by them?
Correct.

That's correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

The — the Securities Act definition

14

of commercial paper, which we've been told is — is the

15

same as the words used here, it really isn't.

16

government sort of — it's in footnote 12 of the

17

government's brief, but the government does acknowledge

18

that in the Securities Act there is added to this — this

19

recitation of notes and so forth that they have to be used

20

for current transactions.

21

And that language is not contained in the

exchange act.

So, why — why should one think that the

MR. McCAMBRIDGE:

That is the single exclusion.

The rest of it is identical.

history as to the reason for the omission.

2

Now, there's two possibilities.

One, Congress

3

meant to exclude only short-term commercial paper not

4

offered to the public.

5

is Congress also meant to exclude short-term investment

6

notes widely offered to the public.

7

Or, what Arthur Young says, which

We suggest, and I think Judge Friendly has

8

indicated, that interpretation is inconceivable because

9

the Senate and the House said the definitions of security

10

in the '33 and '34 Acts are substantially the same.

11

reading of it, the reading that every court of appeals has

12

given it, is consistent with that.

Our

Those two definitions of securities are

substantially the same.

Their reading, I suggest, would create two

17

definitions that would be widely different and there's no

18

basis for it, no history to it, and it is incomprehensible

19

that that's what they wanted to do.
Arthur Young's alternative test -- the number
