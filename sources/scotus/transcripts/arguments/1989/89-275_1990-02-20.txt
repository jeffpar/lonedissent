unique task of arguing to you about what you probably

meant, must have meant, when you considered rules

committee, the judicial conference, and you approved them

21

for submission to the Congress and they were in fact

Briefly, the facts are as follows.

15

The

16

litigation that resulted in sanctions began as a suit on a

17

contract brought by a subsidiary of the Hartmarx Company

18

against a client of Petitioner -- Petitioner's law firm

19

Cooter & Gell.
This suit was met with a counterclaim, a

20
21

Robinson-Patman counterclaim, and thus began the

22

litigation that ended up in this Court with the sanctions

23

issue.

24

As the investigation into the counterclaim took

place and facts were gathered, Petitioner discovered what

complaint, the information that was relied upon, anything

Well, if I might jump ahead in the law for a

5

moment, if we had the benefit of all the cases, if we had

whereby in camera you could go before the district court

10

and make certain representations that wouldn't be

experienced client, a client that had been in the men's

case -- before the merits were even to be addressed.

9

QUESTION:

We don't have before us, do we, the

10

question of whether it was appropriate for the district

11

court to impose sanctions?

12

MR. SALTZBURG:

No, sir.

The -- the issue

13

before the Court is whether -- you don't have before you

14

the question of the amount of sanctions or whether the

15

district court abused its discretion.

16

review of both those questions.

17

The Court denied

It did grant review on the issue of what the

18

standard of review should be, whether it should be a

19

clearly erroneous standard and, to some extent, the

20

propriety of imposing sanctions would, of course, depend

21

on the scope of review that the appellate court should

22

have used.

23

If the Court decides that a higher standard

24

should have been used than the court of appeals, the Court

25

would, under the question granted, be justified in

There are prior opinions of the District of

QUESTION :

And that's what you 're going to

argue, I take it .

9

MR . SALTZBURG:

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. SALTZBURG:

Immediately.

The first argument that the

12

Petitioner makes to this Court is that Rule 4l(a)(l)(i),

13

which, if the Court permits, I'll refer as Rule 41 to

14

avoid being tongue-tied and each time meaning that

15

particularly -- particular subsection of t he Rule .

16

We submit that the second circuit was correct

17

when it said that when a voluntary dismissal is filed

18

under Rule 41, the case ends.

19

Rule 11 sanctions may no longer be imposed.

20

QUESTION:

And when the case ends,

Mr. Salzman, would a court, a

21

district court, have continued power to go after a lawyer

22

on a contempt sanction after a voluntary dismissal?

way from a Rule 11 sanction which does seem to be one

2

designed to address what the attorney did, not what the

3

client did so much?

4

MR. SALTZBURG :

5

answer to that , I want to be clear.

6

Justice O'Connor , to give a full

Our position is that with respect to criminal

u.s.c.

contempt, 18

1927 , the

8

penalty provision for lawyers who vexatiously multiply

9

proceedings, that the court's power to impose and to

10

consider contempt and penalties on the lawyer under that

11

statute are not -- are not ended when a Rule 4l(a)(i)

12

dismissal is filed.

13

And the reason is that the Congress has provided

14

by statute for very particularized sanctions for the most

15

egregious forms o f behavior and that prior to the

16

amendment in 1983 of Rule 11 there was no indication that

17

contempt or other sanctions for misbehavior, particular

18

affront to the court, couldn't be considered.

19

What we have today, and the reason this case we

20

submit is different than the issues presented from those

statutory provisions, particularly contempt, is that we

22

have your rules.

to 23(e), the class action rule which requires the judge

2

consider notice to the class before the dismissal becomes

3

final, and 66, the receiver's rule.

4

No one suggested when -- in 1983 when the rule

state which had the federal rules, as well in the federal

MR. SALTZBURG:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

let me perhaps answer that in two -- two ways.
The arguments that Respondents make to the Court

21

-- now, the Court, of course, can accept less of this

22

argument -- the arguments that Respondents make is that

23

indeed Rule 11 does give the federal district court the

24

power to dismiss the case with prejudice as a sanction,

25

notwithstanding Rule 41 saying dismissal will be without

prejudice.
They are -- and they are in effect forced to

2

3

that position because all o f the cases decided in the

4

lower court say that the district judge has essentially a

5

whole array of sanctions, whatever the district judge

6

deems appropriate .
And their argument is that that is -- you can

7
8

square that reading of Rule 11 with Rule 41 by simply

9

saying that the with prejudice is a penalty imposed

10

because of a Rule 11 violation and that somehow that

11

doesn't interfere with Rule 4l's guarantee to the client

12

that dismissal would be without prejudice.

13

QUESTION:

Well, you could -- you could argue it

14

that way.

But you could -- you could also argue that

15

that prejudice is an available sanction where it's an

16

available sanction and that it's simply not availabl e

17

where there's been a timely dismissal before an answer has

18

been filed.

19

Why can't you say it's simply not available

20

under Rule 11 where there's been a Rule 41 dismissal?

fact, in our judgment, required as a fair construction of

2

the two rules at a minimum.

3

goes back to the question that the Chief Justice put about

4

what the effect would be of a -- of a dismissal.

5

But beyond that, and this

One of the things that Rule 11 does, at least if

6

our argument is accepted and the law, at least as it's

7

developing now, is that there are at least minimum

B

procedural requirements that must be employed before any

9

sanctions are imposed.

10

One of those requirements is, at least in some

11

instances where the sanction is severe, that there be

12

fact-finding by the court.

13

give rise to collateral estoppal fact unless there is an

14

appeal and unless the appeal is -- produces a -- an

15

overturning of the lower court's decision.

16

And those facts may very well

What happens on Rule 11 is there are no

sanctions in the abstract.

There are sanctions because

the district judge makes a decision that something was

wrong.

21

have a situation in which 41 says you can dismiss without

prejudice, but Rule !l's dismissal may in fact be, as a

practical matter, prejudicial not only in the sense of

economically prejudicial but prejudicial in the very legal

because he didn't really find out that they were true in

time.

3

MR. SALTZBURG:

Justice Stevens, that's

4

theoretically possible, that the judge will say that in

5

some cases that A, B and C are true, the lawyer alleged

6

them to be true, but the lawyer didn't really know that

7

they were true, and could i mpose sanctions for that

reason.

11

In other cases, the judge may in fact say
they're not true.

Now,

In other words, he could be

12

sanctioned for filing a meritorious complaint if he didn't

13

investigate it thoroughly enough to begin with.

MR. SALTZBURG:

MR. SALTZBURG:

Yeah.
He may also be sanctioned -- and

this is a problem with the construction of Rule 11 that

19

it may also be the case that the judge will say facts A, B

20

and C are untrue.

21

Now, Justice Scalia may be correct.

He didn't

22

have to say that.

And we could make an argument perhaps

down the line in some court that a judge who so found was

going beyond what that judge had to do, that he should

investigate.

3

But there's no guarantee that argument in fact
will win and that it won't be a preclusive effect.

4

The other thing, if I might say, about -- Mrs.

5

O'Connor, back to the question you asked -- about the

6

Court's construction, why this is different from contempt,

7

is that if the Court decides that Rule 11 sanctions may be

8

imposed after a voluntary dismissal, the Court essentially

9

is -- is saying, because the rule allows that they can be

10

imposed sua sponte, any time without time limits.

11

The time limits this Court has provided in its

12

rules for various things -- for example, to reopen a

13

judgment -- would have no force in effect.

14

When this Court looked at the attorney's fees

15

question when an application for attorney 's fees under

16

statute ought to be -- ought to have to be filed, the

17

Court struggled with whether that 59(3) time limit, the

18

10-day time limit should apply, and it ended up saying no

19

because this was a statutory creature.

20

But this is a rule creature and the -- it is

21

it is the case which -- that if the Court decides that

22

Rule 11 sanctions remain available forever, that no time

23

limit otherwise provided in the law has any force and

24

effect.

point -- get at the point in response.

6

These arguments about presenting us with a copy

7

of the complaint before filing the complaint were

6

presented to the district court, were debated during

argument and were referred to in affidavits filed by

10

Petitioner's senior partner before the district court.

11

The district court concluded that they never

asked us for our view of the facts, that if they had asked

us, they wouldn't have believed us, and the whole approach

14

was made in the context of trying to leverage a settlement

of the existing litigation as well as paying them more

Nothing the advisory committee notes on Rule 11

2

indicates that it was intended to be a fee-shifting

3

statute or rule for appeal.

4

With respect to the tripartite analysis that we

5

urge upon you in terms of scope of review, you're right,

6

Mr. Chief Justice, it's likely to produce more appeals.

7

It's likely to produce more careful appellate review, it's

8

like to have lawyers corning up to the courts of appeals

9

more often.

10

It's what this case is about.

It really is

11

about where the lawyer is hamstrung with questions of

12

attorney/client privilege back at a time where they didn't

13

know how to deal with that question and put forth all the

14

facts before the district court -- whether they're

15

entitled to careful findings, the most careful kinds of

16

scrutiny before the district judge rules, and whether

17

before their reputations are impugned they're entitled to

careful appellate review.

We submit that they are.
