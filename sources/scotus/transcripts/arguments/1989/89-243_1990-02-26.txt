ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY J. MALLOY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MALLOY:

may it please the Court:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

We are here on certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

12

This suit was filed in 1983 to stop Medtronic

13

from infringement of two basic patents related to a

14

medical device known as an automatic implantable

15

defibrillator.

16

below arguing that its infringing activities were exempt

17

from the patent infringement laws based on a 1984 statute.

18

The question before this court is the

Medtronic defended in part in the court

19

interpretation of that statute, which is 35 U.S.C. Section

20

271(e)(1).

21

act of infringement to manufacture, use or sell a patented

22

invention solely for uses reasonably related to the

23

development and submission of information under a Federal

24

law regulating drugs.

interpretation of that statute.

2

and has no application whatever to other nondrug products

3

regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, namely,

4

medical devices, color additives and food additives.

5

It applies to drugs only,

The statute refers on its face only to drugs.

6

The statutory definition of drugs in the FDA Act excludes

7

specifically devices.

8

treated drugs differently from devices from 1906 until the

9

present.

A century of FDA legislation has

10

Now, Medtronic argues that the phrase "Federal

11

law regulating drugs" — and it takes that phrase out of

12

context -- Medtronic, the respondent, argues that the

13

phrase "Federal law regulating drugs" equals and means the

14

entire Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and even the nondrug

15

products.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, the court though so too, didn't

it?
MR. MALLOY:

No, Your Honor.

The court, I

19

suggest -- well, the court of appeals did not analyze what

20

the phrase Federal law regulating drugs meant.

21

court did was go to one piece of the legislative history

22

dealing with their analysis of what the Roche Bolar

23

decision had done and look at that.

24
25

What the

And, in fact, the court decision when it goes to
the words of the statute simply leads off by saying we

conclude that this statute covers any patented invention

2

so long as it's for the limited purposes enumerated.

3

it never discusses how — what the meaning of the

4

remaining phrase is and how does that fit into the

5

statute.

6

And I suggest one of the errors of the court of

7

appeals' opinion which Medtronic has failed to support is

8

that it doesn't deal with the specific language of the

9

statute.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Malloy, am I right the critical

11

language of the statute is, "a Federal law which regulates

12

the manufacture, use or sale of drugs"?

13

MR. MALLOY:

No, Your Honor.

I would suggest

14

that the critical language starts with after "solely for

15

use as reasonably related to," and then we focus, "the

16

development and submission of information under a Federal

17

law regulating drugs."

18

QUESTION:

No, under -- well, but is the last

19

language -- I

20

-- I just want to make sure I have the last part of the

21

language correct.

22

MR. MALLOY:

QUESTION:

24
25

Oh, absolutely.
"Which regulates the manufacture, use

or sale of drugs."
MR. MALLOY:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

2

MR. MALLOY:

Thank you.
Now, if -- if Medtronic's

3

construction is accepted, what we have then is the

4

inclusion in the exemption by a matter of mere

5

happenstance, a product is now included, even though not

6

referred to, just because it happens to have been

7

regulated under the Federal law, the FD&C Act that also

8

regulates drugs.

9

Indeed, what we wind up with is the — the

10

absurd result, I suggest, that the law would mean the

11

same, that the medical devices and color additives would

12

be equally well included if the statute read "Federal law

13

regulating color additives" or "Federal law regulating

14

cosmetics" since these products, too, like drugs, are all

15

regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

16

QUESTION:

Well, how do you -- how do you answer

17

the argument, though, that the law -- the Federal Food and

18

Drug Act, or whatever the -- the Federal Drug, Cosmetic

19

and so forth — is a law regulating the sale of drugs?

20
21

MR. MALLOY:
many products.

QUESTION:

MR. MALLOY:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, it's a law regulating

Right.
Drugs are one, devices are another.
But is it not a law regulating the

sale of drugs?

1
2

Out of context I think it might be

referred to as that, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

4

MR. MALLOY:

Well —
Within the context of the statute,

5

especially where they have already referred to the entire

act —
QUESTION:

7

Your position is the Federal Food and

8

Drug Act is not a law relating — regulating the sale of

9

drugs?

10
11
12

MR. MALLOY:

Within the context of this statute,

yes, Your Honor.
If I take the — if I take the lines out of

13

context and I say can I sit there and look at that phrase

14

out of context, I would say yes, it is possible.

15

we consider that we have the FDA Act itself defining drugs

16

as "excluding devices" — when we have the legislative

17

history specifically stating that the only activity that

18

is being exempted is drug testing activity and when we

19

have the fact that other nondrug products, such as medical

20

devices, color additives and food additives, are developed

21

and submitted under different laws, different provisions

22

of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, then are drugs, then I

23

say yes, Your Honor, it is not -- the Food, Drug and

24

Cosmetic Act within the context of this statute and all of

25

its provisions are not —

QUESTION:

1

What it means, in other words, is the

provisions of the law regulating drugs, which regulate

3

drugs?

MR. MALLOY:

5

QUESTION:

I missed the question, but —
You're saying it should be — it's

6

meant to read "under any provision of the law regulating

7

drugs, which provisions also regulate drugs."
MR. MALLOY:

is saying, which happened to regulate drugs or anything
else.

Anything else covered by the statute

regulating drugs is their position.

13
14

And what I am saying -QUESTION:

11
12

Well, I think that's what Medtronic

MR. MALLOY:

Yes.

And — and what I — what I

am --

15

QUESTION:

And your position is covered by the

16

portions of the statute regulating drugs that do regulate

17

drugs?

18

The portions that regulate drugs.
MR. MALLOY:

What I'm saying is it — it — the

19

law that regulates -- regulates for development and

20

submission -- for example, in drugs, is Section 355 of the

21

Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

22

360(e) and (j) and different provisions for the different

23

nondrug products.

24

regulating drugs, they literally meant drugs and they did

25

not mean nondrug products such as devices.

For devices it would be

And when they said Federal law

drugs.

They did not mean law regulating

They meant portion of law regulating drugs.

3

MR. MALLOY:

4

Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act —

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MALLOY:

Well, they didn't mean the entire

Right.
-- since they've already referred

7

to that just three lines above and had they intended to

8

use that phrase, they would have.

9

Now, I would suggest with respect to the — the

10

absurd result that I think is caused by Medtronic's

11

interpretation -- that is, the law would have meant the

12

same thing under Medtronic's interpretation if it said

13

Federal law regulating cosmetics or color additives --

14

that that alone suggests it's an unreasonable

15

interpretation that Medtronic is suggesting.

16

Now, I believe that Congress would not have been

17

so haphazard and so totally inconsistent with the term

18

drugs as it's used throughout the Food, Drug and Cosmetic

19

Act and that Congress was not so inconsistent.

20

QUESTION:

Why is it that in answering the Chief

21

Justice's first question you were insistent that the

22

critical words of the statute include "solely for uses

23

reasonably related to the development submission"?

24

you tell us that?

MR. MALLOY:

Yes.

under different sections of the law for different products

2

that are regulated within the drug and device field.

3

submission for drugs is made under 355, submission for

4

devices under 360(e) and (j), and so on.

5

I believe, under 348, and food additives under 376.

6

And

Color additives,

So, when Congress was talking about development

7

and submission, that's what they were talking about.

8

didn't intend to refer to the entire act.

9

so, they would have used the phrase,

They

Had they done

"the entire Food,

10

Drug and Cosmetic Act" as they did a few lines above in

11

the very same statute.

12

Now, the legislative history —

13

QUESTION:

You're -- you're -- excuse me.

Are

14

you saying that under a Federal law means under -- under a

15

Federal law requiring development and submission?

16

say it refers to the particular section of the law?

17

that your position?

MR. MALLOY:

So, you
Is

It — it does if that — it can

19

also refer to an act, Your Honor, if the act does nothing

20

but regulate drugs and if all of its provisions are drug

21

regulatory.

22

So, it -- it — it may refer to a section in the

23

case -- the section is a drug-only section, or it may

24

refer to an act if it's a drug-only act, but it refers

25

only to the provisions that do the regulation and require

submission of — of information under a drug law.
QUESTION:

Is there a question of the Food --

3

Food and Drug Act that requires the development and

4

submission of information only relating to drugs?

5

MR. MALLOY:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, and that's 355.
Then wouldn't the natural way to

7

explain the position, say under Section 355 of the act, if

8

it means what you say?

9

MR. MALLOY:

Your Honor, they might have done

10

that and -- and that's — that's an alternative way they

11

could have done it.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

And that's the meaning you're —

you're saying that's what the statute really means?
MR. MALLOY:

Well, I'm not limiting it to 355

15

because, of course, we have biological products -- I mean,

16

human biological products that are regulated under a

17

different section — in fact, a different act, the Public

18

Health Service Act.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Well, were they in it when it was

first enacted?
MR. MALLOY:

They were.

Veterinary biologies

22

were not, but human biologies were.

23

products were included in the 1984 statute as enacted.

There are 13

separate references in the committee reports regarding

Each and every one of them is drug in

The House report, in fact, specifically states

5
6

that the only activity exempted is drug testing activity.

7

In Medtronic's only quote from the legislative history, in

8

their only quote, they omit the very phrases in the

9

legislative history that specifically say the purpose is

10

to exempt drug testing.
I suggest Congress meant what it said.

11

Section

12

271(e)(1) is a narrow exemption.

It's a drug-only

13

statute, and it does not apply to infringing medical

14

devices such as Medtronic's product in suit.
The — the focus on the language which I've

15

16

talked about, development and submission, we've talked

17

about it applying to different sections of the Food, Drug

18

and Cosmetic Act.

19

Congress to have selected a less appropriate word than

20

drugs if it intended to include devices in light of the

21

fact that the statute already defines drugs as excluding

22

devices.

I think it would be difficult for

And it's unreasonable, I suggest, that Congress

In addition, other statutes also confirm and

In 1984 when Congress placed human drugs in the

In 1988 when the laws

10

were amended, Congress added animal drugs and veterinary

11

biological products to the exemption of (e)(1).

added them to the exemption to the patent owner protection

Indeed, the proposed Senate bill which sought

I suggest it's indisputable, even by Medtronic,

17

medical devices are not in Section (e)(2), and the reason

18

is simple:

19

20

Because Congress never put them in Section

In addition, the relationship of the patent

21

In sharp contrast, 271(e)(1) refers

only to drugs.

3

of these two statutes enacted at the same time in 1984

also confirms that 271(e)(1) is a drug-only statute.

And this disparate inclusion and exclusion

And it's no wonder that Section 271(e)(1) is

Section 156, the patent extension law, was in

MR. MALLOY:

Well, it's there, though.
Yes, it is.

And veterinary

biological products as well as animal drugs were both

added to the statute, and there are, I believe, Your

MR. MALLOY:

Here it was a medical device called

MR. MALLOY:

Yes, but what were they using it for?
They were using it — they were

it for its normal intended purpose to —

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that if it's — if

it's — if it was used solely -- in order to — not to be

reasonably related to the development of information that

had to be filed?

1

That's correct, Justice White, and

2

we would suggest that they aren't in the statute in any

3

event because their uses were so far beyond the solely for

4

clause.
QUESTION:

5

Well, that may be — that may be so,

6

but — but you — you -- the argument you're making that

7

even if it was for the purpose stated in this exemption

8

section, that would still be an infringement?
MR. MALLOY:

9

Let me see if I understand the

10

question.

What I am saying is that the statute doesn't

11

apply to medical devices.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MALLOY:

Right.
They are a medical device, and so

14

they're not -- no matter how narrowly they conform to the

15

FDA solely for — if they're doing nothing but testing for

16

FDA purposes, they're not within that exemption because

17

they are a medical device rather than a drug.

18

QUESTION:

I understand — I understand that.

19

But if they were using this device for the — for the

20

purpose that would give them an exemption, you still that

21

it's an infringement?

22

MR. MALLOY:

23
24
25

I — I'm not — I'm pausing because

I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
When you say for the purposes of the statute, I
say they can't use it for the purposes of the statute.

But maybe if I said — if the device were a drug and then

2

if they solely used that -- let's say if FDA had said this

3

device is a drug for whatever reason and then they limited

4

their uses to the -- solely to uses that were related to

5

submission and FDA information, then they would not any

6

longer be an infringement because (e)(1) says we're going

Section 271(a) is a very broad statute -

White's question prompted.
Are veterinary biological products regulated
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act?
MR. MALLOY:

They are not, Your Honor.

22

called the Virus, Serum and Toxin Act.

Congress was trying to correct that situation

and simultaneously correct the situation at the back end

of the patent, which required the next comer to the

So, you had a foreshortening of the patent at

That is correct.

To my understanding, Justice

Scalia, there is no gap.

The words work.

The problem with the petitioner's argument is

8

that you have to interpolate words that are not in the

You've somehow got to interpolate that patented

intermingled.

10

you want to talk about being easy, wouldn't that have been

11

a lot easier than this, which will pick up my -- my

hypothetical statute about missiles?

13

MR. MILLER:

Your hypothetical statute about

14

missiles can be handled exactly the way the Congress

handled the addition of animal drugs and veterinary

biological products in 1988.

people, you're going to get an extension, and an elaborate

scheme was established in 156 to give them the extension.

What Congress did in

That's it.

Congress quite clearly said there shall be no

That's what

Congress said you people -- and it

QUESTION:

May they test just during the

16

extension period or previously?

17

MR. MILLER:

No, Chief Justice.

The statute

18

allows the testing — and that's all it is, just testing

19

-- to occur during the patent period.

theoretically possible that somebody might start testing

21

in the first year, but won't be able to commercialize it

until 17 plus extension.

So it's

Now, it's important to understand that the

patent term is 17 years, the theoretical potential

25

extension is five years.

That's 22 years.
