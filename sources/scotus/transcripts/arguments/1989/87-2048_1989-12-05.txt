CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Fishbein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER M. FISHBEIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FISHBEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit below held Texaco liable for

11

violation of 2A of the Robinson-Patman Act for engaging in

12

an age-old practice, indeed one which is economically

13

necessary, of selling to wholesalers at a lower price than

14

it sold to retailers on the condition — on two

15

conditions:

16

One, that the wholesale discount was not

17

calibrated just to meet the wholesaler's cost of

18

wholesaling; and

19

Two, that the wholesaler, who was an independent

20

business entity, made an independent decision to pass some

21

of that discount on to its retailers; i.e., it sold its

22

retailers at a price that was different from Texaco's

23

direct sale to its retailers.

24
25

The plaintiffs who recovered damages for this
are 12 retail service stations in Spokane, Washington.

They were awarded treble damages during a period January

2

1972 through April 1981, based on Texaco's sales to

3

Dompier Oil Company, a wholesaler, at a higher price than

4

it sold directly to the Plaintiff retailers.
The record shows that Dompier purchased gasoline

5
6

from Texaco at the standard wholesale discount off the

7

retail tank wagon price that Texaco gave to all its

8

wholesalers in the Washington and Oregon territory.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Fishbein, how many wholesalers

were there in the territory?
MR. FISHBEIN:

11

Well, the record indicates that

12

there were two wholesalers in Spokane and a substantial

13

number throughout the states.

14

number, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

16

But does the record show there were

any others in the same competitive market?

17
18

I don't know the exact

MR. FISHBEIN:

There was a nonbranded wholesaler

in Spokane and one branded wholesaler.

MR. FISHBEIN:

of damages, sold only at wholesale.

During part of the

2

period and a later period it sold both at wholesale and at

3

retail.
Your Honor, the way the damages were advanced by

4
5

the plaintiffs here is they took four retail stations in

6

Spokane, and the damages were based exclusively on the

7

effect of the consumer sales from these four stations as

8

they affected the plaintiff stations.

9

Dompier-supplied stations.

Those four were all

The record is clear that during the beginning of

10
11

the damage period, from January 1972 through July '74,

12

each of those four stations was an independent retailer,

13

had no direct relationship with Dompier, and Dompier

14

bought and then made an independent price decision to sell

15

to those four retail stations.

16

independent price decision as to what price to charge the

17

consumer.

18

They, in turn, made an

So that for part of the damage period, Dompier

19

acted exclusively as a wholesaler and not a retailer, and

20

the only damages claimed by plaintiffs for that part of

21

the damage period were the sales from Dompier to these

22

four stations.

23

That is why the district court, in footnote 4 of

24

its opinion, specifically said prior to 1974 Dompier Oil

25

Company did not operate any retail stations but as a

distributor sold Texaco gasoline to retail stations.

Now, Your Honor —

3

QUESTION:

4

Would — would you concede liability

for the time when Dompier was acting as a retailer?
MR. FISHBEIN:

5

No, Your Honor.

The issue for

6

the time when Dompier was acting as a — both a wholesaler

7

and a retailer is an issue that's been much debated within

8

the Federal Trade Commission and the courts of appeals

9

which has been recently discussed in Judge Starr's opinion

10

in Boise Cascade.
It goes back to the FTC's opinions in Doubleday

11

12

and Mueller, and it's a question of when -- when an entity

13

is performing both functions, what kind of a discount or

14

what kind of a lower price can the supplier give?

15

have to cover only the retail functions?

16

give the wholesale discount for all sales even though some

17

of them are on retail?

18

debated in the lower courts and the Trade Commission now

19

which would have to be resolved as to the period

20

subsequent to 1974.

Does it

Can it -- can it

That's an issue that is being much

But that issue is not before this Court because

21
22

that wasn't addressed in the Ninth Circuit opinion.

23

would have to be an issue that the lower courts would have

24

to deal with on remand if the Ninth Circuit decision is

25

reversed.

That

The issue that the Ninth Circuit opinion

1
2

presents to this Court, because that's the way the case

3

was tried and that's the way the record that clearly is

4

the part of the damage period is directly assailed to an

5

entity Dompier is exclusively a wholesaler and makes an

6

independent decision to sell to its retailers at a certain

7

price.

8

issue we suggest the Ninth Circuit departed from logic and

9

economics and precedent when it said that alone is

10

sufficient to create a liability under Section 2A.

11

That is the issue before the Court, and that's the

QUESTION:

Mr. Fishbein, I think I understand

12

that the jury was given an instruction at trial, number

13

20, which told the jury that it could infer the likelihood

14

of injury to competition from evidence that Texaco had

15

discriminated in price in the sale of gasoline between

16

different purchasers who were in competition with each

17

other and that the price difference was substantial and it

18

lasted for a substantial period of time, the so-called

19

Morton Salt type instruction.

20

MR. FISHBEIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

Yes.

You may — your client did not object

to that instruction, I take it?

23

MR. FISHBEIN:

24

standard Morton Salt instruction.

25

<

That's correct.

That's the

What my client did object to, Your Honor, was

1

instruction 23(A) which converted the Morton Salt

2

inference as it was enunciated by this Court in Morton

3

Salt into a very different inference because instruction

4

23(A) told the jury that Dompier, in effect, would be in

5

competition with the plaintiffs if any of Dompier's

6

customers were in competition with the plaintiffs.

7

So when you take instruction 20 and 23(A)

8

together, what the jury was instructed is that the

9

discriminatory price, the price difference between Dompier

10

as a wholesaler and the plaintiffs as a retailer itself

11

and alone would justify the Morton Salt inference because

12

Dompier's customers, not Dompier, was in competition with

13

the plaintiffs.

14

Now it's our position — and, of course, the

15

Ninth Circuit dealt with the Morton Salt inference rather

16

extensively in its opinion, and it's our position, Your

17

Honor, that that is a misapplication of the Morton Salt

18

inference.

19

In effect, what that does is convert a

20

traditional time-honored, economically required policy of

21

selling to a wholesaler at a lower price than a retailer

22

into an automatic inference that that in itself effects

23

competition at the retail level, whereas Morton Salt, of

24

course, was a sale by a seller to two competing buyers who

25

were competing with each other.

Now it's one thing to say that it's self-evident

1
2

that if over a substantial period of time a seller is

3

selling to two competing buyers at substantially different

4

prices that that is going to affect the competition

5

between them.

6

did in this case, and as the jury instructions required

7

the jury to do, to say that when a wholesaler — when a

8

retailer, a supplier sells to a wholesaler at one price

9

and a retailer at a lower price, that that in itself said

It's wholly different, as the Ninth Circuit

10

that it self-evidently is going to affect competition

11

between the wholesalers, retailers and the direct buying

12

retail.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Fishbein, the Robinson-Patman Act

14

does prohibit discrimination in price between different

15

purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality.

16
17

Now what was it about this case that prevented
that language from applying to your client?

MR. FISHBEIN:

There are two parts of the

19

Robinson-Patman Act language that don't apply in this

20

instance, Your Honor.

21

to people at different levels of the distribution chain,

25

that is not a discrimination within the meaning of the

Robinson-Patman Act.

2

Our second argument —

3

QUESTION:

Well, you — you think there's — is

4

there something then invidious in the notion that the word

5

"discriminate" conveys?

6

"discriminate" means to differentiate.

7

Certainly, ordinarily

Your Honor, in an oft-quoted statement by

8

Representative Utterbach, who was the conference sponsor

9

of the Robinson-Patman Act, he pointed out that

10

discrimination means a difference or a differentiation

11

only in those circumstances where the two people being

12

differentiated have some reason or some justification to

13

be treated the same.

14

mean a discrimination.

15

use of discrimination seems to us to mean something more

16

than just a difference.

17

circumstance where you would expect or require equal

18

treatment.

Any difference doesn't automatically

It means a difference in a

Now that's certainly true when you have a

20

supplier selling to two buyers who are at the same level

21

in competing with each other.

22

not true where you have a supplier selling on one hand to

23

a wholesaler, on the other hand to a retailer who are at

24

two different levels.

discrimination?

Utterbach's comment for 50 years, but what — what's the

4

principal judicial decision that says a mere price

difference is not a discrimination?

I know that everybody's heard Congressman

MR. FISHBEIN:

6

Well, Justice Stevens, I'm sure

7

that you're aware, the principal authority you're dealing

8

with at this point is this Court's opinion in

9

Anheuser-Busch, which is its opinion by Justice Warren

10

quite some time ago which has discouraged lower courts

11

from applying this literally.

12

It's our position in this case that

13

Anheuser-Busch, while it has language in it that says a

14

difference is a discrimination, is totally distinguishable

15

from this case and shouldn't be applied —

distinguish all or most of these cases, but I was just

wondering.

Under the

MR. FISHBEIN:

QUESTION:

MR. FISHBEIN:

4

QUESTION:

Where it would be violated?

Yeah.
At the second level?

Where you have substantial price

5

difference between the prices charged to a wholesaler and

6

a retailer, could that ever adversely affect competition

7

between the two customers or customers of either — either

8

of them?

9

MR. FISHBEIN:

Well, Your Honor, it is our

10

position that where you — where you have a difference in

11

price it's not between people of the same level, two

12

wholesalers or two retailers, but if people in different

13

distribution levels --

QUESTION:

You say if they're

15

different — different functional levels, it never

16

violates the statute?

17

MR. FISHBEIN:

QUESTION:

19
20

It does not violate the standard.

What if there was an agreement, pass-

on agreement?
MR. FISHBEIN:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

If there

21

was a sham or a pass-on agreement or a supplier set up a

22

wholesaler and required him to pass on or it was a phony

situation where he was using that to pass on —

2

given?
MR. FISHBEIN:

I think, Your Honor, that there

3

are two answers to that.

4

an issue in this case based on the Ninth Circuit's opinion

5

and — and the instructions below.

6

First of all, knowledge is not

Beyond that, it's our position that knowledge is

7

irrelevant to this issue and is not of material fact

8

because knowledge doesn't add anything.

9

at the two levels is not a discrimination, then knowledge

If the difference

10

is irrelevant, and if it is the independent decision of

11

the wholesaler that causes the effect on competition,

12

knowledge that the wholesaler is going to do that on

13

behalf of the supplier is also irrelevant.

14

Another way to answer that question, Your Honor,

15

is to ask, what could the supplier do if it has a dual

16

channel distribution system and it is selling to a

17

wholesaler at a price that presumably covers his cost and

18

provides for a profit and that wholesaler is aggressive

19

and either is taking lower margins than other wholesalers

20

or is willing for a period of time to try to expand its

21

business and is selling by passing on the discount.

22

Given the facts like this situation, where the

23

wholesaler is an independent entity and the supplier is

24

not engaging in vertical price maintenance and the

25

wholesaler has the right to make those decisions,

1

knowledge doesn't help the supplier at all.

2

nothing the supplier can do to prevent that other than to

cut out the wholesalers or cut out the retailers, which is

4

not what this statute is designed to bring about.

QUESTION:

There's

I suppose you could also say there's

an independent retailer?
MR. FISHBEIN:

Well, there might be.

I mean, I

don't know that it's relevant to this.
QUESTION:

No, but an independent retailer might

not pass it on.
MR. FISHBEIN:

Yes, that's right.

That is

exactly right, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

He might prefer a profit.

14

MR. FISHBEIN:

Yes.

When a supplier sells to a

15

wholesaler, it sets that — that price presumably based on

16

what it has to pay in a competitive market to get the

17

wholesaler to do the work, plus it has to add enough on so

18

the wholesaler will have a profit which will encourage the

19

wholesaler to carry out those functions.

20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Fishbein, how do we know who's a

wholesaler and who's a retailer?

MR. FISHBEIN:

QUESTION:

And — and if we had that subsequent

situation in front of us, how do you distinguish?

8

your rule couldn't apply.

9

MR. FISHBEIN:

No.

I mean,

That is what the D.C.

10

Circuit has been grappling with in Boise Cascade, that one

11

has to separate out the wholesale and the retail functions

12

and make a determination as to what kind of price

13

discounts can be given overall for each one.

14

But that is clearly not our case in the period

15

through the middle of 1974, and since the plaintiffs'

16

damage evidence consisted of a single damage number for

17

each plaintiff through the entire period, and there was no

18

evidence presented or no way the jury or anybody else

19

could break out the damage during various subsets of this

20

period, necessarily part of the damages that the jury

21

found was for this period from January 1972 through July

22

of 1974, and necessarily that depended on a legal

23

conclusion that it was a violation of the act for Texaco

24

to sell to Dompier exclusively as a wholesaler.

MR. DREEBEN:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit ruled that a supplier's use of

12

13

a functional discount constitutes price discrimination

14

when the wholesaler passes on a portion of the discount to

15

retailers.

16

discount is cost based, and the retailers who buy from the

17

wholesaler compete with other retailers who buy directly

18

from the supplier.

The supplier cannot show that the functional

MR. DREEBEN:

2

Yes, Your Honor.

The

3

interpretation of the language of the Robinson-Patman Act

4

that's in question here is Section 2(a), which, as you

5

read, provides that it's unlawful for a person engaged in

6

commerce to discriminate in price where the effect of such

7

discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition

8

and to cause the competitive effects described in the

9

statute.
We believe that the -- the word and the language

10
11

of the statute that should be interpreted here are the

12

effect language.

13

between a wholesaler and a retailer in a legitimate

14

functional discount causes the requisite anticompetitive

15

effect described in the statute.

16

The question is whether a discrimination

The Federal Trade Commission believes that it

17

does not because the primary purpose of a functional

18

discount is to shift distribution functions from a

19

supplier to a middleman who assists in getting the goods

20

to market.

21

The interpretation of the language effect is

that -- is the identical interpretation given by the 1955

report of the Attorney General's national committee to

There are two reasons primarily --

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. DREEBEN:

I believe that if the combination

of jury instructions 18 and 23(A) would permit the

imposition of liability on Dompier for the time when he

sold to retailers even when the discount that he received

5

which occasioned the price discrimination was, in our

view, a legitimate functional discount, and since the jury

7

wasn't told to exclude that portion of damages, to that

extent the judgment is infirm.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, at the petition stage, I

thought the brief of the Solicitor General said they

QUESTION:

I would appreciate it if you would.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

At the petition stage, the

20

question was whether this Court's review was warranted,

21

and we believed that the ultimate importance of the issue

22

that is raised by Petitioner to the judgment in this case

23

is somewhat minor because the damages period ran from 1972

24

to 1981, and the portion of that period during which we

believe Dompier's discount was lawful was only a very

early part of the period.
Notwithstanding that, the jury was not given any

3

way to break out the lawful period from the unlawful

period, and thus, we believe on remand, the court of

5

appeals might conclude that the entire period is tainted.

6

This Court might also reach that judgment.

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, they would matter.

They

3

would bear, Your Honor, on the question of whether the

4

discount was indeed a legitimate functional discount.

5

think that in addition to a requirement that the

6

wholesaler and the retailer not compete, there is also a

7

requirement that the wholesaler have to be performing some

8

functions that are characteristic of a wholesaler, such as

9

distributing the product, absorbing credit risks, actually

10

searching out customers to sell to on resale, and that

11

that inquiry is a qualitative kind of judgment that is

12

made, could be made by a court in the summary judgment

13

context and would not be difficult to administer.

14

But once it's determined that in fact a

15

wholesaler is receiving a functional discount, we don't

believe that there should be a further inquiry that

requires the supplier to justify that discount based on

It's not quite the same as — as

the case that this Court confronted in Falls City v.

13

Vanco, where there, in fact, were two different prices

given to people at the same functional level.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

We're relying on an interpretation

2

of the language that would construe it in light of

3

Congress' purposes, which is pretty much the way this

4

Court has handled a number of Robinson-Patman issues in

5

the past.

6

to be somewhat inexact, and in order to give effect to

7

what Congress intended, the Court has — has taken a close

8

look at the precise types of pricing arrangements.

9

The language of the statute has been recognized

Now a discount to a wholesaler being exactly

10

what Congress wanted to foster and preserve multi-layered

11

distribution systems, it seems to me that it would be

12

inconsistent with that intent to then give effect the kind

13

of reading that was given to it by the court of appeals.

14

QUESTION:

Maybe — maybe Congress only wanted

15

to foster such discounts to the extent that the discounts

16

take into account the function that the distribution

17

system performs, which means to the extent that they're

18

properly price based.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, to the extent that Congress

20

took a look at that issue, it did not prescribe any kind

21

of a test that would be workable.

So to the extent that the wholesaler decides to

become price aggressive or more efficient in — in

11

performing his distribution function, the Ninth Circuit

12

would require that the wholesale discount be contracted,

and then you would have wholesale discounts that varied

By the — the statutory defense

that if — if a discount takes into account the seller's

cost, then it's cost-justified.

9
10

They were unable to do that.
They were unable to show their competitors

11

required them to do it, that they were meeting the

competitive offer of Exxon or Shell or someone else.

competition; that is, the economic viability of thousands

of stations were admittedly affected by this.

Given that posture, it is — it seems to me

beyond dispute that a court could not say that you would

In this case, Texaco is submitting to the Court

that it has come up with a device that will work; and that

is, it can favor large retail purchasers by calling the

rule the Ninth Circuit laid down, or seemed to be laying

down, was that one of the important elements of the issue

was whether or not the discount was justified by the costs

The Texaco wholesalers who were the ones that
