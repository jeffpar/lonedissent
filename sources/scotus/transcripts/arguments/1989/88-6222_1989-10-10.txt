ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. GETTLEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. GETTLEMAN:

9

Thank you, Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The issue before the Court in this case is does the

10
11

mandatory language in the Pennsylvania death sentence -- death

12

penalty statute, prevent a sentencer from making an

13

independent determination as to whether death's a appropriate

14

sentence in a given case.

15

majority opinion written by Justice Connor, she approved a

16

far-reaching inquiry into the countless facts and

17

circumstances by a sentencing jury, and she indicated in that

18

opinion that once an individual defendant becomes death

19

eligible, then the jury can take into consideration a myriad

20

of facts and circumstances which might warrant a sentence of

21

less than death.

22

In Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania legislature has

In California v. Ramos, in a

unconstitutionally, in my opinion, limited the types of

,

mitigation that a jury can consider in determining whether or
not there is mitigation.

For instance, Pennsylvania only

allows a jury to consider extreme mental illness or

2

substantial impairment.

3

Blystone gave an extended confession to a police informant,

4

and in that confession he alluded to things like, well, it was

5

thrilling to kill somebody, and you really don't have to be a

6

bad person to kill, and alluded to aspects of the person's

7

brain coming out of his head.

8

9

But in this particular case, Mr.

Now, a juror who heard all this might think that this
individual is mentally ill to think like that, to have no

10

regard at all for life, but might feel that under the

11

definition of Pennsylvania's extreme mental illness, or

12

substantial impairment, it wouldn't qualify, because he might

13

feel extreme would be locked up in a mental institution or

14

taking thorazine.

15

to consider mental illness or substantial impairment in making

16

a decision as to whether or not death is the appropriate

17

sentence.

18

And what happens is that he is not allowed

The Respondent had suggested that in the catchall,

19

number 8, the jury could then consider whether or not an

20

individual is simply mentally impaired or simply mentally ill.

21

But I think that — that analysis is incorrect for this

22

reason.

23

they included a burden of proof, proof beyond a — proof

24

beyond a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a

mitigating factor.

Proof by a preponderance of

the evidence that an individual was severely mentally ill or

extremely mentally ill.

If it could be picked up in this

the jury would no longer have to find it by a preponderance of

14

probably mean other than the first seven factors.

15

defendant in Pennsylvania would probably be left -- a

16

defendant in Pennsylvania who is just simply mentally ill, or

17

whose judgment was just substantially impaired, would be left

18

with a situation where the jury could not consider that, or

19

give any weight to it, in making a determination as to whether

or not death is the appropriate —

extremely mentally ill, or severely emotionally impaired, he

would set that aside, or she would set that aside, and go on

down the list to see if it fit in any other category.

would suggest to Justice O'Connor that when the got down to

instructed probably wouldn't retrieve it back and conclude --

Now, if a jury, in viewing all the

Don't you think that an attorney would argue

10

on the basis of all of the mitigating evidence that came in,

11

including whatever degree of mental impairment there might be?

12

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Well, it is for a jury to give whatever

13

weight they consider to any particular factor, and it could

14

well be that amongst the 12 they might consider something that

15

would be mitigating which an attorney wouldn't have brought

up.

just apply it like that.

suggested that a juror should be allowed to weigh whatever is

QUESTION:

Mr. Gettleman, I have some difficulty

6

understanding how this argument relates to the question we

7

granted certiorari to decide.

8

MR. GETTLEMAN:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

Is whether the mandatory feature of the

10

statute requires death when there is one aggravating

11

circumstance and no mitigating circumstance is valid.

12

MR. GETTLEMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

It does —

And so we are assuming for purpose of

decision there are no mitigating circumstances.

15

MR. GETTLEMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Right.

(Inaudible) your question.
But the argument suggests that because

18

of the limiting nature or the limitations that Pennsylvania

19

puts on the mitigating circumstances, that's the reason why

20

there were no mitigating circumstances in this particular —

21

QUESTION:

Well, that may be true, but I don't see how

22

that is relevant to the question you presented in your

23

certiorari petition.

24
25

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Okay, well then, let me just go right

to that, then.

1

In Pennsylvania the situation is that if there is one

2

aggravating and no mitigating circumstances, then the jury is

3

instructed that they must return with the verdict of death.

4

In that particular case there is no weighing, as had just been

5

suggested in the last argument, in North Carolina, as to the

6

strength of the aggravating circumstance.

7

opinion that you co-authored in Barclay, you had suggested

8

that if the aggravating circumstances outweighed the

9

mitigating, but weren't so weighty as to require death, then

I think, in an

10

the jury should be permitted to return with the verdict of

11

life, because it wouldn't have been the appropriate sentence.

12

Also, in North Carolina v. Smith, you had suggested

13

again that there is almost a constitutional right for a jury

14

to exercise its discretion and return with a verdict of life,

15

even though there might be more aggravating than mitigating,

16

when the strength of the aggravating is not such that would

17

require the death sentence.

18

In Pennsylvania, what happens is that if there are no

19

mitigating circumstances, the jury is instructed that they

20

must return with the verdict of death.

21

no discretion at all.

22

They have absolutely

And it seems to me that this falls under the same

23

problem as Caldwell v. Mississippi.

told that it's really not ultimately up to you to decide

25

whether the person is going to die.

In that case the jury was

In Pennsylvania, what they

based on the idea that the — there were — wrong statements

Here, it seems to me, that when the

but I don't think it makes it a Caldwell case.

14

MR. GETTLEMAN:

You say that is wrong,

Well, only to suggest that in Caldwell

this Court spoke about the -- the awesome responsibility it —
is upon a jury when they decide whether or not to take

15

somebody's life.

16

somewhat delegated by suggesting that it -- the — that the

17

Supreme Court could review that.

18

analogy would be that some of the responsibility for the jury,

19

in deciding whether somebody should live or die, is being

20

taken away from them when they are told that it's really not

21

up to you.

22

you must return with the verdict of death.

And the fact that that responsibility is

life or death.

2

MR. GETTLEMAN:

I do.

I think that the Eighth

3

Amendment would suggest that there is a certain reliability-

4

necessary to make a determination as to whether death is an

5

appropriate sentence.
QUESTION:

6
7

Well, what has this got to do with

reliability?

8

9

In Pennsylvania --

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Well, reliability in the — in the

respect that a jury really doesn't get to consider whether

10

there is an -- just because there is an aggravating

11

circumstance, that death is an appropriate sentence.

12

not a situation like had been suggested in the North Carolina

13

legislature, where even though mitigating circumstance --

14

excuse me, even though aggravating circumstances are found and

15

no mitigating circumstances are found, the jury still makes an

16

independent determination as to whether the strength of that

17

aggravation is enough to warrant a sentence of death.
QUESTION:

18

It is

But -- but I -- I know Pennsylvania is

19

different from North Carolina.

20

considered all the mitigating evidence, I guess by hypothesis,

21

and found that no mitigating circumstance exists.

22

MR. GETTLEMAN:

But here the jury has

Well, I would only like to suggest, and

23

what I was trying to suggest to Justice Stevens, is simply

24

this.

25

types of mitigation that can be considered —

It is our position also that Pennsylvania limits the

3

QUESTION:

But that really isn't your question

presented, is it?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

Well, only in the respect that you had

4

suggested to me Pennsylvania had already found that there was

5

no -- there was no mitigation.

6

that they found that there was no mitigation is because they

7

were limited by the statute in finding that mitigation to

8

engage in a weighing process.

9

weighing process at all.

But I am suggesting the reason

In Pennsylvania there is no

It could be the most minimal of

10

felony murders, and a defendant would be sentenced to death if

11

the jury didn't find any aggravating circumstances beyond a

12

reasonable doubt.

13

So what I am suggesting is that --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Any mitigating circumstances.
If they didn't find any mitigating

16

circumstances that outweighed aggravating circumstances, the

17

verdict would have to be death.

18

mitigating circumstances at all, then the verdict would have

19

to be death.

Justice Blackmun was saying about the dangers of having a

mandatory sentence.

23

a mitigating circumstance.

1

killing of a police officer in the line of duty is an

2

aggravating circumstance, you think the Constitution requires

3

a system in which the jury can find no mitigating

4

circumstances, and then say well, really I don't think killing

5

a police officer is a crime that deserves the death penalty.

6

You, constitutionally, you say that that is constitutionally

7

required, that the jury has that authority.

8
9

MR. GETTLEMAN:

I think it is constitutionally required

that the jury can weigh an aggravating circumstance to make a

10

determination —

11

QUESTION:

Well, what about the case that I put?

They

12

find no mitigating circumstances, but some jurors think well,

13

killing a police officer in the line of duty is really not the

14

kind of thing that we should impose the death penalty for.

15

You think the Constitution requires that the jury have that

16

kind of authority to second-guess the legislature?

17

MR. GETTLEMAN:

I think the Constitution would require

18

that the jury could look to that single circumstance to make a

19

determination as to whether or not that was strong enough, or

20

the facts that went into killing the police officer were such

21

22
,23

QUESTION:

Well, the facts are all mitigating

circumstances under Section 8 of the Pennsylvania code.

I

am

asking you, in my case, whether the jury could say that in

their view killing a police officer, as an abstract matter -12

MR. GETTLEMAN:

calls for the death penalty.

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Yes.

All right. . That is your position.

It seems

to me that that is exactly contrary to what we required in

Furman v. Georgia.

And it seems to me then, then we have gone

MR. GETTLEMAN:

9

Well, I would only suggest, Justice

10

Kennedy, that different legislatures around the country have

11

addressed that very issue.

12

Florida has, Arkansas has, Nebraska has, and they all suggest

13

that even when an aggravating circumstance is found, that the

14

jury should still make a determination as to whether or not

15

that aggravating circumstance is substantial enough to warrant

16

death.

17

Obviously, North Carolina has,

I had suggested, when I — when I was addressing

18

Justice Stevens, that he had also suggested in certain cases

19

that even though you find an aggravating circumstance, and he

20

didn't identify that as either killing a police officer or any

21

other of the enumerated circumstances, but he did suggest that

22

there are cases where you do have aggravating circumstances

23

and no mitigating circumstances, but the aggravating

24

circumstances in and of themselves aren't so weighty, or

25

aren't so substantial that would require death sentencing.

you do have —

circumstance.

was no evidence necessarily as to what the facts were of the

aggravating circumstances.

Because, in the opinion that he authored, there

All I am suggesting is — what was suggested in that
opinion, is you can have a situation where you do have an

10

aggravating circumstance, you don't have any -- excuse me, you

11

don't have any mitigating circumstances, but the jury makes an

12

independent determination that the aggravating circumstances

13

wasn't substantial enough to warrant the death sentence.

14

that is the only thing I was suggesting by that answer.

15
16

QUESTION:

What was the aggravating circumstance in

this case?

MR. GETTLEMAN:

It was

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Murder — first degree murder in the

course of committing a felony.

guilty of the crime they in effect had already proven

aggravating circumstances.

6

prosecutor closed to the jury in his -- in the sentencing

7

phase, he had indicated to them that we have already

8

established that a felony murder has been committed, and then

9

he spoke about their duty to return a verdict of death.

10

QUESTION:

When they found Mr. Blystone

As a matter of fact, when the

Well, they clearly here, as I understand the

11

statute, clearly had to -- assuming they didn't find

12

mitigating circumstances, the fact that the defendant, rather

13

than one of the other occupants of the car, stole the $13 from

14

the victim is what not only authorized the death penalty, but

15

actually mandated it.

16

taken the $13, there could not have been a death penalty in

17

this case, is that right?

18

MR. GETTLEMAN:

If there had been no -- if he had not

No, I think that if he was found guilty

of -- well, maybe under Enmund he couldn't, but in

20

Pennsylvania — if he had been found guilty of first degree

21

murder, as an accomplice --

22

QUESTION:

Assume he didn't -- if somebody didn't even

5

MR. GETTLEMAN:

6

QUESTION:

No, probably not.

So, not only probably not, the aggravating

7

circumstance that authorized and also required the death

penalty in this case was the fact that he was found guilty of

9

the $13 robbery.

10

MR. GETTLEMAN:

11

QUESTION:

Correct.

And all the other facts are irrelevant to

12

the -- all the other aggravating circumstances are irrelevant

13

to the death — to the penalty determination.

14
15
16

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Right, to the penalty determination,

that's correct.
I only suggest that the courts have indicated that

17

there is a constitutional requirement that before a sentence

18

of death may be imposed, it is the sentencer that must decide

19

whether death is an appropriate sentence.

20

case the sentencer is precluded from making the determination

21

that death is an appropriate sentence in this case.

22

aggravating circumstance is found and no mitigation is found,

23

then he has no say in it.

24

process that the Court suggested was inappropriate.

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Well, what I would like to suggest is

that in the Furman case the reason that they spoke about

The important fact that I think also has to be

remembered here in considering Pennsylvania's statute, and

Petitioner makes the argument that the jury is precluded from

considering certain kinds of mitigating evidence because the

what makes Pennsylvania's statute a solid statute, that —

that well balances the competing interests here that the

Eighth Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment requires of

the states.

14

The Commonwealth is, in this particular case, has

presented a statute to this Court for consideration that we do

believe well balances those competing interests.

is — it fairly balances it, too.

MR. PREATE:

required under this statute, Justice Blackmun, required in

And those reviews take considerable amount of time.

think it is important that our Supreme Court gives

consideration to these cases so carefully.

is a verdict that is not based on passion or prejudice, or

some other arbitrary factor.

It requires the

Of course there are those,

I think Mr.

8

Justice Powell among others, who have said if you are going to

have a death penalty you ought to enforce it.

You have on

room.

12

MR. PREATE:

13

agree with that argument.

14

in my duty as the Attorney General of the state, would be to

see that the laws are fairly enforced, and to ensure that

every consideration is given to the defendant before the power

of the state, the vast power of the state, is -- is caused to

And so I support our Supreme Court in its careful

review, and I support the process of appellate review.

21

think it is important, too, that our Supreme Court looks at

the aggravating circumstance, it's forced to look at the

23

aggravating circumstances written down on the jury verdict.

MR. PREATE:

When did this crime take place?
This crime took place in 1983.

compared to a lot of other cases that are pending across the

9

country.

MR. PREATE:

That — that is correct, Your Honor.

11

And finally, under Pennsylvania's statute, a

12

comparative proportionality review takes place.

13

that the Pennsylvania statute has tried, the legislature has

14

tried, given the exit -- given its sovereignty under the

15

Constitution, to take the kind of guidance that this Court

over the years has set — set forth that should be taken.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. GETTLEMAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. GETTLEMAN:

My rebuttal will be very brief, Judge -

5

- Mr. Chief Justice, and it would only be in response to just

6

a couple of points that the Respondent made.

7

The Respondent seems to suggest that it is all right

8

for the jury to weigh the strength of the aggravation, but the

9

way it is done is it comes in through the catchall mitigating

10

situation.

11

In this particular case, before the trial judge charged

12

the jury, he said to them that he was going to list everything

13

that they could consider as mitigation.

14

the list and he suggested all the factors, the seven specific

15

factors and the one catchall factor.

16

way of knowing that if they found a specific aggravating

17

circumstance, a felony murder by proof beyond a reasonable

18

doubt, that they could then turn around and weigh that as a

19

mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence

20

under the mitigation.

21

And then he went down

But a jury would have no

There is no instruction whatsoever, and there is no way

22

a jury could even have intuitively known that it was

23

permissible for them to flip-flop on a particular aggravating

24

circumstance, turn it into a mitigating circumstance, create a

25

straw man and weigh the two against each other, and then come

1

up with a — a determination as -- as to whether an

2

aggravating circumstance outweighed itself, or whether a

3

mitigating circumstance outweighed itself.

4

Another thing that the Commonwealth had, or the

5

Respondent had suggested, that it's all right for a jury in

6

Pennsylvania to consider just mental illness or substantial

7

impairment, that that can be considered under the catchall

8

phrase.

9

the Court spoke about mere sympathy, well, you can't take out

But, in a similar vein as California v. Brown, when

10

that word mere, and in Pennsylvania you can't take out the

11

word other, as in other factors.

12

other than the first seven.

13

listen to its instructions felt that the -- the severity of

14

the illness wasn't extreme or wasn't substantial, then they

15

would be precluded from what this Court has suggested that

16

they have every right to do, in Lockett and Jurek and those

17

other cases, is to consider any mitigating evidence and give

18

it the weight that it believes it deserves in arriving at the

19

formula as to whether one outweighs the other.

20

And other factors would be

And if a jury who was going to

And in conclusion, I think this Court has alluded to,

21

and has specifically said through Justice Stevens, that there

22

is a constitutional right to have the defendant — have the

23

jury weigh the weight or the strength of the aggravating

24

circumstance, even if it is weighed against itself, to make a

25

determination that that's the type and the strength of the

kind of circumstance that would justify a death sentence as
