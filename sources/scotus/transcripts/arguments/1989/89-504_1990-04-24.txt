be a contempt of the district court's findings.

suggesting a much broader

ability of

the

Secretary to obtain review of a decision in favor of the
claimant than the Secretary believes he has under the Act.
Moreover,

I think it clearly is in the interest

of claimants to allow an appeal at this stage because if
the court of appeals agrees with the district court and
upholds the district court's decision that will establish
the law of the circuit.

And the Secretary's acquiescence

policy will then be that either the Secretary will seek
further review in this Court or will acquiesce in the Third
Circuit's decision and all future decisions will be governed
by that holding.
Thank you.
