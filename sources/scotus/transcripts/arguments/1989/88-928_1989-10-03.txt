CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument next

in No. 88-928, James M. White versus the United States.
We'll wait, just a minute, Mr. Payment, until the
Court clears.
Very well, Mr. Payment, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH A. PAYMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. PAYMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This is a case about federalism and the right of the

13

Internal Revenue Service to second-guess the determination of

14

state trial courts, as has been held by the court below, the

15

Second Circuit.

16

The case grew out of a recent campaign by the

17

Internal Revenue Service of disallowing the estate tax

18

deductions for attorney's fees on estate tax returns.

19

campaign, over the recent years, has consisted of collateral

20

attacks as to state probate decrees.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Payment, has this so-called attack

22

occurred only in one area of the country, or is this a

23

nationwide effort?

24
25

This

MR. PAYMENT:

It started in the western district of

New York; it has spread to other parts of New York and

apparently could be expected to spread nationwide, depending

MR. PAYMENT:

QUESTION:

But, thus far, just in New York?

What is there, an -- an ambitious revenue

agent up there, who wants to make a quota or. something?

MR. PAYMENT:

QUESTION:

10

That — that is true.

So it would seem, Your Honor.

In competition with the income tax

people, who would pick it up on the other side of the coin?
MR. PAYMENT:

I — that is our position, indeed,

11

that as the Second Circuit mentioned, one would well wonder

12

why the Internal Revenue Service would deploy its forces in

13

this manner.

14

But, in any event, these attacks have persisted, and

15

they have been made notwithstanding that orders of — of the

16

probate courts have become final and binding on the estate,

not attorney's fee issues, that you would see a lot of cases,

2

even after the Bosch case.

3

These attacks are made notwithstanding --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Payment, when you — you use the term

5

"collateral attack," that isn't strictly correct, is it?

6

Because the government wasn't a party to the case in which the

7

attorney's fees were — were — were allowed.
MR. PAYMENT:

8
9

As a matter of fact, the government

does nothave to appear in such cases, and, as a

10

policy, never does appear.

11

in the state court proceeding --

12

QUESTION:

But it could have chosen to appear

Well, I think of a collateral attack as

13

being a challenge to a

14

bound by

15

matter of

final judgment by someone who -- who is

the judgment,by someone who is a party to it.
MR. PAYMENT:

I understand there is a difference,

16

Your Honor, but — and — and of course, we do not assert res

17

judicata principles apply here.

18

But what's happening is that the dispute is moving

19

out of the state court into the federal courts.

20

a determination that is binding on all the parties to the

21

estate, who, in most cases, have already consented to the

22

result, the surrogate court or the probate court has made an

23

order, it's final, the amount that has been assessed is —

24

routine and the fact is that the amount has been paid, and the

25

beneficiaries of the estate are stuck with the result.

Well, I guess this comes up in the

MR. PAYMENT:

That's correct, it does come up in

that context.

6

QUESTION:

Which complicates it somewhat, because

7

the Court has been careful not to trench upon the summons

enforcement power of the IRS.

9
10

MR. PAYMENT:

That is very true.

You had two cases

in the last year.

QUESTION:

MR. PAYMENT:

That's right.
And there -- have had many in the last

13

24 or 5 years since the Powell case, and the government almost

But I think you

So, presumably, the IRS could

legitimately seek information by -- by way of the summons

enforcement technique?

Well, that depends on whether our

position is correct or not on Bosch and on 2053.

us that Bosch was perhaps -- went too far, or we need to cut

2

back on it or something?

3

MR. PAYMENT:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. PAYMENT:

Well --

For you to win?
First of all, we're dealing with a

6

different statute than was involved in the Bosch case.

So

7

we're not seeking to overrule or really touch upon Bosch.

8

we have commented and alerted the court to the fact, at least

9

through one law review article that summarizes this very well,

10

that the decisions since Bosch have been all over the lot;

11

that the federal courts have had a very difficult time in

12

dealing with a proper purpose test, and simply haven't been

13

able to consistently apply it.

14

But

You have cases in which proper purpose is read to

15

mean — or rather, excuse me -- the concept of proper regard

16

is read to mean no regard.

17

180 degrees the other way and give preclusive effect to the

18

determination of the state court.

21

QUESTION:

You have cases in which — that go

You don't rely on any argument that the

IRS has acted in bad faith, I gather?
MR. PAYMENT:

In — in the sense that if you do not

22

have a proper purpose for a summons enforcement proceeding,

23

that is bad faith.

24

Because, if we are right about our construction of 2053 and of

25

the Bosch case, that means that the state court's

That is the antithesis of good faith.

determination is preclusive.

It should end the inquiry.

2

if it ends the inquiry, then you can't have a proper purpose.

3

And if they come into court —

QUESTION:

What if there were fraud or the state

The government has made much of the district court's

Because I

1

— I have some trouble with this argument, because in lots of

2

tax enforcement, the Internal Revenue doesn't have any

3

suspicion of fraud, but they'll just make random — take one

4

out of every 100 returns and -- and investigate them very

5

thoroughly, and sometimes they'll stumble on fraud.

6

MR. PAYMENT:

7

QUESTION:

I understand.

Could they do this in the attorney fee

8

area — just not necessarily have to allege fraud, but just

9

say as our routine enforcement, we check up on every 15th fee

— fee award?
MR. PAYMENT:

11

Let's say that were the case, not —

12

not what is actually happening, but that — hypothetical were

13

the case.

14

instance, the decree is binding, you can see that there ought

15

to be something more in this kind of a case, because it's so

16

different.

17

The fact of the matter is that if, as a first

In the Powell setting and almost every other setting

18

that this Court has ever dealt with, you have an individual

19

tax payer who has an ability to hide the records, who has an

20

21

QUESTION:

is it's — it's not all that burdensome to turn over your time

MR. PAYMENT:

they were important.

He would have had no

But the New York Court of Appeals, as we have made

10

very clear, has listed nine factors that the courts look to.

11

And those nine factors are largely subjective.

12

time required for the project, they are very subjective

13

factors, and local custom, local practice is an appropriate

consideration under the Freeman case, and so the Freeman case

disallowed the entire fee, paid a deficiency, and has brought

a companion action, a refund action in the federal district

MR. PAYMENT:

I'm sure that that was their position.

3

The subpoena — the summons had not been obeyed, and

therefore, as sort of a punitive measure, the entire deduction

was disallowed.

QUESTION:

Well, supposing you had findings by the

trial judge that this was a complicated estate, and I know

17

from similar complicated estates it takes a great deal of time

and effort, and I think it's an awful lot of money, but in

this particular case, it's perfectly reasonable to give them

20

90 percent of the estate?

21

MR. PAYMENT:

If you have that kind of a finding,

22

QUESTION:

MR. PAYMENT:

No they don't.
The Internal Revenue Service's

position is they're entitled to jury trials in such cases,

they're entitled to drag the surrogate in, I guess, and have

1

I

I don't think that

there should be a loss in a case like that, but I don't think

the Internal Revenue Service ought to be coining in with these

13

This case is so different from the Bosch case.

The attorney's fee was how much?

MR. PAYMENT:

Was about 16,000, and the executor's

commission was about 17,000 and some odd change.

Well, do you -- do you think that -- do

you think that the IRS may inquire as to whether a surrogate's

Bosch decision requires that result.

11

the Internal Revenue Code, looking at the Park decision of the

QUESTION:

And you say they cannot do that?

MR. PAYMENT:

They — they cannot do it, because

2053 of the Internal Revenue Code makes state law binding.

And Freeman tells us -QUESTION:

Well, state law is what the court of

appeals say it is, not what a surrogate says it is.

7

MR. PAYMENT:

And Freeman -- Freeman — that's true,

8

but Freeman governs the exact discussion here, and the

9

surrogate contended that he followed the Freeman case, and the

10

Freeman case has mainly subjective factors, not just time.
QUESTION:

11

Well, they've — they've got -- the IRS,

I would think, should be able to inquire as to whether what he

did is consistent with Freeman.

faith by the IRS, we don't reach any further question?

MR. PAYMENT:

Bad faith, in our view, is the same as

21

an improper purpose.

22

you cannot second guess the surrogate's decree, you cannot

relitigate this matter, then there is no proper purpose.

if there is no proper purpose, then the summons is in bad

faith.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MR. HOROWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

14

I'd just like to clear up one factual matter before

15

I begin.

The appendix filed in the Court of Appeals does

16

contain the work papers of the agent when-he issued the notice

17

of deficiency.

18

the statute of limitations was about to expire any day, and if

The notice of deficiency was issued because

stated in the work papers.

"No amount

And then it goes on to cite the federal regulation
and the matter of Freeman case in New York court.

7

QUESTION:

So the — the disallowance, then, did

depend on the refusal to obey the summons?

8

MR. HOROWITZ:

9

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

So, it would be hard to say, though, that

10

the summons enforcement proceeding was moot, so long as the

11

entire refund proceeding has been necessitated by that?

12

MR. HOROWITZ:

No, the summons enforcement

13

proceeding is not moot; the refund -- the deficiency is being

litigated.

Yes, but you have the tax?
Well, we have the tax until the

refund suit is litigated, but we don't have it to keep, yet.
QUESTION:

Well, can you use the discovery

proceedings in the refund suit to get the documents?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I guess we can ask, but, as far

24

as I know, the IRS summons power is broader than any discovery

25

right they would have in district court, so I assume if we

can't get it with a summons, we can't get it with discovery,

2

either.
The taxpayer would make the same argument, I

3
4

suppose, that we just have no reason to look at these

5

documents, because we have to follow the surrogate.

6

would be not relevant, just as they were viewed as not

7

relevant by the district court here.

9

And they

So, I don't — I mean if — if — it's true that if
we had sought to discover these documents and the court had

given them to him, that then the case would be moot, but

11

there's no reason to believe that we'll be able to do that.
QUESTION:

the statutes, section 2053, generally suggests, anyway, that

the Internal Revenue Service will accept the fees that are

awarded by the state courts?

administration expenses that are allowable under state law are

to be allowed as a state deduction.

14

underlying merits question that's -- that the Petitioner has

tried to litigate in this case is what does the term

16

"allowable under state law" mean?

17

think it means the same thing that the Court talked about in

highest court.

21

2

that for a deduction, and he took a 10 percent deduction.

3

if it said that whatever the surrogate says is absolutely

4

final, no matter whatever happens.

5

Or

If the statute said that on its face, and then the

6

IRS issued a summons like this, claiming that it wants to

investigate the merits of that deduction, the taxpayer could

8

reasonably come into the summons enforcement court and say,

9

look, there's nothing for them to investigate.

It's clear as

10

a bell, it's clear to us, it's clear to you, it's clear to

11

them that they're not going to be able to disallow this

Now, that would arguably raise an inference that

15

MR. HOROWITZ:

That may be so.
The — the only way in which --

raised an inference of bad faith on the part of the agent,

that it was clear enough that the stated purpose of

investigating tax liability was not the true purpose, and

21

that's not the case here.

Some — somewhere in — somewhere in the

2

Am I right in that?

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, that — that's one of the

3

things that -- that — that I think was a contributing factor

in the decision to investigate this return, because it makes

it a little more questionable what the surrogate might have

MR. HOROWITZ:

I mean, if New York law allows —

Well, New York law allows the same

10

individual to serve as both executor and attorney, but New

11

York law clearly does not allow him to collect a double fee

12

for the same services.

13

that have interfered with that.

14

And there are health division cases

So, our concern here was whether he in fact didn't

do any work as attorney that's distinct from what the executor

16

would do, and whether the attorney's fee was really being paid

for the same services.

19

That's why we asked him to at least

Before the summons was ever issued, he was just

20

asked to give an affidavit of what he did for the estate that

21

warranted this fee, and he refused to provide that.

22

For all we know, he didn't do more than

23

half-an-hour's or an hour's worth of attorney's work.

24

there would be an issue, I suppose, under New York law,

So, I don't think there's anything wrong with the

agent at least wondering whether in fact there was an

independent attorney's work, separate from what the executor

20

had done, that warranted this kind of fee.

the agent is wrong, the district court will tell him so or in

whether the surrogate's allowance of the fee is something that

MR. HOROWITZ:

But no -- none

Well, I -- I mean, I understand that.

Well, that's not the case here.
To try to distinguish it on its

facts, but I think the holding of the Court is that what —

10

what the code means when it talks about applying state law in

11

— in the case of a federal estate tax deduction, what it

12

means is applying the law as set forth by the highest court of

the state.

And the two dissenters in that case, Justice Harlan

and Justice Fortas, wanted to limit the Court's decision just

something.

that.

conditions.
Now, how likely those conditions are to occur is not

2

3

something to be determined before we're allowed to make an

4

investigation.

5

In fact, I think that's most clearly stated in

6

Petitioner's reply brief at page — pages 9 and 10.

7

read as a concession that the IRS can issue a summons to the

8

attorney of the estate as a -- as a means of conducting an

9

investigation of an attorney's -- of the legitimacy of an

10

I -- I

attorney's fee that has been approved by the surrogate.

11

That's exactly what it says here.

12

Now — because of the possibility that there might

13

be fraud. Now, what Respondent -- I'm sorry, Petitioner's

14

defense, that — that he still maintains, is that that's not

15

applicable in this case because the IRS agent didn't say that

16

he was investigating fraud at the time he issued the

summonses.

18
19

And so, maybe you can do that in another case, but
not in this one.

is going.

QUESTION:

But you certainly can say there is a

reason, suggested by Justice Stevens' question that, in Bosch,

there was a motive on the part of all the parties to the

litigation to have it come out a particular way, in order to

reduce their tax liability.

8

Here there is a motive on the part of the

beneficiaries not to want to pay any larger estate attorney's

fee or executor's commission than was required by law.

I don't find the Bosch majority, in

that way.

MR. HOROWITZ:

All right.

Well, what I was

20

responding to was — was the argument the Petitioner made that

21

Bosch applies only to the marital deduction, section 2056, and

22

shouldn't apply here to section 2053.

23

Stevens' point would be that, even in the marital deduction

24

context, Bosch should be given an extremely narrow reading.

25

I think Justice

something that would be litigated down the road, I think, in

Bosch, I think, is that state law means the law of the highest

court, and that the IRS should not be bound by mistakes of

state law, of lower courts.
