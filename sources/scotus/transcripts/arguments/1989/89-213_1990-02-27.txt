Mr. Eakin, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL EAKIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EAKIN:

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In this case we have a drunk driving suspect,

11

Inocencio Muniz, who was legitimately in custody, and that

12

is not at issue.

13

with Mr. Muniz once they lawfully had him in custody.

14

What they did is what they do with the large majority of

15

drunk driving cases, which now number of 1,000 a year in

16

Cumberland County, Pennsylvania.

17

the central booking stations that have been set up and

18

there turned him over to several processing agents,

19

employees of the county whose job it is to do nothing but

20

process drunk driving suspects.

21

What is at issue is what the police did

They took him to one of

What they did was a multi-step function, all of

22

it on videotape.

23

ask him some routine booking questions, his name, his

24

address, his Social Security number and such.

They bring the individual into the room,

They then follow that with several sobriety

They first at this point ask him to try to

calculate the date of his sixth birthday.

3

walk a line, nine steps.

on one leg while counting to 30, and they conduct the

5

horizontal gaze nystagmus test which measures the effect

6

of alcohol on the function of the eye.

QUESTION:

They ask him to

They ask him to balance himself

Mr. Eakin, may I ask you, are these

8

regular — is this the routine that's followed with

9

everyone?

10

MR. EAKIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, sir.
Is it pursuant to regulation, or is

it just this particular police department that does this?

13

MR. EAKIN:

Well, this is the county, which

14

encompasses probably State Police, several military

15

installations and 20-odd local departments.

16

agents do it, and they always do it the same.

17

three of the field tests are what are called the standard

18

field sobriety tests.

19

recommended by the National Highway Traffic Safety —

20

QUESTION:

The county
The latter

They're the ones that are

You said they always do it the same

21

just by custom, not by — no written regulation requires

22

this procedure?

23

MR. EAKIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

No, sir, not by law or regulation.
What would happen if a — if an

individual said I won't do it?

1

MR. EAKIN:

Well, the law, we feel, would allow

2

the police to compel them to do it, but practically

3

speaking there is no way you can compel a person to walk a

4

line and get any useful information.

5

QUESTION:

Does he — does he — does he violate

6

any law if he says I will not recite the alphabet or I

7

will not tell you my sixth birthday?

8

9

MR. EAKIN:

No, sir.

What happens is that the

videotape which is available would indicate the

10

circumstances of the refusal, and so the refusal may come

11

into evidence.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. EAKIN:

Right.
But there's no penalty, excepting

14

the breath test, which is the — the stage of the process

15

that follows these sobriety tests is the breath test.

16

individual is advised that under Pennsylvania law there is

17

an implied consent.

18

you refuse to take it, you will lose your license for an

19

additional year's time, regardless of the conviction or

20

lack of conviction on the underlying drunk driving case.

21

The

/

You have the breath test here.

If

In this case, Mr. Muniz made several statements

22

while that was being explained to him, as is required by

23

Pennsylvania law.

24

that point he was taken again to another table.

25

given his warnings under the Miranda decision, and then

He refused the test eventually.

At

He was

1

for the first time was asked specific questions aimed at

2

his drinking, where he was drinking, what he had to drink,

3

where he was coming from.

4

The test in this case or the issue that is to be

5

resolved, we submit, is the distinction between those

6

latter questions, which are clearly aimed at gaining

7

testimonial evidence from the accused, and everything that

8

went before, which was gained or aimed at gaining physical

9

evidence, demonstrable evidence.

10

QUESTION:

Well, now one of — one of the

11

questions asked at the processing stage was, I believe,

12

what was the date of your sixth birthday.

13

MR. EAKIN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
Now, is that some kind of a routine

15

question that's asked whenever the police think someone

16

might have been drinking?

17

MR. EAKIN:

It was asked routinely in Cumberland

18

County at the time.

19

Court it has not been asked, but it was at that time.

20

is asked at the conclusion of the routine booking

21

questions and immediately before the horizontal gaze

22

nystagmus test.

QUESTION:

Since the decision by the Superior
It

Well, wouldn't the — the information

24

given in the response be relevant on the question of

25

whether the person had been drinking or not?

of the answer, the date of his sixth birthday.

It is not aimed at determining the truth

What it's aimed at —

QUESTION:

10

But whether he responds accurately or

not is relevant?

11

MR. EAKIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

It is another

That's correct.
And you would propose to offer it and

use that against him?

14

MR. EAKIN:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

We

15

would use it to show the physiological effect that alcohol

16

has had on that man's brain, not to elicit the contents of

17

his mind.

The brain controls the tongue —
QUESTION:

Why isn't that a form of

interrogation?
MR. EAKIN:
testimonial evidence.
QUESTION:

Because the goal is not to achieve
It is not to achieve —
Well, it certainly is to get evidence

23

to use against the person to establish whether they've

24

been drinking or not.

That's correct, just as walking the

for an address and a driver's license.

4
5

It's quite unlike asking the person

MR. EAKIN:

That's correct, but it is also

unlike asking him how much did you have to drink.
What it is designed to show is that alcohol has

6

7

affected this man's brain to the point that he cannot do

basic calculations.

QUESTION:

Well, would he have a right to refuse

to answer that question?

question.

15

MR. EAKIN:

He says I refuse to answer that

I suggest he probably would, just as

he can refuse to answer any question.
QUESTION:

Well, could you then put in evidence

the fact that he refused to do the birthday calculation?

16

MR. EAKIN:

17

is not aimed at testimonial —

QUESTION:

We would submit you can, because it

Well, so then he doesn't have the

right to — to — to refuse to decline on Fifth Amendment

20

grounds, at least.

21
22

23

MR. EAKIN:

What he has -- he has no right to be

warned of the consequences of refusal.
QUESTION:

No, he has — under your view he has

24

no self-incrimination right not to answer that question,

because if you say that he does then you can't introduce

his refusal into evidence.
MR. EAR IN:

2

As a practical — perhaps I'm

3

speaking more as a practical matter than anything else,

4

because to — to compel someone in that circumstance

5

is — is practically impossible without intervention —

6

QUESTION:

No.

The question is a simple one,

7

whether or not he has a Fifth Amendment right to decline

8

to answer the question.

10

MR. EAKIN:

Fifth Amendment right not to answer the question.
QUESTION:

We would suggest he does not have a

Just as he doesn't, I suppose, in

your view, to refuse to walk a line?

16

MR. EAKIN:

17

Yes, sir.
Although neither one can actually be

Right.

We have the right to compel

but, practically speaking, no ability to compel.

18

QUESTION:

Is there any challenge in this case

19

to — I — I guess there is — to the introducing the

20

videotape of the physical tests?

21

MR. EAKIN:

In this case, the Pennsylvania

22

Supreme — Superior Court merely suppressed the audio

portion.

that it would be unfair to force the defendant to choose

25

between a video without audio and, therefore, have

QUESTION:

2

Well, how about in this case, in this

case?

4

MR. EAKIN:

that was suppressed.

6

QUESTION:

In this case it was merely the audio

Well, in — in — so the —

7

the — the demonstration that he couldn't walk a straight

8

line, that shows what the effect of alcohol is on his

9

physical coordination, I suppose?
MR. EAKIN:

10

Well, to a degree it does.

In this

11

specific case, his explanations as to why he could not

12

walk the line were certainly relevant.

13

right to ask him to walk the line, I suggest his responses

14

to that request or that demand are just as relevant as the

15

actual walking of the line itself, and there shouldn't be

16

a distinction between his oral refusal to do this test —

It shows the eye tracking a

MR. EAKIN:

Yes, sir.
So it shows — shows the alcohol, the

effect of alcohol on his eye movement?

And is that supposed to show that he

That's correct.
Just like you — you say the — the

birthday question shows the effect of alcohol on his mind?
MR. EAKIN:

That's correct.

It is — the

16

question is not aimed at getting the truthful — what

17

is — how old were you in such and such a year.

18

aimed to show that the mind is affected, not the contents

19

of the mind but the brain being affected by alcohol.

The brain does a lot of things.

It's

But it's

1

because the brain is affected by alcohol, not the tongue

2

itself.
QUESTION:

3

May I just ask this question?

4

You — you did have in this case the fact he refused to

5

take the — the one test.

6

and you can use the staggering down the line.

7

8

it almost sounds cumulative to me here that what we're

9

fighting about.
MR. EAKIN:

10

You can use the eye movements,
Do you

It seems to me —

It may be, Your Honor, but the goal

11

of the testing is to establish a routine that gives the

12

best possible evidence to the finder of fact, and the

13

three standard tests developed by the Highway Safety

14

Council are ones that have statistically been shown to

15

correlate to a very high degree to persons over the legal

16

limit.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask this question, too:

if the

18

issue were not whether the man was intoxicated, but say it

19

was in a different kind of criminal proceeding and the

20

issue were whether he was mentally competent to stand

21

trial, or mentally competent to receive the death penalty,

22

or something like that, would you say you could perform

23

these tests without giving him warning?

24
25

MR. EAKIN:

I think that would have to be on a

case by case basis.

QUESTION:

1

Why?

Isn't it the same issue?

I

2

mean, the question is whether the privilege against self­

3

incrimination protects him from making these verbal

4

statements.

5

should matter.

6

I don't know why the nature of the proceeding

MR. EAKIN:

The case I think of is the Estelle

7

case, where the psychiatrist in that case was using the

8

substance of what was related to him rather than forming

9

conclusions without regard to the substance of it.
If here we are to introduce, for the truth of

10

11

what is said, his response, that's different, and I think

12

in the mental health cases and insanity defenses that —
QUESTION:

13

Sometimes that's true, but you could

14

also have a case where you just want to find out how his

15

mind works when he's asked to recite the alphabet and when

16

he's asked about his sixth birthday and that sort of

17

thing, I would think.

18

MR. EAKIN:

I don't know.
I think in those cases, Your Honor,

19

it would be proper, because again, it's not testimonial in

20

nature, it's demonstrative in nature.

21

QUESTION:

Suppose — suppose the issue is

22

whether or not — or one of the issues in the case is

23

whether or not he can speak Spanish, and the police

24

officers start talking to him in Spanish to see if he

25

responds.

Can they ask him, do you speak Spanish?

MR. EAKIN:

In that case, I believe it would be

proper because you're not asking for a specific fact in

his mind, but merely a —■

4
5
6

QUESTION:

And his answer, in your view, is not

used to incriminate him, based on his knowledge?
MR. EAKIN:

It would be to incriminate him, but

not because of the contents of his mind, just as in the

8

Dionisio case, where —

mind, don't you?

12

MR. EAKIN:

How do you know Spanish?

Do you

No, of course you learn it in your

The ability to speak Spanish

13

certainly is contained in the mind, but if the court, as

14

you have, have allowed us to take voice exemplars, or to

15

speak at a line-up, the language in which you speak is

16

equally as nonintrusive.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose this defendant is very

18

nervous, and he — what he does is, he takes his existing

19

age and he subtracts six, and then he takes that number

20

and subtracts it from today's date, and he comes out wrong

21

either because he doesn't quite do it right, or because he

22

misses a month.

23

Still admissible in evidence?

24

MR. EAKIN:

25

He uses years and he has a late birthday.

I'd suggest it's admissible, but

certainly the weight of it is something that is always —

1
2

Would he have to get onto the stand

to explain how he did it and why he made the mistake?
MR. EAKIN:

3

The same as he can get on the stand

4

to explain why he didn't walk the line properly or balance

5

properly, or anything else, he can get on to explain

6

why —

7

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me it's

8

qualitatively different, because you're asking him to

9

perform a mental feat that requires verbal articulation,

10

and that's what the Fifth Amendment is designed to protect

11

against.

12

MR. EAKIN:

Well, the cases have clearly stated

13

that if the purpose is to get the contents of the mind,

14

that's one thing, but the processes of the brain in being

15

able to do basic math or recite the alphabet or things

16

that are not in and of themselves indicative of the

17

contents of the mind of an individual relative to what

18

they're looking for, that is different and ought to be

19

maintained as different.

20

manifestation rather than a physical should not matter.

21

We don't have them walk the line —

22

QUESTION:

The mere fact that it is an oral

That's because the Fifth Amendment is

23

concerned with testimonial communication.

24

we're concerned and that's why there might be a

25

difference.

That's why

MR. EAKIN:

2

QUESTION:

There might be a —
Don't you think the question is one

3

that the police would reasonably expect would result in an

4

incriminating response under these circumstances?
MR. EAKIN:

5
6

Only in the same level as they would

expect it —

7

QUESTION:

There was every indication this

8

person had been drinking.

There were lots of indications

9

he'd been drinking — staggering around and slurred speech

10

and what have you — so they knew when they asked that

11

birthday question it was likely to give an incriminating

12

response.

13

MR. EAKIN:

Just as they knew when he would walk

14

the line he was likely to incriminate himself in that

15

manner, but not in a testimonial sense.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. EAKIN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. EAKIN:

But that's not an interrogation.
It's not an interrogation —
And this is.
It's not because it's not

20

testimonial; it is physical.

21

the inability to count to six is, I suggest, the same as

22

the inability to walk six steps.

23

It is demonstrative.

The function affected is the brain.

But

We're not

24

asking him to disclose any information about it.

25

that he is more likely to say something incriminating or

QUESTION:

5

MR. EAKIN:

Was he asked to recite the alphabet?
No, not in this case.

Again, this

6

case was after the Bruder case in Pennsylvania which at

7

the time said that was improper because the contents of

8

the alphabet were testimony, which I suggest they're not.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Eakin, there is this difference

10

between this case and the other nontestimonial cases that

11

you talk about.

12

the content of his mind is not the object of the

13

enterprise.

14

the means, and in these other cases — that is, because of

15

the current content of his mind you know that he's drunk.

It seems to me you're quite correct that

It's not the end that is sought.

But it is

You don't want to introduce the content of his

16
17

mind, but the means of showing that he's drunk is finding

18

out the current content of his mind.

acknowledge that difference, and that that's quite

20

different from walking a line or being compelled to give a

21

handwriting exemplar or a voice sample or anything like

22

that?

16

the inability to arrive at that conclusion, which is a

process of the brain, that is affected by alcohol.

Now, maybe it's okay, but it's different from all of the

MR. EAKIN:

Well, it is different in that sense,

I agree,

14

physical, is not the basis for the Court's distinction

between testimonial and demonstrative evidence — it never

The fact that no

I think the record is clear that these were

A distinction must be drawn in this case because

8

the defendant is actually an element of the offense.

9

Commonwealth must prove for a conviction driving under the

Driving under the influence is a

10

influence of alcohol to a degree that makes the person

11

incapable of safe driving.

12

The

"Under the influence of alcohol" is defined by

13

the Pennsylvania courts as to include any mental or

14

physical condition as a result of drinking that either

15

makes the person unfit to drive or substantially impairs

16

judgment, clearness of intellect or normal faculties

17

essential for safe driving.

18

And Pennsylvania courts have defined

19

"substantial impairment" to be diminution or enfeeblement

20

in ability to exercise judgment, to deliberate or to react

21

prudently to changed circumstances.

QUESTION:

I would define "testimonial" as

QUESTION:

2

3

Well, how about asking the person the

name and address?
MR. MAFFETT:

4

Well, in some circumstances the

5

name and address may not be testimonial.

It may be

6

considered — I would submit it would be testimonial

7

because it discloses the contents of the mind.

8

it would not be interrogation because it would be found to

9

be incident to normal arrest and custody.

Sometimes

However, in the drunk driving situation where

10

11

practically anything can disclose the contents of the mind

12

and can be expected to produce an incriminating response

13

that — that then even asking the name and address without

14

being — without giving the Miranda warnings would be

15

considered interrogation.

16

QUESTION:

So you think here every single

QUESTION:

3
4

So would it be all right here to ask

the defendant to recite the alphabet?
MR. MAFFETT:

5

It would not because it would

involve his intellectual capacity to put the letters

together, to remember what comes after B.

QUESTION:

No.

It's just like being given a

sentence to write.
MR. MAFFETT:

10

Except that if he forgets how to

11

write the sentence, he can look on the paper and see it to

12

write it.
In fact, there's a case, United States v.

14

Campbell, which is the court of appeals — it's not this

15

circuit — which where the individual had to spell the

16

exemplar, where the exemplar was dictated to them but they

17

had to pick the spelling, that that was found to be

18

testimonial because the person conveyed the contents of

19

his thought process, this is how I spell — how I spell

20

the word.

21

And so similarly, if you are asked to recite the

22

ABCs, again that's not this case, but if you're asked to

23

recite the ABCs and you have to pick what comes after D

exactly what the Fifth Amendment was intended to protect.

1

May I — may I question that, Mr.

It seems to me when you talk about the contents

contents of which are all sorts of information, data,

facts and the like.

6

how well the machinery in the warehouse is working, and

7

that is, does it, if you're asked to recite the alphabet

Because

A case that can be analogized to this case was

10

It involved the assassination of -- or

attempted assassination of President Reagan.
Now the FBI took Mr. Hinckley in for about 20 or

parents lived, his address, did he have girlfriends, where

14

did he work, how far had he gone in school, those sorts of

things.

16

because it didn't have directly to do with the elements of

the offense that he was charged with.

It was nothing even as overt as this case,

18

But the court found that since the agents were

aware that there was a likelihood that there would be an

arrest itself, without counsel, he does not know of his

right not to have the conversation, to make a choice based

3

on the consequences of these seemingly innocent questions

4

and instructions.
Because the questions, on their face, to the

5
6

defendant, are -- are statistical, and may be — may seem

7

to him to be to ensure he understood, without being told

8

that he has a right to remain silent, or that whatever he

9

says might be used against him, he has no way to know that

10

he doesn't have to answer and that his responses may be

11

used later at trial to convict him.

12

QUESTION:

(Inaudible) statements during the

13

testing, the so-called voluntary statements during the

14

testing?

15

he had to say those things?

16

He — could he have possibly have thought that

MR. MAFFETT:

Well, I think most of the

17

statements during the testing were — again, he was trying

18

to show, to communicate that he was not intoxicated,

19

because he said things like, "I can't walk this way even

20

when I'm at home," or "I can't walk this way even when I'm

21

at work," or "I can't" — "My legs are not so good."

22

there were things that he was trying to explain why he

23

couldn't do the tests that they asked him to do.

24

In fact, on the video —

The audio of all of that was

excluded, wasn't it?

2

MR. MAFFETT:

Yes, it was.

Yes.

3

At one point on the video he even said — he was

4

told, well, we'll read you your Miranda warnings later,

5

and he said something to the effect of, "I know you people

6

are pretty fair about it."

7

I mean, he was relying on them to be fair with him

10

convict him.

11
12

He had no idea that what they

And this would not, if you —

QUESTION:

Well, he didn't think that the tests

he was given had some bearing on whether he would be held?
MR. MAFFETT:

13

He may have, but as far as his

14

words, I can't tell you.

15

told that — and especially his statement, "I know you

16

people will be pretty fair about it" is an illustration

17

that he thought that something else was going on, other

18

than getting evidence.

19

QUESTION:

He wouldn't know without being

Well, it could just as well have

20

meant he thought the police would not distort the results,

21

they would be even-handed, not that they weren't doing

22

anything to build a case against him.

MR. MAFFETT:

I suppose that's another fair

Pennsylvania Superior Court it would not appreciably

2

affect the way these booking procedures are done.

3

defendant can still be asked his name and his address and

4

any other biographical information that they need, but if

5

they don't read him his rights, they just can't use that

6

part in evidence, and I would argue that as far as whether

7

or not it would make any difference if you did read the

8

man his rights at the beginning, that in fact it would

9

not.

The

It's been my practice in Cumberland County since

10

11

the time of this decision that now, in fact, they do read

12

him his rights as soon as the man comes to the police

13

station and again, just from my practice, it doesn't make

14

any — hasn't made any difference on whether the people

15

say something or not.
QUESTION:

16

Is Cumberland County just to the west

17

of Dauphin County?

18

County, but your office I see is in Harrisburg.

19

You say you practice in Cumberland

MR. MAFFETT:

They're very close.

They're

20

within — across the river is Cumberland County from

21

Dauphin.

22

Lastly, the advantage of Miranda has always been

23

its clarity — it's bright line.

The police, the

24

prosecutors, the lower courts, know what must be done for

questioning and under what circumstances statements are

admissible.
If you make an exception to the facts for this

3

case, it's going to lead to a lot of litigation.

4

result would be an elaborate set of rules and exceptions

5

and distinctions, and nobody — not the police, not the

6

prosecutors, not the courts — are going to know with any

7

certainty as to any particular situation whether or not

8

the interrogation is permissible.

9

The end

If you allow the kind of conduct or questioning

10

or the process that occurred here, you put a premium on

11

the police devising these indirect interrogation methods,

12

these tricky things of the sixth birthday question and

13

other similar indirect questions.

14

Because the — what happened at the booking

15

center is actually — if — it actually incriminated and

16

was just as deadly to Mr. Muniz as if he'd have been

17

asked, "are you drunk," if for all intents and purposes

18

his responses said, "I am drunk."

19

And I would argue that because the utterances

20

disclosed the contents of his mind, his reasoning ability,

21

that they were testimonial and protected by the Fifth

22

Amendment, and since he was subject to interrogation

23

without Miranda warnings, that the audio portion of the

24

videotape was correctly ruled inadmissible.

25

If there are no other questions, I'll sit down.

Mr. Eakin, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL EAKIN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. EAKIN:

Thank you.

May it please the Court:

6

I would suggest that what the Court's being

7

asked to do by Mr. Maffett is to extend Miranda to cover

8

situations of custodial sobriety testing that it's not

9

designed for, and that instead of the contrary, trying to

10

devise a set of rights that an intoxicated suspect will

11

understand that tells him he has a right to remain silent

12

except you've got to do these tests, would be completely

13

unworkable.

14

Because the tests are designed to get physical,

15

demonstrative evidence and that's all they're designed to

16

get, I suggest that the present law covers that and covers

17

it quite clearly, and Miranda warnings should not be

18

extended to apply to this situation.

19
20

Unless the Court has other questions, I'll
forego the rest of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The case is submitted.
