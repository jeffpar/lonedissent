This case comes to this Court as a collateral

The Plaintiff ultimately prevailed on the theory of

liability under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and

This case presents a question of statutory

intent is the first inquiry of this Court.
QUESTION:

15

16

I would think the language of the

statute might be the first inquiry.
MR. McELROY:

17

Precisely, in determining

18

legislative intent, Your Honor, the first question is what

19

the statute says.
The statute, as I said, was part of the Federal

20
21

Courts Improvement Act.

In Section 402 of that act,

22

Congress expressly stated that unless otherwise specified,

23

the provisions of the act shall take effect on October 1,

24

1982, six months after the date of the enactment of the

25

statute.

This Court has, on at least three prior

1

occasions, found that the existence of an effective date,

2

and a delayed effective date in particular, is evidence

3

that Congress did not intend that statute to apply

4

retroactively.
And, in fact, it makes sense, because if

5
6

Congress had intended that judgments entered prior to the

7

effective date, and even prior to the enactment date, were

8

to be governed by the amendment, there would be simply no

9

reason whatsoever to delay the effective date for six

10

months.

11

that the reason that it was delaying the effective date

12

was to permit a transition period for the Bar and the

13

business community to become familiar with its terms.

14

Again, a purpose that would be wholly meaningless if it

15

were to be applied to judgments entered two, three years

16

prior to the date of the amendment.

17

Congress even stated in the legislative history

In addition, when Congress wanted this act to

18

apply to pending cases, it knew exactly how to do so.

19

Section 403 of the act, under the title effect on pending

20

cases, there is not one reference to the amendment to the

21

post-judgment interest statute.

22

provisions of the act which Congress wanted to have an

23

effect on pending cases, and it knew how to express its

24

intent in that regard.

1

adopted under the act, and which carries forward the

2

statutory scheme under the prior statute, is to award

3

interest as of the date of the entry of judgment.

4

judgment is entered, interest remains constant throughout

5

post trial, post judgment proceedings, through appeals,

6

until the judgment is paid.

7

QUESTION:

Once

What is the effect of the appeal?

8

Does that mean that the right to post-judgment interest is

9

not vested during the appeal?

10
11

MR. McELROY:

The right to post-judgment

interest vests as of the date of the entry of judgment.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. McELROY:

Regardless of the appeal?
Well, it is — it is no doubt true

14

that if the judgment is overturned there is no obligation

15

on the part of the defendant to pay the judgment.

16

subject matter of this statute is the rate of interest.

17

And the rate of interest is set as of the date of entry of

18

judgment, and does not change, no matter what happens.

19

The mere fact that the obligation is extinguished by the

20

fact that the court overturns the judgment should not —

21

does not change that rate.

22

But the

And it is — and, what I was going to say, Your

23

Honor, was that Congress quite purposely chose that,

24

because it had a very substantial countervailing concern

25

about the reliance interest of defendants.

It wanted

1

defendants to be able to know what the financial impact

2

would be on the exercise of their post judgment remedies.

3

And to -- under those circumstances it is implausible, I

4

suggest, to ascribe to Congress an intent that it would

5

change the post-judgment interest on a judgment entered

6

prior to its effective date by retroactive application of

7

the law.

The post-judgment interest indeed

And why shouldn't it run at the T-

bill rate, for that period at least?
MR. McELROY:

Because it frustrates the reliance

obligation is going to be once they embark on the process

22

of seeking to overturn the judgment against them.

2

MR. McELROY:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And you argue from that that they

4

certainly therefore didn't intend the T-bill rate to apply

5

before that date.

6

MR. McELROY:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. McELROY:

9

That is correct, Your Honor.

Well, what about after that date?
Well, they did in fact intend that

the T-bill rate would apply after that date, but only to

10

judgments entered after that date.

11

the statutory language is interest shall be calculated

12

from the date of the entry of judgment.

13

interest is set for all time.

14

that date, the date of the entry of judgment, that

15

defendants are relying on what their financial obligations

16

are going to be.
QUESTION:

17

As I -- as I stated,

At that time, the

It, once -- and,

it's at

Well, maybe Congress meant that it

18

would apply to judgments becoming final after that date.

19

True, the judgment was entered earlier, but it didn't

20

become final until after the effective date of the new

21

law.

22

MR. McELROY:

If the statute said that interest

23

runs from the date of a final judgment,

24

don't have a question of retroactivity here —

25

QUESTION:

No, no.

I agree that we

It makes the date from which

1

it runs clearly go back, but it perhaps means that the

2

rate of interest will attach according to when the

3

judgment became final.

4

MR. McELROY:

Oh, I don't — I think that is

5

clearly contrary to the express language of the statute,

6

Your Honor.

7

of the entry of judgment, and it makes no difference,

8

under the statutory scheme, what happens after the entry

9

of judgment.

The rate of interest attaches as of the date

It will be at that rate, and it doesn't

10

change.

And I think that it would be a perversion of the

11

congressional intent to say that we are going to determine

12

what the rate is as of a particular later time, when

13

Congress has expressly said it will apply as of, and be

14

calculated as of, the date of the entry of judgment.
That that is the proper construction of the

15

16

statute is further reinforced, in our view, by the way in

17

which the Administrative Office of the United States

18

Courts has interpreted the statute.

19

Congress has charged the Administrative Office with the

20

obligation of informing federal judges of the appropriate

21

rates of interest that judgments will carry in federal

22

court.

23

a memorandum to all of the federal judges in response to

24

several questions addressed to the office, and stated

25

that, in their view, the statute should not be interpreted

Under the amendment,

On July 27, 1982, the Administrative Office issued

to apply to judgments entered prior to the effective date

of the act.

3

As a result of that, the practice in most of the

4

circuits has been just that.

Administrative Office of the U.S. Court is entitled to

9

MR. McELROY:

I am arguing that it is entitled

10

to be given weight, because of the fact, under the

11

circumstances of this case, Congress has set up a system

12

pursuant to which it, the Administrative Office, has an

13

obligation to inform the judiciary of what the rates of

14

interest are on judgments.

statute.

weight, but the court of appeals in this case not only

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. McELROY:

5

Well, was it argued?
It was definitely argued, yes,

Your Honor.
In the absence of legislative intent, the Court

6
7

has before it two competing presumptions of statutory

8

construction.

9

Richmond School Board, the Court has said that courts are

Under the Court's decision in Bradley v.

10

to apply the law in effect at the time that they render

11

the decision, unless to do so will result in manifest

12

injustice.

13

Last term this Court reaffirmed the long­

14

standing principle of statutory construction that

15

statutory enactments will not be construed retroactively

16

unless their language requires that result.

17

The courts below have applied the Bradley

18

standard to this issue.

19

appeals also applied the Bradley standard, and we believe

20

that it was seriously flawed in its analysis.

21

like to go through that at this point, because obviously

22

if the Court were to find, to agree with us, that its

23

analysis was flawed, it does not have to deal with the

24

additional issue of these competing presumptions.

25

4

the change of law has on those rights.

5

the nature of the parties, simply requires the court to

6

identify whether they are private parties, and that their

7

private interests are at stake by the retroactive

8

application of the statute.

9

Chief Justice Marshall's language in the Schooner Peggy

The nature of the parties, the

The first element,

This factor derives from

10

case, that courts ought to struggle hard against a

11

retroactive construction in cases — in private cases

12

between private individuals.

13

Chief Justice Marshall went on to say, however,

14

that if the statute touches upon a matter of great

15

national concern — in that case it was a treaty between

16

France and the United States — if a statute touches upon

17

a matter of great national concern, then the private

18

interests of private parties should give way to that

19

national interest.

20

In applying the Bradley and Schooner Peggy

21

principles to this case, the court of appeals acknowledged

22

that this was private individuals involved in this case,

23

but then stated that because the underlying merits claim

24

was an antitrust case, that it took on a matter of public

25

interest, and therefore there was no impediment to the

1

retroactive application of the post-judgment interest

2

statute.
We believe that the court identified the wrong

3
4

statute.

If a statute is to apply retroactively because

5

it involves a matter of great national concern, then it is

6

the post-judgment interest statute that the court should

7

have looked to to determine whether or not it involves a

8

matter of great national concern, thereby justifying

9

retroactive application of the statute.

It has not been

Moreover, it

1

should attempt to identify the interests that are

2

adversely affected by the statute.

3

Clearly it was not the Plaintiff's interests

4

that were adversely affected by the — the retroactive

application of this statute, but it was the — it was

Kaiser's rights to a certain — to pay — Kaiser's

7

obligation to pay at 6 percent, Kaiser's reliance interest

8

on that being the rate of interest that would be applied

9

to that judgment.

Once having identified the appropriate

10

rights, having fixed as of the date of the entry of

11

judgment, it is clear that those rights, and the

12

obligation that the statute imposed, was mature and

13

unconditional.

Your Honor, our position is, and I think we have set it

forth in our briefs, and I think the justice of the case

demands it, and that is that once you find that there has

been liability, once you find that this Defendant, through

21

willful, intentional and predatory acts, destroyed the

small business of these Plaintiffs and drove them out of

business and caused them harm.

QUESTION:

Well, you can — but you can say the

that was the regime for a long time.

MR. REATH:

I mean,

Your Honor, where you have, and I

think that is the very reason to come back to Rule 37,

where you have a situation such as the present case, where

9

you have long, extended appeals —

10

If Your Honors would take a look at the time

the Court to take a look at it, Your Honors will see there

that there is an incredibly long time period over which

this case was hanging on appeal.

is that where the court — reinstates, where the court

reinstates an earlier judgment, it shall give appropriate

years until the final decision in the Supreme Court.

And

11

the two questions the Court had to consider was one,

12

whether or not there would be interest, whether or not you

13

could have — whether the taxes were properly imposed.

14

And secondly whether interest would run.

15

court held that both you could collect the delinquent

16

taxes, and going back to the date when the delinquent

17

taxes were first due, interest would also run from that

18

date.

And there the

Now, there was no specific statute that would

19
20

have covered the situation.

And here is what the Court

21

said.

22

ago here decided, and I am referring to this Court, in

23

view of the true conception of interest, that a statute

24

was not necessary to compel its payment where, in

25

accordance with the principles of equity and justice in

Thus as to the necessity for a statute, it was long

1

the enforcement of an obligation interest should be

2

allowed.
Now, that was precisely the situation that

3
4

Justice Blackmun was faced with when he was on the Eighth

5

Circuit, where, in the Ralston Purina case, it was a case

6

where the defendant had won on a counter-claim in the

7

first instance.

8

The appellate court reversed, sent it back for a new

9

trial.

The case went up to the appellate court.

On a new trial the defendant again won.

So if

10

this was the first time they had a formal judgment, the

11

earlier judgment had been taken away.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Reath, can I ask you about that?

13

I thought that Billings case did not involve interest on

14

the judgment, but it involved interest as an added penalty

15

for failure to pay the tax.

16

MR. REATH:

QUESTION:

18

MR. REATH:

19

No, sir.

Oh -- no.

No?
That is not my understanding of it,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I mean, the federal tax statutes do

21

provide that if you don't pay the tax you are subject to

the amount of the tax plus interest for your failure to

pay the tax.

I think it was, Your Honor, and I

think that was the issue that the court had to concern

itself with.

Honor, the — here it is — 28 U.S. 1961, the very

8

interest statute we are talking about, provides

specifically, in Section C(4), this section shall not be

10

construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any

QUESTION:

Now --

At what point, under your theory, Mr.

13

Reath, do you say that the court of appeals should have

prescribed this other interest rate?

16

MR. REATH:

The most recent

Your Honor, in 1984, when the court

17

reversed and reinstated the earlier judgment, we could not

— the mandate wasn't going down because Kaiser decided

19

that they wanted to appeal it.

20

that it came back to the court of appeals in 1986, when —

21

as soon as the case came back from this Court in 1986 to

And therefore the moment

22

go to the court of appeals to issue its mandate, we went

23

to the court and said under Rule 37, please give

24

appropriate instructions with respect to the allowance of

25

interest.

And at that point they then — then a

1

stipulation was reached between the parties that rather

2

than have that issue decided by the court of appeals, it

3

would be decided in the first instance by the lower court.

4

So in effect the lower court was acting as an agent for

the court of appeals in deciding the allowance of interest

under Rule 37.

before this Court.

So that -- and that is how this case came

in the 1984 proceeding before the court of appeals that
the interest was fixed at the rate you set?

MR. REATH:

Well, so — but it should have been

Yes.
And then was that ultimately decided

by the district court on remand, the point you -MR. REATH:

Yes, Your Honor.

In other words,

15

what happened — in 1986, when the case came back from

16

this Court to the court of appeals, that is when the issue

17

was first presented, because -- and that is what the court

18

below found in its opinion.

19

QUESTION:

But neither the district court nor

20

the court of appeals agreed with you on the — on this

21

market rate.

22

23

MR. REATH:

That is right.

And, respectfully,

Your Honor, they were wrong.
Your Honor, when you realize that the value to
this Defendant, the difference between the T-bill rate and

1

market rate in this case, over the full period that

2

interest should run, is more than $8 million.

3

means that if this Court rules that it doesn't have the

4

power, it doesn't have the power to tell the court of

5

appeals that it has the power to award — appropriate

6

proper interest, the result is that by taking these

7

appeals, this Defendant will have, as a bare minimum,

8

saved itself $8 million, merely by the delay of time,

9

because that was the value to them on the use of our

10

11
12

13

Now, that

money.
QUESTION:

At what point, in your view, should

this higher rate of interest begin — have begun to run?
MR. REATH:

Your Honor, it begins to run,

14

whatever rate of interest begins, and it is determined,

15

and that is why -- it should be when the final decision is

16

made that you are entitled to win.

17

that we had any right at all to any interest.

18

the reason, among other things, that —

It wasn't until 1986

So it should run from 1986?

MR. REATH:

No, sir, you deal with --

QUESTION:

But my question is when should it

have begun to run?
MR. REATH:

Oh, it should begin to run as of the

date of the judgment.

MR. REATH:

2

QUESTION:

The 1979 judgment of liability.
But Rule — Rule 37 says if the

3

judgment is affirmed the interest provided for in the

4

district court statute is the rate of interest.

5

reversed or modified, then the court of appeals can

6

provide.

7

if the judgment is upheld you get one rate of interest

8

from the time it runs; if it is reversed or modified you

9

get a different rate?

10

If it is

It doesn't make much sense, does it, to say that

MR. REATH:

Your Honor, there is another

11

provision in the statute that — no, I don't think it

12

does, to answer your question.

13

QUESTION:

14
15

You say that isn't the necessary

result of the language?
MR. REATH:

That is not the necessary result,

16

because there is another section of the Rule, which is

17

Section 1912, which awards —

QUESTION:

19

MR. REATH:

No, sir.

That is the counterpart of

QUESTION:

fundamental.

question that there are two different provisions in the

MR. REATH:

Your Honor, the first sentence, and

12

I am indebted to Mr. Mazo for pointing this out, first

13

sentence of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure Rule 37

14

says unless otherwise provided by law.

15

Your Honor that in either situation, if you can show that

16

there is a long, extended period, an unconscionable

17

benefit flowing to the defendant from the result of a long

18

period of delay, that the appellate court would have, and

should have, the power to right that wrong and —

federal common law that has been adopted and recognized by

this Court.
QUESTION:

3

So we should read unless otherwise

provided by law as unless otherwise provided by law,

6

MR. REATH:

I think that is a reasonable and

7

permissible interpretation to make, yes, Your Honor.

8

think the question — the question here is does the power

9

— does the court of appeals have the power to preserve

I

10

the integrity of awards that come out of its court.

11

the fact of the matter is that here was a jury which said,

12

one jury said this defendant was — had his business

be compensated.

15

in the amount of $9.5 million.

16
17
18

It was put out of business.

Now,

It is entitled to

Another jury said it is to be compensated

Now, the question is, is the court powerless
today to say you don't get the $9.5 million because you —
they have been deprived of the use of the money.

If our

19

— if the market rate theory prevails, Your Honor, the

20

amount of interest that is owed is $18.6 million, the

21

amount of the verdict is $9.5 million, the total amount,

the total amount of the claim is $28 million.

what the $9.5 million in 1979 is worth today.

this power says in part.

but it is competent for the legislature to prescribe the

payment of interest as a penalty for delay in the payment

to discuss the issue of whether, not you get interest

after the judgment for the government, but whether the

government was entitled to interests from the date the tax

was not paid.

It is part of the judgment, not interest on

might support your -- what you are arguing to us?

The power of the court to simply

prescribe whatever that interest might properly be.
MR. REATH:

Young v. Godbe, Your Honor, is

another example.

That's a case where there was no

have the inherent power.

again to say two points.

that there is an elephant — element of manifest injustice

The court below analyzed those and pointed out

11

disparity between state rates and federal rates came in a

recommendation from President Carter in 1979 in February.

The court?

This was President Carter to

the Senate, stated — stated to the Senate that the time

18

would come that 1961 should be changed, because of the

19

great disparity between state rates and true market rates.

20

And what they point out there was that one of the reasons

21

that the court has to be so concerned about this issue is

22

because you cannot provide an incentive for delay by

23

permitting one defendant to delay, and he pays -- his cost

24

of money is up here at market, and he pays a submarket

rate, and he uses the difference between the two to

MR. REATH:

QUESTION:

Mr. Reath, may I ask —
— since 1979.
Supposing we didn't have such large

8

sums involved, we just had an ordinary personal injury

case where you have a separate trial and liability, and

10

then you follow it with a separate trial on damages.

11

it your view that the rule should always be that the

12

interest runs from the date of the liability verdict?
MR. REATH:

13

Is

Yes, Your Honor, and that was

14

precisely what happened in the Mascuilli case which we

15

cite out of the Third Circuit.

16

in that case is particularly germane to this issue,

17

because there the court had a long period of time between

18

the liability and the final award, and it said — the

19

court said this, the lower court, which was affirmed by

the Third Circuit.

MR. McELROY:

Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that

this was complicated, and if there is any area that should

that the Billings case was a pre-judgment interest case,
