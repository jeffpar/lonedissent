ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. STARR:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These two cases bring before the Court a single

12

13

question:

14

United States from prosecuting individuals for knowingly

15

burning a flag of the United States.

16

the United States District Court for the District of

17

Columbia and the United States District Court for the

18

Western District of Washington, held that the Flag

19

Protection Act of 1989, passed by Congress in response to

20

this Court's decision in Texas against Johnson, was

21

unconstitutional as applied to the conduct of the

22

individuals here.

23

whether the First Amendment prohibita the

Two district courts,

In both cases it is undisputed that each of the

24

appellees knowingly burned a flag of the United States and

25

thus violated the statute.

In our view, there are four

1

reasons that argue powerfully in support of the

2

constitutionality of this statute.

3

First, Congress acted carefully and with great

4

respect for this Court's decisions concerning flag

5

protection statutes.

6

expressed statement in Texas against Johnson that the

7

inquiry there was bounded not only by the facts of the

8

case, but by the state's statute there in question.

9

It took seriously the Court's

In relying on this Court's various writings and

10

decisions, Congress amended the Federal statute in

11

response to Texas against Johnson to eliminate the prior,

12

clearly content-laden language of Section 700, the

13

language, "cast contempt upon" and "publicly."

14

Second, Congress acted very narrowly.

It

15

focused, as this Court said in Smith v. Goguen, that it

16

could lawfully do, on certain specific areas of conduct

17

where legislative latitude is greater.

18

carved out a narrowly crafted set of protections as to

19

certain conduct, while permitting robust and uninhibited

20

speech to continue unabated.

21
22

23

And Congress

There was no prohibition on Congress' part
against the publication or the dissemination of ideas.
Third and relatedly, as I will seek to show in

24

the context of the facts of these two cases, flag burning

25

leaves a major message gap, a gap that needs to be filled

in with words, either written or spoken, as happened in

2

both the District of Columbia and Seattle demonstrations.

3

It is, in our judgment, the equivalent of shouting or

4

screaming or using a loudspeaker at full blast to arrest

5

the audience's attention.

6

especially weighty value on the First Amendment scales.

7

Fourth, on the other side of those scales are

This is not in our judgment an

8

interests of the highest order in the national community.

9

Those interests are intangible, to be sure, just as the

10

concept of human dignity is intangible.

But those

11

interests are no less real, rooted as they are in the

12

Nation's history and experience, and especially our

13

history as a community of people in this century in which

14

so many of our co-members of the national community have

15

been asked to sacrifice so much.
To focus now on the facts and the nature of flag

16
17

burning.

18

content of this conduct, it is useful to examine precisely

19

what happened here and what it is that flag burning

conveys.

21

statement of Shawn Eichman, one of the District of

22

Columbia appellees.

23

her conduct were quite varied in nature.

24

civil rights concerns to concerns about the environment,

25

and concerns about certain aspects of U.S. foreign policy.

In evaluating the expressive content, the

This can be seen by way of example in the

Ms. Eichman's concerns that animated

They ranged from

The same is true with respect to the Seattle

2

demonstration, a videotape of which is in the record.

3

concerns that were animating the Seattle appellees ranged

4

from a then ongoing labor strike at Boeing Aircraft

5

facilities in the area to the treatment afforded Hispanic

6

Americans and national policies concerning the homeless.

7

Now a passerby happening on these acts of flag

8

burning would, in our judgment, likely and reasonably

9

conclude that the actor is in a state of profound

10

disagreement.

11

message, the what, comes, if at all, from the speech that

12

is incident or tied to the conduct as occurred in Street

this conduct, maybe you should try to ban it on the

2

grounds that it's misleading speech?

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. STARR:

It may in say -- in fact say too

5

much, and more than the actor intended to convey, if in

6

fact Justice Scalia is correct.

7
8

QUESTION:

Are you saying that this is an

invalid form of protest?
MR. STARR:

9

In our .judgment, it is conduct, and

10

conduct gives much greater latitude to Congress as long as

11

Congress does not do as the State of Texas did in Texas

12

against Johnson, and that is, pass a statute that was not

13

viewpoint neutral.

14

to this case -- to this Court was that a conviction in

15

that case depended upon the communicative impact.

16

not so here.

17

The way Texas v. Johnson was presented

That is

An individual runs afoul of this statute

18

regardless of what message, if any, that individual is

19

seeking to convey.

20

proscribed acts that are forbidden, regardless of the

21

message.

Is that a proper exercise of the sentencing

I think that's one of the reasons

Congress saw fit to pass the reform statute that has given

us sentencing guidelines.

QUESTION:

That is precisely the sort of

guidelines or not, but suppose that, permissibly within

10

the guidelines, the district court said that.

12

MR. STARR:

Would that

As long as it were within the

13

statutory maximum, I believe it would be constitutionally

14

permitted, yes.

15
16
17

As long as it's within the maximum.

QUESTION:

But isn't that precisely what we said

could not be done in — in the Gregory case?
MR. STARR:

Well, what — it seems to me that is

18

going on here is that Congress has focused on a specific

19

act of conduct, and it has said, why is it that we are

20

prohibiting this conduct.

21

ways, by virtue, at times, of its symbolic importance.

not so here.

13

carefully, very respectfully, as well as prior indications

14

from this Court, most Clearly stated in Smith against

15

Goguen, that nothing prohibits a legislature — as long as

16

it avoids vagueness concerns, nothing prohibits a

17

legislature from providing physical protection to symbols.

18

Congress read this Court's decision very

In the legislative history it was quite clear

19

that Congress had presented to it by eminent scholars

examples of exactly this kind of protection.

It raises the same question we have

here.

14

MR. STARR:

I don't think so, with all due

15

respect.

I think, and I would urge the Court in

16

considering this entire issue of the protection of symbols

17

-- this isn't just flags.

18

But with respect to the flag, Justice Fortas, the author

19

of the plurality opinion in Brown against Louisiana, the

20

author of the opinion in Tinker against Des Moines School

21

District, a great friend of the First Amendment and of

22

symbolic speech, said in his opinion, his dissenting

23

opinion in Street against New York, the flag is property

24

but only in a sense — it's not like building your own

25

house of worship — because the Nation has an interest in

It's the protection of symbols.

QUESTION:

But let's come back to house of

4

would be constitutional to ban bible burning, an

5

individual burning his own bible?

6

Is it your -- your position that -- that it

MR. STARR:

Well, I think that once we move into

7

the religious area, we are raising other values, namely,

8

values in the establishment clause with respect to how

9

government acts.

The government can protect symbols but

10

it cannot protect symbols in a way that runs afouls —

11

afoul of other provisions of the Constitution.

12

in my judgment — I'm not answering the question

13

authoritatively, but it does seem to me that it clearly

14

raises establishment clause concerns.

15
16

QUESTION:

And there,

We prohibit Torah burning and all

religious symbols that are sacred to any religious group.

17

MR. STARR:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. STARR:

If in fact —
That would be all right?
If it is protecting it not from

20

criticism but from physical destruction or

21

mutilation — that's what we're talking about, physical

22

destruction or mutilation, that one can protect those

23

things that are special to us as a people.

24
25

The fact that the flag is individually owned, in
my judgment, makes the analysis more complicated, but it

does not get us home by any means because, as I was

2

starting to say, what Justice Fortas said is that it is

property even in the hands of a private citizen in a

sense, but only in a sense, because it is property that

comes to us with special restrictions and obligations with

respect to its use.

General Starr, does the record show

the ownership of the flag in these particular cases?
MR. STARR:

In the — yes, the record does.

In

the District of Columbia those were individually owned

flags.

15

have alleged that the flag there was the property of the

Postal Service.

In the Seattle case, in contrast, the flag was

QUESTION:

And in Seattle they were also

18

indicted for destruction of government property, were they

19

not?

20

MR. STARR:

That is exactly right.

Count 1 of

21

the indictment in Seattle charges destruction of

22

government property, and Count 2 of the indictment charges

23

a violation of the Flag Protection Act of 1989.

MR. STARR:

And Count 1 remains pending?

this being on a motion to dismiss.
QUESTION:

2

We don't like, Mr. Starr, to compare

3

our flag with any other flag, but would you be concerned

4

if in Eastern Europe or some foreign country a government

5

punished demonstrators for marching with a defaced flag in

6

support of the demonstrators' cause for freedom?

7

MR. STARR:

I think those are considerations,

8

Justice Kennedy, that are very important for Congress to

9

weigh in the balance.

10

But I would refer the Court to the

Senate —
QUESTION:

11

Well, but isn't the point that this

12

is a recognized — internationally recognized form of

13

protest?

14

MR. STARR:

It certainly, at this particular

15

stage in our history, is affiliated or associated with

16

forms of protest.

17

individuals were engaged in a protest.

18

is the message of the burning of the flag itself is

19

extremely limited, is — we are going to have to have

20

additional context including, here, words.

QUESTION:

We don't deny the fact that these
What we are saying

Well, you can take it two ways.

On

22

the one hand it's limited.

On the other hand it's so

pervasive, so general.

24

was so general, so all-encompassing that it was not worthy

of protection.

Your original argument was that it

Now you're saying that it's very narrow.

1

I not sure which it is.
MR. STARR:

2

I'm sorry.

The protections are very

3

narrow in response to this Court's statements time and

4

again and certainly intimations in opinions of the Court

5

that the physical integrity of the flag could be protected

6

as long as, now with Texas against Johnson, it's done in a

7

viewpoint neutral way.

8

9

One cannot punish a flag protestor because he or
she is expressing outrage about policies to the country.

10

What one can do under this Court's teachings in prior

11

cases and as we read Texas against Johnson in terms of its

12

holding, that Congress does and should have power to

13

protect the physical integrity of the flag as long as it

14

is not saying we single out certain viewpoints for

15

disfavored treatment.

16

Congress was responding to in reading Texas against

17

Johnson and the prior flag cases.
QUESTION:

18

That is the critical point that

But in fact there is only one

19

viewpoint:

trample upon the flag in order to show your love for the

country.

that you do not mutilate, deface, defile or

MR. STARR:

I would urge the Court, before it

came to that view driven by today's newspapers, to read

carefully the Senate's brief, the House of

MR, STARR?

12

QUESTION:

Thank you.

I was afraid I had been demoted.

You started by pointing out to us

13

that Congress had taken out of the original Section 700(a)

14

the phrase "casts contempt upon the flag," but do you

15

really think that in fact there is any difference so long

16

as the words that they describe to protect the physical

17

integrity of the flag are "mutilate, deface, defile, burn

18

or trample" — I guess burn is pretty neutral, but if I

19

Now, I think this is what this Court was getting

at when it spoke of, in Spence against Washington, acts of

mindless nihilism as opposed to the acts that this Court

Mr. Kunstler, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. KUNSTLER

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

8

9
10

Very well, General Starr.

MR. KUNSTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We pose the question somewhat differently than

11

was posed by the government.

12

the Court is can the government criminally prohibit flag

13

burning, a form of political expression deeply critical of

14

the government and anathema to its officials?

15

We think the question before

And I will address three points, and during them

16

respond to some of the points raised by General Starr.

17

We hold, one, that Texas v. Johnson controls

18

these two cases.

19

can simply not be upheld as an attempt to protect the

20

physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances.

21

three, that there is no basis whatsoever to accept the

22

government's invitation to overturn Johnson.

23

Number two, that the Flag Protection Act

And

On the first point, that Texas v. Johnson

24

controls, all parties have conceded that the defendants'

25

conduct below was expressive enough to raise First

1

Amendment concerns, and I do not think there is any

2

argument on that.
Number two, all parties conceded as well that

3
4

the congressional intent behind this statute was to

5

protect the flag as a national symbol, and by definition

6

the governmental interest was only harmed by conduct

7

expressing some message of disrespect or dissent, as

8

indicated by Justice Scalia.

9

was related to the suppression of free expression.

10

In other words, the interest
Ergo,

the strict scrutiny rule applies.
Then lastly, that the government interest in

11
12

preserving this symbolic value is not a compelling

13

interest to justify a criminal penal statute and jail

14

flag-burners.

That is what Johnson held.

15

Now, the Court — I must say to the Court, in

16

rereading what I said last time in the Texas v. Johnson

17

case, I want a little mea culpa.

18

Stevens, I believe, I said that the government had no

19

legitimate interest in enacting any legislation about the

20

flag.

21

Court, of course, did not adopt that argument, and I think

22

rightly so.

23

In responding to Justice

I think I was wrong in that respect, and this

I am persuaded that there are things the

24

government can do with reference to the flag.

25

many things to persuade people to respect it, to fly it,
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

They can do

1

to indicate how it should be flown, to indicate the
dimensions, to indicate the type of flag it should be and

3

how it should appear, and they do that in part under Title

4

36 U.S.C. 173 to 177, but they cannot do it in a penal

5

way.

6

So I express my mean culpa here in response to

7

that question a year ago that Justice Stevens asked of me.

8

They can — they have a legitimate right to regulate the

9

flag, but not under a penal statute.
Now, the government is now arguing, apparently,

11

that there's now a compelling interest that they have in

12

the flag because they passed a new act, because a new act

13

was enacted and became effective on October 28th of last

M

IU

10

year.

15

If the Court were to accept that argument that

16

the mere adoption of a new act would mean that you would

17

reverse yourself in Texas v. Johnson, then I think it

18

would require reversing Marbury against Madison.

19

that's not a sufficient reason, merely because Congress

20

says that it is now enacting a new act in an attempt,

21

direct attempt, to get around Texas v. Johnson.

22

But

And I call the Court's attention that when

23

Johnson was decided there was a prior Federal statute on

24

the books itself.

25

this Court was quite conscious of the prior Section 700 of

They already had enacted an act, and

1

Title 18.
And lastly, maybe stranger than all, even the

3

congressional amici didn't argue for this position at all,

4

only for the application of a more lenient O'Brien

5

standard or time, place and manner standard.

6

cannot change what is obviously the Court's duty in this

7

case merely by passing legislation.
Secondly, with reference to the question of the

8
9

^

physical integrity in all circumstances that are now

claimed by General Starr, this was a claim raised by the

11

congressional amici that it was a content-neutral statute

12

that was enacted here and only to protect the physical

13

integrity of the.flag in all circumstances.

14

obviously that is not true on the face of the statute

itself.

Well, it's

So it is a content-based statute.

It singles

out one particular political symbol, just as in Stromberg

11

the red flag was singled out as one particular political

symbol.
And it is viewpoint-based because it proscribes

14

conduct which was associated with dissent, irrespective of

15

the effect on the physical integrity of the flag. ' It

16

permits, as the Court knows, conduct which shows respect,

You see, General Starr says, essentially, that

11

the burning of a flag by itself carries no message.
