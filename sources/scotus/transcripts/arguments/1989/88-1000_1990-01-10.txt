ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. CODDINGTON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CODDINGTON:

8

9

please the Court:
Your Honor, I know you're all aware of the facts

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

in this case so I'm not going to dwell on them.
Rather, we believe the New York Court of Appeals

12

13

erred on four fronts in this case.

And, if I may, I'd

14

like to concentrate on our first two arguments primarily

15

while I'm at this podium.
We believe that the New York Court of Appeals

16
17

misunderstood Brown and its progeny by holding that a

18

precinct confession, totally voluntary, given outside of a

19

man's house, should be suppressed because the police

20

arrested him in his home without a warrant.
Now, I believe they misapplied Brown.

21

Brown

22

merely holds that Mirandas will not attenuate a Fourth

23

Amendment violation in every case.

24

that Miranda warnings by themselves will not always

25

attenuate.

The opinion says so,

1

However, Brown also did not adopt any "but for"

2

standard -- but for a Fourth Amendment violation a

3

confession so be suppressed.

4

Brown, Taylor and Dunaway, the three cases on

5

which the court of appeals relied, hold merely that when

6

the confession is the product of prolonged involuntary

7

detention without probable cause, then a confession should

8

be suppressed.

9

In those cases, the confession comes as a result

10

of the Fourth Amendment violation.

11

without probable cause in violation of his Fourth

12

Amendment rights.

13

That is, holding a man

Where, however, in a case like this where there

14

is ample probable cause, I submit that the vice that led

15

to the Brown, Dunaway and Taylor holdings is absent.

16

this man was taken outside of his house, the detention was

17

completely lawful for Forth Amendment purposes.

18

Therefore, the perfectly voluntary confession given later

19

at a public place, the police precinct, I submit should

20

have been admissible.

21

Now --

22

QUESTION:

Once

Without regard to any other factors?

23

What I mean is do you agree with what I think is the

24

Solicitor General's position in his brief that the vice of

25

-- going inside the house in this case to arrest the

1

person was that you might have seen things inside the

2

house that could be used as evidence, not the mission to

3

-- to arrest him?

4

MR. CODDINGTON:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And, therefore, so long as you're not

6

using any evidence that you saw inside the house to prove

7

your case, the arrest itself is okay?

8

9
10
11

MR. CODDINGTON:

That's -- that's precisely --

that's my second point, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

We

believe also that the -QUESTION:

Well, but just -- but just on the

12

first point, to follow-up to the Chief Justice's question.

13

If you assume that the rule is you must exclude the

14

statement that's given in the house, then do you make the

15

same argument here?

16

whether or not there's -- the taint's been attenuated?

17

Or is it just a factual inquiry as to

MR. CODDINGTON:

Well, I believe we get into

18

attenuation.

19

position is that if there is probable cause, Miranda

20

warnings by themselves should attenuate and there's no

21

need to go through the three-fold factors.

22

With respect to the Brown holding, my

Okay?

But I also agree that the Payton rule -- I think

23

there should be a bright-line rule here that Payton

24

applies to evidence that is seized or perhaps observed in

25

the home, and that evidence that is taken outside the home

1

should not be suppressed as a violation of Payton.

2

that answers Your Honor's question.
QUESTION:

3
4

So your first point is that probable

cause plus Miranda warnings attenuate without more?
MR. CODDINGTON:

5
6

That's right.

That's right.

And my second --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CODDINGTON:

9

If

And your second point is what?
My second point is that Payton

applies only to evidence seized in the house, and that

10

evidence seized outside the house should not be suppressed

11

under Payton.
QUESTION:

12

13

That's the Solicitor General's

argument.

14

Go back to your first point a minute.

I'm not

15

sure I understood your response to Justice Kennedy.

16

your first point, you would say the first confession in

17

this case is also admissible, wouldn't you?

18
19

MR. CODDINGTON:

Well, if there is a Payton

violation, and as you —
QUESTION:

least for purposes of decision we assume violation, don't

MR. CODDINGTON:

Well, as you know, my fourth

point is that the entry was consensual, and if so, there

would be no Payton violation.

If you — for the moment —

MR. CODDINGTON:

Okay.

Assuming there is a

Payton violation, I believe -- and we've agreed in the

10

state courts -- that the confession in the apartment

probably should be suppressed.

Well, I think Wong Sun answers

Evidence, I believe, of confession.

12

QUESTION:

Wong Sun?

13

MR. CODDINGTON:

Well — that's what this all

14

stems from.

15

makes the point Wong Sun is completely different.

16

Sun was released on his own recognizance by a magistrate.

Actually, in Wong Sun, by the way, the amicus

Yeah.
Which is quite different than

And if we can get over the Payton violation,

However, as I say, that was suppressed by the

QUESTION:

10

So, that's not really a

Did the police have the drawn guns

when they went in there?
MR. CODDINGTON:

11

That's a close question, Your

12

Honor.

The testimony was that one officer had a gun in

13

his pocket; one had a gun down by his leg.

14

was looking through a peep-hole in the door.

think that he ever saw the guns when he opened the door.
QUESTION:

17

The defendant
So I don't

Do you think that was consensual?

Do

you think that to admit somebody with a gun is consensual?
MR. CODDINGTON:

18

If he sees the gun, perhaps

19

not.

But I don't think there is any evidence that this

20

man saw the guns when he opened the door.

21

testified they holstered their guns as soon as they went

22

in.

And the police

When he opened the door — you know, they

They said police.

Okay, let me —

And there was -- there was no reason

at all except the rule.
MR. CODDINGTON:

6

Well, under New York, law, as

7

Your Honor knows -- as Your Honor knows, the police cannot

8

question a defendant without an attorney once they have an

9

arrest warrant.

But as I read these --

10

QUESTION:

There's nothing wrong with that.

11

MR. CODDINGTON:

Well, I have no quarrel with

12

that either.

But there's nothing in any of this Court's

13

decisions that says that the Sixth Amendment requires the

14

police to file charges so the man has an attorney just

15

when they have probable cause.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Coddington, is it the

17

policy then in New York that arrests are made without

18

warrants to avoid that problem?
MR. CODDINGTON:

19
20
21
22

not.
QUESTION:

Well, that certainly is -- is the

argument made in part by the other side.

No, Your Honor, it's not.

It certainly is and --

Do you think that's the custom or

practice in any agencies in New York?

It's

MR. CODDINGTON:

It may have been the custom of

this particular police officer.

of the New York City Police Department.

5

But, as I deal with at

I mean, I'm not going to say that some police

officers don't delay arrests so they can obtain

confessions.

I mean, there's one thing to flagrantly disregard a

constitutional right.

10
11

But I submit that that's perfectly proper.

It's another to tailor your conduct

in conformance with the Constitution.

14

I believe -- touching back to Justice Marshall's

question -- that the police behavior here was not designed

16

to violate the Constitution.

17

which I believe Your Honor wrote, the Court has held that

18

the police do not have to file charges at the moment they

19

have probable cause.

In Hoffa and in Levasco,

The Court has recognized that it is perfectly

20
21

reasonable for police to go to a man's house, knock on the

22

door, and attempt to question him before they make an

23

arrest.

24

the Court knows, reasonableness is the test under which

25

all Fourth Amendment decisions are rendered.

This is perfectly reasonable behavior.

Five days earlier, on the 11th, the police

In addition, they knew on that day, the 11th, where he

The officers were apparently not concerned that
Harris was a threat to anybody else, nor were they

10

concerned that he might flee because between the 11th and

11

the 16th, insofar as the record shows, they made no effort

12

at all to apprehend him.

QUESTION:

1

The Solicitor General in a brief

2

filed in this case suggests that we shouldn't -- we should

3

limit Brown v. Illinois and its rules on attenuation to

4

circumstances of arrests without probable cause.
MR. PARKER:

5

Two things about that, Your Honor.

6

First of all, I do not adopt and I do not believe that

7

what this Court was concerned about in Brown and Dunaway

8

and Taylor were arrests without probable cause.
I believe that in those cases what the Court

9
10

wrestled with was the notion of how best, how most

11

efficiently to deter an illegal arrest.
Arrests can be illegal for a variety of reasons.

12

13

They can be illegal because there is no probable cause.

14

They can be illegal because there happens to be no

15

warrant.
I believe that there is no good policy reason to

16
17

focus on one type of arrest and exclude another type of

18

arrest that because of the circumstances might be more

19

flagrant.

20

-- what it seems to me complicates the cases involving

21

arrests without probable cause is this Court's recognition

22

of the difficulties police officers have in making

23

spontaneous or difficult on-the-spot judgments.

24
25

What you have in the usual circumstance of no

But here we don't have that situation.

This

case, I suggest, is far more flagrant than Dunaway or

Brown.

It --it, I would suggest, creates a substantially

2

more compelling justification for the absence -- excuse

me, for the application of an exclusionary rule than

It was a home arrest.

The officers made no effort to look for him anywhere but

in the home.
And as the New York Court of Appeals found, this

12

series of steps by the police was intended to avoid

13

restrictions on interrogation -- custodial investigation

14

imposed by the New York State Constitution --

15

QUESTION:

Well, why should that interest us,

16

what the New York Constitution imposes on the New York

17

state police officers?

18

MR. PARKER:

Well, I — it — I think it — it

19

adds -- what it does, simply, Your Honor, is it -- it -- I

20

think it makes more plausible the existence of the custom.

21

It indicates why that custom probably arose, and why it is

22

plausible to assume in New York -- to assume, as the court

23

of appeals did in New York, that the custom was followed.

24

QUESTION:

But you're saying is that it rules

out other possible explanations.

MR. PARKER:

QUESTION:

-- other possible explanations.
If the -- if the reasoning behind

5

Payton is that the wrong there is the entry of the home

6

without a warrant, why -- why isn't that wrong

7

satisfactorily compensated for or protected against by

8

simply excluding whatever the police might have seen or

9

seized when they came into the home?
MR. PARKER:

10

It does not do that, Your Honor,

11

because in many instances what the police officers are

12

likely to be looking for when they go to make a Payton --

13

to make an arrest is not simply tangible or testimonial --

14

excuse me — is not simply tangible evidence, but they go,

15

as they did here, to try to get some sort of statement.
And the Solicitor General's approach to the

problem doesn't address that concern.

1

as I take it all of us are trying to figure out exactly

2

what happened here and why it happened, it seems to me the

3

only -- the most logical explanation for why the police

4

did this at home rather than on the street -- if they were

trying to pull something off -- was to get inside the

MR. PARKER:

10

Well, I -- I cannot really fully

11

reconstruct what the thinking of the police officers was

12

here, but if you look at the kind of information they had

13

when they went to his house and what may have been

14

missing, I think it's -- what it looks like they, as we've

15

said, had probable cause but may not have had enough to

16

convict this man.

17

And what they needed was a statement.

after -- based on their experience they thought the best

MR. PARKER:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct, Your Honor.
I believe that the -- the really

principal difference that separates the prosecutor's and

10

our position is whether a Brown attenuation analysis

11

really applies in these circumstances.

12

It's our argument that it certainly does because

13

if the primarily rule of the -- primary thrust of the

14

exclusionary rule is going to be deterrence, stopping a --

15

not applying it to a -- not applying to a situation here

16

where you have an arrest that is -- has been found to be

purposefully flagrant is not going to -- is -- is not

18

going to deter police or eliminate this custom.

In view of the Court's position on consent, I

will not address that.

What --

1

what is attenuated under Brown?

2

of excluding the confession was to exclude something that

3

has been coerced, I could understand that you would look

4

for attenuation of coercive impact.

5
6

7

I -- I -- if the object

But that's not the -- that's not the -- the
object of the exclusion, as I understand it, is it?
MR. PARKER:

I think the object of the exclusion

8

in Brown is to eliminate the incentive to violate the

9

Fourth Amendment.

Brown wrestled -- in addition to

10

wrestling with the issue of how Miranda warnings fit in

11

there, also following Wong Sun and the older cases,

12

wrestled with the -- a notion of where you draw the link

13

following an illegal event in order to bring about

deterrence.

15

QUESTION:

So you think the most significant

factors are how flagrant was the -- was the event which

ought to be sanctioned by the exclusion and -- it's just

sort of strange to refer to that as attenuation.

effect the wrongful action might have had on him?
MR. PARKER:

2

It means that in part, I believe,

3

and that's why it looks to the temporal factors.

4

— it's complicated because I believe this Court's

5

opinions have now indicated that as far -- insofar as

6

attenuation analysis is concerned the most important

7

factor is the flagrancy of the police misconduct.

QUESTION:

But it

Haven't we said that it's not a Fifth

Amendment principle?

10

MR. PARKER:

11

QUESTION:

It's a Fourth Amendment principle.
It's a Fourth Amendment principle so

12

really what we're looking to is not how coerced was the

13

confession.

14

in conceptualizing it as attenuation.

And that's what gives me the difficulty in --

MR. PARKER:

15

Well, I — I realize that the —

16

that there are gray areas around these principles, but I

17

think that in terms of setting doctrine that courts can

18

apply and have now experience with applying and are

19

comfortable with applying, the attenuation analysis seems

20

to be working.

21

here -- in this case that it's not.

There is no indication here, in the record

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Mr. Parker, can I ask you -- are you

3

through? -- another question about New York law that I'm

4

just not entirely clear on?

5

This rule about the accusatory instrument makes

6

it impermissible to question the suspect without a lawyer

7

until a lawyer is -- and he can't waive that right except

8

in the presence of a lawyer which, as I understand it, is

9

a holding in your Samuels case in 1980.

10

Was that the law prior to Samuels?

11

MR. PARKER:

12

QUESTION:

Oh, I -Is this an old New York rule or is

13

this kind of a by-product of Payton is what I'm really

14

asking, I suppose.

15

MR. PARKER:

Now, I believe this body of law

16

existed before Payton.

17

I believe the mid to early '60s.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PARKER:

It went back to some decisions in

And, of course, when Payton came

20

along the body of law imposing the restrictions was

21

suddenly confronted with this new element, this

22

requirement that this Court set in Payton.

23

I think what is significant there is that

24

following Payton the legislature was asked to reconsider

predicate to an arrest warrant.

And the argument was made

2

that some difficulties might be created -- some

3

difficulties had been created because of this Court's

4

Payton decision, and the legislature rejected it.
So here we have a case where the New York

legislature — it's not -- of course, the legislative

7

history is not as complete as you would have for a

8

congressional action.

the legislature in New York was aware of this position --
