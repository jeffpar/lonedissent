ORAL ARGUMENT OF LUCIEN B. CAMPBELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CAMPBELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case calls upon this Court to interpret the

11

reach of a criminal statute, the restitution provision of

12

the Victim and Witness Protection Act of VWPA.

13

case, the Petitioner was charged with offenses of

14

embezzlement of mail and fraudulent use of credit cards.

15

In this

Pursuant to a plea agreement which was silent as

16

to restitution, he entered a plea of guilty to count 4

17

only of the indictment.

18

that on or about October 18, 1985 he fraudulently used a

19

credit card issued by MBank to one Hershey Godfrey and

20

thereby caused losses aggregating more than $1,000.

21

Count 4 of the indictment charged

In the interim, between his plea of guilty and

22

the sentencing hearing, he received notice from the

23

probation service of the court that it was proposing a

24

restitution order far in excess of losses on the count of

25

conviction.

He filed a timely written objection to that

1
2

notice, pursuant to local procedure.

At the sentencing

3

hearing information presented was that the total losses on

4

the Godfrey credit card, which was the subject of the

5

count of conviction, was about $10,000, speaking in round

6

numbers, and the issuing bank, MBank, suffered overall

7

losses of about $90,000.
Over the Petitioner's renewed objection that

8

9

such a restitution order would exceed both the limits of

10

the law, and his ability to pay, the court sentenced him

11

to pay $90,000 in restitution within five years after

12

expiration of an eight-year term of imprisonment.

13

Now, in this case we turn first, as we expect

14

the Court will, to the plain language of the statute.

MR. CAMPBELL:

-- order of restitution, provides

2

that the court when sentencing a defendant convicted of an

3

offense, and the language pertinent to this case is "may

4

order that the defendant make restitution to any victim of

5

such offense."

6

Now, this part says who pays — the defendant,

7

and who receives — a victim of such offense.

8

Respondent has agreed with us that that language means a

9

victim of the offense of conviction in 3579(a)(1).

10

Now, going forward in the statute —

QUESTION:

next to 3579(b).

property loss.

2

resulting in loss of property of a victim of the offense,

3

the order may require that such defendant return the

4

property to the owner of the property or pay the value of

5

the property.

6

It provides that in the case of an offense

Now, because they is simply nothing to suggest

7

that the meaning of the term "the offense" shifts in some

8

way in the statute from subsection to another, we say that

9

3579(b)(1) authorizes the court to order return of the

10

property taken in the offense, and does not authorize

11

anything more than that.

12

Now, the government relies in large measure on

13

Section 3580(a), reproduced at appendix pages A-4 and A-5

14

in our brief.

15

it supports our reading of this statute.

16

court shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by

17

any victim as a result of the offense.

18

nothing to indicate that the offense means anything

19

different from what it meant back in 3579.

20

We rely on it also because we believe that
It says that the

Here again, with

Now, the government would argue that the

21

catchall language at the end of 3580(a) must mean that the

22

court has authority to order restitution beyond the

23

offense of conviction.

24

the court shall consider loss sustained by the victim as a

25

result of the offense, certain factors bearing on the

What this section does is say that

defendant's ability to pay and such other factors as the
court deems appropriate.
I think I should respond to this because the
government places considerable reliance on that catchall
phrase in 3588 expanding the plain language of 3579.
I would note, first, that 3580 is a procedural
section.

It is so titled, it's called Procedure for

Issuing Order of Restitution.
procedural.

Its content is largely

By its terms, I believe it applies only after

the court has decided that restitution is already covered
under Section 3579, the section that is more substantive.
It says page A-4), "the court, in determining
whether the order restitution under Section 3579 of this
title, and the amount of such restitution."

I believe

this means that unless the court has already determined
that restitution is covered under Section 3579, then the
court does not reach 3580(a).
Now, I think it's also significant that the
government is asking a general catchall phrase to expand
other specific provisions of the statute.

We say that

3579(b) — (b)(1) property loss, is very specific in
authorizing the remedy in the case of an offense resulting
in loss of property, to return that property or pay its
value.

And it simply cannot be the duty that the

government would assign to it of expanding a specific

1

provision.

2

Now, while the statute has no —

3

QUESTION:

Can't you also derive some comfort

4

from the ejusdem generis rule, or the noscitur a sociis —

5

whatever you want to call it — that the catchall phrase

6

does not — is thought to be limited to the same types of

7

things that the earlier parts of the clause are contained?
MR. CAMPBELL:

8

9

rely on that rule.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

We do

It would first be taken to refer to

10

items of the same character in the list which precede it.

11

That is, the loss sustained by the victim of the offense

12

and factors bearing on the defendant's ability to pay.

13

But even if it is read to have more general

14

application beyond that list in which it appears, then we

15

say that it applies to the authority expressly conferred

16

in this statute to order partial restitution or no

17

restitution.

18

cannot support the government's meaning of expanding

19

authority.

20

Appendix Page A-l, which says that if the court does not

21

order restitution or orders only partial restitution, the

22

court shall state the reasons.

23

And because it so clearly refers to that, it

And I'm referring back to 3579(a)(2) on

So this statute specifically contemplates that

24

in a proper case a court may order only partial

25

restitution or no restitution.

QUESTION:

1
2

Mr. Campbell, what — what if the

charge were of a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud?
MR. CAMPBELL:

3

Your Honor, that is the rule that

4

the Ninth Circuit seems to have adopted, and throughout

5

this case we have not challenged that rule because we

6

don't believe that it applies to this case.

7

QUESTION:

8

would your view be about that?

9

MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, I — I — it may not.

What

I can — I can —

Then does that broaden the range of

possible victims and amounts of restitution?

12

MR. CAMPBELL:

It certainly would have that

13

practical effect, Justice O'Connor, but I —■ I see some

14

support to that rule because I can certainly can

15

understand that in an offense such as mail fraud, a

16

particular scheme to defraud is an element of that

17

defense.

18

for example, that person must be proven guilty of that

19

larger scheme.

And for a person to stand guilty of mail fraud,

20
21

So, we have not challenged that rule, and I see
some support for it.

22

QUESTION:

Do you suppose that a defendant could

23

agree to pay a larger sum of restitution than you would

24

argue for in this case if — if it had been part of a plea

25

agreement?

MR. CAMPBELL:

1

A defendant may certainly agree

2

to do that, Justice O'Connor.

seems to ascent that there's no admissions exception.

4

courts -- the courts of appeals have frequently applied

5

such an exception.

QUESTION:

MR. CAMPBELL:

The

There is no doubt that it could be

We note that the respondent

Uh-huh.
And Respondent alludes to that in

In other words, if a defendant entered into

10

a plea agreement calling for him to make total restitution

11

beyond the offense of conviction and willfully failed to

12

follow through on that plea agreement, he would be a peril

13

of the government reinstating dismissed counts, for

14

example.

15

So even if there is no admissions exception that

16

would make such an order of restitution fully enforceable

17

under this statute, it is certainly enforceable in other

18

ways .

19

QUESTION:

Could — could — could the court

20

order payment for these other counts, maybe even to other

21

banks as a condition of probation?

22

MR. CAMPBELL:

Your Honor, the courts are not

23

clear over whether the old Federal Probation Act continued

24

in effect after the enactment of the Victim and Witness

25

Protection Act.

In other words, during the period of time

it's clear from the statute as a whole that there may be

MR. CAMPBELL:

That's certainly correct.

In our

12

further interpretation of Section 3580(a) we believe that

13

instead of expanding the substantive reach of this statute

14

it would reach other factors that the court would consider

15

in deciding whether to order partial restitution or no

16

restitution.

17

And two of those that I see are specifically

18

mentioned in the statute.

19

says that if the court finds that it would unduly

20

complicate or prolong the sentencing proceeding to fashion

21

an order of restitution, the court may order no

might consider.

shall not impose restitution for a loss for which the

1

victim has received or is to receive compensation, except

2

that in the interest of justice the court may order

3

restitution to the person compensating, thus, introducing

4

a new test — interest of justice.

5

In addition, this is not a statutory factor, but

6

an obvious factor, is that in a multi-defendant case I can

7

certainly imagine the court considering how to apportion

8

restitution.

9

apportion it on relative ability to pay, relative

10

In other words, considering whether to

culpability, relative gain or some combination of factors.

11

And all of these are factors that the court

12

might well consider under 3580(a) that go to imposing

13

partial or no restitution, and have nothing to do with

14

imposing restitution beyond the count of conviction.

15

So, I simply don't see how the catchall can

16

carry the burden that the government would assign to it.

17

This is a case where we suggest that the unambiguous

18

language of the statute limits restitution to the offense

19

of conviction and the Court should so hold.

20

Now, if the Court should find some ambiguity,

21

then it would be proper to resort to customary rules of

22

statutory construction.

23

Turning first to the legislative history, I

24

believe that the Court will find an extraordinarily

25

explicit record that directly supports the petitioner's

MR. CAMPBELL:

The relevance that I see, Mr.

Chief Justice, is that the language is functionally

identical to what Congress ultimately passed in 1982 in

MR. CAMPBELL:

this case but prior to sentencing in this case.

substantive change was intended by that amendment.

No

17

change in the meaning of the statute was intended.

So I

18

see no reason why the congressional intent cannot be --

19

cannot be given effect.

QUESTION:

And if there is no difference in the

21

meaning -- between such and the, then it's immaterial

We believe that

1

the meaning is the same in 1982 and 1986, and under either

version the result needs to be the same in this case.

only significance would be the weight to be given to the

legislative history of the 1986 Amendment.

5

The

So, to — to recap briefly this legislative

6

history, for the better part of this century, since the

7

Federal Probation Act of 1925, Congress had said that

8

restitution is limited to the offense of conviction.

9

The forerunner, a progenitor of this law in

10

1980, Congress said that functionally identical language

11

to what was eventually passed would so limit restitution.

12

When Congress passed the VWPA, it said we have expanded

13

restitution beyond conditions of probation.

14

say we have expanded restitution beyond the offense of

15

conviction.

16

1986 to make it abundantly clear that the offense means

17

the offense of conviction.

18

It did not

And, finally Congress amended this law in

I believe that where the legislative intent is

so plainly expressed, and especially where it is

20

consistent with the plain language of the statute, the

21

petitioner's right to relief is — is clear.

QUESTION:

If —

Mr. Campbell, may I ask one -- one

amount specified in the indictment?

1

I — I certainly agree with that,

2

Justice Stevens, because the statute contemplates that

3

there are certain covered losses that are not going to be

4

part of the indictment, such as therapy of a victim, such

5

as lost income in the case of bodily injury.

6

And I think some of the court's went astray and

7

seeing that necessarily they were going to have to look

8

outside the indictment to find some of the covered losses

9

that induced them to look further outside the indictment,

MR. CAMPBELL:

further than what the language would bear.
QUESTION:

But you'd agree, even as strict

12

property law case there was a robbery of a hundred — an

13

alleged robbery of $1,000 and the evidence shows it's

14

really $1,500, they could recover the full $1,500?

15

MR. CAMPBELL:

Provided that it's supported by

16

conviction for that offense.

17

that we took in this case where the government alleged

18

only the jurisdictional amount, alleged an amount — an

19

amount aggregating more than $1,000.

20

proposed a restitution order of $10,000, all of the losses

on the Hershey Godfrey credit card as being fairly within

22

the compass of this statute.

here to find out what happened to the limitation that the

old Federal Probation Act had, but — but to look at this

statute and see what does it expressly authorize, because

4

when we are speaking of criminal penalties for criminal

offenses it is a question of what has the Congress

expressly authorized.

7

Where the court of appeals found an ambiguity in

this language it erred by interpreting the statute

expansively against the individual.

The court of appeals

10

did not even address or recognize the effect of rule of

lenity and in — in its decision.
But this Court has said on many occasions that

13

when it's called upon to choose between two possible

meanings of criminal statute, it will require that

Congress speak clearly and distinctly before — before

it please the Court:
MS. WAX:

2

The question presented in this case is

3

whether under the Victim and Witness Protection Act of

4

1982 a defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to

5

an offense may be sentenced to pay restitution for damage

6

caused by acts for which -he has not been found guilty.

7

The answer, we submit, is yes.

The Victim and

8

Witness Protection, the VWPA, which authorizes a court to

9

order restitution to any victim of the offense of which a

10

defendant is convicted, mandates full and fair restitution

11

to that victim, restitution that reflects a realistic

12

assessment of the harm to the victim caused by the

13

defendant.

14

Thus, as virtually every lower court to consider

15

the question has held the amount of restitution the

16

defendant may be ordered to pay is not limited to the

17

particular loss from the narrow count of conviction.

18

the courts were limited to considering only that loss,

19

full and fair restitution to victims of crime would often

20

be impossible.

21

QUESTION:

If

Well, Ms. Wax, certainly the language

22

of the statute seems to tie the amount of restitution to

23

the harm resulting from the offense of conviction.

there is a way to interpret each of these provisions which

QUESTION:

construction comes into play.

MS. WAX:

9

the amount of restitution to the —

10
11

12

QUESTION:

No, but it appears to be tied to the

harm resulting from the offense of conviction.
MS. WAX:

Well, let me, if I may, go through

13

each of these provisions one by one and give our version

14

of why these provisions were structured and written as

15

they are written and what Congress was attempting to

16

accomplish with — with — with these sections.

17

First, starting with 3580(a) and (d) which

18

Petitioner basically relies on in his opening brief.

19

3580(a) we see has a two-part structure.

20

the court in determining whether to order restitution

21

shall — and the amount of such restitution — shall

22

consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as

23

a result of the offense.

24

such other factors as the courts deem appropriate."

25

It first says,

And then it goes on to say,

"and

mandatory terms.

It tells the sentencing court what it

shall consider.

3

resulting from the — the offense, which we maintain is

4

only part of what — which are only some of the acts the

5

court can consider — can consider.

And it specifies the amount of loss

It's appropriate that in speaking in mandatory

6
7

terms the provision alludes specifically to the loss

8

resulting from the offense because that is going to form

9

the centerpiece of the vast majority of restitution

10

orders, if only because there will always be an offense of

11

conviction, and most of the time it's the offense of

12

conviction which will cause the harm.

13

There may be many cases in which there is no

14

other significant harm to the victim.

15

where the — the count of conviction encompasses all of

16

the damage done to victims and there's nothing more to

17

consider.

18

There may be cases

Now, it's also appropriate that the damage

19

caused by any related acts of the defendant be subsumed or

20

covered under the catchall phrase "and such other factors

MS. WAX:

Well, actually not because one of the

things that we think comes under that phrase is quite

parallel to what the court -- to what the provision

mentions in the very first section.

with harms from the defendant's acts, both of them deal

with loss to the victim from the defendant's acts.

just that the first part deals with the core of the

MS. WAX:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

Petitioner in a sense cast the first stone in this because

10

he did rely on 3580(a) and (d) as evincing a substantive

11

limit on the amount of restitution.

12

two procedural provisions can fully be squared with the

13

absence of a substantive limit, and we think that there is

14

no substantive limit in 3579.

We think that those

15

The core of the authorization to grant restitute

16

— to award restitution to victims is in 3579(a)(1), where

17

the court says when sentencing a defendant convicted of a

18

offense, the court may order restitution to any victim of

19

the offense.

20

saying that that limited the amount of restitution, he now

And so this provision solves the

Ms. Wax, what — what also suggests

to me that 79(b) is — is exclusive and sets forth the

there could be to a victim.

Okay.

We think it leaves open the possibility of

What is your — what is the limit?

16

Is there some outside limit on what compensation you think

can — can be ordered?

18

MS. WAX:

How would you describe it?

Well, there are two answers to that.

19

We do think there are limits, yes.

20

the sentencing court has unlimited discretion —

QUESTION:

We don't think that

It seems to me you'd certainly leave

a — a judge — a judge has a duty under (a)(2) that if he

doesn't order restitution or orders only partial

Right.

MS. WAX:

QUESTION:

6

7

Well —
— which seems to be so — be so

open- ended that — you tell me what their limits are?
MS. WAX:

Right.

Well, there are three possible

8

sources of limitation.

One is that Congress in its wisdom

9

incorporated the limitation that it has to be harm to the

10

victim of the offense.

11

QUESTION:

13

MS. WAX:

So, there are certain victims that

Oh, I understand that.
— there are certain that are going to

be left out.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

But you

just say —

17

MS. WAX:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. WAX:

Secondly —
— it doesn't say how much.
Right.

The second limitation — and

20

here is in the concept of restitution itself.

It has to

21

be an order of restitution.

22

there should be some linkage, some relationship, between

23

the conduct of the defendant that's taken into account,

24

the related conduct.

25

that conduct and the actual offense of conviction.

And that means that there —

There has to be some unity between

1

So an act by the defendant that harms the victim

2

which is remote — extremely remote in time or has no

3

clear connection to the episode or the ongoing course of

4

conduct of which the count of conviction is a part would

5

probably be inappropriate.

6

the judge to include that in the order of restitution, and

7

it could well be an abuse of discretion.

8
9

It would be inappropriate for

And to understand that, one needs to look at the
purposes of restitution and the nature of restitution.

10

The purposes of restitution, as with other criminal

11

sanctions, are deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation.

12

And it is abundantly obvious that, for example,

13

restitution for a mere fraction of the harm that the

14

defendant actually did to the victim would not adequately

15

serve those purposes.

16

But the flip side of that is that restitution

17

for very remote or unrelated harms would not really add to

18

the power and the value of the sanction of restitution for

19

this crime.

20

QUESTION:

Of course, one of the collateral

21

effects of your argument — there are other banks here.

22

And the MBank I believe, which was the one that got the

restitution order, in effect may have gotten all this

And that's a collateral effect of what you

I recognize no one argues you can give

restitution to other victims.

7

effect of what your arguing here.

8

9

MS. WAX:

But that's a collateral

There's no doubt that in the practical

application of this statute, as Congress wrote it, there

10

are victims who are going to lose out.

I mean, if —■ if

11

the pattern of a certain crime is multiple instances of

12

violations directed at many, many different victims, which

13

sometimes happens, for example, with mail fraud counts,

14

then the fact is that there's not going to be terribly

15

effective restitution to the mass of victims if the

16

conviction is limited to one count.

17

Congress structured the Act this way.

18

it had good and sensible reasons for doing it because it

19

does create boundaries, it does cabin the sentencing

20

court's discretion in a way that is — makes a lot of

21

sense for restitution, which is about the relationship

22

between the victim and the defendant and the confrontation

23

between the victim and defendant and measures whereby the

24

defendant makes the victim whole.

25

We think

speaking of and it is a concern but this is the way

2

Congress wrote the statute, in our opinion.
I was speaking of the general provisions of the

3
4

statute which in our view buttress our reading of the

5

statute as permitting the sentencing judge under

6

appropriate circumstances to go beyond the offense of

7

conviction to look at the harm done by the defendant to

8

the victim.

9

And, as I said, there were three provisions of

10

the statute which we believe can be read to mandate full

11

and fair restitution and to show that restitution confined

12

to the count of conviction could not possibly fulfill

13

Congress'"purposes in enacting --

14

QUESTION:

Could I just make one — one

16

read in such and such a way.

17

sort of a duty of fair notice to the defendant that they

18

— they must be read this way when you're ordering

restitution of nine time the amount that was specified in

20

the event?

21

You repeatedly said these provisions can be

The mere fact that a statute can be read to

support this kind of result, is that — is that — do you

putting it.

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. WAX:

I don't think it is.
We think it must be read because of

4

what Congress was trying to accomplish with this statute

5

and because the reading that Petitioner urges would so

6

eviscerate the efficacy of these restitution provisions

7

that we just can't believe that this is the way Congress

8

meant for them to be interpreted.

9

And we're not just saying that out of thin air.

10

We think that that impulse finds substantiation in

11

particular provisions of the statute, which admittedly

12

some — some of which speak in general terms, but which we

13

think show Congress' intent.

14

QUESTION:

If you lose this case, it seems to me

15

that government can always protect itself against too

16

narrow a restitution order.

17

arrangement you can bargain about restitution.

18

MS. WAX:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. WAX:

In your plea bargaining

Your Honor, we don't think so.
Why not?
First of all, it's true that we could

21

attempt to elicit a promise from the defendant that they

22

pay comprehensive restitution flowing from all the counts

23

that we think they are guilty of in the process of

hammering out a plea agreement on a very narrow count.

The fact is that victims will suffer, and

11

12

defendants will go scot free.

13

QUESTION:

They will not —

Well, Ms. Wax, this looks a case

14

where the government entered into a very poor plea

15

agreement from the standpoint of public policy.

16

would think a prosecutor would want to be a little careful

17

before entering into such a limited agreement with someone

18

who has caused so much harm or been privy to much broader

19

activity than that encompassed in the plea agreement.

And I

20

Now, I guess you would agree that the prosecutor

21

doesn't have to accept a limited plea bargain like this or

22

go along with it.

23

MS. WAX:

That's correct.

doesn't.

more or less comports with our view of the kind of penalty

And we don't think -- we think Congress was

We think it does help our case and so

20

did the court below, Your Honor, because in saying the

offense involving the acts giving rise to restitution,

22

that provision implies that there might be acts giving

rise to restitution that are not part of the offense.

implying a more expansive view of the statute.
