ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

11

Our narrowest argument assumes that, in

12

circumstances like this case, Indian tribes do have the

13

legislative jurisdiction to subject nonmembers to tribal

14

tort law duties.

15

Respondents argue that the same facts also

16

give Indian tribes the mandatory adjudicatory

17

jurisdiction to decide private tort lawsuits against

18

non­Indians.

19

Tribes entered the United States and were incorporated

20

into this country, their power to adjudicate cases in

21

this fashion was understood to be an element of their

22

sovereignty.

23

Respondents' theory is that, when the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, everyone

agrees that the Tribes have a form of adjudicatory

authority upon consent.

2

The question is going to be:

3

They don't have it inherently.
What qualifies as consent?

Our point is that, in three separate

4

respects, the national tradition of the United States

5

and our Constitution does not contemplate that a

6

sovereign would adjudicate cases in this fashion.

7

want to briefly identify the three, if I could.

8
9

And I

First, the Constitution contemplates the
availability of a neutral forum for suits against

10

noncitizens, and by analogy, noncitizens as you say,

11

Justice Ginsburg, have always been able to remove a case

12

from State to Federal court.

13

The United States at the time of

14

incorporation could not have accepted that non­Indians

15

would not be able to remove to a neutral forum.

16

Second, the Constitution contemplates that

17

this Court will be the one Supreme Court, and State

18

court rulings on questions of Federal law have, of

19

course, always been reviewable in this Court.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I ­­ I don't ­­ this

21

is an important part of the dialogue, but let me just go

22

back to the first part of ­­ of ­­ of your response.

23

Is ­­ is it black­letter law given the

24

25

non­Tribe members on ­­ for ­­ for regulatory purposes?

Alderson Reporting Company

I ­­ I ­­ I take it that as a black­letter law given?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Kennedy, if we say

3

it ­­ in those terms, regulatory authority without

4

getting into the question of all forms of legislation,

5

for example, tort law, then the first exception to

6

Montana says that, although there is a presumption

7

against jurisdiction, the Tribes do have their

8

regulatory authority.

9

We have the argument that tort law, because

10

it is so broad and would swallow the rule, that the

11

Tribes lack legislative authority over nonmembers.

12

have the argument that that is not within the

13

legislative jurisdiction.

What I had said at the beginning ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

with what the Court said in Strate?

authority to regulate the activity of nonmembers, civil

to my question ­­

Because

if what you're arguing now is correct, Strate would have

15

been a one­line decision:

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No tort jurisdiction over a

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's

18

true that this Court's decisions can often be resolved

19

in different ways.

20

addressing this question explains is that what the Court

21

has done is narrowly identify the legislative

22

jurisdiction of the Tribe in the cases before it.

23

so in Strate and in other cases, it has held that the

24

Tribe lacked that antecedent legislative authority.

25

on that basis, concluded that, well, then because the

opinion of the Court was just wrong?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, what the

Court has said in Nevada v. Hicks, addressing the

11

various times that there is dictum in the Court's

12

opinions that has assumed the parallel between

13

legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction is that that

question had not been fully considered by the Court and

15

it remained open.

18

whether there also is adjudicatory jurisdiction.

To

And I'm pleased to explain why it is.

And

20

what I ­­ my introduction was trying to do was, assuming

21

the antecedent legislative jurisdiction, here's why you

22

don't have jurisdiction to decide a court case in this

23

fashion.

24
25

So the first one that I gave you was the
availability of a neutral forum as anticipated by the

Constitution.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I address that for a

moment?

4

States appoint judges.

Sometimes they're

elected, but often they're appointed.

7

citizen there.

8

judges are neutral.

We don't think it

We think of it as neutral because the

You're just assuming that these judges are
not neutral.

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Oh, Justice Sotomayor, I

12

think actually that your hypothetical is a good one for

13

us.

14

In Article III of the Constitution, we

15

contemplate the availability of a neutral forum when a

16

noncitizen is a defendant in the case, including when

17

we, you know, ordinarily respect the neutrality of State

forth from every other court in the country, and maybe

there's some where that isn't true.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And my point is that Congress could not

Two things.

I want to say that there are some

For example, we have a Federal claim against

case, and that would be entirely unreviewable in this

12

case.

13

Now, you contemplate the prospect that we

14

would collaterally attack the judgment.

15

about that.

16

A few things

The first is, if that's going to be serious,

if we are really going to have a serious regime of

18

collateral attacks where you would just assess whether

19

or not the tribal court ruling is consistent with due

21

22

could be overturned by a circuit court in Mississippi.

23

We wouldn't say that that was an actual sovereign

ruling.

4

What the Federal courts have done is afford

5

courts or foreign courts that are way out of bounds.

7

point is that the rule that's contemplated by the

Constitution is not one of being way out of bounds, it

9

is simply that we have a right to due process; that this

10

Court will be the Supreme Court, that the Constitution

11

is the supreme law of the land.

13

best­managed, most modern courts, when those rules

simply don't apply, that is not consistent ­­

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

19

rule of the Constitution is not "close is good enough,"

20

but I will say that I think the Indian Civil Rights Act

21

is a point in our favor.

22

that Congress has left to the Tribes.

5

belongs to the Tribes.

It has not treated

It's quite different.

The United States obviously did not regard

the Tribes' judiciary as something that is purely a part

of their government, because time and again, it has

And, Justice Breyer, I do want to point out

11

another example of that, and that is the Violence

12

Against Women Act.

13

this, and that Congress has developed systems that say

14

if this tribal judiciary is a good one which affords due

15

process, then it has jurisdiction over cases.

There, we see the right way of doing

16

And we think that's the right approach here.

You can do it both ways.

And there are books, some of which I have at least

looked through, and certainly articles that suggest that

the tribal courts function perfectly well, certainly in

24

many places.

25

Now, I take it your argument is that there

Alderson Reporting Company

are some places they don't function well, and in respect

2

to matters that are not matters of Federal law, there

3

won't be review from those courts unless you

4

collaterally attack them.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Is that your point?

system like this one.

from being people who know the plaintiff.

21

Now with respect to other judiciaries, it is

22

the case that we do recognize, and the United States has

23

recognized, a wide swath of tribes that use more

traditional dispute­resolution mechanisms that also

already, why not?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

Justice Breyer, I do

12

think your hypothetical of a contract is a really good

13

one for us, because we do believe that the Respondents

14

are most concerned, and their best facts are a business

15

like this one, to be honest, that's operating on tribal

16

land, in the Reservation on an ongoing basis, and they

My point is that in these circumstances,

21

what the Tribes do is, as a condition of operating on

24

Let me

And the analogy here is that when a State

19

sues a noncitizen, that is an act of the sovereign and

20

it is not removable, because what Montana is concerned

21

with, what this Court's precedents are concerned with,

22

is the exercise of sovereign authority in the pursuit of

23

self­governance.

24
25

This is not a sovereign action.

This is a

private suit between two individuals, and so it is

important that if the Tribe is exercising its sovereign

2

authority, bringing a civil enforcement action against

3

us, for example, that would have presented ­­ present a

4

very different question, because it would be

It has never been understood that ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if the Tribe brought

7

this suit, instead of the parents of the boy who was

8

molested, if ­­ if it ­­ then it would be okay?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, we think that's an

10

impossibility.

11

explanation ­­ although there aren't any citations; it's

12

hard to know what the tort law is ­­ the other side's

13

explanation is that tort law of the Tribe tracks

14

Mississippi tort law, and there isn't a situation in

15

which the Tribe could bring such an action.

16

if it was a parens patriae action, we would still regard

17

it as in the interest of the individual.

18

Remember that the other side's

And I think

I'm thinking instead, Justice Ginsburg, of

19

take the follow­on to what Montana describes, that is, a

20

licensing regulation or a taxation regulation.

21

believe that if the Tribe went into tribal court to

22

enforce those measures, that would be a sovereign action

23

and it would be susceptible of the Montana exception.

24

The difference is when the Tribe is not a

25

party here.

We

We don't deny that there is some sovereign

interest.

2

this adjudication.

3

Okay.

There is some sovereign interest in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's a bit of an odd

4

argument, isn't it, Mr. Goldstein, that there's less of

5

a sovereign interest in protecting your own citizens

6

than in enforcing your licensing laws?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If that were our argument,

8

it would be an odd one.

What we say is that you have a

9

very different regime.

If you have a legal regime that

10

said here is a duty towards our noncitizen, our ­­ our

11

tribal members or just individuals on the Reservation,

12

and if you violate that, here are a set of fines, you

13

will be excluded from the Reservation, then that would

14

be an act of the sovereign.

15

So our point isn't just it's the nature of

16

this ­­ you know, this is a very serious allegation that

17

we take very seriously about a minor child, a member of

18

the Tribe.

19

saying, well, that's less important than taxation or a

20

hunting license.

21

I am not demeaning that in any way and

Not at all.

My point is that you are being asked that at

22

the time the Tribes came into the United States, was a

23

private suit against a nonmember regarded as an

24

incidence of sovereignty, could the Congress of the

25

United States, when the States didn't have this

citizens?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We think not, and let me

explain the reason.

16

know, the Federal government would be passing a law

17

essentially shunting the jurisdiction over an

18

individual's matter into another adjudicative system.

That would be State action.

11

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that you haven't

this Court unanimously, in Strate, said that when tribes

MR. KATYAL:

Well, Justice ­­ Justice

Scalia, I think everything about this Court's precedents

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

in this area, which are all tort cases, lead to that

2

conclusion.

3

Mr. Goldstein's best argument is Hicks.

But

4

remember in Hicks, the Court went out of its way to say

5

that the claims in El Paso, which were very similar to

6

the claims here ­­ it was a nonmember business doing

7

business on tribal land.

8

did this Court say, citing to footnote 4 of El Paso?

9

There is little doubt there was jurisdiction in that

11

It was a tort lawsuit ­­ what

case.
So yes, I understand that they are dicta,

12

but it is dicta of the most persuasive sort.

13

unbroken rule of this Court, frankly, that in all of

14

these cases, this Court has said there is presumptively

15

jurisdiction.

16

It is the

And indeed, the exhaustion cases would make

17

no sense otherwise because twice this Court said, in

18

tort cases, in Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union,

19

this Court said you've got to go to tribal court and

20

exhaust your remedies.

21

And Justice Scalia, if the rule in those

22

cases was, hey, tribal courts don't have jurisdiction,

23

they would have done what you did in your opinion in

24

Hicks, because at page 369 you said, quote, "Since it's

25

clear tribal courts lack jurisdiction over State

requirement would serve no purpose."

Well, on tribal land we do

9

think ­­ we don't think you have to go as far as the

10

Solicitor General to say it's absolutely 100 percent

11

dispositive, but we do think this Court has recognized

12

in Merrion and El Paso that when you're on tribal lands,

13

the tribe's powers are at their zenith.

Well, I'm trying to

understand the limits of your ­­ of your argument.
So what would happen in this situation?

A

17

tribe ­­ a member of the Tribe purchases a product

18

online from a nonmember company, and the product is

19

delivered to the Tribal member on tribal land.

20

delivery person gets involved in a traffic accident or

21

some other dispute in the course of delivering the

22

product, and the product itself injures the person who

purchased it.

The

So could the ­­ the person who got into ­­

2

Could the person who ­­ the tribal member

3

who purchased the product bring a products liability

4

action against the manufacturer in tribal court?

MR. KATYAL:

It depends a little bit more on

6

the facts.

7

you need a consensual relationship with someone on the

Tribe ­­ on tribal land.

9

extent that that delivery service was operated by, you

10

know, by the nonmember and that they're actually doing

the delivery, absolutely.

12

delivery and the injury.

13

In general, what this Court has said is that

And so, you know, to the

There's a nexus between the

Now, if it was some exotic tort, so for

14

example it's the delivery truck comes onto tribal land,

15

and unbeknownst to them there's some unusual tradition

16

that says delivery trucks have to be painted, you know,

17

some other color or something like that that they don't

18

know about, I think this Court's decision in Plains

19

Commerce Bank says that's not what you're reasonably

authority Congress has to subject citizens of the

United States to that nonconstitutional forum.

14

MR. KATYAL:

It's exactly what this Court ­­

15

and Justice Kennedy joined this in Plains Commerce

17

are these constitutional concerns that ­­ or that tribes

takes it out of that circumstance.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

10
11
12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like at the outset to respond to the

13

argument that tribal court jurisdiction over tort claims

14

is somehow inconsistent with the superior sovereignty of

15

the United States.

16

That argument was flatly rejected, I think,

17

in both National Farmers Union and Iowa Mutual where

18

this Court was asked to apply the rule of Oliphant to

19

civil jurisdiction.

20

decision joined by Justice Rehnquist, who was the author

21

of Oliphant, said that those principles do not apply to

22

civil jurisdiction.

Union enforced the rule of exhaustion on that premise.

connection with the passage in 1993, as we explain in

3

Tribal Justice Act.

4

that statute, Congress made two specific findings:

5

Tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal

6

government and serve important forums for ensuring

7

public health and safety and political integrity of the

8

Tribe, and Congress in Federal courts ­­

9

It held hearings, and in that ­­ in

MR. KNEEDLER:

If I could finish, what

15

Congress and Federal courts have repeatedly recognized

16

tribal justice systems as the appropriate forums for the

17

adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property

18

rights.

19

The committee reports on that statute made

20

clear that they ­­ that those provisions were enacted in

21

light of Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union, and in

22

fact, one of the ­­ one of the committee reports says

23

that that second provision was added in recognition of

24

the jurisdiction that tribal courts have over

25

non­Indian ­­

7

it was enacted in the wake of National Farmers Union and

8

Iowa Mutual, which both concerned tort claims against

9

non­Indians.

that Congress was implementing that, and it provided

11

funding for tribal courts.

Another point ­­

voted for that statute was aware of that, right?

21

stemmed from those cases because that's what the

22

committee report says.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

This ­­ this was a statute

24

against the backdrop of two decisions of this Court

25

saying that the rule of Oliphant does not apply to civil

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

jurisdiction over non­Indians in tort cases

2

specifically.

3

And importantly also, in Iowa Mutual the

4

argument was made about, specifically in connection with

5

the diversity point, which Mr. Katyal has responded to,

6

but the argument that the policies of the deferred city

7

statute, such as concerns about perhaps competence of

8

tribal courts or bias, that they should at least inform

9

the analysis.

And the Court said that would be

10

inconsistent ­­ and this is before the 1993 statute ­­

11

that would be inconsistent with Congress's judgment

12

about encouraging tribal courts as an important

13

expression of tribal sovereignty.

14

And then Congress comes along and provides

15

funding and training, statutes that ­­ that provide for

16

training of tribal judges, money to support the payment

17

of tribal judges and to support tribes in publication of

18

their tribal codes.

19

and then again in the year 2000 enacted a statute with a

20

similar finding.

Congress thoroughly examined this

particular.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it consistent

with your concept of due process, as a general matter,

15

to have a nonmember tried by a jury consisting solely of

16

tribal members?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

I ­­ I think there's a very

strong argument that it is because the ­­ the tribal

members are the citizens of the jurisdiction whose

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you.

I have three

17

points, and they all happen to relate to questions by

18

Justice Scalia.

19

The first deals with the question of whether

20

tribal tort law, the last point by my friend, is a form

21

of regulation.

22

the preemption context in which the Court has said

23

something like that.

24

that is about the substance of the tort law, not the

25

forum where it occurs.

And we have cases like Regal, we have

But the big difference is that

that the application of State tort law was a form of

5

on a Federal question, it would still be State

6

regulation.

7

But if that was heard in a Federal district

So my point here is:

The most that can

8

establish is that the substantive tort law's regulation,

9

not the forum.

We do not agree that that's so, but it

10

would be the only thing that they could get from that

11

argument.

adjudication from the substance of the tort law.

What would remain is the difference of

The second point, as Justice Scalia, I will

of the Constitution.

4

incident of sovereignty when the States were subject to

14

17

State courts.

And we know that from one other

your point that the Court has never held, despite

dictum, that a nonmember is subject to adjudication in a

21

tribal court.

22

it is, I think, respectfully implausible to believe that

23

Congress thought it was true in 1880, at a time when the

24

tribes had much less developed legal systems.

the rule is.

12

That is a bad system.

and again, that jurisdictional rules need to be known

14

ahead of time, and they need to be clear.

15

understand the answer to our point that it is

16

disrespectful of the sovereignty that is asserted here.

If the Tribal Supreme Court can constantly be overruled

by a circuit court in Mississippi, are we seriously
