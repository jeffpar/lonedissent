ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

To affirm the Ninth Circuit on the first two

12

questions presented, this Court must accept the

13

following two propositions:

14

First, a plaintiff can force a court to

15

adjudicate the merits of his claim simply by refusing

16

the defendant's offer of capitulation and complete

17

relief.

18

And, second, that a plaintiff has what

19

amounts to a substantive right to class litigation that

20

applies as soon as the complaint is filed and that

21

entitles the case to proceed even if his individual

22

claim drops out before ­­

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there any controversy

over whether the ­­ the ­­ the offer is complete relief?
MR. GARRE:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

The district court found that it was at page 40 of the

2

Petition Appendix.

3

based on that premise.

Petition Appendix.

The Ninth Circuit decided this case
That's at page 5a of the

5

So I think as the case comes ­­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Do we take it on that

assumption, too?

8

MR. GARRE:

9

Now ­­ now, they have argued below that the

10

only reason that it wasn't for complete relief was that

11

­­ because it didn't provide for attorneys' fees.

12

the TCPA, the underlying statute here, does not provide

13

for attorneys' fees.

14

I think you should, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

But that's a merits question

15

as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees.

16

the question is complete ­­ you know, "complete relief"

17

means what the plaintiff has asked for.

18

has asked for attorneys' fees here.

19

MR. GARRE:

If

The plaintiff

I don't think that's what

20

"complete relief" means, Your Honor.

21

that the plaintiff has received everything that he

22

could ­­ that he could if he received a judgment in this

23

­­ in his favor ­­

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think it means

Well, he would ­­ he

would receive a finding of liability, which you didn't

admit in your offer.

2

MR. GARRE:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He ­­ I ­­
He would ­­ he would be

4

entitled to an injunction against that activity, the

5

activity that caused this particular situation, and if

6

others were shown, to an injunction in other ways.

7

So I don't see how this could be ­­ putting

8

aside the class action, putting aside the attorneys'

9

fees, those appear to me to be fairly critical liability

10

determinations that were not made by the court below.

11

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

First, as the case comes

12

to the Court, I think it is accepted that the offer was

13

for complete relief.

14
15

Now let me try to answer the points that you
raise.

16

First, he's not entitled to a finding of

17

liability.

18

finding of liability, then essentially no case could

19

become moot.

entitled to the finding of liability.

If a litigant was always entitled to a

You have to start all over

A settlement offer and a settlement contract

8

and a settlement agreement are different from a

9

judgment, and you do not have a judgment.

10

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

11

the accepted principle is that a settlement moots the

12

case and requires the court to dispose of the case.

13

mean, I think that's the accepted principle.

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
that.

I

And ­­

But you didn't pursue

You didn't apply under the rules for a judgment.

MR. GARRE:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well ­­
And ­­ and ­­ and if you

18

want us to write an opinion and say, oh, well, a

19

settlement offer is the same as a judgment, that just

20

doesn't accord with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

21

or with our cases like the Kokkonen case.

22

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, I think ­­ I

23

think this case is consistent with the Kokkonen case.

24

What the Kokkonen case recognized is that, once a case

25

has come to an end, the Court has ancillary jurisdiction

enforcement of a consent decree.

10

It is deemed withdrawn, and it cannot be

So we have a Federal rule directly in point,

11

and that instructs litigants what an offer of judgment

12

means.

13

Why do we look any further than that?
MR. GARRE:

Well, first, Your Honor, this

14

case, there was not only the Rule 68 offer of judgment,

15

but a freestanding settlement offer.

16

the mechanics of Rule 68 don't apply here.

17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we think that
It's ­­

Well, isn't that rather

an end run around the offer of judgment?

19

MR. GARRE:

Well, I don't ­­ I don't think

20

so.

21

the controversy still exists given that the defendant

22

has offered the plaintiff everything that he ­­ he could

23

secure through a Federal judgment.

24
25

I mean, it still presents the question of whether

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Thomas' exact words, but it's a whole different kettle

12

MR. GARRE:

Well, I mean, here's how I think

it's different, Your Honor.

14

You're right.

It is different.

But it's

15

different in that this Court has repeatedly said that

16

the class has no independent legal status until it's

17

certified.

18

Healthcare, you had a statutory right to a collective

19

action, but the Court said that that didn't trump

20

Article III.

And it's different in that, in Genesis

21

And here you just ­­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

it's an invitation to people to join you.

24

all that ­­ it's a permissive joinder.

25

MR. GARRE:

All it ­­ all it is ­­
That's all ­­

Well, it was still pretty

Alderson Reporting Company

9
1

important to the plaintiff in that case, and it was a

2

statutory right.

3

And here the question is:

When the

4

individual claim drops out, is there any basis for the

5

action to proceed simply so that, on the ­­ on the

6

potential that a class could be certified?

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One ­­ one is ­­ is that

potential.

9

The other is, it's not that I would be

10

entitled to attorneys' fees from the loser, but if

11

there's a class, then there are a lot of other people

12

who will share in the attorneys' fees and I'll have to

13

pay less.

14
15

MR. GARRE:

cost­sharing argument that was made in Roper.

16
17
18

And that ­­ that's the

And if I could say a couple things about
that.
First, the plaintiff in this case, unlike

19

the plaintiff in Roper, never made that argument below.

20

He never argued in favor of cost sharing.

21

complaint, if you look on page 21 of the Joint Appendix,

22

touts that he has all the financial resources necessary

23

to bring this action.

24
25

In fact, the

Second of all, in Roper the Court relied on
that interest solely for the purpose of allowing the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

appeal from the denial of certification when the mooting

2

event occurred after the denial of certification.

3

So there you had a real relation back issue.

4

If the Court had been wrong in denying certification,

5

then the case never would have become moot in the first

6

place.

7
8

Here, the mooting event takes place before
certification.

9

There's nothing to relate back to.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I could go back a

10

little bit, Mr. Garre.

11

question that Justice Scalia started with.

22

dispute about whether he's entitled to these things.

23

Now, you might be completely right as to

But that

You can't ­­ a court can't just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

say, oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his

2

view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's

3

what the litigation is all about.

4

MR. GARRE:

And a court can make that

5

determination, just like a court can determine whether

6

or not a defendant who says he's going to stop his

7

action has truly voluntarily ceased his action.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:
that determination.

A court can absolutely make

But the question is:

Does the

10

court make that determination in the guise of a mootness

11

motion?

12

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think it absolutely

13

does, just like it would in the voluntary cessation

14

context.

15
16

I ­­ I want to be clear because I think we
have a little bit of a ­­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why can't it ­­ why

18

can't it do that in the context of a summary judgment

19

motion?

20

Wouldn't the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment

21

motion in which you admit the facts that make you

22

liable, or you concede the facts that make you liable,

23

and then you fight about the legal questions?

24
25

I mean, why does it have to moot the case?

MR. GARRE:

The ­­ the reason is, when ­­

If you go on page 57a

of the Petition Appendix, there's the freestanding

2

settlement offer, which isn't a Rule 68 offer.

3

The other thing about Rule 68 is it's really

4

not designed for the situation of complete relief.

5

designed for the situation where the defendant and

6

plaintiff have to gamble, essentially, over whether or

7

not an offer for less than complete relief is a

8

sufficient ­­ they ­­ they want to settle on that basis.

9

It's

In this case you had a freestanding

settlement offer.

outcome of the case sufficient to keep this case alive.

14

It provided for complete relief, and

Justice Kennedy, to get back to your point

15

about settlement ­­ and I think what's important to

16

recognize here is ­­ here's our position:

17

offer of complete relief is made and when a court has

18

determined that it is, indeed, for complete relief, then

19

the case has to come to an end.

20

it's ­­ it's moot at that precise moment or whether you

21

say it starts the ball rolling down the hill towards a

22

dismissal or entry of judgment for the plaintiff based

23

on the terms of the offer, the point is ­­ is that when

don't see "relation back" or "inherently transitory" in

2

exception doesn't apply because this case doesn't

3

involve an appeal from the denial of class

4

certification, and it's clear that the second case

5

exception doesn't apply, "inherently transitory,"

6

because in Genesis, this Court made clear that the

7

concern of the so­called picking off wasn't a sufficient

8

basis to say that a claim was inherently transitory.

That exception doesn't deal with the defendant's

difficult questions about certification, as this Court

5

I can't find any situation in which a court accepted a

Have you found any case

in the common law that ­­ where there was an offer that

MR. GARRE:

Well, three responses to that.

15

First, in the San Pablo case, for example, the court's

16

decision specifically makes clear that the plaintiff

17

refused that offer.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you've had to ­­ you

the plaintiff.

22

the California Civil Code that said an obligation for

payment is extinguished, is extinguished by an offer of

24

payment, if the money is immediately deposited in a

25

reputable bank in the name of a creditor.

And San Pablo turned on a provision of

MR. GARRE:

That's ­­ that's, of course,

right, Your Honor.

the rule, then it's a little bit odd that the court

didn't mention the fact that he didn't accept it at all.

The other point I wanted to make in response

But, of course, if acceptance was

6

to Justice Sotomayor's question is:

7

footnote in our opening brief that has many cases

8

recognizing this principle, and in our reply brief, we

cite the holding case out of the English courts.

It's

10

an 1840 case, and that case is exactly on point.

It

involved a situation where a claim was brought for a

debt, the defendant came in and said, here's your money,

1890s, which were really about liabilities had ­­ that

23

had already been satisfied, and the court said, it's

24

25

But there's really no history at all ­­ and tender

You have these three cases in the '90s,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

offers have existed for a long, long time.

2

There's no history at all of ­­ of saying

3

that a tender offer moots a case, as opposed to the

4

classic understanding, the common law understanding, of

5

tender offers was that it created an incentive for

6

parties, and that that was their purpose and that was

7

their effect, was to incentivize parties to do

8

something, but not to ­­ for ­­ not to provide a

9

mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a

10

party decided that, for whatever reason, he thought that

11

the tender offer was not good enough.

12

MR. GARRE:

So I think first ­­ just a

13

quibble ­­ I do think there's a longstanding practice of

14

recognizing that when the defendant has been offered

15

everything he could secure, the case goes away.

16

Second of all, and I think, you know, maybe

17

more important:

18

in Genesis Healthcare itself ­­ itself recognizes that

19

acceptance can't be the rule in all cases.

20

recognize in the situation where the plaintiff doesn't

21

accept for obstinacy or madness, but once you're there,

22

you recognize that acceptance can't be the rule.

23

that's got to be right, because in the voluntary

24

cessation context, we don't require the plaintiff to

25

accept that.

I mean, I would say that your dissent

mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case.

The appropriate remedy in a case where it's

4

absolutely clear that ­­ that the ­­ that the defendant

5

has given ­­ has offered the plaintiff everything the

6

plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case,

7

but where it's absolutely clear, where the defendant has

8

offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked

9

for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent

10

wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for

11

mootness, but to grant judgment in favor of the

12

plaintiff.

MR. GARRE:

But, again, that's only one

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

16

And they

SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to take the opportunity to clarify

17

the Article III question by addressing the elements of

18

an Article III case or controversy, an established

19

Federal practice that I believe shows that an offer ­­

20

an unaccepted offer, in particular, cannot moot a case.

21

And if there's time, I'd like to address the derivative

22

sovereign immunity argument.

23

First, there is a distinction that this

24

Court has established between prospective relief and

25

retrospective relief.

When you seek prospective relief,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

you need to show an ongoing or imminent injury.

2

In that context, a defendant can actually

3

halt the injury that's necessary by stopping, so long as

4

you meet the voluntary cessation doctrine or ­­ so long

5

as you show that it's not capable of repetition you're

6

going to be in review.

7

prospective relief, that is, the injury that's occurring

8

now or in the future, can end.

9

So the injury with respect to

When we're talking about retrospective

10

relief, damages, the injury is in the past.

11

injury, but the injury continues to exist.

It's not

16

that ­­ caused by the defendant.

17

judicial relief would likely redress the injury.

the requested relief, even when there's been an offer,

is:
