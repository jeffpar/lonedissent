ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. CARVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Every year, Petitioners are required to

12

provide significant support to a group that advocates an

13

ideological viewpoint which they oppose and do not wish

14

to subsidize.

15

Amendment violation should be overturned, both to end

16

this ongoing deprivation of basic speech and association

17

rights, and to restore consistency and predictability to

18

the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Carvin, is it

20

permissible, in your view, to allow the union to be the

21

exclusive representative so that nobody else is at the

22

bargaining table?

23

MR. CARVIN:

Yes, that's fine with us.

Our

24

objection, of course, is being forced to subsidize that

25

exclusive representative.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

The fact that they are exclusive

2

representative impinges on my clients because it

3

disables them from individually negotiating with the

4

school board, but that is justified by the need for an

5

exclusive representative.

6

And that is why, indeed, requiring agency

7

fees in the collective bargaining context is less

8

justified than, for example, requiring agency fees to

9

support union lobby.

10

In the ­­ in collective bargaining context,

11

we are required to free ride on the union because they

are the exclusive representative and we don't have our

MR. CARVIN:

to subsidize it.

you can have agency shops but the agency fees can only

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, one of the points of

2

your public employee cases generally, Mr. Carvin, is

3

essentially to ensure that when the government acts as

an employer, that the government be put in the same

5

position as a private employer; in other words, that the

6

various constraints that would constrain the government

7

when it's acting as sovereign fall away and a different

8

and lesser set of constraints apply that are meant

9

essentially to ensure that the government doesn't use

10

its position as leverage over things it oughtn't to be

11

able to control, but that the government can do the same

12

things that a private employer can.

And so why doesn't this fall within that

category of things?

In other words, you've just said

So too with the government

For two reasons, Justice Kagan.

19

First, I must respectfully disagree with the premise.

20

None of the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence quite

21

says public employers have the same rights as private

22

employers.

23

Private employers under the Constitution can

24

discriminate on the basis of political affiliation.

25

They can even discriminate on the basis of sexual

Alderson Reporting Company

orientation.

2

can do that.

3

But nobody thinks that public employers

private employers.

But the ­­ the government, when it's acting

as an employer with respect to its employee workforce,

16

really ought to be able to do the same things that a

17

private employer can.

18

MR. CARVIN:

The Court's

19

government­as­employer speech and First Amendment draw a

20

clear distinction between restricting employee speech,

21

like under the Pickering line of cases where there is

22

deferential review, and circumstances such as this where

23

they do leverage the employment relationship to coerce

24

the employee to subsidize or associate with an outside

25

group.

That's obviously ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. CARVIN:

How is that different ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. CARVIN:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that sounds ­­

Similarly ­­
­­ like you're drawing a

10

distinction between restricting speech and subsidizing

11

12

sides of the same coin, that compelled speech is ­­ is

no less and no greater an offense than compelled

of ­­ of speech scrutiny given to the compulsion speech.

19

For example, the ­­ you can stop unions from

But Your Honor, the scrutiny given

20

making political contributions under the case law, but

21

that hardly suggests you can compel a nonmember to

22

subsidize the union's contributions.

23

You can stop public employees under the

24

Hatch Act from engaging in basic political

25

participation, but that hardly suggests that you could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

require a nonmember to subsidize political activity.

2

So there's always been a clear distinction

3

in the case law between those two things precisely

4

because subsidization is an entirely different

5

infringement than restricting employee speech.

6

Restricting employee speech is an inherent

7

part of the employment relationship.

to be able to restrict the employees' speech, as this

Court has frequently noted, or you couldn't have a

Neither of those concerns is present when

16

you have a categorical rule that requires one set of

you're not involving the Federal judiciary in personnel

22

leveraging the employment relationship to require

23

something that the State couldn't require directly.

And it's certainly not an inherent part of

It is, to use your phrase,

Well, why are we

treating the government differently than a private

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12

employer?

2

You just earlier said, and I think our ­­

3

our cases are replete with the point that as employer,

4

the government can already restrict speech which is, I

5

think, a higher problem than subsidization.

6

We've already permitted subsidization of bar

7

associations, of government programs.

8

assessments on a lot of different levels, so why can't

9

the government, as employer, create a State entity?

We've permitted

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Hold on, Mr. Carvin.

No.
Oh ­­

I'm sorry.

I'll get you the section.

17

MR. CARVIN:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.
It says, "When

19

recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative, a

20

union assumes an official position in the operational

21

structure of a school."

22

So it seems to me that ­­ and California

23

tells the union what topics it can negotiate on, it

requires them to do training, and in the end it accepts

their recommendations with respect to ­­ to the issues

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Carvin ­­

Do you ­­
­­ remember, one, you're

5

assuming that these provisions are completely severable,

6

which I imagine depends on the contract.

7

But number two, even suppose that they are

severable, these provisions are bargained for benefits.

9

The contracts would read differently.

The unions would

10

have gotten different things if that provision had not

11

been there.

12

So you're essentially saying that the exact

13

same contract should go forward, notwithstanding that

14

the union has given up things, or has not gotten things,

15

because the agency fee provision is in the contract.

MR. CARVIN:

No.

disagree with the factual matter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DUMONT

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

MR. DUMONT:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

California understands the First Amendment
interests that are involved in this case.

9

But the State also has critical interests in

10

being free to manage the public workplace, much like a

11

private employer, unless we are improperly leveraging

12

the employment role to coerce or suppress citizens'

13

speech.

14

So let me try to briefly address why I

15

think, if we are going to have collective bargaining in

16

the public sector, mandatory agency fees can serve

17

important State interests without unduly burdening

citizens' speech.

7

Precisely because of the company union concern, what's

8

delicate about this, from the State's point of view, is

9

that we want ­­ if we're going to have collective

10

bargaining, we need to have a system where there's one

11

representative that we can deal with, and that

representative has to be both a good partner for us,

MR. DUMONT:

important that we not fund it directly, and that we

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

It's ­­ it's hard to

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

41
1

visualize this in a pure employer­employee relationship,

2

when the collective bargaining agreement, itself, has to

3

be submitted for public review and public comment.

4

That ­­ that suggests that you're doing more than simply

5

regulating the employment relationship.

6

MR. DUMONT:

Well, the public employment

context is certainly different from the private context,

and that's one of the important ways.

that.

10

We don't contest

But I think the question is, before you get

to the final legislative approval or ­­ or board

legitimately, that will be a workable system, both for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it's ­­ it's almost

concern.

When you are dealing with a governmental

And is it not true that many teachers are ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43

strongly, strongly disagree with the union position on

2

teacher tenure, on merit pay, on merit promotion, on

3

classroom size?

4

And you ­­ the term is free rider.

The

5

union basically is making these teachers compelled

6

riders for issues on which they strongly disagree.

7

Many teachers think that they are devoted to

8

the future of America, to the future of our young

9

people, and that the union is equally devoted to that

10

but that the union is absolutely wrong in some of its

11

positions.

12

it ­­ correct me if I'm wrong ­­ agency fees require

13

that employees and teachers who disagree with those

14

positions must nevertheless subsidize the union on those

15

very points.

16

And agency fees require, as I understand

MR. DUMONT:

And let me ­­ what I'd like to

do is to separate out the important public policy

issues, which we do not deny cross­cut between the

public's fear and the ­­ the realm of citizens' speech

20

and the ­­ the isolated collective bargaining realm.

21

They ­­ they do cross­cut, but that ­­ that does not

22

mean that the two spheres are the same.

23

So in the collective bargaining context,

24

what the employer needs is to get one agreement with one

25

group of employees, which we do by having one union.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

almost ­­ it's almost guaranteed that not everyone will

agree with all the positions that are taken by the union

5

that represents the majority of employees.

6

The employees get to pick

And because it's a democratic process,

From the employer's point of view, we need

to get a contract, is to have one representative that

8

can speak with one voice for all those disparate people.

9

Now, I understand that you'll be speaking

10

on ­­ on delicate issues.

11

is that outside the context of getting a contract, we do

12

not try to suppress at all the wide or enriched variety

that include a wide range of services that are

16

negotiated between the union and the government.

17

some of these are monetary.

18

hot­button issues, to be sure, Justice Kennedy, but many

19

of them are also mundane issues about health and welfare

20

benefits, what times teachers need to show up, how long

21

their lunch break can be without having to perform a

22

duty, what the policies are for transferring teachers

23

between and among school districts, and these are all

24

basic services that require research, legal

25

representation, conferring and consulting, communicating

They are very long, detailed agreements

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose, if that's

5

so convincing, the union can convince teachers to join

6

the union.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Well ­­ and, in fact, in

8

California, the overwhelming majority of the teachers

9

are in the union, and it's only a small percentage that

10

have opted not to.

11

But I would go further, Justice Kennedy, in

12

saying that what we are talking about here are a range

13

of services that they're providing.

14

a service fee for the State law that provides for the

15

exclusive representative to be the union when that is

16

voted for by a majority of the workers.

17

We're talking about

And here, this Court's cases have

18

distinguished between citizens' speech, where the very

19

teacher who might disagree with the union's position is

20

free to go and speak publicly about that position, and

21

employment speech, where this Court's cases have been

22

extraordinarily deferential to the government in

23

upholding restrictions on what speech employees may

24

make.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But ­­ but ­­ but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

56
1

philosophically, if you use Pickering in this case,

2

you're committing error of composition.

3

comparing a whole group of persons who have their views

4

coerced or compelled against one person that ­­ that ­­

5

Pickering is just inapplicable on that ­­ on that

6

ground.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

You're

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

8

think that it is fair to suppose that the government, in

9

deciding whether it's going to establish a relationship

10

with its workers and were to get input, is necessarily

11

going to be dealt with a cacophony of views unless it

12

comes up with a reasonable system of management to get

13

those views collected and have them represented by an

14

exclusive representative.

15

trade­off that Abood recognized.

16

And that is the basic

And I would note that because different

17

States have chosen, based on their history, their

18

culture, their experiences with the labor management

19

system in the private sector, to come up with different

20

results.

21

And here, I would say that Wisconsin and

22

Michigan, which recently adopted alterations to their

23

public management sector, established this point.

24

Because on the one hand, the legislature in Wisconsin

25

decided we're going to do away with public sector agency

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

57
1

fees for school teachers and for government workers, but

2

we're going to keep it for public safety officers,

3

police officers, firefighters, because we determined

4

there is a legislative interest in having agency fees.

5

Why?

The firefighters brief in this case

6

explains that many States don't have safety regulations

7

for firefighters.

8

up coming through the collective bargaining process,

9

where firefighters work out negotiated rules to

11

And so a lot of these regulations end

establish what is a safe way to fight a fire.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And all of that

12

would still survive if the Petitioners prevail, unless

13

your basic argument that if you do away with agency's ­­

14

agency fees, the unions are going to collapse and not be

15

in a position to negotiate those safety requirements.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Chief Justice, the necessity

17

standard has never been the standard when the government

18

is operating as employer or proprietor.

19

been a case that you would judge the agency ­­ the

20

government's decision on the basis of what is

21

appropriate or reasonable.

22

It has always

And if you look at it from that standard,

23

what the firefighters are saying here is that it's

24

actually essential to have agency fees, because they are

25

using those fees to benefit all of the workers in the ­­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's something other

13

than that.

14

question which raised an issue, and we heard it before.

15

Your ­­ your ­­ your last colleague mentioned this.

16

California needs this rule that it has,

That would be the same as Justice Scalia's

17

because it wants, on the other side of the bargaining

18

table, a coherent group of people to negotiate for the

19

workers on wages, hours, working conditions, et cetera.

20

Now, the Chief Justice said, I can

21

understand that argument if the alternative is the union

22

is destroyed, because then there's nobody.

23

that that argument's a good argument because they're

24

going to buy fire trucks and some other things.

25

And you say

Is there anything else that backs up that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

59
1

argument?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

I'd like you to explain it.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Sure.
I think it's important, and

Yes.

The flip side is that

6

the State briefs and the City briefs that have been

7

submitted in this Court note what happened when the

8

agency fee process didn't occur.

9

In New York City, for example, there were

10

strikes that were occurring all of the time until an

11

agency fee ­­ fee system was put into place, and that

12

enabled the City to better deliver transit services,

13

school services, and the like.

14

So you have both the positive story by ­­

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I ­­ I don't understand

16

that.

17

why would agency fees enable the city to do things that

18

it couldn't do before?

19

I just absolutely don't understand it.

MR. FREDERICK:

Why ­­

Because it enables all of

20

the workers to know they are making a shared sacrifice

21

for the purpose of working together to establish a

22

coherent position with their employer.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's ­­

You say that, but I ­­ it

doesn't mean anything to me.
MR. FREDERICK:

I understand ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You have a union

bargaining, and the city says no.

3

that if there are enforced fees to the union, the city

4

will say yes?

report on in the absence of a factual record ­­ because

this was basically brought as a facial challenge ­­ is

It sounds to me like

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

61

your argument cuts exactly the opposite way.

The ­­ the problem that's before us is

3

whether or not individuals can be compelled to support

political views that they disagree with.

6

if they do, then those political views are going to

prevail.

That's why they don't want to join the ­­ that's why

pushing that.

11

then the union will prevail, contrary to the objecting

12

employee's views.

13

But you say you should force them because

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

What I'm saying, Mr.

14

Chief Justice, is the States can make rational and

15

reasonable judgments that for their workability of a

16

system, they can have an agency­fee process.

17

Abood recognized the very Federalism

18

interests that are at stake here, where different States

19

have different experiences, and this is an opportunity

20

for the States to draw upon those distinctive

21

experiences in coming up with a system that's fair for

everyone.

that opportunity to develop a record, what would you

have put in it?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

If you had had

Well, the first thing I

5

would have put in, it would have been a response to

6

Justice Kennedy's question, which is that Ms. Friedrichs

7

has said publicly she's happy with the positions the

union is taking on pay.

9

suppose that we're going to decide a case of this kind

10

of constitutional import with a lead plaintiff who has

11

said publicly she agrees with the union's positions on

12

pay.

13

It would be anomalous to

Can you ­­ can

you ­­ do you think you can find one employee who

doesn't?

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

You don't think.

I think that there are

hundred­page collective bargaining agreement in which

22

reasonable people can say, we don't like where the

bargain got struck.

But the point here is government workability
and assessing the reasonableness of the government's

position.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you think you can ­­ I

that you're right on this ­­ the Thaler law was a mess.

5

It was strike after strike.

show is that that approach, compared to the assessment

the union's position, and therefore there will be of

arguing, and I would guess that people would have

written articles about that now, and ­­ and ­­ if that's

14

so.

this constitutional significance on the basis of a

hypothesis based on ­­

you was, do you want to put information in the record on

nothing in the agency fee process that suppresses the

ability of teachers to speak out publicly, and even

On the second question

10

presented, we think that the decision ought to be

affirmed because Abood correctly recognized that here,

where there was basically no burden on the person who

wanted to opt out, that that was in itself a core

14

question.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what you're

16

saying, it's easy for the person to check a box saying I

17

opt out.

18

It's also easy to check a box saying opt in.
MR. FREDERICK:

It's administratively ­­

19

actually, in a system where the overwhelming majority ­­

20

and we're talking about more than 90 percent of the

21

people are paying the fees, even those that are

nonchargeable fees under the Lehnert line to support

23

political activities, it's administratively much easier

24

to count a smaller number.

25

And the question is whether the suppression

level of compulsion.

Well, let me just say that

the perpetual opt out is not an issue in this case.

21

acceptable way to do, to say I want to opt out until

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

11

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

13
14
15
16
17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Let me begin by summarizing the three
fundamental reasons why Abood should be reaffirmed.
First, in the four decades that Abood has

18

been the law, this Court's jurisprudence in the area

19

of ­­ of employment relations, First Amendment

20

jurisprudence in the area of employment relations has

21

converged with Abood in a way that fortifies its

22

foundations and does not erode them, because what those

23

cases have recognized is when the government is acting

24

as employer managing the workforce, it should receive

25

reasonableness review in order to give it the latitude

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

70
1

comparable to that of a private employer to manage its

2

workforce, and not exacting scrutiny that applies when

3

government is a sovereign regulating the citizens.

4

Second, in those four decades, more than 20

5

States have enacted and enforced laws that allow the

6

public employers in those States to have the same

7

latitude that Congress gave private employers to decide,

8

based on workplace needs and local conditions, whether

9

agency fee requirements will help them achieve the

10

purposes for which they ­­ for which they adopt

11

collective bargaining.

12

And the reliance goes far deeper than those

13

20 State laws and the thousands of contracts affecting

14

millions of people that are based on those laws.

15

those States, the agency fee requirement has worked its

16

way, woven its way into the fabric of the relation

17

between workers and management and the public's fear.

18

In those States, the unions have taken on

In

19

such obligations as training and the like, funded by

20

agency fees that make the workplace more effective for

21

management, as well as more effective for employees.

22

And if you were to take those away, you're

23

going to disrupt those long­term relationships that have

24

developed over time, and the expectations that have

25

developed over time, and you're going to replace them

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

71
1

with a different kind of a situation in which the union

2

is going to have a different set of incentives, trying

3

to ­­ trying to ensure that the maximum number of people

4

are willing to pay union fees.

5

And the way that the unions are likely to

6

try to do that is through trying to convince employees

7

that you ­­ that they need the union because otherwise

8

management is going to do them harm.

9

that that's a significant problem here for public

And I do think

10

employer perspective now, in a time of budgetary

11

constraints, when difficult decisions have to be made

12

and cuts have to be made.

13

It's of great benefit to the employer, to

14

the government as employer, to have the union

15

participate in those judgments so that they are

16

perceived as fair as the ­­ by the workforce, and so

17

that the union then, in effect, vouches for management

18

with the workforce and prevents disruption.

19

think the reliance interests go very deep here.

20

So I do

And then the third point I would make is

21

that we're talking about overruling a precedent of 40

22

years' standing.

23

showing of changed circumstances, it seems to me.

24
25

There need to be ­­ needs to be a

Now, with respect to the question of ­­ of
the role that agency fee ­­ the role that agency fees

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

72
1

play in the process, I think it is quite important, and

2

this goes to a point you raised, Justice Scalia.

3

never said, and no case since Abood has ever said, that

4

agency fees are necessary to union survival.

5

couldn't have said that, because when Abood ruled as it

6

did, Taft­Hartley had been on the books for decades.

7

And so with respect to the private sector, what Congress

8

had said with respect to the private sector is that

9

employers get to choose.

Abood

Abood

Employees get to decide

10

whether the agency fee will help them achieve their

11

workplace goals.

12

that public employers ought to have the same kind of

13

choice to respond to workplace needs and local

14

conditions that prior employee ­­

15

And what the Court said in Abood was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The ­­ the fact that

16

Abood has been around for 40 years, does it affect your

17

point at all that the main justification for Abood

18

that's being advanced today is one that Abood did not

adopt?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

3

Abood, the parties on both sides were arguing Pickering.

I think Abood

And if one looks at the briefs in

But beyond that, I think ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In ­­ in ­­ in terms

6

of that, but in terms of the substantive analysis, it

7

can't really seriously be called a Pickering case.

8
9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

But I think it

shares ­­ what I said at the outset, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

is I think the key point:

11

Amendment law in the public employment context has, over

12

time, converged with Abood, in that the cases generally

13

have recognized that when government is acting as

14

employer, it has interests that, if government were

15

acting as sovereign regulating the citizenry, wouldn't

16

suffice to justify conditions on speech.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

That this Court's First

Well, Pickering is ­­

18

Pickering is the heart of your argument, so I ­­ I do

19

want to ask you a couple of questions about it.

20

Is it different from the situation here in

21

several respects?

22

the Pickering cases involve the termination or the

23

discipline of a public employee after ­­ a single

24

employee after the employee has made a statement that ­­

25

to which the employer objects.

One was brought out.

Pickering ­­

This is a prospective

Alderson Reporting Company

rule that applies to a huge category of employees.

2

The second is whether restrictions on what

3

employees can say are the same as compelling an employee

4

to make a statement or subsidizing a statement.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

Let me take ­­

So as to the ­­ as to the

latter ­­

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

­­ there are circumstances,

10

are there not, in which the Department of Justice could

11

terminate or take an adverse employment action against a

12

DOJ employee for something that that employee says as a

13

citizen on a question of public concern.

14

done, could it not?

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That could be

Yes.

Are there any circumstances

in which the Department of Justice could compel an

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I can't think of one, but

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that goes right to the difference, right to the

2

difference between government acting as employer,

3

managing the workplace, and government acting as

4

sovereign, regulating the citizenry.

5

In the latter situation, what this Court's

6

cases would say is that that is not government acting to

7

manage the workplace; that is government leveraging

8

its ­­ its control over the employee, acting as

9

sovereign, affecting that person in his role as citizen,

10

and that would get exacting scrutiny.

And that ­­ so that ­­ I think that's the

underlays Abood, and it underlays Garcetti, and frankly,

15

it underlays the political affiliation cases as well.

16

We're not arguing that Abood applies of its own
We're arguing that there's an insight that

Because if you look at those, what those

17

cases all say, contrary to what my friends say, is that

18

when government can show the political affiliation is a

reasonable requirement for the effective performance of

the job in question, that that affiliation requirement

21

can be upheld.

it's reasonableness.

about Pickering.

25

That, again, is not exacting scrutiny;
Every case lines up along that

And so ­­ and I ­­ I think that's the key point

And if I could, I just want to address a

couple other points.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I ­­ when ­­ when ­­

3

when a union is bargaining about a matter of ­­ of

4

public concern, you're saying that that's ­­ that is not

5

the same as commenting on a matter of public concern?

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

What I'm saying is

7

that it occurs in the context of the ­­ the collective

8

bargaining relationship, which is a ­­ which is ­­ it

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But I guess what I would

2

say about that, Justice Scalia, what I read this Court's

3

cases as saying in the employee speech context, in the

4

employee petitioning context, in the political

5

affiliation context, is that you ­­ yes, it's not wholly

6

free of First Amendment scrutiny.

7

government's interests as employer and prerogatives as

employer, you apply reasonableness review and not the

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess ­­ isn't it ­­ is

12

­­ you may know ­­ the case in which government as

13

employer is most likely to want to control what the

14

employee says and where he has the right to do that is

15

likely to be a case that involves the institution's job,

16

i.e., the public interest.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

That's why ­­ that's why I think there was

The distinction the Court has

3

And I respectfully submit that that ­­ that

4

that distinction applies with equal force here, and

5

especially given the stare decisis considerations

that ­­ that ought to govern this Court's decision in

7

this context that that is more than sufficient to

uphold, to reaffirm Abood.

stands.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What I would say about

that, Justice Sotomayor, is that in this context, the

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. CARVIN:

8

As to the absence of a factual record here,

Thank ­­ thank you.

9

it's important to point out that we gave them an amended

10

answer where they could make any allegation they wanted.

11

And at page 4 of their so­called opposition, it said, to

12

quote, "The unions do not oppose the entry of a judgment

13

on the pleadings."

14

Why is that?

Because they certainly ­­ it's

15

their burden to argue, for example, that agency fees

16

will lead to the demise of the union.

17

make any such allegation in their answer.

18

make any such allegation in response to

19

Justice Ginsburg's question, and they've got all the

20

facts and terms of the union's fiscal well­being.

21

That's because they can't make such an allegation in the

22

real world.

How do we know that?
