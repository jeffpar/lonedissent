CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

next in Case 15­446, Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee.
Mr. Beeney.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRARD R. BEENEY

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BEENEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

I'd like to begin this morning with why the

11

use of the broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient

12

in no way comports with the congressional purpose of

13

inter partes review, and then address why the Board's

14

ultra vires determination in instituting inter partes

15

review is subject to judicial review.

16

Consistent with history, Congress left to

17

the judiciary to determine construction standards, and

18

therefore, in the American Invents Act, there is no

19

explicit statutory language directing the Patent and

20

Trademark Office to use any particular standard of claim

21

construction.

22

But this Court should reverse, as a matter

23

of statutory construction, for four reasons.

24

summary, all agree that the

25

broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient demands a

Alderson Reporting Company

First, in

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

broad ability to amend claims, and that's so because the

2

broadest reasonable interpretation brings into play a

3

broader array of prior art that may be distinguishable

4

if the claims were given their actual interpretation.

5

In establishing inter partes review,

6

Congress sought to substitute and provide a district

7

court­like litigation for the determination of

8

patentability, and therefore, did not provide the wide

9

liberty to amend claims, as Justice ­­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I might be moved by your

11

argument if Congress had not given any right for the

12

Board to amend, because that would be consistent with

13

practices in the district court, where district court

14

can't amend under any circumstance.

15

Congress here said you can amend once.

16

that that supports your proposition.

17

MR. BEENEY:

But basically,
I'm not sure

I think ­­ Justice Sotomayor, I

18

think there is a distinction between allowing a party to

19

make a motion to amend and the absolute right to amend

20

even once.

21

amend in inter partes review.

22

extremely limited ability to seek to amend.

23

fact, in practice, that opportunity to seek to amend is

24

almost always denied.

25

congressional intent of establishing inter partes review

And Congress did not provide any right to
It provided only an
And, in

And it is denied consistent with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

to be court ­­ a court­like adjudication.

2

a matter of numbers, the Board has denied 95 percent of

3

the motions to amend.

4

review, the Board has allowed five motions to amend and

5

allowed four ­­ less than 30 claims to be amended, while

6

canceling 10,000 claims.

7
8
9

So simply as

In 42 months of inter partes

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What's the second of

your four?
MR. BEENEY:

The second reason why,

10

Your Honor, the ­­ the result below should be reversed

11

is because the ­­ Congress, in establishing inter partes

12

review, intended inter partes review to adjudicate

13

property rights.

14

attribute to those property rights a hypothetical

15

interpretation of their meets and bounds rather than

16

doing what district courts do, which is to give claims

17

their actual plain and ordinary meaning.

And in doing so, it makes no sense to

18

The third reason, Your Honors, why this

19

Court should reverse and ­­ and have the Patent and

20

Trademark Office use the ordinary claim construction

21

matter is because there are a number of anomalies that

22

injure the patent system and injure patentees that stem

23

directly from the use of inter partes review.

24

include a claim meaning different things in the courts

25

and before the Board.

Those

Those include different results

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

in the courts and the Board as to whether a patentee's

2

property rights are taken away.

3

claims meaning one thing for patentability in the Board

4

but a wholly different thing for infringement in the

5

district courts.

6

no reason to suspect that that was anywhere within

7

Congress's intent in enacting inter partes review.

8
9

And those include

That's simply untenable, and there's

Finally, this Court should reverse because
the government really has not in any way offered a

10

support of using the broadest reasonable interpretation

11

that is in any way tethered to inter partes review.

12

simply says historically, we've done this before, and so

13

we should be permitted to do it again.

14

It

Strikingly missing from the government's

15

position, however, is really any objection to taking the

16

district court's substitute that Congress enacted, and

17

using the claim construction that the district courts

18

do, the ordinary meaning of the claim terms.

19

There is nothing really in the government's

20

brief that suggests that it would be inappropriate to

21

use that claim construction, and that's the claim

22

construction that should be used.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is the standard ­­ is the

24

standard of proof for invalidity the same in an

25

infringement action in district court as it is in inter

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

partes review?

2

MR. BEENEY:

It is not, Justice Alito.

And

3

I think the reason ­­ there was a sensible reason behind

4

it in that Congress tweaked the court­like adjudicatory

5

system and recognized that it was establishing a board

6

of experts, and therefore, there was no reason to have

7

the presumption in favor of patentability that we find

8

in the district courts.

9

But that in no way suggests that the

10

Congress, in enacting inter partes review, was

11

suggesting that there be a different claim­construction

12

standard that are used in the district courts when inter

13

partes review was to be a substitute for district court

14

litigation.

15

If I may Your Honors, I'd like to delve into

16

the question that Justice Sotomayor asked about the

17

amendment process.

18

I think it's important to recognize, as the

19

Patent and Trademark Office repeatedly has before its

20

merits brief in this case, the profound distinction

21

between the ­­ permitting a party to make a motion to

22

amend in an adjudicatory context and the absolute right

23

to amend in the examinational contest ­­ context.

24

in fact, the PTO, as it participated in the Microsoft v.

25

Proxyconn case, submitted a letter to the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

And,

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

Circuit making exactly this point on April 27, 2015.

2

What the PTO said to the court was that, in fact, there

3

is this very profound distinction between the right to

4

make a motion to amend in an adjudicatory context and

5

the ability to amend patents in the examinational

6

context where there is an iterative, back­and­forth,

7

generally cooperative process between the examiner and

8

the patentee.

9

That is diametrically different to the

10

system that Congress established in inter partes review,

11

as the Patent and Trademark Office represented to the

12

district court.

13

And going back to the statistics that I was

14

citing in response to Justice Sotomayor's original

15

question, 95 percent of the motions to amend in inter

16

partes review are denied.

17

amended, while 10,000 have been canceled.

18

simply not the kind of ability that is necessary in

19

order to avoid the prejudice to the patentee of giving

20

her claims a construction broader than what they

21

actually are that's afforded in inter partes review.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Less than 30 claims have been

24

And ­­ and if

true, why does the patentholder need more than one

First, there is the institution

But for

10

of the ballgame is wholly inconsistent with its position

11

on the second question presented about appeal.

12

Obviously, the claim­construction interpretation is

13

subject to appeal, and so it can't be fixed in the

14

institution determination.

15

The final claim­construction standard that

16

the Board applies to make the ultimate decision as to

17

whether the patent is going to survive is in the final

18

decision that the Board renders.

19

it's too late for the patentee to make any kind of

20

determination as to whether it would like to amend and

21

cancel the claims that are under review.

At that point in time,

22

I also think it's important to distinguish

23

the examinational context, in which, historically, BRI

24

has been cabin to.

25

in the court­like litigation structure that Congress

MR. BEENEY:

What would happen, Your Honor,

10

be remanded to the Board to give Cuozzo's claims their

appropriate construction.

15

agreeing with us.

16

That's never happened in this

That would be the result of Your Honors

And we believe that once we go back to the

17

Board and the Board applies the appropriate construction

18

to our claims, our claims will survive review or ­­ or,

19

at ­­ at a minimum, we will be permitted to amend,

20

because the basis of the decision by the Board to deny

21

Cuozzo the opportunity to amend was that the claim

22

construction read out of the construction of the claims

23

an embodiment that's set forth in the specification.

24
25

Under the ordinary­meaning standard that the
Board should be applying in this adjudicatory context

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

that Congress set up to litigate over substantive

2

property rights, the Board would be applying the

3

ordinary­construction standard which we believe would

4

include the embodiment that's in this specification,

5

and, therefore, we would receive relief.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if ­­ if the ­­ if

7

the patent is invalid under its broadest, reasonable

8

interpretation, doesn't ­­ doesn't that mean the PTO

9

should never have issued the patent in the first place,

10

and doesn't that give very significant meaning and

11

structure to this process?

12

MR. BEENEY:

Not necessarily, Justice

13

Kennedy.

14

the broadest reasonable interpretation expedient, as the

15

government agrees it is, it is not a claim­construction

16

standard as the Federal circuit said in Skvorecz.

17

And ­­ and the reason is this:

The purpose of

What it does is try to test for ambiguity in

18

the claim language, not patentability.

19

the standard that Congress set in inter partes review.

20

But what the broadest reasonable interpretation does is

21

try to test for ambiguity in the patent language so it

22

can be amended.

23

or an application may not pass the broadest reasonable

24

expedient does not mean that the inventor has not

25

claimed a patentable invention.

Patentability is

So the fact that a patented invention

It simply means that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

the language is ambiguous, and the language needs to be

2

refined.

And that is a wholly different exercise.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

interpretation to make sure I'm right.

10

It looks at a claim.

If ­­ if I were the

me ­­ or am I wrong, that that's not what they do?

MR. BEENEY:

They do, but not to determine

12

whether the claims are patentable.

13

whether there's ambiguity in the language.

14

They do to determine

And, Your Honor, you can go back to a whole

15

line of district court cases from ­­ all the way from

16

Carr in, I think, 1924 in ­­ in the D.C. circuit to the

17

2016 decision in PCC Broadband, and all the cases in

other ones.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the question that

Justice Kennedy asked, and I think it's an important

5

one, to me, anyway, was, if you ­­ forget this

proceeding.

8

front of the Patent Office, and that's what they would

9

look at, and if it was too broad because that broad, you

If, in fact, in the broadest possible, or

10

know, it has flaws in it of whatever kind, the patent

11

doesn't issue.

Is that right or not right?

12

MR. BEENEY:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

It's either right or wrong.

You can tell me I'm right, or you can tell me I'm wrong.

15
16

It's not a question ­­

MR. BEENEY:

There isn't an iterative

process with the right to amend ­­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. BEENEY:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that.

So ­­
I know that.

I'm saying:

20

If at the end of the day, on the broadest reasonable

21

interpretation, it is not patentable, there is no patent

22

issued.

23

MR. BEENEY:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. BEENEY:

That's correct.
Okay.

Now ­­

That is correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

­­ if that's so, you could

2

look at this new law as ­­ as ­­ as you were looking at

it, as trying to build a little court proceeding.

thought it was just doing that, I would say you were

5

right.

6

If I

But there is another way to look at it.

And

7

the other way to look at it ­­ and that's what I would

8

like your comment about ­­ is that there are these

9

things, for better words, let's call them patent trolls,

10

and that the ­­ the Patent Office has been issuing

11

billions of patents that shouldn't have been issued ­­ I

12

overstate ­­ but only some.

13

person in business gets this piece of paper and ­­ and

14

looks at it and says, oh, my God, I can't go ahead with

15

my invention.

And what happens is some

16

And so what we're trying to do with this

17

process is to tell the office, you've been doing too

18

much too fast.

19

this come in and get rid of those patents that shouldn't

20

have been issued.

21

the same chance we gave you before, and that is you can

22

amend it once if you convince the judge you should have

23

done it before.

interpretation, you know, reasonable interpretation, it

And ­­

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15

and that is for the benefit of those people who were

2

suffering from too many patents that shouldn't have been

3

issued in the first place.

I don't know.

4

If it's that second purpose, then I would

5

think, well, maybe this is right, what they're doing.

6

And if it's ambiguous between those two purposes, I

7

would begin to think, well, maybe they should have the

8

power themselves under Chevron, Meade, or whatever, to

9

decide which to do.

10

Now, that's ­­ that's the argument, I think,

11

that's in my mind registering the other way.

12

you say?

13
14

MR. BEENEY:

So what do

Justice Breyer, if I agreed ­­

and respectfully, I'd like to explain why I disagree.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. BEENEY:

Uh­huh.

But ­­ but even if I did agree,

17

I ­­ I would say that Congress, in fact, established

18

exactly what Your Honor described.

19

system in which we are adjudicating property rights.

20

And it makes no more sense to adjudicate those property

21

rights in a court­like setting by pretending that those

22

rights are not what, in fact, was granted, what the

23

patentee claims, or what the patentee could assert in

24

district court infringement litigation than it does

25

to ­­ when you're in ­­ trying to determine whether

Alderson Reporting Company

But it established a

2

I would submit is really an apt analogy for the

obviousness­anticipation tests.

4

boundaries ­­ the metes and bounds of that property

5

actually is.

6

We look at what the

So Congress, assuming that it did what Your

7

Honor suggested, established a system to do that, but it

8

established a system to adjudicate in a court­like

9

setting the actual patent rights that a patentee

10

obtains, not ones that someone suggests might be

11

broader.

12

language, not to adjudicate rights.

13
14

That is to determine ambiguity in claim

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

If language

is ambiguous, it can't have that plain meaning, can it?

15

MR. BEENEY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry?
How would you have a

17

plain meaning that a district court would apply if

18

language is ambiguous?

19

valid property right in something that's ambiguous?

20

MR. BEENEY:

How could it say that you have a

The test of the ordinary

21

meaning, as enunciated by Philips and its progeny, will

22

first look at the claim language.

23

in the claim language, then what is the meaning of that

24

patent will be determined in light of the specification,

25

the prosecution history, and other intrinsic evidence.

Alderson Reporting Company

If there's ambiguity

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17
1

In the rare case where there still may be

2

ambiguity, then the Court may consider extrinsic

3

evidence, dictionaries, other writings by the patentee,

4

what somebody of ordinary skill in the art might

5

determine a particular claim limitation to mean.

6

So there are a number of tools in the

7

ordinary­meaning­construction standard that should be

8

used here to ­­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Aren't those tools used

10

in determining the broadest ­­ the broadest reasonable

11

reading, meaning how can the PTO decide what a broad

12

reasonable reading is unless it looks at all of those

13

factors and decides that the specifications and all the

14

other things don't cure, continue to provide ambiguity

15

in the patent?

16

MR. BEENEY:

It ­­ it does not.

The

17

broadest reasonable interpretation is considerably

18

different than the ordinary meaning of construction

19

standard, and the fact that the Patent and Trademark

20

Office has admitted as much.

21

examination procedures, the Patent and Trademark Office

22

tells its patent examiners, we, quote, "do not interpret

23

claims in the same manners as the courts."

24
25

In the manual for patent

Just recently, a very important tool that
courts look at in the ordinary­meaning context, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

prosecution history, in the Federal Register the Patent

2

and Trademark Office said that the only time it looks at

3

prosecution history is when it is actually raised by the

4

parties, relied on by the parties, and explained by the

5

parties.

6

There are very different sub tools, if you

7

will, within broadest reasonable interpretation and

8

ordinary meaning, and that's because they intend to

9

accomplish different purposes.

One adjudicates

10

patentability, which is what Congress intended in IPR.

11

The other identifies ambiguity in claim language.

12

In fact ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. BEENEY:

Why ­­

­­ if one looks at ­­ if one

15

looks at the manual in Section 2111, the PTO tells its

16

examiners that one of the reasons we use the broadest

17

reasonable interpretation is because, unlike the courts,

18

we don't have before us a fully­developed prosecution

19

history.

20

do have a fully­developed prosecution history, and

21

that's what we should be looking at.

22

Well, when you're in inter partes review, you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does the

out in practice?

the same thing, or at least determining the scope of the

5

patent and whether or not it infringes?

6

MR. BEENEY:

What typically happens, Mr.

7

Chief Justice, is in those situations where a patent is

8

not subjected to inter partes review, and I file an

9

infringement case, is that the defendant may then seek

10

to file a petition before the Board ­­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. BEENEY:

13
14

Right.

­­ seeking review of the patent

and CICA stay in the district court.
And in fact, in this rather substantial

15

transfer of the adjudicatory function from the judiciary

16

to the administrative agency, we find that about 85

17

percent of patents that are being adjudicated by the

18

Board are subject to district court litigation.

19

those 85 percent of the time, district courts are

20

entering stays 70 percent of the time.

21

is happening is the judiciary is deferring to the Board

22

in making decisions about the patentability of the

23

claims that are at issue.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in fact, what

I would think that's

a little burdensome to the district court.

And in

They sort of

have to get deeply into the patent case and then take

2

whatever the Board says is the proper ­­ whether it's

3

valid or not.

4

MR. BEENEY:

Well, that, in fact, what

5

happens is that should a claim survive inter partes

6

review, then there are various estoppel provisions that

7

Congress enacted in the America Invents Act that prevent

8

the relitigation of the identical prior art that may

9

have been adjudicated by the Board in IPR.

10

So the district courts don't need to revisit

11

what happened in inter partes review, which is yet

12

another example of why Congress intended inter partes

13

review to be a substitute for district court litigation.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

doesn't happen in ­­ in inter partes review.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, I guess if I'm

20

trying to put myself in Congress's position, I'm ­­ I'm

21

looking at the PTO, and it does pretty much everything

22

by this broadest­construction standard.

23

the clear intent that you're suggesting, given the

24

backdrop of how the PTO generally operates, wouldn't I

25

say so?

Alderson Reporting Company

And if I had

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BEENEY:

I think not, Justice Kagan, for

2

the historical reason that Congress has never addressed

3

claim­construction issues.

4

left to the judiciary, number one.

It's always been a matter

5

And number two, the process that Congress

6

enacted in IPR is a brand new adjudicatory proceeding

7

unlike the PTO has ever confronted in the past.

8

arguing that one in inter partes review should use the

9

broadest reasonable interpretation is ­­ is really the

10

quintessential example of trying to pound a square peg

11

into a round hole simply because that peg used to fit a

12

very different hole.

13

I mean,

Congress established a very different

14

proceeding in inter partes review.

15

is done under very similar circumstances to the way a

16

case proceeds in a district court; it adjudicates actual

17

property rights and takes those property rights away.

18

And for all those reasons, if I may say, the statute

19

basically reeks that the ordinary­meaning­construction

20

standard used by the district courts should be used.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is court­like; it

and a little of the other, this inter partes review.

There are discovery differences; there are

4

So it's a ­­ it's a little of one

MR. BEENEY:

I think, Justice Ginsburg,

5

there are differences, but none of them go to the

6

fundamental fact of the claim­construction standard.

7

The system that Congress established is consistent only

8

with ordinary meaning.

9

And if you look again at this ability to

10

amend, in fact, in ­­ in examinational proceedings,

11

patent applications are almost always amended.

12

reexamination they're amended 66 percent of the time.

13

In inter partes review, they're amended less than one

14

half of one percent of the time, and that is why the

15

claim­construction standard should be the ordinary

16

meaning.

In

If I may, Your Honors, I'd like to just very

18

briefly turn to the issue of appellate review of the

19

Board's institution decision when the Board exceeds a

20

statutory authority.

21

Just a ­­ very briefly, our position is that

22

under the heavy presumption of judicial review of

23

administrative actions, there's nothing in the statutory

24

scheme that meets the heavy burden to overcome that

25

presumption.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

The statutory scheme here can be read,

2

either as the government would like to read it, to bar

3

review forever; but then that provision has to be

4

limited to its terms, that what is barred is the

5

director's decision to institute under that section, as

6

the statute says, not all the other criteria used in

7

determining whether to institute review.

8
9

But a better reading, as established by the
Federal circuit in Versata, and the government's

10

original position in Versata is that the statute only

11

prevents interim interlocutory review of the institution

permit review, and it should.

the broadest reasonable interpretation and in the

language of the claim in light of the specification as

it would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in

And so at the end of the analysis if a ­­ if

claim, a court has to adopt the saving construction that

8

ends the PT ­­ the one in ­­ in ­­ if the concern is one

9

about obviousness or anticipation in light of prior art,

10

that's probably going to be the narrower construction.

11

The Board ­­ the Board and the PTO, by

12

contrast, and before that, the Patent Office, have

13

recognized that if you have a claim that could

14

reasonably be read ­­ this isn't just a hypothetical

15

reading, but this is one, when you take all of this into

16

account, that could reasonably be read as reading on a

17

prior patent or as being obvious in light of a prior

18

patent, then that's a circumstance in which the Board is

19

going to say, you need to make this clear.

20

we're going to hold that it's not patentable.

21

Otherwise,

And that's exactly what's happening in the

motions to amend that are happening before the Board in

(Laughter.)

13

MR. GANNON:

I think

But what I mean by "narrower"

14

is that in ­­ in a district court proceeding, there are

15

other grounds that could be used to challenge the

16

patents and ­­ and it ­­ it could proceed along

17

different lines.

18

which the only grounds that can be considered are going

19

to be invalidity on the basis of 102 or 103.

20

true that you do not have to be somebody who would have

21

Article III standing in order to initiate an IPR.

22

That's another thing that we think shows that this

23

wasn't intended to be just a perfect substitute for

24

district court litigation.

25

This ­­ this is a narrower trap in

And it is

To be sure, most of these IPRs are going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

37
1

be instituted by parties who do have a competitive

2

interest, who were concerned about whether they're going

3

to be sued for infringement on the basis of this patent,

4

or ­­ or ­­ and, therefore, they want to make sure that

5

this patent that they think ought not to have been

6

issued is invalidated.

7

And this is ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's the evidence?

That

8

is to say, I picked that up from your brief, that this

9

statute is, in part ­­ call it a partial­Groundhog­Day

10

statute.

11

partly, it's designed here to go back to the ­­ I ­­ to

12

the Patent Office, probably because a large number of

13

businessmen told Congress that they were getting threats

14

of suits in respect to patents that obviously should

15

never have been issued.

16

You'll do it again until you get it right, and

Now, if that was the problem, then it

17

doesn't make ­­ it does make sense to say at least the

18

PTO has the authority under a partial­Groundhog­Day

19

statute to do that part of it over.

20

surprising; there are only six that actually got

21

amended, because they narrowed it before and because the

22

PTO held these are invalid, anyway.

23

isn't ­­ so that doesn't move me.

24
25

And that's not

Okay?

That

But look at the view I just expressed of the
statute.

There is another view that this is just a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

38
1

little district court proceeding designed to save people

2

that time and money that they'd have to spend on a big

3

district court proceeding.

4

All right?

Now, what's the evidence that the first view

5

that I had, which would not say this is just a little

6

district court proceeding, is correct?

7

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think we have two

8

different types of evidence.

9

history that we quote in our brief that said ­­ the

10

committee report said that a purpose of this was to

11

improve patent quality and ­­ and help justify the

12

presumption in favor of validity that a company's issued

13

patents in district courts.

We do have the legislative

14

But then in terms of the notion that it's

15

not just intended to be another little district court

16

proceeding that happens to be faster and cheaper is ­­

17

is all of the structural differences that Congress

18

imported here to ensure that it wasn't going to be

19

exactly the same.

20

to be limited to certain particular grounds of ­­ of

21

unpatentability under 102 and 103.

22

could be considered there is limited.

23

art that can be considered is prior art that comes in

24

patents and prior publications.

25

universe than could be used in a district court

And so, as I mentioned, it was going

The evidence that
The only prior

That's a narrower

proceeding.

2

going to be different.

And, of course, the burden of proof is

3

And so we think that in ­­ in speaking to

4

all of those things expressly and ­­ and then also in

5

ensuring that there still would be an opportunity to

6

amend claims, that, ultimately, is the reason why this

7

is not sufficiently like district court litigation for

8

the PTO to part ­­ to depart from its longstanding

9

practice of using the BRI approach in every type of

10

proceeding, including post­grant proceedings.

11

isn't the first Groundhog Day­type statute that ­­ that

12

the PTO has had.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This

Is there ­­ what ­­

14

is the district court free to disagree with the PTO

15

reading of the patent?

16

pertinent fact, a mixed question of law, in fact, in

17

litigation pending before me.

18

that you think this agency thinks this, but my

19

responsibility is to decide this case according to the

20

facts and law, and I disagree with the PTO's reading.

21

MR. GANNON:

Could it say, fine, this is a

Yes.

And I appreciate the fact

As long as the patent

still exists.

cancelation of the relevant claim, then there isn't

24

going to be something to be litigated about in district

If the end of the IPR proceeding is the

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

MR. GANNON:

Well ­­

But otherwise, the claim

3

construction that is adopted in ­­ in ­­ along the way

4

in getting to upholding the patent claim isn't going to

5

bind the district court any more than the district court

6

claim construction would bind a different district court

7

or the PTO.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, can it say

that I understand what PTO thinks the scope of the

10

patent is, but my responsibility is to interpret it

11

pursuant to a different standard, and under my different

12

standard I have a different result?

13

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

That ­­ that could be the

14

difference, and that is exactly what the courts have

15

repeatedly recognized, going back, as my friend noted,

16

to the 1924 decision from the D.C. circuit in the Carr

17

case, which recognized that the PTO and the courts are

18

using different standards precisely because you can

19

still clarify the scope of the claim when you're before

20

the PTO.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the district

22

court interprets the patent, is ­­ is that binding on

23

the PTO?

24

MR. GANNON:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

Alderson Reporting Company

And if the PTO

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

41
1

interprets the patent, that's not binding on the

2

district court.

3
4

MR. GANNON:

That's right.

And the same

thing is ­­ it's ­­

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. GANNON:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well ­­

The same thing ­­
I'm sorry.

8

seems to me that that's a bizarre way to conduct

legal ­­ decide a legal question.

10

does it work?

11

It just

I mean, who ­­ how

Whoever gets to the judgment first, or ­­

MR. GANNON:

Well, with respect to the

12

question of whether the patent still exists, if the PTO

13

cancels the claims at the end of the proceeding, then

14

there won't be something to be litigating about in

15

district court.

16

If the PTO holds that the burden of proving

17

that this claim is unpatentable has not been satisfied,

18

then somebody else can take another shot at that before

19

the district court.

20
21

This particular party who proceeded before

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that how estoppel

normally works?

7

MR. GANNON:

Here, Congress has expressly

8

prescribed that you cannot use, in the district

9

proceeding, an argument that you could have advanced ­­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the answer to my

11

question is, no, that's not the way estoppel normally

12

works.

13

MR. GANNON:

That's right.

But I would also

14

say that in this context, the Court has recognized in

15

Blonder Tongue that estoppel ­­ that ­­ that people can

16

repeatedly relitigate the question of patent validity in

17

district courts around the country.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there another

19

example where you have a complaint filed that puts an

20

issue before the district court during which the ­­ the

21

parties can take that issue away from the district court

22

and come up with an answer that then binds ­­ well, I

23

guess you're saying it doesn't bind the district court.

24
25

MR. GANNON:

I ­­ I'm saying that if the PTO

has the ability in the meantime to cancel the claim, to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

find that, yes, it is correct, this is one of those

2

patents we never ought to have issued in the first

3

instance, and that's true because when we've applied our

4

broadest­reasonable­construction approach ­­

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. GANNON:

Right.

­­ and the patent owner has ­­

7

has proffered amendments, they can't come up with

8

something that is actually patentable ­­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And that's

10

because of their ­­ their view, and then it goes back to

11

the district court, and the district court said, well,

12

thank you very much for your opinion, but my job is to

13

give a different analysis.

I'm not bound by this

14

broadest­possible reading.

And when I read the patent,

15

I think it comes out the other way, and that's how I'm

16

going to decide this case.

17

MR. GANNON:

It is true that a district

18

court, as long as the patent still exists and the

19

district court has jurisdiction over the parties and the

20

parties aren't precluded from ­­ from raising those

21

claims, it could end up at a different result at the end

22

of the day, precisely because of a higher burden of

23

proof and the fact that it ­­ it has to adopt the saving

construction ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

statute designed to make the patent system more

to the appealability issue.

Assuming I start from

the EEOC, the Mach Mining ­­ Mach Mining v. EOC, which

19

we don't easily think that Congress is intending to

20

prevent courts from enforcing its directives to Federal

21

agencies, okay?

22

Number two, this is a very specific statute

23

with steps about what ­­ when and when not the PTO can

24

institute one of these reviews.

25

provisions that say you can only do it under these

There's all sorts of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50

circumstances and only after making these findings.

2

Your position now is that that decision is never

3

reviewable.

4

Justice Ginsburg asked a very intelligent

5

question, which is, if we ­­ what's the purpose of it

6

outside the APA?

7

there's two purposes:

8

precludes reviews of the denial to grant such a hearing.

9

And your opposing colleague says
It precludes mandamus, and it

Why isn't that ­­ all of that enough to say

10

there should be some review?

11

the PTO don't do it except in these limited

12

circumstances, but nobody's going to ever watch you to

13

make sure that's what you're doing?

14

MR. GANNON:

Why would Congress tell

Well, I ­­ I'd say a couple

15

things.

16

would be a particularly odd way of saying that the only

17

way to get review of this in the Federal circuit is

18

through an appeal rather than mandamus.

First of all, calling something nonappealable

19

And secondly, with respect to the question

20

of whether this is just barring review of the decision

21

not to institute a proceeding, we think that the

22

contrast with the statute that applies to ex parte

23

reexams is ­­ is very telling here.

24

in several provisions of the Patent Act, Congress has

25

used the same phrase.

And this is because

They have called certain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

51
1

decisions by the PTO "final and nonappealable."

2

what they did here, but they ­­ they made that

3

applicable to a much broader category of decisions than

4

it had previously done.

5

That's

But in the context of ex parte reexams, in

6

Section 303(c), which is reprinted on Page 1a of the

7

government's brief, they've made final and nonappealable

8

only the following:

9

that no substantial new question of patentability has

10

The determination by the director

been raised.

11

And so that's a provision in which Congress

12

did exactly what my friend says it was trying to do

13

here.

14

nonappealable is the decision that no new question has

15

been raised, and therefore, this proceeding will not be

16

instituted.

It said that the only thing that is final and

17

Here, the ­­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

19

the Federal circuit's reading in Portola ­­ Portola ­­

20

Portola where it basically had similar language and said

21

it's appealable only at the end?

22

MR. GANNON:

I ­­ we ­­ we think ­­ I'm ­­

23

I'm not sure which case Your Honor is discussing, but we

24

think that here, the ­­ the reading ­­ the language

25

that ­­ of the scope of what Congress has made final and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

nonappealable is the entire decision whether to

2

institute an inter partes review under this section.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Gannon, would you

4

look at the reply brief at page 19, and they give a

5

series of rulings that the Board might make that, under

6

your view, would be immune from any judicial review.

7

So the Board goes ahead and institutes an

8

IPR, even though the requester for that IPR has already

9

filed a parallel civil action, something that the

10

statute says should not happen.

11

reviewable, that wrong decision, under your view of it.

12

Is that ­­

13

MR. GANNON:

That would not be

We ­­ we think that they would

14

not be subject to an appeal.

15

left open the possibility of mandamus, and we understand

16

why it did that.

Because the phrase here is

17

"nonappealable,"

that doesn't necessarily rule out

18

mandamus.

19

The court of appeals here

We don't think that it would make sense to

20

have mandamus only at the end of the proceeding.

21

think that if mandamus were to happen, it should be the

22

way it would normally happen, at the time when the error

23

­­ the alleged error occurs, but it would be only

24

reserved for extraordinary circumstances.

25

We

The ­­ the party would go immediately to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

53
1

Federal circuit and say, we have a clear and

2

indisputable entitlement to relief here because the

3

agency is violating the statutes.

4

where there'd be expedited briefing, where the P tab

5

would not have invested all the resources into getting

6

to a decision on the merits before a court pulled it

7

back and said, you never should have gotten there.

That's something

8

So we do think that there may be

9

circumstances that satisfy mandamus where there could be

10

review of the Board's departure from statutory criteria,

11

but what Congress has spoken to here and made

12

nonappealable is the decision whether to institute

13

proceedings under the section.

14

Yes.

That's the statutory

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so the

district court reaches a judgment saying, you win based

on my reading of the patent, and then you can go to the

7

PTO and say, no, the reading of the patent of the

9

MR. GANNON:

Well, my understanding of

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was that the ­­ the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARRARD R. BEENEY

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. BEENEY:

5

Let me just begin by saying that as with the

6

government's brief, we heard nothing today that suggests

7

that the use of the ordinary­claim construction would

8

not accomplish Congress's purpose.

9

avoid is all of the bizarre harms that are caused by the

10

use of the broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient.

11

We have different results, demonstrable different

12

results, as the Chief Justice pointed out.

13

cases are cited in our brief where a patent is upheld in

14

the district court and then invalidated by the Board.

15

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
