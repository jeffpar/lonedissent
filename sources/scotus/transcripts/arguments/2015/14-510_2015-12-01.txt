ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY D. STROMMER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. STROMMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

11

The facts in this case are very complex, but

12

the legal question that is presented to you today is

13

relatively straightforward to state.

14

question is whether or not an individual or an entity

15

that reasonably relies on class­action tolling can, if

16

tolling is found to be ineffective at a later date, then

17

rely on the same facts to argue that equitable tolling

18

under Holland should apply.

19

And the legal

In the Irwin case, this Court specifically

20

cross­referenced American Pipe as an example of a

21

defective pleading that could satisfy equitable tolling.

22

American Pipe obviously being a class­action tolling

23

rule.

24
25

We read that cross­reference as a suggestion
that, under the right circumstances, if somebody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

reasonably relies on class­action tolling facts that

2

ultimately prove to be ineffective, that that individual

3

has the ability to ask the Court to find that equitable

4

tolling should apply.

5
6

If there is such a case, the facts of this
case really should satisfy this test.

7

The test is set forth in the Holland case.

8

Due diligence and extraordinary circumstances are the

9

two prongs that have to be satisfied.

10

Both of them are

well­satisfied in this case.

11

First, the Menominee Tribe relied on a

12

preexisting class action which dealt with almost

13

identical substantive claims against the United States.

14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
Ramah?

16
17

Are you talking about the

MR. STROMMER:

Yes.

Correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And ­­ and that was a ­­

19

a decision, unpublished decision by a district court.

20

It never went any further.

21

MR. STROMMER:

Well, it is still a certified

22

class, Justice Ginsburg, and the Menominee Tribe not

23

only is a member of that class but has, to date,

24

received a portion of several settlements that were

25

entered into in that class action and, in fact, is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

poised to receive another large payment in a settlement

2

that the class and the United States ­­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. STROMMER:

5

The issue ­­

­­ has asked the Court to

approve.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The issue that that case

7

settled or addressed was whether exhaustion was required

8

at all.

9

other court at that time who had addressed the issue had

10

required exhaustion.

11
12

Minimal research would have shown that every

Now, we'll go later to exhaustion­when.
That's a separate question.

13

So how could you reasonably rely on a lower

14

court decision that hasn't gone through the crucible of

15

appellate review without having done any research on

16

whether its premises were subject to dispute, reasonable

17

dispute, and rely on that?

18
19

MR. STROMMER:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

have a couple of answers to your question.

20

First of all, the United States did not

21

challenge the certification of the class in the Ramah

22

case.

23

the claims that were then in the case, miscalculation

24

claims, nor later on with additional claims ­­

25

Not when it was originally certified, based on

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they raised the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

argument just lost.

2

exhaustion requirement didn't meet the commonality prong

3

of class certification.

4

against it.

5

They raised the argument that the

MR. STROMMER:

So they did make an argument

Oh, they argued, but the

6

district court judge in the Ramah case reasonably, we

7

think, concluded that, because of the unique nature of

8

the claims that the Ramah class was seeking ­­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know that's what you

10

believe, but every other court up until that time had

11

said no, you needed to exhaust.

12

Now, we can go to a separate question of

13

exhaust­when later.

14

rely on that case to think that you didn't have to ­­

15

But how could you at that point

MR. STROMMER:

Well, the Menominee Tribe

16

didn't rely just on that case.

17

important factor that it relied on, but there was also

18

other factors that it relied on.

19

That case was an

23

Instead, it raised Rule 23 grounds as a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Strommer ­­
But then ­­
­­ all of this goes to

12

deciding whether the legal advice they received was

reasonable legal advice.

14

Do you have a single case in which legal advice has

15

qualified for equitable tolling?

16
17

I find that quite irrelevant.

MR. STROMMER:

No, Your Honor.

We can't

cite a single case for that, no.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're really ­­ you're

19

really arguing a ­­ a remarkable proposition, that if

you get bad legal advice, that justifies equitable

tolling.

MR. STROMMER:

It didn't prevent it.
Well, Your Honor, in the

context of class­action tolling, there is always a legal

7

judgment call made about whether or not class­action

8

tolling applies.

9

available as a fallback, if in fact that judgment was

And if equitable tolling is not

10

not made correctly and discovered many years later, then

11

the whole premise of class­action tolling, I think, is

12

undercut because any member of a class ­­ for example,

13

in the Cherokee Nation case where the district court

14

judge said absolutely nothing about presentment, nothing

15

about jurisdiction, the government didn't raise that

16

defense, focused only on Rule 23 issues ­­ in any case

17

in which a district court judge declines to certify a

class, if equitable tolling isn't available as a

fallback, then the most you could ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You ­­ you want us to ­­ to

limit our principle of erroneous legal advice justifies

erroneous equitable tolling only in class­action cases?

23

MR. STROMMER:

No.

I would frame it

slightly differently, Your Honor.

I'm sorry.
All of these decisions,

were they made with the advice of a lawyer?

20

And I have a sense that the Tribe was

21

concerned about its resources and that they were just

22

getting together and talking about this and deciding,

we're not going to win under the law, so we're not going

2
3

So ­­ but answer my question:

Was there

legal advice sought?

4

MR. STROMMER:

They relied on legal advice

5

provided by class counsel, who communicated with all

6

putative class members, and made it clear that the

7

tolling period would apply during the pendency of the

8

certification.

9

And they also made ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we disagree that that

10

was ­­ if we think that was unreasonable, what ­­ your

11

reading of what class counsel said, what would happen?

12

MR. STROMMER:

Well, we still think the

13

backdrop against which the Tribe was making the

14

decision ­­ which is as a member of a class that had

15

been certified where presentment had not been found to

16

be an obstacle because of the unique nature of the

17

claims at issue in the case ­­ should be an important

18

factor that this Court will factor into whether or not

19

equitable tolling should apply.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it has not been found by

21

a single district court, right?

22

that that single district court should have had such

23

power in the Tribe's mind that they didn't do the

24

presentment.

25

thing.

I mean, you're saying

And that ­­ that seems an extraordinary

It's just a single district court.

Alderson Reporting Company

A single

14
1

district court has no controlling authority over anyone

2

or anything other than that particular decision.

3

MR. STROMMER:

That's true, Your Honor.

And

4

that particular decision had a direct impact on the

5

Menominee Tribe because they were a member of the class.

6

They benefitted from that decision.

7

payments out of settlement that the United States and

8

class counsel had the court approve premised on the

9

court having jurisdiction to be able to approve them.

They received

10

They will benefit shortly next spring from another

11

proposed settlement where the class counsel, as well as

12

the United States, have proposed that the claims that

13

will be signed by parties will serve as the presentment

14

to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.

15
16

So yes, they did benefit, and that was not
an ­­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

They benefitted, but the

18

point is there is one court that says your Tribe can be

a member.

20

to the contracting officer.

21

Your ­­ your Tribe didn't present its claim

And so why can they be a member?

The judge

22

addresses that question, and he says, normally they

23

couldn't be a member, but they can here because this is

24

the kind of case that is attacking general practices of

25

the administration.

25

And

Well, I ­­ I would not agree

with one of your premises.
JUSTICE BREYER:

You probably wouldn't agree

with any of them.

2
3

But ­­ but ­­ but ­­

MR. STROMMER:

Not ­­ not your conclusion or

one of your premises.

4

But the premise that I disagree with ­­ that

5

I think is very important is that the Cherokee Nation

6

complaint alleged the same kinds of system­wide

7

short­fundings by the United States that were contained

8

in the Ramah complaint.

9

The Ramah complaint initially, when it was

10

certified, only included one category of claims, called

11

"miscalculation claims."

12

pendency of the Cherokee Nation case, additional claims

13

were added.

14

certification decision was issued, the claims were, for

15

all intents and purposes, the same, and they challenged

16

a systemic underfunding and short­funding by the

17

United States that was based on ­­ we know now from your

18

Court's decision in the Cherokee case as well as the

19

Ramah case ­­ on an incorrect reading of the law.

20

they implemented that, system­wide, the policies that

21

the Indian Health Service used to implement this

22

short­funding system were designed to short­fund tribes

23

because they were designed based off of the assumption

24

that they were not statutorily entitled to 100 percent

25

funding.

But later on, during the

I would disagree with part of

what you're suggesting, Your Honor, which is that the

2

Tribe only had one option, which was to file,

3

essentially, after the Cherokee Nation's certification

4

decision was issued.

5

decision that talked about presentment and jurisdiction.

6

The court ruled on garden­variety­Rule 23 reasons.

7

ordinarily, those reasons are not a basis for class

action tolling not to apply.

almost identical, the same kinds of garden­variety­Rule

Nation decision itself, I think there's every reasonable

reason to be able to rely on class action tolling.

The stamp­and­an­envelope quote is more than

22

So in fact, what we're talking about here is

a conundrum, because the six­year statute of limitations

25

jurisdictional.

It was later on found to be

jurisdictional as a result of the presentment

requirement, but the statute of limitations that would

And if we place these facts on top of

13

would have triggered a statute of limitations that was

fact, going to still be alive.

17
18

And that would have happened before the end
of the 707 days.

19

So it's more than a stamp in an envelope.

It really is a jurisdictional conundrum that the Tribe

was aware of and concerned about, that partially

factored into the Tribe's decision not to file a claim.
