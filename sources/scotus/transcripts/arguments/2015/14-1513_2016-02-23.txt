ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The Federal Circuit has developed such a ­­

13

a rigid test for enhanced damages in patent infringement

14

cases that a large number of the worst infringers, even

15

bad­faith copiers, are not ­­ are immunized from any

16

enhancement.

17
18
19
20
21

The Federal Circuit has done that by moving
away from historical practice in two key ways.
First, it's made the test all about
recklessness rather than also intent.
Second, it judges recklessness based on

22

legal defenses developed in litigation rather than the

23

facts at the time of the infringement.

24
25

The net result, now that this Court in
Octane and Highmark set aside a similarly artificial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

test for fees is a one­of­its­kind, good for

2

patent­damages­only framework that does not track the

3

enhancement statute's text, history, or purposes.

4

It was not always this way.

5

years, district courts conducted a totality inquiry

6

subject to deferential review.

7

they said the nature of the infringement has to be more

8

than negligent if it's going to be an aggravating factor

9

that counsels in favor of an enhancement.

10

That ­­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

For nearly 150

And as part of that,

But is that ­­ is that

12

what you're advocating, to return to that, just as a

13

matter of discretion, for the district court and that's

14

it?

15

MR. WALL:

In a word, yes.

We do think that

16

there are principles to guide district courts'

17

discretion, because historically, district courts said

18

certain things.

19

think we all agree on, or at least Petitioners and the

20

PTO do, is the court said in the totality, if the

21

patentee wants to point to the nature of the

22

infringement and say that pulls you out of the mine run

23

of cases and that warrants an enhancement, it had to be

24

more than negligent.

But the one agreed­upon principle I

It was a traditional, willfulness inquiry.

It was not the willfulness inquiry that the Federal

5

example?

11

MR. WALL:

Well, I think there was some

12

litigation misconduct here, and we cited in the district

13

court's opinion that Zimmer did conceal some things in

14

the run up to trial.

15

some other factors.

16

instance, in Stryker, was the nature of the

17

infringement; that they hired an independent contractor,

18

they handed the contractor a patented product; they

19

said, essentially, Make one of these for us.

So I think there ­­ there were

That would seem to be a separate

So what is the issue

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7

2

before us?
MR. WALL:

Yeah.

I ­­ I don't want to say

3

that you have to.

4

litigation misconduct, because in a number of the older

5

cases, it was something like concealment, which was post

6

infringement but prelitigation, so it was a broader

7

category of misconduct.

8

And I want to be careful about

But no.

I think the only reason that we and

9

the PTO have pointed to the compensation cases and the

10

misconduct cases is just to show that for 150 years it

11

was a totality inquiry, and district courts were looking

12

at a lot of different things.

13

These cases are primarily about the nature

14

of the infringement.

15

think if the Court wanted to provide guidance to the

16

Federal Circuit about how to run the statute, it should

17

say go back to doing a totality inquiry, and here's some

18

of the principles that historically guided your exercise

19

of discretion.

20

Justice Alito.

Most cases will be like that.

But I don't think you have to do that,

Yes, they copied it, but perhaps they had a,

3

So the fact that they copied it doesn't seem to me to

4

automatically make it something which is suitable for

5

sanctions.

had, you know, a good­faith belief that the patent

MR. WALL:

Sure.

And that's exactly

13

historically how cases played out, and it's how they

14

should play out once this Court takes care of Seagate,

15

which is both parties come in at the enhancement stage;

16

most of the evidence has come in on infringement for

17

liability or damages.

18

And the patentee will say, you copied a

19

patented product and haven't shown any evidence that you

20

had a reasonable belief in invalidity.

And the defendant, if the patentee has

call faced with those competing narratives about what

the right answer is based on the facts.

3

Our point is that that judgment call that

4

district courts were making for a very long time has

5

essentially been stripped from them because it no longer

6

matters.

7

as Zimmer did, what the Federal Circuit says is, if you

8

can hire good lawyers and come up with defenses in

9

litigation, you'll be off the hook.

Even if you acted intentionally at the time,

10

And as Justice Breyer pointed out in the

11

Octane litigation ­­ and I now know it's true from

12

preparing for this case, you can ­­ a patent lawyer can

13

virtually always come up with some nonfrivolous defense

16
17

And that's why, in effect, what you have

JUSTICE BREYER:

That may be.

But this is

my question on this.

18

The statute doesn't say anything.

The

19

statute just says:

20

increase the damages up to three times the amount found

21

or assessed.

In either event, the Court may

You've read

We

10

infringer not only didn't know it was faulty, but also

11

was a big company that was pretty used to getting these

12

lawyers' opinions, and also pretty used to asking their

13

own experts whether it really was a good patent or not.

14

And they didn't do it here.

that?

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer, we tried in

opening brief to embrace the full totality of

circumstances, including the strength of the patent, the

industry.

21

The one point I just want to make, because I

22

think it's very important, is to get into the

23

recklessness box at common law, and traditionally, you

24

had to show an objectively high risk.

you've got to show to the judge, not just that

You're not going

You shouldn't be able to

I think the strength of the PTO's argument

11

fact that it can't shows you that you've really skewed

12

the incentives.

13

of horribles you're worried about are the people who can

14

infringe, knowing that they can discount by the

15

probability that they'll be found to have infringed in

16

litigation with virtually no back­end penalty, even if

17

they were a very bad infringer, as Zimmer was here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We agree with the Federal Circuit and with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

all the parties to this case that mere negligence is not

2

enough to trigger enhanced damages.

3

Federal Circuit is wrong to categorically bar such

4

damages whenever an infringer presents an objectively

5

reasonable defense at trial.

6

arbitrary loophole that allows some of the most

7

egregious infringers to escape enhanced damages.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the

That role creates an

The enhanced damages that

we're discussing really is almost entirely punitive if

10

the octane standard for attorneys' fees remains in

11

effect.

12

a judge much more latitude to impose ­­ to award

13

attorneys' fees when there's been unnecessary

14

resistance.

15

damages.

In other words, an octane standard is ­­ gives

So all we're talking about is punitive

16

MR. MARTINEZ:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I ­­ I ­­
And you ­­ and you want to

18

just basically dismantle the willfulness structure that

19

the court of appeals has established; is that correct?

20

MR. MARTINEZ:

No.

I think that's not

21

correct.

22

the law in a good direction or a better direction when

23

it reversed its Underwater Devices standard which it

24

said was akin to negligence, and it tried to tighten the

25

law versus ­­ about willfulness up to make it harder to

I think the Federal Circuit, in our view, took

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

get enhanced damages.

2

We think that was a step in the right

3

direction, but we think that they made two important

4

mistakes when they did that.

5

essentially that they said that in a case where you have

6

subjective intent, that, in and of itself, is not enough

7

to establish a case for enhanced damages.

8

that you have to prove recklessness under an objective

9

standard in each and every case.

10

The first one is

Essentially

We don't think that's consistent with the

11

history of the statute, with the purpose of the statute,

12

with the way punitive damages have ­­ have always been

13

considered, with the way willfulness has always been

14

interpreted.

15

So we think that's wrong.
The second mistake we think that the

16

Federal Circuit made is with respect to how the

17

recklessness inquiry is supposed to happen.

18

recklessness, everyone agrees, is an objective inquiry.

19

And in every other area of law where courts are

20

conducting an objective inquiry, what you ­­ what you're

21

supposed to do is you're supposed to take a reasonable

22

man, and you put him in the ­­ the actual person who is

23

accused of wrongdoing, in his shoes.

24

that actual person knew, and you figure out whether a

25

reasonable man in that person's shoes would have thought

Alderson Reporting Company

So

And you take what

Official

22
1

that there was a very high risk that the conduct at

2

issue was unlawful.

3

And what the Federal Circuit does is not

4

that.

5

reasonable man and giving him the benefit of

6

omniscience, giving him the benefit of hindsight and

7

saying, what facts do we know at the time of trial?

8

now that we know these facts at the time of trial,

9

should we retroactively sort of ­­

What they are essentially doing is taking the

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't think they were

11

doing that.

12

we are not going to allow punitive damages in a case

13

where the patent is so weak.

14

looking at state of mind.

15

And

I thought what they were doing was saying,

And so we're really not

And the reason that we're doing that is the

16

reason I said previously.

17

leaving it up to 475 trial judges is because those 475

18

trial judges don't see patent cases very much.

19

where they have a pretty good idea of how employment

20

law, tort law, and all kinds of other law works, they

21

don't have that, a good idea in respect to patent law.

22

And the reason that we're not

And we, the Federal Circuit, do.

And

That's why

23

we are created.

24

this objective standard, what we will see is a major

25

effect discouraging invention because of fear that if we

And we are afraid that if we do not use

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

try to invent, we'll get one of these letters and we

2

can't afford $100,000 for an opinion.

3

Now, I've just repeated the same argument.

4

But we did create the government, that expert court to

5

make such determinations in the face of language that

6

seems to allow it, and so what is wrong with they're

7

doing what they were paid to do?

8
9

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think there are ­­ there

are a couple things that are wrong with ­­ with that.

10

Because I think the first thing that they're paid to do

11

is to look to the text and history of the statute.

12

the text is ­­ as you said, doesn't provide a

13

categorical ­­ is silent.

14

of categorical bar that the Federal Circuit is asking

15

for.

16

And

It doesn't provide the kind

And the history of the statute affirmatively

17

undermines that categorical bar because the history

18

makes clear that subjective bad intent, the ­­ the

19

wanton and malicious pirate that this Court talked about

20

in the Seymour case, that is a sufficient basis to

21

enhance damages.

22

With respect to the recklessness standard,

23

the fact that ­­ that recklessness is objective, we all

24

agree with that.

25

objective analysis in a different way in this context

But there's no reason to conduct the

from the way that it's conducted in every other context.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I just gave you the

5

reason.

6

reason and give me a reason why it's wrong, but just to

7

say it's no reason is disturbing.

8
9

Now, you can say that you don't agree with that

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think ­­ I think that

the reason you gave is that ­­ I think, of concern that

10

we share, which is that we think it's important in cases

11

where a patent is of questionable validity.

12

it's important to encourage people in certain cases to

13

challenge the patent or to make sure that innovation is

14

not being stifled.

15

standard test for recklessness in our test accommodates

16

that concern because it would treat a reasonable

17

good­faith belief that a patent is invalid or that

18

infringement is not occurring as a reason to conclude

19

that enhanced damages are off the table.

20

We think

And we think that the ordinary

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As I read your brief

21

and the Petitioner's brief, I got the sense that there

22

was quite a bit of difference between the two.

24

before these punitive damages, or however you want to

25

describe them, would be allowed.

Your friend uses terms like, you

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think there's some minor

6

differences.

7

maybe what the differences are.

8
9

Is that

Let me explain how we see our standard and

We think our standard covers three different
buckets of cases.

The first bucket ­­ and this is borne

10

out by the history ­­ the first bucket are cases in

11

which there's intentional conduct or bad­faith conduct

12

under a subjective standard, a subjective analysis.

13

That's bucket number one.

14

But ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just a ­­ for one

15

just brief moment.

16

intentional infringement, not intentional ­­

17

By "intentional," you mean

MR. MARTINEZ:

No.

Intentional conduct by a

18

person who believes that he is infringing a valid

19

patent.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. MARTINEZ:

Okay.

In other words, if you have a

22

good­faith belief that the patent is not valid and that

23

belief's reasonable, we don't think you're an

24

intentional infringer.

25

The ­­ the second bucket covers recklessness

cases.

2

an objective standard.

3

side is we think it's judged based on the facts and the

4

circumstances that are known to the actual infringer at

5

the time of infringement.

6

And we all agree that recklessness is judged by
Where we disagree with the other

And then the third bucket that we think

7

is ­­ would qualify for enhanced damages are cases

8

involving other types of egregious misconduct not having

9

to do with the infringement itself.

For example, if

10

there's corporate espionage, if one of the parties

11

destroyed evidence.

12

I think the difference between us and

13

Petitioner is very minor.

14

enhanced damages for certain purely compensatory

15

purposes, even when a case did not fall into the other

16

three buckets.

17

I think they would also allow

We ­­ we can have a ­­ a interesting

18

historical discussion about whether or not that ­­ that

19

basis for damages is warranted or not.

20

the Court needs to resolve that in this case, because

21

it's not presented.

22

to those three buckets:

23

conduct, reckless conduct, and other types of egregious

24

litigation misconduct.

25

I don't think

But we do think our test is limited
Essentially, intentional

We think that ­­ that that test is ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
the word "willfulness."

MR. MARTINEZ:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me?

the word "willfulness."

That avoids the use of

MR. MARTINEZ:

And I think ­­ we

think there is ­­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. MARTINEZ:

But the bucket is there.

There's a sort of semantic

10

element to this case.

11

that ­­ those three buckets to encompass willfulness, I

12

think we wouldn't stand in the way of that.

13

problem that we see with what the Respondents are trying

14

to do is that they're looking to the history, the

15

pre­1952 cases, and they're taking the word "willful"

16

out of that.

17

they're defining it in a way that's at odds with the way

18

in which willfulness or the way in which the standard

19

was applied before 1952.

I think if you wanted to use

I think the

They're plucking that word out, and then

20

We think if ­­ if history is the

21

justification for imposing a willfulness requirement in

22

the first place, history has to provide the guide for

23

interpreting what willfulness means or what the standard

24

is.

25

And I think that ­­ that one of the ironies

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

of the Respondents' position is that they agree that

2

this statute is ­­ Section 284 is trying to get at

3

culpable infringers.

4

culpability.

5

It's ­­ the touchstone is

And they agree that recklessness is culpable

6

enough to get you into enhanced damages world.

7

everyone agrees, everyone in the civil law and the

8

criminal law, intentional misconduct has always been

9

considered worse than reckless conduct.

And yet,

And yet, their

10

test would allow a class of intentional infringers to

11

essentially get out of jail free based on their ability

12

to hire a lawyer and come up with a ­­ a post hoc

13

defense and present that defense at trial.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I ask ­­
Why isn't that post hoc

defense necessarily ­­ you're almost reading it as

17

unreasonable, by definition.

18
19
20

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think it's possible to

imagine ­­ let me ­­ let me make it concrete.
Imagine a case in which there's intentional

21

violation or a reckless violation based on the facts

22

known at the time.

23

the infringer is sued, and he hires a law firm that

24

scours the world, and they find the library in Germany

25

that has a Ph.D. dissertation that has some patents that

aware of it at the time the infringement occurred.

It wasn't in anyone's head.

Thank you, counsel.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Before I get into the substance of my

least in response to the characterizations by my ­­ from

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, it does.
So why are you here?

If ­­ no, no, no.

It's ­­

24

all I'm suggesting is that ­­ that it's a

25

mischaracterization of the ­­ of the facts to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

this involves purely copying, beginning from the very

2

outset of the process.

3

That's not to say that there couldn't be an

4

argument somewhere along the line that they ­­ that

5

there ­­ there might have been an argument of

6

willfulness.

7

mean, in a lot of ways this case comes down to sort of

8

trolls versus pirates in terms of how you want to

9

analyze it.

But this is not a classic copying case.

I

And our view is ­­ and ­­ and I thought the

10

example that the Solicitor General's office just offered

11

you tells you everything you should know about this.

12

His ­­ his criticism is that a good lawyer

13

is hired and goes off and searches in the German

14

libraries and finds some basis upon which to challenge

15

legitimately the validity of that patent.

16

Now, if it had turned out that in those

17

German sources they had, in fact, demonstrated that that

18

patent was invalid, the position of the world would be

19

that's great, because this patent should be declared

20

invalid and the monopoly that attaches to it should be

21

declared null and void and unenforceable.

22

The fact that they found it and it turns out

23

not to get you over the hump shouldn't be, by any

24

stretch of the imagination, lead to a ­­ to a standard

25

of the law that discourages us from going out and trying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33

to find both the limits of the metes and bounds of the

2

patent itself as ­­ as defined by the ­­ by the patent

3

holder, and to challenge the invalidity of those patents

4

under all circumstances.

5

And Justice Breyer, I mean, that goes to the

6

core point that you were making.

7

about a situation here where it's obvious when something

8

is infringed.

9

of thousands of patents.

We're not talking

19

that in a world of patent and copyright protection, I

think it's unfortunate that Congress hasn't passed a

21

special regime for those kinds of patents, but they

22

haven't.

23

In that such ­­ in that a world like that,

24

we're seeing more and more companies that have more and

more, and continuously more patents.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

I always ­­ I always

appreciate it when you anticipate I'm going to make a

15

good point before I make the good point, but ­­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Phillips, I ­­ I ­­

17

there's a whole lot of worry articulated by

18

Justice Breyer and reflected in your briefs about

19

protecting innovation.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
But there's not a whole

22

lot of worry about protecting the patent owner.

23

forget that historically enhanced damages were

24

automatic, and they were automatic because of a policy

25

judgment that owning a patent entitled you to not have

Alderson Reporting Company

I can't

Official

1

people infringe willfully or not willfully.

2

accept that at some point there was a different judgment

3

made that ­­ that good­faith infringers should be

4

treated differently than other infringers, willful

5

infringers.

6

And I

But I don't know that that swung things so

7

far the other way that it can only be that, if you come

8

up with something, any defense whatsoever in the

9

litigation that's not frivolous, that that gets you out

10

of enhanced damages.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ a similar protection

22

without an artificial test that I don't think is

23

right ­­

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
­­ where ­­ where do I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

go?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, let ­­ let me at least

3

correct one portion of the statement because you said

4

that ­­ enough to put forward that it's not frivolous.

5

I ­­ I don't think that's the appropriate standard.

6

Objective reasonableness is the requirement

7

that the Federal Circuit has looked at, and I think

8

that's more than simply the ability to satisfy Rule 11.

9

I think there has to be a substantial defense.

And

10

substantial defenses were put forward in both of these

11

cases.

Indeed these were, in both instances, close

12

cases.

So I would hope that that's where the Court

13

would ­­ would focus its attention.

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the different

court called it differently in the second case.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But again, I think

17

it's important to look at the ­­ the way the court of

18

appeals analyzed it.

19

you ­­ and it's the reason why you have to have an

20

experienced, an expert court of appeals looking at these

21

issues on an objective ­­ on the ­­ on the basis of an

22

objective analysis because they are the ones who have

23

seen these kinds of claim­construction issues, have seen

24

these kinds of infringement issues.

25

position to be able to say, this is objectively

And the reality is I think if

Alderson Reporting Company

They're in the best

Official

40

reasonable and, therefore, not something on which

2

enhanced damages should be added.

3

What I think it's important to put in

4

context, because you're going through the history of

5

this, is to ­­ is, again, to look at the difference

6

between Section 284 as it evolved and the ­­ and the

7

meaning of Section 285.

8
9

I mean, this Court last term said
Section 285 has now ­­ has now ­­ it's not essential or

goes into the portion that talks about whether you get

And yet the Federal

Circuit standard, you've got ­­ you know, you've got

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41

heightened burdens of proof, particularly articulated.

2

I mean, the way we ­­ the ­­ courts have been used to

3

dealing with discretionary standards for a long time.

4

And the way it works is, historically, you know, the

5

exercise of discretion in a lot of cases that, you know,

6

wears a channel which kind of confines the exercise of

7

discretion.

8

based on that history.

9

And I think the other side's argument is

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Right.

And ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Over time, this is

11

what discretion has ­­ has given us in this area, and

12

therefore, you get beyond that, it's an abuse.

13

erect this fairly elaborate standard on the basis of

14

that language I think is surprising.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

But to

I ­­ I ­­ I understand that,

16

and that's why I think you have to take it one step at a

17

time.

18

First of all, you ­­ you quoted one portion

19

of the language of ­­ of 284.

20

on particularly is the ­­ you begin with damages

21

adequate to compensate for the infringement.

Alderson Reporting Company

only ­­ you know, that ­­ those damages are one and the

2

same.

3

Then you get to the point where Seagate

4

says, if we don't have a strong enough standard of

5

recklessness and willfulness and an objective standard

6

that can be examined by us independently, the downside

7

risks and the harm to the economy is ­­ is very

8

substantial.

9

of these letters being sent, litigation.

10

There have been ­­ there are huge numbers
It skews every

aspect of it.

11

And then Congress comes back in the America

12

Invents Act, and through the process leading up to the

13

America Invents Act, Seagate comes into being, and ­­

14

and the ­­ and the Federal Circuit takes a very hard

15

look at it.

16

Congress looks at that and says, we're not

17

going to change Section 284 because, in light of

18

Seagate, that willfulness standard, which is the

19

standard the Court was very explicit about, that helped

20

solve the problem that all of us had been concerned

21

about.

22

The Congress didn't just leave it at ­­ at

23

where you have to infer this from silence or inaction by

24

Congress.

25

Section 298 it talks about opinions of counsel and what

Congress passed the Section 298.

Alderson Reporting Company

And in

Official

43
1
2

role they play in the willfulness determination.
It seems to me, in order to give Section 298

3

any significant meaning, you have to have concluded,

4

then, that 284 necessarily incorporates a standard of

5

willfulness even though, obviously, it's not in the

6

language, but that's ­­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I don't know how far

8

that gets you, Mr. Phillips, because Mr. Martinez just

9

told us that he'd be happy to call willfulness his test.

10

And willfulness has meant different things

11

to different people here.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
And there's nothing that

14

Congress did that suggests that, when it used that word

15

"willfulness," it really meant the Seagate test.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the only test in front

17

of it at the point ­­ at that point in time was Seagate

18

because Seagate was the definition of what 284 was about

19

and what the standard of willfulness was about.

20

But I think what's equally important,

21

Justice Kagan, is ­­ I'll ­­ I'll concede that

22

willfulness can have a lot of different meanings, but

23

the meaning that the Seagate court adopted was the ­­

24

was the meaning this Court adopted in Safeco.

25

interesting because my friends did not ­­ didn't say the

Alderson Reporting Company

And it's

Official

44
1

word "Safeco" at all in their 25 minutes of

2

presentation.

3

But ­­ and this is why it's not such a big

4

jump, Mr. Chief Justice, because what ­­ what Seagate

5

said is what's ­­ what's the best source for trying to

6

come up with a sensible way of applying willfulness?

7

And ­­ and they looked at Safeco, and they said, you

8

know, the ­­ the best way to do it is with a

9

recklessness standard.

That's an objective

10

determination.

11

subjective, bad ­­ bad intent is off the table.

12

that's footnote 20 of the Safeco opinion, and the Court

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Sotomayor.

22

absolute critical elements that you need to take out of

24

would lead you to affirm in both instances on the facts

of these cases.

And I suppose, in some

What are you ­­ what are the

And candidly, both

assessment of whether or not there is a reasonably

objective set of circumstances that allow the defendant

to say this ­­ either these patents are invalid, or we

do not infringe those patents.

6

And two, you have to have that reviewed

7

nondeferentially by the Federal Circuit in order to

8

ensure that the 500 or 400 ­­ I forget how many district

tangent and ­­ and that we get the consistent review by

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

The recklessness decision

14

here seems different from those that generally come up.

15

But maybe you can provide an example where this occurs

16

outside of this context.

17

Usually, to determine whether someone was

18

reckless, you have to assess the ­­ the nature of the

19

risk, the severity of the risk.

20

case, the severity of the risk may seem greater at the

21

time of trial than it did at the time of the

22

tortfeasor's action, because someone has been harmed.

23

But in this situation, the ­­ the degree of the risk

24

seems smaller at the time of the determination of

25

enhanced damages than it may have been at the time of ­­

And in the typical tort

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

of the infringement.

2

because it's a legal risk.

3

may not have been made with the assistance or very

4

intense analysis by attorneys, and then the latter time,

5

the attorneys are very much involved.

6
7

And the first determination

Is there any other situation where a
recklessness determination has those characteristics?

8
9

And I can't think of another ­­

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think ­­ I think the

copyright would probably be the other one that sort of

10

attends to it in the same way, because it's essentially

11

the same kind of an inquiry.

12

problem is it's the nature of the continuing tort

13

action, and it's also the fact that the infringement

14

determination is ­­ is a matter of strict liability.

15

So ­­ but, you know, there are a thousand obviously

16

different ways of ­­ different situations that can

17

arise.

I mean, part of the

is, there is no defense, there's no objective, they have

Justice Kennedy is there is a role for that kind of

assessment of this, and I think it's borne out by the

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, no.

But it did it

10

against the backdrop of the ­­ of the Seagate standard.

11

Because Seagate clearly made a judgment that as between

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the ­­ the ­­

20

the choice is reflected in the statute, which leaves a

21

lot of discretion to the district courts.

22

think ­­ and a lot of the arguments we've heard today

23

are the sort of arguments that can be made to the

24

district court's discretion in a particular case.

Saying, you know, this ­­ this is one of those pirates

And you have these standards to

And if it's out of the channel of

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

8

the problem with that is ­­ is that it ­­ unless you

9

come up with ­­ I mean, I ­­ you know, recklessness ­­

10

I ­­ or egregiousness ­­ I don't know what

11

"egregiousness" means, and I don't know how you ­­ how

12

you evaluate that on review.

13

I do know what it means to ­­ to take an

14

objectively reasonable position.

15

something that's beyond frivolous, it is a substantial

16

argument that either the patent doesn't extend to ­­ to

17

my particular product or the patent itself is invalid.

18

And circumstances where ­­ where that is true, my hope

19

would be that the Court, recognizing the extraordinary

20

importance of limiting patents and the monopolies that

21

flow from there, would drive the legal decision in this

22

context ­­ of the legal standard in this context exactly

23

where the ­­ where the Court adopted it in Seagate.

24
25

More than simply

That's the court that has the experience and
expertise, and I would hope under these circumstances,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

in this very unusual situation, because patent law in

2

this context I do think is very different than almost

3

any other tort context, I would hope in the one ­­ in

4

the ­­ in the decidedly one­sided approach that 284 is,

5

where it only gives to the plaintiffs the ability to do

6

what they can do and what they want, that the Court

7

would adopt the kind of rigorous objective standard that

8

allows both for the ­­ both for the determination that

9

the ­­ that the patent is invalid or doesn't infringe,

10
11
12

15

and that that's examined on an objective basis.
If there are no further questions, Your
Honors, I urge the Court to affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18

MR. WALL:

19

fairly simple points.

20

Mr. Chief Justice, I have two

The first is, as we and the PTO and many of

21

Respondents' amici recognize, the system as it currently

22

stands is out of balance.

23

believe we have succeeded, in crafting an approach that

24

balances the Court's concerns with the need to respect

25

the rights of patentees, including small companies like

And we have tried, and I

Alderson Reporting Company

Halo.

2
3

And we've done it in a couple of different
ways.

4

Reasonable, good­faith efforts to ­­ to

5

challenge patents are not going to result in enhanced

6

damages.

7

be and should not be easy to show.

8
9

And intent and recklessness are not going to

Now, the Federal Circuit hasn't adopted a
contrary approach based on its expertise.

It thought it

10

had to in light of this Court's decision in Safeco,

11

which it has misread.

12

reasonable view of the law at the time, you're not

13

acting willfully.

14

and correctly believe that you are violating the law,

15

you are held not to be willful because you have hired a

16

good lawyer and come up with a defense later.

17

Safeco says if you adopt a

It doesn't say if you subjectively

And that approach is what has skewed the

18

incentives in the patent system and taken us out of

19

balance.

20

Our approach incentivizes good, commercially

21

reasonable behavior under the full set of circumstances

22

at the discretion of the district court.

23

is incentivizing good litigation.

24
25

Their approach

And the second point I just want to make
quickly is we do have the evidentiary burden and

Alderson Reporting Company

standard of review in this case.

2

that the ­­ there isn't any basis for the clear and

3

convincing standard.

4

Highmark resolves and I think Pierce v. Underwood

5

resolves it.

I think it's clear

On the standard of review, I think

6

These are determinations bound up with the

7

facts, and just as the Court said in Pierce, whether a

8

litigating position is substantially justified is a

9

mixed question of fact and law.

So too the questions

10

here.

11

and it's very important for the Court to say that.

These should be reviewed for abuse of discretion,

12

Halo should go back to the district court

13

and be analyzed under the right standard so the

14

evidentiary burden matters.

15

In Stryker the district court actually got

16

to the discretionary way, did it, and on appeal, Zimmer

17

never challenged that as an abuse of discretion.

18

just argued about the objective prong.

19

It

When this Court takes that out of the

20

analysis, as it should, there's no basis to disturb the

21

district court's discretionary ruling.

22

knows from looking at it, it's a thorough and reasonable

23

opinion.

24
25

As the Court

So ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

One point Mr. Phillips

brought up that you didn't address in your initial

Alderson Reporting Company

1

argument, maybe you could say a word about it, is

2

Section 298 of the American ­­ America Invents Act.

3

Under your ­­ under your reading, could

4

evidence of the failure to obtain or introduce advice of

5

counsel be used to prove that the defendant infringed in

6

bad faith?

7

MR. WALL:

No.

The patentee cannot put that

8

at issue affirmatively.

9

a ­­ that very narrow problem.

All 298 does is it dealt with
And when the patentee

10

comes in and wants to show intent or recklessness, it

11

can point to your copying of the patent.

12

to the fact that it gave you really extensive, very

13

detailed notice.

14

didn't do anything.

15

talked to counsel.

It tried to license with you.

Now, the defendant maybe ­­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

under the language of 298?
MR. WALL:

You

It cannot put at issue whether you

16

19

It can point

How do you get to that point

Because 298 just says when you're

20

proving of willfulness, whether it's a factor as it is

21

in our approach, whether it's the end­all, be­all as it

22

is in their approach, whenever the patentee is trying to

23

prove that up, you can't affirmatively put that at

24

issue.

25

And as Pulse candidly, and I think honestly,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

concedes in its brief, you can read 298 to have effect

2

on either side's view of the ­­ how you ought to treat

3

the enhancement statute.

4

either way.

5

So I don't think 298 cuts

And I would just stress for the Court that

6

Congress at the time looked at putting "willfully" in

7

the statute, and it looked at putting something

8

virtually identical to Seagate in the statute.

9

didn't do either one, so I don't think it can be taken

10

to have ratified the Federal Circuit's current approach.
