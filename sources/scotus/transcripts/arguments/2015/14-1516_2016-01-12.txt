CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Ms. Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN E. SHAPIRO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MS. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Seventh Circuit in this case violated

11

AEDPA when it granted habeas relief to Respondent in the

12

absence of precedent from this Court, clearly

13

establishing that Respondent's allegations rise to the

14

level of a constitutional violation.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume the judge

16

said, instead of what he said ­­ so make the assumption

17

my way ­­ I don't know if the witnesses are telling the

18

truth or not, but I believe he's guilty.

19

about their credibility, but I believe he's guilty

20

because he wanted to get rid of this guy because of a ­­

21

a drug deal gone bad.

I'm not sure

22

Would that violate due process?

23

MS. SHAPIRO:

It would violate due process

24

if the judge did not find the element, the ­­ the ­­

25

that the evidence provided by the State proved the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

2

does not violate due process, or at least it does not

3

clearly establish that it would violate due process, for

4

the finder of fact to speculate about a nonelement of

5

the crime where it is ­­ where the finder of fact does

6

not disavow or otherwise ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it would ­­

Well, this isn't

8

speculation.

9

was a drug dealer; Larry Owens wanted to knock him off;

The judge said who ­­ Larry Owens knew he

10

I think the State's evidence has proved that fact;

11

finding of guilty of murder.

12
13

Proved that Larry Owens wanted to knock him
off?

14

MS. SHAPIRO:

The State's evidence did

15

establish that Larry Owens wanted to knock him off,

16

because the State's evidence established that Larry

17

Owens approached him and hit him over the head with a

18

baseball bat several times.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sorry, Ms. Shapiro.

Could

20

I ­­ could I take you back, because I just didn't

21

understand ­­ and I'm sure it was me ­­ the ­­ the

22

answer that you gave to Justice Sotomayor's first

23

question.

24
25

And I think it's important, because it
focuses on what the actual issue is here:

Alderson Reporting Company

How much is

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1
2

at issue between the parties?
If you had a judge that said, I don't think

3

the evidence is up to snuff here, and then said, the

4

thing that takes me over the line is what I think about

5

the defendant's motive, and that's what allows me to say

6

that the defendant is guilty, and that had not been

7

proved, that had ­­ the State had never offered that

8

into evidence.

9

head for whatever reason.

10
11
12

It really just came out of the judge's
Right?

Do you think that that would be a due
process violation?
MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think it would first

13

depend somewhat on if ­­ on habeas review on how the

14

State appellate court or supreme court interpreted the

15

record and interpreted what the judge had said.

16

State appellate court interpreted what the judge had

17

said so that the judge was saying he did not believe

18

that the evidence produced by the State proved the

19

elements beyond a reasonable doubt, that would be a

20

Winship error or a Jackson error, which is not

21

Respondent's claim here.

22

If the

If the State appellate court read the

23

record, interpreted the ­­ what the trial court said

24

differently and thought that the trial court did think

25

that the ­­ that the evidence was sufficient but was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

tying it together by trying to tell a story that made

2

sense to himself, then it would not violate ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Okay.

But then ­­ so

4

the first alternative that you gave, and you said it's

5

not the claim here, but I would have thought it was the

6

claim here because you ­­ there is obviously a dispute

7

about how to read these words.

8

the ­­ how to read these words.

9

And we can talk about
Right?

But once you say, as I think you said, and I

10

think you properly said, Look, if what the ­­ the

11

judge's various comments on motive was basically taking

12

him over the line, was ­­ that that was the basis for

13

the verdict of guilty, that he didn't think that all the

14

evidence, the other evidence was enough and that that

15

was crucial to his finding, then, if I understand you

16

right, you would say that's a due process violation

17

because at that point the verdict of guilty is based on

18

evidence that was never presented.

19

MS. SHAPIRO:

If the ­­ if the judge found

20

that the elements had not been proven beyond a

21

reasonable doubt.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the judge is just

23

saying it's not ­­ you know, this is not enough, and

24

it's necessary for me to think about motive as the

25

missing piece.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

MS. SHAPIRO:

That does not necessarily

2

violate due process because ­­ or it's ­­ it's certainly

3

not clearly established that that would necessarily

4

violate due process.

5

theory of the case that is not presented by the State as

6

long as it is consistent with the evidence and as long

7

as the evidence itself is sufficient to establish guilt

8

beyond a reasonable doubt.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Factfinders are free to develop a

Oh, I see.

So you think

10

that it doesn't matter if the judge thought that the

11

evidence was insufficient as long as the evidence was,

12

in fact, sufficient.

13
14
15

MS. SHAPIRO:

If the judge said that he

found the evidence insufficient, that would ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

The judge says, you

16

know, all of this evidence, it's not enough.

17

motive is critical to a finding of guilt here.

18

MS. SHAPIRO:

For me,

Again, it would depend on how

19

the ­­ the ­­ the State court, State appellate courts

20

interpreted the record.

21

you've described it, whether the judge is saying that he

22

finds that the elements have not been proven beyond a

23

reasonable doubt or if the judge is saying that he needs

24

to find some way of telling a story about this case that

25

makes sense to him.

I think that is ambiguous, as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1
2

The first would be a due process violation.
The second, it's not clearly established.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

I mean, so maybe I'm

4

putting words in your mouth, and so tell me if I am.

5

But what I just heard was, look, if he's just telling a

6

story to himself and he basically believes that the

7

evidence that was presented is enough, but he wants to

8

tell a story about some other things that make this all

9

make sense, that's one thing.

But ­­ but if he's really

10

filling in the pieces and deciding ­­ and ­­ and

11

determining guilt based on something that was never in

12

the record, that's another thing entirely, and that that

13

would run into all our statements about one accused of a

14

crime is entitled to have his guilt determined solely on

15

the basis of evidence at ­­ introduced at trial and so

16

forth.

17

MS. SHAPIRO:

It ­­ it ­­ yes, I ­­ but it

18

has to be quite clear that that's what's happening, both

19

because we have a presumption that judges know and

20

follow the law and especially on habeas review that

21

presumption applies with special force.

22

habeas review, we ­­ we assume not only that the

23

original trial judge knows and follows the law but that

24

the State courts that are reviewing his decision know

25

and follow the law.

Alderson Reporting Company

Because on

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So now I'm going to

2

go back to Justice Sotomayor's second question.

3

but, I mean, just take a look at what he said here.

4

right?

5

And ­­

His first sentence is, all of the witnesses

6

skirted the real issue.

7

witnesses ­­ there's something wrong with what we've

8

heard from all of the witnesses.

9

real issue.

10
11

All

Okay.

All right?

So all of the

They all skirted the

So what was the real issue?

What was

the real issue?

12

And then he says, the issue to me is that

13

you have a drug dealer on a bike who Larry Owens, the

14

defendant, knew was a drug dealer, and Owens wanted to

15

knock him off.

16
17

That's the real issue.

And then he says, the State's evidence has
proved that fact.

18

What's that fact?

Well, that fact is the

19

same thing that he's just said is the real issue, that

20

there was a drug dealer on the bike who knew ­­ and the

21

defendant knew he was a drug dealer and wanted to knock

22

him off.

23

And then he says, okay.

24

I mean, to me, I ­­ I guess with all the

25

deference in the world, it's just this judge saying,

Alderson Reporting Company

Finding of guilty.

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

there's something wrong with all the evidence that's

2

been given to me, and here's what's really moving me to

3

find him guilty.

4

MS. SHAPIRO:

So, first, if that were what

5

the judge said, that interpretation, it's not clearly

6

established that ­­ that that would violate due process,

7

for the reasons I've already said, that a finder of fact

8

can develop a theory of the case to tie it together that

9

is consistent with the evidence.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that ­­
But I thought it was

12

clearly established ­­ I thought you agreed ­­ page 14,

13

I think, of your reply brief ­­ that it is clearly

14

established that it would be a violation of ­­ of Taylor

15

and ­­ and Turner if the factfinder bases its verdict on

16

evidence not in the record.

17

MS. SHAPIRO:

On ­­ when we ­­ and when we

18

discussed that in our reply brief, we talked about the

19

possibility that a judge would say, I ­­ I ­­ I don't ­­

20

the evidence isn't sufficient so ­­ but I know that this

21

defendant's brother committed a similar crime, and for

22

that reason only I'm finding him guilty.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but to begin with,

24

we have a ­­ a general statement:

25

based ­­ pardon me ­­ the verdict must be based on the

Alderson Reporting Company

The evidence must be

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

evidence in the record.

Correct?

2

MS. SHAPIRO:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Correct.

MS. SHAPIRO:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
Then I don't see how ­­ I

don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan.

8
9

And we agree

with that.

5

7

All right.

MS. SHAPIRO:

The ­­ the precedent can be

read ­­ that ­­ that language can be read at a very high

10

level of generality, which is not appropriate for AEDPA

11

review.

12

Under due process ­­ and it's especially

13

important when we're talking about due process­claims

14

that this Court respect AEDPA's requirement that the

15

clearly established law have a certain level of

16

specificity.

17

every defendant is entitled to a fair trial, but that

18

alone does not mean that every allegation of a fair

19

trial ­­ by ­­ of an unfair trial ­­

20

Of course, it's clearly established that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But here, the issue is,

21

was the defendant convicted on the basis of information

22

that wasn't in the record.

23

to answer that if it's clearly established, that a

24

conviction must be based on evidence presented at the

25

trial ­­

And I think you would have

4

MS. SHAPIRO:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MS. SHAPIRO:

7

But in ­­ and in this case, it's important

8

to note that the Illinois Appellate Court reviewed the

record, and the Illinois Appellate Court concluded that

leaves it to a one­witness ID of a witness who ­­ who,

at best, saw the defendant once, when he turned around

Several ­­ several answers to

First, Mr. Johnnie's testimony, which the
appellate court discussed at some length and which the

is:

3

that it was credible, or that the judge found it

4

You say that Johnnie's testimony was sufficient.

I

But what they didn't say was

Those are two different findings.

5

MS. SHAPIRO:

Certainly.

The judge must

6

have found it credible, because if he didn't believe

7

Johnnie, we ­­ what ­­ what you would have to presume is

8

that this judge said, well, I don't think that the State

9

witnesses have established the elements beyond a

10

reasonable doubt.

11

So I'm going to disregard one of the most basic ­­

12
13

I don't think Johnnie is credible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

All the judge had

to say was, I'm not sure he's credible.

14

And what takes me over the line is this

15

motivation, this theory that I have.

16

MS. SHAPIRO:

It is not clearly established

17

that that theory, in this ­­ in this situation would ­­

18

would violate due process where it is consistent with

back to Justice Kennedy's question, I guess.

satisfaction by review ­­ by coming up with a theory

I'm saying several things.

But in addition ­­

I agree with you that

4

there's a question of interpretation.

seems to me like everything comes down to that.

6

if you thought that this judge just made up facts and ­­

Let me give you a hypothesis

20

of what he may have been saying, because I think this

21

may be a little bit too hard on the judge.

22

This was an unusual prosecution.

It was a

23

murder prosecution where there was no evidence of

24

motive.

25

been saying something like this:

I think that's pretty rare.

The judge may have

I have ­­ I have

identification evidence here.

2

And by the way, I ­­ I read the ­­ the

3

whole ­­ everything ­­ the whole record and ­­ that's in

4

the appendix and the closing argument of defense

5

counsel.

6

these were witnesses who made an honest mistake.

7

just didn't get a good opportunity to see the ­­ to see

8

the perpetrator.

9

as I read it very clearly, was that something was going

There was no ­­ the defense here was not that
They

The ­­ the ­­ argument of the defense,

10

on here and these two witnesses were identifying ­­

11

were ­­ were falsely ­­ knowingly identifying the wrong

12

person.

13

Something was going on.
There's evidence that the victim was selling

14

drugs, very strong evidence that the victim was selling

15

drugs, and that's what was going on here.

16

judge said ­­ may have said to himself, why does the ­­

17

the ­­ why would the accused take a baseball bat and

18

beat this kid, this 17­year­old kid who has a lot of

drugs in his pockets, riding around on a bike?

20

would he just beat this kid to death?

21

And so the

Why

And there ­­ he ­­ I would be concerned

22

about finding this ­­ the defendant guilty if I thought

23

there was no motive in this case.

24

there could well be a motive in this case, because

25

people in the drug trade kill each other.

Alderson Reporting Company

But I can see that

And that

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

20
1

seems to be exactly what was going on here.

2

is that not a fair interpretation of what the judge was

3

saying?

4

MS. SHAPIRO:

Is that ­­

I think that's an extremely

5

fair interpretation of what the judge was saying.

6

think it is consistent also with what the Illinois

7

Appellate Court said when the Illinois Appellate Court

8

said that the speculation about motive was not a

9

material factor in ­­ in the verdict.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no.

And I

It actually said

­­ so I've been looking at this because it puzzles me

12

what standard we're supposed to use.

13

there's no evidence that the two eyewitnesses knew each

other, had any reason to conspire and fabricate their

15

testimony.

The other way to read it is that notwithstanding the

that's the case, there's still nothing to give deference

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEVENSTAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

21

The Illinois Appellate Court unanimously

22

found that there was no evidence that Mr. Owens knew

23

Mr. Nelson was dealing drugs, or that he was himself

24

involved with gangs or with the illegal drug trade.

25

subsequently, the presentence report revealed that he

had no convictions whatsoever.
The Court then said that this was ­­ by a

3

two­to­one margin ­­ this was harmless error.

4

recognize that harmlessness is entitled to deference,

5

and I intend to discuss that.

6

really, we're past the ­­ the point of ­­ of whether

7

there was evidence concerning knowledge.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

into your decision matters that were not in the record

that had no support in the evidence, if that's what you

13

mean by error, it's one thing.

you mean by error using evidence that was not in the

record as a basis for your decision.

me, based on what he said, after saying ­­ expressing

what the real issue was to him ­­ and I have yet to be

in front of a trial court making a, you know, bench

23

24

than what he has to decide to ­­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27
1

presumption that the judge knows and applies the law?

2

And I don't think there's a rational judge who would

3

think it proper to base a conviction on conjecture that

4

has no evidentiary basis.

5

presume the judge knows and applies the law, and that is

6

he knows the defendant must be convicted on the basis of

7

evidence presented in court.

8
9
10
11

MR. LEVENSTAM:

So if we add to this that we

Well, there are two

presumptions at ­­ at ­­ at work, in a sense.

This is a

morning seems filled with presumptions.
The presumption that he knows the law, I

12

think, is absolutely correct.

13

presumption is a reason why we know that he found motive

14

an integral part of his conclusion of guilt, and that is

15

because the Illinois Supreme Court decided the People v.

16

Smith case in 1990, and it reversed a conviction that

17

was based on identification that rested on motive.

18

it said it is essential, if you are going to convict

19

someone based on a motive theory, that you find the

20

knowledge that the accused have the actual knowledge

21

necessary to generate the motive.

22

And I think that

And

And when he makes that finding, who ­­

23

defendant knew he was a drug dealer, he is going through

24

the paces in Illinois law to establish the motive that

25

is then the basis for the following finding of guilty of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think we've gotten

pretty far afield from the issue here.

4

Which case of ours clearly established that

5

it's due process­error when a judge speculates about an

issue that is not pertinent to guilt and there's

7

sufficient evidence of guilt on all the elements?

case of ours says that?

framing what the issue is to him, he says that Mr. Owens

knew that this victim was a drug dealer and wanted to

knock him off, presumably because he's a drug dealer.
