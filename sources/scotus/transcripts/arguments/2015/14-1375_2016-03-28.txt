Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

On the issue we initially asked this Court

12

to resolve in the petition for certiorari, the parties

13

are now in complete agreement.

14

was whether a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case

15

is barred from seeking attorneys' fees if it hasn't

16

prevailed on the merits.

17

brief, such a rule, which exists only in the

18

Eighth Circuit, makes little sense.

19

certainly not compelled by the statutory language and

20

doesn't serve any rationing statutory policy to take

21

away the power of work fees in a ­­ in a case of a

22

non­merits disposition.

23

That issue, of course,

As we showed in our opening

It doesn't ­­ it is

The EEOC, having staunchly defended that

24

rule in its brief in opposition, executed an about­face

25

in its merits brief and now agrees with us that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

non­merits disposition can be the basis of a defendant

2

attorneys' fee award under Title VII.

3

Now, for that reason and for all the reasons

4

in our opening merits brief, which the government

5

apparently found convincing, at least, we would suggest

6

that the Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's

7

ruling and resolve the circuit conflict and rule that

8

prevailing defendants can seek fees as long as they meet

9

the Christiansburg standard, whether or not the

10
11
12
13

disposition was on the merits.
If there are no questions about that, the
second issue is, what do we do ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't the standard

14

whether the EEOC's actions were frivolous, unreasonable,

15

or without foundation?

16

MR. SMITH:

17
18
19

That's the Christiansburg

standard, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what difference does

it make on what ground it was dismissed?

20

MR. SMITH:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I couldn't agree more.
I've been reading these

22

briefs, and with or without prejudice, merits,

23

non­merits, I don't know that even if a judge gets to

24

that point of deciding whether it was on the merits or

25

not, that's not enough.

You always have to decide the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

bottom line.

2

MR. SMITH:

Right.

But the Eighth Circuit's

3

ruling was that even if it was frivolous or unreasonable

4

or without foundation, if the reason it was frivolous or

5

unreasonable or without foundation was the fact that it

6

was res judicata, or was time­barred or something like

7

that ­­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There wasn't the

slightest suggestion of any frivolity or groundlessness
to this complaint.

11

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, there certainly is.

12

As the case turned out, they never had any foundation

13

whatever for bringing this class claim.

14

any pattern of practice that they could identify and ­­

15

and prove.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They never had

They ­­ the claim was

17

that many women had been harassed by lead drivers, not

18

one, but many.

MR. SMITH:

That was ­­ that was the

20

allegation, Your Honor.

21

claim ­­ a collective claim under Title VII, what the

22

EEOC needs is a pattern or practice, which means either

23

an express policy that's discriminatory or some

24

unexpressed standard operating procedure.

term the Court used in the Teamster's case.

But in order to bring a class

Alderson Reporting Company

That's the
In the

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

absence of that, what you have is a ­­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that was the

3

whole thing, that the ­­ the ­­ that the company was not

4

giving the lead drivers adequate training.

5

bluntly, they were not taking sexual harassment

6

seriously.

7

MR. SMITH:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

To put it

Your Honor ­­
That was ­­ that was the

complaint about the employer, that there were complaints

10

about these lead drivers, and the ­­ and the employer

11

just didn't take them seriously.

12

MR. SMITH:

But what became clear as the

13

case proceeded is that, A, the EEOC never investigated

14

any kind of pattern or practice at the investigatory

15

phase.

16

it ­­ when they started alleging that they had a pattern

17

of practice and telling the Court they wanted to go to

18

trial on a pattern of practice, we ­­ we filed a motion

19

for summary judgment and said, what is your evidence

20

that there's a consistent policy of disregarding these

21

complaints, that there is a consistent failure?

They only investigated two cases.

22

And ­­ and the ­­ and as Judge Reed found,

23

the evidence didn't remotely support that.

evidence ­­

25

And then when

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

The EEOC, when it was

Alderson Reporting Company

investigating this case, asked CRST, tell us about

2

complaints you've gotten of sexual harassment.

3

initially, the company came out with two names.

4

MR. SMITH:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

And

Your Honor ­­
There were well over a

hundred.

7

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the ­­ the EEOC's

8

suggestion that we did not answer their question

9

completely was looked at in detail both by the district

10

court and by the Eighth Circuit, and they both concluded

11

that the only ­­ the question at issue was a question

12

about people who had complained about the conduct at

13

issue in this case, meaning Ms. Starke ­­ Ms. Starke's

14

harassment.

15

answered that question completely was rejected by the

16

district court on Pages 168 and 69 of the Petition

17

Appendix.

18

factually baseless on Page 92 of the Petition Appendix.

19

They simply didn't ask a question that called for that

20

until later in the investigation.

21

what ­­ all the judges below, the ­­ the district judge

22

and the majority in the Eighth Circuit, concluded is we

23

answered every question in the investigation fully and

24

accurately.

It is true that they named two

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That wasn't accurate, was

it?
MR. SMITH:

Well, that wasn't the question.

The question that we were answering was people who had

10

complained about the particular issue in the charge.

11

And so as Judge Reed concluded, we gave them more

12

information than the EEOC requested.

13

14

That's on page 169

When they later on asked for all the people

15

who had filed charges of discrimination, we gave them

all that information.

That was about eight more people

2

That was all factually not true.
It is true that there were some complaints

which, of course, when you read them are ­­ are quite

serious, but that doesn't mean the company is liable,

5

certainly not liable on a class basis where ­­ for

claims which were never investigated, never conciliated.

7

The whole policy of the statute, of course, is to have a

reasonable investigation, have a reasonable cause

finding, have conciliation.

10

And here that became

meaningless, except with respect to one claimant.

where individual claimants will come in.

4

And so we had a class claim which they said

was a pattern of practice claim.

6

at that point for us to say, well, you ­­ you can't

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that all gets to the

reasonableness or unreasonableness point.

5

this Court need not reach that, I take it, if we ­­ we

address the ­­ the prevailing party argument.

7

can, of course, ask them in a few minutes ­­ in what

And we ­­

And it

10

would the government agree that there is a prevailing

11

party, that the defendant can be a prevailing party?

12

MR. SMITH:

I think they have ­­ they've

13

said the merits issue is not really relevant.

14

have ­­ as I understand it, what they've said certainly

15

is, you know, if it was ­­ they ­­ they would say if

16

it's a disposition with prejudice, whether it's based on

17

a merits issue or some other merits, non­merits issue,

18

like statute of limitations or something else, that

19

appears to be their position.

20

They

And I think the problem with the without

prejudice/with prejudice distinction, which they ­­ they

22

brought out in their merits brief, is that's the first

23

time in this litigation that that argument has ever been

24

made by the EEOC.

25

ever argued that, A, the disposition here was without

not a prevailing party.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Smith, understanding

4

that you think that, but if we could just go on from

5

that, what is wrong with that position?

6

a substitute test, or ­­ or is there no substitute test,

7

in your view?

8

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, as ­­ as to

the first question, the first problem with the argument

And do you have

Right.

Let's just assume

that it were.
MR. SMITH:

Okay.

Leaving aside the waiver

15

and the fact that there's no factual predicate for the

argument here, on the merits, we didn't have an

17

opportunity to brief this issue because it's not in the

18

case until we're writing our reply brief.

19

about a paragraph on the issue.

20

So we have

I think that it's a ­­ there's ­­ there is a

21

circuit conflict on the question whether or not a

22

district judge ought to have the power, in the suitable

23

circumstances when dismissing a case for failure to do

something like pre­suit petitions, where there was a

25

sufficient level of abusiveness by the plaintiff, he

there ought to be the power of a court to exercise its

discretion ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Even if the ­­ even if the

10

MR. SMITH:

Well, it's curable perhaps, but

11

there are going to be situations ­­ and this case is a

12

good illustration ­­ where you can't get rid of the fact

13

that you've spent lots and lots of money litigating

claims which, if they'd been ­­ been investigated and

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not clear to

In ­­ in this case as to,

7

I guess, the 67 women that the Court ­­ before it goes

8

to the court of appeals on round number one, says the

9

Court bars the EEOC from seeking relief.

10

MR. SMITH:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12
13

Yes, sir.
Is that a phrase district

courts use often, "bars"?
MR. SMITH:

You know, I think it was

14

invented by the judge here because she's dealing with a

15

rather peculiar animal, which is a one­count complaint

16

which says Ms. Starke was sexually harassed and it was

17

not appropriately handled, and a class of people were

18

sexually harassed and it was not appropriately handled.

19

And they start bringing these things in, and to the

20

extent that ­­ at that point in the case, they're trying

21

to litigate them as individual claims.

22

And the ­­ so rather than dismiss the ­­ the

23

claims, she said individuals ­­ when they were

24

litigating on their own behalf, she would dismiss the ­­

25

the claim with prejudice, but she would tell the EEOC,

led you to bring them into court ­­

13

And there was ­­ the whole class thing, which

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With respect to those 67,

14

I thought we had held that in Mach Mining, that the

15

remedy for inadequate conciliation, investigation and

16

conciliation, is not dismissal, but return to continue

17

the efforts to conciliate.

18

MR. SMITH:

What you held in Mach Mining,

19

Your Honor, is that where there is a failure of

20

conciliation, the appropriate remedy is a stay so they

21

can conciliate some more.

22

Title VII in 706 which specifically authorizes a judge

23

to stay a case for further conciliation.

24
25

And you cited a provision in

What Judge Reed concluded is that a stay
wouldn't make sense here.

She expressly considered that

2

the claims, and you haven't made any findings about the

3

merits of the claims, and you've put the court and the

4

parties through years of litigation.

5

In that situation, the ­­ the additional

6

sanction of barring you from litigating the case is

7

appropriate, and I think that clearly ought to be within

8

the discretion of the district court ­­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Smith, do you understand

10

her order as ­­ as saying that if the EEOC did engage in

11

conciliation, had made the initial findings, had

12

satisfied all the pre­suit requirements, could the EEOC,

13

do you think, have come back and brought those

14

individual claims?

Because she ­­ she

considered whether to stay the case and let them go do

remedy of dismissing these claims.

claims from ever seeing the inside of a courtroom and

that the judge acknowledged that fact.

again in the second appeal from the Eighth Circuit.

5

They did that

And then, most tellingly, they file a

6

Rule 60 motion after Mach Mining is decided last year in

7

which they asked the district judge to reopen the case,

8

and say, you should have done a stay; you shouldn't have

9

dismissed this.

And the reason you should do that is

10

because we have been prevented for the last six years

11

from litigating these claims.

12

And does Judge Reed then say, no, it was

13

dismissed without prejudice.

14

couldn't litigate these claims.

15

what I did, and I did it for good and sufficient reason

abused the process and didn't follow your obligations,

3

you still haven't satisfied your pre­suit requirements,

so of course I'm not changing anything.

So she might just have said, well,

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, there's ­­

Now that the government has satisfied the pre­suit

I didn't ­­ I didn't dismiss these with prejudice.

13

MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

I think it's

14

quite clear from what she did say last fall, in

December, actually, that ­­ that she knew it was with

16

prejudice, intended it to be with prejudice, and wasn't

20

And I think there's no other

And we ultimately have a judgment that says

Where is that?

There's a

piece of paper called "the judgment" somewhere.

5

And the attached is an

And if you look at the bottom of 118a, the

The ­­ there were ­­ all the other women

22

25

Why isn't this case the case that

MR. SMITH:

Well, it refers to her case; it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

refers to the Tillie Jones case, and to all the other

2

claims asserted by the EEOC under a one­count complaint.

3

There is no separate count for each of these people.

4

And so when you dismiss that count, it expressly says,

5

"With respect to all the other claims asserted by the

6

EEOC," I think it's pretty obvious that the case is

7

dismissed with prejudice with respect to all the claims

8

asserted by the EEOC, including the 67, Your Honor.

9

That was ­­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All the claims that were

11

then being litigated by the EEOC, which did not include

12

the claims that had previously been dismissed for

13

failure to satisfy the pre­suit requirements.

14

MR. SMITH:

It's a basic principle that a

15

judgment at the end of the merits phase goes back and

16

incorporates all the ­­ the prior rulings of the court,

17

and is based on the prior rulings in which ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that's not ­­ it's

19

not right, if the prior ruling was based on a curable

20

dismissal and the EEOC had simply done nothing with

21

respect to that set of claims, neither cured it nor

22

renounced the possibility that they would cure it.

23

In 2013, the court was facing a much reduced

24

set of claims in a different suit.

25

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I think that ­­ that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the judgment is going to go back and cover everything

2

that happened in the case.

3

If there was something left

4

MR. SMITH:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

6

The question on what this Court granted

7

certiorari is not, as Mr. Smith suggested, and has been

8

the basis for his waiver arguments, whether or not the

9

Eighth Circuit was correct to say that a Title VII

10

defendant has to prevail on the merits in order to

11

secure a fee award and to be a prevailing party.

12

Instead, the question that petitioner framed

13

in the petition and the question on what this Court

14

granted certiorari is whether the dismissal of a

15

Title VII case, based on the EEOC's failure to satisfy

16

its pre­suit investigations, can form the basis for an

17

award of attorneys' fees.

If the case is over, the defendant won, he is the

25

prevailing party for purposes of that case.

This ended the litigation.

So, I mean,

Now, maybe they can bring another case
But they won this case.

But why isn't a simple rule the best rule?

defendant prevails on this sort of round because the

MR. FLETCHER:

23

reason to question whether that purpose is served, where

24

the reason why this suit is defeated is a failure to

25

satisfy a procedural precondition.

I think you're right, as Your
I think the purpose of the

I think, first of all, there's some

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not sure it's

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

38
1

fair to say that that's a factually or legally

2

ungrounded suit.

3

to take a step that it was supposed to take before

4

coming to court, but a curable step.

5

It's a suit where the plaintiff failed

I think in those sorts of circumstances to

6

say that those defendants can't recover for whatever

7

fees they secure in resolving that initial procedural

8

question doesn't really get at the core of what the

9

statute was.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there ­­ because ­­

notion that if the sort ­­ if our rule was going to

they're applying this rule; has the plaintiff been

barred from pursuing this claim permanently?

then the defendant is a prevailing party.

22

it's a different ground, if it's a precondition to suit,

if it's the wrong forum, if it's a dismissal without

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Wouldn't it be an

adequate response to your concern if fees were awarded

solely on the ground in which the case was dismissed?

5

That would be ­­ in other words, the judge would have

the discretion to do that.

and says, okay, it's clear you're in the wrong venue,

8

you know, and hours of research would have showed you

that.

If the judge looks at this

So, you know, it's frivolous on that ground, and

10

I'm throwing the case out because the ­­ the defendant

11

prevails on that ground.

12

Now, the defendant may have spent a lot of

13

other money with depositions and everything else.

14

the judge could say, well, you can file the ­­ the case

15

again tomorrow.

16

into the next district.

17

They're going to be equal to the amount of time the

defendant had to spend defending against your frivolous

venue assertion.

20

You probably will.

But

You just have to go

So I a.m. going to award fees.

It doesn't have to do that.

I mean, you

21

know, if you have the wrong venue, and they spend five

22

years doing depositions because you have the wrong

23

venue, they should probably get fees for all of it.

24

if it's just, you know, a small portion, easily disposed

25

of, is that a possible remedy?

Alderson Reporting Company

But

MR. FLETCHER:

Sir, I think that's a better,

2

a more sensible rule.

3

little bit about why I think it may be a little tricky

4

to fit into the doctrine, but just to illustrate its

5

application in this case, for instance, a petitioner got

6

a fee award on the order of 4.6, $4.7 million, as we

7

explain in our brief.

attributable to actually litigating about this ground

here, whether or not we satisfied the preconditions to

The amount of those fees that are

22

MR. FLETCHER:

It's sort of

It's not a venue

Well, I ­­ I'm not sure

that's ­­ that's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

First of all, we ­­ we disagree that we were

24

frivolous in thinking we satisfied our pre­suit

25

obligations.

That's an issue that hasn't been resolved

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

by the Eighth Circuit yet, and we think for some of the

2

reasons that Justice Ginsburg suggested and that Judge

3

Murphy suggested on the merits in the Eighth Circuit.

4

Actually, we very much were not frivolous on thinking we

5

had satisfied these preconditions.

6

But to get to the ­­ the heart of your

7

question, I do think, actually, that it is a very

8

discreet issue.

9

into court, you have to do an investigation.

It's ­­ Title VII says before you come
There has

10

to be a reasonable­cause determination and you have to

11

attempt to conciliate ­­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

Well, it may

13

be a discreet issue, but it's a cause in fact for all

14

the other fees.

15

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I ­­ I'm not sure

16

that's right, in that if Petitioner had raised this

17

early on ­­ and I ­­ I do want to be clear, that from

18

the outset in this litigation, I disagree a little bit

19

with what Mr. Smith said about what the EEOC looked into

20

in its investigation.

21

knew that we had told them in conciliation, we think you

22

have a problem here; we think you're engaged in sexual

23

harassment against a class of women.

24

conciliate that class claim; they declined to do that.

25

But from the outset, everyone

Alderson Reporting Company

We tried to

Wait.

Wait.

I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

suppose whether the issue we're debating may not be

directly pertinent, my question is whether or not that

3

could be a factor that the district courts could look at

4

in deciding the amount of fees and so on.

5

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes, I take that point.

6

If ­­ if you resolved the question against us, you say a

7

defendant could be a prevailing party when it prevails

8

on this sort of ground that doesn't foreclose for

9

litigation, then I absolutely agree with you that it

would be perfectly appropriate and ­­ and indeed, I

this kind of inquiry.

14

But, I ­­ I guess, I think the

So ­­ so as I understand

from proceeding further in this case.

MR. FLETCHER:

Because that sort of

litigation ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Incidentally, is it clear

12

that after this time that there was no time bar if they

13

had come back again?

14

MR. FLETCHER:

That's right.

The EEOC does

15

not have a statute of limitation that's applicable to ­­

16

to suits brought by the commission.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then, your position

18

that no matter how unreasonable the plaintiff has been,

19

no matter how costly it's been, no matter how long it's

20

taken, that you cannot award fees unless the case ­­ and

21

then the case is dismissed, and the judge says you're

22

barred from bringing this claim in this suit, no fees;

23

that's your position.

24
25

MR. FLETCHER:

That's correct.

And I

understand that in some cases ­­ I don't think this is

such a case ­­ but in some cases, that might have

2

unappealing consequences.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, and that's ­­ in a

4

case like that, what if the ­­ the EEOC after that

5

dismissal goes back and looks at these cases and says,

6

you know what, we really have nothing here, and

7

therefore, chooses not to bring the case, you would say

8

that because the ­­ because the first case was dismissed

9

without prejudice, there could be no fees?

10
11

MR. FLETCHER:

I ­­ I would, and I think

that follows ­­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. FLETCHER:

What sense does that make?
I think it follows from

Buckhannon.

15

was you have a plaintiff that brings a suit.

16

hypothesis, let's assume it's a meritorious suit, and

17

there's some litigation and the plaintiff incurs fees,

18

and then at some point the defendant sees the writing on

19

the wall and voluntarily recedes from the conduct and

20

gives the plaintiff exactly what they want.

21

Remember, that ­­ the issue in Buckhannon
By

I think the Court recognized that there is a

22

really strong policy argument for allowing courts to

23

award fees to plaintiffs in that case, because they're

24

doing what Title VII and the Civil Rights Act intended

25

to ­­ to encourage plaintiffs to do.

Alderson Reporting Company

And they're sort

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

of left, you know, out of pocket for all the fees if

2

they're not eligible for fee awards.

3

This Court still said they're not entitled

4

to get fee awards because they haven't secured a court

5

order that materially alters the party's legal

6

relationship.

7

I think the same thing is true of the ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

I guess I just don't see

8

what functional sense that makes.

9

defendant has wasted a huge amount of litigation

If ­­ if the

10

resources and caused the ­­ I'm sorry, the plaintiff

11

has ­­ has caused ­­ imposed a great and unjustified

12

burden on the defendant, I don't ­­ I don't see why, as

13

a functional matter, unless this is foreclosed by a

14

prior decision, there shouldn't be a possibility of fees

15

in that situation.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I do think it's pretty

17

close to foreclosed by Buckhannon.

18

Buckhannon dealt with whether or not a plaintiff is

19

prevailing.

20

was "prevailing party" is a legal term of art.

21

a party that secured a material alteration in the legal

22

relationship of the parties.

23

Obviously,

Our argument is that the Court's rationale
It means

And the court in Buckhannon stuck to that,

24

despite very strong policy arguments, saying that those

25

sorts of plaintiffs ought to get fee awards.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

think it ought to do the same thing here when it's

2

presented with essentially the converse ­­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then what is the argument?

4

I take it your argument now is what's sauce for the

5

goose is sauce for the gander.

6

Buckhannon says that a plaintiff can't

7

recover, even if he litigates to death and they find ­­

8

give up and pay him a billion dollars.

9

a judicially sanctioned change in legal relationship, he

Unless there is

10

can't recover fees.

11

should the defendant recover, unless there is a

12

judicially sanctioned change in relationships and the

13

only candidate for such a thing is a dismissal with

14

prejudice of some form.

And if he can't recover it, why

15

MR. FLETCHER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

So if that's the argument, and that argument

Yes, that's correct.
Okay.

Got the argument.

18

is correct, why don't we have the situation here?

19

Because you heard the judgment being read.

20

"with prejudice."

21

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.

It says

So there's two

22

judgments in this case, the one that's entered after the

23

district court resolves the issue that's before you

24

now ­­ the 67 claims that are before you now is found at

25

pages 216 to 217 of the Petition Appendix.

Alderson Reporting Company

And what the

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

district court says is the EEOC has asked me to stay

2

this to allow it to go conciliate.

3

that.

4

footnote ­­ this is a few pages earlier on, pages 213

5

to 14 ­­ and it cites another case that dismissed a

6

claim under the same circumstances.

7

that the district court cited as precedent for the

8

dismissal was expressly a dismissal without prejudice.

I'm not going to do

I'm going to dismiss instead.

And it drops a

That earlier case

9

The district court then goes on to say ­­

10

and this is language that you've referred to, Justice

11

Kennedy ­­ that the EEOC is barred from further

12

litigation on the claims.

13

further litigation in this case.

14

relief in the trial in this case.

15

But it says barred from
It cannot pursue

And I think most importantly, when the

16

district court says it's dismissing, and then when it

17

ultimately enters a judgment of dismissal, it does not

18

specify that the judgment is with prejudice.

19

And we actually have a Federal Rule of Civil

20

Procedure, Rule 41(b), that is particularly and

21

expressly designed to address this situation to ensure

22

that parties and courts don't have to engage in the kind

23

of inquiry that Mr. Smith was engaged in, in the first

24

half of the argument, of trying to figure out what does

25

the judge mean, what do the parties think that the judge

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

means.

2

This is at ­­ Rule 41(b) is at page 17a at

3

Petition Appendix, and it says, "An involuntary

4

dismissal" ­­ it establishes a default rule.

5

"Ordinarily, if you have an involuntary dismissal by the

6

court, unless the court specifies otherwise, it operates

7

as an adjudication on the merits."

with prejudice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It says,

Ordinarily dismissal

Now, so what you're

10

saying is in ­­ the judge said they cannot precede again

in this case?

13

MR. FLETCHER:

They cannot seek relief on

behalf of these 67 women in this case.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And why ­­ why isn't

15

that prevailing?

16

they may not prevail in another case or ­­ that's your

17

argument?

18
19

Why aren't they prevailing?

MR. FLETCHER:

What ­­

So that ­­ that's my

argument.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because they have

21

engaged in ­­ under your theory, they have engaged in an

22

illegal practice.

case, but they may be sued by somebody else in another

case?

25

But our view is ­­ and ­­ and we think we're

right about this, and we ­­ we think it's supported by

7

Costello ­­ that leaves the EEOC free to satisfy the

8

precondition ­­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MR. FLETCHER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What ­­ ­­

­­ and come back to court.
What do you ­­ yeah,

12

I ­­ what do you think the significance of Mach Mining

13

is on this issue?

14

MR. FLETCHER:

So our view is that Mach

15

Mining suggests that this issue shouldn't come up again

16

in future cases.

17

that the appropriate remedy for a failure of

18

conciliation like the one here is a stay rather than a

19

dismissal.

20

As we read Mach Mining, it suggests

I don't think ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then why isn't

21

that ­­ I mean, if ­­ if the EEOC doesn't do anything at

22

all ­­ I mean, under Mach Mining, if they don't

23

conciliate, the remedy is go conciliate.

24

MR. FLETCHER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Wouldn't ­­

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

51
1

wouldn't you think if the reason they're ­­ didn't ­­ it

2

was frivolous for them to bring the suit without

3

conciliation, you know, if somebody said, Well, we've

4

got to conciliate, and they said, Oh, forget about it,

5

go ahead, why wouldn't fees be a perfectly appropriate

6

sanctions?

7

In other words, there's no ­­ under some

8

sense, there's no incentive for them to conciliate,

9

because if it turns out they didn't, they have to go

10

conciliate.

11

they ignored their duty to conciliate, it seems to me

12

that might give them some incentive to get it right the

13

first time.

But if they were subject to fees because

14

MR. FLETCHER:

So I think I ­­ I'd like to

15

quibble with the premise.

I ­­ I think, as we explain

16

in our brief, the EEOC has a great incentive to

17

conciliate because it gets a massive number of

18

complaints each year or charges each year.

19

reasonable cause to believe that there's been a

20

violation of Title VII in a huge number of cases, and

21

has very limited resources.

22

and actually does, resolve far more cases by

23

conciliation than by litigation; it doesn't rush into

24

court.

25

It finds a

And so it really does, try

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

So you're not likely

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

to be subject to this sanction in many cases, which is a

2

good thing.

3

MR. FLETCHER:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5
6

Right.
But sometimes ­­

okay.
MR. FLETCHER:

But I take your point, that

7

then the question is, so if the EEOC ­­ let's ­­ by

8

hypothesis, should ­­ unreasonably fails to satisfy its

9

conciliation obligation, and the court finds that to be

10

the case, and then it stays, pursuant to Mach Mining,

11

and sends them off to conciliate, could the court award

12

fees, I take it to be the question.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. FLETCHER:

Right.

that, but ­­ but first I think it's ­­ it's helpful to

just sort of tie down the 2009 dismissal originally.

6

And just to wrap up the point, it's that

I do want to talk about

under Rule 41, if you have a dismissal that's for lack

of jurisdiction, that doesn't count as an adjudication
