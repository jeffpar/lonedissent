ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The fundamental problem with the statutes at

12

issue in these three cases is that they make it a

13

criminal offense to assert a constitutional right.

14

Under laws of North Dakota and Minnesota, a person who

15

is stopped on suspicion of impaired driving is obligated

16

to take a warrantless chemical test to determine the

17

alcohol content of their blood.

18

The States concede that these tests are

19

searches under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

20

United States and North Dakota appear to recognize that

21

no exception under the recognized exceptions of the law

22

requirement applies.

23

obligated to take this warrantless ­­ to submit to this

24

warrantless search, and is committing a criminal offense

25

if he or she does not do so.

The

Nevertheless, a person is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it correct to say that

2

you concede that the State could revoke the driver's

3

license for refusing to take the test, either blood,

4

alcohol or Breathalyzer?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

That ­­ that is not at issue

6

in this case.

7

but ­­ but I ­­ but we don't dispute for purposes of

8

this case that the State could do that.

9

We haven't taken a position on that,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let's ­­ let's

10

assume that that is a concession or that we hold that or

11

that that's a premise.

12

administrative sanction, why couldn't it also impose a

13

criminal sanction?

14

you would just be no more than three days in jail,

15

criminal sanction, or a three­year suspension, which is

16

obviously greater.

17

If the State can impose a civil

We could have hypotheticals where

Why should there be a difference?

MR. ROTHFELD:

I ­­ I think the fundamental

18

distinction that ­­ that governs the outcome of this

19

case, we think, is that ­­ is that between the State

20

taking away a benefit that it didn't have to give you in

21

the first place, which is what the Court addresses in

22

the unconstitutional conditions line of cases.

23

In this situation here, where the State is

24

saying by fiat, you are subject to a criminal penalty,

25

affirmative criminal penalty, for ­­ for asserting a

Alderson Reporting Company

constitutional right.

2

In the case that you are hypothesizing ­­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think the

4

conditions are just different.

5

analytically ­­ analytically it's a ­­ it's a different

6

proposition.

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

I ­­ I don't think that

But I ­­ I have to disagree

8

with that, Your Honor, for this reason:

9

that in the unconstitutional conditions line of cases,

I ­­ I think

10

what the Court has said is the State has given someone a

11

benefit that it did not have to give in the first place.

12

And that all the State is doing when it takes that

13

benefit away is saying you're back in the position that

14

you were to begin with.

15

penalty that's attached to what the individual is doing.

16

There is no sort of direct

And the Court in those cases has said, we

17

will look to see the practical effect of the combination

18

of the benefit and the condition to see whether or not

19

the State in ­­ in reality is trying to do indirectly

20

what it could not do directly, that being the ­­ the

21

suppression of the constitutional right.

22

those cases, the Court will look to see is ­­ what is

23

it, agree with the connection between the benefit and

24

the condition?

25

coercion that the ­­ the State's manipulation of the

And so in

And it will look to see the degree of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

benefit and condition imposes on the individual to

2

surrender a constitutional right.

3

But as the Court ­­ the Court has made very

4

clear in this entire line of cases what it's trying to

5

do is figure out, is the State trying to do indirectly

6

something that it could not do directly, which is

7

abdicate a constitutional right?

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

One way ­­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This ­­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

One way of looking at what

11

the State is doing is not to criminalize the assertion

12

of a constitutional right, but to criminalize reneging

13

on a bargain.

14

license to drive, and in exchange for that, you consent

15

to a ­­ to a blood­alcohol test under certain

16

circumstances.

17

that's what's criminalized.

18

of looking at this?

19

And the bargain was, we give you a

And if you renege on that bargain, then

MR. ROTHFELD:

Why isn't that a better way

I ­­ I think it ­­ to look at

20

it that way, I think you're sort of in ­­ in the world

21

of consent.

22

suggestion that consent of that sort was present because

23

in this case, there ­­ there is no reason to believe

24

that the defendants had any idea that they were agreeing

25

to the bargain that ­­ that you ­­ you described.

In this case, at least, there is no

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under Justice

2

Alito's hypothetical, suppose if for every driver's

3

license you had to sign a consent form, I consent to

4

take a Breathalyzer test in the event the officer has

5

grounds to require it.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me answer that

7

question in two parts, Your Honor.

8

going on in this case, where there is nothing like that

9

on ­­ on the form, what's happening here, the way that

So someone who

anything is still subject to the same criminal

penalties.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's my next

4

question, but let's just talk about just the State ­­

5

the State.

6
7

MR. ROTHFELD:

And, Justice Sotomayor, that,

in fact, is the reality of this State.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

I know.

But ­­ but I ­­ I think, as I

10

say, the analysis there would be not the analysis in

11

this case, but a consent analysis under the Schneckloth

12

line of cases.

13

State's obligation to show on the totality of the

14

circumstances that the consent to permit the search and,

15

therefore, to subject yourself to the conditions is ­­

16

is truly voluntary, that it's the product of the

17

defendant's choice, that it was not the product of

18

coercion ­­

19

And I think they're ­­ it would be the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

in North Dakota and sparsely populated States, you have

21

to drive in order to ­­ so we know that consent is ­­ is

voluntary and that it was explained and so forth and

it.

argument that it's ­­ it's coerced.

4

It still seems to me you'd ­­ you'd have an

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that's right.

I

5

think, as I say, the analysis would be a consent

6

analysis under Schneckloth.

7

that is coercion, and I would think that if someone is

8

told, you cannot drive, particularly in a rural State

9

like North Dakota, and probably anywhere, but certainly

10

there, something which is absolutely essential to daily

11

life, to going to your job ­­

One of the key points of

I thought you were just

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, no, no.

I'm ­­ I

21

apologize, Your Honor.

22

What I'm saying is, if ­­ if the submission, as Justice

23

Kennedy hypothesizes, is people are told and actually

24

are aware that they are being told that if they drive

25

they are consenting to be searched, that they're

That's not what I meant to say.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

consenting to submit to the chemical test, I think

2

whether the State can execute on that depends on whether

3

or not there is consent.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no.

But I

5

thought you said, well, of course there's coercion

6

because you can't survive in North Dakota without a car,

7

which I'm happy to postulate, but ­­ but what is ­­ what

8

is the basis for that ­­ that right?

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

I ­­ I think that's not a ­­

10

not a right that's granted in the Constitution.

11

what's ­­ the relevance of that is that there would be

12

coercion, we think, within the meaning of Schneckloth,

13

within the meaning of this Court's Fourth Amendment

14

coercion, you know, voluntary consent.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What ­­

So ­­ so for

16

purposes of analyzing this case, we have to assume that

17

States could prohibit people from driving, period.

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that that's right.
Okay.

as the border goes, now when it's ­­ I understand

MR. ROTHFELD:

But what if there's a

Again, that would ­­ that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

would not be this case, because in this case there is no

2

suggestion that these defendants had any idea that these

3

statutes existed, let alone that they were voluntarily

4

surrendering their right to assert the Fourth Amendment.

5

But in the hypothetical that you suggest, I

6

think it would be a difficult case for the State to

7

make, because the State's obligation would have to be to

carry the burden of showing that the defendant actually

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it true that the

weaker, because in that ­­ they could not then condition

You mean ­­
I suppose the reason

would be that the issue we're talking about, all the

traffic deaths, right?

24

it's not a realistic contention, but that's ­­ a lot of

25

the hypotheticals aren't.

I mean, if ­­ I mean, obviously

I'm trying to get to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

basis of, it seems to me that the flexibility that a

2

State has in this situation depends upon what rights the

3

motorist has.

4

And I understand the Fourth Amendment

5

argument, but it does seem to me that if you're making

6

an unconstitutional­conditions argument, it is pertinent

7

to determine what authority the State has in any event.

8
9

MR. ROTHFELD:
let me be very clear.

That's right.

But let me ­­

I think that there are two points

10

that are crucial.

11

unconstitutional­conditions argument.

12

what the State is doing here is a ­­ is a direct

13

assertion of ­­ direct imposition of criminal penalties

14

on people who assert their Fourth Amendment rights.

15

This is nothing to do with a condition because, as I

16

say, these ­­ these defendants are not shown to have

17

been aware that they were subject to a condition at all.

18

One is that we are not making an

JUSTICE ALITO:

We are saying

But we're interested in ­­

19

in other possibilities.

20

State can condition the ­­ the right to ­­ the ability

21

to drive on the State's roads ­­ and let's assume this

22

is not somebody who is crossing the border.

23

State can condition the ­­ the ability to drive on a

24

State's roads on consenting to a blood­alcohol test,

25

perhaps under certain circumstances.

And so if you assume that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Assume a

Let's say this is

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

done in writing at the time when the person applies for

2

the license, so it's not ­­ it's not just implied.

3

Why does that ­­ what is different about

4

that situation from a number of other situations that I

5

can think of?

6

to operate an interstate passenger train on submitting

7

to a blood­alcohol test in the event of reasonable

8

suspicion.

9

under the influence of ­­ of alcohol, or the same thing

10

For example, conditioning a ­­ a license

11

Or suppose there were a law that said that

13

as this building, the ­­ the condition of entering is

14

consenting to a search, and you have to sign something,

15

you have to go through the magnetometer.

16

person got through that, and there was reasonable

17

suspicion that the person had smuggled in some kind of a

18

weapon, the person would be subjected to a search.

19

would be the difference between that situation and this

20

situation?

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

And then if a

I think there would be a

22

number of ­­ of distinctions.

23

that's in at least some of the hypotheticals that ­­

24

that you offer, the train hypothetical, for example,

25

that's the Skinner case.

One would be, I think

There is a special­needs

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

2

there is no ability, no ­­ on the part of the individual

4

argue.

MR. ROTHFELD:

But I ­­
So it doesn't seem to me

to help us.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

I ­­ again, I ­­ I think I ­­

7

I would look at it differently, Your Honor.

8

that what's happening in a case like Skinner is the

9

Court is addressing the substantive scope of the Fourth

Amendment. It's saying that in the circumstances of this

11

search, is there a requirement for a warrant, because ­­

12

and as ­­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we would say,

14

suppose we said this is like Skinner.

15

Justice asked about statistics, suppose there was a

compelling showing that there was a measurable increase

17

in traffic fatalities.

18

would say this is a special condition, and therefore you

19

must consent.

20

there is no constitutional right because we just said

21

there's no constitutional right.

If the Chief

If this was not in force, we

analysis.

But ­­ but it's an important point, so let me

go back to this.

2

I think what was happening in Skinner is the

Court ­­ and that whole line of cases, Skinner and

23

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think ­­ I think that the

24

analysis there is, I mean, do we look ­­ we look to the

25

basic Fourth Amendment's characteristics that go into

whether a search is required.

2

Court essentially addressed that very question.

3

Court addressed the argument that the nation's impaired

driving problem is so severe, so compelling, that we can

5

disregard the warrant requirement, and the Court

6

rejected that.

7

accepted that as principle in McNeely.

In McNeely, I mean, the
The

And in fact, no member of the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not sure

that was the ­­ I'm not sure that's different in this

10

case.

11

what we're saying is that the need for safe

12

transportation on the trains to protect the innocent

13

people there is ­­ is compelling enough that ­­ that it

14

falls within the special­needs exception.

15

again, I'm not ­­ not sure why that analysis wouldn't

16

apply here.

I mean, in the ­­ in the railroad case, I think

17

I ­­ I don't know.

And I'm ­­

I suspect more people

18

die from drunk driving accidents than from train

19

accidents, and so the special need would seem to be just

20

as ­­ as compelling.

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

But I think that that was not

22

the rationale in Skinner, certainly not the entire

23

rationale.

24

there was no warrant requirement there.

25

said not just that there was no warrant requirement but

I think that the principal reason for saying

Alderson Reporting Company

And the Court

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

20
1

that there was no probable cause requirement; that there

2

could be a search without suspicion at all.

3

suggesting that that's appropriate here.

4

No one is

I think that the reason the Court came to

5

that conclusion, both in Skinner and Von Raab and

6

Vernonia and that entire line of cases, is kind of the

7

whole combination of characteristics that there was no

8

discretion, as I said, on the part of the law

9

enforcement officer to decide who to search, that ­­

10

that there were a variety of things that had sort of

11

nothing to do with the ordinary criminal process.

12

were not criminal investigations at all.

13

These

And the Court has said time and again that

14

in the ordinary law enforcement circumstance where a

15

search is being conducted, that a warrant is required.

16

That is the presumption unless ­­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

The presumption ­­ but

18

there are many ways of analyzing this case, so let me

19

try to get you to focus on one that doesn't have to do

20

with consent or any of these differences that you ­­

21

many of them that you've been discussing.

22

One way to analyze it is you just ask:

Is

23

it ­­ there is no such thing as an exception to the

The question is whether the Fourth

I'd appreciate what your response is

to that line of thought.

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

And I will do that.

I will

8

say to begin, I think that your prefatory statement is

9

quite correct that if a warrant is required here, we

10

win.

11

considerably more leeway in what it can do.

12

If a warrant is not required, then the State has

On the breath test, breath test is a

question that the breath test is a search in the Fourth

Amendment ­­ meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

17

conceded by ­­ by my friends on the other side.

18

Court's presumption has been that when there is a search

19

in a law enforcement proceeding, a warrant is going to

20

be required unless one of the regular exceptions to the

21

warrant requirement applies there.

22

As the

That's
And the

And I think it is conceded by the

23

United States and North Dakota that there is no so ­­ no

such exception here.

25

And so ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why can't we say that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

with respect to a breath test that this is a search

2

incident to arrest?

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that it's not a

4

search incident to arrest for the reasons that were

5

stated by the dissenting opinion in ­­ in the Bernard

6

case by Justices Stras and Page of the Minnesota Supreme

7

Court, which is, the court has made very, very clear

8

consistently from Chimel on through Riley most recently

9

that search incident to arrest turns on the existence of

10

one of two considerations, either the search is

11

necessary to preserve officer safety, or to preserve

12

evidence.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think that this

14

would be based on the notion that it's necessary to

15

preserve evidence, plus the notion which Justice Breyer

16

suggested that this is about as uninvasive as a search

17

can possibly be.

18

together, that it is useful to preserve evidence and

19

that it is a extremely uninvasive search, that we can

20

assimilate it into the search­incident­to­arrest

21

doctrine.

22

And so that given those two things

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me answer both of

23

those points.

24

the evidence that's being tested here is the

25

blood­alcohol level, so alcohol level in the blood.

On ­­ on the preservation of evidence,

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

they're simply using breath as a means of doing that.

2

As to that, breath and blood are identical.

3

the Court ­­ the Court addressed this in McNeely.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so, as

Yes, but there's something

5

very different in the level of invasion, and certainly

6

it's appropriate to look at the invasiveness of a search

7

when deciding whether to do a search incident to arrest.

8

I mean, if that weren't true, we wouldn't have talked

9

about how much you could get off of a cell phone in

10

Riley.

11

do body cavity searches when they do search incidents to

12

arrest.

If that weren't true, we would allow people to

13

So it seems to me that the Court can look at

14

the level of invasion incident to a search when deciding

15

whether a particular search comes within the

16

search­incident­to­arrest doctrine, and that that might

17

be a way of separating out this category of cases from

18

the ones that we were talking about in McNeely.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me say two things

20

about that.

21

in fact a significant intrusion on personal integrity

22

for the reasons the Court suggested in the Skinner case.

23

When one takes one of these Breathalyzer tests, I mean,

24

it is not, Justice Breyer, simply that you're exhaling

25

in the ordinary way and carbon dioxide is dissipated

First, our sense is that a breath test is

Alderson Reporting Company

25
1

into ­­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't say ordinary way.

3

I said you blow hard into a little straw­like thing

4

that's connected with what looks like a cell phone.

5

using the word "significant" or not doesn't help me.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. ROTHFELD:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So

Well ­­
I mean, it is what it is.
It's ­­
And that ­­ that ­­ the

10

question is why it is so intrusive that the Constitution

11

insists on a warrant where that insistence could

12

undermine in many cases the evidence that you are

13

looking for?

14

several factors.

15

to say significant or not significant.

16

the question, not the answer.

17

Now, that's ­­ that's a question of
And it doesn't ­­ just doesn't help me

MR. ROTHFELD:

That seems to me

Well, as to why we think it

18

is ­­ why we think it is significant as a personal

19

matter, when one takes a Breathalyzer test of this kind,

20

a tube is inserted into the person's mouth.

21

exhale continuously for an extensive period of time.

22

Could be as many as 20 or 25 seconds.

23

it is to expel what the Court has characterized in

24

Skinner as deep­lung air.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have to

It's ­­
What does that have to do

with it?

2

eyes turn bloodshot when every time he drank four

3

bottles of whiskey, you could look at the his eyes, and

4

that wouldn't be intrusive at all.

5

looking for doesn't have much to do with the intrusion.

6

It's the way you're looking for it that's the problem.

7

That's the problem.

8

know it for a particular reason.

I mean, after all, if in fact the person's

9

I mean, what you're

It's not that you happen to want to

MR. ROTHFELD:

You're inserting a tube into

10

a person's mouth to get them to expel something from

11

deep within their body so that it can be tested by the

12

government.

13

And my ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

I know we've

14

assumed that it's only evidentiary, but in my

15

experience, police, when they do the road test, do it

16

because they want to confirm that you are in fact drunk.

17

Before they take you in and take you off the road,

18

they're doing this test as part of the probable cause

19

evaluation:

way.

But ­­
MR. ROTHFELD:

And that is true with a

cause.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But these ­­
I'm meaning why can't we

14

view it as just part of the necessity of the ­­ of the

15

stop and suspicion of the stop?

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

Because I think again the ­­

17

the tests we're talking about here, the ­­ under the

18

laws of both North Dakota and Minnesota, the officer has

the right to give ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

The right.

So what is the

percent of tests of Breathalyzers that is given at ­­ by

arrested and moved to jail or the equivalent?

And under what ­­ and what percent of

Alderson Reporting Company

they're field sobriety tests.

2

practically every case as an initial screen.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think that's given in

I'm saying what percent is

that might be relevant.

Okay?

7

I'm asking because I'm curious and think
You may not know.

MR. ROTHFELD:

So if you

I don't know, Your Honor.

I

8

think that the answer to that question, how many people

9

who are stopped in a preliminary way are then arrested

10

for suspicion of driving while impaired, and I'm not

11

sure that there are statistics that anyone has that are

12

available.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the Breathalyzer

14

test was improved, there's better technology.

15

suppose that all that's required is to put the

16

Breathalyzer a couple of inch ­­ an inch from the

17

person's mouth and wait for the person to breathe, and

18

that would be sufficient to measure blood alcohol.

That ­­ would you say that's a search?

situation.

23

So let's

I think that might not be a

is the big ­­ what is the big difference between those?

That you have to put a straw in your mouth?

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I would think, Your

3

Honor, that most people ­­ maybe this is just me, but my

4

suspicion would be that if presented with the

5

possibility of either inserting something into your

6

mouth and expelling something from deep within your body

7

to be tested by the government, people will find that

8

more intrusive than having an officer look in their

two points on that.

tests and blood tests identically.

started with that, because I really don't know the

answer.

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's why I

And ­­ and I think the

answer, Your Honor, is that people understand the breath

test to be ­­ it's designed to obtain the same evidence,

23

literally ­­ exactly the same evidence as the blood

test.

25

question ­­

And why, in response to Justice Alito's

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's, I guess ­­

please, go ahead.

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

But I ­­ I think that you

4

were concerned about the dissipation of this evidence.

5

I think as to the blood and the breath test, it's ­­

6

it's exactly the same.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, you're right that it's

8

designed to get at the same evidence, and you're right

9

that the dissipation of the evidence works in exactly

10

the same way.

11

close our eyes to the fact that there's a very

12

significant difference in the degree of invasiveness.

13

You know, even assuming that both of these are searches,

14

which I have to say, you know, I think that that's ­­

15

we've ­­ we've held that, and so blowing is a search,

16

there's no question about that, but there are searches,

17

and then, again, there are searches.

18

invasive searches and less invasive searches.

19

guess my intuitions are that that's an important

20

difference when we think about these questions.

21

But you're suggesting that we should

MR. ROTHFELD:

There are more
And I

Well, as to the nature of the

22

breath test.

23

and ­­ and I'm not sure how much more there is to say

24

about it, but I ­­ but I think that the reality is when

And, again, I've been addressing this

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

they are asked to expel something from deep within their

2

body to be tested by the government, that sort of, on

3

the face of it, is an intrusive proposition, something

4

that most people regard as ­­ as the Court suggested in

5

Skinner ­­ a significant invasion of their personal

6

integrity.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the standard

10

I take it you're not challenging a

That's ­­ that's right.

I ­­

11

I think that would not certainly ­­ certainly would not

12

be a search.

13

­­ I think that that's correct.

14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So I think

Even though it's

involuntarily, the person doesn't want to do it?

16
17

I doubt it would be a seizure.

MR. ROTHFELD:

If it's not a search, we're

not concerned with Fourth Amendment limitations.

MR. ROTHFELD:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

I guess, for some ­­

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
No.

Go ahead.

Just to return to Justice

14

Kagan's point, I think in addition to the particular

15

characteristics of the breath test, which we do think

16

are personally intrusive, I think it is the fact that

17

the Court has always, whenever it has confronted a

18

search ­­ and there is no question that these are

19

searches ­­ in an ordinary law enforcement

20

investigation, not in the special needs kind of, sort of

21

general investigation, the Court has said there must be

22

a warrant unless one of the recognized exceptions apply.

23

And the recognized exceptions, I think, are

24

substantially conceded by the other side, do not apply

25

here.

So it would be, I think, a novelty.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

34
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well ­­ but I guess the

2

question that I asked ­­ I mean, I agree with you that

3

you do need a recognized exception, and that we should

4

not feel good about making up new exceptions

5

willy­nilly.

6

The question is, why isn't this a search

7

incident to arrest given the various aspects that I've

8

mentioned, the fact that the evidence does dissipate

9

over time, that getting a warrant might interfere with

10
11
12

that, and that it's ­­ relatively uninvasive.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Right.

If I may answer that

question, Your Honor, and then sit down?

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Sure.

I think ­­ for dissipation

15

for search­incident­to­arrest purposes, my understanding

16

of ­­ of that doctrine is, one is concerned with ­­ with

17

the suspect doing something affirmatively to get rid of

18

the evidence, flushing the evidence down the toilet.

19

That is the classic search­incident­to­arrest situation.

20

The Court in McNeely made very clear that we're not

21

dealing with that here.

22

test doesn't have to dissipate at a predictable level.

23

It's going to remain in the body to be tested later on.

24
25

The alcohol, breath test, blood

And so I don't think that justifies a search
incident ­­ shoehorning into the

search­incident­to­arrest doctrine.

2

from an entirely different category of threats to

3

evidence, as I understand it.

4

And if I may ­­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's simply graded

Why isn't ­­ why isn't it

6

an affirmative effort to get rid of the evidence because

7

you know the longer the interval passes, the less likely

8

that the test is going to reveal a level that's over the

9

standard amount.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

MR. McCARTHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The North Dakota statute strikes a bargain

4

with individuals who wish to use the State's public

5

roads.

6

Conditioning their use thereon, on consent

7

to a blood­alcohol test, if arrested for drunk driving,

8

the Court has held that this is a valid bargain, and

9

that States may enforce it with the imposition of

10

significant consequences, including license revocation

11

and the use of test refusal as evidence in criminal

12

proceedings.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about another

14

bargain, if people find that texting while driving is

15

becoming an increasing problem, and so when you get a

16

license, you're ­­ you give implied consent for the

17

officer to look at the texts or whatever they can look

18

at on your cell phone to make sure, you know, a minute

19

ago you were texting somebody while driving?

20

would that be acceptable under your rationale?

21

MR. McCARTHY:

I ­­ I think it's highly

22

doubtful, Your Honor.

23

between that and what's going on here.

24
25

Is ­­

I think there's many differences

First of all, the interest here is ­­ is a
uniquely compelling interest?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I assume.

2

don't know what the statistics are going to say.

3

wouldn't surprise me if there are at least as many

4

accidents caused by people texting while driving as

5

drinking while driving.

6

MR. McCARTHY:

I

It

Even still, Your Honor, I

think this statute, it's ­­ given the history, given the

history here, it's a uniquely compelling interest.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

What do you mean

"the history"?
MR. McCARTHY:

The history of the State's

battle in combatting drunk driving.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there's not

15

that much history for texting, because there haven't

16

been iPhones around.

17

MR. McCARTHY:

18

Nonetheless, there's ­­ in these cases,

Certainly, Your Honor.

So there is probable cause to

Well ­­

It's one level over, and it's

Not only that, but what's happening here is

the States are really in a terrible bind.

it is a very powerful alternative.

That's what we said

So it's not that you don't have an out.

The

10

issue for us is:

requirement in our law, that before you search ­­

just the essence of the question on the table here.

has endorsed significant consequences being used as an

enforcement mechanism.

And that is really

So ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you say something

about what the practical consequences of requiring a

16

larger jurisdictions where there's a little bit of a

magistrate in those systems, my understanding is it

takes about a half an hour to hour.

we're ­­ people are asking you is to try to get some

2

to assume something.

3

So let me ask you

Assume that you actually could put into

practice a system which got you a warrant in 10 or 15

5

minutes, which many States of a similar kind have done.

6

What then would be your interest in the ­­ in ­­ in the

7

rule that you're asking us for?

8
9

MR. McCARTHY:

The ­­ the interest would be

almost the same, really, because ­­ and this is the

10

important part here ­­ is that the warrant ­­ the ­­ the

11

purpose of the warrant is to authorize a search over the

12

objection of the arrestee.

13

here.

14

But that's not happening

The ­­ the State does not want to undertake

15

those searches because it's a public safety risk, not

16

only to the officer and to the arrestee, but the medical

17

personnel would be in between them.

18

something the Court acknowledged as legitimate ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And this is

If you ­­

If ­­
If you obstruct justice

22

by refusing to comply with the warrant, you can punish

23

someone for the obstructing justice, and you can get the

24

same outcome as putting them in jail for being drunk and

25

driving.

So what is it that justifies doing away with

Alderson Reporting Company

something as important as the Fourth Amendment warrant

requirement?

MR. McCARTHY:

here is that the warrant ­­ all ­­ is ­­ the point of

the warrant is to authorize the search over the

Do you ­­ does the Constitution require

MS. KEENA:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And ­­
The Constitution leans in

15

that direction.

16

you've told me all the things that cut against you.

17

say, well, before we give the breath test we take them

18

to the station, and so then that seems to take 15

19

minutes, and ­­ and in the meantime why can't you just

20

call the magistrate, and at least we have some kind of

21

safeguard against total arbitrary behavior.

And so I ask you, why not?

23

MS. KEENA:

Well ­­
Is there ­­ and so why is

that bad for the State?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

55
1

MS. KEENA:

Well ­­ and I have to look at

2

our implied­consent statute and what that allows and

3

doesn't allow.

4

implied­consent statute says once I offer a test and

5

they refuse, we're done.

6

So currently, Minnesota's

We're done.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So ­­

But you ­­ I don't ­­ I

7

don't know how to explain it more clearly than that.

8

I'm not talking law.

9

you're prepared to come back and say to me, you know, if

I'm talking practical facts.

If

10

we have to get a warrant, 50 percent of the drunk

11

drivers are never going to be caught, ah, I'll listen to

12

that.

13

If you come back to me and say, you know, if

14

you say that a warrant is required, it will mean that

15

400 policemen have to spend ten seconds more than they'd

16

otherwise spend on a telephone, I say well, that's a

17

point, but not that much of a point.

18

Now, do you see?

19

MS. KEENA:

20

I'm trying to get a fact.

Well ­­ and I don't have those

type of statistics to answer that question.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask a different ­­

22

maybe a different way of asking a similar kind of

23

question.

24
25

When we decided McNeely, there were two
opinions.

But even the opinion that was, you know, the

6

even that said ­­ and this was with respect to a blood

8

there's 20 minutes between the time that you're stopped

9

and the time that we can get you to a hospital to get a

But the Chief Justice's opinion said, look, if

10

blood draw, and you can get a warrant in that 20

11

minutes, then yes, you have to go get a warrant in that

12

20 minutes.

13

So at the very least, why wouldn't that be

14

the case?

things ­­ I mean, I have to say when I originally

you get a ­­ at least what the Chief Justice said in

that time, you have to get a warrant within that time.

2

differently than breath tests.

3

our court has recognized that.

Minnesota specifically treats blood tests

We specifically do.

And

So, for example, under the implied­consent

law in Minnesota, if you are ­­ in order to get a blood

so we do treat it differently.

Minnesota treated it differently in the Bernard case;

that's very clear.

just about the breath test.

out is the enhanceability.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

I'd like to do three things this morning.

13

First, address the real­world consequences.

14

explain why I think a bright­line criminal rule is at

odds with common sense, the U.S. code and this Court's

18

In the real world, I think it's critically

19

important that this Court not assume that warrants are

20

available 24/7.

21

The Court knows that from the NHTSA studies that are in

22

the record.

23

What the ­­ what the study did there was compare three

24

jurisdictions that were able to put in a warrant

25

requirement against the nine jurisdictions that, for

The North Carolina example is ­­ is one.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

various resource reasons, availability of judges reasons

2

and other reasons, were unable to do it.

3

The experience of the park police, I can

4

tell you in the wake of McNeely, is that while they can

5

get the warrants 24/7 in Maryland, they have stopped

6

doing blood draws, except in extraordinary cases in

7

Virginia and D.C. because the magistrates are not

8

available 24/7.

9
10
11
12
13

Even in McNeely itself, where the Court
listed in a long, long footnote ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why ­­

why in Maryland have they been able to and Virginia not?
MR. GERSHENGORN:

In the Federal ­­ for the

14

Federal system, it's not a resource constraint.

15

it, as the Court recognized in McNeely, is a willingness

16

of the judges to be available 24/7.

17

priority is in Federal court.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

every year, aren't there?

6

7

But there are more and more
I mean, we're now up to over

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So Your Honor, there are

8

definitely more and more every year.

9

think that if the Court is doing a rule based on the

But, again, I

10

idea that these warrants are constant ­­ are always

11

available, there is a serious risk that in ­­ once you

12

require that, then the evidence is lost, particularly in

13

a breath test in the jurisdiction where you can't get a

14

warrant.

15

So if I could then turn to the ­­ to the

16

bright­line criminal rule that I understand to be the

17

core of Petitioner's case, in McNeely, this Court said

18

that a State may condition driving on public roads and

19

may require as a condition that a motorist arrested or

20

detained for drunk driving agree to a BAC testing and

21

that the State may impose significant consequences on

22

the subsequent refusal.

23

So the question is:

Does the Constitution

24

impose a bright­line rule against criminal penalties,

25

even when lesser sanctions are insufficient to overcome

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

64
1

the natural incentive that many drivers will have not to

2

abide by that condition?

3

As a matter of common sense, I think that

4

doesn't make sense.

5

a government benefit has major problems.

6

if the condition would extend beyond the term of the

7

benefit, canceling the benefit does nothing.

8

And the U.S. Code reflects that.

9

could, Your Honor, I am subject under 18 U.S.C. 207 to a

10

one­year ban when I leave the Solicitor General's Office

11

for contacting or communicating with the SG's office on

12

an official matter.

13

14

as a condition on my employment.

The idea that you can only withdraw

If I

That is punishable under 18 U.S.C.
That is a criminal penalty

15

That is not the only situation.

16

17

42 U.S.C. 14135 criminalizes a probationer's refusal to

18

give DNA.

19

18 U.S.C.

The idea that there is a bright­line between

20

administrative sanctions and criminal sanctions that

21

forces the government only to rely on withdrawal of the

22

benefit is just not the case.

23

Court's case law.

24
25

That's reflected in this

Back in 1927, in the Stephenson case, which
is discussed in the briefs, that was a situation in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

65
1

which Texas had conditioned driving on the Texas roads

2

and as a ­­ and restricted that by ­­ by imposing all

3

sorts of permitting requirements.

5

interferences with private contracts.

6

other side identifies Stephenson as a case that did not

7

have criminal penalties and that was just a withdrawal

8

of the benefit, I think if the Court looks, we read that

9

case differently.

Now, in that era, the

And although the

And I think if the Court looks at

10

page 260 of Stephenson, it will say that the ­­ see that

11

the Texas statute imposed criminal penalties.

12

And so again, the idea that the only thing

13

the government can do to ­­ is withdraw a benefit in the

14

context of an unconstitutional condition and can't go to

15

the ­­ to the core of it, which is to enforce the

16

prohibition, really makes ­­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think one of our

18

concerns is that driving is so essential for so many

19

people that it's really different than opting to work

20

for the Solicitor General's Office.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. GERSHENGORN:

23

point, but I think this is the critical.

24

said in McNeely, the Court crossed that bridge in

25

McNeely, and in Breithaupt and in Mackey and in Neville.

So Your Honor, I take that

Alderson Reporting Company

What the Court

66

Excuse me, Your Honor.

2

What the Court has said is for 60 years,

3

yes, of course, it's different than working in the

5

activity where you're driving two tons of steel down the

6

road, and the Court said you can condition driving.

7

That is a reasonable condition that the State can

8

impose.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it's a dangerous

This is a helpful answer,

10

and your ­­ your time is running, but I'm going to stop

11

you just to ask another question.

12

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it permissible, based

14

on the pleadings and the briefs that are filed with us,

15

for ­­ for the Court to make a distinction between

16

taking a breath test, refusing to take the breath test

17

and refusing to take a blood test?

18

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Certainly, it is, Your

19

Honor, and we set forth that in our brief.

20

what this Court said in Skinner, and Your Honor's

21

opinion in Skinner, is ­­ the Court has never held the

22

way it did in McNeely that a warrant is required and it

23

should not do so here.

24

Skinner, that there are no significant privacy

25

interests, that we cannot include a breath test to

I do think

The Court said in McNeely ­­ in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

67

implement for privacy concerns.

2

because the intrusion is much smaller, the amount of

3

information that is revealed is just the alcohol.

4

a much narrower set, and it can be done as part of the

5

regular booking process.

6
7

That makes good sense

It's

So on that side of the scale, the privacy
interests are substantially smaller.

Honor's opinion ­­ on Your Honor's question, that the
