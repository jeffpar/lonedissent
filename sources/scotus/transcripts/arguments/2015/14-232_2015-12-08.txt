(10:08 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 14­232, Harris v. The Arizona

5

Independent Redistricting Commission.

6

Mr. Hearne.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK F. HEARNE, II

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9
10
11

MR. HEARNE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The one­person, one­vote principle of the

12

Equal Protection Clause requires an apportionment

13

authority to make a good­faith effort to equally

14

apportion the population as ­­ as practically as

15

possible, and while deviations are tolerated, they are

16

only minor deviations made for legitimate purposes of a

17

rational State policy intended not to be discriminatory

18

or arbitrary.

19

Here, the Arizona Redistricting Commission

20

malapportioned Arizona State legislature by almost

21

10 percent, 8.8 percent, and the district court below

22

found it did so for two reasons.

23
24
25

The first reason was to obtain a partisan
advantage for the Democrat party.
The second reason was a perceived belief

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

that malapportioned districts were necessary to obtain

2

Justice Department preclearance approval.

3

Neither of these reasons justifies a

4

deviation from the constitutional principle of one

5

person, one vote.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Hearne ­­
The second part, do ­­ do

8

you want us ­­ do you want us to overturn the factual

9

finding that compliance with the Voting Rights Act,

10

the ­­ the preclearance procedures, was the reason ­­

11

real reason for the deviation?

12

overturn that as a factual finding?

13

MR. HEARNE:

Do you want us to

No, I don't, as a factual

14

finding.

15

preclearance obtaining Voting Rights Act compliance, we

16

have said, as we've noted in the briefing, it was not

17

necessary to under­populate districts to obtain

18

compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

19

But when you say, Justice Kennedy, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you a ­­ a

20

question?

21

charge that there was an impermissible effort to

22

increase the Democratic authority, power, in the

23

legislature, but the end result was that the Arizona

24

plan gave Republicans more than their proportionate

25

share of seats in the State legislature.

It's ­­ it's odd that you're making this

Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official

6
1

the numbers are, in total, Republicans won 56.6 percent

2

of the State Senate seats, 60 percent of the State House

3

seats.

4

Statewide registration share of 54.4 percent.

And that exceeded the Republican party's

5
6

So if there was an attempt to stack this in
favor of Democrats, it certainly failed.

7

MR. HEARNE:

Well, we would say, Your Honor,

8

that a ­­ an incompetent gerrymander is no less a

9

gerrymander when it unequally apportions the population

10

than a competent gerrymander that obtained the partisan

11

objective.

12

I think the objective that we are trying to

13

achieve here is the one­person, one­vote standard.

14

that's why, whatever the ultimate political outcome, I

15

don't think that vindicates the fact that these are

16

unequally apportioned.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

It ­­ it ­­ it's still not

18

clear to me what ­­ what you want us to say about the ­­

19

the Commission's rationale for compliance and Voting

20

Rights Act compliance that was wrong as a matter of law,

21

because if you don't overturn the factual finding that

22

they had a ­­ a good­faith belief that what they were

23

doing is correct, then ­­ then you have ­­ then you have

24

a problem, it seems to me.

25

Or do you have a problem?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

MR. HEARNE:

I don't believe I do, because I

2

think it's not ­­ the good­faith ­­ what the district

3

court found was that their advisor told them, you can

4

depopulate districts up to 10 percent, and in fact, you

5

should do that because you need to create these

6

under­populated minority districts to obtain

7

preclearance.

8
9

That is wrong.

The Voting Rights Act does

not command, does not compel or require, under­populated

10

districts to obtain preclearance.

11

Generals noted that as well in their briefing and the

12

Justice Department guidelines.

13

The Solicitor

And that's ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I ­­ how

14

confident are you of that?

15

preclearance process at the Department of Justice is

16

famously opaque, and usually the States and

17

municipalities have to go through, or had to go through,

18

several layers of back and forth, here's a proposal ­­

19

it's sort of a bargaining process.

20

confident you can be that ­­ that it wasn't necessary.

21

MR. HEARNE:

I mean, the ­­ the

I don't know how

We certainly agree that the

22

preclearance process was very opaque, as you said,

23

Mr. Chief Justice.

24

chicken entrails, because no one really knows what you

25

do or don't need to do to ­­ to obtain preclearance.

I mean, we said it was like reading

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

But just fundamentally, the Voting Rights

2

Act, even prior to Shelby County, could not compel a

3

redistricting authority to under­populate districts.

4

the advice they had been given, you must under­populate

5

these ten districts in order to obtain preclearance was

6

flawed as a matter of legal advice that doesn't justify

7

malapportionment.

8
9

So

So they could have achieved as, in fact,
their own expert, Dr. King, said.

In the first map ­­

10

they had two maps.

11

map.

12

and their own expert said this map satisfies the Voting

13

Rights Act.

The draft map had a 4 percent, roughly, deviation,

14
15

They had a draft map and a final

Then they went and depopulated further to
get an 8.8 percent deviation.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So they were mistaken.

I

17

mean, you're ­­ you say they ­­ they could have done it

18

without ­­ without disproportioning, but they ­­ they

19

thought that that was okay.

20

doing this in order to comply with the Justice

21

Department.

22
23
24
25

What's the test?

They thought that they were

Is the test what they

intended, or is it an objective test?
MR. HEARNE:
at, actually, both.

Well, I think you have to look

I think you look at the objective

test is:

depopulate districts?

3

Does the Voting Rights Act require you to
That's bad ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So let's assume the answer

to that is no.

5

MR. HEARNE:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
But the people who ­­ who

7

made this apportionment were mistaken, and they thought

8

that it allowed, and indeed may require, you to do that.

9

So?

10

it?

11

That doesn't show a bad motive on their part, does

MR. HEARNE:

No, but I don't think this

12

Court's ever held that bad legal advice justifies a

13

constitutional violation, which in this case that's what

14

they're saying is the ­­

15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

different from an impermissible motive.

17

MR. HEARNE:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19
20

Well, bad legal advice is

Justice Scalia is asking

what ­­ what ­­ what the test ­­ what is the test here?
MR. HEARNE:

Well, I would say this case, as

21

the district court noted, and all three judges split on

22

what the burden of proof was, is a mixed­motive case

23

where you have one assumed illegitimate motive, partisan

24

advantage, and you have another motive which is, oh,

25

it's okay because we needed to do this because our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

advisor said that was necessary for preclearance.

2

Then I think it ­­ the task falls to the

3

Commission to justify, under this Court's decisions in

4

Mt. Healthy and Arlington Heights standard of a

5

mixed­motive case to justify, oh, this was necessary in

6

fact to comply with that.

7

And that was not done.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

than mixed motive.

And ­­ and it was more

It was a finding of dominance, that

10

the dominant purpose of this was to attempt to meet

11

Section 5.

12

MR. HEARNE:

Two of the judges, Judge

13

Clifton and Judge Silver, did find that that was a

14

predominant motive or primary motive.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's a ­­ that's a

16

fact­finding which you ­­ you have a burden if you're

17

seeking to overturn it.

18

MR. HEARNE:

But they also found that there

19

was another illegitimate motive that they assumed ­­

20

Judge Silver didn't necessarily agree, but she assumed,

21

for purposes of decision, that this partisan advantage

22

was a illegitimate motive.

23

So you have a case where this body is

24

unconstitutionally departing from one­person, one­vote.

25

They come forward with two explanations, one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

illegitimate, one supposedly legitimate:

2

preclearance based on erroneous legal advice.

3

the basis of that, the court split on what the burden of

4

proof was.

This
And on

We would ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just to pin this down a ­­ a

6

little bit, Mr. Hearne:

7

the factual finding that the predominant motive was to

8

comply with the Voting Rights Act; is that right?

9

MR. HEARNE:

You ­­ you are not contesting

We ­­ we take the ­­ the

10

factual findings from the district court.

11

protest those.

12

applied the wrong burden­shifting standard in that, in

13

their analysis of those facts.

14

We don't

But what we do believe is that the court

When they have a mixed motive, the proper

15

response would have been to say, okay, you've shown, we

16

found one illegitimate motive.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you keep on saying

18

mixed motive, and I guess people keep on coming back to

19

you and just trying to figure out whether you are, in

20

fact, or are not, in fact, contesting that ­­ that the

21

predominant motive was the Voting Rights Act.

22

MR. HEARNE:

The ­­ when ­­ when we say the

23

Voting Rights Act ­­ again, I want to make my position

24

clear ­­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Was the attempt to comply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

with the Voting Rights Act?

2

MR. HEARNE:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.
And this ­­ and the ­­ and

4

the court found, and it is a factual finding, that

5

that's the predominant motive?

6
7

And I don't mean to harangue you on this.
just want to understand what your argument is.

8
9

MR. HEARNE:

No.

We ­­ we ­­ we ­­ to be

very clear, yes, we accept the factual finding of the

10

two judges, that that was ­­ what they said was the

11

primary motive.

12

the burden in a mixed­motive case, under Arlington

13

Heights, I think footnote 21, or Mt. Healthy, kind of

14

standard.

15

I

But they erred when they did not shift

Secondly, they erred when they gave a

16

justification and found it legitimate when there really

17

was not a legal need to do what they did.

18

no ­­ the Voting Rights Act can't compel vote dilution.

19

And that justification, even if it was had in good

20

faith, does not excuse a constitutional violation of

21

one­person, one­vote.

22

There was

So at minimum, it would need to be remanded

23

for an opportunity for them to somehow ­­ the

24

Commission ­­ explain why they can justify these

25

population deviations.

And that's ­­ that is our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1
2

position, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You ­­ I'm ­­ I'm even

3

further confused.

4

any racial or ­­ or political gerrymandering case.

5

is just a voter­dilution case.

6
7
8

I ­­ I understand that you gave up

MR. HEARNE:

This

That's absolutely correct,

Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, I understand

9

there's one case you're relying on that was summarily

10

affirmed, but is there any other case from this Court

11

that has ever said that a ­­ a deviation of this amount

12

is significant?

13
14
15

I think we've always called it anything
below 9 percent de minimis, correct?
MR. HEARNE:

What the Court has said, as I

16

read the jurisprudence, is that a deviation of over

17

10 percent is prima facie constitutional, and the

18

statements justify it.

19

If it's a deviation of less than 10 percent,

20

the obligation is on the party challenging it to come

21

forward and present some evidence showing that it is

22

done for an arbitrary or discriminatory purpose.

23

That's what we understand that standard to

24

be out of Brown v. Thomson.

25

plurality opinion.

And again, that was a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

But under that standard ­­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ I don't actually

3

understand.

4

required an explanation under 10 percent.

5

I don't know of any case where we've

MR. HEARNE:

Well, I think two ­­ I have two

6

responses to that, Justice Sotomayor.

7

Larios, certainly this Court had a summary affirmance,

8

and the concurring opinion in that case by Justice

9

Stevens and Breyer does say that there is not this magic

10

bright line, and then other decisions of this Court have

11

always disavowed creating some simple bright­line test

12

where deviations from the constitutional standard below

13

that are tolerated.

14

First in Cox v.

So, for example in Karcher, that decision

15

said we specifically don't want to set some line,

16

because the minute we do that, legislators or

17

redistricting authorities will immediately use that as

18

the new standard.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in fact, they

20

have.

21

discouraged them from doing that.

22
23

They've pretty much used 10 percent.

MR. HEARNE:

We've not

It is certainly ­­ it certainly

appeared in some of the district court decisions ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. HEARNE:

I ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

burden shift ­­

3

And again, we see that as the

JUSTICE BREYER:

What it says, actually, in

4

Brown v. Thomson, it says our decisions have

5

established, as a general matter, that an apportionate

6

plan with a maximum population deviation under

7

10 percent falls within this category of minor

8

deviations.

9

deviations from mathematical equality among State

And what we held previously was that minor

10

legislatures are insufficient to make out a prima facie

11

case of invidious discrimination.

12

All right.

So that's the holding of the

13

Court.

14

minor deviations where you have to make out ­­ you have

15

to do something more than you would have to do if it

16

were a ­­ larger than 10 percent.

And this seems to be within the category of

17

MR. HEARNE:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19
20

Right.
Now, what do you think you

have to do?
MR. HEARNE:

Well, I think we have to do,

21

Justice Breyer, what we did, which is to come to the

22

court ­­ to come to a district court and to present to

23

them evidence which the district court found of you have

24

a deviation that, though minor, is done for an

25

illegitimate purpose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

And yes, there was this other pretext of the

2

preclearance issue.

3

requiring judicial scrutiny of that redistricting, and

4

so we have satisfied that burden.

5

That satisfied the burden of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why bother having a

6

minor?

7

to be challenged as voter dilution?

8

MR. HEARNE:

9
10

Don't you think this will lead every single plan

purpose behind the deviation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You didn't show that.

What kind of evidence did you present to the
district court?

15

MR. HEARNE:

Well, I think in this case,

16

this ­­ this case is a very unique case because, as

17

Judge Wake found in his dissent, the chart shows

18

statistically that there was systematic, partisan

19

malapportionment done for that partisan reason.

20

looking at the numbers ­­

21
22

You

didn't just establish it by the fact of the deviation.

13
14

I think that you

would have to still have a showing of an illegitimate

12

Well, no.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just

Looking at the chart at

112a of the appendix?

23

MR. HEARNE:

Yes.

Justice Scalia, that you would be ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I ­­ I thought ­­ I ­­ I

8

thought, Mr. Hearne, that you were saying that the ­­

9

that the thing that you had presented had to do with an

10

impermissible motive, and the impermissible motive was

11

that they didn't have to do all this for Voting Rights

12

Act compliance; is that right?

13

MR. HEARNE:

I'd say there's two ­­ the ­­

14

the first impermissible motive or illegitimate

15

justification is partisanship, to gain an advantage ­­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But that's the very

17

thing that you said, you weren't challenging the factual

18

finding, that that was a subsidiary part of the

19

redistricting.

20

MR. HEARNE:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That was ­­
The dominant part was the

22

voting rights compliance, and I take it you want to

23

undermine the voting rights compliance rationale.

24
25

But then I'm stuck on the same question that
Justice Scalia is stuck on, is what evidence did you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

present that ­­ that there was an impermissible motive

2

with respect to that, as opposed to different views as

3

to what the Voting Rights Act compelled.

4
5

MR. HEARNE:

Two quick answers to that,

Justice Kagan.

6

First is, legally the justice ­­ the Voting

7

Rights Act couldn't compel them to do what they did, so

8

that justification legally is invalid.

9

Secondly, we bring up that point about the

10

burden shift with Arlington Heights and Mt. Healthy,

11

where when we show an illegitimate motive partisanship,

12

then the burden ­­ task falls to the Commission to

13

justify that.

And I would reserve the balance of my time.

Fortunately or unfortunately, in this case

Justice Kennedy's questions.

25

that the Independent Redistricting Commission did indeed

The State does not dispute

2

that these deviations were not random, or that they were

3

not incidental.

4

All sides agree

We also know, and the record shows and no

5

one disagrees, that this pattern to under­populate

6

minority districts was done to help create or further

7

ability to elect districts.

8

direct evidence is they did it intentionally.

9

And we also know that the

So why are we here today?

In the background

10

versus Reynolds v. Sims, this Court has always held that

11

equal protection is not a criteria ­­ another factor

12

when it comes to redistricting, but it is essentially

13

the background in which all redistricting ledges take

14

place.

15

The State of Arizona and the Secretary do

16

not dispute the compliance with the Voting Rights Act

17

was a legitimate or is a legitimate State interest.

18

we don't dispute that maybe there was an ­­ a good

19

motive on the part of drawing these districts.

20

problem is those motives don't matter when what you have

21

is an undermining of the fundamental principle of

22

one­person, one­vote.

The

23

So in this case, what we have is a violation

24

of the Equal Protection Clause, because by intentionally

25

and systemically under­populating those minority

Alderson Reporting Company

20
1

ability­to­elect districts, the IRC violated Equal

2

Protection Clause in that principle of one­person,

3

one­vote.

4

So essentially what happened was by

5

overpopulating the other districts, the voters in the

6

overpopulated districts had their votes diluted.

7

by ­­ by diluting those votes, it violated the

8

Constitution.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

It sounds fundamental that

10

a statute can't authorize a constitutional violation, so

11

that even an attempt to comply with the Voting Rights

12

Act is not sufficient if it violates the Equal

13

Protection Clause.

14

Have we ever said that ­­ I mean it's

15

obvious, but have we ever said that in the context of

16

what the voting rights requires?

17

MR. BRNOVICH:

Your Honor, this ­­ this

18

Court has consistently, from Reynolds v. Sims, has

19

always held that the concept and the principle of

20

one­person, one­vote, any attempts to undermine that

21

outside ­­

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So we have said that

23

even ­­ you read our cases saying even minor deviations

24

are not permitted if they are statutorily required?

25

GENERAL BRNOVICH:

No statute can trump the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

Constitution, and so if ­­ the Voting Rights Act,

2

whichever way it's read, can't be read in a way that

3

would violate the one­person, one­vote.

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's what Judge Wake

said in his dissent.

6

MR. BRNOVICH:

7

Wake said in his dissent.

And that's exactly what Judge

8

And that is the State's position, is that we

9

don't dispute ­­ or we're not saying that complying with

10

the Voting Rights Act may indeed be a legitimate State

11

interest.

12

in the systematic way where you have a one­way ratchet,

13

where you have consistently minority ability­to­elect

14

districts, essentially using votes based on racial or

15

ethnic classifications, and under­populating those

16

districts and then overpopulating other districts, what

17

you have done is essentially undervalued or violated the

18

one­person, one­vote ­­

19

What we are saying is, is that when it's done

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you say it's correct

20

that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the desire

21

to obtain preclearance, is at least like other

22

traditional districting considerations, like respecting

23

county lines, respecting municipal lines, having

24

contiguous districts?

25

Would you agree with that?

GENERAL BRNOVICH:

Yes, Justice Alito.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if ­­ if that is the

2

case, then is this what you were asking us to say with

3

respect to the Voting Rights Act, that the things that

4

were really necessary to obtain preclearance are

5

legitimate, but you can't go ­­ but they went further.

6

They ­­ they went beyond what was really necessary to

7

obtain preclearance, so we would have to determine

8

whether that was true or not, or some court would have

9

to determine whether that was true or not.

10

MR. BRNOVICH:

In this instance, because of

11

the systematic way the deviations, the under­population

12

occurred, as well as the intention ­­ we know from the

13

Independent Redistricting Commission that they

14

intentionally under­populated those districts.

15

have all that evidence.

16

So we

However, we do believe that the Voting

17

Rights Act is like any other criteria.

18

these population deviations and they're incidental, not

19

intentional ­­ and that is the key, I believe, is when

20

you intentionally under­populate and systemically

21

under­populate these districts ­­ that's what causes the

22

constitutional harm.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if you get

Well, what if the only way

24

that you ­­ that a State could obtain preclearance when

25

Section 5 was still in force was to under­populate some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

districts?

Would that be permissible?

2

GENERAL BRNOVICH:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well ­­

Just as you might have a

4

situation where the only way in which you could respect

5

municipal lines or county lines was to under­populate

6

some districts to some degree.

7

MR. BRNOVICH:

Justice Alito, the irony is

8

in the draft maps; seven of the ten minority

9

ability­to­elect districts were under­populated.

10

However, when the Independent Redistricting Commission

11

went from the draft maps to the final maps, there was a

12

one­way ratchet.

13

under­populated those districts.

14

They intentionally and systemically

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But Justice Alito can

15

protect his own question, but he's asking you whether or

16

not a deviation is permissible for protecting

17

communities of interest, protecting municipal lines,

18

whether some slight deviation is permissible.

19
20

MR. BRNOVICH:

23

Yes, Justice Kennedy,

if it's incidental and not intentional.

21
22

Yes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm not sure what

that means.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I'm not sure.

I had

24

thought you ­­ I had thought you were saying that it

25

doesn't matter whether you were doing it to obtain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

Justice Department clearance.

2

that is unconstitutional.

3

MR. BRNOVICH:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You cannot do something

That is ­­
If in fact you're ­­ you

5

don't have equally apportioned districts, it goes beyond

6

what is tolerable.

7

whether you're ­­ you're actually trying to comply with

8

the Justice Department.

9

saying?

10

It's a violation, regardless of

MR. BRNOVICH:

Isn't that what you were

Yes, Justice Scalia, but I

11

think that it's important to note that we look at this

12

as a qualitative not a quantitative analysis.

13

isn't like some magic number where you say at this point

14

this becomes unconstitutional or it doesn't.

15

So there

The State's position is, is that compliance

16

with the Voting Rights Act was like other neutral or

17

traditional criteria, like protecting, as Justice Alito

18

alluded to, communities of interest, geographical

19

boundaries.

20

may have incidences where you get somebody ­­ some

21

districts above or below the line.

And so in that ­­ in considering that, you

22

So the fact that a district may be below the

23

line in and of itself is not a constitutional violation.

24

The harm occurs when the Independent Redistricting

25

Commission systemically under­populates those

Alderson Reporting Company

1

districts ­­ those ability­to­elect districts, and

2

overpopulates other districts thereby ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

those people.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm just not really

7

sure.

8

says we want to respect county lines.

9

that we want to do one­person, one­vote, but we think we

Let's ­­ let's say that there's a policy that

11

and there's a policy.

deviation on the one­person, one­vote metric.

We want to respect county lines,

MR. BRNOVICH:

I guess, you know, the road

20

to hell is paved with good intentions.

21

position is, regardless of their intention, if they are

22

doing it in a systematic way or intending to

23

overpopulate certain districts, under­populate other

24

districts, that is unconstitutional.

25

And so our

purposefully ­­

­­ in the sense of we have a

policy to maintain county lines, that's impermissible?

9

MR. BRNOVICH:

Yes, Justice Kagan.

The

10

position of the State is that when it's done in a

11

systematic and intentional manner, when you create,

12

essentially, barrios of ­­ boroughs, excuse me ­­ of

13

certain folks, and then you overpopulate other

14

districts, that violates this Court's one­person,

15

side of the case?

You ­­ you were defended in the

MR. BRNOVICH:

The ­­ the Secretary in the

upholding that principle was very, very important, and

24

this case.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

with your colleague that it doesn't make any difference;

that in the end result, the ­­ the legislature ­­ that

the Republicans were disproportionately advantaged, had

18

a disproportionate share of the seats?

19

MR. BRNOVICH:

position is, is that that really is irrelevant as far as

the numbers ultimately, whether the percentage ­­

Our ­­ the key to the State's argument is

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

There is no basis for concluding that the

2

motive was partisan?

MR. SMITH:

I don't think that's a fair

4

characterization of what the district court found, Your

5

Honor.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. SMITH:

Oh, really?

Why?

The district court found that

8

the predominant motive for the under ­­ for the

9

population ­­

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Predominant motive.

That's

right.

12

MR. SMITH:

It said that ­­ that there may

13

have been two of the five commissioners who, as to one

14

district, District 8, had some mixed motives in ­­ in

15

urging that that district be made more competitive, but

16

did not find that the Commission as a whole acted, even

17

in that one instance, with partisan motivations, and

18

it ­­ that district is not one of the ones that's

19

significantly under­populated.

20

The decision to move population around and

21

make that district somewhat more competitive, even if it

22

was motivated by partisanship, has nothing to do with

23

what we're really talking about here, which is the 8.8

24

deviation.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you know, I would be

Alderson Reporting Company

very upset if ­­ if it ­­ there was any motivation of

2

partisanship because ­­ I wish this case had come up

4

approved your commission, despite the ­­ the text of the

5

Constitution ­­

8

was going to end partisanship, get politics out of

redistricting.

case which ­­ which asserts that there has been a lot of

partisanship on the part of this ­­

what happened, and not a fair characterization of what

17

the district court found after a full trial.

18

found, after giving them a full opportunity to try to

19

prove their claim that there was some invidious

20

discrimination here, is that's simply not what happened.

21

What it

Instead what happened is that they had ­­

22

these population deviations emerged in the final part of

23

the process as they worked to make sure that their map

24

would pass preclearance on the first try, something that

25

the State of Arizona had failed to achieve in each of

Alderson Reporting Company

the three previous decades.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the district court

3

found ­­ and this is on 79a of the Appendix to the

4

Jurisdictional Statement ­­ "partisanship played some

5

role."

6

if there was no partisanship, everything would have come

7

out exactly the same way?

8

on the districting?

So do you want us to interpret that to mean that

9

MR. SMITH:

It had no affect whatsoever

10

respect to the changes to District 8, which by the way,

11

remained a largely Republican­leaning competitive

12

district, that two of the commissioners may have had

13

mixed motives, both thinking about aiding the

14

preclearance arguments and also thinking about bringing

15

the Democratic party up closer to parity, it still

16

didn't get to parity.

Well, that's a ­­ that's a

red herring.

you'll get 55 percent of the ­­ of the representatives.

interests me about the case.

district court did, that partisanship is not a

legitimate consideration, and it's not, like, respecting

opinion as finding that partisanship was part of the

reason for the plan that was adopted, then is the test,

what we normally apply in a constitutional mixed motive

situation.

case, or is it what the court said in Bush v. Vera and a

But my

For all the same reasons that

the Court has many times said we're not going to say any

it predominates, I would think you would want to follow

the same approach, even if you're going to adopt the

considerations, which makes no sense.

that is clear, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Voting

First of all, it's a tiny role in this case.

21

But second of all, even if it were the only

22

reason why you had a ­­ population deviations under

23

10 percent, I think it would be not defensible for this

24

Court to say that, by itself, is unconstitutional.

25

There is so ­­ de minimis effect on any

interest in terms of representation from this difference

of population, absent some bias in the way that the

the ­­ even if the pure motive was ­­ was partisanship,

it's simply not something that ought to be taken

But here, where the predominant motive is to

try to make sure these districts will pass preclearance,

10

and less than 50 ­­ 50 percent of the commissioners may

11

have had, for one district, where they increased the

deviation slightly, like .2 percent, may have had some

partisanship as well as the Voting Rights Act in mind

the ­­ all ­­ the only evidence they have of

that every single change to those 10 districts that

only ­­ if the only problem is deviation, to be

unconstitutional, I would recommend that you not do that

21

for the reasons you said in your dissent in Larios.

22

But, boy, this ­­ this case is so far from that.

23

mean, the Republican commissioner ­­ appointed

24

commissioners are voting for everything that they're

25

complaining about because they, too, want to get

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

45

preclearance.

2

The State of Arizona wants very much to have

3

its map go into effect for the first time since the

4

1960s when it became covered by the Voting Rights Act,

5

rather than having a Federal court have to put the map

6

into effect because preclearance was denied.

7

And they ­­ they hire lawyers who worked in

8

the Justice Department, told them how many districts

9

they needed, told them that if necessary in rejiggering

10

these lines, they could go down ­­ up to the 10 percent

11

limit.

They then tried very hard to minimize that.

12

And one of the things that's important to

13

recognize here is you could have probably equalized the

14

population here and still gotten districts to the same

15

level of Hispanic population, but you would have had to

16

draw tentacles of the kind that the Court has many times

17

criticized.

people in the State of Arizona who are not in these

districts, but that's because they're spread out all

districts, if you're going to draw districts that

tracts and communities of interests, something has to

25

give.

And what gave here was this modest, tiny, small

amount of population variation that seems to me just not

2

a serious candidate for any kind of constitutional

invalidation on the facts of this case, which aren't

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is not whether

15

Section 5 can compel deviations from a perfect

16

population standard.

17

deviations are permitted by the Constitution.

18

Court has made very clear that when State districting

19

plans are within the 10 percent deviation, total

20

deviation from a perfect population equality standard,

21

those plans are presumed to be constitutional.

22
23
24
25

The question is whether de minimis
This

Now, that presumption is a substantive rule
that serves three important principles.
Just if I can briefly tick them off, the
first is that such de minimis deviations do not by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

themselves violate equal protection.

2

giving States a 10 percent leeway actually enhances

3

citizens' fair and equal representation by allowing

4

States to pursue other important districting principles.

5

And the third is that limiting Federal court

6

intervention in de minimis deviation cases protects

7

State's sovereign right to draw districts for their own

8

legislature.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The second is that

Is ­­ is 10 percent

that the Court has made is that these sort of, you know,

I don't think that's contested here.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the other

side is willing to ­­ to concede that it's presumptively

2

okay, which means they have to come forward to show that

3

there were invalid reasons why there is this

4

discrepancy.

5

Right?
MS. HARRINGTON:

That's true.

And our view,

6

Justice Scalia, is that the case should begin and end at

7

the prima facie case requirement.

8

plaintiffs did not make a prima facie case of invidious

9

discrimination in this case, and so the district court's

Our view is that the

10

factual findings about the Commission's actual motives

11

actually aren't relevant at this point.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

13

thought a prima facie case means if ­­ if you haven't

14

made a prima facie case, it means you have to bring in

15

other evidence.

16

I

It doesn't mean you're out of court.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, if you haven't made

17

the prima facie case, it means that the State doesn't

18

have to justify its reasons for the deviations.

19

in this context, in order to make ­­ in really any

20

context, to make a prima facie case, what you have to do

21

is put in enough evidence from which an inference of

22

invidious discrimination can be made.

23

And so

What that generally requires is that the

24

challenger has to put in enough in evidence to rebut the

25

presumed reasons for the challenged action.

Alderson Reporting Company

In this

49

case the Arizona ­­ Arizona constitution sets forth the

partisanship was a consideration.

10

So are you saying that that finding can't be

11

sustained because it wasn't based on sufficient evidence

12

brought forward by the plaintiffs?

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, first, just a point

14

of clarification.

15

just talking about District 8, and so it wasn't defining

16

that partisanship played any role with respect to the

17

rest of the map.

18

from which you were quoting, the district court said

19

that the amount of deviation that was attributable to

20

the attempts to make the district more competitive was

21

less than 1 percent.

Part of the opinion that you read was

And if you read on in the paragraph

I think it was .7 percent.

22

And so it's really a small, very small ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, was it a factor or

not?

But, again, our ­­ our first position is
that this Court doesn't need to get to what the actual

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think this Court's

23

decisions have told us that it's ­­ that it's fine to

24

have partisanship play some role in redistricting.

That's the ­­ that's the lesson of Gaffney.

In footnote 10 of the district court's

MS. HARRINGTON:

Can you give me the page,

please?

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's on 62 ­­ I'm sorry ­­

8

63a, running over into 64a.

9

paragraph that begins at the bottom of the page, "For

10

decision purposes, a majority of the panel made up of

11

Judge Clifton and Judge Silver have concluded that

12

Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that partisanship

13

predominated over legitimate redistricting

14

considerations."

15

And in the ­­ the final

Doesn't that mean that they found that there

16

were some illegitimate considerations, or at least

17

they ­­ and they assumed that partisanship was an

18

illegitimate consideration?

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

20

They say that on 79a, which

is where you were reading from earlier ­­

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

No, no.
­­ I think it's clear that

23

what they're talking about, that partisan ­­ that

partisanship played a role only with respect to

deviations in districts ­­

the opinion.

Yes.

That's my reading of

disagree with that, but you can ask them.

11

You know, if this Court makes it too easy

12

for plaintiffs to come in and point to deviations and

13

partisan correlations, then it's going to totally wipe

14

away the 10­percent leeway, which itself serves

important districting principles.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK F. HEARNE, II

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

22

MR. HEARNE:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

you agree with ­­ with the characterization that the

not.

And the portion I would quote was not

this redistricting process, and is demonstrated

What factual finding other than footnote 10
is there?

16

MR. HEARNE:

Then I would quote from the

17

Appendix at 107a, which is where the statement's made,

18

"Judge Clifton correctly finds that the IRC was actually

19

motivated by both partisan advantage and hope for voting

20

rights preclearance."

21
22
23

So we have a majority for that finding of
fact.
So that is two members of the court

24

specifically found that partisanship was one of the two

25

motives to explain these deviations from one­person,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

one­vote.

2

even Judge Silver noted, this is a mixed­motive case.

So clearly, it was a motive at that point, as

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but to what extent?

4

mean, the other side's going to say, yes, that's true,

5

but it's only true as to that one district discussed in

6

footnote 10.

7

MR. HEARNE:

I

Well, if that's so, then they

8

would have stopped and adopted the initial map and not

9

continued to deviate from 4 percent to 8 percent for the

10

final map.

11

4­percent deviation.

12

The initial map, the draft map, was a

Dr. King, their own expert, said that this

13

map complied with the Voting Rights Act.

14

went after that and continued deviating and

15

under­populating districts to get to the 8.8 percent.

16

That included the machinations with District 8.

17

And yet, they

18

obtain preclearance, then they would have accepted the

But they

They went ahead and conducted these

said they kept going.

I think ­­ I think that that's why they

MR. HEARNE:

The explanation that was made

2

is that they were, quote, "strengthening" these

3

districts by continuing to under­populate districts

4

because their consultant said, oh, that does help us get

5

Voting Rights Act preclearance approval.

6

explanation made.

7

That was the

But if their own expert said the original

8

map, the draft map satisfied the Voting Rights Act, and

9

the only reason to additionally depopulate these

10

districts was to achieve a further partisan skew, which

11

Judge Wake's chart demonstrates, then that shows that

12

partisanship was a very ­­ I understand two of the

13

members said that it was not the primary motive, but it

14

certainly was a pervasive motive in the process by which

15

these districts were drawn.

16

And our position is a very narrow one that

17

we ask the Court to hold, is that partisanship does not

18

justify deviating from one­person, one­vote, and that a

19

mistaken belief that preclearance was necessary to

20

under­populate certain districts also does not justify

21

deviating from one­person, one­vote.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But where ­­ where

23

is the district in which ­­ or the State in which

24

partisanship does not play a role in redistricting?

25

MR. HEARNE:

Well, we think partisanship is

always going to play a role.

2

there's an outer limit, as certainly ­­ as ­­ as

3

Justice Scalia noted, a articulateable, justiciable

standard of one­person, one­vote.

can cabin the partisanship.

Even ­­ if ­­ if you're

saying that even within the 10 percent, you know, to go

20

from 1 percent to 2 percent, or from 2 percent to

21

3 percent, and then somebody can come in and say that's

22

partisanship, it means that every single plan will be up

23

for grabs in every single place, doesn't it?

24
25

MR. HEARNE:

I don't think it does.

And the

answer would be it doesn't, because in this case, there
