United States.

Mr. Hansmeier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL T. HANSMEIER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HANSMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Until three weeks ago, a sex offender who

12

moved to a foreign country was not subject to any

13

Federal registration requirement in the United States

14

unless and until he returned to the United States.

15

Below, the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that it is a

16

Federal crime for a sex offender who moves to a foreign

17

country to fail to ­­ to report that move.

18

Circuit was wrong for three overarching reasons.

19

SORNA's text does not include a requirement to

20

unregister.

21

The Tenth
First,

Second, SORNA's statutory history reveals

22

that if Congress wanted to include a requirement to

23

unregister, it would have done so just as it did before

24

SORNA's enactment.

25

unregister is unnecessary because all 56 jurisdictions

And finally, a requirement to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

require sex offenders to unregister.

2

is a violation of the jurisdiction's law and not Federal

3

law.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

Kansas law in this case.

6

Kansas law.

7
8

Failure to do so

That would be true of

It would have violated the

Is that true?
MR. HANSMEIER:

He had an ­­ he had a

requirement to tell Kansas of his departure, correct.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How does it work

10

normally?

11

goes to Illinois and registers in Illinois.

12

any obligation, one, for him to register or deregister

13

in Kansas, and does Illinois have an obligation to

14

notify Kansas?

15

Say a person under SORNA leaves Kansas and

MR. HANSMEIER:

Correct.

Is there

So what happens in

16

practice is that SORNA sets minimum Federal standards.

17

And those minimum Federal standards are supplemented by

18

the States, the additional, more stringent requirements.

19

One of those more stringent requirements is the

20

obligation to unregister, and, yes, Kansas has that

21

obligation.

22

So in your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg,

23

that individual has to unregister in Kansas under State

24

law, and when he gets to Illinois, that's the Federal

25

requirement to tell Illinois ­­ to register, to update

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

the registration in Illinois because that's the

2

jurisdiction where he resides.

3

16921(b)(3) will tell ­­ will tell Kansas of the ­­ of

4

the move.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. HANSMEIER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

And this is in addition

to the ­­ the other venues.

And in Illinois under

If there are any, correct.
So it would be both

Federal and a State requirement.

But in one case, it's

on the SORNA person and the other, it's the other State.

11

MR. HANSMEIER:

I think that's correct, yes.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Under ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What sense does it

17

register, you're triggered and State law says, well,

18

you've got to unregister too.

19

if you don't unregister, that's not included under the

20

Federal law?

21

law like that?

22

And in the one case, if you don't

But if you unregister ­­

Why would ­­ why would Congress draft a

MR. HANSMEIER:

Well, I ­­ I think they

would have done that because ­­ and if you look at the

offenders not at initial registration but when ­­ when

2

the sex offender crossed State lines.

5

were going missing.

11

requirement to unregister in Kansas, that's actually not

12

enforceable under SORNA because the travel has to come

13

after or before he's ­­ he can't register.

14

And if he were to have a Federal

So if Mr. Nichols were a State sex offender

15

and ­­ he's only committed an offense when he leaves

16

Kansas.

17

we're saying that there's a Federal requirement to

18

unregister in ­­ in the departure jurisdiction.

19

that may work for Federal offenders, but I think the

20

idea is that there are Federalism concerns underlying

21

SORNA.

22

when an individual crosses State lines, and that's the

23

minimum requirement in SORNA.

24
25

And that doesn't ­­ and that's a problem if

Now,

And those Federalism concerns come into play

problem to require him to register, but all of a sudden

Right.

There is an arrival jurisdiction.

what it's going to be.

21

he's going to go two days, and he's going to look

22

around.

23

I

He doesn't know

He's just there two days.

MR. HANSMEIER:

And

Well, I ­­ I think SORNA

24

doesn't do a good job of this.

25

they define "resides" as the location of one's home or

The definition of ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

the location where one habitually lives.

2

think that SORNA does not do a good job of this, but I'm

3

not sure that that wasn't unintended.

4

think about the ­­ the ­­ the window, the

5

three­business­day window ­­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. HANSMEIER:

And so I do

Because if you

Yes.
­­ that ­­ that actually

8

creates a system where an individual is not on the

9

registry for a certain amount of time.

If you think of

10

a change of name, which you have to report, if you have

11

three business days to do that, there is going to be up

12

to five days where that registry is inaccurate, and

13

that's just the way it is.

14

So I think, although we might not want to

15

admit it or ­­ but the ­­ the reality is that SORNA

16

actually creates these gaps by allowing offenders some

17

period of time to register.

18

that because it knew the States could supplement SORNA.

19

These are just minimum standards.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I think Congress did

You have a textual argument

21

that I ­­ that I understand, but one of the arguments

22

you mentioned at the outset was that an examination of

23

the legislative history shows that Congress intended to

24

produce the sort of result that was produced here, and I

25

wonder if that's really a plausible argument.

If you're correct, then two things happen;

at least two things happen.

4

5

adverse consequences for a lot of people.

6

why Congress would have wanted that to remain.

7

One, Kansas retains on its

I don't see

And do you really think Congress was

8

unconcerned about the United States exporting pedophiles

9

to the Philippines or to other countries?

Do you think

10

that ­­ that they were not concerned about not only the

11

human rights implications of that, but our relations

12

with other countries?

13

MR. HANSMEIER:

Well ­­ well, I think if you

14

look at the legislative history, there ­­ there's

15

nothing to indicate that ­­ that SORNA in 2006 had

16

anything to do with international travel.

17

the new legislation is important in this regard, because

18

whether ­­ I don't ­­ I don't know that I said

19

"intended."

20

the ­­ the history of it shows more or less that in

21

1996, each State had a registration system.

22

later, Congress required departure notification,

23

required unregistration.

24

all the jurisdictions.

25

And I think

If I said that, I didn't mean it.

I think

One year

By 2006, that had happened in

So I think what I mean by the "statutory

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

history" is that that's ­­ that's an indication why

2

there was no unregistration requirement put in SORNA,

3

because it existed in all the jurisdictions.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if I could then come

5

back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical of someone like

6

your client who moves from Kansas to Illinois, what, in

7

the language of the statute, would prevent that person

8

from going to the registry office in Kansas before

9

departing and reporting there that he was moving to

10

Illinois and his new address in Illinois would be

11

whatever it would be?

12

­­ under the language of the statute?

13

agree that it does?

14

Why does that not fit under this

MR. HANSMEIER:

Or would you

Well, I would agree that

15

there's nothing that prevents him from doing that, and I

16

would agree that he should do that under State law,

17

but ­­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if you ­­ if you agree

19

to that, then I don't see why ­­ why there is a

20

difference between that situation and the situation

21

where the ­­ the person leaves Kansas and goes to the

22

Philippines.

23

MR. HANSMEIER:

Well, what ­­ but I don't

24

agree that it's a ­­ it's sufficient or a Federal

25

requirement to do it before.

That ­­ I think that's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

distinction I would make ­­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would it not be ­­

3

MR. HANSMEIER:

­­ it's not a requirement.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would it not be

5

sufficient under 42 U.S.C. 16913(c)?

6

MR. HANSMEIER:

Well, because that provision

7

is still going to require ­­ and the government, I

8

think, agrees with this.

9

requirement is to report in the arrival jurisdiction.

10

There is still a ­­ the ­­ the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it says, "shall not,

11

later than three business days after each change of

12

residence, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction

13

involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that

14

jurisdiction of the change of address."

15

So prior to leaving, he is within the period

16

of not later than what ­­ than three business days after

17

the change of residence.

18

to the registry office in Kansas, he is residing in

19

Kansas.

20

And at that time when he goes

So he falls within subsection (a).
MR. HANSMEIER:

Well, this is on ­­ the text

21

is on page 11A of the blue book.

22

what's ­­ the blue brief.

23

is ­­ is if you looked directly above subsection (c) to

24

subsection (e), I think this is what you're really

25

saying Congress did.

I think ­­ I think

I think what's important

Subsection (b) sets forth two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

subsections, the first of which begins with the word

2

"before."

3

"not later than three business days after."

4

The second of which begins with the phrase

So I think if Congress had meant to do

5

something structurally similar in subsection (c), it

6

would have done it, but it didn't.

7

"not later than three business days after."

8

I think the change is a trigger, and I think that's ­­

9

that's key, and it's similar to subsection (b)(2) where

Instead, it just did
And ­­ and

10

the trigger is being sentenced.

11

event has to happen, that occurrence has to happen

12

before you report it.

13

And ­­ and so that

happens, you can't really report it and satisfy this

provision.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

SORNA required Petitioner to register and to

7

keep his registration information current.

8

an unregistration requirement, but a requirement to keep

9

his registration current in the jurisdictions where he

This is not

10

was registered by timely giving notice of any change of

11

residence to at least one jurisdiction involved.

12

And we disagree with Petitioner.

We think

13

Kansas was a jurisdiction involved pursuant to

14

subsection (a) here, both because of the meaning of that

15

phrase, which is more capacious than just taking down

16

the phrase that appeared in subsection (a), and also

17

because it's reinforced by Section 16921(b)(3).

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it your position that

19

he was required to notify Kansas both that he was

20

terminating his residence and that he was moving to the

21

Philippines, or just that he was terminating his

22

residence?

23

MR. GANNON:

Here it's just that he's

24

terminating his residence.

25

information about where he was going.

He could have given

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But he was not required

to?

MR. GANNON:

But that is ­­ that is not what

4

he was being required to do here.

5

to keep his registration information current by saying

6

where he will ­­ where ­­ where he is residing, and he

7

will ­­ he is no longer going to be residing here.

8

The phrase that ­­

He was being required

Would it ­­ in your view ­­

­­ would it have been

14

compliant with SORNA simply to say I am leaving Kansas,

15

period?

16

MR. GANNON:

That would have complied with

17

his obligation to keep his registration information

18

current with the jurisdiction involved, yes.

19

The ­­ we do think that Section 16914(a)(3)

20

allows him to report where he resides or will reside,

21

and therefore, he can report future information, and

22

therefore, the guidelines, promulgated by the Attorney

23

General in 2008, says that normally when somebody's

24

moving from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction, he

25

should tell Kansas, I am leaving Kansas and this is

Alderson Reporting Company

where I'm going next, so Kansas can give that other

2

jurisdiction warning.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

5

MR. GANNON:

But the ­­ the Philippines

That's correct.

And so what we

6

think is key here is that Kansas is still a jurisdiction

involved pursuant to subsection (a).

a jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a).

Congress didn't

Well, all right.

15

an employee, or is a student.

16

When he's in the Philippines, there's no

MR. GANNON:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, but we think that that's not the only thing

purpose of the registry is to enable to us to have a

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Gannon ­­

­­ and he has not yet given

4

notification to at least one jurisdiction, that that is

5

no longer true.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems to me that what

7

you're saying is that each of those offenders is

8

supposed to recognize the underlying purpose of the law,

9

which is to have accurate registries, and to do

10

everything he can to serve that underlying purpose.

11

we would ­­ you know, it would be good if everybody did

12

that.

13

And if you look at this text of the law, there's just no

14

way that a reasonable reader reads that text and says it

15

requires me to provide departure notification when I

16

leave to another country.

And

But the text of the law is something different.

17

MR. GANNON:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well ­­
So you can say well, he's

19

supposed to keep it current, and ­­ and that's right.

20

He is ­­ he should keep it current, because we would all

21

like sex registry.

22

specific details about what it means to keep it current,

23

and it seems to me he has conformed with every single

24

one of those requirements.

25

But the statute provides very

MR. GANNON:

And we just don't think that's

But he didn't have to

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

MR. GANNON:

­­ this statutory language.

But it is subsection (c) that

12

provides the content for what it means to keep the

13

registration current, and it says you have to inform at

14

least one jurisdiction.

15

That's the problem here.

16

He informed zero jurisdictions.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It ­­ it says he has to have

17

informed at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to

19

only jurisdictions that they're talking about are the

20

jurisdictions in which he currently either lives, works,

21

MR. GANNON:

time and manner implementation of this provision, which

7

is also authorized under the new statute, requires him

8

to report such changes in purpose after he's already in

And if so, and he doesn't say, well, I

thought I was here on vacation, but it turns out I'm

be a violation because he needs to report the purpose of

MR. GANNON:

Where it specifically picks up

and says, you have to go back to where you last

22

registered, we think that goes beyond ­­ that's the way

23

in which Kansas law goes beyond SORNA, because SORNA

24

does not always require that.

25

We think that in a situation like this,

Alderson Reporting Company

47

SORNA effectively required that, because there's no

2

other place for him to have gone.

3

Petitioner's concession that SORNA permits him to comply

with the requirement to keep his registration current by

5

going to the office in Kansas.

6

And it's the same form.

But we also take

There's no doubt

7

that it's possible for him to report the change in

8

residence there.

9

And it has location start date and location end date,

10

The form says, what is your address?

and those can be reported in advance or after the fact.

11

Our position is just that when SORNA gets

12

around to saying what it means to keep your registration

13

information current, you have to do that in at least one

14

place within three business days.

15

that means he could do it in Kansas even the day after

he moved.

17

And so we think that

If you disagree with that, we still think it

also must mean at least, as Justice Alito was

with it by doing it while there still is one

15

don't think I actually reserved time for rebuttal, so

16

thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. HANSMEIER:

I forgot to say that, but

thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. HANSMEIER:

23

25

Okay.

Oh.

Justice Breyer, if I can ­­

I'll ­­ I'll be brief.
On the guidelines ­­ this is actually a
direct quote ­­ the ­­ the ­­ according to the

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

54
1

Department of Justice, "A jurisdiction may require that

2

changes in registration information be reported by

3

registrants on a more stringent basis than the SORNA

4

minimum standards.

5

of residence be reported before the sex offender moves

6

rather than within three business days following the

7

move."

8
9

For example, requiring that changes

I mean, that's our position.

I don't ­­

there are other portions in ­­ in the guidelines that

10

direct jurisdictions to do this.

11

what the ­­ what the guidelines say right there is ­­ is

12

exactly what we say, that it ­­ it is a more stringent

13

requirement.

14

But that ­­ but ­­ but

A few other points on the word "current."

15

think if you ­­ if you look in the ­­ in the ­­ there's

16

a provision on in­person verifications where there is

17

requirements for a current photograph.

18

clearly doesn't mean a future.

19

important to understand, that when you're talking about

20

current information, it's not future information.

21

think Justice Kagan mentioned that a few times.

22

That word

And I think that's

I

On 1621 ­­ 16921(b)(3), again, that's ­­

23

that's language directed towards the jurisdictions.

24

That's not a requirement for the offender, and that's

25

how the former jurisdiction would be informed of the

Alderson Reporting Company

change.

And if there are no other questions.
