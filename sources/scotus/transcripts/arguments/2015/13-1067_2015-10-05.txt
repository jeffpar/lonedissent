CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUAN C. BASOMBRIO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

This personal injury action is based upon an

12

accident that occurred in Austria.

13

agrees, there's no need to reach the other question

14

related to agency, so I will start first with the

15

based­upon issue.

16

If this Court

In Nelson, this Court set forth a framework

17

to analyze the based­upon question.

18

that courts must begin their analysis by identifying the

19

particular conduct on which the action is based.

20

decision uses words such as basis, foundation, and

21

gravamen.

22

And this Court held

The

So here ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in ­­ in that case,

23

there was a distinction between State activity ­­ that

24

is, police activity ­­ and the commercial activity in

25

hiring the plaintiff.

Here, I think it's conceded that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

the activity ­­ running a railroad ­­ that's commercial.

2

So we don't have the commercial/State action division.

3

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Yes, Your Honor, that's

4

correct.

5

activities.

6

the United States, and the other one are the acts and

7

omissions that resulted in the accident in Austria.

8
9
10

Here, there are two alleged commercial
One of them is the sale of the ticket in

So what I would suggest is that we look at
the complaint and see what it is that the plaintiff has
alleged.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just as a matter of

12

background, suppose a hypothetical case ­­ no foreign

13

sovereign.

14

Would there then be jurisdiction under the Due Process

15

Clause in your view?

16

that issue, but as a background issue, what ­­ do you

17

have a position?

18

It was a private corporation in Austria.

You don't have to prevail on ­­ on

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Our position is that if OBB

19

was a private entity, there would not be jurisdiction

20

over OBB.

21

this Court holding in Daimler and there would also ­­

22

There would not be general jurisdiction after

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And Daimler is your best

23

case for that proposition?

24

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Yes, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do ­­ do you think that it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

the same test?

2

jurisdiction test here, based­on, arising­from, that we

3

are basically asking the same question as we would be

4

asking if this were a ­­ a foreign corporation?

5

In other words, is the test a specific

MR. BASOMBRIO:

I don't believe so, Your

6

Honor.

7

could have chosen that wording in the personal

8

jurisdiction analysis in the case law, but they decided

9

on another phrase, based­upon, instead.

Let me explain, if I may, why not.

Congress

So I believe

10

that what this Court needs to do is give some

11

guidance ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but why ­­ I mean, it

13

doesn't seem to me that that wording is very different

14

from the wording that we've used in specific

15

jurisdiction cases.

16

we've used "arising out of."

17

"related to."

18

clear that the FSIA is meant to ensure that when a

19

foreign government is acting as a commercial actor, it

20

gets treated like a foreign corporation.

21

language here is very similar, right?

22

insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact,

23

and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of

24

relationship between that contact ­­ contact and the

25

claim.

The wording here is "based on" ­­
Sometimes we've used

In some respects ­­ I mean, it's pretty

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

There's the

6
1

So it seems ­­ I guess the question is:

Why

2

should we think of these two questions as at all

3

different?

4

it would hurt you if they were the same, because it

5

might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction

6

here, you know?

7

thinking why it is that there ­­ that there would be a

8

different test.

9

And I don't know, by the way, I mean, that

But I guess I'm having trouble of

MR. BASOMBRIO:

The reason why is because

10

the FSIA takes place of the ­­ both the subject matter

11

jurisdiction analysis and the personal jurisdiction

12

analysis.

13

I would agree certainly that some aspects of the

14

personal jurisdictional analysis are part of that test,

15

it goes beyond that.

16

jurisdiction which is a different set of policy

17

determinations that Congress made that are in some way

18

overlapping of the personal jurisdiction questions, but

19

I don't think they're completely aligned.

20

Both are combined into one test.

So although

It also goes into subject matter

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm ­­ I'm sorry.

21

I'm ­­ I don't even understand why we're talking about

22

based­upon.

23

As Justice Ginsburg said, there's no dispute

24

here that whether the based­upon is the ticket sale or

25

the operation of the train, both of them are commercial

Isn't the work in substantial contact with

the United States?

at instead?

5

enough?

6

here, did it have a substantial contact with the

7

United States?

8
9

Isn't that what we should be looking

Was this commercial activity substantial

The operation of the train and the ticket sale

MR. BASOMBRIO:

There's a three­step

analysis, Your Honor, in Nelson.

First, you have to

10

identify the particular conduct, the actions, not the

11

causes of action, which is what the en banc court did.

12

They focused on the legal claims.

13
14
15

This Court said you have to focus on the
acts.

Here, the acts ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we did that in the

16

context of deciding when something was a sovereign act

17

as opposed to a commercial act.

18

commercial act.

19

We know this is a

So ­­ and we ­­ I'm just confused.

Why

20

isn't the work ­­ why shouldn't the work be done by

21

substantial contact with the U.S.?

22

MR. BASOMBRIO:

It's a three­step analysis.

23

First, you identify the activity.

24

whether it is commercial or not.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Secondly, you decide

Whether it's ­­

substantial contact.

3
4

And third, whether there's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ commercial or

sovereign.

5

MR. BASOMBRIO:

6

What I'm saying is that the Ninth Circuit

7

erred.

8

looked at the legal claims.

9
10
11

So there are three steps.

They didn't look at the conduct first.

They

If you look at the ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even if they had looked

at the conduct, it's commercial.
MR. BASOMBRIO:

It's commercial.

But if you

12

look at the conduct and you identify it as the accident

13

in Austria ­­ which is what the plaintiff claimed.

14

JA 15, paragraphs 3 to 8, they alleged that there was an

15

unsafe boarding platform, a gap at the platform,

16

et cetera, et cetera.

All of these things happened in Austria ­­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

But how do you propose ­­

19

how do you propose that we determine whether it's based

20

on commercial activity?

21

Take their failure­to­warn claim.

Why isn't

22

that based on something that occurred in the

23

United States?

have a tort that occurred in Austria, a negligence tort

2

that occurred in Austria, and they're just trying to

3

plead around it with these other claims?

4

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Well, there's no allegation

5

in the Complaint that the failure to warn was something

6

that happened in the United States.

7

same set of paragraphs, 3 through 8, that relate to the

8

acts and omissions in Austria.

9

It's found in the

It also would make no sense to argue that

10

there was a failure to warn in the United States because

11

that would mean that the Eurail Pass itself would have

12

to warn about all conditions at hundreds of potential

13

railroad stations in Europe.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it might be ­­ it

15

might be a claim that couldn't prevail, but why does

16

that answer the question?

17

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Well, the failure to warn

18

that's alleged relates to the facts that arise in

19

Austria, and, therefore, the cause of action arises in

20

Austria because that's where the acts or omissions

21

occurred if ­­ if one looks at what's alleged in the

22

Complaint itself.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Would ­­ would you agree

24

and ­­ and, as you've been doing, take out the agency

25

question ­­ but would you agree if ­­ if what had

Alderson Reporting Company

happened here was that the ticket was not honored.

2

know, the plaintiff bought a ticket, and the ticket was

3

not honored, and ­­ and the suit was where the ticket

4

was purchased, would you agree that that's based­on?

5
6

MR. BASOMBRIO:

If this was a breach of

7
8

You

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just a breach of contract

MR. BASOMBRIO:

­­ and the breach ­­ the

case.

9
10

allegation of the breach was that when the Respondent

11

showed up they did not honor the ticket, that would be

12

based upon an activity in Austria because it's in

13

Austria that that ticket got honored.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In Austria, even though she

15

bought the ticket in the United States?

16

the breach of contract case could not be brought in the

17

United States?

18
19

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Correct, because the ­­ the

wrongful act, the breach, arises in Austria.

MR. BASOMBRIO:

I believe ­­ let me clarify,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

Your Honor, if I may.

2

My answer to Justice ­­ Justice Kagan was

3

that I believe that a breach of contract claim for

4

dishonor of the ticket in Austria has to be brought in

5

Austria.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because ­­

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Justice ­­ because that's

8

where the breach occurred that gives rise to the cause

9

of action.

disagree with you, can you still win the case?

12

answer was, I could still win, I believe, under the

13

agency alternative argument.

22

the question ought to be decided not ­­ not by where

the ­­ where the contract was breached but where the

24

contract was made?

25

hold that, and that would not affect your case.

I mean, we could hold ­­ we could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

MR. BASOMBRIO:

That's true.

I ­­ I do not

2

believe that a breach of contract claim under the fact

3

scenario that you provided, Your Honor, would give rise

4

to a claim in the United States because the breach

5

happened ­­ would have happened in Austria.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, I want to come

7

back to Justice Kagan's speculation of ­­ of whether

8

based­on is ­­ is nothing more than due process.

9

It seems to me that the definition of

10

commercial activity carried on in the United States by a

11

foreign state is the due process test.

12

is, "A commercial activity carried on in the

13

United States by a foreign state means commercial

14

activity carried on by such state and having substantial

15

contact with the United States."

16

like ­­ like the due process test.

17

The definition

That sounds to me

But what is required here is not just a

18

commercial activity carried on in the United States, it

19

has to be based on a commercial activity carried on in

20

the United States.

21

something ­­ something added to the ­­ to the

22

constitutional test.

23

And it seems to me that is

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that's

24

why I started my discussion by referring to this

25

holding ­­ the holding of this Court in Nelson which has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1
2

to look at the particular conduct.
The particular conduct at issue is not the

3

sale of the ticket, it's the acts and omissions that

4

resulted in the accident in Austria.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What ­­ what if

6

there are acts or omissions in two ­­ let's say you have

7

a flight from New York to Vienna.

8

someone negligently sets or whatever they do with the

9

landing gear, okay?

10

And in New York,

So then the plane takes off, and then in

11

Vienna, because of the negligence in New York, it's a

12

rough landing, somebody gets a concussion.

13

MR. BASOMBRIO:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Uh­huh.

15

gravamen of the action in that case?

16

in ­­ in the United States?

17

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Where is the
Can you bring that

Potentially, you could bring

18

it in the United States.

19

your scenario and this case is that in that scenario,

20

the service was provided, started in ­­ starting in the

21

United States.

22

because the foreign airline came here and conducted a

23

commercial activity in the United States.

the negligence occurs in one place, and the impact is

4

far as our notions of personal jurisdictions, either

7

jurisdictions.

8
9

Those are typical long­arm bases of

So the Chief's hypothetical where the
negligence occurred in the United States, that you agree

10

would be a case that could be brought in the

11

United States because the relevant conduct occurred

12

there.

13

MR. BASOMBRIO:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct, in that case ­­
Well, correct.

15

don't understand, then, what gravamen means in the

16

Nelson decision.

I

MR. BASOMBRIO:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

could have a lot of different ­­ I mean, if it's the

20

gravamen of your complaint, I think you have to choose,

21

don't you, one or the other?

22

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Well, I would ­­ I was ­­ I

23

would understand your example, Chief Justice, to mean

24

that the act that caused the injury was whatever they

25

didn't do upon takeoff to the plane, or ­­ or ­­ as I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

understood your example, that cause of that injury was

2

in the United States.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So can you have more

4

than one place under the based­upon analysis in Nelson,

5

or has you ­­ have you got to decide there's only one

6

place where you could bring the action?

7

MR. BASOMBRIO:

8

and this is something I thought about.

9

complicated example because we have conventions,

Well, the airline example ­­
It's somewhat a

10

international treaties that deal with ­­ with airline

11

cases.

12

I would imagine that, theoretically, there

13

could be one more ­­ more than one location, but not on

14

the facts of this case.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the Chief Justice's

16

example, he ­­ he stated that there was negligence in

17

the United States.

18

that?

19

But what if there's no evidence of

There's a ­­ there's a problem with the

20

landing gear when the plane lands in Austria, and the

21

claim is that there was a failure to inspect in the

22

United States, or a failure to do proper maintenance in

23

the United States.

24
25

Would that be different?

MR. BASOMBRIO:

That may be different.

Again, because the transportation was provided from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

United States geographically, there ­­ there is no doubt

2

in that question that commercial act was carried on in

3

the United States by the airline.

4

here.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's different

I suppose it's ­­ it's ­­

6

it's proper to say that where you have negligence that

7

causes an injury, the ­­ the complaint is based on both.

8

You ­­ you don't have liability without the negligence.

9

You don't have liability without the injury.

So why

10

can't you say based­on, in ­­ in that situation, would

11

enable either one to ­­ to sustain the cause of action?

12

MR. BASOMBRIO:

In the airplane example,

13

perhaps either jurisdiction.

14

look at the Complaint ­­ and we're guided by the

15

allegations of the Complaint, it is ­­ the acts are only

16

alleged to have happened and the omissions to have

17

happened ­­

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this example, if you

Getting back to our

19

earlier discussion, questions from me and from Justice

20

Kagan, it seemed to me you have to say the due process

21

analysis is insufficient under this statute because ­­

22

then fill in the blank.

23

you the same question.

And Justice Scalia was asking

24

MR. BASOMBRIO:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yeah.
One ­­ one answer might be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

because otherwise there would be no necessity for a

2

statute.

3

counterargument is, well, there has to be because the

4

statute makes the distinction between sovereign and

5

commercial and so it has a real purpose.

6

Due process applies anyway.

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Right.

But the

The due process

7

analysis is incorporated into the statute, but it's not

8

the only thing to think about.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

For example ­­
You did answer, I

10

think ­­ you did answer, rendering Justice Kennedy's

11

question somewhat academic, that there would be no

12

specific jurisdiction in the United States if all that

13

happened here was a ticket purchase from an agent where

14

the injurious conduct occurred abroad and the railroad

15

operates solely abroad.

16

You answered that whether it were the due

17

process specific jurisdiction inquiry or the Foreign

18

Sovereign Immunities Act, the answer would be the same,

19

that the ticket sale in the United States was not

20

enough.

21

MR. BASOMBRIO:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.
But, of course, my

23

question was suppose that the due process analysis is

24

sufficient to sustain jurisdiction.

25

does based­on still have a separate meaning as a

Alderson Reporting Company

Then what?

Then

Official

19
1

separate requirement that has to be met and has not been

2

met here?

And if so, why?

3
4

MR. BASOMBRIO:

because from a general jurisdictional perspective ­­

5
6

It has not been met here

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But not general

jurisdiction.

7

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Right.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I was really talking about

9

specific jurisdiction.

10

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Okay.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, of course, Justice

12

Scalia is absolutely right with respect to general

13

jurisdiction, that all you look at is the contacts.

14

with respect to specific jurisdiction ­­ this is a

15

company that doesn't have pervasive contacts ­­

But

16

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Right.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

­­ it's critical to the due

18

process analysis that there be a relationship, and a

19

real relationship between the particular contact with

20

the United States and the lawsuit in the exact same way

21

that this statute focuses on.

22

And so, again, I don't know if it hurts you.

23

It might be, as Justice Ginsburg says, that there

24

wouldn't be specific jurisdiction here for a

25

corporation.

But ­­ but ­­ but why shouldn't we treat

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

those two things exactly the same way?

2

MR. BASOMBRIO:

There is ­­ there is ­­ if I

3

may answer that two parts of your question.

4

there is no specific jurisdiction if OBB were a private

5

entity because the Respondent is not suing for breach of

6

the ticket; it's not alleging that it was not honored.

7

She's suing for something that happened in Austria.

8

specific acts happened outside the United States.

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

First,

The

Well, that's an answer

for why there is no specific jurisdiction here.

11

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Right.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you can make the exact

13

same answer in the completely private context.

14

you ­­

And

15

MR. BASOMBRIO:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ could well be right.

17

Right.
I'm

want to ask Mr. Fisher about that.

18

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Right.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's not an answer for

20

why the tests should be different.

21

MR. BASOMBRIO:

The test ­­ the test ­­ my

22

belief is that the test should incorporate due process

23

analysis.

24

matter jurisdiction, which is a different analysis than

25

personal jurisdiction, there are other policy

But because we are also dealing with subject

considerations.
The policy considerations decisions that

3

Congress made were based on territory.

4

if one looks at the first, the second, and the third

5

clause, they're all territory­based distinctions.

6

in the case Amerada Hess, this Court held that tort

7

actions are meant to be encompassed by the second

section of the ­­ of the exception, the non ­­

9

noncommercial torts exception.

If one want ­­

It

Justice Ginsburg referred to direct effects.

14

That would come under the third clause, which deals with

15

commercial activity outside of the U.S.; again, a

16

territorial line, having an effect here.

17

The first clause draws the territorial line

18

here and says that commercial activity has to happen in

19

this side of the line within the United States.

20

that's what we don't have here.

21

I would like to ­­

what provision are you referring to?
MR. BASOMBRIO:

I'm pro ­­ referring to the

though Congress, in line with its objective of treating

foreign government engaging in commercial activity in

the same way as they would be treated in the foreign

language that's virtually synonymous with the language

that we use in specific jurisdiction cases.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

But ­­ but it ­­ it did it in

the context of a statutory structure that is designed to

9

protect foreign sovereign immunity and not to draw U.S.

courts into what could be very sensitive international

questions of having U.S. courts pass judgment on what

12

happens in a foreign country.

discussion of the distinction between commercial

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to start with Justice Sotomayor's

7

question which I think has been asked a couple of other

8

times today, which is, what would the answer be if this

9

were a private defendant?

And in footnote 11 of our

brief on page 33, we explain why the answer would be

11

that there would be specific jurisdiction.

I don't know of a single case where we have

said specific jurisdiction can be based on a connection

22

that had nothing to do with the injurious conduct.

23

MR. FISHER:

But, Justice Ginsburg, I think

24

there are plenty of cases that support the proposition

25

that when a company markets and sells a product in a

Alderson Reporting Company

jurisdiction, that creates specific jurisdiction.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's the difference

8

between saying that they have to warrant their product,

9

which is an opera house, to be safe, to say that they

10

have to warrant their trains safe for ­­ for passage?

11

can't see a difference.

12

normal in a contract to say that the seller of the

13

product is implicitly warranting fitness.

14

MR. FISHER:

And it seems to me it's very

Isn't it?

Well, all I can say is in this

15

case, we're suing on the exact warranty that gives rise

16

from this ticket sale, Justice Breyer.

And I think ­­

That's ­­ that's the

commercial activity supports you.

So I want to know what is there, in the law

of sovereign immunity particularly, that argue ­­ leans

4

in your favor.

5

MR. FISHER:

So, Justice Breyer, to ­­ let

6

me be clear about what is and is not in that brief.

7

There are no cases that I don't think any party has

8

cited.

9

on the language in various conventions, that this claim

What the ­­ what that brief says is that based

10

wouldn't be able to be brought somewhere else.

11

language in those conventions are things like arise

12

under, based upon, and so you basically end up in the

13

same situation as you are here which is having to decide

14

whether this claim can be brought.

But the

15

Remember that brief also alleges and it

16

actually spends more time alleging that there is no

17

proper principle­agent relationship, which I think is ­­

18

the Court has probably realized is not a very credible

19

argument.

20

putting too much weight on a brief that simply cites

21

some treaty language.

22

So I think you should be careful about

But I think the point I want to make, and

23

this ­­ for the hypotheticals and to bring it back to my

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You can ask him on rebuttal.
Could you tell me, your

8

adversary claims you've been trying to change what your

9

claim is.

10

Is it based on the ticket sale?

Or is it

based on the operation of the train?

11

MR. FISHER:

I think the better reading of

12

the word "activity" in the statute for the reasons we

13

describe in our brief is the overall integrated activity

14

of running the railway train enterprise, which includes

15

selling the product and delivering the product.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see our interests, but

I'm thinking there are 190­some­odd countries in the

MR. FISHER:

Well, I don't know why any

3

country would have thought that about this country's

4

law, because before this ­­ you know, up until this

5

point, the law in the lower courts, the D.C. Circuit and

6

the Second Circuit, and most ­­ most specifically, have

7

held that in this exact situation, there is

8

jurisdiction.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe ­­

And Justice Breyer ­­
­­ they would've

12

read ­­ if they had read our opinion in Nelson, that

13

would have given them a good inclination to read

14

sovereign immunity the way Justice Breyer suggests.

15

MR. FISHER:

No.

I'm glad you asked about

16

Nelson, Mr. Chief Justice, because the paragraph in

17

Nelson that Mr. Kneedler is referring to is

18

distinguishing sovereign activity from commercial

19

activity.

20

and was not concerned with the geographic nexus, and you

21

know that because in that paragraph where it lists the

22

things upon which the Nelsons' claim is not truly based,

23

it lists not only the recruitment in the United States

24

but the actual employment in Saudi Arabia.

25

The Court in Nelson did not have before it

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, he has a paragraph in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40

Nelson, one sentence of which helps you, that he says

5

6

helps you.

7

They entered into a
The Nelsons are heard

I take it that's the basis of it, and this

But he says before even taking each of the

8

Nelsons' allegations about the recruitment and

9

employment is true, those facts entitle the Nelsons to

10

nothing under their theory of the case, which isn't

11

contract.

12

which happened in the hospital abroad and not the

13

arguably commercial activities that preceded their

14

commission that formed the basis for the Nelsons' suit.

But, he goes on to say, it's these torts,

15

MR. FISHER:

17

So ­­
You see.

And so ­­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

The basis for.

Justice Breyer ­­
­­ that's why I'm thinking

it does not help you.

21

MR. FISHER:

When the Court said the

22

arguable commercial activities that preceded it, they

23

were talking not only about the recruitment in the

24

United States but also the employment itself in Saudi

25

Arabia.

And they were distinguishing that from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

police activity of seizing somebody and holding him in

2

jail, which was what the case was really about which

3

were sovereign activities.

4

So the Court in Nelson ­­ Mr. Chief Justice,

5

to be clear, I'm not saying Nelson supports me.

6

Nelson simply doesn't answer this question because you

7

were concerned in that case with sovereign versus

8

commercial, not geographic nexus.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think

So in line with the

10

discussion we had earlier about specific jurisdiction,

11

is your argument that general jurisdiction is enough to

12

support based­upon under the statute?

13

MR. FISHER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

I ­­

Well, I thought you

15

talked about just all of the different commercial

16

activities that the Austrian airline engaged in in the

17

United States.

18

commercial activities, that sounds like general

19

jurisdiction, not the specific jurisdiction.

20

And if it's all of the different

MR. FISHER:

No.

But in point of fact,

10

the Chief Justice is suggesting is, like, that seems

11

wrong.

MR. FISHER:

Well, let me say two things,

Justice Kagan.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I think that is the

16

fairest reading of the statute, and Mr. Kneedler was

17

talking about the House Report.

18

the House Report of a commercial activity was running an

19

airline.

20

from running a train system.

It's hard to distinguish running an airline

So the terms of the statue do

cover that.
If ­­ Justice Alito, may I ­­ may I just say
one more thing to Justice Kagan?

Alderson Reporting Company

43
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. FISHER:

Sure.

Finish your answer.

Which is if you didn't agree

3

that the term "commercial activity" covered the entire

4

enterprise, then you would ask the question whether the

5

activity of selling tickets is enough to create a

6

based­upon argument in a specific jurisdiction since we

7

went back to the conversation we've been having.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose Ms. Sachs was

Australian, and she bought this ticket on the Internet

10

in Australia.

11

sovereign immunity in the suit in the United States?

12

Would you say that there would be no

MR. FISHER:

Well, there wouldn't

13

necessarily be sovereign ­­ there may not be sovereign

14

immunity under the terms of the Act.

15

there would be a number of reasons why that case

16

couldn't be brought ­­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But obviously,

4

And obviously, that would carry with it the

And this is one thing I want to make sure,

5

is the Court understands to bring us back to the

6

hypotheticals we were talking about earlier and to tie

7

in the contract hypothetical, it's important for the

8

Court to understand there are all manner of cases where

9

a duty is created in this country by way of a foreign

10

state's commercial activities, and then injuries or

11

breaches occur a broad.

12

oddball case.

In fact, this is rather the

13

The more typical case is a high­finance deal

14

like the bonds case in the Weltover case, other kinds of

15

international finance and loans.

16

employment cases where United States citizens sign an

17

employment contract or are lured abroad, study abroad

18

programs in the educational sphere, all kinds of

19

situations where a duty is created in this country, but

20

then all of the events that the lawsuit turns out to be

21

about happen abroad.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are many

Well, if ­­

If that's the case ­­
Mr. Fisher, you ­­ you

recognize ­­ I think you recognized in your brief that

this ­­ you can call it a question of first impression.

2

You ­­ you said, I believe, based on ­­ the meaning of

3

based­on in this context is an open question.

4

And if it is an open question, why should we

5

allow a foreign carrier to be sued in the United States

6

for acts or omissions overseas ­­ the negligent conduct

7

occurred overseas ­­ when the only link, the single link

8

is a ticket, a pass, purchased from a ­­ a travel agent

9

in the United States?

10

MR. FISHER:

For all the reasons I was just

11

saying, Justice Ginsburg, because it is utterly common

12

for duties to be created in this country ­­ here, the

13

duty of safe passage and of utmost care ­­ and then the

14

breach to occur a broad.

15

My ­­ my friend on the other side was

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If that's true, I don't

25

way you did, because in my hypothetical question I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

thought you said that there would not be jurisdiction to

2

sue in the United States when I slip and fall in Vienna.

3

And ­­ but you could make the same argument.

4

Well, there was a duty created in the United States, and

5

that's what I'm suing on.

6

MR. FISHER:

I think when I answered your

7

question I was imagining there wasn't a duty created.

8

Maybe as Justice Breyer amended the hypothetical, there

9

might be ­­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, there's ­­ I mean, the

11

only thing that's happened in the United States is that

12

I've purchased a ticket there.

13

I've done.

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's ­­ that's what

Right.
So I take it that your

16

argument is that purchase of a ticket gives rise to a

17

duty which is then violated when I slip and fall in

18

another country.

19

MR. FISHER:

I would say if the plaintiff

20

alleges that in the lawsuit, then there would not be

21

sovereign immunity.

22

as he was saying earlier, you would have a ­­ perhaps a

23

very strong 12(b)(6) argument that there's no such State

24

law claim that actually gave rise in that context.

25

And then Justice Alito's ­­ I think

Without regard to ­­ in other words, there's

5

nothing special about buying a ticket in the

6

United States that gives rise to a unique duty of care

7

that's any different from the duty of care that the

8

railroad owes its passengers in Austria.

9

MR. FISHER:

I think that's right, Mr. Chief

Justice, but ­­ as long as you're talking about buying a

11

ticket one place to the other.

14

on where you buy it.

15

But of course that's

But the critical thing is where did they

16

sell their ticket?

17

22

there's nothing unique about the standard of care based

upon whether it's a Eurail Pass or something else, is

25

I'm just trying to suggest that you're

putting an awful lot of weight on the standard of care

2

created by the purchase of the ticket.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher, the

purposefully­availed­of test relates to specific

jurisdiction, and there has to be an instant connecting.

21

If there is that connection, then you must have, in

question as to whether your warranty claims ought to be

further highlights the difficulty with the other side's

It has to be enough for a duty to create a

17

that only one particular place can be the gravamen,

18

which is the way I understood it from their briefing.

19

But as the Court, I think, is figuring out from this

20

argument, you get into all heaps of troubles with

21

contracts, employment, all kinds of other things where

the injuries occur abroad, and how on earth is the Court

the train and the platform, negligently designed.

4

What law would govern whether that platform

5

was negligently designed, whether the boarding protocol,

6

operating protocol was negligent?

7

MR. FISHER:

In all candor, Justice

8

Ginsburg, there'd be a pretty good argument that Austria

9

law should apply.

And it is important for the Court to

10

understand that simply holding that a suit under the

11

FSIA can be brought in this country does not mean that

12

U.S. law applies.

13

analysis that can be made.

15

decided not to.

16

There's a separate choice of law
And so OBB had the

But remember, they can do choice of law

17

analysis not only in terms of ordinary common law

18

principles that might apply in a court, but there's a

19

number of ways that a defendant in OBB's position can

20

protect itself in a case like this.

21

First of all, they can put a choice of law

22

provision in the ticket, or in the contract, or whatever

23

might be at issue.

24
25

Second of all, even as to forum, forum
selection clauses can be put into tickets like this, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

contracts, and in fact they are.

2

told the Court at the cert stage of this case, all of

3

these tickets now are governed by a forum selection

4

clause provision, so you'll never see a case like this

5

again, not only in the railroad context, but even in the

6

airline industry.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As the United States

And that ­­ and that

8

works, even though it's an adhesion contract, and it's

9

small print ­­

10

MR. FISHER:

Under Carnival Cruise Lines,

11

this Court's decision, those kinds of forum selection

12

clauses are perfectly enforceable.

15

MR. FISHER:

That ­­ that was an

Well, I don't know why it would

16

be different in this context, Justice Kennedy.

17

Certainly the government says that these are all

18

governed by forum selection clauses now.

19

are, too.

20

We think they

So what you're really deciding in this case,

21

if I could end where perhaps I began, is you're not

22

deciding transportation in this case, because all

23

transportation cases are now covered by conventions and

24

forum selection causes.

25

what the law should be in the mainstream FSIA cases,

What you're really deciding is

2

has filed a case on behalf of a ­­ of a large hedge fund

3

that says, we do business all the time with foreign

4

sovereigns and we're very worried that if the Court

5

adopts this gravamen based­upon, we will not be able to

6

enforce contracts and duties in this country that have

7

given rise under negotiations in this country and then

8

are breached abroad.

9

That's why Gibson­Dunn

Employment situations, like the hypothetical

10

we give in our brief, where a United States citizen is

11

hired as an engineer to go do oil and gas exploration

12

and then something happens abroad.

13

Those cases have always been brought in this

14

country.

15

what you'll be saying is the courts now have some

16

amorphous test that would seem, especially if there is

17

only a single gravamen, that would seem to bounce all of

18

these cases out of the United States courts, which would

19

be dramatically ­­

20

And if this Court adopts the gravamen test,

Well, suppose ­­ suppose

We don't have to buy any gravamen or

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think there is two

4

reasons why you couldn't just limit it to that,

Justice Ginsburg.

6

depends on the duty that arose when that ticket's

7

purchase was made.

8

distinguish duties that arose in a ticket sale from

9

other kinds of duties that arise and all kinds of other

10

First, as a legal matter, our claim

And I don't see any legal way to

marketing and contract settings.

11

And second of all, just as a matter of

12

common sense, remember ­­ let's go back to where we

13

began ­­ this is a commercial activity exception.

14

they weren't selling tickets, it wouldn't even be

15

commercial to begin with.

16

holding to say that the one thing that makes this

17

commercial is what prevents it from being brought in the

18

United States.

19

So it would be a highly odd

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What makes it commercial

20

is it's a railroad doing the same thing a private

21

railroad would do.

22

a railroad.

23

If

It's in ­­ its business is operating

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

24

And if you want us to ask the question in terms of

25

whether a private company would be subject to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

jurisdiction under the same settings here, at least all

2

you have to hold is that OBB should be in the same shoes

3

as a private company.

4

Now, we say in our brief and in the Gibson

5

brief in more detail, why due process wouldn't stand in

6

the way of jurisdiction there.

7

doubt about that, you can note that OBB has made a

8

personal jurisdiction argument in the district court

9

that the district court never reached.

10

But if you have any

And so that is

available on remand.

11

The only thing before this Court is

12

sovereign immunity and whether OBB is entitled to

13

sovereign immunity for commercial acts in this country

14

and the teeth of a congressional statute that says in

15

the declaration of purpose in Section 1602 that foreign

16

states doing commercial activities in this country

17

should not be entitled to sovereign immunity.

18

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BASOMBRIO

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19
20

Thank you, counsel.

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

21

Much of our discussion today has been in

22

separating the torts from the contractual claims here in

23

this case, implied warranty claims.

24

I believe it's a bad idea to split claims on causes of

25

action.

Let me tell you why

This Court decided recently a case called

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

Pimentel in which the Republic of the Philippines had

2

sovereign immunity.

3

other defendants that did not enjoy sovereign immunity.

4

And this Court, taking into consideration important

5

issues such as international comity, decided that under

6

Rule 19, the entire lawsuit had to be dismissed,

7

including as to nonsovereign entities, in order to give

8

full effect to the sovereign immunity of the Republic of

9

the Philippines.

10

But there were also a number of

In light of that holding, it would make

11

little sense that when the defendant has the right to

12

invoke immunity, that we would split the causes of

13

action so that some of them would proceed in Austria and

14

some of them would proceed in the United States.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you suggesting the

16

based­upon determination is not done on a claim­by­claim

17

basis, it's ­­ you look at the entire complaint?

MR. BASOMBRIO:

That's why ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

You find the gravamen of the

entire complaint?

MR. BASOMBRIO:

understood what gravamen means.

means.

25

and we asked them, why is the Respondent suing, each

person would say, because she was injured in a terrible

2

accident in Austria.

3

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if the only claim

were the breach of warranty claim?
MR. BASOMBRIO:

Then we would have to ask

6

where did the breach occur.

7

question, I would answer, if the breach occurred in

8

Austria, then the claim would arise in Austria.

9

As in Justice Kagan's

Now, the warranty, in terms of the duty of

10

care, there is no duty of care until she arrives at the

11

station and tries to board that train.

12

didn't have a ticket at all, the record establishes that

13

we would still owe her a duty of care.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And even if she

What if she also had, in

15

addition to the claims she's asserted, a conventional

16

breach of contract claim?

17

when she tried to get on the train, they said no, your

18

Eurail Pass doesn't let you get on free, you have to pay

19

an additional amount?

She said that when they ­­

20

MR. BASOMBRIO:

That would have said ­­

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

We look to the gravamen of

22

the whole thing and we say, well, the tort claims are in

23

Austria and therefore she can't bring this breach of

24

contract claim in the United States?

25

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Well, if she had been ­­ if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62

she had been hurt and in addition to that, they would

2

have told her ­­

3
4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, exactly what happened

here, plus she said they made me pay extra.

5

MR. BASOMBRIO:

Then the gravamen would

6

still be Austria because that's where all those events

7

took place.
