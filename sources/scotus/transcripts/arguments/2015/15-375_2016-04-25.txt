ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

When Congress modified the American Rule in

12

the Copyright Act, it was not just trying to punish

13

those who took unreasonable positions.

14

encourage parties to advance important principles even

15

where the other side's arguments are good; indeed, I

16

would say, especially where the other side's arguments

17

are good.

It wanted to

18

When a defendant is trying to decide whether

19

to fight for a principle, the availability of attorneys'

20

fees can make all the difference in that decision, and

21

in turn can make all the difference in whether the

22

public's rights are vindicated.

23

The Second Circuit's standard flouts.

The

24

plain language of the statute undermines Congress's goal

25

and is consistent with this Court's opinion in Fogerty.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

It does nothing to encourage a defendant who has a good

2

defense but is facing off against a powerful adversary

3

armed with a reasonable position.

4

has not happened once in the last 15 years.

5

once in 187 cases decide ­­ decided under the Second

6

Circuit's Matthew Bender rubric, and will never happen

7

anywhere outside the Second Circuit.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That encouragement
That's not

Mr. Rosenkranz, if

Kirtsaeng had lost this case ­­ if he had lost this

10

case, should fees have been awarded to Wiley, given the

11

significance of this decision?

12

important decision.

13

before the Court.

14

would Wiley be entitled to attorneys' fees?

15

I mean, it's an

It needs both sides to be aired

So suppose he had lost and Wiley won,

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Wiley would have an

16

argument, Your Honor, certainly on one of the factors

17

that we have suggested, which is it would say we won an

18

important case.

19

It didn't win it against the ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would have had more

20

than that.

21

could have been woefully infringing, correct?

It would have had circuit precedent.

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

Not ­­
If I were going to bet,

I would say yes to that question.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It

Wouldn't you?

I'm sorry.

Alderson Reporting Company

Our client

infringed.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

5

Right.

So our client had a lot

already weighing against him.

6

But just to get back to finish the answer to

7

Justice Ginsburg's question, but there would have been

8

other factors.

9

court would have evaluated what the incentives for both

The Court would have ­­ the district

10

sides were.

11

economic incentive to advance its position.

12

would have had much less of an incentive to do anything

13

other than to cave.

14

So Wiley would have had an enormous

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

business he was engaged in.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Why?

Kirtsaeng

It was a lucrative

Your Honor, he was a

17

student who had this side business who was making just a

18

few dollars per book.

19

large volume, but the ­­

I mean, it was a ­­ it was a

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Several hundred thousand.

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Several hundred thousand

22

dollars in revenues, Your Honor, but not in profit.

23

as to Wiley ­­ as to the books of Wiley that he sold, it

24

was $37,000, Your Honors, for which he was hit with a

25

$600,000 judgment, which also would have been considered

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

by the district court.

2

would have asked itself:

3

It would have thought ­­ it
Is this fair?

But the problem with the Second Circuit's

4

position is that it prejudges in every case there is

5

going to be substantial weight on the reasonableness.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rosenkranz, just to

7

continue on with what Justice Ginsburg was asking you.

8

As an ex­post matter, you have a great David versus

9

Goliath story to tell.

But as an ex­ante matter, I

10

wonder if the rule that you suggest is not going to harm

11

the Kirtsaengs of the world.

12

And you know, you might take these couple

13

things into account:

14

will probably think that the ­­ that they are spending

15

less on their lawyers than the John Wileys of the world.

16

And that they're also more risk averse, because they

17

have less money.

18

doesn't your rule, actually as an ex­ante matter, cut

19

against the Kirtsaengs of the world?

20

That the Kirtsaengs of the world

So, you know, given those two factors,

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the answer is

21

no, and for this reason.

22

when they are facing off against a John Wiley, the first

23

questions on their minds before they ever think about

24

attorneys' fees being awarded against them is how am I

25

going to pay for this?

The Kirtsaengs of the world,

And critical answer to that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

question will be in many circumstances, there's the

2

availability of attorneys' fees ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but that's only one

4

side of the question.

5

you're upping the stakes generally so that Kirtsaeng is

6

going to know, well, it's true I might be able to get my

7

fees back; but at the same time, I run the risk of

8

having to pay John Wiley's fees.

9

said, is probably going to be paying its lawyers more

I mean, what you're doing is

And John Wiley, as I

10

than I'm going to be paying mine.

11

risk­sensitive as a Kirtsaeng type.

12

deal for me to increase my stakes that much.

13
14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And I'm very
So that's a huge

Your Honor, understood.

That will be part of the calculus.

15

Now, in the Ninth Circuit where the test

16

that we are suggesting predominates, and in every

17

circuit that doesn't accept the Second Circuit's

18

position, which is to say every other circuit, there is

19

not a dearth of copyright litigation.

20

Kirtsaeng's position are fighting ahead.

21

that?

22

with making reasonable judgments and asking the

23

question:

24

the next case, what are the incentives that will

25

appropriately incentivize both the plaintiff to push on

People in
And why is

It's because district courts have been entrusted

and the defendant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you

3

told ­­ I thought you told us that there haven't been

4

any awards under the ­­ maybe I misunderstood ­­ the

5

Second Circuit test in 15 years.

6

you were making at the beginning, 187 cases, 15 years?

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Or what was the point

178 cases, Your Honor, that

8

were decided under the Second Circuit's Matthew Bender

9

standard, not once did any defendant ­­ defendant, that

10

is, ever prevail in receiving attorneys' fees except

where the plaintiff ­­

But I thought your

18

point ­­ your point now is that the defendants in

19

copyright cases still show up.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

22

the Ninth Circuit.

23

The Court:

24

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Okay.
So in the Ninth Circuit,

plaintiffs show up, starving artists show up, and

3
4

starving artists defend.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And they don't in

the Second Circuit?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Then the truth is there are

5

very few starving artists in any copyright litigation.

6

So, yes, they may show up, but they won't be able to pay

7

for their own lawyer.

8
9

And so ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you suggest that one of

the solutions to that problem is for the district court

10

to take into account the relative financial resources of

11

the parties; is that correct?

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, as ­­ as

13

one of the factors.

14

do in every case, in addition to all of the footnote 19

15

factors, is to ask itself:

16

same position reads the precedents or their lawyers read

17

the precedents, what lessons will they glean from them?

18

And one of the things a district court should be

19

analyzing in every case looking backwards is:

20

would have been the right economic incentives for this

21

plaintiff and this defendant?

So what the district court should

What

Is there anything ­­

have we ever said that the availability of attorneys'

party?

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it's ­­ it's

3

certainly ­­ it has long been a part of the standard

4

that courts have consistently applied in attorneys' fees

5

cases.

6

evaluate the incentives, and the incentives run both

7

ways.

This Court said in Fogerty you've got to

8
9

A John Wiley did not need attorneys' fees in
order to proceed, and was not worried about attorneys'

10

fees, in order to protect its interest in a

11

$1.8­billion­a­year business for which, on this

12

particular issue, it stood to gain hundreds of millions

13

of dollars.

14

15

It wasn't worried about whether it would

A Kirtsaeng, on the other hand, would have

16

been worried about that under ­­ under any standard.

17

And in a standard where he stands to gain attorneys'

18

fees for defending, that would have been an important

19

incentive to ­­ to encourage him to soldier on ­­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz ­­
­­ under ­­
­­ it does sound like, as

23

Justice Kagan put it, that your rule is if David faces

25

reasonable Goliath's position was.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's what it seems

to come down to.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it doesn't.

On

that factor of ­­ I mean, there are easily six factors a

court should be considering.

5

better positioned than a Goliath to make the argument

6

that he should get fees.

7

There's, what else does the defendant stand to gain?

8

What does the plaintiff stand to gain?

9

motivations of the parties?

10

On that factor, a David is

But there's a lot more to it.

What were the

One of the factors that the district court

11

said was completely irrelevant was, what was the

12

significance of the win to the public?

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So all of ­­

So one thing that concerns

14

me about a test like that, Mr. Rosenkranz, is it's very

15

hard for people to make judgments ex ante and to figure

16

out what their chances are.

17

And if you're concerned about the Kirtsaengs of the

18

world, the Davids in these kinds of suits, what you

19

might want is a pretty clear safe harbor.

20

It's very hard to predict.

In other words, if I'm taking a reasonable

21

position, I'm not going to be stuck with the other

22

side's fees, which are likely to dwarf my own.

23

that's something that somebody can predict, as opposed

24

to this 22­factor test, which it's like I just don't

25

know how this is going to come out, and I might well be

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

stuck with John Wiley's fees, depending on what judge I

2

draw and, oh, a number of other things that I don't have

3

any control over.

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Understood, Your Honor.

So

5

what the ­­ what the Congress did was to select a

6

standard based upon the totality of the circumstances.

7

It affirmatively rejected the standard that sat there in

8

the Patent Act and in the Lanham Act that was based on

9

exactly the clear line that you've described, Your

10

Honor, exceptional circumstances.

11

To this day, Wiley has not explained how its

12

test is any different from the one that Congress

13

adopted.

14

It's exactly what Justice Kennedy ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

What is ­­ what about ­­ I

15

suppose I start this thinking district judges do have a

16

job.

17

do worse, not better.

19

the ­­ our case was:

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

I ­­

So you don't

want to believe that.

4

correction of what you believe is a failure to apply to

5

realize what Fogerty meant.

6

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

7

10
11

So you want case­specific

Is that the idea?
Yes, Your Honor.

So let me

be more precise.

8
9

Okay.

I've already said one of the things that is
wrong with the Matthew Bender standard, that it is
atextual.
A second thing, directly to the question on

12

Fogerty, is that Fogerty says, quote, "defendants who

13

seek to advance meritorious copyright defenses should be

14

encouraged to litigate them.

15

Matthew Bender that encourages a defender to litigate.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

There" is nothing in

No, but you want us

17

case­specific or you want us to say something?

18

one ­­ one whole ­­ one result would be the Second

19

Circuit seems not to have taken account of what we said,

20

which is that all considerations ­­ all considerations

21

that are consistent with the purposes of the Copyright

22

Act can be relevant.

23
24
25

I mean,

It depends on the case, period.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Although, I ­­ I would add a little bit more.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I ­­

You wanted this other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

thing, which I don't know how to do.

2

whether you really advance the law.

3

the time, Marbury v. Madison was viewed by many people

4

as being just about an appointment, and it didn't really

5

advance the law.

The other thing is

Your Honor ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe others thought it

8

did.

I don't know.

10

How do we know which advances the

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, district courts

11

know what cases are advancing the law and what cases are

12

more specific ­­

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Rosenkranz, I ­­ I

think that Justice Breyer is getting to something.

15

Put on a hat that doesn't want to win

16

outright.

17

announce a rule.

18

that the Second Circuit rule obviously stacks everything

19

in favor of a winning plaintiff, publish a winning

20

copyright holder because 80 percent are now winning, if

21

not more.

In the Second Circuit, it's almost 89

22

percent.

It means, when you're talking about the

23

reasonableness of a ­­ a winning party's position, in

24

most cases the copyright holder has a reasonable

25

position.

Okay?

Put on a hat where we're trying to
And I'm sympathetic to your argument

So ­­ and the defendant, by losing, tends to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

have an unreasonable position.

2

I looked at what happened after Fogerty, and

3

the ­­ after Fogerty and Fantasy, that's where the Ninth

4

Circuit tests began.

5

different incentives for plaintiffs and defendants.

6

can't make the reasonableness of the position the

7

centerpiece for prevailing defendants, or otherwise,

8

they're never going to get fees, or hardly ever.

9

And the Court there said there's
You

So going back to Justice Breyer's question,

10

how do we articulate what the Second Circuit is doing

11

wrong without necessarily endorsing all of the factors

12

of the Ninth Circuit?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Understood, Your Honor.

14

The simple answer is:

15

to pick one factor out of a jumble of possible factors

16

and say, this will be the one that gets substantial

17

weight.

18

then hold up that one factor and ask, is there anything

19

that outweighs that factor when, in the context of a

20

particular case, that might not be the most important

21

factor?

What the Second Circuit did was

And what the district courts do with that is

22

But I see the Court wrestling with ­­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the test would be,

24

it's okay to have it one among others, but not a

25

presumption that says that's always going to entitle you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

to defend against an award or to win an award.

2
3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Agreed.

And what Matthew

Bender does is essentially to announce a presumption.

4

But I see the Court wrestling with ­­ with

5

how to articulate a test.

6

four sentences in a way the district courts can

7

administer.

8
9

I can articulate the test in

So our rule is that a district court should
consider the totality of the circumstances, including

10

all of the Fogerty factors, and ask itself, would a fee

11

award here advance the purposes of the Copyright Act?

12

Is this the sort of case in which, if the same scenario

13

were to present itself again, the availability of fees

14

would create the right litigation centives ­­

15

incentives, that is, for both parties with the right

16

result for the public?

17

The district court should ­­ should consider

18

each of the Fogerty factors and do it through the lens

19

of the purposes of the Copyright Act.

20

consider the significance and nature of the win and the

21

litigation incentives on both sides of the deed,

22

including any disparity in resources.

It should also

23

That is ­­ if ­­ if this Court were to say

24

those four sentences, district courts would have a lot

25

of guidance.

And if this Court were to say, Fogerty,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17

too, actually does it right ­­ it didn't just consider

2

litigation incentives on one side.

3

litigation incentives for the plaintiffs.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

about granting fees if there's some ­­ some

That's an

11

On the other hand, there's something that's

12

commendable about applying the law consistently,

13

routinely in regular cases.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That advances the law.
Of ­­ of course, it does.

15

And ­­ and in the right case, that can support a fees

16

something that's going to undermine the Act, as opposed

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a case, I submit, where the lower

16

courts did everything right.

17

in copyright cases for more than a century, the district

18

court focused first on the question of whether or not

19

the losing party, here Wiley, had ­­ had taken an

20

unreasonable litigation position on the law or on the

21

facts, and concluded that it obviously had not.

22

In the Ninth Circuit, prevailing defendants have

That's a huge difference.
If I look at what's happening with

you want.

plaintiffs in the Second Circuit includes, by the way, a

great number of default judgments where fees are both

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Having practiced in this

area, I know you're right.
MR. SMITH:

So, you know, these statistics

can be thrown around, but it is not as if defendants in

23

when they're appropriate, but what you ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

wrong incentives.

that case under Fogerty is incentivize both parties to

keep litigating so that the law can be clarified.

When you have a case where both sides

Mr. Smith, when you have

a ­­ a system, which the Second Circuit does, of saying,

look, this is the first among equal factors, and you

need something, you know, pretty exceptional to outweigh

11

this factor, if I'm a district judge and I'm thinking,

12

you know, who likes to be overruled by the Second

13

Circuit, it does seem as though it sends a pretty strong

signal to district courts that this is the key factor

15

and that they are not ­­ you know, probably not in their

16

lifetimes going to see a case in which that factor is

18

MR. SMITH:

The fact that ­­ that can

outweigh it, and has outweighed it, is litigation

20

misconduct.

rule very much like the rule that this Court enunciated

22

for ­­ for patent law, which is if the case is

But if we have two reasonable parties

MR. SMITH:

We think the Second Circuit's

would note, though, that since all of the factors here

went the same way in the judgment of the district court,

even if you decided that they shouldn't be giving

substantial weight to one factor, there wouldn't be a

But we do think that starting with the objective

people some basis for being able to figure out what's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you answer the

argument that you ­­ you referred to patent cases, but

thoughts you have about that?

11

MR. SMITH:

Part ­­ part of it is the

12

default judgments where fees are routinely awarded

13

because there is nobody there to oppose them in ­­ in

14

very small amounts.

15

But I ­­ I think the other thing is, as the

16

government points out in their brief, plaintiffs decide

17

when to bring cases, defendants don't decide when to be

18

defendants, and there are a lot of intentional

19

infringers of copyrights out there in the world that we

20

have now.

21

if plaintiffs didn't have a higher percentage of claims

22

that were reasonable, because they decide what case to

bring, and they know that they're going to be spending

money, and this is ­­ they're going to invest in this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

20

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

21
22
23
24
25

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I'd like to start by picking up on this
point that's gotten a fair bit of discussion about what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

41
1

the statistics are in the Second Circuit under the

2

Matthew Bender standard which says that objective

3

reasonableness should be given substantial weight.

4

Looking at hundreds and hundreds of cases in

5

the Second Circuit, in the district courts, I think that

6

there is a lot of discretion that one can exercise in

7

deciding whether to include cases in your count or not

8

include cases in your count, whether you include default

9

judgments, whether you include declaratory judgment

10

situations, whether you include situations where the

11

Court says as a technical matter, you can't get fees

12

because your motion was late.

13

if I were to consider it, I would go on to award or not

14

award you fees, anyway.

15

But in the alternative,

So I think that there is some ground to

16

quibble with some of the statistics, and I can tell you

17

what statistics I came up when I did this look, which

18

are a little bit different, and I think show that there

19

is not this vast disparity.

20

is in the district courts in the Second Circuit from

21

Matthew Bender on ­­ show that including default

22

judgments in the count, 77 percent of the time when

23

plaintiffs ask for fees and it was decided on the merits

24

in a reported decision, they got fees, and 53 percent of

25

the time when defendants asked for fees.

And the statistics ­­ this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

But if you drop out those default judgments,

2

which, as Mr. Smith indicated, are situations where the

3

fee motion is effectively unopposed, where I think the

4

defendant often looks very unreasonable by not having

5

shown up to defend the case, and where the fee amount is

6

quite small by necessity because not much has happened

7

in the case, then the numbers start to look more

8

similar, 59.7 percent for plaintiffs, 53 percent for

9

defendants.

10

So there is not this huge gulf between the

11

percentages of time when plaintiffs and defendants are

12

getting fees, at least by my count.

13

recognize there are different ways to do this count.

14

And so I think you have to take all of these numbers

15

with a little bit of a grain of salt.

16

And as I say, I

But I don't think any standard in the world

17

would give you equal numbers of plaintiffs and

18

defendants getting attorneys' fees.

19

The Matthew Bender test is neutral.

It's

20

even­handed on its face.

21

plaintiffs and defendants should be treated in the same

22

way.

23

being carried out properly in the Second Circuit, I

24

think the Court could emphasize that, and it wouldn't be

25

a reason to reject the Second Circuit's test.

It says very clearly that

And if the Court thought that that somehow weren't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

With respect to giving objective

2

reasonableness substantial weight, I would like to point

3

out that that is the approach that this Court took in

4

the Martin decision, which was a case about removal and

5

remand and which involved ­­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I'm sorry.

Which case?

Martin v. Franklin, which

8

was a case that involved the statute that, much like the

9

statute here, just gave broad discretion to district

10

courts without a lot of standards to guide them.

11

And what the Court said in that case is

12

discretion isn't whim.

13

treated alike, district court's discretion should be

14

guided in certain ways so that there can be

15

predictability and so that there can be ­­ that

16

principle of justice can be upheld, even in the absence

17

of expressed statutory restriction.

18

In order for like cases to be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You didn't have the

19

sort of situation you have here, where you're concerned

20

about encouraging people to move for remand or

21

discouraging people from filing for fees under remand.

22

It was ­­ the policy sort of pushed all one way in

23

Martin.

24
25

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, it's true that only

one side in Martin could get fees.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's true that ­­

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

44
1

that ­­ it's the ­­ when the case is remanded, so the

2

person has been unsuccessful in removing, that's when

3

fees are awarded.

4

But nevertheless, like any fee­shifting

5

statute, it is taking into account incentives on both

6

sides, whether you should try to remove the case,

7

whether you should move to remand the case if you're on

8

the other side.

9

because of this Court's Fogerty decision is that those

And what happens in the copyright world

10

incentives are judged as to plaintiffs and defendants

11

because both of them can get fees, but I don't think the

12

underlying policies are different.

13

In Martin, the Court wasn't looking at

14

anything that was specific to that statute, as to its

15

history, or to any policy that was specific to that

16

statute at all.

17

objective reasonableness was the touchstone.

18

it may be true that in some cases where the losing party

19

has been objectively reasonable, fees are appropriate,

20

in any event, because this is an equitable matter, and

21

we don't want to restrict the district court's

22

discretion, and it's hard to imagine every single case

23

that could possibly come up in the future.

24

equivalent to what the Second Circuit has done here.

25

But what the Court said was that
And, yes,

And that is

So it's very consistent with the approach

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45
1

that the Court has taken to other fee­shifting statutes

2

where there is broad discretion.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Smith suggested that he

4

thought the times in which the reasonableness inquiry

5

would be outweighed is if you see real litigation

6

misconduct.

7

anything else that actually is capable of outweighing

8

it?

9

Is that your sense too, or is there

MS. GOLDENBERG:

My sense is that that is

10

probably going to be the most frequent circumstance in

11

which it would be outweighed, and there are, as

12

Mr. Smith pointed out, some cases in the Second Circuit

13

like that, be the Video, Zalewski cases, where even

14

though the losing party was objectively reasonable, the

15

Court said there has been some misconduct here and so

16

awarded fees may be appropriate, or the district court

17

should go back and see if there was misconduct here.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe ­­

19

MS. GOLDENBERG:

So there are other examples

20

as well that I'd like to point out beyond that.

21

example comes from the ­­ the Sixth Circuit, and their

22

case is called WB Music and Bridgeport Music, and that

23

was a situation where plaintiffs indiscriminately

24

brought hundreds and hundreds of claims, some of which

25

were objectively reasonable, and some of which were not

Alderson Reporting Company

And one

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

objectively reasonably.

2

And what the Court said there was, yes, it's

3

true that your claim was objectively reasonable, even

4

though you didn't succeed, but you've proceeded in this

5

unreasonable fashion.

6

deterrence factor that's playing in here.

7

people to do this.

8

this in the future.

9

attorneys' fees in that situation.

10

And so there's a strong
We don't want

We want to stop people from doing
And so we're going to award

That is related, I think, to litigation

11

misconduct, but it's not exactly the same thing.

12

is a deterrence.

13

in the Fogerty footnote.

14

It's focusing on the deterrence factor

There is another example from the district

15

courts in the Second Circuit.

16

Exports.

17

that's a case where the defendant lost.

18

And it

It's a case called Tips

It's a Eastern District of New York case, and

And what the court said again was that there

19

is the deterrence factor that comes in here.

20

defendant was reasonable ­­ objectively reasonable in

21

its position in its ­­ on the facts and the law, but it

22

appears that the defendant is going to take this just as

23

a cost of doing business and keep on engaging in

24

infringing conduct about because the award of fees isn't

25

enough ­­ I'm sorry ­­ the award of damages is not

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

enough to stop it.

2

deterrence will override the fact that the losing party

3

was objectively reasonable.

4

So in that situation, again,

So I do think it ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, it ­­ is it

5

pertinent, in the government's view, whether or not the

6

party seeking fees was represented by pro bono counsel?

7

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I think it would be

8

pertinent if you were to adopt an approach like

9

Petitioner's approach where you took financial condition

10

of the parties into account.

11

that, then I think you would certainly need to look to

12

see whether somebody who appeared to be an impecunious

13

party was actually represented pro bono, was not

14

responsible for their fees.

15

If you are going to do

But I take some issue with what Petitioner's

16

counsel said, that ­­ that the financial condition of

17

the parties is something that courts look to when

18

they're deciding whether to make a fee award in the

19

first incidence.

20

circumstance where the courts look to the financial

21

condition of the parties under a fee­shifting statute to

22

decide whether to award fees on a granular level; in

23

other words, they look to the specific finances of the

24

specific party before them.

25

I'm not aware of any other

They certainly look at it when it comes time

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

to decide what the amount of a fee award should be, if

2

they've already decided that they are going to award

3

fees, and that, I think, is perfectly appropriate.

4

you'll see district courts in the Second Circuit, under

5

the Matthew Bender standard, doing exactly that.

6

And

If they have a very unreasonable pro se

7

plaintiff, for instance, they will say that a fee award

8

may still be appropriate if that party loses, but

9

perhaps the amount should be set lower, it will still be

10

a deterrent to that person, but it won't be financially

11

crushing to them.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fogerty says ­­ it adds,

13

"The need in particular circumstances to advance

14

considerations of compensation and deterrence."

15

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

It lists the reasonable

fact ­­ you know, reasonable position is one among four.

18

It says there could be others.

I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, it ­­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I ­­ I don't know.

3

It has to be consistent with the Act.

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I ­­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why are we suddenly picking

6
7

this one thing out of what could be a bunch of things?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

For a number of reasons.

8

First of all, if you look at the factors that are

9

mentioned in Fogerty, they actually, many of them,

10

center around objective reasonableness:

11

deterrence, motivation.

12

circling around this concept of objective

13

reasonableness, which, as I pointed out, is pretty

14

common to the Court's approach to other fee­shifting

15

statutes, not only in Martin, but also as Mr. Smith

16

explained, in Octane.

17

Frivolousness,

All of those are kind of

So that ­­ that's one example.

There's another example ­­ another reason,

18

though, that's very grounded in the Copyright Act

19

itself, and that is the history of the Copyright Act and

20

the ratification that Congress engaged in in 1976 when

21

it chose to readopt essentially the same language from

22

the 1909 Copyright Act as to which courts have, through

23

exercise of their discretion over many years, worn a

24

groove that said, generally, when the losing party is

25

reasonable, fees are not going to be appropriate.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50
1

That's equivalent to the Second Circuit's standard.

2

Congress had every reason to know that that

3

was the law under the existing language because Congress

4

was presented, by experts, by the register of

5

copyrights, whose job it is to advise Congress on

6

copyright policy, by the Brown Study, which was an

7

expert Copyright Office study that Congress had

8

commissioned.

9

Congress had good reason to know that it was true.

10

All these authorities said that, and so

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you were thinking of this

11

solely as a policy matter, if you didn't think that that

12

evidence was all that overwhelming, why is it that this

13

factor should be first among equals?

14

MS. GOLDENBERG:

For the ­­ I think a lot of

15

the reasons that Mr. Smith explained with respect to

16

incentives.

17

encouraging reasonable arguments, you're discouraging

18

unreasonable arguments, you're increasing the chances

19

that close cases where both sides are reasonable are

20

going to actually get litigated to their conclusion, and

21

therefore, the law of copyright will be clarified, which

22

is what this Court called for in its Fogerty decision.

23

If, on the other hand, you adopt something

When you make that factor important, you're

24

like the standard that Petitioner at least set forth in

25

his brief, where you privilege the precedent­setting

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

51
1

nature of the decision, then you have the tremendous

2

unpredictability, tremendous uncertainty, and

3

risk­averse parties are going to be deterred, and they

4

won't litigate those close cases to the end, and the law

5

will not be clarified.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

11

So Justice Ginsburg's question, which got

12

picked up through the course of the argument, I think

13

really gets to the nub of the matter.

14

language in Mr. Smith's presentation is that the Second

15

Circuit has adopted the Patent Act standard.

16

Thank you, Your Honor.

The magic

The Patent Act standard is different.

And

17

if Octane means anything, it is we read the words that

18

Congress actually wrote.

19

this Court defined in exactly the way that the

20

government and Wiley are defining this standard.

21

have to take Congress at its word that it meant

22

something different.

23

"Exceptional circumstances"

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

But it does mean

24

something different in practice because, as we were just

25

told, it's unusual.

There are not many fee awards made

52

in patent cases, much higher number in copyright cases.

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

The ­­

3

4

Second Circuit, the ­­ the district courts apply a

5

different standard from the Second Circuit standard.

6

That's why you have ­­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We have the ­­ the Second

the Second Circuit, when a defendant got fees, it's

because the plaintiff's position was illegal ­­ or was

unreasonable or the plaintiff took unreasonable

All of the studies that the government has
