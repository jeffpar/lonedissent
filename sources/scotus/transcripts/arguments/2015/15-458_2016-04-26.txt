ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

When a judge discharges a jury after it

11

reaches a verdict, the jury's service is at an end and

12

the jurors return to being ordinary members of the

13

public.

14

district court has inherent authority under Article III

15

of the Constitution to recall discharged jurors for

16

further service in the same case, here, for the purpose

17

of deliberating anew and reaching an entirely different

18

verdict.

This case presents the question whether a

19

The answer to that question is no.

The

20

established rule of common law forbade the recall of

21

discharged jurors.

22

Rules of Procedure reflect the understanding that a

23

district court's authority ends at the point of

24

discharge.

25

In numerous respects, the Federal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

I thought you had a

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

clear bright­line rule until I got to page 9 of your

2

reply brief, where you say, "A jury may remain

3

effectively undischarged despite a judge's pronouncement

4

of discharge."

5

There are cases where you agree that if the

6

judge says you're discharged, they're not really

7

discharged, and the judge can say, oh, come on back.

8

I've got something else you've got to do.

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, our rule

10

is clear.

11

authority to recall discharged jurors.

12

that we discuss at page 9 of our reply brief is the

13

question of what the definition of a discharge is.

14

what we offer ­­

15
16

It's a rule that a district court lacks the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, that's pretty

lawyerly.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

19

The question

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

20

(Laughter.)

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Saying anytime

22

you're discharged, it's over.

23

discharge in every case.

24

there are cases where the judge says you're discharged

25

but you would allow them to come back.

Now, discharge may not be

Because you recognize that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And that is simply, Mr.

2

Chief Justice, because we believe the discharge is an

3

act; it's not just a pronouncement.

4

vast majority of the lower courts have said.

5

said that a jury is discharged when, having been

6

released from service, the jurors have left the judge's

7

presence and control.

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
control.

And that's what the

Okay.

They have

Presence and

Now, that's ­­ that's the key distinction that

you have?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is what lower courts

12

have said, and we're certainly comfortable with that

13

distinction.

14

And if ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if they're

15

still ­­ if they're still in the courtroom, he can say,

16

wait, hold up.

17
18
19
20

You've got to come back and do this.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that is correct.

that is basically the line ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

What if they're in

the hall outside the courtroom?

21

23

And

The hall ­­
Nothing's happened.

They're all still there.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

The hall is outside a

judge's presence and control.

And the only cases where

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

jurors have been permitted to be recalled outside the

2

courtroom under this standard are cases where the

3

jurors, say, have gone back to the jury room.

4

think it's fair to say under those circumstances, that

5

the jurors are no longer ­­ are still within the judge's

6

presence and control.

7

And I

Certainly, we don't think that that

8

definition could be stretched to facts like this case,

9

where the jurors have not only left the courtroom, but

10

at least two of the jurors have left the immediate

11

vicinity of the courtroom.

12

record as if one of the jurors has left the courthouse

13

altogether.

14

And it appears from the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What they're worried

15

about ­­ what they're worried about with the rule about

16

discharge and then bringing them back is that the jurors

17

may have talked to somebody about the case, heard

18

something about it, had information that's going to be

19

prejudicial to the defendant that they shouldn't have

20

gotten.

21

they're right out in the hall or, you know, they're down

22

the hall, bring them back in and ask, just as the judge

23

did here, have you talked to anybody about the case?

24
25

Why doesn't it make sense to say, well, if

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

that the courts that have adopted that functional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

definition of discharge, that have looked at discharge

2

as the point at which jurors have separated or

3

dispersed, have focused on the potential for influence,

4

not the fact of influence.

5

aren't applying ­­ aren't engaging in a prejudiced

6

inquiry under the guise of defining discharge.

7

In other words, those courts

Instead, what they are saying is, in

8

essence, the point at which the jurors are no longer

9

together as a unit and, again, no longer within the

10

Court's instruction and direction is the point at which

11

they've been discharged.

12

proven in the case law to be a relatively easy line to

13

apply.

14

And I think that that has

And many of the cases on which Respondent

15

relies are cases in that category; in other words, cases

16

where courts, at the same time as they have recognized

17

the common law rule, have applied this functional

18

definition of "discharge."

19

Now, again, we think that this case plainly

20

does not fall even within that somewhat broader

21

definition, and the issue of whether the jury has been

22

discharged in this case is obviously not in dispute

23

before this Court.

24

this Court were to adhere to the common law rule, that

25

definition would be pretty easy to apply in practice,

But I do think that in practice, if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

and there aren't a lot of lower court decisions that

2

seem to have struggled with the application of that

3

decision.

And once you take those ­­

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I was just going to say that

once you take those cases away, Respondent really does

10

confirming that you're not raising a constitutional

barrier to the recall of jurors?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

consistently made the point all along that this issue

obviously implicates the underlying right to a fair

conceding?

Why don't we go back to what the Chief

prejudice?

3

Why aren't we looking for more specific

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Sotomayor, that is

4

for the simple reason that we believe this is really a

5

question about a district court's authority.

6

analyzing whether a district court ­­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in

Well, there's no

statutory bar.

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

10

there is no explicit bar in the rules.

11

considering whether a court has inherent authority under

12

Article III of the Constitution, the three

13

considerations on which this Court has relied are,

14

first, the history ­­ and we believe that, far from

15

there being a long history in Respondent's favor, that

16

the history really points decisively in our direction.

17

The Federal rules, and while it is true that the Federal

18

rules do not explicitly prohibit jury recall after

19

discharge, time and again the Federal rules indicate

20

that a court's authority is limited at the point of

21

discharge and that a court's authority after discharge

22

is constrained in various respects.

23

Federal rules also provide specific and concededly

24

adequate remedies for the defect at issue here, an

25

invalid or ambiguous verdict.

Well, that is correct, and

Alderson Reporting Company

But when you are

And critically, the

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we don't have a

2

specific rule that permits district courts to rescind

3

any order they've issued.

4

history, permitted district courts, when they think

5

they've entered an erroneous order, to just rescind it.

6

Why isn't this one of those orders?

7

But we've routinely, through

MR. SHANMUGAM:

District courts have

8

authority to be sure to rescind certain types of orders.

9

In our reply brief, we point to various examples of

10

orders that cannot be rescinded, such as a decision by a

11

district court to transfer venue, a decision by a

12

district judge to ­­

13
14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But those are

statutorily barred from happening.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I don't ­­ I don't

16

think that that's right.

17

that those orders are essentially like the order at

18

issue here, final in the relevant sense; in other words,

19

a district court's authority is at an end when a

20

district court transfers the case to another district,

21

when a judge recuses himself or herself, when a district

22

court enters final judgment over part of a case under

23

Rule 54(b), so ­­

24
25

I think that courts have said

judgment, is the ­­ the rule is everything is

5

there's no judgment that's been entered in the case.

6

Why doesn't the judge retain authority up until the

7

point where he enters ­­ where judgment is entered on

8

the jury verdict?

District

But here we haven't had

Yes, the jury was discharged, but

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And, Justice Ginsburg, all

10

of the examples to which I just pointed are orders that,

11

notwithstanding the fact that final judgment in the case

12

has not yet been entered, are nevertheless orders that

13

the entering judge cannot revoke.

14

Our submission is a quite straightforward one.

15

that the active discharge denotes the point at which a

16

district court's authority over the jury is at an end,

17

and the jury's authority over the case is at an end.

18

And so, too, here.
It is

And to finish my answer to Justice Sotomayor

19

about the Federal rules, I think it is critically

20

important here for the purposes of analyzing whether

21

there is inherent authority that there are specific and

22

conceivably adequate remedies for correcting an invalid

23

or ambiguous verdict both before a discharge and after

24

discharge.

25

So first, before a discharge, we certainly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

concede that before the jury is discharged, a district

2

court has the authority to recall a jury, and it's not

3

even recalling the jury.

4

jury and ordering the jury to engage in further

5

deliberations.

6

here, notwithstanding the fact that both the district

7

court and Respondent's counsel acknowledged that a

8

verdict of $0 would be invalid.

9

It's simply reinstructing the

That conspicuously did not take place

After discharge, there are actually two

10

remedies.

11

we certainly think that that has long been the remedy

12

for the type of defect at issue here, a verdict that is

13

contrary to the weight of the evidence, and indeed, not

14

only contrary to the weight of the evidence, but

15

contrary to any of the evidence.

16

The first is the remedy of a new trial, and

The other remedy, which I do want to focus

17

the Court's attention on, is the remedy that is provided

18

in Civil Rule 60(a).

19

enables a district court to essentially conduct a

20

streamlined proceeding to correct clerical errors and

21

oversights and omissions in a judgment.

22

other major category of cases on which Respondent

23

relies, those are cases in which there were simply

24

mistakes in the original verdict, cases where two

25

verdict forms might have been found in the record or

8

Could the judge amend the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No, for the simple reason

that I don't think you would know what a correctly

10

instructed jury would have done in that circumstance.

11

And indeed, in this case, the further complication was

12

that the jury was required not only to award the $10,000

13

in stipulated damages for past medical expenses, but

14

also to award some amount for future expenses.

15

indeed, when the jury came back, it returned a verdict

16

of $15,000.

So I don't think that that could have been

What if the jury is

I don't know, shows it to the lawyers and says, okay,

here, what is it?

24
25

The lawyer says, no, that's a three.

It's

Can the judge just stop the jury and say, well,
Is this 28 or 23?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The proper remedy in that

circumstance, Mr. Chief Justice, would be the one that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

I've just suggested, namely a proceeding under

2

Rule 60(a) of the Civil Rules.

3

proceeding, the judge has the ability to call back the

4

jurors, but not as a jury.

5

It can call back the jurors, essentially, as witnesses,

6

and the judge could subpoena the jurors if necessary,

7

and take affidavits or oral testimony from the jurors to

8

correct the verdict.

9

And in aid of that

That's the critical point.

And, again, I think that that's an answer to

10

the other significant category of cases that Respondent

11

relies on.

12

types of clerical errors, mistakes of a verdict being

13

recorded.

14

actually orally delivered in court.

15

cases, under our interpretation, are readily correctable

16

under Rule 60(a) and what does not need to be a

17

particularly complex proceeding.

18

Those are cases where you have these various

19

certain sense ­­ I don't know if I ­­ it's certainly not

a clerical error, but it is a simple error.

21

point is the judge told the jury, you have to award this

22

amount in medical expenses, and the jury didn't.

23

doesn't that fall under a different category than the,

24

you know, questions of certainly guilt or ­­ or

25

liability or no liability?

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, the

Why

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Mr. Chief Justice, I

2

think it's certainly fair to say that the error in this

3

case was an obvious one.

4

less than an hour earlier when the jury issued a note

5

asking about whether the damages had already been paid,

6

again both the district court and Respondent's counsel

7

acknowledged that if this was heading in the direction

8

of a $0 verdict, that verdict would be invalid.

9

Indeed, it was so obvious that

But I think it's critically important to

10

realize that we're not dealing with a case here where

11

the verdict is somehow facially invalid.

12

look at the verdict form, which is at Page 22A of the

are fine.

This is a case that falls into the ­­ the

weight of the evidence.

And, again, the remedy for that, both under
the Federal rule ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you mean with

22

respect to the amount they were ­­ they were obligated

to award?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is correct.

Well, with regard to the award, more generally.

Alderson Reporting Company

In

16

other words, they could not have awarded $0 as a matter

2

of law by virtue of Respondent's stipulation, and

3

that ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the only sense

­­ the only sense in which it was contrary to the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

If they had ­­

even at common law, the remedy in these circumstances

But my point is simply that

So in other words, Rule 59(b) is not some

15

newfangled invention.

16

cases prohibiting the recall of discharged jurors, going

17

all the way back to Loveday's case, the case that we

cite from the Exchequer from 1608, those cases say that

19

the remedy in these circumstances is a new trial.

20

If you go back and look at the

JUSTICE ALITO:

May I ask you about the

21

basis for the legal rule you're asking us to adopt?

22

let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that there

23

isn't any Federal rule that sheds very much light

24

directly on this question.

25

And

So then your argument seems to come down to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17
1

two points:

2

the ­­ the ­­ expressly, or maybe even by implication,

3

10

One is that there's nothing that gives

Trials would come to an

The other is based on the common law.

But

11

there were all sorts of common law procedures, and

12

procedures that continued into the 19th century, that

13

have been abandoned in modern practice.

14

So you want us to say if there was a ­­ an

15

established practice at common law, and into the ­­

16

maybe the late 19th century.

17

Federal courts today must follow that rule unless

18

there's something that gives them a dispensation.

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Trial judges today in the

So Justice Alito, we're

20

certainly not here arguing that there has to be an

21

express grant of authority in the Federal Rules.

22

certainly is true that Federal courts have brought

23

authority to structure their proceedings as they see fit

24

while the case is pending.

25

identified various specific procedures, you would find

And it

And I think if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

18
1

that they would comfortably meet the standard for

2

inherent authority.

3

And so to take the government's seemingly

4

favored example, in limine rulings by district courts,

5

district courts obviously have the inherent authority,

6

and indeed the express authority to make evidentiary

7

rulings.

8

rulings is simply incident to the exercise of that

9

authority.

10

And the question of the timing of those

Our point is simply that to the extent that

11

a court has that broader authority, it has never been

12

understood to confer the specific authority to recall

13

discharged jurors.

14

And to get back to the Federal Rules,

15

because I really don't think that this is a case where

16

the Federal Rules are silent on the issue ­­

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, before you do that,

18

what ­­ what rule should we adopt with respect to common

Our argument is simply that you have to look

of, you know, what is the affirmative source of the

authority here?

4

And this Court has never, in its inherent

sufficient justification for the exercise of inherent

authority.

So Justice Breyer, in

analyzing questions of inherent authority, this Court

really isn't much reason in terms of fairness not to do

it.

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And I'm not sure that that

14

is always going to be true.

15

the government in their briefs try to sort of set up

16

this dichotomy between technical defects in the verdict

17

on the one hand and burdensome new trials on the other.

18

I think that Respondent and

With regard to technical defects in the

19

verdict, truly technical defects, those can be

20

corrected, short of a new trial, under Rule 60(a).

21

recall of the jurors is going to be burdensome in cases

22

such as this one where the jury is being asked, not

23

simply to correct a technical defect, but to deliberate

24

anew and to reach an entirely different verdict.

25

would respectfully submit that of all of the cases in

Alderson Reporting Company

And

And I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

22
1

Respondent and the government's briefs, they would be

2

hard­pressed to identify any case that actually fits

3

that pattern where a district court is being told ­­

4

where a district court is telling a jury to go back and

5

reach an entirely different verdict.

6

With respect to the policy considerations, I

7

do think that there are policy considerations that

8

strongly support the bright­line rule that we are

9

advocating.

10
11

As we point out in our brief, fairness and

finality considerations point strongly in our direction.
And while it is certainly true the district

12

courts are able to engage in prejudice inquiries, we

13

think the risk of prejudice is particularly great in

14

this context.

15

recognize as much when the government attempts to cabin

16

its rule under the guise of the abuse­of­discretion

17

standard in various respects.

18

defects with that proposed rule in a minute.

19

And at least the government seems to

And I'll come back to the

But the only other thing that I would say

20

with regard to the policy balancing is that I think that

21

there's a very strong workability argument in support of

22

our position.

23

If you accept what I understand to be

24

Respondent's position; in other words, to confer on

25

district courts essentially an unbounded power to recall

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

discharged jurors subject only to the constraints of the

2

outer bounds of due process, courts and litigants are

3

going to have very strong incentive to pursue this

4

option to correct all sorts of errors.

5

And I think this case actually illustrates

6

the problem.

9

like this one, my co­counsel, Mr. Angle, would have had

There's a lot of back and forth in the

Well, in a case

10

no incentive to raise this issue before discharge for

11

the simple reason that the jury was last seen returning

12

a verdict that, not only did not award the minimum

13

amount, it awarded nothing at all to our shared client.

14

By contrast, in cases such as this one,

15

parties like Respondent, upon recognizing that there is

16

an obvious error with the verdict, are going to have

17

every incentive to pursue recalling the jury as an

18

alternative to a new trial, because after all, for the

19

same reasons that my co­counsel probably didn't like

20

this jury very much, Mr. Katyal's co­counsel presumably

21

thought this jury was the best jury on earth.

Alderson Reporting Company

And so in

This is just

So the idea

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

that this is going to cause all sorts of problems, only

2

in the rarest, rarest case.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I think ­­
And yet, when it

5

does come up, we have this concern that Justice Breyer

6

pointed out, that it's a big waste of money to have the

7

jury have to start ­­ I guess a new jury, right ­­ have

8

to be a new jury ­­ start all over again.

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, that that counts in our favor.

11

would freely acknowledge that this issue doesn't come up

12

all that often, though it does seem to come up with some

13

frequency in the State courts.

14

of cases cited in ­­ in the briefs going back all the

15

way to the early days of the Republic.

16

I would say is that to the extent that the Court thinks

17

this isn't a problem that comes up very often, it

18

indicates to us that it is simply not worth the candle

19

to adopt either Respondent's approach, which would

20

really create a motion to recall the jury, as an

21

alternative to the remedy that's actually provided in

22

the rules, a motion for a new trial, or the government's

23

approach, this sort of presumptive, one­hour limit.

24
25

I think we

And there are a number

But I think what

We simply don't think that there is any need
for this Court to move the line from the point of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

discharge to the point of discharge plus one hour and

2

what other ­­ whatever other limitations the government

3

wants to impose under the abuse of discretion standard,

4

particularly because a court will have the ability to

5

correct obvious defects before discharge.

6

And if this Court adopts our rule, it will,

7

if anything, create incentives for courts and litigants

8

going forward to pause for a moment at the point at

9

which the jury's verdict is returned and published

10

before discharge to determine whether there is an

11

obvious error that can be corrected, consistent with the

12

Court's power to do so prior to discharge.

13

And we freely acknowledge that if a court

14

wants to, for instance, take a short recess at that

15

point, it can do so.

16

And to the extent that the specter is given

17

of elaborate new trials in complex cases where the

18

trials have been particularly lengthy, I would

19

respectfully submit that it is precisely in those cases

20

where courts and litigants ought to have the incentive

21

to do that.

22

And the last thing I would say before

23

reserving the balance of my time for rebuttal, to get

24

back to Justice Alito's question, is that with regard to

25

the Federal Rules, we're not just pointing to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

26
1

specific rules like Rule 48 and Rule 51, the rules on

2

polling and the rules on instructing juries.

3

pointing as well to Rule 59(a)(2), which is the rule

4

that says that in nonjury trials, a court has the

5

authority upon receiving a motion for a new trial to

6

conduct further proceedings to take evidence to reach a

7

different judgment, but conspicuously does not confer

8

any such power in jury trials.

9

not an express prohibition on the recall of discharged

10

And that, to us, while

jurors, is the next best thing.

11
12

I would respectfully reserve the balance of
my time.

We're

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
As the Chief Justice and Justice Breyer have

20

indicated, under Petitioner's rule, a trial lasting a

21

week, a month, a year would have to be entirely done

22

just because one juror took one step outside one

in the Constitution or, Justice Sotomayor, actual

yours.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you've got to ­­

saying.

10

Putting aside the questioning here, which

11

troubles me in its adequacy, okay, it's not uncommon ­­

12

it was perhaps uncommon in this case for families to be

13

crying outside of courtrooms, for families to be talking

14

to each other and visibly expressing either their

15

pleasure or displeasure at what a jury did.

16

uncommon for court correction officers in the State of

New York to get very close to juries ­­ when they used

to sequester them, but even today ­­ and a corrections

So our rule is very simple and deals with

all of those things, which is that power after discharge

is parallel to the power before discharge.

things ­­

MR. KATYAL:

of the things I talked about.

MR. KATYAL:

their reply brief at page 13 admits this ­­ the jury

could have been resubmitted with this and had all of the

6

things, the juror crying, the folks crying outside.

7

of those things could have happened if the judge just

used a different word, "recessed" instead of

"discharged."

Because as this case comes to the Court ­­ and

Is that proper?

MR. KATYAL:

MR. KATYAL:

principle.

Court's inherent power cases which say it's got to be a

reasonable exercise.

14

It is not anything ­­ that anything goes,

So for the answer to that is it's a double

15

jeopardy violation; it's a double jeopardy violation and

16

the discharge has nothing to do with it.

Now, if I could go back and explain why I
think their rule is really problematic.

That's ­­ but we do make very

of this Court, which are very extreme.

Alderson Reporting Company

And so I don't

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32

think that we're here saying that you can undo anything.

2

We're saying it's got to meet the Degen and Chambers

The Chambers test is at page 49 and 50 of the

The existence of an alternative doesn't deprive inherent

Now, our concern about their rule, and,

13

again, going back to the first questions the Chief

seems as though the inquiry is roughly the same, but

12

there's no way in which the postdischarge case seems

different, which is that once you are discharged, you

just take off your juror hat psychologically, mentally,

the heart of the matter in the postdischarge context,

which is that you've just taken off your juror clothes

were on in an entirely different way.

14

You both have your historical arguments.

Justice Kagan, I do think that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. BASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

I'd like to begin by stating very simply

2

what we think the rule is, and in doing so, hopefully

3

clarify something about this case that I think generates

4

a little bit of confusion.

5

The rule we would apply is that if this is a

6

situation where before the discharge the judge could

7

have sent it back to the jury with a clarifying

8

instruction, then the mere formal pronouncement of

9

discharge does not bar the judge from doing that in a

10

situation where no actual prejudice would result.

11

The reason I said I think that relates to an

12

area of confusion in this case is that in his argument

13

up here, Petitioner's counsel has characterized this as

14

a weight of the evidence problem.

15

Petitioner or the judge understood the problem below.

16

They understood the problem as a legally impermissible

17

verdict that demonstrated that the jurors were confused

18

about the instructions, and Petitioner has not

19

contested, as this case comes to the court, that the

20

judge could have sent it back to the jury before

21

discharge.

22

well, I think it's against the weight of the evidence.

23

That would utterly be coercing a verdict.

24
25

But that's not how

I'm not sure that's true if the judge says,

So as the case comes to the court, it is
conceded that the judge could have sent it back before

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

discharge.

2

before this Court is whether the formal pronouncement of

3

discharge irrevocably barred the court from rescinding

4

the discharge and resubmitting the case.

5

The only question, as I understand it,

And for reasons we've set out in the brief,

6

we think the prejudice standard comports with how this

7

Court always thinks about jury impartiality issues.

8
9

In far more extreme circumstances, take the
foundational Remmer decision.

That was a criminal case

10

in which a juror ­­ there was an attempted bribe to a

11

juror and then the FBI investigation of that juror for

12

the attempted bribe.

13

to quit at that point because he had been bribed by the

14

defendant to ­­ excuse me ­­ to convict, because he had

15

been bribed by the defendant to convict.

16

he's been bribed.

17

that it is an actual prejudicial determination after

18

hearing, and it's within the discretion of the district

19

court, subject to abuse­of­discretion review, how to

20

remedy even that kind of problem.

21

significant problem.

22

So the juror had a huge incentive

The FBI knows

And what the Court said in Remmer is

And that's a very

And it's the same thing when, for example, a

23

judge forgets midtrial to admonish the jurors to avoid

24

outside influence, which is parallel to a situation here

25

with one caveat, which relates to Justice Kagan's

44

question earlier, in that jurors are exposed to outside

influence without an instruction.

5

13

receding from your brain in a way that it wouldn't

16

MR. BASH:

But I ­­ I don't think that's ­­

17

and I think a district court could properly take that

18

into consideration, but I don't think that's true a few

19

minutes after the discharge.

20

It's one thing to say when you get home and

21

you go back to your spouse or your friends and you say,

22

this is what we did, and they say, wow, I can't believe

23

you did that.

24

25

the juror had on.

I'd also say there's a more formal

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

2

Justice.
The rule that we are proposing to the Court

3

is a simple one.

4

law and the Federal rules, a district court lacks the

5

authority to recall discharged jurors for further

6

service in the same case, with "discharge" being defined

7

as the point at which a jury released from service

8

leaves the judge's presence and control.

9

It is that, consistent with the common

In writing an opinion in that direction, we

10

would respectfully submit that the Court should

11

reiterate the district courts have multiple available

12

remedies to cure the perceived problem here.

13

Again, we do freely concede, as Mr. Katyal

14

points out, that a district court has the authority to

15

reinstruct the jury and to order the jury to engage in

16

further deliberations prior to discharge, and that will

17

take care of many of the cases in the category of

18

obvious errors.

19

After discharge, it is true that a court has

20

the authority to recall jurors, but not for the purpose

21

of reconstituting them as a jury.

22

the purpose of correcting clerical errors and other

23

oversights in the judgment.

24

more substantial, however ­­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Instead, simply for

And where the errors are

What about ­­ what about

clerical errors?

2

pointed to deals with, clerical errors.

3

"and others," so what's the others?

4

I understand that's what the rule you

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But you said

Well, I think that the

5

others are these cases like the ones I referred to in my

6

opening argument where, you know, a jury returns two

7

verdict forms and the question is which verdict form is

8

the correct one.

9

In other words, courts have the authority to

10

deal with situations where what you're trying to do is

11

to intuit the jury's intent at the time of the original

12

verdict; to take evidence on historical facts concerning

13

what the jury actually did.

14

Rule of Evidence, Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), makes

15

clear that that is an exception to the ordinary

16

applicable rule that evidence from jury deliberations is

17

inadmissible.

18

And the relevant Federal

And of course, finally, the last available

19

remedy is to order a new trial.

20

characterize the error at issue here, whether you

21

characterize it as a verdict that's contrary to the

22

weight of the evidence or an instructional error, a new

23

trial has always been the default remedy in those

24

circumstances.

25

And again, however you

I think that the problem with Respondent and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

51
1

the government's rule was well pointed out in Mr. Bash's

2

argument.

3

is prejudice, the government's limitations ­­ proposed

4

limitations really don't make a lot of sense, and

5

neither does Respondent's suggestion made for the first

6

time at oral argument today that there is a limitation

7

on the time period in which juries can be recalled.

8
9

To the extent that the driving concern here

And that is for the simple reason that you
can have a jury that's been out for a long period of

10

time where you don't have prejudice, and conversely you

11

can have prejudice almost instantly, particularly in the

12

world of smart phone communications.

13

this Court articulates here is going to apply in civil

14

and criminal cases alike.

15

And the rule that

And Justice Ginsburg, the final judgment

16

limitation really provides little solace in the criminal

17

context because when a jury returns a verdict, final

18

judgment is typically not entered until after

19

sentencing, which again typically takes place sometime

20

later.

21

And at bottom ­­ or the question in this

22

case is really whether extending a court's power beyond

23

the point of discharge is worth the candle.

24

in light of all the available alternatives in this

25

situation, we would respectfully submit that it is not,

Alderson Reporting Company
