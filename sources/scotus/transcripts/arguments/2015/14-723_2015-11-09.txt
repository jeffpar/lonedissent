We'll hear argument

Mr. Stris.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. STRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

In this ERISA case, a fiduciary has sued a

13

beneficiary to establish and enforce an equitable lien

14

by agreement.

15

As this Court has repeatedly acknowledged,

16

an equitable lien is enforceable only against specific

17

property and its traceable product in the defendant's

18

possession.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stris, there's some

20

fuzziness about the facts in this case, and maybe at the

21

outset you can clarify them.

22

Different figures are given about how much

23

money from this settlement was actually delivered to

24

your client.

25

Did he put it with his general assets, or did he keep it

And also, what did your client do with it?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

in a separate fund?

2
3

Maybe you can start by answering those
questions.

4

MR. STRIS:

5

So I ­­ I want to start with what's in the

6

record, and then I want to add some color that I think

7

will provide context.

8
9

So as far as what's in the record, there was
a genuine issue of ­­ of material fact on how much

10

dissipation there was.

11

record is that ­­

12
13

I think I can, Justice Ginsburg.

One thing that's clear from the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Before we get to

dissipation, how much did he receive?

14

MR. STRIS:

Yes.

So that's clear, he

15

received over time, after all expenses were out, about

16

$200,000.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. STRIS:

19
20

200.

I think that's clear from the

record.
What's also clear procedurally ­­ and this

21

is important, and this is Page 64 of the Joint

22

Appendix ­­ is that he took the position in opposing

23

summary judgment that he has very little of the money

24

remaining, and he cited a declaration and an attached

25

sheet that I admit are confusing.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And ­­ and this $200,000,

2

did he put it in a general account or was it set aside

3

in a specific account?

4

MR. STRIS:

It is nothing in the record to

5

indicate that, but I think as far as the rules work, it

6

wouldn't matter because the rules for equitable lien by

7

agreement, the tracing rules, are actually very robust,

11

balance rule" developed to prevent against precisely the

12

kind of mischief that we would reasonably worry about.

13

Something called the "lowest intermediate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mr. Stris, it does

14

make a difference, because if he just put it, say, in

15

the bank account where he had all of his other money,

16

then how ­­ how could we say that he spent all of the

17

proceeds on childcare and living expenses?

18

one mixed pot, how can we say, oh, yes, this came from

19

the settlement and not from his general funds?

20

MR. STRIS:

If you have

It's a very fair question,

21

Justice Ginsburg.

22

tracing rules at equity, and it worked as follows:

And there ­­ there are settled

23

If you took money and it was cash and you

24

put it in a bank account, what was presumed was that,

25

unless your total cash assets dipped below the amount

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

that you got, that the spending that you did was not out

2

of that, the creditor's rights were not impaired.

3

So the only way we would prevail on

4

remand ­­ I want to be clear about the modesty of the

5

position that we're taking here.

6

prevail on remand is if he got the money and he spent it

7

down ­­ all of his money, not just the settlement but

8

all of the cash that he had ­­ down below the ­­ the

9

amount of the settlement.

The only way we would

10

That's why this is very important.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what ­­
Well, I ­­ I don't

13

know if it's the right Latin phrase or ­­ "pro tanto" or

14

something.

15

16

left would be subject to tracing.

17

I mean, you would lose ­­ it ­­ it ­­ it

MR. STRIS:

Whatever is

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

18

correct.

19

is a big difference between the way equity worked, which

20

was to have a sensible rule below its intermediate

21

balance, and what I view as the extreme swollen asset

22

theory, that never was applied at equity, that my friend

23

Mr. Katyal is advocating.

But the point I was trying to make is, there

24

Under the swollen asset theory, if you get

25

new money in the future, if you spend below the lowest

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

intermediate balance but then you start earning income,

2

people can come and garnish your wages.

3

point that I'm making here is that the equity

5

than one would think if one read the briefs of the other

6

side.

14

promise­breaking by beneficiaries.

And that happens.

15

And those are legitimate concerns.

But from where I'm

16

sitting, I see a lot of cases where there's

17

promise­breaking by fiduciaries, where they take a

18

reimbursement provision that's preempted in an insured

19

plan and then try and enforce it, or where they try and

20

enforce a provision that doesn't apply by its own terms.

So I mean, you know ­­ I think that's another

of, is this a sensible rule that is consistent with the

But if you have a case where there is

10

outright fraud ­­ and I've seen these, where a

participant receives money because they claim that

12

says, you know, I'm going to get one over on the Plan,

and I'm going to keep this money, and I'm going to spend

disaster if there's a present possession requirement.

What sense does

So that's a fair point,

17

I would say is that I think a fair­minded policymaker

18

19

I'm not going to get up here and tell you that it's the

20

rule that I would pick, but I think a fair­minded

policymaker could ­­ and particularly, Justice Alito,

22

when you appreciate that it's a rule that's going to

apply to all cases, not just subrogation.

case for this as a policy matter becomes much stronger

25

in the pension context.

Alderson Reporting Company

What

I think the

18

The reason I make that point is I know that

2

I'm running up against this counterintuitive view that

3

how can our ­­ how can our position, even if it's what

4

the cases say, even if the unbroken line of history

5

means this, how can it not be totally at odds with

6

the ­­ the core purpose of ERISA?

7

It may not be the better policy in your view, but it's

8

certainly one that is consistent with the spirit of

9

ERISA, and so the decision that needs to be made is:

And I think it's not.

10

What is this line of cases that this Court has decided?

11

What did they say?

12

And I think repeatedly from Great­West to

13

Sereboff, you reiterated in CIGNA that in nonfiduciary

14

cases, a lien is not equitable relief unless it's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3
4
5
6

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If I could just start with Justice Alito's

7

question about what ­­ what sense this framework makes,

8

in limiting available relief to equitable relief in

9

ERISA, Congress, I think, contemplated that there

10

wouldn't be a remedy for plan breaches in every case.

11

And so the framework this Court developed was to

12

distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and

13

things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn't mean

14

to include in the relief that would be available.

15

And so ­­ I think it's been true since

16

Great­West when this Court interpreted equitable relief

17

pretty narrowly that a beneficiary will have an

18

incentive in some cases to structure a settlement in

19

order to avoid paying reimbursement to the Plan.

20

it's also been true since Great­West that because of

21

that, plans have a need to counter those incentives by

22

diligently protecting their rights.

23

But

And so I think the way that the Court rules

24

in this case is not going to affect the existence of

25

those incentives on the part of beneficiaries or the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

need for plans to be diligent.

2

important to keep in mind here that the only reason this

3

issue comes up in this case is that the Plan wasn't

4

diligent, that the Plan waited for months when it knew

5

that it had a reimbursement claim, and that that was

6

being disputed.

7

didn't file suit.

8
9

So I think it's

It didn't seek an injunction.

It

So yes, I think this is a situation that is
unlike the mine run of cases where we see that plans

10

since Great­West have developed measures that they can

11

take in order to protect their rights.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Anders, in

13

Great­West, the government filed on the side of the

14

Plan.

15

What led the government to shift its position?
MS. ANDERS:

I think in Great­West, I think

16

we were taking a somewhat broader view of equitable

17

relief than the court ended up adopting in that case.

18

And so as we get here today, we've taken this position

19

because we think it is absolutely the logical

20

consequence of Great­West and Sereboff together.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you took your position

because of Great­West?
MS. ANDERS:

That's absolutely right.

In

24

Great­West, the Court said that when the funds are not

25

in the beneficiary's possession, the Plan cannot enforce

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

an equitable lien ­­ cannot get equitable relief against

2

the Plan.

3

said, quoting, "If the property or its proceeds have

4

been dissipated so that no product remains, the

5

plaintiffs may not enforce a constructive trust or

6

equitable" ­­

And it relied on equitable authorities that

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Probably what ­­
You thought ­­ you

thought ­­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.
But you thought

12

Great­West adopted a ­­ a narrower understanding of what

13

equitable meant in this context than you thought was

14

appropriate.

15

MS. ANDERS:

I think at the time we were

16

arguing for a broader understanding.

17

come here today, of course, nobody has ­­ has argued

18

that Great­West or Sereboff should be overturned, or

19

Mertens, for that matter.

20

consequence of those two decisions is that there will

21

not be relief in a case in which the Plan participant

22

has dissipated the funds.

23

But as we ­­ as we

And so we think the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But would you ­­ say,

24

what is the government's position on commingling?

25

There's no ­­ the beneficiary gets the check, puts it in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

his bank account, together with whatever else he has in

2

there.

3

So how do we tell if he's dissipated?
MS. ANDERS:

I agree with my friend that the

4

commingling rule at equity, I think, reflected the fact

5

that once funds have been dissipated, the lienholder can

6

no longer collect.

7

had funds in your account that ­­ and you spent them,

8

that at first it would be presumed that you were

9

spending your own money.

10

So the way it worked was that if you

But ­­ but once you got down below the

11

amount that ­­ that was originally subject to the lien,

12

the lienholder would only be able to enforce against

13

whatever remained in that account even if it wasn't

14

sufficient to satisfy the lien amount.

15
16
17

So it's basically the same dissipation rule
that applies in cases that don't involve commingling.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Why can't ­­ in a case

18

where there's no time problem ­­ forget the delays and

19

so forth ­­ but like this one, the Plan sue the lawyer?

20

I mean, if there was $500,000 and the lawyer received

21

200,000 ­­ but he certainly received it with notice.

22

It's not any kind of good­faith purchaser ­­ why can't

23

they get it back from him?

24
25

MS. ANDERS:

I think there may be situations

in which the Plan could sue the lawyer.

in my situation?

3

MS. ANDERS:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think they probably could.
All right.

If they could,

5

then doesn't that solve the problem for them because

6

lawyers will be awfully careful not to dissipate the

7

funds if, in fact, they're going to be subject to the

8

lawsuit?

9

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think that's right, and

10

I think lawyers also have ethical rules that ­­ that

11

prevent them from ­­ from dissipating funds ­­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

if they can get it from the lawyer immediately, why

can't they get it from the lawyer at ­­ at the end of

the day?

receives, but also what he has paid his lawyer?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't see why it would

be.

17

The lawyer knows it belongs to person X.

18

the lawyer takes $200,000 out of the money that belongs

19

to person X and gives 300,000 to the client.

There is a fund.

20

The fund belongs to person X.
Nonetheless,

I assume the client is more likely to spend

21

money down than the lawyer, because lawyers tend, in

22

general, to have a larger bank account than poorer

23

clients.

sue the lawyer.

But ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All ­­ all of those

things you say ­­ all of those things you say the Plan

2

you get into ­­ we've noted before that we try to avoid

3

complicating the procedures in this area, for the simple

4

reason that nobody has to set up one of these plans.

5

And if they don't know, you know, how much it's going to

6

cost in advance and all of them just say, well, it's not

7

worth it, and if I've got to go and file injunctions or

8

this or that every time somebody makes a ­­ has a tort

9

recovery, you know ­­ but I'm not going to do it.

10

And when

I

won't set up one of these plans.

11

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think ­­ I think an

12

important point, Your Honor, is that no matter how the

13

Court rules here, the Plans are going to have those

14

obligations and they're going to have those burdens,

15

because Great­West permits beneficiaries to structure

16

their settlements to avoid paying reimbursement to the

17

Plan.

18

So because of that, ever since Great­West,

19

Plans have taken these measures and ­­ and they will

20

continue to take them even if the Court rules for

21

Respondents.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What are the concerns on

23

the other side, which you have mentioned and ­­ and

24

which your ­­ your friend also mentioned?

25

they?

Alderson Reporting Company

What are

Official

28
1

MS. ANDERS:

So one concern, as you said, is

2

that ­­ that whatever rule the Court announces, it's

3

going to apply in the pension and disability benefit

4

context too.

5

making overpayments to beneficiaries over a long period

6

of time.

7

without knowing that she's going to be responsible for

8

reimbursing it later, or ­­ or that it's not her money

9

to spend in a sense.

And in that situation, the Plan may be

And the beneficiary may spend the money

And so in that situation, I think

10

a policymaker could be concerned that ­­ about a plan

11

being able to go ­­ go back months or years later and ­­

12

and get reimbursement from the beneficiary.

13

So I think, you know, this is really a

14

question for Congress.

15

could weigh that potential against the downside to the

16

Plan, the fact that, since Great­West, they have ­­ they

17

have had these obligations, they have needed to

18

diligently protect their rights, and, I think, in the

19

mine­run of cases, they've been able to do so.

20

But what Congress could do is it

So I think those are the things that

21

Congress could weigh in looking at the policy ­­ policy

22

concerns on either side of this.

23
24
25

And that's why we think those concerns
really shouldn't drive the analysis here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Anders, could I ­­ could

The

What does it mean?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

20

Three things are undisputed.

21

First, that Montanile signed a form saying,

22

quote, "I agree to reimburse in full the Plan from any

23

settlement."

24
25

Second, the Plan provides that such funds
are, quote, "Assets of the Plan not distributable to any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

person without the Plan's written release."

2

And third, under Sereboff, that the Plan

3

would have an enforcement claim under 502(a)(3) if

4

Montanile still possessed the funds.

5

What we're disagreeing about is whether

6

Montanile's decision to commit a second wrong of

7

spending the Plan's money himself has made him

8

judgment­proof.

9

reason:

And the answer is no for a very simple

When a right under equity has attached and a

10

defendant then knowingly frustrates that equitable

11

claim, it is absolutely part of equity to permit that

12

claim.

13

defendant took actions that blocked an otherwise valid

14

claim in equity.

15

This reflects the cold reality that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ I have no idea

16

where you think this lien attached.

17

attached at the fund, immediate ­­ the whole 500,000, or

18

the amount of that 500,000 that ended up in his pocket,

19

or that 500,000 minus what, if anything?

20

MR. KATYAL:

Do you think it

So it ­­ it's ­­ Barnes says

that the ­­ that the lien attaches at the moment that he

is ­­ that he has gotten title to the thing.

title to the thing when there is a $500,000 settlement.

25

that he nonetheless did.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your position is at

3

that moment it goes to the lawyer, it's his money, all

4

500,000.

5
6

You're entitled to whatever ­­
MR. KATYAL:

To a ­­ to a lien of $121,000

on it.

7

And so our claim is not that we have some

8

general remedy at law that we can get compensatory

9

consequential damages or punitive damages.

10

It's limited

by the lien itself.

11

And that is the rule in equity, that when

12

someone frustrates a valid claim in equity by taking

13

actions to dissipate the fund, you can get ­­

14

recover the value of that fund.

15

than that.

16

when ­­ when you make an equitable claim like this, you

17

have to be limited by all the rules of equity.

18

You can't recover more

So this is the bitter with the sweet that

So in addition to that, Justice Sotomayor,

19

we couldn't, for example, try and attach the asset, try

20

and attach and file a lawsuit, until he actually took

21

possession of the funds.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I ­­ I found a list.

On

23

this list I have, one, there is the fund, 500,000 in it.

24

It belongs to the company, not to him.

25

Now, he takes the fund and he begins to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

distribute it with the aid of his lawyer.

2

money goes to the lawyer.

3

I imagine you could get it.

4

Some of the

If that money is still there,

Some of the lawyer's goes to his bank

5

account.

6

from the time he put it there to the time you sue, below

7

$121,000, you can get it.

8

below, you can still get it even if there's a penny, but

9

you can only get the penny.

If, in fact, that bank account has not gone,

Indeed ­­ and if it has gone

10

If he has taken the 121,000 out of it and

11

given it to a person with knowledge, for example, his

12

wife or children, and it is in their bank account, I

13

guess you could get it.

14

And indeed, if they have got and bought with

15

it some tangible item that you can trace it to, I guess

16

you can get it.

17

But what we could not find and, in fact, if

18

you can't find any of those, you could still sue him

19

under State law, under State fraud statutes, and recover

20

in damages.

21

even under such a remedy where it's much more mixed up

22

than the other side was prepared to give you credit for,

23

in which case, you have State law remedies at law.

24
25

That's at law.

And maybe you can do it

Now, what I could not find is a case
embodying the theory you are now advancing, that he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

simply gets the damages even where he doesn't have any

2

of the remedies that I just mentioned.

3

MR. KATYAL:

So ­­ so first of all, we're

4

not advancing that theory, Justice Breyer.

5

get ­­ we're not advancing a damages theory whatsoever.

6

All we're saying is that you can recover the value of

7

the lien itself when someone frustrates an equitable

8

claim that otherwise exists.

9

You cannot

And we point to three different traditions

10

in equity that permit you to do that:

11

monetary decrees, deficiency judgments, and swollen

12

assets.

13

someone shouldn't profit from their second wrong, their

14

wrongdoing of dissipating a fund.

15

substitutionary

All of those reflect the basic idea that

18

an urban legend that ­­ that I think the briefs try and

19

spin around that rule, to say that that general rule

20

encompasses a situation when someone acts wrongfully to

21

dissipate a fund, as to which someone has a claim.

22

The general rule is that you can't recover from
That is absolutely right.

But there's

And that circumstance, Justice Holmes's

Here as

this case comes to the Court, everyone agrees ­­ that's

6

the third point I made at the outset ­­ everyone agrees

there was an equitable lien by agreement.

8

thing we're disagreeing about is whether or not by

And with respect to that question, they have

11

general precedents which say you can't go after general

when someone has wrong ­­ when ­­ when ­­ when a valid

9

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, this is,

10

again, part of the urban legend that ­­ that's being

11

developed around this.

12

a substitutionary monetary decree is a legal judgment or

13

is ancillary.

14

such as Baxter and Otis suggest that it is an equity not

15

in that.

16

this, I ­­ I suggest that you'd have to say it's equity,

17

because the tradition for ancillary, which was pendent

18

jurisdiction was, if an equity court was going to decide

19

a legal claim, they had to label it as a legal claim

20

because of the Seventh Amendment reasons, because

21

otherwise, they might, you know, there's ­­ there's all

sorts of jury trial issues that come up.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm still a little bit

4

confused by all of this.

In my mind, you get money when

5

somebody gives it to you.

And I ­­ I know that a lawyer

6

is an agent, but the agent is keeping a piece of the

7

money.

8

the lawyer took?

9

You can still go after the client for the piece

MR. KATYAL:

So with ­­ with respect to

10

the ­­ the lawyer piece is much more complicated.

11

this goes to Justice Breyer's question.

12

actually a circuit split on this question about can you

13

go after the lawyer, and the reason why you may not be

14

able to go after the lawyer is the lawyer is not a party

15

to the underlying agreement.

16

And

I mean, there's

And that's what I think the Eighth Circuit

17

says in contradistinction to others.

18

that ­­ that it is ­­ that is not a great remedy.

19

of course, it requires the lawyer to be on notice of the

20

Plan and all the reimbursement obligations and the like.

21

Under equity, Justice Sotomayor, I think the

22

idea is that when someone has made a valid promise to ­­

23

for these funds, such as here, Montanile knew that he

24

was playing with house money.

25

weren't his ­­ this wasn't his money; it was the Plan's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you say again, when

10

does the lien attach?

beneficiary actually gets the 200,000?

Is it when the tortfeasor pays ­­

MR. KATYAL:

Well ­­ well, even if you can

14

make that argument about deficiency judgments, which

15

I'll respond to in a moment, you can't make it about

16

substitution or monetary decrees, which is a distinct

17

body in equity.

18

And with respect to that, in 1864,

19

absolutely.

20

which allowed for deficiency judgments.

21

fact that they had to issue a rule doesn't somehow make

22

it a law claim, as my friend says.

23

Rule 73, promulgated in 1864, was a rule about

24

preliminary injunctions.

25

preliminary injunctions were available in equity, and,

This Court promulgated Equity Rule 92,
But I think the

I mean, after all,

And I certainly think

Alderson Reporting Company

you know, the fact that there was a rule about it didn't

2

somehow convert it into a law claim.

3

So I think the very fact that this Court

4

issued a rule called Equity Rule 10 is suggestive of the

5

­­ of the fact that this is a tradition in equity.

6

Now, look, if there's some doubt about this,

7

if there's some doubt on the traditions, and they've

8

got ­­ I don't think they have a single case, but even

9

if you thought they did, that said that we were

10

prohibited ­­ that we were prohibited from making these

11

claims at equity, I think you should err on the side of

12

recognizing the claim.

13

Why?

For three reasons.

One, because as

14

the Solicitor General's brief in Sereboff said, the

15

point of ERISA is to try and give effect to written

16

plans and their determinations.

17

into the ­­ as to what the equity tradition is, you

18

should read it in light of trying to enforce Plan terms.

19

That is the pages 23 and 24 of their brief.

20

consistent with the way this Court approaches, for

21

example, Title VII cases and the like.

22

And if there's doubt

It is

The second is that, again, all we're seeking

23

here is a remedy.

24

what would have been otherwise available at equity.

25

Our ­­ our view is that when someone frustrates an

3

second wrongdoing.

4

what equity is all about.

5

You can't get more from it because of their
So I think we're giving effect to

And then, third ­­ and this goes back to

6

your last question to Ms. Anders, you said, you know,

7

what was ­­ what was the ­­ what does "typically

8

available at equity" mean?

9

comes from Mertens.

And you know, that test

Mertens isolates three examples of

10

what was traditionally available as equity ­­ at equity:

11

mandamus, injunction, and restitution.

12

Now, if you look at mandamus, for example,

13

there are precedents from this Court making ­­ that ­­

that suggest that equity ­­ that equity didn't recognize

You know, this Court twice in the nineteenth

And I think that's a good textual clue that

19

when there's doubt as to whether something is actually

20

traditionally available at equity or not, you should err

21

on the side of recognizing it as traditionally

22

available, as this Court did in the foundational Mertens

23

test.

24
25

We're not quibbling with Mertens.

We're

simply saying we're at least as strong as to whether

something was traditionally available at equity as

its three examples.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. STRIS:

12

I'd just like to make two brief points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

first one is that the historical authorities are

14

unquestionably on our side.

15

hearing my ­­ my friend Mr. Katyal go straight to the

16

substitutionary monetary remedy.

17

things about this:

18

The

And it was interesting

I want to say a couple

First, if you look carefully, the exact

19

argument he's making was rejected by the holding of this

20

Court in Great­West.

21

Court's opinion.

22

the opinion.

23

This is Section II C of the

It's kind of a lesser­known part of

The ­­ the argument was made that a

24

beneficiary of a trust commits that second wrong that he

25

was talking about when they get a loan contractually and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56

2

that's not typically available in equity.

3

know, it's precisely the distinction that he's trying to

4

now push upon you to squeeze this remedy through.

5
6

And what this Court said is, no,
And, you

So let's look at the substitutionary
monetary decree cases he talks about.

7

Not a single one of them involves an

8

equitable lien by agreement.

9

an agreement.

They ­­ they don't involve

They're restitutionary cases.

So that's

10

also interesting to me that he criticizes our side

11

talking about the ­­ the Restatement of Restitution,

12

Section 215, whereas we talk about Pomeroy.

13

about Jones on liens.

14

It's an 1880 case on page 35 of the Blue brief.

15

equitable lien by agreement case.

16
17
18

We talk about the Person case.
It's an

The historical authority here is beyond
dispute.
And ­­ and I guess the last thing I'll say

19

on this is look at the Shafer's Appeal case.

20

of his lead cases on page 37, note 6.

21

substitutionary monetary relief is legal.

22

We talk

It's one

It says that

So I ­­ I think if you look at the cases,

23

not that I would wish that upon anyone, they ­­ they

24

really do not even credibly support the proposition

25

historically.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

So where does that leave us?

I mean, I

2

think I was honest from minute one when I got up here.

3

The only reason that you would contort the standard that

4

you've developed ­­ let's be honest; you know, spot me

5

this ­­ you have to believe our position is

6

fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of ERISA.

7

If you do, then I have a problem.

8
9

But here's where we're at.

Mr. Chief

Justice, you made a very strong policy argument about

10

why my rule is no good.

11

make a very strong policy argument about why

12

participants who prove a clear bad­faith breach by a

13

plan should get consequential damages.

14

that argument.

15

persuasively.

16

We're here to apply the historical test.

17

With respect, I think I could

I could make

I think I could make it very
But that's not what we're here to do.

So let's end, essentially, with, I think, a

18

key concession that Mr. Katyal makes about the

19

disability context.

20

So if you look at this case and you say,

21

well, all this subrogation, I don't know.

22

arguments that the Plans have ways to protect

23

themselves, maybe they're right, but maybe they're

24

onerous.

25

to add to the cost of plans.

These

And, you know, I'm just not sure if it's going

Alderson Reporting Company

Go look at the disability cases.

Because I

2

was stunned when Mr. Katyal got up here and said, oh,

3

well, the disability cases are different, like this

4

doesn't extend to them.

5

respect with this Court in the Bilyeu case, which was

6

one of the circuit split cases that's here.

7

circuit split cases involve the disability context.

8
9

He filed a cert petition with

So I'll end with this:
you?

Half of the

What does that tell

The fact that you look at these disability cases

10

and you see that money is being advanced and it's being

11

spent before the lien even attaches, and yet they're

12

made part of the circuit split, and in this case

13

Respondent is not willing to defend that as a policy

14

position, I think what it tells you is that fair­minded

15

people could disagree as to where you want to place the

16

risk.

17

And so when we go and look at this and we

18

think about it in terms of burdens, if there is any

19

reasonable position, as you look at this, that a rule

20

that says you can essentially go after general assets,

21

means that some meaningful number of fiduciaries will

22

abuse that to assert rights they don't have or to delay,

23

then I think you need to go with the clear line of

24

historical authorities.

confined to subrogation cases.

MR. STRIS:

No.

We have a circuit split which led to the

Court granting this case, and all of the cases purport

13

to resolve the same question presented.

are in the subrogation context; half of them are in the

disability context.
