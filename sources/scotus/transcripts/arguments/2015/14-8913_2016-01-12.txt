CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 14­8913, Molina­Martinez v.

5

United States.

Mr. Crooks.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. CROOKS:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

As this Court recognized in Peugh v.

12

United States, the United States Sentencing Guidelines

13

remain uniquely central to Federal sentencing even where

14

the district court ultimately chooses to sentence

15

outside the Guidelines.

16

Because of the strong anchoring effect of

17

the Guidelines, as also recognized in Peugh, the natural

18

effect of an erroneously high Guideline range is to skew

19

a defendant's sentence higher than it would have been

20

under the correct range.

21

has elected to sentence within what it believes to be

22

the correct range, it is typically very difficult to

23

determine what the district court would have done had it

24

been presented with the correct lower range.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yet when the district court

Mr. Crooks, you didn't

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

cite 18 U.S.C. 3742(f), and I wondered why, because it

2

reads:

3

sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect

4

application of the Sentencing Guidelines, the court

5

shall remand the case for further sentencing proceedings

6

with such instructions as the court considers

7

appropriate."

8
9
10
11

"If the court of appeals determines that the

So this seems to say that, if the
incorrect ­­ there was an incorrect application of the
Guidelines, then a remand is mandatory.
MR. CROOKS:

It ­­ it does appear to say

12

that, Justice Ginsburg; however, I believe in this

13

Court's decision in Williams v. United States, the Court

14

said that Guideline errors are nonetheless subject to

15

the normal doctrines of harmless and plain­error review

16

and not subject to automatic reversal.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And ­­ and so it's not

18

clear that there was a Guidelines violation here.

19

Guidelines were incorrectly calculated, but it's not

20

clear that at the end of the day there was a violation.

21
22
23

The

I mean, is that really your response to
Justice Ginsburg, or am I oversimplifying?
MR. CROOKS:

There was a misapplication of

24

the Guidelines, but harmless and plain­error doctrines

25

apply to determine the remedy for that violation or

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5

2

misapplication.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, there was a

3

miscalculation.

I'm not sure if there was a

4

misapplication.

That's ­­ I ­­ I suppose that's the

5

issue in the case.

Or ­­ or is this ­­

6

MR. CROOKS:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. CROOKS:

9

We believe ­­
­­ is this quibble wrong?
We believe that there was a

misapplication because the Guidelines were incorrectly

10

calculated with respect to the defendant's criminal

11

history.

12

Justice Ginsburg was referring to says you should remand

13

for, subject, of course, as this Court says in Williams,

14

to the normal doctrines of harmless and plain error.

15

And that is the type of thing that the statute

And we're here today, of course, on a

16

plain­error case because we have a Guideline

17

misapplication that unfortunately was not discovered by

18

anyone below.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you say that when

20

there is a ­­ excuse me ­­ a miscalculation of the

21

Guidelines range, that should give rise to a rebuttable

22

presumption that the miscalculation affected the

23

sentence that the judge imposed.

24

MR. CROOKS:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's correct, Justice Alito.
And what does that mean?

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

Does that mean that the ­­ the burden of persuasion

2

shifts to the prosecution?

3

MR. CROOKS:

We believe that the Court's

4

opinion in Olano actually supports a conceptualization

5

that it simply gives the defendant an alternative way to

6

satisfy his burden of persuasion, which is done in a

7

generalized rather than a case­specific way.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose there's no

evidence, as ­­ as will ­­ may very often be the case.

10

Suppose the judge says ­­ imposes a sentence within what

11

the judge believes to be the Guideline range but says

12

nothing whatsoever beyond that, and it turns out that

13

that is not the correct Guidelines range, so that

14

there's no evidence one way or the other about what the

15

judge would have done had the judge understood the

16

correct Guidelines range.

17

What outcome in that situation?

18

MR. CROOKS:

In that situation, typically

19

the result would be that the third prong of plain­error

20

review would be satisfied and the defendant would have

21

shown an effect on his substantial right.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that means that the

23

burden of persuasion in that situation is on the

24

prosecution.

25

MR. CROOKS:

Again, we may be quibbling

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

about terms, but we believe that the defendant satisfies

2

his burden of persuasion with generalized evidence

3

tending to show the ­­ that the natural effect of a

4

Guideline error is to affect the sentence.

13

Would we ­­ you draw a general inference

14

that the corrected Guideline would have made any

15

difference on that sentence?

MR. CROOKS:

We would, Your Honor.

position is that anytime the range is not the correct

range, there should be a presumption that it affected ­­

MR. CROOKS:

14

been committed of a crime, that the judge might take

that into consideration, even in an overlapping

16

Guideline case, and send it back.

how much mercy that judge might have shown.

Honor, in this case, despite Mr. Molina­Martinez's

natural pull of the Guidelines is so strong, so

12

Would there be a presumption of nonharmlessness?

MR. CROOKS:

I believe under Rule 52(a)

13

there is in effect a presumption of nonharmlessness that

14

the government must rebut.

15

that the error was harmless.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To show that the error was

Is that the proper way to think of this case

in your view?

continues with what Justice Alito was inquiring:

need to use the word "presumption" here?

5

Another way of asking the question is ­­

MR. CROOKS:

Do we

I don't think the word

6

"presumption" is absolutely necessary.

7

that the Court used in Olano, but I think it ­­ it's

8

really viewed more as who bears the risk of

9

nonpersuasion.

It is the word

And what we're asking is that in the

10

very limited context of a Guideline­range error, the

11

defendant should be deemed to have carried his burden by

12

the generalized evidence that this Court recognized in

13

Peugh v. United States, that the Guidelines do affect

14

sentences and that Guideline ranges do affect what the

15

district court does.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where have we done that

17

before?

18

Olano, which said that there may be a special category.

19

There may be a special category of forfeited errors that

20

can be corrected, regardless of their effect on the

outcome.

category in the past.

MR. CROOKS:

Well, the lower courts ­­ this

2

Court has not found a presumption since Olano, but the

3

Court did give careful consideration to whether a

4

presumption should apply to the particular type of error

5

at issue in Olano.

6

But more importantly, the lower courts have

7

looked to what this Court said in Olano, and in a tiny

8

handful of ­­ of errors, they have adopted just such a

9

rebuttal.

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's more important?

That the lower courts have established the law for us?

12

MR. CROOKS:

bind the Court, but they are expressive of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Who needs the word "presumption"?

MR. CROOKS:

We agree, Justice Kagan.

Unfortunately, the Fifth Circuit did not, so.

11

But we do believe that ­­ that however you

12

conceptualize it, the draw, the pull of the Guidelines

13

is because of the unique centrality of the Guidelines

14

sufficient to establish the reasonable probability of a

15

different result.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What good does it do to say

17

that the Guidelines are advisory, which is what we have

held, if, when you mistake them or when you don't apply

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your argument has some

3

appeal on the facts of this case because the judge

4

sentenced the defendant to a sentence at the bottom of

5

what the judge understood to be the Guideline range.

6

But would your argument apply to any sentence that was

7

within both the original and the correct Guideline

8

range?

9

Suppose the judge here had sentenced your

10

client to 87 months, which I ­­ I think is the top of

11

the correct Guideline range.

12

you ­­ can you infer from that that the judge would not

13

have imposed that sentence had the judge understood

14

that ­­ the judge thought that the top was 96, judge

15

chose 87, that happens to fall within the correct

16

Guideline range.

17

the judge would have imposed a lesser sentence?

18

Would the same ­­ would

MR. CROOKS:

On those facts, would you infer that

Our answer is that whenever the

19

range changes in the absence of any other indication,

20

you should infer that the sentence ­­ there was at least

21

a reasonable probability that the sentence would change.

22

There may be other contextual factors

23

besides the high end of the Guidelines that would allow

24

the government to show that in fact it wouldn't have

25

made a difference.

But if I understand Your Honor's

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

question correctly, with only the difference in the

2

range, we believe that that is a situation where you

3

should assume there's a reasonable probability.

JUSTICE ALITO:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why would you ­­
I was ­­ I was just

6

going to say under that ­­ I suppose the defendant

7

really wouldn't insist on a resentencing if that were

8

the ­­ those were the facts, would he?

9

In other words, it was incorrectly a maximum

10

of 87 and he got the maximum, you say, oh, well the

11

correct one could give you up to 96.

12

it, the defendant is not going to raise that objection,

13

is he?

14

MR. CROOKS:

If I understand

If he believes that he could

15

get more ­­ but if ­­ for example, in this case the

16

incorrect range was 77 to 96.

17

well insist upon appealing because he might think the

18

judge would give me the high end of the correct range.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

If he got 96, he might

How about ­­ I mean, the

20

question is, if the judge ­­ the judge thinks it's 77 to

21

96 and chooses 87, which is within that range, and it

22

turns out the correct range is 70 to 87, so the 87 is

within the correct range as well ­­ it's the top of the

It is much more difficult to secure relief on

20

plain­error review because of the other prongs of the

21

rule.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The second prong is that the

on the second prong.
The fourth prong, that it must seriously

affect the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of

judicial proceedings, is another hurdle that the

defendant must meet on plain­error review.

to the third prong that we're suggesting, than it is to

example of a Guidelines error that would qualify for ­­

9

MR. CROOKS:

Yes.

In our reply brief on

page 22, we cited the Fifth Circuit's decision in

10

United States v. Duque­Hernandez.

11

Fifth Circuit actually pretermitted the first three

12

prongs of plain­error review and said even if you meet

13

these, you lose on the fourth prong for three different

14

reasons.

And in that case, the

15

First, the Court said that the defendant had

16

in fact admitted the criminal conduct that underlay the

17

controverted Sentencing Guideline enhancement.

18

Second, there was an issue of quasi dirty

19

hands because the defense attorney had failed to make an

20

objection that the same defense attorney had made in a

21

previous illegal reentry case.

22

And third, the defendant had an

23

extraordinarily serious criminal history involving drugs

24

and guns.

25

are others ­­ where the Fifth Circuit has applied the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The ­­
We're trying to ­­ let's

8

assume that we're going to give you some relief ­­ that

9

was far from clear, but let's assume that.

We're trying

10

to find out what the rule ought to be, what the standard

11

ought to be.

12

your view, should that case go back to the district

13

court?

In the case you just explained to us, in

14

MR. CROOKS:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. CROOKS:

The case that I just described?
Yes.
I ­­ I don't know whether I

17

necessarily agree with that application of the fourth

18

prong of plain­error ­­

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

prong in the first instance?

21

MR. CROOKS:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who applies the first
Is it ­­

The court of appeals.
So you're saying that

23

even if the court of appeals gets through the first

24

three, it doesn't remand for the district court to ­­ to

25

apply the fourth test.

It ­­ the court of appeals does

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1
2

that itself?
MR. CROOKS:

Correct.

And if the defendant

3

cannot satisfy the fourth prong of plain­error review,

4

there is no reversal and no resentencing.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I would think that the

6

answer to Justice Kennedy's question is if the court of

7

appeals really thinks it's not going to give relief

8

because of the fourth prong, why would you bother

9

remanding it?

10

MR. CROOKS:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why ­­ why would the court ­­
Why would ­­ why would the

12

court of appeals bother remanding it?

13

legitimately say it doesn't matter.

14

remand it because whatever happens on remand, we're not

15

going to give relief based on the fourth prong.

16

that's the case, why would the court of appeals remand

17

it at all?

18

MR. CROOKS:

They could
We're not going to

And if

The court of ­­ if the

19

defendant does not ­­ if the court of appeals is not

20

satisfied that the defendant has met his burden on the

21

fourth prong, it will not be remanded; the judgment will

22

be affirmed.

23
24
25

And I would like to save the remainder of my
time for rebuttal.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And may I just ask you to

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

answer the government's position that if there's no

2

presumption, it's not in your question presented so ­­

3

so that you will lock into the way you phrased the ­­

4

the question, that "should an appellate court presume"?

5

MR. CROOKS:

Just very briefly, our answer

6

is that the Court in the cases we cited in the reply

7

brief has gone on to consider the merits of a case after

8

deciding a legal question presented by the Petitioner.

9

And certainly, the Court always has the power and the

10

discretion to address a question, even that was not in

11

the question presented or addressed in the court below.

12

And here, the court below undisputably

13

addressed it, and even if the Court does not endorse the

14

presumption we ask for, it would be useful guidance to

15

the lower courts on the application of the third prong.

Mr. Meisler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A.C. MEISLER

19
20
21
22

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court should not adopt the presumption

23

that all misapplications of the Sentencing Guidelines

24

are presumptively prejudicial, for three main reasons:

25

First, a presumption is not supported by

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

this Court's plain­error precedence or general

2

principles of appellate review for harmlessness.

3

Second, presumption is unnecessary, because

4

courts of appeal are capable of discerning prejudice on

5

a case­specific basis.

6

And third, a presumption ill­serves the

7

policies ­­ policies that underlie Rule 52(b); in

8

particular, they need to induce timely objections in the

9

district court.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I ­­ I am concerned

11

about getting hung up on the labels.

12

so don't say it's a presumption.

13

we, the question of what happens if nobody ­­ and who

14

loses if there's no evidence to move one way or another

15

in a tie?

16

Okay?

If you ­­

We still have, don't

It doesn't matter if you call it a

17

"presumption" or not.

18

moving forward, and certainly the burden of proof, if

19

one of these errors is on the record?

20

MR. MEISLER:

Who bears the burden of at least

I think, Your Honor, this

21

Court's decisions in Olano and United States v. Vaughn

22

resolve that question, and makes it clear the burden is

23

on the defendant under plain­error review.

24

the Court has said is the main difference on prong three

25

on the substantial­rights prong between plain­error and

Alderson Court Reporting

That is what

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

26
1

harmless­error review.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But let's say that's right:

3

Yes, the burden is on the defendant.

4

defendant meet that burden by saying, look, there was a

5

mistake in the Guidelines; we know that there's an

6

anchoring effect.

7

That anchoring effect creates a reasonable probability

8

that the Court would have done something differently.

9

But does the

That's what the Court said in Peugh.

MR. MEISLER:

And so our ­­ our answer, Your

10

Honor, is that the ­­ there's no ­­ I guess what

11

Mr. Crooks calls a "generalized showing."

12

has to be done on a fact­specific basis.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think it

That is fact­specific.

I

14

mean, I have exactly the same question as Justice Kagan

15

had.

16

want to prove that it rained at noon on the 5th of

17

February.

18

Forget all the jargon.

You're a ­­ a lawyer.

Your witness says, I heard pitter­patter on

19

the roof.

20

window.

I looked outside.

Water was going by the

21

Anything else?

22

No.

23

Well, it might have been the window washer,

24

but there is no jury that couldn't find that it was

25

raining.

Alderson Court Reporting

You

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27
1

Same thing here.

Case after case, this

2

Court has said:

3

even use those words ­­ the Guidelines influence the

4

sentence.

5

We assume, we presume ­­ or they don't

That's what they meant by the word "anchor."

If you look at the reality, whether they

6

depart or don't ­­ whatever you call it now.

7

some special word ­­ you can find evidence after ­­ of

8

course, the Guidelines affect the sentence.

9

there's an unusual case, and they don't.

There's

Maybe

10

The reason the judge doesn't say anything is

11

because in Rita we said that if you say nothing, Judge,

12

then the appellate courts are to assume it was

13

reasonable.

14

He just applies the Guideline.

And therefore, the judge now says nothing.

15

So we'd have to overcome about five cases in

16

terms of what we said if we are going to rebut the

17

common sense notion that of course using the wrong

18

Guideline had an effect on the sentence.

19

unusual case, i.e. if it's the window washer, let the

20

government show it was the window washer.

21

normal case, pitter­patter means rain, and the normal

22

case is that the judge, when he uses the Guidelines, or

23

even when he uses them as a basis and says I'm

24

departing, that that made a difference.

25

MR. MEISLER:

If it's an

But the

Well, I think ­­ I think, Your

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

28
1

Honor, there's a ­­ there's a number of points in there,

2

and to my mind that's a question of how much weight to

3

give the bare facts of the error.

4

Of course the error in this case is you used

5

the wrong range.

6

what I understand Your Honor's position to be is that

7

the bare fact of the error, the difference in the range,

8

itself establishes an effect and substantial rights.

9

And so I think you're ­­ I ­­ from

That's not usually how we do it.

We say you

10

have to look at the particular facts and circumstances

11

in the case.

12

And I think Your Honor ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you ­­ can you give a

13

concrete example of what you mean?

14

intuition is the same as Justice Breyer and

15

Justice Kagan, that if you ­­ if you apply the wrong

16

Guidelines, then there's a reasonable probability that

17

he would have received a lower sentence.

18

I mean, in my ­­ my

But you say he has to show ­­ what would he

19

have to show, concretely?

20

a reasonable probability that he would have received a

21

lower sentence.

22
23

MR. MEISLER:

Give me an example of what is

Right.

Well, I think there's

just two points to that, Justice Ginsburg.

24

One is what the ­­ what the appellate court

25

is going to have before them in every Guidelines­error

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

29
1

case, which is the nature and the magnitude of the

2

error.

3

bump that changes the defendant's offense level and

4

criminal history and could double his range?

5

as in this case, a one­level movement on ­­ because of a

6

criminal history scoring error that the Sentencing

7

Guidelines, themselves, say you can offset with a

8

departure because it leads to under representation of ­­

9

of the defendant's recidivist potential.

10

The courts then know is this a career­offender

Or is it,

So the court's going to know nature and

11

magnitude.

And by "magnitude" I mean, are we talking

12

one level?

Are we talking 16?

13
14
15

Are we talking nine?

So there are going to be many cases.

I

don't dispute that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

There will be many.

And

16

there are many cases involving rain.

17

don't know how many thousands, but there are many common

18

facts in thousands of cases where the government itself

19

uses very similar kinds of evidence in order to show

20

that it was really raining.

21

Many.

I mean, I

And here, what we're doing is we're using

22

very similar kinds of evidence, namely, that he used the

23

wrong Guideline in order to show that, in fact,

24

better ­­ more probable than not, or pretty probable, or

25

whatever reasonable probability, that it made a

MR. MEISLER:

courts, I suppose you can make that argument.

2

But many circuits, or some circuits at

3

least, have the rule; they just remand it, ask the

4

district judge.

5

MR. MEISLER:

I'm not sure that's how

6

plain­error review has ever been conceived of,

7

Justice Kennedy.

I ­­ I mean, Your Honor asked before,

8

what's our rule?

You know, what is the rule the Court

9

had announced in this case without calling it

10

presumption?

11

case about what the standard should be, we think the

12

Court could say something such as that a difference in

13

the range, the use of the wrong range, creates some

14

likelihood in every case that the sentence will be

15

different.

16

required level of a reasonable probability is going to

17

depend on the factors and circumstances.

18

And if the Court wants to opine in this

But whether that likelihood arises to the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, haven't we already

19

answered that question in Peugh?

20

was whether the likelihood was going to rise to the

21

level of a significant risk.

22

you're using the wrong range, there is a significant

23

risk that you would have made a different decision.

24
25

In Peugh, the question

And we said yes.

If

So significant risk actually seems higher to
me than reasonable probability.

At least it's not

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32

2

demonstrably lower.
So I would think that we've already said, if

3

you're using the wrong range because of the anchoring

4

effect of the range ­­ an anchoring effect that is kind

5

of mandatory.

6

Guidelines are advisory, but we insist that a judge

7

begin with them.

It's ­­ you know, we say that these

So if you're using the wrong range, there is
a significant risk.

I would think so too, a

reasonable ­­ of reasonable probability.

11

Why ­­ why ­­ why is there a difference?

12

MR. MEISLER:

13
14

I ­­ this ­­ I think there's

two points on Peugh, Your Honor.
The first one is that Peugh itself, in

15

footnote 8, says that this is a ­­ this is an ex post

16

facto error that implicates constitutional concerns.

17

And the Court said, in their regular Chapman v.

18

California harmless­error analysis, Petitioner concedes

19

that when it's a nonconstitutional Guidelines error,

20

under Williams v. The United States in Rule 52(a), you

21

do the regular harmless­error standard.

22

We think it follows from that, that when the

23

error has been forfeited, not preserved, and there's no

24

constitutional concerns, do the regular plain­error

25

analysis.

This was going to be the

6

second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, which I

actually think that the ­­ framing it in terms of risk,

looking at how Peugh analyzed the issue actually lines

up almost exactly with how this Court handled the error

MR. MEISLER:

Right.

Well, I think, Your

Honor, the Court was faced with a similar situation in

6

the Davila case from a couple terms ago, where the

7

Respondent in that case had argued that ­­ and that

8

was ­­ that involved judicial participation and plea

discussions.

And the respondent in that case argued,

10

well, the courts of appeals are just finding all these

11

prejudicial and reversing them anyway.

12

doing cases if they're prejudiced.

13

an automatic reversal rule.

14

And this Court said no.

Don't bother

Let's come up with

But you would agree that

11

at least there are many cases where the judge just

12

sentences within the Guidelines.

MR. MEISLER:

There are many cases, but I

think you run into the same problem as in Davila.

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

you may know this empirical point better ­­ I think

22

there probably are a lot of cases where the issue is the

like this.

In some subset, there will be a plain­error

what the error was even though there's also a clear

the judge said nothing at all.

of the range, by statute, the judge is required, this

Court's decision in Rita requires that if the defendant

makes a nonfrivolous request for a variance and the

16

judge is choosing the Guidelines range, agreeing with

17

the Commission's recommendation, instead of giving that

18

non­Guideline sentence, the judge has to explain that as

well.

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's not that

Depending on the spread

If we ­­ if we accept the ­­

21

the proposition that in every case in which there is an

22

incorrect identification of the Guidelines at the time

23

of sentencing there has to be a remand, unless the

24

government can prove with some sort of evidence that it

25

was harmless, would there be any difference between the

Alderson Court Reporting

42

standard in a case where there was an objection and a

case where there was no objection?

MR. MEISLER:

6

he thinks the government's burden is, but I heard him

say today and I believe the citations at page 47 of his

brief also indicate that the standard would be the

9

Williams v. United States harmless­error standard.

The Petitioner's briefs

The

10

government would have to show no effect on the sentence.

It has to persuade the court of appeals the sentence

would agree that ­­ that prong two does some work in

these cases, not as much in other settings because

courts of appeals look at the plain language of the

Guidelines and the application notes and believe that

21

this follows from those ­­ that language.

22

And more importantly on prong four, which

So I think it's very unclear

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

To the extent that our

9

decision is influenced by our considerations of what

10

kind of a burden, say the Petitioner's proposed rule

11

would put on the resources of the Court, is there

12

anything we can look to or can you or your co­counsel or

13

your colleague for the Petitioner tell us how often

14

Sentencing Guidelines occur in 20 percent of the cases,

15

5 percent of the cases?

16

disruptive to ask the district court, what would you do?

Remand.

18

MR. MEISLER:

And when they do, is it that

A couple points.

On the

19

statistics, I believe they're collected in footnote 14

20

of Petitioner's brief, and there are something like

21

4,500 procedural sentencing appeals; about 2,400 of

22

those are Sentencing Guidelines appeals, and about 20

23

percent of those, or about 480, are reversed.

24
25

We haven't been able to ascertain how many
of those are plain­error cases versus harmless­error

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

44

cases, but it's a substantial number across the judicial

2

districts every year.

3

In terms of the cost, Petitioner's position

4

is that it's less costly than remand for a retrial.

5

don't dispute that, but we do think it's not costless.

6

The en banc Third Circuit, in a recent procedural

appendix to our brief, situations where the remand for

resentencing generates another round of appeals.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

What you have not put in

It's not about how to interpret Rule 52(b),

5

answer will be obvious, because I'm not going to

am going to disagree about what you think the effect of

I'd try to breech the gap between, perhaps, our

positions is ­­ is to recognize and to argue Rule 52(b)

And so our ­­ our basic position here, most

framework.

earlier.

That's a problem.

there is practically heavy reliance on that presentence

22

This

This is a ­­ a lawyer making a mistake by

MR. MEISLER:

I mean,

I think the issue,

23

Justice Ginsburg, is really incentives at the margins,

right, that in these kind of cases it's one ­­ and

25

that's what both Dominguez Benitez and Puckett say.

Alderson Court Reporting

We

want to incentivize lawyers to make these.
And if, indeed, the prong three inquiry ends

up being no different, the defendant's burden ends up

being no different in this cost of cases under plain

incentives ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You know, so much of

8

this is the use of that word "assumptions,"

9

"presumptions"; but both sides are doing it.

This case

10

came up because the Third Circuit has a presumption that

11

if a corrected ­­ it ­­ it says it:

12

Guidelines overlap, the wrong Guideline and the right

13

Guideline overlap, that there is no way ­­ we assume

14

there's no way you can prove error, or that it affected

15

substantial rights.

And there are a number of circuits

16

who have said that.

Overlapping Guidelines, you can

17

never prove.

18

We assume that if

That ­­ that seems that that's an assumption

19

that's wrong, under your articulation of plain­error

review.

21

MR. MEISLER:

If that's what the Fifth

22

Circuit were doing, I ­­ I would agree with Your Honor.

23

We don't think there should be a presumption either way.

24
25

I think the Fifth Circuit has ­­ as other
have ­­ circuits have ­­ have treated overlapping­range

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

cases a bit differently and have suggested that in those

2

cases, because the judge's sentence still aligns with

3

the Commission's recommendation, we're just going to

4

require a bit more.

5

looked for is something more concrete that moves the

6

dial from ­­

7

I think what the Fifth Circuit has

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So let's go to

8

Justice Alito's point.

9

the parties were fighting about extremes.

The more concrete here is that
Sentence him,

10

the government said, to the high end.

The defendant was

11

arguing he's entitled to the low end.

There is some

12

additional proof there.

13

The judge picks the low end.

If the Guideline is an anchor, which I think

14

is almost undisputed, isn't that enough to say it

15

affected substantial rights?

16

MR. MEISLER:

We don't think so in this

17

case.

18

abandoning our position that this fact­specific issue is

not properly before the Court.

if we're looking at case­specific determination here, I

I ­­ I guess I would

And that

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50

think the court of appeals could reasonably conclude,

And I think it's useful to

10

whether this kind of presumption could be confined to

11

the Sentencing Guidelines.

12

In 2001, the Third Circuit, a decision

brief that the courts of appeals have been relatively

4

I think the point is that this Court endorses the

it's highly unlikely it's going to stay just in the

Guidelines context, just because of the anchoring effect

that the Court recognized in Peugh.

Mr. Crooks, you have four minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS

14
15

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CROOKS:

With respect to Justice

16

Kennedy's question about the burden on the district

17

courts of resentencings, we would point out that several

18

lower courts in opinions we cited in the brief have

19

pointed out that a resentencing is not all that

20

burdensome, especially in light of the benefits of

21

assuring that defendants are not serving more prison

22

time than the district court wanted them to do.

23

I did also want to address the government's

24

point about ­­ the government touched on the issue of

25

overlapping ranges versus ranges that don't overlap.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

And we just wanted to point out that the effect of the

2

Guidelines is the same, regardless of whether the

3

correct and incorrect ranges overlap or not.

4

simply that the degree of the error, the amount of

5

excess imprisonment that is produced, will be different.

6

It will be lower in the case of an overlapping range.

7

But as this Court said in Glover v. United States, any

8

extra amount of imprisonment affects substantial rights.

It's

9

Finally, I just wanted to say that the

10

courts of appeals have overwhelmingly recognized,

11

whether you call it a presumption or not, that it is

12

warranted to find that a change in the Guideline range

13

affected a defendant's substantial rights because of the

14

extreme likelihood that a Guideline­range error will

15

skew the sentence.

16

And the lower courts have found, in their

17

experience, that it's necessary to make that inference

18
