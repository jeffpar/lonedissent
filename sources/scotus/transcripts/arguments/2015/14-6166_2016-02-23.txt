ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Hobbs Act has two elements.

The first

12

requires that the accused to obtain property from

13

another by either extortion or robbery.

14

the jurisdictional element, in that the consequence of

15

either the extortion or the robbery creates an

16

interference with commerce.

17

The second is

The effect on commerce is the jurisdictional

18

element of the crime, and like all elements, it must be

19

proven beyond a reasonable doubt through the

20

introduction of particularized evidence necessary to

21

establish this element.

22

In the case ­­ in this case the government

23

was not required to prove the effect­on­commerce

24

element, which ultimately resulted in the conviction of

25

Mr. Taylor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One of the things you say

2

in your brief is that you were not even given the

3

opportunity to show that the victims dealt exclusively

4

in home­grown marijuana.

5

If you ­­ if you had that opportunity, how

6

will you have shown that this, the marijuana in

7

question, was grown in Virginia rather than some other

8

place, some other State?

9

MR. JONES:

Your Honor, they're ­­ in all

10

likelihood, I would either call as a witness a retired

11

DEA agent or an ATF agent or a retired local police

12

officer who had years of experience in that field

brief not only the DEA statistics for a time period

19

that's shown not only the amount of marijuana that was

20

subject to the eradication plan of DEA in Virginia but

21

also a couple of local news articles and events where in

22

Botetourt County, I think the most current one was 2013,

23

about the time we were before the Fourth Circuit.

24
25

It's been going on for years and years and

There's not necessarily ­­ we ­­ we cited in our

every State in the Union.

2

you wanted to submit proof that the victims dealt

3

exclusively in home­grown marijuana, and since every

4

other State also has marijuana dealers, how could you ­­

5

how could you show exclusively, that this marijuana came

6

exclusively?

MR. JONES:

But you made that ­­ you said

11

even going into that area with ­­ with the victims.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

Well, Mr. Jones, suppose you

13

had been able to show this.

14

15

marijuana exclusively.

16

17

MR. JONES:

Suppose you had been able

What difference would that have

Under the ­­ under the terms of

18

the Hobbs Act, the government would have borne the proof

19

of going forward and ­­ and showing an effect on ­­ on

20

interstate commerce with ­­ with that ­­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you see, that's the

22

thing.

23

requires the government to show an effect on interstate

24

commerce.

25

Hobbs Act only requires an effect on commerce, and then

I mean, I don't think that the Hobbs Act

As you said in your opening statement, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

commerce is defined:

2

which the United States has jurisdiction.

3

Commerce means all commerce over

Now, for sure the United States has

4

jurisdiction over interstate commerce, but under Raich

5

it also has jurisdiction over intrastate drug

6

trafficking.

7

And so if you just sort of put the pieces of

8

the statutes together, it seems to make it completely

9

irrelevant whether the drug trafficking was intrastate

10

or interstate, because in either case, it was commerce

11

over which the United States has jurisdiction.

12

MR. JONES:

I think the difference

13

between ­­ I think what Hobbs addressed ­­ excuse me ­­

14

what Raich addressed was, of course, the Controlled

15

Substance Act.

16

Controlled Substance Act is ­­ is a matter

17

of regulation of ­­ of interstate commerce and not so

19

the effect on ­­ on commerce.

is the effect, not so much the regulation.

3

MR. JONES:

So why isn't that enough?

5

Because this statute, again, does not require that there

6

be an effect on interstate commerce.

that was purchased and used by that business that was

2

manufactured and transported from Georgia to Virginia.

3

The evidence in ­­ in those cases showed that whatever

4

the subject or the ­­ of the commodity that was being

5

sold or used by that particular enterprise had ­­ had

6

traveled in interstate commerce, and in some instances

7

the individual himself had traveled in interstate

commerce.

So you had evidence to that fact.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. ­­

Mr. Jones, I guess I'm

14

trying to figure out what we're disagreeing about.

15

let me give you a proposition, and you tell me whether

16

you agree with it.

17

So

The Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that

18

affect marijuana trafficking, whether the marijuana

19

trafficking is interstate or intrastate.

20

Do you agree with that?

21

MR. JONES:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I disagree with that.
But why is that?

Because

23

that's what I was saying at the beginning, that it seems

24

clear to me that under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the

25

Hobbs Act does prohibit robberies that affect commerce.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

Raich says commerce includes both interstate and

2

intrastate marijuana trafficking.

3

prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking

4

generally, whether it's interstate or intrastate.

So the Hobbs Act

5

What's there to disagree with in that?

6

MR. JONES:

I ­­ I agree from the standpoint

7

that the Controlled Substance Act under Raich regulates.

8

But beyond that point, what the Hobbs ­­ if Congress had

9

wanted to use the word "regulate" rather than

10

"affects" ­­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MR. JONES: ­­ Congress could very easily

13

Well ­­

have done that.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but I said ­­ I used

15

the word "affects."

16

I said the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect

17

commerce.

18

trafficking or intrastate marijuana trafficking under

19

the definition in this statute.

20

government has to show that a robbery affected some kind

21

of marijuana trafficking.

22

Wouldn't you agree with that?

I didn't use the word "regulate."

Commerce is either interstate marijuana

23

MR. JONES:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

So you ­­ the

It doesn't matter what kind.

Yeah.

I mean, it just seems ­­
I ­­ I ­­

­­ it's the current of the

statute plus Raich.

Alderson Reporting Company

15
1

MR. JONES:

Right.

It's ­­ it's the

2

commodity that's the subject of the robbery that has

3

to ­­ has to affect.

4

the Hobbs Act, in the plain language of it ­­ and I

5

think we're talking about the very last phrase, commerce

6

that's regulated by Congress, in ­­ in that situation,

7

if the commodity itself is a standalone, if that's the

8

interpretation of the statute, then commerce is affected

9

by ­­ by the taking of ­­ of the commodity subject just

10

And if ­­ if Congress ­­ if ­­ if

because it's regulated, nothing more.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess this goes back

12

to Justice Kennedy's question.

13

pretty self­evident that a robbery of a business affects

14

a business.

I mean, seems to me

Wouldn't you think that that's right?

15

MR. JONES:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes ­­
I mean, I don't think that

17

the word "affects" is doing a whole lot of work here,

18

because of course a robbery of a business affects a

19

business, right?

20

MR. JONES:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, ma'am.
Okay.

So ­­ so it's not

22

really "affects" that's the problem here.

23

seems to be that you're resisting the notion that the

24

business could be entirely intrastate.

25

The problem

But what I'm suggesting is that the terms of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

the Hobbs Act itself, given Raich, make clear that the

2

business can be intrastate, because the definition of

3

commerce here doesn't say "interstate commerce."

4

says "commerce over which the United States has

5

jurisdiction."

6

United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug

7

dealing.

MR. JONES:

In ­­ in congressional hearings,

the congressional hearings that we have, and the

8

conclusions that they come to after they go through that

9

process and there's satisfaction of that, they

10

promulgate the law.

11

But if they create in ­­ in the passage

12

of ­­ of that acts; for example here, the Hobbs Act is

13

what we're saying is the ­­ is the plain reading of it,

14

is that if ­­ if in their wisdom the element is to

15

establish this element, then it becomes an element of

16

the criminal offense.

17

And it's not so much the element of the

18

regulation, but it's the element of the criminal

offense.

anything ­­ any purely ­­ any local activity that is of

12

a type which, if taken in the aggregate, would have a

13

substantial effect on interstate commerce, that falls

14

within the Commerce Clause.

15

If the jury is instructed in that way, and

16

that's basically the way I think it was instructed here,

17

all they have to find is that there was a theft of ­­

18

there was a robbery of drugs, and it had some effect on

19

the supply of drugs.

20

MR. JONES:

In this case I think they were

instructed that our ­­ our view of that instruction was

22

that it was a per se or strict liability instruction;

23

that if ­­ if ­­ because in that instruction, it's my

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

21
22
23
24
25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Three characteristics of Petitioner's
robberies underscore that this case falls within

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1
2

Congress's Commerce Clause power.
Petitioner's robberies targeted, first, the

3

inventory in a commodity; two, that inventory belonged

4

to a commercial participant; and third, it was a

5

commercial participant in an established interstate

6

market in marijuana that is a Federally­controlled

7

substance over which Congress has exercised

8

jurisdiction.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if it weren't

10

commercial aspect, then you wouldn't ­­ you wouldn't ­­

11

you would have to demonstrate jurisdiction beyond a

12

reasonable doubt?

13

MR. YANG:

No.

I think there ­­ what ­­

14

when you get out of the commercial sphere, the courts of

15

appeals have drawn a distinction between robberies of

16

businesses that are engaged in commerce, as the victims

17

were here, and true individuals who just get robbed.

18

And I think the courts have fairly uniformly

19

recognized that the ­­ while the robbery of a business

20

is kind of economic in nature and more directly

21

implicates Commerce Clause concerns, when there's a

22

robbery of an individual, the links are much more

23

attenuated and there's a longer chain of causation to

24

get to commerce.

25

And so in those contexts, even within the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24

depletion of assets theory that my brother espouses

2

before the Court, the courts have said, as a normal

3

matter, robberies of individuals just don't fall within

8
9

But what we have here is the

It's in the marijuana

It's difficult to, I think, come to any
other conclusion, that the robbery of such marijuana

10

from marijuana dealers engaged in trade over which

11

commerce has jurisdiction is not a robbery that affects

12

commerce over which the United States ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, except that

14

Congress doesn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

15

before exercising its jurisdiction that there's an

affect on interstate commerce.

MR. YANG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you're

23

that the robbery affected commerce over which the United

under the rational­basis review that often occurs in

marijuana trade is based on a different standard of

proof than the criminal one.

22

much more daunting standard of proof.

23

MR. YANG:

But now you

We're not shying away from the

24

standard of proof.

25

question of whether a robbery affects interstate

But what ­­ as we explained, the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

commerce has both legal elements as well as factual

2

elements.

3

The factual elements, as we explain in our

4

brief in this case, involve:

5

Were they robbing and targeting the marijuana of

6

marijuana dealers?

7

Did the robbery occur?

But the legal question ­­ which judges every

8

day instruct juries under what the law is, and Gaudin

9

teaches us that juries must follow those instructions ­­

10

the legal conclusion is that the United States has

11

jurisdiction over the entire marijuana trade.

12

Now, there would be strange anomalies if

13

juries were allowed to relitigate Raich in every case.

Is there an affect ­­ you know, does Congress have

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Yang, I'd like to ­­

11

for you to explain to me what the difference in charges

12

are between this robbery and a regular robbery, let's

say of a business.

14

many circuits that say if you just rob a person

15

individually, that's not a Hobbs Act robbery.

in a regular Hobbs Act case and this kind of case?

So how does a judge charge

Well, it will depend, I think, in

part on the government's theory of the case.

20

21

theory, and the judge would have to charge with

22

respect ­­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

I understand the

charges, counsel.
MR. YANG:

So in the normal case, and this

is the ­­ this is kind of the ­­ the mind run of cases

2

that all the courts of appeals have accepted are as kind

of a depletion­of­assets theory case.

4

Now, in those types of cases when you're

5

involving the robbery of a business, the government puts

6

on evidence ­­ this could be any type of business pretty

7

much ­­ that the business engages in some kind of

Is the jury charged that

this particular robbery had to affect that?
MR. YANG:

Yes, because what they end up ­­

the theory, the depletion of assets theory, which again,

23

this has been established in all the courts of appeals

24

for quite some time, is that even if you're robbing

of assets theory and says that the government has to

17

show that this marijuana moved in interstate commerce,

18

or that the dealers sold to people out of State, which I

will note parenthetically is a little difficult when

20

we're talking about an attempt, and we're talking about

in marijuana, and that, therefore, in this theory ­­

which is different, it's a different way of proving the

here, the evidence was sufficient because there was

sufficient evidence to show that these ­­ the Southwest
