ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. ASAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Under ­­ under the principles this Court

12

adopted in Travelers, Vermont's collection of health

13

care data is not preempted.

14

not affect ERISA plans in any way that undermines

15

ERISA's core objectives, does not require plans to offer

16

benefits, affect the financing or fiduciary standards

17

for plans, or change the way the plans administer

18

benefits to their members.

19

The database statute does

Vermont is merely collecting standardized

20

data that Blue Cross necessarily generates and already

21

provides to the State for itself and other entities.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it hasn't been argued

23

by Liberty, and we can ask them about that, that this is

24

burdensome, that it might be different from State to

25

State and so forth, and it may be that this sounds more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in conflict preemption than statutory preemption.

2

can you just answer a few questions?

3

Does this apply to people that are not

4

residents in Vermont but that have been treated in

5

Vermont?

6

And does it also apply to people that are

7

outside of ­­ that are Vermonters but are treated

8

outside Vermont?

9
10
11
12
13

But

I mean, what ­­ who is the universe to whom
these ­­ this applies?
And it seems to me that that would be
difficult for plans to ­­ to figure out.
MS. ASAY:

As implemented by the board, Your

14

Honor, the ­­ the database requirements apply to

15

Vermonters receiving health care services from a covered

16

insurer regardless of their location, so both inside

17

Vermont and outside Vermont, if it's paid for by a

18

covered insurer.

not to require data from non­Vermont residents receiving

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We ­­ we ­­ we ought to

consider that, don't you think?

4

MS. ASAY:

I don't ­­ I don't believe so,

5

Your Honor, because the ­­ the program that has been

6

challenged here by Liberty Mutual is the program as it

7

has been implemented by the board, and that ­­ that is

8

how it has been implemented.

9

And this kind of generally applicable health

10

care regulation is not preempted for the reasons that

11

this Court has expressed in a series of decisions,

12

including Travelers, De Buono, Mackey, and Dillingham.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What of the point that

14

Justice Kennedy suggested, that ­­ that States can have

15

different reporting requirements?

16

like Egelhoff in that respect, that if there were

17

uniform requirements, that would be less burdensome, but

18

if each State has its own specifications, then that

19

becomes burdensome and costly.

20

MS. ASAY:

So it's a little bit

Your Honor, two responses to

21

that.

22

this record that there is any cognizable burden on the

23

third­party administrators who are health care insurers

24

who generate this data and are providing it already in

25

their capacity as insurers.

The first is that there is simply no evidence in

Alderson Reporting Company

6
1

Second, certainly some States may choose to

2

do these programs differently, but as several of the

3

amicus briefs explain, including the brief from the

4

National Association of Health Data Organizations, these

5

are carefully designed programs that track the

6

electronic transaction rule under HIPAA that provides

7

national standards for electronic claims transactions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose States had

different reporting requirements and the plan showed ­­

10

they haven't ­­ I don't think showed, but suppose they

11

showed that this was burdensome.

12

analysis of the preemption question?

13

MS. ASAY:

Does that affect the

Only in this way, Your Honor:

14

think that the Court's holding in Travelers can be

15

distilled to basically three questions.

16

question is:

17

The first

Does the plan ­­ does the State law

18

specifically and directly regulate ERISA plans only?

19

That's not at issue in this case.

20

I

It does not.

The second question is whether the State is

21

regulating in an area that Congress reserved to the

22

States or is regulating in an area with which ERISA is

23

principally concerned.

24

in classic health care regulation, so on that question

25

the answer is no.

And here the State is engaging

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

You could say

sets out are about the plan finances:

There's a couple of reasons for that.

One

is that the Affordable Care Act itself has a ­­ has a ­­

an ­­ almost an anti­preemption provision, a provision

5

that says that the Affordable Care Act only prevents

Part 7 of ERISA also, which has those
amendments in it, is not part of ERISA as it was

originally passed.

itself has a provision that says it does not ­­

anti­preemption provision, but there is also a provision

18

in the Affordable Care Act that says that the ­­ the

provisions that are added have no effect on the ERISA

preemption provision.

MS. ASAY:

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is in

And it is true that there is sort of an

That's right, Your Honor.
So what do you make of that?

Now, suppose, instead of

24

that, what they say is, what we would like is that all

fiduciaries of ERISA plans send us each month a report

of all of the benefits under the retirement plan that

2

they have paid to any member.

3

Can they do that?

4

MS. ASAY:

Your Honor, I think the answer to

5

that probably depends on the area in which the State is

6

regulating.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what they're doing is

8

they have their ­­ their Secretary of Health and Human

9

Services that would like to know how wealthy or poor the

10

workers are.

MS. ASAY:

question?

6

that.

Labor Department first or HHS and say, we want uniform

8

rules here, or whether they have to come to you when the

9

rules of 50 States turn out to be a mess.

10

And you ­­ you ­­ you say you want to go

11

first and let them come after me, and I think the other

12

side says no.

13

to the Labor Department, get a national rule that gives

14

you large range to get what you want.

If you want to do what you want to do, go

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

to that question.

18

And ­­
And I don't know the answer

That's why I ask it.

MS. ASAY:

And, Your Honor, the answer to

19

that question is that, because this is classic health

20

care regulation for which States are responsible ­­

21

insurance rate review, budget review, health care

22

research ­­ it is an area in which States are permitted

23

to regulate.

24

slightly differently from State to State.

25

And they're permitted to regulate even

And as the Department of Labor, the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

government agrees with us that this is an area that

2

ERISA leaves to the States, even though it involves data

3

collection, because ERISA cannot possibly have been

4

intended to sweep away all collection of information

5

from plans by States.

6

expansive definition of a welfare benefit plan and ERISA

7

that includes, not just the direct provision of medical

8

care, but also day care centers, apprenticeship

9

programs, prepaid legal services.

Congress adopted a deliberately

These are all areas

10

in which when plans would act, they would necessarily be

11

providing information to States.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

I ­­ I see that ­­ I ­­ I

13

see that argument as to ERISA as originally enacted, but

14

I am very troubled by the fact that it now authorizes

15

the collection of data for the purpose of improving

16

health outcomes ­­ health care outcomes.

17

see how that ­­ unless the anti­preemption provision

18

saves the day, I don't see how that does not undermine

19

your principal argument, which is that ERISA may preempt

20

reporting of financial data and that sort of thing, but

21

it doesn't preempt the collection of data regarding

22

health care.

23

MS. ASAY:

I ­­ I don't

Your Honor, the ­­ the scope of

24

ERISA's preemption provision in 1144 is governed by what

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so this Court, when it is

I really don't see how that

7

can possibly be.

8

tomorrow that says one of the core purposes of ERISA is

9

to collect health care information, and here is a ­­

If Congress enacted an amendment

10

here is the health care collecting requirement, you

11

would say, well, that's not preempted, because that

12

wasn't the purpose when they enacted the preemption

13

provision, originally.

14

MS. ASAY:

I would certainly say that was

15

not preempted if it was added to Part 7, which says that

16

Part 7 does not affect the test for ERISA preemption in

17

1144.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, saying it doesn't

19

affect the test is quite different from saying that ­­

20

that ­­ that nothing changes.

same, but now, that test is applied to collection,

22

which ­­ which the Labor Department is itself

conducting, or is itself authorized to conduct.

2

MS. ASAY:

It would change the test, Your

3

Honor, because if ERISA was now considered to have a

4

broader, expansive scope that intruded into health care,

5

that would change this Court's settled precedent in

probably many reporting requirements, incident to State

25

laws in other substantive fields.

So, for example, the

Solicitor General gave the example of day care centers.

ERISA plans can run day care centers.

I don't think

And so forth.

This Court's case in De Buono upheld a tax

7

imposed on employer contributions to an ERISA medical

8

benefit plan that provided the medical benefits

directly.

And we told the Court at the time that that

10

tax had all sorts of reporting requirements.

11

essentially, the question is here, where to draw the

12

line between reporting requirements that are permissible

13

and those that are nonpermissible.

14

So

As I take Respondent's view, it's that

15

they're ­­ it's certain information that is so core to

16

the plan that you simply can't have State law reporting

17

requirements about that information.

I don't think that can be right.

Take, for

19

example, real property held in trust by a pension plan.

20

DOL requires reporting on that.

State taxing authority can require reporting about that

way the apprenticeship program was set up.

And

I

It was literally the

So I don't think the test can be whether the

7

information is, in some sense, core to ERISA.

8

the test has to be, is this reporting requirement

9

incident to a law in the field governed by ERISA, ­­

I think

10

vesting, funding, fiduciary duties and so forth ­­ or is

11

it incident to a law in health care, or in day care

center regulation?

13

Here, I don't think anyone disputes:

This

information is used for hospital budget review, for

health insurance rate review, for medical research.

16

There's no question that it's incident to classic State

health care regulation.

burdensome that effectively frustrates or impedes the

Well, I ­­ I think the way it's

different than conflict preemption, or at least one way,

is that if it actually is in the core field governed by

ERISA, I mean, if the State said, we just want to make

17

sure these pension plans are well­funded, so we're going

to ask for reports incident to that role, it would be

preempted even if the requirements weren't particularly

your opinion and the opinion of a few other justices

think if the Court were to say what we've been doing all

along is field preemption, and it makes more sense

doctrinally to classify it that way, from the Department

MR. BASH:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's something very

10

intuitive about their argument, and it's ­­ it's

11

essentially what Justice Kennedy said.

12

when 50 States devise 50 different requirements for

13

this, different formatting, different particular

14

information requested, that just all adds up to a lot of

15

hassle, which all adds up to a lot of money.

16

MR. BASH:

Two points.

It's ­­ it's

I mean, first it

17

seems far less burdensome than State laws this Court has

18

already upheld, or that State laws that I think most

19

people would agree have to be upheld.

20

I mean, the tax ­­ or the surcharge in

21

Travelers ­­ that was the case where you bought

22

commercial insurance, you had to pay a surcharge up to

23

24 percent more on medical purchases, that's

24

unbelievably burdensome, and surely had reporting

25

requirements associated with it.

And having to pay

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

vastly different surcharges in 50 States could be

2

burdensome too.

3

What this Court's precedents have said,

4

including Travelers and Dillingham and De Buono is that

5

a mere burden is not enough.

6

that it interferes with the administration of benefits.

What has to be shown is

7

So in Egelhoff ­­

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but a

9

consistent theme in our cases, when you say a mere

10

burden is not enough, is that the government wants

11

employers to, one, set things up ­­ they don't have to

12

­­ and two, they want the money to go to benefits, not

13

to go to administrative and bureaucracy expenses.

14

Is it your view in analyzing this question,

15

do we look at what would happen if 50 States adopted

16

different programs, or do we look at just Vermont

17

because Vermont happens to be first?

18

MR. BASH:

The former.

Our view is you have

19

to contemplate the 50 States would adopt different

20

regimes?

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, I think that's

right.

changes the way plans are administered or designed.

Respondent has not made that showing here.

the opinion is written.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A signal goal of ERISA enacted in 1974 was
to foster employee benefit plans that could operate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

nationally under nationally uniform rules of

2

administration, first and foremost, rules about

3

recordkeeping and reporting.

4

Now, of course ERISA plans, like other

5

regular businesses, are subject to ancillary regulation

6

like maintaining a safe workplace, paying minimum wage

7

and prevailing wage laws, paying their State real estate

8

taxes on their headquarters, and if they choose to run a

9

hospital, run a law firm for their legal services,

10

benefit program, run a childcare center, they are

11

subject to local regulation like other providers of

12

those local services.

13

But in every single case in this Court, and

14

every lower court decision that I have found in which

15

courts have upheld, State by State, reporting

16

requirements, it has always been incident to a

17

substantive obligation that the State could impose.

18

no one contends that Vermont could impose substantive

19

regulations on the claims that Liberty Mutual pays under

20

its employment plan.

21

Now, I want to go to the point of ­­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Mr. Waxman, why was it that

23

you introduced absolutely no evidence of burden in the

24

lower courts here?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

That is not true, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

­­ so I ask you:

If it

8

does come about, if it should come about and you lost

9

this case, why can't your clients go right to the

10

Department of Labor, whose regulations I've read, or

11

possibly ACCA, and say, we want you to impose a uniform

12

national data collection system or the equivalent, put

13

limits, and then preempt the conflicting State limits?

14

Now, it may be other members of the Court do

15

not agree with this approach, but I've written a case,

16

MetroMedia, where I think the agencies have a lot of

17

power there, and I think they have more capacity to

18

decide this kind of thing than a group of judges.

19

So what about that for you?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21
22

Justice Breyer, a couple of

points:
First, in the lower court and in this Court,

23

neither party on the other side has disputed what I

24

think is the self­evident proposition, that the

25

Department of Labor and now the Department of Labor and

Alderson Reporting Company

the Department of Health and Human Services, absolutely

2

have the statutory authority under ERISA to impose the

3

kind of recordkeeping and reporting requirements that

4

Vermont and now 17 or 19 other States do.

5

never disavowed that.

6

invitation stage and the merits stage sort of coyly

7

suggests that that's right, and ­­

8
9

They have

The ­­ the SG's brief at both the

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

Of course.
And to think about what

things they want.

15

So I mean, just again, let's go back to this

16

burden because it is a very intuitive idea that you have

17

on your side:

18

money.

19

I mean, as I understand what's going on here, that all

4

what's the cost?

MR. WAXMAN:

I ­­ there is not a ­­

10

18

Congress made the determination that this Court has

19

reflected in many, many of its decisions, including

20

Egelhoff, that the very fact that there could be 50

21

different State regulations is the burden that the

burden, about the fact that Blue Cross Blue Shield

14

doesn't have all this information in the normal course,

15

the multi­employer plans don't have it, and Blue Cross

16

I am not sure that the

Department of Labor has the regulatory authority to

21

essentially excuse the preemption provision, but ­­ and

22

you don't have to just go to the provision of ERISA that

23

you quoted ­­ in 1024(a)(2)(B) of ERISA, it authorizes

the Secretary of Labor to require the production of,

JUSTICE BREYER:

You might think this is not

there are two competing problems.

One is they should be

19

And I think there are probably 100 or 200

20

people in Department of Labor and HHS that could write

21

regs that reconcile those problems and allow both.

22

I can't, because I'm a judge.

23

But

So what I'm trying to figure out is how to

24

interpret this statute in a way that achieves those

25

objectives.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WAXMAN:

How to interpret this statute

2

as to say that in exchange for blanket Federal

3

regulation of these plans, now augmented in the context

4

of health care plans by the Affordable Care Act, the ­­

5

by the Federal government, the States are preempted from

6

regulating the core functions of what an ERISA plan

7

does.

8

of benefits.

And there is nothing more core than the payment

9

If the State is attempting to regulate,

10

whether it's by substantively regulating or imposing a

11

recordkeeping or reporting obligation about the very

12

activity that defines it as an ­­ as an ERISA plan, the

13

payment of benefits, that State law necessarily relates

14

to, because it has a connection with, an ERISA plan.

15

And frankly, it's pretty ironic that the

16

Petitioner and the government claim on the one hand that

17

it is so important to get this information from these

18

plans because 60 percent of all citizens in the

19

United States get their health care from these

20

self­funded plans, and yet requiring them to keep the

21

particular records that the State wants and to report it

22

on a quarterly, annually, or monthly basis, has no

23

relation to or connection with the plan.

24

understand how both of those thoughts can inhere at the

25

same time.

I understand completely that there should be some

restriction on overly burdensome State regulations of

5

whatever kind.

6

7

that this regulation falls in a different category than

9

here clearly is not attempting to, and is not

Because the State

11

that has an effect on your operations, no doubt, but the

12

State is operating in a completely separate area for

13

completely separate purposes in a way that does not

14

trump or conflict with, or anything else, the choices

15

that ERISA has made as to payment of benefits.

burden, or at least included, as in the last section of

22

terribly burdensome there might be another question,

that ERISA plans might have to pay to get benefits or

6

And so it took several sentences in each of

7

those ­­ several paragraphs in each of those opinions

8

even to explain how putting a tax on the non­Blue Cross

14

is, it is not a regulation that is directed at the very

15

activity that makes the plan an ERISA plan, you do look

16

at burden.

But if ­­ as this Court explained in the last section of

18

Travelers, if it's too burdensome, it might be

19

preempted.

They were indirect

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're ­­ you're saying

2

that the State simply cannot have an all ­­ all­payer

even though it's going to leave a big hole in the

information that the State has about that health care

6

being given to its citizens,

The State of Vermont, just to take one

11

example:

12

Secretary to obtain this information from everybody, not

13

only who pays for health care in Vermont, but the

14

hospitals and clinics that provide it.

15

Secretary, the executive official has chosen not to

16

require that information from hospitals and clinics and

17

doctors in Vermont.

18

The database statute authorizes the relevant

But the

There is also no doubt that if all­payer

19

claims databases so badly need the information from

20

self­funded plans, and it turns out that the self­funded

21

plan ­­ a significant number of self­funded plans say

22

no, that's preempted, the Federal government has all the

23

authority it needs to get that information and require

24

that that information be provided, either to the

25

Secretary and then to the States, or directly to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44

States.
And in fact, they can do what often happens

3

in areas of field preemption and express preemption,

4

which is to make it worth the plan's while.

5

They can offer all sorts of benefits to self­employed

6

plans to provide this information if it's so important.

What's interesting when we're talking about

8

what is or isn't in the record in this case, is no

providers of these health care services to provide the

information and that it is inadequate.
