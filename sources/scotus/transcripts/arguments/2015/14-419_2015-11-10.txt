ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SREBNICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The Sixth Amendment has always recognized

11

the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain

12

the advice and assistance of counsel.

13

the adoption of the Bill of Rights, that was the core

14

right, a time when the right to appointed counsel had

15

not yet been established by this Court.

16

At the time of

We submit that the right to representation

17

by private counsel must allow a defendant to use assets

18

which she rightfully owns, assets over which there is no

19

dispute that she has good title, so that she may be

20

represented by the lawyer that she prefers.

21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do about

Monsanto?

23

MR. SREBNICK:

In Monsanto and in Caplin &

24

Drysdale, those were cases involving tainted funds, drug

25

money.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So what is

2

the logic that says it doesn't violate the Sixth

3

Amendment if it's tainted funds, but it does if it's

4

untainted funds?

5

MR. SREBNICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the ­­ the

6

logic is that no one has a rightful claim to drug money.

7

No one can claim a valid property right in drug

8

proceeds.

9

not drug money.

10

They are her lawful assets.

They are

not connected to any crime at all.

11
12

Ms. Luis is wanting to use assets that are

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Srebnick, I mean,

compare two situations.

13

One is the one that Monsanto talked about

14

where, yeah, a bank robber goes in and he has a pile of

15

money now.

16

wants to use that money to pay for an attorney, too bad.

And Monsanto says, you know, even though he

17

Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of

18

money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses

19

that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other

20

expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for

21

the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer.

22
23
24
25

Why should the two cases be treated any
differently for Sixth Amendment purposes?
MR. SREBNICK:

Because no amount of

so­called dissipation, as the government would suggest,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

negates petitioner's lawful interest in the property she

2

owns apart from any alleged criminal activity.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but is ­­

4

doesn't it make sense the ­­ the sort of substitution

5

rule?

6

activity ­­ money and you had $5 million, and you spent

7

$10 million, you can't say, you know, oh, I spent the

8

drug money, you can't touch the $5 million.

9

me that's what the statute is doing when it says

I mean, if you've got $10 million in drug

It seems to

10

whatever it's a reasonable substitute or assets

11

substituted for.

12

MR. SREBNICK:

And so, Mr. Chief Justice, of

13

course, if there is a conviction, if the defendant is

14

found guilty, after the conviction when punishment is

15

determined, there may well be the opportunity for the

16

government to seek punishment that includes the

17

financial penalties associated with the crime.

18

before that time, pretrial, when the defendant is the

19

exclusive owner of the untainted assets, there is no

20

principle of law that deprives her of the right.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, but I ­­ I thought

22

the Chief Justice's question was slightly different.

23

don't know if you were privileged to hear the exciting

24

MR. SREBNICK:

Can you ­­
So just to

Well, in this case, it's a

8

simple answer, because here we have a stipulation, Joint

9

Appendix 161, that the assets that are the subject of

10

the dispute here today are assets that are undisputedly

11

untainted, not traceable to the crime.

12

for example, family jewelry, not traced to any criminal

13

activity.

They include real estate that was acquired

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me go back to

16

Justice ­­ Justice Kagan's question and ask it in ­­ in

17

a different way.

18

So you ­­ we have two brothers and ­­ twin

19

brothers, and they rob a bank.

20

split it up, $5,000 each.

21

happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes

22

and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present.

23

they go out to party, and one of them ­­ and they both

24

spend $5,000 partying.

One of them spends the money

25

from the bank robbery.

The other one spends the money

They get $10,000.

They

that was given to them by their rich uncle.

2

position is that the one who spent the money from the

3

so­called "tainted assets," the money from the bank

4

robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire

5

an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?

MR. SREBNICK:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. SREBNICK:

What sense does that make?
Because the property interest

11

defendant has allegedly committed a crime, simply

12

because there's probable cause.

position?

MR. SREBNICK:

Well, the ­­ the government

19

is concerned about what we would ­­ have described as

20

the so­called wily criminal.

21

the money, the tainted assets, faces perhaps even more

22

punishment at the end of the day or at the end of the

23

conviction, either through money laundering charges or

24

otherwise.

25

The defendant who spends

So the Court, keeping in mind that

forfeiture has as its primary component punishment,

there are ways of disincentivizing these kinds of

property interest in assets that are wholly apart from

6

any criminal activity.

Is it your position the

MR. SREBNICK:

Our position is that there's

a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to

retain counsel.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the answer is you

can ­­ the government can stop the tuition payment but

kinds of instances.

the Court and say there's a strong compelling need for

brief.

MR. SREBNICK:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.
But the logic of your

argument would suggest that you can't freeze untainted

assets for anything, because you're saying the

government has no property right to it.

It's untainted.

10

It's your money; it's not their money until they secure

11

a judgment.

12

I think, they can't restrain untainted assets, period,

13

constitutionally or statutorily.

14
15
16

And so the logic of your position would be,

MR. SREBNICK:

Well, we do not go that far

20

to me, how do we then limit it?

21

MR. SREBNICK:

But once we announce

Well, I suppose that if

22

there's no Sixth Amendment right at stake, if there's no

23

constitutional right to use the asset today, I don't

know of any prohibition, provided that there's due

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you said that this ­­

this is her property.

5

untainted, it is her money.

6

Justice Sotomayor has asked a fair question.

7

If it's tainted, you say she
But if it's

So I think

Isn't the logic of your position that the

8

untainted assets can be used without restraint for

9

whatever she wants to use it for?

10

MR. SREBNICK:

Justice Ginsburg, from a

11

constitutional perspective, I don't think that that's

12

necessarily correct because the courts can give

13

injunctive power to restrain assets, even assets

14

currently belonging to the defendant.

15

when such an injunction interferes with the

16

constitutionally protected right to retain counsel of

17

choice.

18

Our objection is

And so while the statute could

19

constitutionally allow, provided that there is adequate

20

hearings, et cetera, the restraint of even a defendant's

21

owned assets, lawfully owned assets, that principle

22

can't extend to assets ­­ the subset of assets she needs

to use counsel of choice.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

limit your ­­ your principle to the Sixth Amendment.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Srebnick, this goes

back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question.

11

It seems that the distinction that you're making is one

12

that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto.

13

other words, the Court said the Sixth Amendment here is

14

the exact same thing as the First Amendment.

used that example that Justice Scalia gave, or that

general example.

very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a

powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us.

different circumstances than that one.

6

don't understand that if you can freeze the assets

I just

You may have ­­ may have statutory

11

arguments, you ­­ but if you have arguments, it has

12

nothing to do with the constitutional right to counsel.

13

MR. SREBNICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

14

has everything to do with the Sixth Amendment because,

15

at its inception, the Sixth Amendment only encompassed

16

the right to spend one ­­ one's own money to be

17

represented by counsel.

18

appointment of counsel.

There was no right to the

19

So taking away the defendant's lawfully held

20

assets, whether it be their pension funds, whether it be

21

an inheritance, whether it be their lawfully earned

22

labors, to take that away at the inception of this

23

nation would have meant the defendant would have been

24

left with no counsel at all since the notion of an

25

appointed lawyer is really a notion of more recent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

vintage, in the 20th century.

2

So indeed, to take away the property rights,

3

pretrial, of a defendant, at the time when he or she is

4

under indictment, needs those assets to retain counsel,

5

any private counsel ­­ so we're not talking in this case

6

about a particular ­­

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what if ­­ what if

8

the prosecution brings a case for crime X and wins that

9

case, and it imposes a fine that takes away all of the

10

defendant's assets, and then the prosecution brings

11

another case for crime Y, would you be arguing that the

12

fine had to make an exception for the defense of

13

crime Y?

14

MR. SREBNICK:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. SREBNICK:

No, Justice Scalia.
What's the difference?
There's a judgment.

Upon

17

judgment, a defendant can lose his right to property

18

upon execution of that judgment.

19

could execute on that criminal judgment and take as much

20

of the defendant's assets needed to satisfy the fine.

21

So the government

Our objection is to the government doing it

22

before conviction, before there's been any judgment.

degree are interrelated, of course, because without

So while the Court has accommodated the

is not a license for the government to render people who

20

are not indigent, indigent.

the only standard we would ask for, that they be

I should add that while we are having a ­­

an academic discussion here, it didn't seem to be such a

controversial proposition to the government when in

came to the Court and said there was a difference

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think that the appropriate starting point

16

for this case is the last sentence of Monsanto, not

17

because Monsanto specifically addressed substitute

18

property, but because it adopted a principle that I

19

believe resolves this case.

20

Monsanto says, "If the government may, posttrial, forbid

21

the use of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then

22

surely no constitutional violation occurs when after

23

probable cause is adequately established, the government

24

obtains an order barring a defendant from frustrating

25

that end by dissipating his assets prior to trial."

And the last sentence of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that was said

2

in the context of the government's submission that

3

there's a difference between tainted and untainted,

4

right?

5

tainted aspects of the proceeds.

Your ­­ your argument in Monsanto focused on the

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, it did.

And that's why I

7

say that the principle that the court articulated in

8

that sentence is what decides this case.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why is that the principle?

10

The principle ­­ they're talking about money that

11

doesn't belong to the defendant.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well ­­
It belongs to Smith or

that the government, without proving that he's guilty of

money.

So ­­ now I can imagine ­­

MR. DREEBEN:

25

Justice Breyer, let me try to

explain ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

28

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can go from there and

find interests on both sides, da, da, da.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, I think that

4

it's important to start with, actually, the principle

5

that Monsanto adopted, not because it resolved the

6

factual circumstances here, but because it's talking

7

about the point in time after the government wins a

8

judgment.

9

will have a right to forfeit that property at the end ­­

And the principle is that if the government

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. DREEBEN:

12

­­ if it can show probable

cause ­­

13
14

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I ­­ I understood that.

I

just wanted to try it with the facts here.

15

I mean, the first principle is if, in fact,

16

the defendant has somebody else's money that he's taken

17

unlawfully, and he has to give it up at the end of the

18

trial, we can make him give it up at the beginning to

19

make sure it's there.

20

Now let's try it with the facts here.

If a

21

defendant has some money, which maybe he will have to

22

pay in a fine, what we'll do is we'll take all his money

23

away before he's been convicted beyond a reasonable

24

doubt.

25

propositions.

Okay.

That's the difference in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

And I'm saying it's pretty hard for me to

2

think in a country which says that before he's

3

convicted, you have to release him on bail except in

4

unusual circumstances, that nonetheless, you can take

5

all his money away so he can't hire a lawyer.

6

I know that's a little simpleminded, but

7

nonetheless, that seems fairly basic.

8

where it comes from.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't know

So Justice Breyer, I think

10

that the ­­ the embedded premise there is that people

11

will not suffer restraints on their liberty or property

12

before they have been convicted beyond a reasonable

13

doubt.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.

That is

15

the principle, and now we make a number of exceptions.

16

And one exception is if you think he's going to ­­ I

17

mean, I can think of exceptions where we do keep people

18

in jail.

19

what they're saying, I think, in essence is, let's try

20

and think of an exception for this one.

21

And anyway, if there is one, what he wants to use the

22

money for is to make sure he has a lawyer.

23

the Sixth Amendment.

24
25

That is, of course, right.

All right.

And ­­ and here,

Pretty hard.

Now, there we are.

It's called

That's where

I ­­ at this moment in my mind, that's where the case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

is.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

All right.

So can I try to

3

break that down a little bit?

4

the principle in Monsanto is critical.

5

Monsanto is that if the government will be able to

6

forfeit the property at the end of the day, it has an

7

interest in ensuring that it is available and not

8

dissipated.

9

It's asset flight.

10

Because I do think that
The principle in

It's the monetary equivalent of flight.

And this statute, Section 1345, was

11

specifically designed, as Justice Ginsburg observed, for

12

crimes in the banking and in the healthcare context in

13

which money flows into accounts, money is fungible, very

14

difficult to ­­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think ­­ I think that's

16

a ­­ what you say is, look, this is equivalent to the

17

case where we keep the guy in jail because he might run

18

away.

19

have on that on one side, and I have on the other side

20

that he'd like to have a lawyer which is a Sixth

21

Amendment right.

That's your point.

22

That's not a bad point.

So I

So I have a suggestion that I want you to

23

focus on.

24

in light of what you've said, that there is an interest

25

on your side and there is a constitutional amendment on

The suggestion is ­­ let's read this statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

the other side.

2

they accommodate those interests in this way?

3

Why can't we read this statute to say

If they're going to run away from ­­ with

4

the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin

5

the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted,

6

then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the

7

prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also

8

of property of equivalent value.

9

If I read that without knowing the

10

background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you

11

get TROs, where they're not precise because you don't

12

know exactly what property you're talking about.

13

what do you think about reading this statute to avoid

14

the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO?

15

And a TRO means where there's some property

16

out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the

MR. DREEBEN:

I get a chance to say both of them.
First, I don't think that it is a serious

2

really think that there's a serious avoidance concern

3

here.

4

has shown adequately that it will be able to forfeit the

5

money at the conclusion of the case, the Sixth Amendment

6

doesn't override the government's interests.

Monsanto basically said that if the government

11

judgment that the government can't come in in every case

12

13

But it does have a statute in a very specific area that

14

allows it to ­­

And Congress made a

But what is it that

the indictment.

15

again, I think that Monsanto resolved this question by

16

saying that if the government can take title to the

property at the conclusion of the case, it has an

interest in ensuring that it is available, and the Sixth

MR. DREEBEN:

I want to know what your

6

MR. DREEBEN:

My second response is that

7

this a statute that contains two basic provisions.

8

think petitioner describes it accurately.

9

I

Section (a) describes the things the

10

government can seek under the statute; Subsection (B)

11

describes the procedure that's used.

12

Subsection (A) first allows the government

13

to get an injunction against fraud in (A)(1).

14

it allows it to restrain assets as the ultimate object

15

of the suit, not as a temporary interim measure.

16

In (A)(2)

Temporary interim measures are described in

17

Subsection (B) where it specifically allows the Court to

18

impose various restraints until the Court has concluded

19

the proceeding.

20

(B).

21

So it addresses temporary relief in

Subsection (A)(2) describes the things that

22

the government can seek as the ultimate object of the

23

case.

7

They will flow into an
It's

So Congress obviated the need to do that by
saying you can restrain the defendant, but we're not

10

going to rely only on restraining the defendant.

You

11

can also restrain the banks where the funds are.

And

12

you can restrain them not only in the amounts that

13

represent the tainted funds, but represent the monetary

14

equivalent of them.

15

So in a sense ­­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17
18

I don't ­­ go ahead and

finish.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think, in a sense,

19

this statute negates the premise that there is a clean

20

line between tainted funds and untainted funds.

21

money is fungible once it's received by the defendant.

22

The

There is Medicare fraud if the government

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm ­­ I'm troubled by this

in the cert petition, and I don't know whether it can be

6

brought in with the Doctrine of Constitutional

there's any Sixth Amendment issue in the case.

relief, then ­­ which I understand to be your

14

argument ­­ then I don't understand what (a)

15

contributes.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

So (a)(2) has two different

this?

13

14

I mean, that is ­­ goes ­­ it seems to me

15

that's what it says ­­ any other person from taking

16

property of equivalent value, and he hasn't been

17

convicted of anything.

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, but it's ­­ it's

referring, again, to a person who has ­­ there is

20

probable cause to believe has obtained money as a result

of a criminal violation, and then it provides a

22

mechanism for restraining it.

24

unless they're holding the defendant's money.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not aimed at

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DREEBEN:

The money he

6

economically pure.

7

Mr. Srebnick made to distinguish them, and I realize

8

there may be members of the Court who think this is not

9

a very good argument, and maybe the question is whether

Now, the ­­ the only argument that

10

Monsanto is at root problematic, but at least insofar as

11

that argument goes, it's based on a reading of the

12

relation­backed doctrine that's contrary to this Court's

13

cases.

14

Monsanto itself made this very clear.

It

15

said that the government can restrain money that will

16

become the government's property at the conclusion of

17

the case.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, you're

19

taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its

20

nature, was limited to tainted funds.

21

22

to come in and take untainted funds.

23

the tainted funds concept was, you can't spend another

24

person's money.

25

can't spend that money because it belongs to someone

This is the first

4

money that ­­ or the property that he bought before this

5

crime, this untainted property becomes yours.

6

until that moment, the judgment, that the property is

7

forfeitable.

It really doesn't belong to you.

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

beforehand.

But it's not

It's not

That's true.
You can't forfeit it

So now the issue is ­­
MR. DREEBEN:

That's true for all ­­ that's

true or all money, tainted and untainted.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but ­­ but still

14

the question becomes, is there a substantive difference,

15

and I think Justice Breyer is expressing ­­ the problem

16

with this, as Justice Kagan said, this intuitive sense,

17

which is where do we draw this line?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

So ­­
Does the right to

counsel have any meaning anymore?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think it does.
Frankly, I expect within

23

three to five years, if we rule in your favor, 853 will

24

be changed to have this same language.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

So 853, Justice Sotomayor,

Alderson Reporting Company

does permit forfeiture of substitute property.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, but not pretrial.

Not ­­ not pretrial.

This

4

statute is different because it has a different function

and a different purpose.

forfeiture is punishing the defendant by taking money

property if the tainted property is gone.

policy behind it.

But the basic concept of

That's the

It is true ­­
Every judgment gives you

a right to substitute property of some sort.

them, but the ­­ I don't think the property right is

really the essence of what's going on here.

21

The government has a property right in each of

The fact that Section 853 permits pretrial

22

restraint of tainted property, but it doesn't reference

23

the subsection that deals with substitute property, is a

24

feature of that statute, but I think that has nothing to

25

do with the underlying point, which is that if the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

government is going to be able to collect on its

2

forfeiture judgment, sometimes it will need to restrain

3

property.

4

that saying that the defendant has a interest in paying

for counsel trumps the government's interest in being

6

made whole at the conclusion of the case.

Monsanto recognizes that, and I don't think

9

Mr. Dreeben ­­
When did the ­­ when did

the ­­ when was the first statute that allowed the

10

government to restrain the expenditure of tainted funds?

11

Does that go back a long time or ­­

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the ­­ the whole history

13

of in personam forfeiture was dormant until 1970, and

14

then Congress passed a statute that permitted this kind

15

of activity.

16

defects in the pretrial restraint of assets.

17

It improved the statute in 1984 to remedy

So it was relatively recently developed,

18

targeting basically drug conspiracies and organized

19

criminal activity.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And ­­ and the first time

21

that Congress ever applied it to non­tainted property

22

was what year?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the substitute assets

24

provision was added to the ­­ the basic forfeiture

25

statute, and it was there at least by 1984.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think

48

2

that it may have been earlier as well.
This provision is different, as Justice

3

Sotomayor pointed out, from the basic forfeiture statute

4

in permitting pretrial restraint of any assets, but I

5

think that it reflects the same basic underlying idea.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that ­­
And ­­ but just ­­ just to

8

be clear, so that I understood your earlier answer, the

9

consequence, the necessary consequence of your position

10

is that any State in the union can provide for

11

forfeiture or a freeze ­­ a freeze of assets pending

12

trial in any assault and battery case, spousal abuse

13

case, criminal negligence, date rape cases in order to

14

make the victim whole, to pay for medical costs, to pay

if the consequences of that is that in most of those

cases most people cannot afford counsel.

So
This

purposes of the fines that are at issue.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have you seen ­­ have you

20

21

mean, it isn't too tough in cases involving fraud on the

market to find judgments of tens or hundreds of millions

of dollars, I mean, judgments in fines after

24

convictions, and that's what, I think, the question is.

25

The principle of constitutional law that

Alderson Reporting Company

I

you're advocating would, in fact, permit the freezing of

what might be paid afterwards in a fine which could be a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dreeben, you're

saying that your ­­ your view, your interpretation, your

10

reading of the statute is the only tenable one, but if

11

one took the view that Justice Breyer's interpretation,

12

that restraining order means a temporary restraining

13

order, or it was another interpretation put forth in the

14

Americans for Forfeiture Reform brief, because if ­­ if

15

a judge were to take the position that all of ­­ all

16

three are plausible readings of the statute, but we'll

17

pick the one that allows the defendant to have counsel.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

So Justice Ginsburg, we don't

19

think that any of the alternative readings are

20

plausible.

21

Breyer, this statute doesn't limit the restraining order

22

to temporary relief, nor would it make any logical sense

23

to do that because the purpose of this statute was to

24

preserve funds so that they would be available at the

25

conclusion of the case.

For the reasons that I explained to Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

I also think that the amicus argument is not

2

a tenable one because it simply reads "or equivalent

3

value" out of the statute and without any reference to

4

the context of the statute, which is to try to make the

5

government be able to be made whole at the conclusion of

6

a case if, in fact, it obtains a judgment given the very

7

difficult process of segregating out money in banking

8

and financial­type crimes.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dreeben, if I could go

10

back to Justice Alito's questions about your

11

interpretation of the statute, I think what Justice

12

Alito was suggesting was that (a)(2)(A) would be

13

completely subsumed by (a)(2)(B) on your interpretation,

14

and I don't think that you got around to answering that

question.

So I ­­ I think that that ­­

that is true.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, but the ­­ it's not that

this is a statute that anyone's reading gives off

provisions of fact because the (b) section, 1345(b)

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. SREBNICK:

5

I think all of us who heard the argument of

6

Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale when it was delivered in

7

1989 understood the line was drawn between tainted and

8

untainted assets.

9

defense bar had its druthers, was a line that was

altogether.

The government proposes now to

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't want to use up your

15

rebuttal time, but I do want to ask you two quick

16

questions about the statute.

17

First is:

Did you raise anything about this

18

in your cert petition?

19

way to limit this to the Sixth Amendment context?

20

And the second is:

MR. SREBNICK:

Is there a

The answer to the first

21

question is no.

22

constrained in the Eleventh Circuit by the

23

interpretation that had been given back in 1999, we

24

focused on the constitutional issue in order to suggest

25

to the Court that the doctrine of constitutional

avoidance should be triggered because there's a Sixth

2

Amendment problem.

3
4

The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that the
statute is ambiguous.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

You didn't say anything

6

about constitutional avoidance in your cert position,

7

did you?

8
9

MR. SREBNICK:

That is correct.

We argued

that the Constitution would be violated, and because

10

this Court, in its discretion and indeed in the Rumsfeld

11

vs. FAIR case, looks at a statute even if the

12

interpretation is offered at the merit stage by an

13

amicus, the Court has considered those competing

14

interpretations in order to avoid the constitutional

15

issue.

16

Justice Scalia, in response to your question

17

about property, it sure sounded to anyone who heard the

18

argument and read the opinions in Monsanto and Caplin &

19

Drysdale that it was much about property.

20

government, by invoking the taint theory, which does

21

date back to the founding of our nation, taints a

22

particular subject, and that is the tainted asset.

23

That's why it's called the taint theory.

24

counterintuitive to suggest that untainted assets should

25

be treated as tainted assets.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

It's

And because, as I used the word earlier,

2

there must be a coexistence between the taint theory and

3

the right to counsel of choice, Monsanto drew the line,

4

Caplin & Drysdale drew the line and said if the

5

government can establish that the asset is tainted, it

6

can be frozen.

7

Nothing about Monsanto, nothing about Caplin

8

& Drysdale, suggested that assets over which the

9

government has no present property interest, no

10

relation­backed theory, no taint theory to speak of, can
