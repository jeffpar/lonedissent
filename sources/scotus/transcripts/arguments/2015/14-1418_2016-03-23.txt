MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

The Little Sisters of the Poor and their

13

co­petitioners face a dilemma that the Religious Freedom

14

Restoration Act does not allow.

15

their religious beliefs and pay millions of dollars in

16

penalties, or they can take steps that they believe to

17

be religiously and morally objectionable, and that the

18

government deems necessary, for them to provide

19

contraception coverage through their health care plans.

20

They can adhere to

Now, the government concedes the sincerity

21

of these religious beliefs, but it attempts to recast

22

them as an objection to the very act of opting out or

23

objecting.

24

demonstrably not true.

25

And with all due respect, that is simply and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you explain to me

2

the analogy with military objectors during the war?

3

Many of them felt that ­­ genuine belief; they were

4

pacifists ­­ that if they registered as pacifists, that

5

that would mean other people would have to serve in

6

their lieu.

7

did go to jail, because of this belief.

8
9

They were going to jail, and many of them

Why is going to jail less burdensome or less
important than paying a financial penalty?

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, I ­­ I don't think it is,

Justice Sotomayor.

12

conscientious objector example in the draft context,

13

because I think the way to analyze a conscientious

14

objector case is to say that because they face jail

15

time, there's clearly a substantial burden.

16

you get to the second part of the analysis, and you

17

probably would insist on a conscientious objector

18

actually objecting.

between ­­

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's stop there.

Okay.
To the extent that a

conscientious objector's good faith belief is that if I

25

register, someone will serve in my lieu, what burden is

at it in terms of strict scrutiny, the government sends

out how many notices to people to come and serve?

5

makes a difference if it knows whether or not one person

6

is not going to show up?

road of what's the difference, why would that law

8

survive?

9

Meaning, if ­­ if you're looking

MR. CLEMENT:

Do you really think it

And if we're going down that

I think it would, because I

10

think it would be very difficult to administer that kind

11

of system if either you couldn't even know about the

12

objection or you couldn't take any steps on the

13

government's part to fill the spot.

14

But I think what's critical ­­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, then, isn't that

16

the same thing here?

17

who ­­ who's not eligible, or who's eligible to pay, how

18

does this system work?

19

If you don't know who can pay, or

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two things, Your Honor.

20

One, this is perhaps the unique government program where

21

the government can provide an exemption without actually

22

requiring somebody to opt out, because that's exactly

23

what they do for the churches, for the integrated

24

auxiliaries, and the religious orders ­­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The churches have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

tell us that their church plans ­­ have to tell the

2

government their church plans.

3

government who's eligible or not eligible.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Somebody has to tell the

That ­­
How is that different

from military service?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, first of all, Your

8

Honor, that's just not true with respect to the

9

churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and the

10

religious orders that stick to their knitting and only

11

engage in religious activity.

12

that distinction.

13

So factually, there's

But I think the more important thing, Your

14

Honor, is I would distinguish between the situation

15

where somebody has an objection to opting out because

16

the government's going to take wholly independent steps

17

to find somebody to fill their spot, and a conscientious

18

objector who objects to objecting on a form where the

19

only way they can object is if they list the name of

20

somebody else who's draft­eligible who will then be

21

obligated to serve in their stead.

2

sure where that argument was taking us.

more into the specifics of it now, but could you just

begin again there, and ­­

MR. CLEMENT:

talking about?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

You're getting

I would be delighted ­­

delighted to do that, Justice Kennedy.

11

My point was simply that my clients do not

12

object to objecting.

13

that is they have not been shy about objecting.

14

told the government in the regulatory process that they

15

were making a mistake when they eliminated the true

16

exemption to religious orders to only those orders that

17

stuck to purely religious things.

18

Little Sisters could not go out because they serve the

19

elderly poor on a nondenominational basis.

20

they don't qualify for the exemption.

23

that was necessary to comply with this Court's interim

objection.

and says, I do object to objecting because objecting

will make it easier for the government to fill my slot.

that's part of my sincere religious belief.

10

have to say that that's a substantial burden, even if

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things, Justice Kagan.

13

First, it would only qualify as a substantial burden if

14

the objection requirement was enforced with massive

15

penalties.

16

it's ­­ but ­­

17

And that's a relatively rare situation, but

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Yes.

I mean, we have

18

the same penalties that we have here, and the person is

20

religious belief because that will make it more likely

21

that the government will be able to fill the slot and to

take efforts to, you know, to ­­ to provide

contraceptives.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

And that's part of the

I understand, Justice Kagan.

That brings me to the second part of my answer, which is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

I think the right way to understand that hypothetical ­­

2

and I was explaining to Justice Kennedy, it's just a

3

hypothetical.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's a hypothetical

5

that's directly implicated by your very theory of the

6

case, because your theory of the case says that

7

everything depends on a person coming in saying this is

8

against my religion, and that being the end­all and the

9

be­all.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think that's our

position.

12

religious beliefs.

13

They've conceded to them here.

14

analysis about the substantial burden, but the

15

substantial burden analysis in this case is very clear

16

because of these millions of dollars in penalties, the

17

exact same penalties that were issued in Hobby Lobby.

18

And the Court said it was an easy case on substantial

19

burden ­­

20
21
22

Our position is that ­­ the sincerity of the
The government can question them.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is a legal

You're just not answering

the question.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm trying ­­ I'm trying

23

to, with all due respect, which is that brings to ­­ if

24

you have everything else the same, that brings you to

25

the second part of the RFRA analysis.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I would think

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

if our objection, contrary to fact, were we absolutely

2

object to objecting, if you come in and the

3

government ­­ based on our objection, the government

4

provides the service through the Exchanges, through

5

Title X, through an Aetna uber­policy where everybody

6

gets their contraceptives, some overall government

7

policy, we, in fact, object to none of those things.

8

But if we did, I think we would lose under the second

9

half of the RFRA analysis, because I think that's the

10
11

right analysis.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if I understand that

12

answer, it's that if a person had a sincere religious

13

belief that objecting to objecting was a form of

14

complicity, then that would control, and you would have

15

to go to the second part of the analysis, which is to

16

say, is there a compelling interest test?

17

government's response been narrowly tailored?

18

essentially, the objecting ­­ the difference between

19

objecting to objecting and your clients' position is not

20

a difference at all with respect to the burden analysis.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Has the
But

Well, I do think my clients'

22

objection is distinguishable from the hypothetical,

23

because this is not an objecting to objecting.

24

maybe one way to understand this is, if there were, in

25

fact, two forms, one was an opt­out form, one was an

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

authorization form, my clients would have no objection

2

to signing the opt­out form.

3

an objection to the authorization form.

4

government ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They would very much have
And the

I guess what I'm saying, Mr.

6

Clement, is I understand the factual distinction that

7

you're making, but the factual distinction doesn't

8

matter given your own legal analysis.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think it does based on

10

this Court's precedents either, but even if I'm wrong

11

about that, you could certainly write an opinion that

12

says there are three legs to the stool in this case.

13

There is the fact that the government demands more than

14

an objection, the fact that it enforces it with massive

15

penalties, and the reality that if that happens, then

16

they are going to hijack our health plans and provide

17

the coverage against our will.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What I don't understand,

19

Mr. Clement, is when will any government law that

20

someone claims burdens their practice ever be

21

insubstantial?

22

before us, including the people in the military, are

23

saying that my soul will be damned in some way.

24

naysaying that that is a very substantial perceived

25

personal burden by them.

Because every believer that's ever come

I'm not

But if that's always going to

be substantial, how will we ever have a government that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Two things ­­
­­ that won't be a

problem?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things, Justice Sotomayor.

8

The first is that I do think that what you're saying

9

about the government not being able to function under

10

the substantial burden and then the least restrictive

11

alternative analysis, that's exactly what Justice Scalia

12

said for the Court in the Smith decision.

debate.

15

debate, but there is no question which side of the

16

debate settled things.

17

And Justice

And they had a healthy

And you can question who had the better of the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it's the side of

18

the debate that settles, which is if we are not asking

19

you to do anything except identify yourself, and if who

20

is going to do the action is either the government or a

21

third party, that that's the balance that we have

22

struck, that it's not a substantial burden if someone

23

else is going to do the act that you're objecting to.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Sotomayor, if the only

action involved is a third­party action like in part of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

the Bowen against Roy case or in the Lyng case, you're

2

right, that's not a substantial burden.

clear as I can about this.

6

just then, to know that we raise our hand and opt out.

insufficient when it comes to Petitioners' employees,

2

but the sum total of their showing in this case is

3

limited to less than one column of one page of the

4

Federal Register.

5

the government can demand that organizations like

6

Catholic Charities and the Little Sisters of the Poor

7

engage in conduct that all agree here they regard as

8

sinful.

9

That is simply insufficient before

Instead, what we have here is a religious

10

employer definition, that is, those organizations that

11

get the full­blown exemption as opposed to organizations

12

like the Petitioners here that gives a full­blown

13

exemption to organizations even if they don't object to

14

providing contraceptive coverage that treats identical

organizations differently where you've got a Catholic

school on the west side of town that has to comply.

once you have this category, the church, then any other

organization, religiously­oriented organization, has to

think that the problem is that the government has to

14

draw a definition that is coherent and that is rational.

15

And I think the problem here is they've drawn a

16

definition from the tax regime that doesn't comply when

17

you carry it over to this regime.

And ­­ and if you're saying that every time

20

Congress gives an exemption to churches and synagogues

21

and mosques, that they have to open that up to all

22

religious people, then the effect of that is that

23

Congress just decides not to give an exemption at all.

exemption to churches, that exemption has to apply to

all other religious organizations.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

exempt certain employers of certain size from Title VII,

discrimination is a bad thing, and it's not that we're

not committed to eradicating that problem, but because

10

entitled to some respect?

16

Why is that a judgment that is not

Because I think it means one

17

of two things:

18

tolerate all of the problems it identifies for

grandfathered plans ­­ and we understand that there are

about 44 million of those ­­ with respect to ­­ respect

25

Either the government is willing to

Either they're willing ­­ if they're willing

Alderson Reporting Company

interest in forcing these particular Petitioners to

issues here.

More generally, I think

that it says are sufficient to further its interests

seizing control of our plans, the plans that we are

objectionable coverage to our employees solely as long

does, then I could certainly see why many clients would

alternatives.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45
1

The accommodation that Petitioners challenge

2

in this case strikes precisely the sensible balance

3

between religious liberty and compelling governmental

4

interests that Congress sought when it enacted RFRA.

5

As this Court recognized in Hobby Lobby, the

6

accommodation seeks to respect the religious liberty of

7

Petitioners by exempting them from the contraceptive ­­

8

contraceptive requirement, and to respect the interest

9

of Petitioners' employees ­­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is it fair for me to

11

infer from the way you open your remarks that you

12

concede that there is a substantial burden here?

13

the question then is what is a permissible

14

accommodation?

15

alternative?

16
17
18

And

What's the least restrictive

Do you concede that there's a substantial
burden?

22

that in a case in which the ­­ an ­­ when a question is

23

this, when a religious objection is made to the

24

independent arrangements of the government makes with

25

third parties to fill a regulatory gap created by

Alderson Reporting Company

We ­­ we concede
We're not

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

granting an exemption from a ­­ a generally applicable

2

rule, that that qualifies as ­­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do ­­ do you

4

question their belief that they're complicit in the

5

moral wrong?

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, we do not.
Well, then ­­ then it

8

seems to me that that's a substantial burden.

9

­­ and the next question is whether there is an

10
11

And then

accommodation and whether that's the least restrictive.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, look, I'm ­­ I'm

12

happy to discuss the substantial burden further, but I

13

do want to go to what I think is the critical point on

14

the question of how RFRA scrutiny applies, if it does

15

apply, and it's this:

16

talking about the various alternatives that the

17

government might be able to use instead of the

18

accommodation, and I think there's a real problem with

19

every single one of them in that every single one of

20

them defeats the very purpose for which Congress imposed

21

the preventive services requirement, not just with

22

respect to contraception, but with respect to all

23

preventive services.

24

you can see this, if you look at the relevant statutory

25

provision, which you can find at Page 4(a) of the

Mr. Francisco spent a lot of time

And the point here, and I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

appendix to our brief, which is the preventive

2

services ­­ preventive services provision, the point

3

here of this provision is that a group health plan,

4

i.e., the health plan that covers people through their

5

employer, or individual health insurance coverage, i.e.,

6

the kind of coverage that's sold on the Exchanges, shall

7

include cost free all of the preventive services.

8
9

The whole point of this provision, the whole
point of it, was to ensure that people who got health

10

insurance would get the preventive services as part of

11

their regular care from their regular doctor with no

12

barriers.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's ­­ in other

14

words, your compelling interest is not that women obtain

15

the contraceptive services.

16

that women obtain the contraceptive services through the

17

insurance plan or the third­party administrator hired by

18

the Petitioners, hired by the Little Sisters.

Your compelling interest is

19

In other words, it seems to me you can't say

20

that what you're trying to do is make sure everybody has

21

this coverage.

22

through the program set up by the Little Sisters, and

23

that's what they object to.

24
25

You want to make sure they have it

GENERAL VERRILLI:
Your Honor.

Yes, I understand that,

But assuming for the moment ­­ and I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

happy to discuss substantial burden further ­­ but

2

assuming for the moment that we are in RFRA scrutiny

3

because there is a substantial burden, the point I'm

4

making here, and I do think this is critical, is that

5

the ­­ none of these options that the Petitioners have

6

identified going out on the Exchange and buying a

7

separate individual policy, a contraceptive coverage

8

only policy, Title X, Medicare, Medicaid, with respect

9

to every one of them, you'd have to change the law to

10

make them even eligible here.

11

change the law, every single one of them creates the

12

very problem that Congress was trying to solve in this

13

provision because it would require setting up a one­off

14

jerry­rigged separate channel to get contraceptive

15

coverage.

16

But even if you could

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The point is that

17

it's the form in which the services are provided that

18

you object to, not the fact that they be provided or

19

not, because that's not the question.

20

the Petitioner has used the phrase "hijacking," and it

21

seems to me that that's an accurate description of what

22

the government wants to do.

23

mechanism that the Little Sisters and the other

24

Petitioners have set up to provide services because they

25

want the coverage to be seamless.

In other words,

They want to use the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

Now, maybe that's a sufficiently compelling

2

government interest, the form in which the services are

3

provided, but the interest is not whether or not women

4

receive contraceptive services.

5

object to the fact that the people who work for them

6

will have these services provided.

7

having them provided through the mechanism that they

8

have set up because they think, you know, whether you or

9

I or anybody else thinks, they think that that

10

They object to

complicity is sinful.

11
12

The Petitioners do not

GENERAL VERRILLI:
Chief Justice.

13

I understand that, Mr.

I understand that that's their position.

Let me engage with you on the question of

14

whether that constitutes a substantial burden.

15

that it doesn't constitute a substantial burden because

16

the way that this accommodation is structured, although

17

you're quite right, it seeks from the perspective of the

18

employee to ensure that the employee gets the protection

19

that Congress designed, that from the perspective of the

20

employer, that this is provided through a separate

21

program.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you're saying, don't

23

worry, religions, you're not complicit.

24

you're saying?

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

We think

No.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's what

We're saying that

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50
1

the judgment about complicity is up to you, but that

2

there is an objective limit that RFRA recognizes on the

3

scope of what is a cognizable burden, that that was true

4

in the pre­Smith case law before RFRA, and it was

5

recognized in Lyng and in Bowen, and those are cases in

6

which there was no doubt ­­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me then the

8

analysis has to be whether or not there are less

9

restrictive alternatives and if ­­ is this the least

10

restrictive alternative?

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, as I said, Your

12

Honor, if RFRA scrutiny applies, then this certainly is

13

the least restrictive alternative.

them.

of the Exchanges.

of those who provide services under self­insured plans.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But the whole point here,

7

Justice Alito, is that Congress wanted to eliminate ­­

8

even what were perceived by most of the small barriers,

9

like a 5 or $10 co­pay, because the medical experts said

10

that even though small barriers ­­ even when you're

11

getting it as part of your regular coverage, even those

12

small barriers work as a sufficient disincentive that

13

many fewer people use contraception than would

14

otherwise, and that ­­ and the barrier ­­ and the system

that Your Honor is positing, imposes a significantly

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

What was the reason why Congress did not require

contraceptive coverage right away under the

grandfathered plans?

under the grandfathered plans for 25­year­olds so that

they could get coverage under their parents' health

administrative difficulty for the grandfathered plans to

put in contraceptive coverage, preventive care coverage

20

right away, just as they did for the 25­year­olds.

21

yet Congress said, for the really important things, like

22

covering the 25­year­old graduate student, yes, you have

23

to do that right away.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Your Honor, when Congress

3

passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it made ­­

4

it didn't impose an immediate requirement that every

5

building be retrofitted so that access to the disabled

6

was possible.

7

where it's feasible to do so, buildings shall retrofit,

8

and then new buildings shall have these access

9

requirements.

What it said was, in that context, that

No one would say that the government

10

lacks a compelling interest in enforcing the Americans

11

transitional system.

13

This was a big program.

There were reliance

the difference.

about the Americans with Disabilities Act, that

15

It can be very expensive to retrofit

But are you saying that the burden of simply

16

instituting coverage for preventive care as it was done

17

for coverage for 25­year­olds is comparable to making

18

architectural changes?

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

But what I'm saying,

20

Your Honor, is that this is ­­ unlike the exemption for

21

small employees under Title VII, which exempts 17

22

million people from these fundamental protections

23

against race and gender and religious discrimination,

24

and does so permanently, this is a transitional device

25

where over time you're going to get down to a situation

where virtually nobody has ­­ is in the situation, being

2

in a grandfathered plan, and most of them are getting

think it undermines a compelling interest one bit.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I don't

General, can we go back

6

to the substantial burden question?

Justice Breyer has been talking about how to draw this

8

line.

accommodate, and when doesn't it have to act to

And I think that

When is it that government has to act to

10

accommodate?

11

line that at least to me helps draw some clarity to the

12

cases, our cases, which is, if what your religious

13

belief is asking the government to do is to change its

14

behavior with respect ­­ its regulatory behavior with

15

respect to others, then it can't be a substantial

16

burden, because we live in a pluralistic society in

which government has to function.

There is some amici that have suggested a

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, Your Honor,

Alderson Reporting Company

2

that's ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because here, what the

3

religious groups I understand are asking is the

4

government not to use its regulatory power with third

5

parties who don't have a religious objection, and

6

forcing a burden on the women who its trying to help,

7

third parties that don't have the same religious

8

objection, and burdening them to do other things.

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think that is the

10

essence of our position on substantial burden, Your

11

Honor, and I believe that trying to answer Justice

12

Breyer's question about where that comes from, I believe

13

it comes from Lyng and Bowen, which both recognize that

14

there is an objective limit in Lung.

15

For example, the Court said that the ­­ it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is ­­ this is

20

not just a case of the government dealing with a third

21

party based on the Petitioners' objection.

22

objection is that the government is hijacking their

23

process, their insurance company, their third­party

24

administrator that they have hired and set up to provide

25

these services.

The

I understand the distinction between

Alderson Reporting Company

59
1

yes, you can do what you want, but you can't compel

2

other people to take actions that are consistent with

3

your religious beliefs.

4

But that's not what's going on here.

It is

5

the relationship between the insurer that the Little

6

Sisters have hired or the third­party administrator with

7

respect to other ­­ other entities that is being used by

8

the government to provide these services.

9

a third party that's being compelled.

It's not just

They want ­­ it's

10

not just that they want third parties to take certain

11

action.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I would agree with you to

13

this limited extent, Mr. Chief Justice, that that's the

14

context in which the government action occurs here, that

15

the fact that the ­­ there is this relationship between

16

Petitioners and their employees is the occasion for

17

government acting.

18

critical, I think, and go to why we shouldn't consider

19

this to be a cognizable burden.

20

But there is two points that are

And the first one is that what we are doing

21

when we act here is trying to make an alternative

22

arrangement that comes as close as we can to ensuring

23

that the employees who may not share the Petitioner's

24

religious beliefs get what the law entitles them to

25

while at the same time ensuring that the employer does

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

60

not have any legal obligation to pay for the coverage,

2

to provide the coverage in any way.

3

that the ­­ the practical features of this are critical.

4

I mean, I think

The employer cannot be charged for the

co­pay, even insurance ­­ insurance plan, self­insured,

Mr.

were to conclude that with respect to substantial

We would be content if the Court

why we're fighting on it and not giving up on it.

for churches.

11

and said, well, the exemption ought to be extended to

us.

13

And then the religious nonprofits came in

The government made a judgment that as a

14

categorical matter, it wasn't willing to extend the

15

exemption to all religious nonprofits, as was requested,

16

but it, instead, would use this accommodation, which we

17

thought was the best way that we could both protect

18

their religious liberty and ­­

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The difference, of

20

course, is, as you ­­ it's properly phrased in the

21

briefing, is the accommodation is the way in which the

22

organizations comply with the mandate.

23

Catholic Charities of Erie, though, they don't have to

comply to the accommodation or any other way.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But ­­

With respect to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

They are exempt.

The reason we drew the

3

line is because we think ­­ and I think Professor

4

Laycock's brief is quite instructive on this point ­­ is

5

that while there ­­ no line is perfect, and I'm sure

6

this line isn't perfect, and there's going to be some

7

overlap between entities that maybe you think of ­­ or

look closer to being on one side of the line than the

9

other.

But the line is a valid line.

And it's a valid

10

line largely for the reasons Justice Kennedy identified

11

earlier, because in that category of religious

12

nonprofits may be some entities, like the one Your Honor

13

has identified, that appear very close to entities that

14

have an exemption.

15

of other entities whose connection to that core

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, for the employees who

No.

there ­­ it is an obstacle because you're forcing them

to purchase a second insurance policy.

part of their compensation is, of course, the health

insurance they're getting from their regular doctors.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And ­­ and that

That just underscores that

16

the church plans here, religious organization plans

17

here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they

18

deemed immoral.

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, Your Honor, I think

20

the answer to that is that they're not subsidizing it,

21

because the way in which this plan is structured, the

22

way in which the accommodation is structured, is that

23

they are not to ­­ employers are not to bear any

You couldn't do it under

current law, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the way

constitutional objections work is you might have to

change current law.

15

(Laughter.)

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But in this circumstance,

I think, you don't need to get to that question of

whether there is an obligation to change current law

because even if you did have a second contraceptive­only

policy available on an Exchange, that would be precisely

21

the kind of barrier that Congress is trying to

eliminate.

You have two policies instead of one policy.

That creates the disincentives.

that it's a question of who does the paperwork.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

point, Your Honor, is that Congress and the Institute of

impose a very significant obstacle with these kinds of

it's ­­ it is why the ­­ it is why the government's

interest is advanced in the ­­ in the least restrictive

manner, in the most effective manner.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is this right?

Is it that

12

the reason I get that you don't want to have the women

13

to have to ask for the coverage is because vast numbers

14

of women will, quite a few who have religious objections

15

won't, and then there will be that middle set of people

16

who are inertia bound.

17

bound, we can't say so what, because poor people who

18

don't object religiously, if they get the

19

contraceptives, that lowers the cost of health coverage

20

later on.

21

And since they are inertia

So the government has an interest in that.

22

And therefore, there is an interest of some kind in not

23

allowing a system ­­ in not having a system where the

inertia bound have to take initiative.

25

Have I got that right?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think that the ­­
All right.

Do I have the

other part right, which is this is not hijacking because

4

there is a Federal regulation that says the

infrastructure of the insurers' contraceptive­related

plan belongs to the insurer, not to the person who buys

7

the insurance?

8
9

Am I correct about that?

GENERAL VERRILLI:
all correct, Your Honor.

And that's all ­­ that's

And that's why when I say when

we make an arrangement with Aetna or Blue Cross, we are

not making an arrangement with Petitioners or anything

that Petitioners own.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Couldn't the Executive deal

14

with the problem of what's available on the Exchanges at

the present time in this way:

16

that provide comprehensive coverage.

17

Executive say, as a matter of our enforcement

discretion, we are not going to take any action against

insurers who offer contraceptive­only policies, and in

It's not just about filling out paperwork; that if

you're a woman employee, you go to your regular doctor,

21

you say you have a medical condition ­­ I ­­ that puts

interest to be avoiding complicity in what they consider

I think RFRA cuts, in

this situation, quite decisively in favor of the

government here because the interests are compelling.

14

And the ­­ and as we've tried to explain, none of the

15

alternatives that the Petitioners have proposed have

16

come anywhere close to being equally effective in

17

ensuring that women get this coverage.

get told by your regular doctor, I can't help you, I

20

can't even counsel you about this.

Can you

I think what

we've tried to ­­ the ­­ the way I've tried to explain

25

the Court recognized this in Hobby Lobby, that the goal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

82

of this is to exempt the employer from providing the

contraceptive coverage, to exempt them and to provide it

as separate means through separate funds without their

No.

You have got to pay for that policy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it is two policies

12

instead of one because the contraceptives are being

provided by government regulation.

14

seamlessness is that I think the woman doesn't have to

15

apply and pay separately or something else.

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The only

Well, I think ­­ I think

17

if it's a separate policy, you're going to have to apply

and pay separately.

19

There is a whole separate regime.

I do want to make one point about the

20

notice, because my friend on the other side raised the

21

idea of notice, that it's not just about us using the

22

plan, but the notice they provide.

23

argument, I think, can't constitute a substantial burden

24

because it's entirely derivative of the objection to us

25

setting up this third­party arrangement.

Alderson Reporting Company

That notice

And I ­­ I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

84
1

think Mr. Clement told you that this morning because he

2

said if government didn't take this step of providing

3

the coverage, we would be happy to provide any

4

information they want on a form.

5

And so I think that ­­ what that tells you

6

is that the objection here, the focus of the objection,

7

is the ­­ is the arrangement to provide the separate

8

coverage and not the notice, per se; that on its own

9

terms, it's unobjectionable.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Before you sit down, General

11

Verrilli, could I just ask you this informational

12

question about this particular situation of the Little

13

Sisters?

14

Their regular third­party administrator also

15

will not provide ­­ has said it will not provide the

16

coverage if ­­ even if they were to comply with the ­­

17

the form of the notice requirement.

18

say they probably cannot be ­­ there is probably no way

19

under ERISA to obtain contraceptive coverage for their

20

employees unless you can find another third­party

21

administrator that you could deal with there.

22
23
24
25

And, therefore, you

In that situation, would the Little Sisters
still be subject to fines for failing to comply?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, we don't think so.

If I could, just in closing, what I'd ask this Court to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

85
1

do is to weigh the alternatives that have been put

2

before you here on this case.

3

got a serious, thoughtful effort to respect Petitioners'

4

religious beliefs by creating a system that allows them

5

to exempt themselves from the requirement in a

6

straightforward manner and that protects the fundamental

7

rights and liberties and dignity of the ­­ of their

8

employees, many of whom may not share their religious

9

beliefs about contraception.

10

On the one side, you've

On the other side of the scale, what you've

11

got is a demand that those rights or those employees who

12

may not share Petitioners' beliefs be extinguished ­­

13

extinguished until such time as Congress creates and

14

enacts a different program that will require a separate

15

one­off jerry­rigged channel for them to provide and

16

obtain contraceptive coverage that will impose precisely

17

the burdens that Congress said in the relevant statutory

18

provision are unacceptable for all preventive services.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's one way of

20

characterizing what's involved here.

21

also ­­ it can also be said that, and it is true, that

22

this is a case in which a great array of religious

23

groups ­­ and it's not just Catholics and Baptists and

24

Evangelicals, but Orthodox Jews, Muslim groups, the

Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, an

2

said that this presents an unprecedented threat to

3

religious liberty in this country.

4

What would you say to that?

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

What I would say to that,

6

Your Honor, is that, I think, essentially what eight

court of appeals have said, which is that RFRA requires

8

a sensible balance.

9

Their original justification for the line

they drew, Justice Kennedy, was that the exempted

co­religionists and, therefore, less likely to have

employees who would use the products.

Now as to the exemptions, I mean, I will
respectfully disagree with Professor Laycock.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would it have been

20

better to say, churches, you've got to tell us you're

21

going to claim an exemption, because not every church is

religious, has the same religious tenets.

it's clear to tell what a church is.

MR. CLEMENT:

Others may be special like them, but

Let me answer both questions

together.

limited to churches.

7

And if my clients would have just stuck to their

8

knitting and not helped the elderly poor, they could

9

qualify.

10

First of all, the exemption is not just
It applies to religious orders.

But to answer both of these questions

11

together, not all exemptions are created equal.

Professor Laycock is a great scholar, but even he

He didn't get into that.

And

He left it

16

And I think he subsequently said that if

17

there really was a requirement for these entities to

contract, and there is, then even he would recognize

19

there is a substantial burden.

One of the cases that Congress clearly

12

wanted to embrace in RFRA was Yoder.

13

Yoder was a relatively hard case because there basically

14

were no exemptions.

15

already provided an exemption for the Mennonites and it
