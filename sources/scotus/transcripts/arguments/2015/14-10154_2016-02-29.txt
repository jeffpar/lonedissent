ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA G. VILLA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,

9

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

10
11

MS. VILLA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

There are three reasons to exclude reckless

13

misdemeanors from the phrase "use... of physical force"

14

as occurs in 921(a)(33).

15

The first is that it's consistent with the

16

definition of use that this Court has implemented in

17

other cases.

18

common­law definition of battery.

19

consistent with the intentionality inherent in domestic

20

violence.

21

Second, it is consistent with the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And, third, it is

But it's inconsistent

22

with the treatment of bodily injury.

23

you agree, because the Court so held, that either bodily

24

injury or offensive touching is the act ­­ satisfies the

25

act requirement.

I mean, I think

And you say if there's bodily injury,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

then reckless is enough, but if it's only offensive

2

touching, then you need a higher mental state,

3

intentional or knowing?

4

qualify equally, why shouldn't the same state of mind

5

attach to each?

6

MS. VILLA:

Why ­­ if ­­ if both acts

The same state of mind should

7

attach to each, and that is why intentionality is the

8

state of mind that under the common law can attach to

9

each.

Because intentional battery covered both the

10

offensive physical contact as well as the physical

11

injury, whereas recklessness covers only bodily injury.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

13

Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you

14

think ­­ you're talking about intentionality as the act

15

of causing the injury.

16

battery to be the intentional act that causes the

17

injury; i.e., if a husband threw a bottle at a wife,

18

doesn't intend to hit her, but the bottle smashes

19

against the wall and the glass embeds itself in her

20

face, under the common law that would have been a

21

battery because the act, the intentional act, was to

22

throw the bottle.

23

injury, but the act caused the injury.

24
25

It wasn't ­­ it wasn't to cause the

MS. VILLA:
Honor.

But I understood common­law

I respectfully disagree, Your

Under ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know.

If we end up

2

disagreeing because the government points to many

3

examples where this is the case, how do you win?

4

MS. VILLA:

That's only on injury cases, and

5

so you don't have that same confirmation or that same

6

organization of the law with respect to offensive

7

physical contact.

8

offensive physical contact under a ­­ under the

9

categorical approach.

And so my clients were convicted of

And so at that point, you can't

10

say that they were convicted of anything that caused

11

physical injury.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But ­­ but the point is

13

that the contact was in ­­ was ­­ some contact had to

14

have occurred.

15

MS. VILLA:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
The question is whether

17

there was an act that caused that contact regardless of

18

whether it was intentional or reckless.

19

MS. VILLA:

The problem under the common law

20

is that not all touches were considered to be illegal.

21

And so that is why in Johnson, this Court stated the

22

common law as being the intentional application of

23

unlawful force.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we were talking

about common­law battery as it applied to ­­ definition

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

as it applied in a domestic setting.

2

only about a domestic setting ­­

3

MS. VILLA:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MS. VILLA:

So I'm talking

This ­­
­­ which this is.

This is serious but the problem

6

is, is that the government's formulation of any reckless

7

conduct satisfying use of physical force is that it's

8

not limited to batteries.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the mens rea of

10

recklessness could apply to the act of touching or to

11

whether the act is offensive.

Now, under Maine law, to

12

which of those does it apply?

It doesn't necessarily

13

have to apply to both.

14

MS. VILLA:

15

Statutorily it does apply to

both.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if someone recklessly

17

touches another person and that is offensive, that's a

18

battery under Maine law?

19

MS. VILLA:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the

20

government cites a case exactly for that ­­ proposition,

21

and that's the Gantnier case.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what happened in that

case?
MS. VILLA:

It was whether the defendant got

a ­­ an instruction on the simple battery rather than

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

the sexual offensive contact, and so that the Court

2

reversed it because it said that it was a proper

3

instruction.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

facts?

6

reckless touching?

7

No, I mean what were the

What did this person do that was ­­ involved a

MS. VILLA:

He went to wake in ­­ his

8

stepdaughter, I believe, who was asleep on a couch,

9

reached underneath a blanket and ­­ to shake her awake,

10
11

and touched her naked body.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that ­­ that seems

12

like the recklessness there goes to the ­­ the offensive

13

nature of the touching, not to the touching itself.

14

MS. VILLA:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
In other words, there's the

16

act of touching, so he ­­ he went to shake her but he

17

didn't intend to touch her?

18

MS. VILLA:

It was ­­ there can be

19

recklessness as to result or recklessness as to

20

circumstance.

21

as to circumstance by reaching underneath.

22

touched her on top of clothing, it would not have been

23

the same offense that could have been charged.

24

it was the fact that he touched her naked body and could

25

not see that she was naked.

And so that is an example of recklessness

Alderson Reporting Company

If he had

And so

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

the ­­ the answer.

3

all?

I don't really understand

He didn't intend to touch her at

That was his intent?

4

MS. VILLA:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, he did intend to touch her.
Okay.

Well, that's what I'm

6

saying.

7

the person intend to touch ­­ does the person intend to

8

touch in an offensive way?

9

They are two different things.

MS. VILLA:

10

Did the ­­ does

Correct.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so then it seems like

11

your answer to my question is that it is in the latter

12

that has the mens rea of recklessness.

13

MS. VILLA:

Under the Maine statute, it is

14

the latter that has the mens rea of recklessness.

15

the common law, it is the intent to have unlawful

16

contact.

17

which is why you can't just have an intent to touch.

18

You also have to have an intent to touch unlawfully.

And so that is why not all touches qualify,

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can I ­­
What is it that indicates

21

that the Federal statute tracks the common law?

22

Federal statute gives its own definition.

23

Under

MS. VILLA:

The

Your Honor, the Federal statute

24

25

of Castleman having adopted the common law for purposes

of force.

2

are not construing the common law here.

3

construing the phrase "use... of physical force."

4

the problem with the government's case is that that use

5

of physical force can occur in reckless driving context.

6

If I am driving a car and I have a family member that

7

qualifies under 922 ­­ 921(a)(33) in with me and I get

8

into an accident due to reckless conduct, that would

9

qualify as a predicate under this statute according to

But Your Honor is absolutely correct, that we

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Villa, can I understand

12

what you said?

13

not on the common­law history but on the ­­ the ­­ just

14

the language, "use... of physical force" and what that

15

means, the ordinary meaning of those words, is that

16

correct?

17

You said you're relying primarily, then,

MS. VILLA:

The Court has to deal with the

18

ordinary meaning of those words.

19

from the common law, it can take from many places, but

20

the ordinary mean of use is to carry out an action or

21

purpose by means of.

The Court can take ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why isn't ­­ any of

23

these examples that people give about the reckless

behavior?

5

the Sykes case that a car is ­­ is an instrument of

6

force when used recklessly in that way.

7

all of these kinds of examples consistent with the

8

ordinary meaning of use of force?

You say, well, I have a better example.

9

MS. VILLA:

It's

But, of course, we've said a

So why aren't

There's a substantive

10

difference, though, between driving recklessly and not

11

intending to harm the person that is with you in the car

12

and throwing an object at a person.

13

example of throwing an object at a person is that

14

intentional use of force against that other person.

That defendant can testify all day and all night that I

16

didn't intend to ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so, really, the

21

that's the ­­ that's the term that has to be interpreted

here, is the "use... of physical force."

23

MS. VILLA:

And

But the Court has said, with all

purpose by means of force.

Well, quite right.

But the

5

language ­­ I feel like I'm repeating myself a little,

6

so I'll just try it one more time.

7

the use of force.

8

whether that includes use of force that indeed is

9

carried out without an intent to harm, but is carried

The language is just

And what we are trying to decide is

10

out with an understanding that there is a risk of harm.

11

That's what recklessness is.

12

doing something like driving a car 200 miles an hour, or

13

throwing a plate, or slamming a door when somebody's

14

hand is in the vicinity, all of those things involve the

15

requisite risk and all of those things involve the use

16

of physical force.

17

MS. VILLA:

And ­­ and, you know,

But not in the sense that the

18

Court has construed "use" in the past.

19

in ­­ for instance, in Smith, which was decided in 1993,

20

that case was where it was "to carry out an action or

21

purpose by means of."

22

action, to close a door, by means of hurting somebody.

23

And so there is this disconnect, and that is inherent

24

because in the ­­ in recklessness, because what you're

doing is that you aren't looking to hurt it.

And so they have

And so it's not to carry out an

2

be a risk, but that's not your purpose.
And so the ­­ the whole difference between

3

purposeful, knowing behavior as opposed to reckless

4

behavior is ­­ is that you have a purpose that is

5

pointed someplace else with a risk that there might be a

6

collateral consequence, rather than actually seeking to

7

accomplish that collateral consequence.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Don't you have to look

at this in the domestic violence context?

Because the

10

definition, "use of force" as put in terms of a

11

misdemeanor under Federal or State triable law, means ­­

12

so it means a domestic violence.

13

prototypical in many of these domestic violence cases

14

where much of the violence employed is not direct

15

violence, not hitting some ­­ there's a lot of that, but

16

there's an awful lot of the examples I raised of

17

reckless conduct that leads to violence, either from

18

drunkenness or from other conditions.

19

You're using "use of force" as it's being

20

defined in other areas.

21

domestic violence case?

22

And isn't it

MS. VILLA:

Why does it fit into this

Because domestic violence,

23

according to the Castleman opinion was violence or

24

nonviolent conduct that's offensive, and is offensive ­­

That's the offensive

But it's a singular definition.

10

It's "use... of physical force."

11

or not, it is something that is intended to control

12

one's partner.

13

control one's partner, or you do something that is

14

offensive to control one's partner, it is still the idea

15

that you are implementing any level of force in order to

16

achieve an end, and that end is the control inherent in

17

domestic violence.

18

Whether it is touching

And so if you have to use force to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government tells us

19

that this is ­­ heavy consequences ride on this, that

20

is, that many domestic violence situations would not be

21

subject to prosecution under this statute on your read,

22

if you require knowing or intentional, rather than

23

reckless, state of mind.

24

MS. VILLA:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you agree with that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

MS. VILLA:

I don't necessarily agree with

2

that.

3

footnote 8, courts have generally construed "use... of

4

physical force" to exclude reckless conduct.

The reason I don't is because, as was noted in

5

And so there are ­­ for instance, in

6

Castleman itself, it falls in the Sixth Circuit.

7

Sixth Circuit in Portela held "use of physical force

8

excludes reckless conduct."

9

922(g), but I would note that the State prosecutor in

The

It was not construing

10

Castleman had a statute much like that in Maine that

11

disallowed knowing, purposeful, or reckless conduct.

12

And rather than charging all of them, that prosecutor

13

restricted it to "knowing purposeful conduct."

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that

15

prosecutors, when they are State prosecutors, when they

16

are charging these domestic violence offenses, are going

17

to be looking ahead to the consequences of the

18

particular charge for Federal firearms laws?

19

MS. VILLA:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21
22

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you think that's

realistic?
MS. VILLA:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that is

23

because there is a large part of the budget of ­­ for

24

domestic violence within the Federal government that

25

goes towards training and joint task force so that there

Alderson Reporting Company

for this purpose.

statute, and they do not want a person who has been

6

convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to

9

Okay?

MS. VILLA:

So Congress passes this

What was the year when that was

15

MS. VILLA:

yes, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

What reason is

17

there to think that when Congress did this, they wanted

18

common law battery only?

19

is defined in general by a great many States.

They didn't want battery as it

20

MS. VILLA:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because of the ­­
At ­­ at that time, am I

22

not ­­ is it not correct that by that time a majority of

23

the States had battery offenses that reached reckless

24

conduct?

25

MS. VILLA:

You are correct that many States

17

did.

2

Congress intended is that it did not adopt battery as

3

the definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

4

violence for purposes of ­­

But the problem with that scenario as to what

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I under ­­ I

in some sense falls within the definite ­­ falls within

8

the category of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence.

10
11

MS. VILLA:

I have to, because of the

Castleman so ruled.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, if you

13

agree with that ­­ and then your argument is that they

14

just ­­ all they think about across the street is the

15

common law.

16

don't care what the actual statutes are around the

17

country.

18

common law battery.

So battery ­­ common law battery, they

They are just interested in the offense of

19

MS. VILLA:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MS. VILLA:

Your Honor ­­
I mean, is that realistic?

Your Honor, that is not my

22

position.

23

offensive physical contact could only be accomplished

24

through intentional conduct.

25

My position is, is that common law battery,

The term "use" had been construed already by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

this Court prior to 1996 as being an affirmative,

2

purposeful conduct that you're taking an item and making

3

it your instrument, that you're accomplishing something

4

with that.

5

And in this case, it would have been force.
And so then if you accompany that with the

6

idea of domestic violence as the intentional controlling

7

of a domestic partner, all of those ideas, each one of

8

them has intentionality at its core.

9

And so that when Congress used this phrase

10

as an element, not as a ­­ a generic crime of battery,

11

but as an element of any misdemeanor crime, it is the

12

intentional use of physical force, because

13

intentionality use, as well as physical force and

14

domestic violence, all share that.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you're losing me.

16

thought you were argue ­­ I thought you were

17

acknowledging that reckless conduct would be sufficient

18

when it is ­­ when physical injury as opposed to

19

offensive touching is involved; is that right or not?

20

MS. VILLA:

Under the common law in about

21

the mid 1800s, there was a subset of batteries that did

22

adopt a negligent ­­ not a negligence, but a

23

recklessness factor.

24

given in Johnson, and it is not the definition ­­

25

I

But that is not the definition

Alito's question is, yes, that bodily injury does

It's the question I opened with.

If the ­­

bodily injury, why shouldn't the state of mind match?

10

Why shouldn't the same state of mind do for both bodily

injury and offensive touching?

about it, but it's not what they wrote.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ILANA H. EISENSTEIN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

Thank you, counsel.

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

14

This Court has twice interpreted

15

Section 922(g)(9) in Hazen and Castleman, and each time

16

concluded that Congress intended to keep guns away from

17

those convicted of assault and battery under generally

18

applicable State and Federal and Tribal law.

19

Petitioner attempts to distinguish between

20

offenses that cause bodily injury and those that involve

21

offensive touching.

22

in Castleman, that is a fallacy; that distinction is

23

elusive.

24

that prohibit the causation of bodily injury, even those

25

offenses may include offenses that are similar in terms

But as this Court already decided

And that's because States, including those

Official

2

was at issue at Castleman itself.

3

injury prong of the Tennessee statute, not the offensive

4

touching prong.

5

In fact, that was what
It was the bodily

And ­­ and in that case, the bodily injury

6

could be committed in a way that involved only slight

7

injury.

8

degree of force, batteries that qualify Section

9

922(g)(9) predicates.

10

And yet, this Court refused to distinguish, by

Keep in mind that States overwhelmingly

11

define battery as ­­ only as to the resulting injury.

12

Petitioners' role, which would limit misdemeanor crimes

13

of domestic violence to intentional conduct, would

14

require a prosecutor in those jurisdictions to prove in

15

the underlying offense not only that the contact and the

16

push, the hit, the grab was intentional, but that

17

prosecutor would also have to show that the abuser

18

intended the resulting injury in order to prove the

19

battery offense under the vast majority of State and

20

under Federal law.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What's so bad about

22

that?

23

should the accidental or perhaps you would say she ­­

24

you know, he or she knew that the person was close, why

25

should that constitute misdemeanor crime of domestic

I mean, given her door example, for example, why

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

violence?

2

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, in part because

3

Congress intended to cover batteries.

4

not only at common law, but also in modern ­­ under the

5

common and generic understanding of battery, define a

6

battery offense as ­­ only as to the causation of the

7

resulting harm.

8
9

And the way ­­

And keep in mind, reckless conduct ­­ and
petitioner avoids the fact of what reckless conduct is.

10

A reckless conduct is not an involuntary or a negligent,

11

or even an accidental act.

12

voluntary conduct.

13

chooses to act in conscious disregard of a substantial

14

and known risk of harm.

15

Reckless conduct is

It's conduct where an individual

So if the ­­ if the person in your example,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, slammed the door not realizing the

17

fingers were there, that's not going to be reckless

18

conduct at all.

19

That would be negligence at best.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, you

20

don't know; you're running away.

call?

22

close enough or she's close enough that this will, you

23

know, hurt his fingers or something.

24

that recklessness?

25

What if it's a close

which the ­­ the individual consciously disregards the

2

substantial ­­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

You don't

4

want to turn around and see how close the person chasing

5

you is, if you slam the door, oh, gosh, that's going to

6

pinch the fingers or something.

7

MS. EISENSTEIN:

But ­­ but I think that

8

the ­­ what feels wrong about the hypothetical is not

9

the ­­ the degree of intent of the act or ­­ it's the

10

extent to which that person may be justified in the door

11

slamming, which was that this was an act, perhaps, of

12

self­defense.

13

I think the more prototypical examples are

14

situations where ­­ that this Court highlighted in

15

Castleman, where an individual takes intentional action

16

to make contact with their loved one and does so in a

17

way that is reckless as to whether, for example, if

18

there's a push, reckless as to whether his wife simply

19

stumbles backwards or falls down and injures herself.

20

And that's the way States overwhelmingly frame their

21

assault and battery statutes.

22

And that's what ­­

20

indeed.

And the converse of that is striking.

While

I don't quite understand

You said, oh, well, it's narrow.

MS. EISENSTEIN:

But it's

I think it's a violation

18

under the meaning of general assault and battery, but I

19

also think that there's nothing wrong with ­­ as Justice

20

Kagan suggested, with treating that type of offense as

21

disqualifying.

22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're saying that the

example is covered by the statute.

24

MS. EISENSTEIN:

25

And I think, though, that to the extent to

Yes, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

which that raises a concern in terms of overbreadth, I

2

don't think this Court should be concerned about that,

3

because what Congress was worried about wasn't an

4

overbreadth of these prosecutions against family

5

members.

6

under prosecution and the low conviction rates of these

7

offenses.

8

And the whole reason why they extended the firearms ban

This was the problem that Congress addressed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Which of our ­­

11

which of our cases say that you don't have to worry if

12

the categorical approach covers conduct of the sort

13

Justice Kennedy was talking about because Congress meant

14

to cover other things?

15

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

16

that you're right that the categorical approach and its

17

strictures can cause real problems if there's any degree

18

of overbreadth in the statute.

19

in interpreting Section 922(g)(9) and what Congress's

20

purpose was is extremely important here.

21

extent to which Petitioner's view is adopted, which

22

would require only intentional conduct to qualify, any

23

degree of overbreadth such as Justice Kennedy's one

I'm not sure

4

So you think it's an appropriate defense

5

under a prosecution here that the type of conduct I was

6

charged with is really not what Congress had in mind?

7

Yes, it fits under the terms of the statute, but it's

8

not what Congress had in mind.

9

argument about that.

10

MS. EISENSTEIN:

And there's going to be

No, Your Honor.

The ­­ my

11

argument is the opposite, which is that this Court

12

should effectuate Congress's purpose by giving

13

Section 922(g)(9) the meaning that Congress intended,

14

which is to cover generally applicable assault and

15

battery statutes regardless of whether, on a rare

16

instance, they may end up covering an individual who was

17

recklessly driving and injured a family member.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I feel like your answer

19

was that the statute does cover it, but it's most

20

unlikely that a prosecutor would bring such a case.

21

think that's what you started to say about it.

22

MS. EISENSTEIN:

I

That's correct, Your Honor.

So in order to avoid a

JUSTICE THOMAS:

long is this suspension of the right to own a firearm?

5
6

I'm ­­ this is a ­­ how

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Your Honor, the right is

suspended indefinitely.

7

JUSTICE THOMAS:

Okay.

So can you think of

8

a First Amendment suspension or a suspension of a First

9

Amendment right that is permanent?

10

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Your Honor, it's not

11

necessarily permanent as to the individual, but it may

12

be permanent as to a particular harm.

13

decided to intervene at the first instance that an

14

individual is convicted of battering their family

15

members because it ­­ it relied on substantial and

16

well­documented evidence that those individuals pose

17

JUSTICE THOMAS:

And here Congress

So in each of these cases

19

had ­­ did any of the defendants, or in this case

MS. EISENSTEIN:

In neither case did they,

but these Petitioners ­­

JUSTICE THOMAS:

So that the ­­ again, the

24

suspension is not directly related to the use of the

25

weapon.

It is a suspension that is actually indirectly

2

member's involved in a misdemeanor violation; therefore,

3

a constitutional right is suspended.

4

MS. EISENSTEIN:

It's just a family

Yes, Your Honor, but I

5

believe that in terms of the ­­ the relationship between

6

Congress's decision to try to prevent domestic gun

7

violence and its means of doing so ­­

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE THOMAS:

Even if that ­­ if even if

that violence is unrelated to the use ­­ the possession
of a gun?
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

12

the studies that Congress relied upon in formulating

13

the ­­ the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ban

14

didn't ­­ were directly about the use of a gun because

15

what they showed is that individuals who have previously

16

been ­­ battered their spouses, pose up to a six­fold

17

greater risk of killing, by a gun, their family member.

18

JUSTICE THOMAS:

Well, let's ­­ let's say

19

that a publisher is reckless about the use of children,

20

and what could be considered indecent displays and that

21

that triggers a violation of, say, a hypothetical law

22

against the use of children in these ads, and let's say

23

it's a misdemeanor violation.

24

publisher's right to ever publish again?

25

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Could you suspend that

Your Honor, I don't think

you could suspend the right to ever publish again, but I

2

think that you could limit, for example, the manner and

3

means by which publisher ­­

4

JUSTICE THOMAS:

5
6

So how is that different

from suspending your Second Amendment right?
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I think that in

7

terms of a ­­ the compelling purpose that was identified

8

here, which was the prevention of gun violence and the

9

individual nature of the ­­ of the underlying offense,

10

so here this isn't a misdemeanor crime directed at any

11

person at large.

12

directed at members ­­ specified members of the ­­ of

13

that individual's family.

14
15
16

These are misdemeanor batteries

JUSTICE THOMAS:

Congress ­­
Would you have a better

case if this were a gun crime?
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I think it

17

would be perhaps a better case, except that the evidence

18

that Congress relied on and ­­ and that the courts below

19

that have addressed the Second Amendment concerns that

20

Your Honor is highlighting have even gone into a more

21

robust analysis of the ­­ the evidence that ties initial

22

crimes of battery to future gun violence.

23

is extremely strong.

24

was a recurring escalating offense.

25

That evidence

And Congress recognized that this

Petitioners are good examples of this.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

While they didn't reach, thankfully, the point where

2

they were able to reach for a firearm and were

3

prohibited from having a firearm under Federal law, they

4

have each been convicted multiple times of domestic

5

violence offenses and possess the firearms in close

6

proximity.

7

convictions and are suffering from that ban.

8
9

So these aren't individuals who had long­ago

Congress also contemplated exactly the
lifetime nature of the ban that Your Honor suggested and

10

left it in States' hands to resolve that by allowing

11

States to expunge or pardon convictions in cases where

12

an individual either petitions to do so or in some

13

States as a matter of course.

14

So ­­ so I understand Your Honor's concern

15

that ­­ that this is a potential infringement of

16

individual's Second Amendment rights, but I believe that

17

Congress has identified a compelling purpose and has

18

found a reasonable means of achieving that purpose.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I ­­ I suppose one answer

20

is ­­ just a partial answer to Justice Thomas's question

21

is SORNA, a violation of sexual offenders have to

22

register before they can travel in interstate commerce.

23

But that's not a prevention from traveling at all.

24

3

4

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do it ­­ what is it we

6

have ­­ they raised this in their brief.

7

let's focus on the cases in which there is a misdemeanor

8

battery conducted without an intentional or knowing

9

state of mind.

10

They say,

Now, they say if this, in fact, triggers ­­

11

this is the question Justice Thomas asked ­­ if this, in

12

fact, triggers a lifetime ban on the use of a gun, then

13

do we not have to decide something we haven't decided?

14

And I think it would be a major question.

15

What constitutes a reasonable regulation of

16

guns under the Second Amendment given Heller and the

17

other cases with which I disagreed?

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

But ­­

­­ the point is, she's

raised a question, and she wants us to answer that

question.

Stop you at the first

Your argument on the first point is that she did

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

4

MS. VILLA:

Your Honor, Congress did not use

5

the word "battery" in 921(a)(33).

is, is whether, under the rule of lenity, the Court can

7

then say battery is the standard that we are going to

use in order to construe this.

have to be a prior battery conviction.

11

misdemeanor conviction that has a state of recklessness

12

for the state of mind and results in any ­­ any

13

involvement of a domestic partner.

14

It could be any

And I think that there is enough play within

15

the statute ­­ statute itself, as well as the extent of

16

the common law, so ­­ to say that that is a reason for

17

applying the rule of lenity.

18

There is also the underlying constitutional

19

questions.

20

a constitutional right indefinitely based on reckless

21

conduct, I believe also presents extreme due process

22

concerns.

24

is best to avoid that question and to construe the

statute the way that is consistent with the words.
