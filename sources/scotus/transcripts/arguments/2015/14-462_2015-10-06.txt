ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The court below violated the Federal

11

Arbitration Act by refusing to enforce the parties'

12

arbitration agreement on grounds the Ninth Circuit

13

characterized as "nonsensical."

14

The agreement provides for individual

15

arbitration and expressly precludes class arbitration.

16

And just to underscore that point, it specifies that if

17

State law would force the parties into class

18

arbitration, then the entire arbitration agreement would

19

be unenforceable.

20

The court below interpreted the reference to

21

State law to mean inoperative State law preempted by the

22

FAA.

23

identified a single case in the history of California or

24

American law adopting that interpretation for any

25

contract.

But neither respondents nor the court below

Arbitration Act, have a responsibility to enforce the

scope of the Act, due regard must be given to the

19

22

But the key word there is "ordinarily,"

Because the Court in Volt went on to

It says, "In applying general State

where one lawyer or another will suddenly be saying, oh,

10

the interpretation of the contract here by the State

hostile to the act.

wouldn't ask the California Supreme Court because

9

that's one of the odd things about this case.

But even

10

if the California Supreme Court were to say, we as a

12

State ­­ a reference to State law means preempted or

think that's hard to imagine, but let's say they said

that, you as the Supreme Court of the United States

comports with the Federal policy of arbitration.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe that's so.

But if

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Landau, I completely

take your point as to what the parties must have wanted,

17

and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying,

fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the

way this contract was worded.

to word contract provisions like this so that there

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

There are two things

6

about that.

7

that kind of trailed off in your sentence is that the

8

Court has been very clear that ambiguities in the scope

9

of an arbitration agreement have to be construed in

The first is, Justice Kennedy, the language

10

favor of arbitration, and here's the reason.

11

is, if we know these parties have agreed to arbitrate ­­

12

this is in the first options.

13

if we know you and I have agreed to arbitrate so that

14

there's an arbitration agreement, we're going to assume

15

that all of the cases fall into the bucket of

16

arbitrability, and that's a fair common­sense

presumption.

18

And that

It's in lots of cases ­­

opinion for the Court in Granite Rock is that the

20

question of whether there's an enforceable arbitration

21

agreement at all is not ­­ is a State law question, not

22

a Federal law question, and here's the reason.

are two interpretive principles under the Federal

And the most important thing for you to

understand about the nature of this Section 9 in the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

same question that Justice Scalia asked ­­ I don't see

why it's better somehow to discriminate against

15

contract is improperly interpreted.

16

Here are the reasons:

But in

The first is that,

17

Justice Breyer, if you and I have a contract that says

18

if California law would prevent us from having a class

19

action waiver, we will not arbitrate at all.

20

not preempted.

21

Remember, all AT&T versus Concepcion is, is a rule that

22

says, if California forces us to engage in class action

23

arbitration.

24

all.

25

That is

That's the second holding of Volt.

But you and I can agree to anything at

This contract, when it says, "If the law of

Alderson Reporting Company

1

your State would find the class action waiver invalid"

2

is a perfectly fine thing for us to agree to.

3

State law and even accounts for preemption because the

4

FAA does not preempt California law in that

5

circumstance.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's

But does California have a

7

law, a valid law that would find the agreement to

8

dispense with class action unenforceable?

9

doesn't it?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does.
It does.

Does it or

It does.
In other words,

12

California now has a law that makes it okay to dispense

13

with class action procedures.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

In several respects.

The

15

first is there are several cases ­­ there are an array

16

of cases that aren't subject to the Federal Arbitration

17

Act.

18

that law, it is not preempted.

19

And the second is if you and I agree to follow

Let me also point to some other indicia

20

that's going to make it very hard for ­­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you have to agree with

22

Justice Breyer ­­ or do you not ­­ that California

23

interpreted this contract as saying if there is an

24

invalid State law that prohibits arbitration, then

25

that's binding on us.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

4

So remember, my point is this:

Okay.
That's what you're saying.
We don't, Your Honor.
If you and I

5

have a contract to follow that State law, which is this

6

is a contract, then it's not invalid because Concepcion

7

and preemption only apply when the State forces you to

8

do something.

9

But in all events ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, sure.

The parties can

10

do anything they want.

11

parties do what they want ­­ did the parties do that

12

here?

13

But the question is, did the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

And, Your Honor, my

14

problem is that that's going to be the question in every

15

case.

16

decision, then every time there's going to be a Federal

17

question about whether this is really what the parties

18

intended, that every time that the contract is ­­ is

19

ambiguous under State law.

And if we say we're going to reverse this

20

But I did have a couple of other things ­­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's one horrible, and

22

the horrible on the other side is if we ­­ if we agree

23

with you, the States can do whatever they want to ­­ to

24

invalidate arbitration agreements so long as they're

25

doing it under the guise of contract interpretation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Is

that not also a horrible?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is ­­ is a possible

3

horrible, Justice Scalia.

4

choice between the two of them.

5

that the latter is actually happening, and you do have

6

the backstop.

7

conclude that a State court is just making it up and

8

discriminating against arbitration, the FAA has a role

9

to play.

10

So let me just give you the
There is no evidence

And that is, we fully agree that if you

What I'm saying to you is that they do, in

11

truth, want a different legal rule, and that is, you've

12

got to construe these in favor of arbitration.

13

the principle that he's trying to derive from Volt, Your

14

Honor.

15

backstop that you and I are talking about.

16

That's

That's a whole other kettle of fish than the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we could see a

17

State court opinion that doesn't say anything that is

18

explicitly against arbitration, but it interprets a

19

contract in such a strange way that the only possible

20

explanation for the interpretation is hostility to

21

arbitration, can that be invalidated?

22
23
24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I think so, Your Honor.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that's the question.

And ­­

Does this case fall to that category?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

All right.

If that's what

2

the question is, because that is not the Volt principle.

3

That is the idea that this is just wildly out of bounds.

4

It's the incredibly fact­bound question about whether

5

this one decision is wildly out of bounds.

6

talk about the other reasons it's not remotely wildly

7

out of bounds.

8

anything other than legal rule you just articulated,

9

Justice Alito, we are going to be in an incredible way.

10

Because if you write an opinion about

So let me

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And this is more than

Okay, Justice Kennedy.

17

Because in my ­­ I may be mistaken, but I think that you

rules.

20

and I don't purport to speak for the Justice,

21

25

Kennedy, just to bracket this, why the Volt principle,

Justice Alito is saying, as I understand it ­­

The ambiguities construed in

And the reason, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

41

the Moses H. Cone principle doesn't apply here, and that

2

is that it's ambiguities in the scope of an arbitration

agreement.

4

an arbitration agreement whatsoever.

5

Here the question is whether the parties had

So we ­­ I think we've now agreed on the

6

legal rule perhaps.

7

why I don't think you can write an opinion that says

8

this is nuts.

9

And so let me tell you, if I could,

JUSTICE ALITO:

And add to that, what did

10

the Ninth Circuit say about this?

11

said it was absurd.

The Ninth Circuit

Was that the word?

12

Yeah, it was ­­

20

about nonsensical or not.

21

basically on the same page about the FAA principle.

22

I think you and I are

Here's what I have in terms of why this is

23

not remotely outside the bounds, why, if you write an

24

opinion reversing here, you are going to invite an

25

enormous amount of second­guessing of State law contract

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

interpretation.

2

contract expressly contrasts State and Federal law; that

3

is, it says the law of your State, and then

4

distinguishes Federal law from that.

5

The first is that Section 10 of the

The second is, as Justice Ginsburg says, why

6

is it the parties even referred to State law at all if

7

what they are talking about is just "it would be

8

invalid."

9

The third is both before this contract and

10

after this contract, DIRECTV wrote this contract very

11

differently in the way that it now says this contract

12

means, and it says if it would be found invalid, and as

13

was mentioned in the first half hour, every other

14

Fortune 500 company wrote it that way as well.

15

are a whole series of very good contrasts for us.

16

So there

I also have what I think is the pushback to

17

the intuition that DIRECTV really must have always

18

intended for the contract to pick up Federal preemption

19

law.

20

DIRECTV claims and has applied the power to unilaterally

21

change this contract, and that is a huge deal in the ­­

22

in the context of a national form contract.

23

And here's the reason why that's not right:

Here's what happened here:

DIRECTV put this

24

into the contract in 2006 before AT&T v. Concepcion was

25

a glimmer in anyone's eye at all.

Alderson Reporting Company

And it referred to

Official

43
1

State law, and everybody agrees at that time that

2

California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act was going to

3

control and was going to prevent any arbitration in

4

California whatsoever.

5

Concepcion saying we will not arbitrate with anyone in

6

California before the court's decision in Concepcion.

7

DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in

And the way that DIRECTV intended to account

8

for changes in the law is that they would change the

9

contract unilaterally when the law changed, and I can

10

prove it.

11

the contract.

12

Appeals' decision in this case.

13

In the wake of Concepcion, DIRECTV rewrote
It did it before the California Court of

DIRECTV had another mechanism fully

14

available to it that would account for the idea that

15

now, under the Federal Arbitration Act, the State can't

16

forbid class action waivers.

17

contract to do anything other than to pick up existing

18

California law.

19

It didn't need this

And I will add a couple of other points just

20

about whether, as a matter of Federal law, you would

21

want to say that right now we have to go to arbitration.

22

Remember, DIRECTV's position is in the teeth of the

23

efficiency of the Federal Arbitration Act.

24

that the parties intended that three years into the

25

litigation, what they would want is to blow up the

Alderson Reporting Company

Its view is

Official

44
1

litigation and send everybody to thousands of individual

2

arbitrations.

3

interpretation of what the parties would want if their

4

goal was to have an efficient dispute resolution

5

mechanism.

6

That is an extremely implausible

And so what I'm ­­ the point that I'm trying

7

to make, Your Honors, is while I am sympathetic to the

8

concern, and it may be a concern directed at California

9

in particular, that we need to be attentive to whether

10

or not those courts are discriminating against

11

arbitration.

12

this is wrong, like you were concerned in Oxford Health

13

that the arbitrator had got it wrong, but you have to

14

adopt a legal rule here.

15

in favor of the California Court of Appeals' decision to

16

say that this is wildly out of bounds and have an

17

administrable legal rule that the lower courts can

18

actually apply.

19

could say it's nonsensical.

20

are going to look at what happened here, and they are

21

not going to view it as something that is just wildly

22

impossible.

23

My point to you is that you may believe

And there are too many points

You can say it's way out of bounds; you
But then the lower courts

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess I don't

25

slightly out of bounds.

It's a question of whether it

2

way you show that is you say, well, look, here they

3

4

the whole thing.

5

about arbitration, when they find a couple of provisions

6

illegal, they just sever those; they keep ­­ you know,

7

12

it's a very simple question of ­­ of what the rule is.

13

The rule is does it demonstrate hostility to arbitration

14

contracts?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

It may be a hard
But

Mr. Chief Justice,

16

let me just distinguish this case from the one that you

granted in the Long Conference, which is the factual

18

scenario that you just described.

19

you have is an arbitration agreement.

20

parties have agreed to arbitrate and what you then do is

21

assume that they intend the arbitration to be effective.

22

This is importantly, doctrinally a very different case.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In that context, what
You know that the

That's ­­ I

24

understand the point and ­­ but, as I understand the

25

arbitration law, if you have an arbitration agreement,

says you're going to arbitrate workplace disputes, but

2

not safety disputes ­­

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

4

Yes.
­­ and if there's an

5

issue, is this a safety dispute or not, that's covered

6

by the arbitration agreement.

7

that.

8
9

The arbitrator decides

If you have a contract that says you agree
to arbitrate with all of our subsidiaries except the one

10

that does this, that's not for the arbitrator because

11

you have to decide if that other subsidiary has agreed

12

or not.

13

Now, this one talks about methods of

14

arbitration.

15

either of those two paradigms.

16

It doesn't seem to me to be covered by

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Excellent.

So you've just

court and the arbitrator.

21

The effect of Section 9 is not to determine ­­ this was

up, there is an agreement to arbitrate some disputes

Your Honor, so ­­ if I could

13

of arbitration, that is to say, Section 9 is in the

14

contract.

15

asks is, is there an agreement with ­­ to resolve any

16

disputes by arbitration?

17

in the States where it is effective, where the ­­ what

18

we call the blowup clause takes effect, is that in all

19

of those States, DIRECTV will not arbitrate with

20

individuals, it will not arbitrate with respect to class

21

arbitration.

There is an agreement on the subject

What Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act

22

And what Section 9 tells you

If I could just give you the reasons we know

23

that's true.

24

Concepcion saying we do not arbitrate with anybody in

25

California.

DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in

It then ­­ and you can see this in the

Alderson Reporting Company

compel arbitration said we have gotten 215 small claims

3

requests related to these early termination fees, which

4

is ­­ and in court, which is the subject matter of our

5

complaint.

6

And we have arbitrated with one party.
So what was going on ­­ and so there ­­ in

7

California, DIRECTV was arbitrating with no one

8

whatsoever because of this contractual provision.

9

that brings it not within the Volt principle, Your

And

10

Honor.

your argument ­­ your ­­ your point, Your Honor, about

scope when it comes to safety disputes.

14

within Granite Rock, which said quite expressly, what we

15

are ­­ when we are talking about the antecedent

16

question, we're trying to figure out if you and I have

17

agreed to arbitrate any subjects whatsoever.

18

in that circumstance, we can't presume that we are

19

arbitrating, because the first principle of the Federal

20

Arbitration Act is to not force people to arbitrate when

21

they haven't intended, and to require people to

22

arbitrate when they have.

We interpret ­­ when we have an arbitration

When we're

23

So, Justice Kennedy, the distinction I was

24

drawing with Justice Alito is if we had an arbitration

25

agreement and we were trying to figure out if, say,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

class cases were in and individual cases were out, it

2

would make a little bit more sense to say we're going to

presume and resolve ambiguities in favor of putting

class cases in.

question whether we are going to arbitrate with anyone.

7

I ­­ you and I agree, but the consequence of the place

24

we disagree is important; that is, you and I agree that

this is in the contract.

Okay.

We have a contract on the

And I just don't want ­­ I want to give you one

other issue.

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.
Because it's in my mind,

13

and I'd like you to respond to it, if you wish.

14

I think there's some pretty good arguments that this

15

particular interpretation, consciously or unconsciously,

16

is flying in the face of an opinion of this Court, which

17

I disagreed with.

18

that this particular provision of California law is

19

invalid.

20

Because

That was an opinion that ­­ that said

I dissented.
All right.

So we have, on the one hand, the

21

risks that we'll get into, too many State law cases, if

22

we take their side.

23

risk that they'll run around our decisions.

24

you get to that second thing, even though I dissented, I

25

think it's an extremely important thing in a country

On the other hand, there is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, when

Official

51
1

which has only nine judges here and thousands of judges

2

in other places who must follow our decisions ­­ and

3

think of the desegregation matters, et cetera ­­ that we

4

be pretty firm on saying you can't run around our

5

decisions, even if they're decisions that I disagree

6

with, okay?

7

Now, I raise that because I think it is a

8

factor, and so I would like you to ­­ to say whatever

9

you want.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Breyer, there's one

12

threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five

13

members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand

14

their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in

15

this circumstance.

16

whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who ­­

17

you and the other members of the Court who agreed with

18

it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the

19

parties have agreed by contract.

20

They would not extend it here

And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion

21

in that case that the opinion there ­­ that the ­­ the

22

principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and

23

there is no argument here that this case implicates

24

obstacle preemption because it's a question of contract

25

law.

So at the threshold, I don't think Concepcion

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

would apply here at all.

2

But your question is bigger.

And that is,

3

look, I'm concerned that if we, as the Supreme Court ­­

4

U.S. Supreme Court articulate a question of Federal law,

5

particularly on a statute that's as important as the

6

Federal Arbitration Act, particularly on a statute that

7

is ­­ is rooted in a concern about hostility of the

8

State courts, we have to show people that we're serious.

A couple of things about that.

21

entirely defunct, and the question of whether the

provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far

24

out of bounds.

25

We have filed a

2

we recognize the concern that if you write in an opinion

3

that says, nah, we're not going to take too hard a look,

4

that the State courts will run wild.

5

is that there really isn't evidence of that happening at

all.

7

against arbitration that can handle it.

And

All I can tell you

And the Court has doctrines like discrimination

8
9

One is the concern.

The second is a reality.

We know for a fact

that if you announce an opinion that says, this

interpretation of State law ­­ because we know what the

California law is here.

12

13

too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that's

14

now a question of Federal law, and we are going to

relitigate what State law means.

rule that is going to be invoked in every single

17

arbitration case.

between those two prospects.

And so you just have to choose

determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I'd

4

like to make three very quick points.

5

that opposing counsel, my friend, started with Oxford

6

Health is very telling because Oxford Health was a very

7

different case about the scope of this Court's review of

8

an arbitrator's decision.

9

the parties had delegated the question of the

First, the fact

Everyone there agreed that

10

interpretation of the clause to the arbitrator.

11

that's a very different question.

12

here.

13

what a court did.

You're not reviewing it under the

14

arguable standard.

It's a very different standard.

And

We don't have that

We are ­­ in this case, this Court is reviewing

Second, my friend said that, well, no

16

question that special rules for arbitration would be

preempted is discriminatory.

18

be easy cases.

19

those cases anymore.

20

that there's a new frontier, when a court will just

21

basically reach the same goal by saying black means

22

white.

23

I'm just applying State court principles of

24

interpretation.

25

a rule ­­

And again, those tend to

You're not probably seeing as many of

I haven't done any different rule.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

Why ­­

2

everybody is assuming that this is just a crazy

3

interpretation, but if you start with the proposition

4

that it's the intent of the parties, and everybody's

5

framing this as invalid State law, or valid State law,

6

but your own company decided before Concepcion that it

7

was okay, they would litigate everything, they would

8

take the words as they stood.

MR. LANDAU:
State law was valid.

Because prior to Concepcion,

MR. LANDAU:

Again, Your Honor, you could

decide this case on the ground, as the Chamber of

5

Commerce urged in its amicus brief, that this is so far

6

beyond the pale as an interpretation, that it can only

7

be explained as discrimination.

8

is ­­ you know, it is an existing category for knocking

these out.

It's not the exclusive category.
