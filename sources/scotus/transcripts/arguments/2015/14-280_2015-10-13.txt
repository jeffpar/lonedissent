CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Case 14­280, Montgomery v.

5

Louisiana.

Mr. Bernstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BERNSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE COURT­APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue is whether to decide the question

12

of Miller's retroactivity in this case or in a Federal

13

habeas case such as Johnson v. Manis, No. 15­1 on this

14

Court's docket.

15

In today's case there is no jurisdiction

16

over that question because the point of Section 1257 is

17

to enforce the Supremacy Clause.

18

Clause States that when, quote, "the laws of the

19

United States," unquote, apply, quote, "the judges" ­­

20

and this is ­­ these are the key words ­­ "in every

21

State shall be bound thereby."

22

And the Supremacy

There is no such thing as supreme Federal

23

law that depends on whether a particular State

24

voluntarily makes Federal precedence binding.

25

State does that, when a State voluntarily adopts

Alderson Reporting Company

When a

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

nonbinding Federal precedence, that creates no right

2

under Federal law, which is what 1257 requires, and

3

Michigan v. Long does not apply.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So how would you describe

5

the adequate and independent State ground on which

6

the ­­ this decision rested?

7

MR. BERNSTEIN:

I would say that the lack of

8

a binding Federal law question is an antecedent

9

requirement, to borrow the terminology of the S.G.'s

10

brief, before you get to the adequate and independent

11

State ground analysis.

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't we have

jurisdiction to answer that question?

14

MR. BERNSTEIN:

You certainly have

15

jurisdiction to answer the question whether Teague is

16

constitutionally required in State collateral review

17

courts.

18

The second part of our brief said why it is

19

not constitutionally required in State collateral review

20

courts, and that's basically this Court's precedence

21

from Danforth back to the beginning in Desist and in

22

Kaufman, have said that the Teague ­­ what have become

23

the Teague exceptions are matters of equitable

24

discretion and not matters of the Constitution, and the

25

Federal habeas statute on its face only applies in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

Federal court.

2
3

So the Federal habeas court can grant relief
if relief is warranted under the Teague exception.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If a State says, we

5

acknowledge that we are holding a prisoner in

6

contravention of Federal law but we choose to do nothing

7

about it, then the answer is Federal habeas corpus;

8

there is not a second answer that the State can be

9

required under the Supremacy Clause, under its own

10

procedures, to enforce the Federal law?

11

And if ­­ if I'm ­­ and if I were to take ­­

12

to argue that second position, I'm not quite sure what

13

case I would have to support me.

14
15

MR. BERNSTEIN:

It wouldn't ­­

Well, I think that Your

Honor's opinion for the Court in Martinez v. Ryan ­­

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Yes.
­­ 132 Supreme Court at 1319

18

to 1320 suggested that there are advantages to citing

19

the Federal habeas right in the Federal habeas statute

20

rather than what the Court called a freestanding

21

constitutional claim.

22

say that the State courts are bound by the Teague

23

exceptions by the Constitution, then when it goes to

24

Federal habeas, there will be very deferential AEDPA

25

review.

A major advantage here is if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

If you say that the redress question, as the

2

rationale of Danforth indicated, in State court is a

3

matter of State law, then when the issue goes to Federal

4

habeas, AEDPA will not apply because the State court

5

will not have decided the Federal issue.

6

­­ it is a major difference.

7

weakening the Federal habeas statute to recognize

8

jurisdiction in this case.

9

And that is a

You would actually be

And this Court will benefit from having de

10

novo percolation in the lower Federal courts, the lower

11

habeas courts, all of which will be out the window if

12

there's jurisdiction in this case, because the lower

13

Federal habeas courts will only be able, and the courts

14

reviewing them on appeal, to apply the highly

15

deferential AEDPA review.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In effect, are you ­­ we

17

saying that the Supremacy Clause binds the States only

18

in direct criminal proceedings?

19

MR. BERNSTEIN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21
22

No.
I mean, is that another

way of phrasing your argument?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

It would be that the

23

Supremacy Clause only binds the States in direct

24

proceedings and in collateral proceedings where it's an

25

old rule, because that's the equivalent of a direct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7

proceeding.

2

retroactivity of a new rule, then the ­­ that's where

3

the Teague ­­ the two Teague exceptions apply.

4

apply to new rules.

5

And those are based in statutory equitable discretion

6

rather than the Constitution.

7

held that both direct review and the application of old

8

rules present Federal questions.

11

But if you are talking about the

They

They apply to collateral review.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the Court has already

How do you differentiate

this case from Standard Oil?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Because in Standard Oil, the

12

issue was the underlying status of the Federal

13

government arm, and the Court said that question is

14

controlled by Federal law.

15

itself, where the issue was:

16

Amendment require?

17

issue it applied.

18

Standard Oil is like Miller
What does the Eighth

That's a Federal constitutional

In Standard Oil, as a combination of statute

19

regulations and Federal common law, Federal law

20

controlled the question.

21

in State court, as Danforth and numerous other cases

22

have held, like the Federal Rules of Evidence don't

23

apply in State court, even though many courts follow

24

similar provisions and certainly follow Federal

25

precedence in interpreting those similar rules.

Here the statute doesn't apply

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we did say that that

State could define the exemption any which way it

wanted.

Correct.
And so it could ­­ it's

almost identical here; we would announce what the

said it's going to follow Teague, but I guess it might

that.

11

MR. BERNSTEIN:

I think the difference and

12

what makes this case special is that this Court has held

13

since Murdock v. City of Memphis, almost 150 years ago,

14

87 U.S. at 326 to 327, that the 1267 jurisdiction is

15

16

case.

17

It is not like 1331, case by

It is question by question.
And I do not believe the Court has

18

jurisdiction to skip over the question of whether

19

Federal law applies and then answer the hypothetical if

20

Federal law applied, what would it be.

21

question of whether Federal law applies is a

22

jurisdiction question.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think the

How ­­ how ­­ suppose ­­

there are a thousand people in prison.

3

4

All right.

5

retroactive to people in prison?

6

it isn't like some kind of statutory discretion.

7

Rather, there are human beings who are in prison, who

8

are there without having violated any valid law, because

9

it was always protected by the First Amendment.

10

This Court in a

What is the law that would make that
It sounds to me that

And if that's right, then it's the

11

Constitution, the Due Process Clause, that says they are

12

being held ­­ even though they committed the crime 22

13

years ago, they are now being held in confinement

14

without due process of law because you cannot

15

criminalize their behavior.

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Yes.
That being so, it's a

22

whether they satisfy the two exceptions.

23

MR. BERNSTEIN:

The only question is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. PLAISANCE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PLAISANCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Miller v. Alabama established a new

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

substantive rule prohibiting mandatory life without

2

parole for juveniles, which should be applied

3

retroactively.

4

This Court has jurisdiction to hear Henry

5

Montgomery's claim because the Louisiana Supreme Court

6

relied exclusively on Federal jurisprudence.

7

In Miller, this Court held that mandatory

8

life in prison was unconstitutional.

9

life in prison would be an uncommon, rare sentence, even

10
11

It also held that

today.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't it just like a

12

State saying:

13

Federal Constitution has a Fourth Amendment; we are

14

going to apply our own Constitution, but in applying it,

15

we will follow the Federal precedent?

16

We have a Fourth Amendment, and the

I think we would say, in that case, the case

17

has been decided on the State constitutional ground,

18

even though the State court, in interpreting that

19

ground, is looking to Federal decisions.

20

MR. PLAISANCE:

In this case, Your Honor,

21

the Louisiana Supreme Court did not state that it was

22

exercising any independent grounds at all.

23

case it cited said that.

MR. PLAISANCE:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well ­­
I thought it cited an

3

earlier Louisiana Supreme Court case which made it very

4

clear that it was following the Federal rule as a matter

5

of discretion and not because ­­ not because it had to,

6

and it could in a later opinion decide not to follow

7

Federal law.

In fact, they said in that opinion, we are

And that's what was

Did they not say in Taylor

16

that they were not bound to follow Teague?

say, we're going to follow Teague but we ­­ we want to

Didn't they

19

MR. PLAISANCE:

They did say that.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

They've never ­­ they've

21
22

never retracted that, have they?
MR. PLAISANCE:

Correct, but the choice

23

itself is not necessarily a matter of State law.

24

the Supreme Court had the authority to make that

25

decision, it said, we believe ­­ by choosing Teague, we

Alderson Reporting Company

While

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

believe that is the better law, and therefore, we will

2

follow the Federal guidelines from Teague, the Federal

3

jurisprudence, in doing so.

4

And I believe that under Michigan v. Long,

5

unless they state a clear and independent ground, this

6

Court can conclusively presume that they applied Federal

7

law as they believed this Court would apply ­­

20

We're applying State law rather than

here.

we don't have to follow Teague, but we choose to as a

matter of State law.

24
25

They said that.

This is a matter of State law;

I thought that's what they said.

MR. PLAISANCE:

And I believe that that's

sufficient to indicate to this Court that it is applying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17

Federal law; it is not applying State law.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Plaisance, I think

what people are saying to you is that this is different

from your standard Michigan v. law question ­­ Long

question.

6

says, we're not bound to follow Teague, we know we can

do something different, but we want to follow Teague.

It's a different question.

It's a State that

Now, that's not a Michigan v. Long question.

17

It's more like a Merrell Dow question or something like

18

that, where Federal law is ­­ the State has chosen it,

19

but it's just part and parcel of the claim, because the

20

State is so committed to following Federal law in all

21

its particulars.

22

MR. PLAISANCE:

I agree with Your Honor.

23

And even in Danforth, this Court said that the question

24

of retroactivity is a pure question of Federal law.

law.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Federal statutory

law, right?

14

that the reason the States can go beyond what the

15

Federal interpretation is is because we're talking about

16

the Federal habeas statute.

17

I thought that was the point of Danforth,

MR. PLAISANCE:

Right?
That's correct, Your Honor,

but even in Yates, this Court said that on State habeas,

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

This Court does have jurisdiction to decide

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, but when you say that

that's a doubtful case, I think you are implicitly

we're going to have to parse the words that were ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. DREEBEN:

So there are several reasons,

Justice Alito.

3

First of all, I don't think that it is

that ­­ going to come up in that way to this Court,

5

because that's not the way States treat their own rules

of procedure.

7

I don't think it will be very difficult.

There is a principle in the Court's cases

8

that when Federal law has been adopted as Federal law,

9

the Court will review it even if the State could have

10

chosen a different path.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

The State has adopted Teague

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

The ­­ the rule in Miller v. Alabama, in our

16

view, is a substantive rule, because it goes far beyond

17

merely regulating the procedure by which youths are

18

sentenced for homicide crimes.

19

to adopt new substantive sentencing options, an option

20

that is less severe than life without parole.

21

It compelled the State

The only other time that this Court has ever

22

invalidated a mandatory sentencing provision was

23

Woodson v. North Carolina in 1976.

24

like 36 years before we had another decision that

25

concluded that the law must change to accommodate the

So we went something

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32

compelling interests in having the characteristics of

2

youth that mitigate culpability considered in the

sentencing process.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would it be

5

enough ­­ is ­­ is it enough if the States simply say,

6

okay, with respect to people who have been mandatorily

Yes.

I believe that it would

case that held that youths who do not commit homicide

That would be the same remedy that the Court

And the Court's remedy for that problem

16

could either be a sentence of term of years, but it

could also be simply converting the life­without­parole

19

So that would be ­­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, how do you

21

explain how your articulation of your test wouldn't

22

apply to the guideline changes in Booker that we made?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

So I ­­ I think, Justice

24

Sotomayor, the key difference is that, with respect to

25

the guidelines, there was always a ­­ a minimum and a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

33
1

maximum set by statute.

2

they were mandatory, did not preclude judges from

3

sentencing outside the guidelines, depending upon the

4

presence of aggravating or mitigating factors that

5

weren't taken into account.

6

And the guidelines, even when

And as Justice Alito's opinion for the Court

7

in United States v. Rodriguez recognized, even the top

8

of a mandatory guidelines range was not truly mandatory.

9

So even under the mandatory guidelines, which for Sixth

10

Amendment purposes were treated as if they established

11

elements of the offense, for the purposes that we're

12

looking at here, they are not mandatory in the same way,

13

so that Booker brought about a procedural change.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is the substantive

15

difference ­­ if you pardon the use of that word ­­

16

between your formulation and Petitioner's formulation?

17

He says this is substantive because it did

18

away with mandatory life imprisonment.

19

articulating it slightly different.

20

see as the difference and why your articulation is ­­

21

MR. DREEBEN:

You're

Tell me what you

Justice Sotomayor, I don't

22

think there is any substantive, to use the word,

23

daylight between Petitioner's position and ours.

24

description of the crime at issue as punishable by

25

mandatory life imprisonment and treating that as a

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

34
1

category, I think, sums up the reality of what is

2

happening.

3

We broke it out into its component parts

4

because I think it facilitates the analysis of it to

5

understand that Miller does have a procedural component.

6

Sentencing courts must now consider the mitigating

7

characteristics of age, but it also, and more

8

fundamentally in our view, contains a substantive

9

component that required a change in the law.

10

Now, the change here was expanding the range

11

of outcomes.

12

substantive changes in the law, there have been changes

13

that restricted the form of outcome; say, for example,

14

in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, forbidding punishment

15

at all.

16

Previously when this Court has analyzed

But I think that if you trace back the

17

origins of the substantive category to Justice Harlan's

18

opinion in Mackey, this is still faithful to what

19

Justice Harlan had in mind.

20

clearest case of an injustice in not applying a rule

21

retroactively is when it puts off­limits altogether

22

criminal punishment.

23

only case.

Justice Harlan said the

He did not say that it was the

24

And I think that if you consider what is

25

going on in Miller and the reasons for the rule, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

35
1

Court made very clear that it believed that of the 2,000

2

people that were in prison and under mandatory life for

3

juvenile homicide, the Court believed that that penalty

4

was frequently disproportionate, that it would be

5

uncommonly imposed in the future, and that it was not a

6

sentence that was consistent in most cases with the

7

mitigating characteristics of youth that have been

8

recognized in Roper and in Graham and then in Miller.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would it be accurate to say

10

that a rule is substantive if it makes a particular

11

outcome less likely or much less likely or much, much

12

less likely than was previously the case?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Probably the last, Justice

When ­­ when the Court characterized substantive

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's the difference

between much less likely and much, much less likely?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I would put it in the

19

words that the Court has used previously.

20

said that a substantive rule creates a significant risk

21

that the person is serving a sentence that's not

22

appropriate for that person, maybe not even legally

23

available for that purpose.

24

conclusively proves it.

25

The Court has

It did not say absolutely

It said significant risk.

And in contrast, when the Court has talked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

36
1

about procedural rules, rules that govern the manner in

2

which a case is adjudicated, it has said that the

3

likelihood or potential for a different outcome is

4

speculative.

5

And I think if you put this case on the

6

speculative­significant risk axis, this case falls in

7

the significant risk domain precisely because of the

8

reasons why the Court said it was deciding Miller.

9

The reasons why the Court decided Miller had

10

to do with the reduced culpability of youth and the

11

capacity of youth to mature, change, and achieve a

12

degree of rehabilitation that is consistent with

13

something less than the most harsh sentence available

14

for youths who commit murder ­­ a terrible crime, but

15

still the harshest sentence, the Court thought, would be

reserved for the worst of the worst, which is, in fact,

offenders who commit the worst crimes.

And so when you combine the fact that this

22

is not a rule that ­­ that only governs procedure ­­ it

23

doesn't just govern evidence; it also mandates changes

in outcomes as an available option ­­ with the very

25

genesis of the Miller rule in a conclusion that, for the

people in this class, the appropriateness of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. S. KYLE DUNCAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22

MR. DUNCAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I was going to begin by saying I would

23

proceed directly to the merits, but I gather from the

24

drift of the argument that the Court has serious

25

questions about jurisdiction, and so I'd like to briefly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

39
1

begin there.

2

We're in an odd position with respect to

jurisdiction because we won below and we'd win in the

4

Fifth Circuit on Federal habeas, which has found that

5

Miller is not retroactive.

jurisdiction?

7

Why then do we not contest

We believe and still believe that this is a

8

straightforward case.

9

not a standard Michigan v. Long case, but it's an

Not ­­ and Justice Kagan, it's

10

interwoven case, meaning that the ­­ the State court

11

took Teague lock, stock, and barrel.

12

Now, there is no doubt, Justice Scalia, that

in the ­­ in the Taylor ­­ in the previous Louisiana

14

Supreme Court opinions, that the State said we are

voluntarily adopting Teague.

And why do we say it doesn't?

There is no doubt about

So we think the question is whether that raises

Well, because in cases like Coleman v.

20

Thompson and Eddings v. Oklahoma, the Court said where

21

the Federal law holding is integral to the State court's

disposition of the matter, there is no risk of an

advisory opinion.

24

only if resolution of the Federal issue in court could

not affect the judgment is it at risk of an advisory

JUSTICE ALITO:

the State made its tax­exemption law turn on Federal law

MR. DUNCAN:

I think that's possible, but

this Court didn't make its jurisdiction dependent on

Now, it's only

It's the same

Well, I don't think so, because

JUSTICE ALITO:

a distinction between that case and this case?

9

MR. DUNCAN:

Well, if ­­ if ­­ if the

10

Teague ­­ if the Teague standard is a discrete Federal

In Miller, this ­­ on to the merits:

In

2

Miller, this Court was invited to categorically bar the

3

penalty of life without parole for juveniles who commit

4

murder, but it decided not to do so.

5

Now, that decision leads directly to the

6

conclusion, in our view, that Miller is not a

7

substantive rule under Teague's first exception.

8

Consideration of the Teague framework, Teague policies,

9

and Teague precedent points instead to the conclusion

10

that Miller is a procedural and not a substantive rule.

11

So we think Summerlin most helpfully sets

12

out the framework that ought to govern this question.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

lot of theft, and so strikes the mandatory minimum.

24

Says, you just can't have a mandatory minimum like that;

25

make it lower.

That's incredibly disproportionate to a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

51

Would that be a substantive ruling?

2

MR. DUNCAN:

We don't think so, Justice

manner of imposing a penalty.

MR. DUNCAN:

Well, so in ­­ in ­­ if in that

16

hypothetical that doesn't go to the manner of imposing

the penalty, then it's different than Miller, because

18

Miller made very clear that the mandatory aspect of the

19

penalty goes to the manner of imposing the penalty ­­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

MR. DUNCAN:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think ­­

­­ not something substantive.
So if you're saying, no,

23

that's different because there was something else in

24

Miller ­­ there is something else in Miller.

25

bunch.

There is a

There ­­ there is ­­ there is a process

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

component of Miller, no question about it, where the

2

Court says what courts are supposed to look at is ­­ are

3

the characteristics of youth and are supposed to try to

4

figure out whether these terrible crimes are functions,

5

in part, of immaturity or ­­ or ­­ or not, whether

6

you ­­ you really are looking at an incorrigible

7

defendant.

8
9

So there is that process component.

But

that process component does not take away the fact that

10

there is a completely separate, self­sufficient

11

component as to what the range of punishment has to be.

12

That's completely on all fours with the hypothetical

13

that I gave you.

14

MR. DUNCAN:

Well, your ­­ Justice Kagan,

15

the ­­ the relevant difference in terms of the Teague

16

analysis is that this Court in Miller did not take the

17

punishment of life without parole, the distinct category

18

of punishment of life without parole, off the table.

19

This Court has never held that a noncategorical rule is

20

substantive under Teague.

21

And it's done that for good reasons:

22

Because that would fly in the face of the policies that

23

inform the Teague analysis.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, you're exactly right.

It did not take the LWOP punishment off the table.

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

53

similarly, in my hypothetical, a 20­year sentence for

2

theft has not been taken off the table.

3

What the Court has done is to say, there

4

have to be other options.

5

ten years or five years or two years, whatever it is.

6

There has to be an option of

MR. DUNCAN:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12
13

I ­­
And so they've made the

sentence different.
MR. DUNCAN:

I understand that.

But making

14

the sentence different doesn't necessarily mean make it

15

substantive under the Teague framework.

16

Here's another way of looking at it.

The

17

defendant in a ­­ a juvenile murderer who committed ­­

18

who committed murder and is serving a

19

life­without­parole sentence today, pre­Miller, is not

20

facing a punishment that the law cannot impose on him.

21

And we know that from Miller because Miller said the

22

Court's decision does not preclude that punishment.

23

And so that goes to finality.

has been stated, the first ­­ the first prong of it is

22

it has to alter our understanding of bedrock procedural

24

would be a strange case to find that in, because Miller

itself doesn't represent a bedrock revolution in

It's not a

So ­­ and ­­ and I think this Court

8

explained in Whorton v. Bockting that it's not enough

9

that the rule be fundamental in some ­­ in some abstract

sense ­­ right? ­­ but it has to itself represent a

11

change in bedrock procedural understandings.

12

don't think Miller does that.

13

And we

We also don't think it's necessary to an

accurate determination of a sentence.

the accuracy of the sentence, but it's not necessary.

It would enhance

And the other point there is this Court has

never hold that a ­­ held that a pure sentencing rule

18

can qualify under watershed, because, after all, this

19

Court has on many occasions said that a watershed rule

20

is necessary to the accurate determination of guilt or

21

innocence, and here we're talking about a sentence.

22

So we ­­ we agree with the United States

23

that watershed procedural analysis is not the way to go

24

here, but it does raise an interesting question.

In Summerlin ­­ because, after all, we do ­­

point about the framework.

opportunity of getting a more lenient outcome under the

look at both the maximum and the minimum.

And when you decide whether a

we would see two categories of punishment on the table.

we read through Miller.

Now,

It's pretty hard to say ­­ I

Alderson Reporting Company

65

mean, my goodness, Miller is just filled with paragraph

2

after paragraph about how a mandatory requirement for

3

life without parole fails to take account of all the

4

characteristics or many characteristics adherent in

5

youth.

6

And it's pretty hard to come away from that

7

without thinking, gee, accuracy under a mandatory life

8

without parole does seriously diminish the accuracy of

9

imposing life without parole when you apply the

MR. DUNCAN:

But in ­­ every Eighth

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

But you have to

say the accuracy is seriously diminished.

MR. DUNCAN:

And she says,

Well, again, take a ­­ we

18

haven't talked about the capital sentencing cases, but

19

take a case like O'Dell, where the capital jury was not

20

informed of the defendant's parole and eligibility while

21

considering his future dangerousness.

22

easily say that the accuracy of the resulting death

23

sentence under the old rule was seriously diminished,

24

and yet this Court said in O'Dell that that is not a

Thank you, counsel.

MR. PLAISANCE:

Your Honors, I'd like to

Resolving

this case under Teague avoids the serious constitutional

19

question of whether due process requires retroactivity

Mr. Bernstein, the Court appointed you as an
