ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

This entire case turns on four words of the

13

statute:

14

"fraudulent" have been unchanged since 1863 in this

15

statute.

"False or fraudulent claim."

"False" and

"Claim" is defined by statute.

16

I'll come back to those words.

17

Three separate State agencies investigated

18

the facts of this case in detail.

19

produced lengthy reports and proposed remedial measures

20

for certain alleged regulatory violations.

21

asked for any money back.

22

imposed on the company.

23

and the claimant director was given two years of

24

supervision.

25

All three agencies

No sanction at all was
One individual was fined $1,000

Through the magic of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

implied­certification theory under the False Claims Act,

2

the very same facts have now been recharacterized as

3

fraud on the government.

4

The First Circuit focused on a single

5

alleged regulatory violation involving a regulation not

6

cited in the complaint, not cited in any appellate

7

brief, not cited in the amicus brief of the Commonwealth

8

of Massachusetts.

9
10

That is not what "fraud" means.

Now, coming back to the four words that
matter, "false or fraudulent claim."

11

"False" means false.

This Court construed

12

that word in Williams v. United States.

13

Respondents' brief unsuccessfully tries to distinguish

14

Williams.

15
16

The Solicitor General ignores Williams.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It can't mean misleading,

then?

17
18

Footnote 3 of

So "false" can only mean false?

It can't

mean deceptive, misleading?

21

misleading statements is not falsity.

And the law of fraud is stated in Section 551 of

The written part does not actually use the

Could

7

not a jury or the judge find that that implicit term of

8

the contract that the services would be provided by a

9

doctor was breached, it was a material breach, and,

10

therefore, the implicit statement was false?

11
12

MR. ENGLERT:

Two responses, if I may,

Justice Breyer.

13

First, the whole problem here is the

tortification of contract.

15

case, but it's not automatically a good tort case.

Yes, that's a good contract

16

The second answer ­­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. ENGLERT:

No, no.

What's the second?

Section 551(2)(e) of the

19

Restatement deals with that exact situation, facts basic

20

to the transaction.

21

meaning of fraud that will accommodate the cases in

22

which liability makes sense because every reasonable

23

person, as Your Honor said, would assume something to be

24

true.

25

So the common law has developed a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, fine.

But now let's

6

go a step further.

7

such that any reasonable person would assume there is an

8

implicit statement that the services will be provided by

9

a doctor.

10

We have our contract.

The facts are

You say that could be a breach of contract.
Now it turns out that this company that has

11

that contract has sold the shares over the SEC.

12

SEC says, you know, it's so obvious that that implicit

13

statement in the contract meant that they had a doctor

14

who was a doctor ­­ that's so obvious ­­ that we think

15

in selling shares in this company, where indeed this

16

contract was absolutely critical, millions of dollars

17

was at stake, without a doctor, violating of implicit

18

statement that there was a doctor, we think that's fraud

19

under Rule 10(b)(5).

20
21

MR. ENGLERT:

And the

I'm glad Your Honor brought

that up.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. ENGLERT:

All right.

The SEC has a habit of

24

construing fraud under 10(b)(5), and this Court has a

25

habit of reining the SEC in.

5

I mean, let me take Justice Breyer's

Let's say that there's a contract and there

is an explicit term, and it says I commit to providing a

7

doctor's care.

8

medical care that was provided was not by a doctor.

9

was by a nurse or it was by somebody with not even that

Yes?

And then it turns out that the

enters into the contract makes a statement, demands

12

payment, and says the care was provided.

13

It

And ­­ and then the person who

Now, some care was provided; it is true.

14

But medical care, a doctor's care was not provided.

15

Now, by withholding that fact and by just saying the

16

care was provided, have I not committed fraud under the

17

common law?

18

MR. ENGLERT:

No, Your Honor.

Justice

19

Kagan, that is not fraud.

20

actually dealt with by Restatement Section 551(2)(b) and

21

by the famous Junius decision written by Justice Cardozo

22

for the New York Court of Appeals.

that Justice Kagan just gave.

That's exactly the Justice's

MR. ENGLERT:

Justice Kennedy, if I

14

understood Justice Kagan's hypothetical question

15

correctly, it is not fraud within the meaning of

16

551(2)(b).

17

okay?

18

very far cry from the facts in this case in which the

19

court of appeals had to invoke a regulation that cross

20

referenced another regulation that nobody had cited and

21

said the failure to announce a violation of that

22

violation when submitting a claim is fraud.

But let's suppose that I'm wrong about that,

ago ­­

may be wrong on the timing, but it's been amended to

redefine materiality as a very, very low standard.

14

the point is not use it or don't use it.

15

that before you get to materiality, you have to have a

So yes, I agree with you that to think about

8

fraud, one must have the kind of statement that is

fraudulent and materiality and scienter.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what I understood you to

be saying, Mr. Englert, was that all of these common

examples, examples that really led to the False Claims

2

And the entire idea behind this statute is

that in that demand of payment is a representation.

representation is that I've given you guns that shoot

and boots that wear and food that can be eaten.

MR. ENGLERT:

Two things, Justice Kagan, in

response.

13

not denying that any of those can be fraudulent claims.

14

And again, Section 551(2)(b) and (e) of the Restatement

15

cover those.

16
17

One, those all may be fraudulent claims.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm

Well, if those are

fraudulent claims ­­

18

MR. ENGLERT:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I may ­­
­­ I ­­ I would think that

20

this is the exact same, is that the contract was for a

doctor's medical care, and a doctor's medical care was

not provided.

MR. ENGLERT:

disagreement with that analysis?

the case in the district court, we might have cited that

12

provision.

13

And had I been fortunate enough to litigate

But I would point out that the key point

14

here ­­ and I don't think the other side disputes this,

15

is that when you're providing mental healthcare to

16

teenagers and other children, it should be supervised,

17

and it should be given by people who have the proper

18

license.

19

I don't think that it takes any great leap

20

of essentiality or materiality or intrinsicness or

21

whatever words the Petitioner wants to come up with,

22

that's pretty basic.

23

And the violation that occurred here was one

that is all over the mass health regulations.

25

look at it in the supervisor, the clinical director's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is your ­­ is

7

your position that every material breach of a contract

8

gives rise to a False Claims Act ­­ a claim under the

9

False Claims Act as false and fraudulent?

10

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Our position is that

11

there are two other requirements in the Act.

12

that they be done knowingly.

13

definition of "knowing" has three features, with

14

knowledge, deliberate indifference or reckless

15

disregard.

16

One is

And under the statute, the

So there is a knowledge requirement that has

17

to be done, and I would point out, Justice Breyer, that

18

actually solves virtually every problem in the

19

Petitioner's amici because they are talking about

20

situations in which they are not focusing on the

21

knowledge requirement of the fraudster who is seeking to

22

get government funds.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so if ­­ I

24

know you've got another one, and I want to keep that in

25

mind, but if it's a situation where the alleged material

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

breach is of Massachusetts Regulation 185(Z)(3), (4),

2

(8), (10), or whatever, you ­­ the claimant would have

to show knowledge of that regulation?

MR. FREDERICK:

that ­­

10

MR. FREDERICK:

That causes concern,

12

of course, because there are thousands of pages of

standard, about the particular regulation that the

government could reject payment on this basis.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It was

But it has to know

22

not only about the particular provision but that it was

23

material and the government wouldn't pay without it.

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

And that's

why, Justice Kennedy, to go back to your question, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27
1

key Restatement provision here is not 551, it's 529,

2

which we've cited in our brief at page 29, and which

3

essentially is not discussed in the opening presentation

4

by my friend.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But here, looking ­­

6

looking at what you just said, you said the three

7

conditions are where it's not written on the form, and

8

the ­­ the submitter has to know about it, second, he ­­

9

it has to have been material.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Correct.
And, third, he has to omit

telling the government about it.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.
Okay.

Now, I look at the

15

two things he talked about in the Restatement, and he

16

says matters known to him that he knows to be necessary

17

to prevent his partial or ambiguous statement from being

18

misleading ­­ boy, that's pretty close to what you

21

What's the difference between ­­ I mean, I

know the people are experts, and this will tell me there

23

are huge differences.

24

what you just said and what he said?

25

But what's the difference between

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I think that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

28
1

difference is that I think there's an easier Restatement

2

provision that is more directly on point.

3

could just quote from our brief at page 28 to 29.

4

quote the Restatement, Section 529:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's got to

11

be ­­ he has to know about the specific provision in the

12

regulation.

13
14

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

That's

correct.

15

But here, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that it

16

would be odd to suppose that in what are 28 provisions

17

of the Mass Health regulations in what is a massive

18

program involving, you know, billions of dollars, where

19

their business model is predicated on serving indigent

20

people so that they can get access to

21

Medicaid­reimbursed funds, that they would read the

22

regulations.

23

provide supervision when you're providing mental health

24

care.

25

And a number of them say it is critical to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Okay.

So you think

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

29
1

it's an easy case to prove, in other words, because they

2

would have necessarily known that.

3

to know is of that regulation, whatever one of the 28 it

4

is, and they have to know that the government will

5

regard that as material.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

But what they have

That's correct.

But ­­ but

7

the key point here, Mr. Chief Justice, is I don't think

8

that that should be a difficult case.

9

Now, the other side spends a lot of time

10

talking about worthless services, and they seek in their

11

brief at pages 37 and 38 to say that the standard is

12

only when these goods are so worthless or the services

13

are so worthless, that it would be rather obvious.

14

I would point out that if the worthless services are

15

recoverable under the False Claims Act, then it is okay

16

to have an implied certification theory.

17

essentially conceded that if the goods are completely

18

worthless, it would be okay for the government to bring

19

a False Claims Act case.

20

And

They have

Now, I would submit that if the goods are

21

partially worthless, if ­­ those have also to be

22

recoverable because there's no clear way to draw a line

23

between those that are partially worthless and those

24

that are completely worthless.

25

Let me give you a simple example.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

30
1

Here, under what I understand Petitioner's

2

theory to be, if Petitioner had gotten some college

3

interns who were studying psychology, and it decided to

4

allow those interns to practice in their medical

5

facilities, and those college interns gave what was

6

called therapy to teenagers, under their theory, they

7

don't have to tell the government that these are college

8

interns who don't have college degrees, or

9

certifications, or licenses required by the State, and

10

it is A­OK to charge the government full freight.

11

only for the service, but under .408, they're also

12

charging with the representation that they have embedded

13

in a supervision cost.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suspect most cases

15

are a little more complicated than that, and that's

where the difficulty comes in when you have hundreds,

2

in, in that it's a little more complicated than that.

3

And I just don't know if I can take your abstract

4

hypothetical and transfer it to the reality of

5

government contract.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, let me ­­ let me go

7

with the core of what I think the concern is in your

8

statement, and in the position by the amici on the other

9

side, and it's that we don't have enough notice.

We

10

don't know what's really important to the government.

11

That's their basic problem.

12

Right?

Now, they don't solve that problem under

13

either of the two theories that they present in their

case.

15

solve that by having the check­off box ­­ I think,

16

Justice Breyer, you were the one who mentioned this ­­

17

MR. FREDERICK:

They're going to look

situations, by and large, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

in the healthcare area under entitlement programs in

These are

10

which the government is setting the rate and in which

11

the person is saying, I'm providing service in

12

compliance with the Federal statutes and the

13

regulations, and, therefore, I have a legal entitlement

14

to receive reimbursement.

15

So in that scenario, the problem is that

16

what they really want is for the government to pick and

17

choose among the things that are most important, and

18

once you do that, you're creating a roadmap for fraud.

19

Because all you're doing ­­ every time you omit

20

something that might be material in any particular

21

circumstance, but it's not specified in the list of the

22

absolutely most critical things, you're just inviting

provisions that have certification requirements.

not going to solve most of ­­

No, I agree with you.

There are Federal dollars that are going to

third parties in which people are engaging in contracts

11

13

even your kind of basic certification isn't going to

14

work.

15

And in those kinds of situations,

So the problem here, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

fundamentally, is one where the two elements of

17

materiality and knowledge are going to solve the vast

18

bulk of the problems.

19

negligently or at a lower standard, simply just missed

under the False Claims Act either.
And notably, the other side has a lot of

amicus briefs, but they don't really point to any

specific cases.

what they ­­ what's happened to them.

And his conclusion is that not only has

10

there been no spike as a result of the implied

certification theory having been adopted, but that, in

12

fact, the problems that are identified don't actually

13

come to pass because the vast bulk of the cases that are

14

not intervened in by the government, in fact, are done

15

at a motion to dismiss.

16

And so I would submit to you that if you

looked at the actual data for the False Claims Act, a

follows up on Justice Kagan's hypothetical about the

representation nonmisleading.

You have made a

And what we have here, at least if the facts

are as alleged, is basically the same thing.

complaint recites that in requesting payment, Universal

used billing codes, five­digit numbers that were

Now obviously, the claims would have been

6

false if no services had been provided at all.

7

assume everyone would agree that if MassHealth ­­ I'm

sorry ­­ if Universal Health Services had billed for

services provided in a group setting but had used the

10

code that MassHealth had identified for individual

therapy, that would have been a false claim because

12

MassHealth is entitled to treat the use of that code as

13

a representation that the services were ­­ were

14

performed individually.

15

And, really, it's no ­­ it's not a large

leap to say when you use the code for individual

therapy, you are representing by ­­ that the services

were performed, the treatment was performed by a person

who was legally authorized to provide mental health

Now, unlike the contract hypothetical that

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think if we got a bill

20

for particular services and the services had been

21

essentially performed as they were expected to be, the

22

government's policy objectives were adequately advanced

23

but some technical requirement had not been complied

24

with, that if it's a nonmaterial term, then by

25

definition, it wouldn't excuse the government's duty to

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So the

contract is to provide all these health services, and by

the way, you've got to buy, you know, staplers made in

6

everything, but they don't buy staplers made in the

And they do

I would say the government, if they're, you
know, rigorous contracting officers, would say okay, you

10

get, you know, 99,000 whatever, but we're going to

11

penalize you because you didn't use staplers ­­ we put

12

that in there for a reason, you didn't do it, so we're

13

going to withhold $100, right?

14

MR. STEWART:

We would certainly agree that

15

in government contracting it's sometimes the case that

16

the government's trying to serve ancillary policy

17

objectives such as buy America, et cetera.

18

And so if under the terms of the agreement

19

and the ­­ the law of contracts, the government would be

What would count as not material?

MR. STEWART:

there were, presumably they wouldn't be in the ­­ the

rule that said at all times, a hospital that is
