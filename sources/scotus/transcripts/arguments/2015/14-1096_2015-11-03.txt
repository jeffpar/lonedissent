ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW L. GUADAGNO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. GUADAGNO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Congress made a choice.

Congress did not

11

choose to make generic arson an aggravated felony.

12

Instead, Congress chose to make Federal arson an

13

aggravated felony.

14

And that makes sense.

15

statute has a minimum sentence of five years.

16

at least 18 States with arson offenses that are

17

classified as misdemeanors.

18

misdemeanor arson offenses involving damage to property

19

worth less than a hundred dollars.

20

The Federal arson
There are

Arizona and Colorado have

Congress would not have wanted to make such

21

minor offenses aggravated felonies.

22

because of the statutory scheme.

23

We know this

Within the aggravated felony statute, we

24

have generic offenses, very serious ones like murder and

25

rape.

There are no ­­ there are no sentence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4

2

requirements for those very serious generic offenses.
However, for the remaining generic offenses

3

that are ­­ that are listed in ­­ in ­­ in the

4

aggravated felony statute, they ­­ they are associated

5

with a sentence of a year or more.

6

obstruction of justice, burglary, they all require a

7

sentence of a year or more.

8
9
10
11

Theft offenses,

Also listed with ­­ among the generic
offenses is crime of violence.

There is a requirement

of a sentence of a year or more.
Arson is a crime of violence, and so ­­ so

12

Congress would have realized that ­­ that arson offenses

13

would ­­ would fall under the crime­of­violence

14

provision, and ­­ and for more serious State arson

15

offenses, they would fall under this ­­ this ­­ this

16

provision so that, for the minor arson offenses, where

17

there's a sentence of less than a year, the individual

18

would ­­ would not be an aggravated felon and would be

19

eligible for discretionary relief.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your reading leaves

21

out some very serious arson offenses.

22

law or under State law it could be the worst kind of

23

arson, but there's no commerce hooker and so it would be

24

left out, on your reading.

25

MR. GUADAGNO:

Say under foreign

But ­­ but ­­ but on ­­ on

Alderson Reporting Company

our reading, while ­­ while it wouldn't fall under

2

the ­­ the ­­ the (e) provision in the aggravated felony

3

statute, these more serious arson offenses, the ­­ the

4

State and foreign offenses, they ­­ they would fall

5

under the ­­ the (f), crime of violence, provision

6

where ­­ where there is a sentence to a year or more.

7

And ­­ and under ­­ under that ­­ that

8

approach, these less­serious arsons would ­­ would not

9

be aggravated felons.

And ­­ and individuals like ­­

like my client, Mr. Luna, who only received a sentence

11

of one day, they would be eligible to receive

cancelation of a ­­

regardless, what I'm talking about is ­­

20

You could still ­­ you ­­ one could still

JUSTICE ALITO:

But ­­ but

But what you're relying

21

is ­­ you're relying on language that is similar to,

22

maybe, and ­­ and maybe different in an ­­ in an

23

important respect; but nevertheless bears some

24

similarity to the residual clause in the ­­ in the armed

25

criminal ­­ Armed Career Criminal Act, does it not?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GUADAGNO:

Yes.

But I'm talking about

what Congress intended.

law, it doesn't intend for ­­ for the ­­ for the Supreme

4

Court to find the language ambiguous and ­­ and ­­ and

5

strike it down.

6

at what Congress's intent was, not ­­ not ­­ not whether

7

or not the crime of violence will still be an aggravated

felony after Johnson.

So ­­ so that ­­ we should be looking

fix.
JUSTICE ALITO:

May I ask you about the

12

statutory language that seems to me to present the

13

greatest problem for your position.

14

fatal, but what I'm referring to is the provision that

15

says the term applies ­­ so we're looking at whether

16

the ­­ the State offense here is described in the

17

Federal arson statute.

18

says, the term applies to an offense described in this

19

paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.

20

Maybe it's not

And then there's language that

What do you make of that?

It can be argued

21

that what that means is that, when you have a Federal

22

offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard

23

the jurisdictional provision because you're never going

24

to find that in a State provision.

25

MR. GUADAGNO:

The ­­ the language you're ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

you're referring to is ­­ is referred to normally as the

2

penultimate sentence.

3

sentence merely tells us that ­­ that State offenses

4

that are described in the aggravated felony provision

5

are aggravated felonies.

6

matter of Vasquez­Muniz decision, the board looked at

7

that language and concluded that ­­ that ­­ that all

8

that means is that sometimes State offenses could ­­

9

could be aggravated felonies, but it didn't require

And ­­ and the penultimate

In the ­­ in the board's first

10

that ­­ that State offenses always be ­­ be aggravated

11

felonies.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

But, I mean,

13

the point is usually when you see language, you know,

14

in ­­ in interstate commerce, your immediate reaction

15

is, oh, that's Federal jurisdiction as opposed to State.

16

But here the one thing we know is they didn't want it to

17

matter.

18

They said in violation of Federal or State law.
So as I look at it, the ­­ your instinctive

19

reaction is to say, well, then, of course you don't have

20

to worry about the provisions that's in there to limit

21

the offense to Federal ­­ Federal offenses.

22

MR. GUADAGNO:

This ­­ this ­­ this

23

language, it ­­ it ­­ it doesn't ­­ it doesn't directly

24

address jurisdiction.

25

that ­­ that ­­ that certain offenses, certain State

offenses can be aggravated felonies, but it's not

2

saying ­­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There ­­ this ­­ this

4

provision applies to an entire list of multiple crimes,

5

right?

6

MR. GUADAGNO:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

And so for most of those

crimes there is no jurisdictional element at all.

9
10

That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. GUADAGNO:

That ­­ that is also correct,

yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if you're looking at

12

this as superfluous to not this individual subprovision,

13

one subprovision of many ­­

14

MR. GUADAGNO:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Yes.
­­ it's doing a lot of

work.

17

MR. GUADAGNO:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yeah.
It's doing a lot of work

19

because there are a lot of other crimes that qualify

20

under State law, correct?

21

MR. GUADAGNO:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's correct, yeah.
I mean, your brief and

23

the solicitor general's sort of tunnel in on this one

24

provision of many.

25

But I'm wondering why?

I'm looking at the entire provision has many

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

State court analogues that don't involve interstate

2

commerce, correct?

3

MR. GUADAGNO:

Yes.

So ­­ so under ­­ under

4

our ­­ our reading of the statute, it ­­ it ­­ it

5

doesn't render the ­­ the penultimate sentence a nullity

6

because as ­­ as Justice Sotomayor noted, there ­­ there

7

are ­­ are many State provisions that ­­ that will still

8

be aggravated felonies.

9

mentioned the ­­ the generic offenses, all the generic

10

We have all ­­ all ­­ I ­­ I

offenses will ­­ will be both ­­ both State and ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But suppose ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What your ­­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Go ahead.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What your theory does is at

15

least create a world in which some things are included

16

and some things are excluded in a way that appears not

17

to make much sense.

18

reason for doing this with arson to limit it to the

19

Federal offense.

20

a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional

21

hooks in them.

22

Now, you've said no, there is a

But I mean, there are a lot of things,

So you would be excluding ­­ in addition to

23

arson, you would be excluding the child pornography

24

crime.

25

excluding felon and possession, excluding receiving

You would be excluding a kidnapping crime,

Alderson Reporting Company

10

2

would be excluding all of those.

3

So you

And then on the other hand, you would be

4

including some things that seem a lot more minor that

5

just happen not to have jurisdictional hooks, like

6

operating a gambling establishment.

7

So you create a world in which the

8

exclusions and the inclusions seem not to match up with

9

anybody's view of ­­ of a sensible categorization.

10

MR. GUADAGNO:

Well, the ­­ the ­­ the same

11

way that ­­ that ­­ that there's ­­ there's an

12

aggravated felony provision for arson in the generics

13

for all those things that Your Honor mentioned, that

14

there are other categories of aggravated felony which

15

would cover State offenses for those things:

16

abuse of a minor, crime of violence.

17

outside the aggravated felony scope, we have crimes

18

involving moral turpitude.

19

those crimes on ­­ within a State, they would still be

20

removable and they would still be removable for

21

aggravated felonies ­­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Sexual

And ­­ and even

So individuals who commit

Take two ­­ two defendants.

23

a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that may be

11

question somewhat when you say, oh well, there's another

12

section.

Don't worry.

13

That ­­ that does avoid the

That's your answer.

But that doesn't seem to me a complete

14

answer to the statutory question that Justice Alito's

15

question poses.

16

to the States.

17

You're making the statute a nullity as

MR. GUADAGNO:

19

of ­­ of the statute that ­­ that's required for a

12

MR. GUADAGNO:

That seems to me

But in this ­­ this Court

always requires the jurisdictional element for ­­ for

15

there was a conviction under 18 U.S. 844(i), and this

position, and as ­­ as I was saying earlier that ­­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The sole purpose ­­ the

3

sole purpose of it is to enable Federal authority to be

4

brought to bear on the problem.

5

to the conduct.

6

for the jurisdictional provision is to authorize Federal

7

action and nothing to do with the conduct involved in

8

the crime itself.

9

It has no relationship

The arson is the same.

The only reason

So I think a jurisdictional provision is not

10

like any other element.

11

only, which is to authorize Federal action.

12

MR. GUADAGNO:

It's there for one purpose

On Page 24 of our brief, we

13

cite three provisions from Title 18, two from

14

18 U.S.C. Section 3142, and the third one is 18 U.S.C.

15

Section 5032.

to Federal jurisdiction had existed.

very clear language removing the jurisdictional element

20

law.

And these three provisions have language

And I agree ­­ yes, I

22

agree with you, that's clearer.

23

say if ­­ if the jurisdictional element, why not some

24

other element?

25

unique.

But it still doesn't

Because jurisdictional elements are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

MR. GUADAGNO:

But the important point

2

about ­­ about those three Federal statutes is ­­ is

3

that Congress is saying that if they want jurisdictional

4

elements to be ignored, they're going to say so, and

5

they're going to say so with clear language, much

6

clearer language than ­­ than ­­ than the penultimate

7

sentence or described in, and Congress didn't ­­ didn't

8

do that here.

9

I mean, basically we're ­­ we're asking to

10

apply the full language of ­­ of ­­ of the statute, and

11

the government is saying omit things.

12

omit things, you need clear language.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And ­­ and to

No, but your

14

assumption is that there ­­ an element is an element is

15

an element, whether it's substantive or jurisdictional.

16

And that's not the way our ­­ our cases have treated

17

them, or ­­ or the general.

18

rely on it for ­­ for everything, but the Model Penal

19

Code draws a precise distinction between matters

20

relating to the harm or evil sought to be prevented and

21

facts that relate to jurisdiction, venue, or

22

limitations.

23

MR. GUADAGNO:

I mean, you don't need to

But ­­ but still, the

24

jurisdictional element is required for the conviction.

25

You ­­ you cannot have the ­­ the conviction.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, I know.

But my

2

point is it's required for a conviction.

3

doesn't necessarily mean that you would include the

4

jurisdictional element when you're saying, well, what

5

does the crime ­­ what is the ­­ what is the harm or

6

evil sought to be prevented?

7

this, it seems to me that that's what Congress is

8

concerned about, not the technical elements like, for

9

example, venue.

But that

And in a statute like

I mean, is venue an element if it's

10

listed under the ­­ the criminal provision?

11

It's an element that could have to be proved depending

12

tell me if I'm wrong, but jurisdictional elements are

10

different in one important way, which is that we don't

require mens rea as to jurisdictional elements.

we've made.

Yes.
The reason really is pretty

similar here.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the court:

6

Section 1101(a)(43) indicates that

7

violations of State and foreign law should be considered

8

aggravated felonies along with violations of Federal

9

law.

It was enacted against the backdrop of multiple

10

doctrines across multiple areas of the law in which a

11

jurisdictional element drops away when a Federal crime

12

is being compared to a State support crime.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All these examples you

14

gave me in your brief, either it's clear explicitly that

15

jurisdiction was excluded by the statute or the nature

16

of the offense gives jurisdiction or the Assimilated

17

Crimes Act, it makes sense, because the whole purpose is

18

that it's ­­ that Federal ­­ that a State law is going

19

to apply when there isn't a Federal law.

20

jurisdiction makes no sense.

21

MS. GOLDENBERG:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So applying

Our point ­­
But ­­ so I don't take

23

much from your arguments, which is the fact that it

24

drops away in other sections.

25

it dropped away here.

Congress didn't just say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

MS. GOLDENBERG:

2

each one of those is exactly analogous.

3

are so many different places where it drops away and

4

that that's very telling.

5

this statute is to capture people who are particularly

6

dangerous who shouldn't be ­­

7

Well, our point isn't that
It's that there

And of course, the purpose of

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I ­­ I thought ­­ I

8

agreed with that when I came in.

9

thought, my goodness.

And ­­ and then I

Of course.

It's an explosives

10

crime.

11

anything's an aggravated felony, that must be.

My God.

12

Blowing up a building or a person, if

Then the first words out of his mouth, your

13

friend's mouth, were, have no fear, read on, because

14

there is a section that makes it an aggravated felony to

15

commit a crime of violence.

16

is very broadly defined.

17

an explosives violation where that's a State law

18

violation will fall within the definition of aggravated

19

felony because they will have committed a crime of

20

violence.

21

And "a crime of violence"

So any human being who commits

So now, if that's right, I'm left with only

22

half the problem I thought I was left with.

23

half I'm still left with is, if we follow your

24

interpretation, what we will suddenly do is put into the

25

category "aggravated felony," which forbids the attorney

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official

27
1

general to exercise her discretion and keep the person

2

here even when she wants to, though the Mor case isn't a

3

problem, because after all, she doesn't have to keep him

4

here.

All right?

5

We put in every tax fraud state, every

6

racketeering, gambling.

7

it includes an awful lot of trivial stuff.

8

have removing the attorney general's discretion when she

9

wants to keep the thing here ­­ keep the person here in

I mean, you know the list.
So now I

10

a whole lot of trivial stuff, if I accept your

11

definition.

12

And

And if I accept theirs, I don't have the

13

problem I thought I had, which was that people who

14

commit very serious explosive crimes are not in the

15

category "aggravated."

16

So what is the answer to that?

17

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I ­­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't think of it until

19

I heard his first argument.

20

MS. GOLDENBERG:

21
22

I disagree with, I think,

both halves of that.
And let me start by talking about why I

23

think it remains true, despite the crime of violence

24

provision and other parts of the aggravated felony

25

provision, that Petitioner's approach is radically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1
2

underinclusive.
First of all, it's important that we're not

3

just talking about arson here.

4

of the different described­in provisions where there is

5

a Federal jurisdictional element.

6

things that it is clear would never be picked up by

7

other parts of the aggravated felony that ­­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

me, thanks to my law clerk.

We're talking about all

And so there are many

I have the list in front of
And I couldn't find

10

anything on that list which either wouldn't fit within

11

crime of violence or would be so terrible to leave out.

12

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, there are a couple of

13

different examples.

14

don't want to leave this on the table ­­ that not all

15

arsons would qualify as crimes of violence.

16

to get to that as well.

17

And I also think it's true ­­ and I

So I want

But the things that would be left out and

18

that would not be picked up by other parts of the

19

aggravated felony provision under Petitioner's view

20

would be a number of really serious child pornography

21

offenses if they were prosecuted by a State or by a

22

foreign sovereign, including possessing child

23

pornography, transporting child pornography, putting out

24

a notice saying that you want to receive or exchange

25

child pornography.

None of that would be picked up by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

anything else in the provision.

2

Petitioner says in his brief that the sexual

3

abuse of a minor, generic offense, would pick that up.

4

But it wouldn't pick up any of those things that I just

5

described, although, it might pick up some kinds of

6

child pornography offenses:

7

being a felon in possession of a firearm, being a

8

fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm.

9

of really serious gun possession offenses also, if

Gun possession offenses,

10

prosecuted by a State or prosecuted by a foreign

11

sovereign, would not be picked up.

12

actually doesn't contend otherwise.

13

A lot

And Petitioner

So it is an underinclusive approach.

And

14

that's true even with respect to arson, because under

15

the crime of violence provision, that has to involve use

16

of force against the person or property of another.

17

number of State arson offenses would cover arson against

18

your own property.

19

So if a ­­

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I think you'd have to

13

engage in an analysis at that point about whether that

14

element was a purely jurisdictional element or whether

15

it had some substantive force to it.

analysis ­­

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not an

That's ­­ that's the key

20

if ­­ if the board were going to undertake that

21

analysis, which it hasn't done with respect to anything

22

besides interstate­commerce jurisdictional elements,

23

which are classic jurisdictional elements.

24
25

But if the board were going to undertake
that analysis, I think it would look to the model penal

code definition that the Chief Justice pointed to

earlier.

3

4

power, jurisdictional power, to regulate that harm or

5

evil.

6

And that is the distinction between the harm

And in the case that you mentioned, I think

7

that might very well be a substantive element, because

8

Congress could be making a determination that if there

9

is something particularly pernicious, particularly

10

culpable, particularly in need of deterrence about arson

11

with respect to Federal property, which Congress really

The Court's ­­

the Court's decision in Jones interpret the reference to

interstate commerce to be something more than just a

2

jurisdictional hook, but rather a substantive

3

requirement that limited the scope of this particular

4

statute to more severe instances of ­­ of examples of

5

the crime?

6

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I don't think so, because

7

the analysis in Jones was against the backdrop of

8

constitutional­avoidance principle.

9

there might very well have been constitutional problems

And the Court said

10

with interpreting the statute more broadly.

11

the ­­ the best comparison is between Jones and ­­ and

again, I think the comparison between Jones and Russell

offense was something that could be prosecuted by the

6

property which was used in interstate commerce.

arson against a rental property versus arson of a

nonrental property.

5

can get at the same meaning using different forms of

words in different statutes in the U.S. Code.

I don't think it's possible to draw a negative

8

the Petitioner has pointed to that expressly say that

9

the jurisdictional element should be taken out is that

10

they don't have an analogue to the penultimate sentence

11

in this case, which shows Congress's intent in the

12

aggravated felony provision, that State offenses and

13

foreign offenses count, along with Federal offenses, as

14

aggravated felonies.

15

sentence in there, it may very well be that Congress no

longer feels any need to put in language that's

equivalent to the language of those other statutes.

position?

the difference between "described" and "defined," which

good distinction, because the "defined" only refers to

Are you

3

relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond

4

the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence

5

really the statutory basis for your argument?

6

MS. GOLDENBERG:

No.

We're certainly still

7

relying on the "described­in" language and the

8

distinction between that language and other language

9

that Congress chose to use elsewhere in the aggravated

10

felony provision.

11

important that when you look at the meaning of

"described in," it be read in light of the penultimate

sentence, in light of the purpose of this provision, in

are lots of places where Congress has used "defined in"

2

to refer to offenses and to mean exactly what follows

3

but nothing else.

4

Section 844(n) which actually refers to Section 844(i),

5

the provision at issue in this case, by talking about

6

offenses defined in this chapter.

7

And one very telling example is

So Congress had at its fingertips language

8

that it could have used to refer to these Federal

9

criminal provisions if all it had meant to do was to

10

say, look, we want you to use exactly what comes after

11

this and nothing else.

12

distinction as well as the "defined in" language in the

13

statute, and that's in Subsection (p), which is found on

14

4A ­­ page 4A of the appendix to the government's brief.

15

There, Congress uses the words "in violation of," an

16

offense which is in violation of a particular Federal

17

statute.

18

And there's actually another

The upshot of Petitioner's position is that

19

any time there's an interstate­commerce jurisdictional

20

element in any of the Federal provisions that are

21

referred to, only a violation of the Federal statute,

22

only a Federal criminal prosecution and conviction will

23

count as an aggravated felony, because no State crime,

24

no foreign crime is ever going to have interstate

25

commerce as an element.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

If that's what Congress had meant, if it had

2

meant to restrict it to violations of that Federal

3

statute, then, again, it had language at its fingertips

4

that it has used elsewhere in this provision that would

5

have allowed it to do that.

6

And there's one other aspect of the

7

statutory text that I'd like to mention, and that's just

8

a particular example of a place where Petitioner's

reading doesn't make sense in a ­­ in a particular

that's offenses described in several Federal provisions,

15

the provision, there is one of the limitations that

16

Congress puts in sometimes, and the limitation is that

17

the offense has to be punishable by more than one year.

So it

And what I'm saying is you can always impose

23

a sentence of one year or more as an abstract matter

24

when you have convicted somebody of a Federal RICO

offense.

And so it can't be that just because there's

an interstate­commerce element in the Federal RICO

2

statute, that, therefore, State and foreign convictions

3

all drop away and the only time someone is an aggravated

felon under (j) is if they have been convicted of a

Federal RICO crime.

If that were right, then there would have

been no need for Congress to include that language at

the end.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is ­­ it's a reason

why Congress may have used the language that it did,

rather than, say, just arson.

23

that it understood that there was a wealth of very minor

exclude those.

That it wanted ­­

43

essentially by saying, no, it's got to be the Federal

3

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I think that would be,

4

again, a sort of strange roundabout way to exclude them,

5

and to move it back through the crime of violence

6

provision, it would be a lot of work.

7

could much more easily have done is just to put a

8

limitation right there in (e)(1) as it did in many other

9

provisions that said you have to have a crime that ­­

10

for which you're imprisoned for at least a year, or a

11

certain value of property has to be affected.

12

What Congress

And Congress did that, not only when it was

13

describing ­­ I'm sorry, generic aggravated felonies,

14

but also it did it in some of the "described­in"

15

sections like Subsection (j) that I was talking about

16

earlier.

17

Congress would have approached it.

18

So that, I think, would be the way that

At the same time, I don't think there's

19

anything at all strange in thinking that Congress didn't

That's right that he can't

obtain cancelation of removal, and that's consistent

12

with Congress's intent in putting the aggravated felony

13

provision into place, which was to constrain the

14

attorney general's discretion and to make it so that the

15

attorney general was locked into certain conclusions.

16

And that was because Congress thought that

17

the way that the whole cancelation of removal process

18

was working before the aggravated felony provision went

19

into place was it wasn't working well.

20

were being allowed to stay, and too many people were

21

having their removal canceled.

22

very clearly in the legislative history that it didn't

23

like that, and it wanted to constrain the attorney

24

general's discretion.

25

Too many people

And Congress expressed

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Although, aggravated felony is a ground for removal.

fact that just because this Petitioner's sentence was

And

19

moreover, it has the limitation of $10,000.

So

20

therefore, serious fraud crimes will fall within this

21

other section.

22

When he wants to commit fraud.

And here we

So not even the case that you've really

23

brought up is ­­ actually needs this provision to

24

prosecute State explosives crimes, because either

25

they're against other people's property, in which case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

they fall within crime of violence, or they're against

2

your own property, in which case they are a specie of

3

fraud over $10,000.

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I'm not sure that

5

necessarily works under the categorical approach because

6

it would depend what the person was actually prosecuted

7

for in State court, and if they were prosecuted not for

8

fraud, but simply for arson, and it was a provision that

9

said ­­ that included arson against your own property,

10

then I think you wouldn't fall into either one.

11

But there's actually another reason that I

12

didn't get to before why I think some arsons might not

13

be crimes of violence.

14

uncertainty around this, but after this Court's decision

15

in Leocal, people are continuing to wrestle with whether

16

recklessness would count as a crime of violence.

think there are some, at least, forms of recklessness

And so I just think there is a whole serious

22

set of crimes that Congress wanted to include as to

of the proceedings and make them much longer and harder.

It seems strange to

I've never heard of such

I mean, I seized on the

14

RICO statute, but actually the very next provision in J,

15

which is Section 1084, the same analysis would apply.

16

Section 1084 is a statute that has an interstate

17

commerce element in it.

18

transmitting information for gambling interstate

19

commerce.

20

it is prosecuted federally and there is a Federal

21

conviction.

It has to do with gambling and

And it is punishable by up to two years when

22

So the same analysis would work there as

23

well, and that's something where I think it's pretty

24

clear that there would be State analogues to the

25

substantive elements of that crime.

Alderson Reporting Company

There would be

Official

50
1

foreign analogues to the substantive elements of that

2

crime as well.

3

I did want to pick up on one other thing

4

that Petitioner said in his presentation, which is, why

5

didn't Congress just use the generic definition of arson

6

here?

7
8
9

And I think there are a number of reasons
for that.
For one thing, I think it would have been

10

underinclusive because it wouldn't have included the

11

explosive offenses that are set forth in the Federal

12

statute very likely.

13

have reached that conclusion.

14

Or it's possible that courts would

For another, I think it would have

15

entailed ­­ and I know this Court is familiar with the

16

process ­­ it would have entailed coming up with what

17

the elements of that generic offense are, and that can

18

be difficult.

19

in the arson context where there are states that are

20

sort of all over the place and that has moved away from

21

the classic common law definition of burning of a

22

dwelling place.

23

I think it could be especially difficult

And so I think there are very good reasons

24

that Congress had when it found a Federal criminal

25

provision that had the substantive elements that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

wanted to simply refer to that Federal criminal

2

provision using the looser language of described in, in

The categorical approach says, every

But now you're

10

saying it's every categorical element that's not

jurisdictional.

12

Where do you get that from?

13

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I think the thrust of

14

the categorical approach is that you don't look at the

15

particular conduct that the person engaged in.

16

at the elements of the crime that they were convicted

of.

19

20

interpretation, what it is that you're supposed to be

21

comparing it to, that the Federal law is telling you is

22

the proper comparator.

23

And here, that's the question we're

24

answering.

25

described in means.

I mean, that's the question about what
About what it means in light of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52

penultimate sentence.

2

I don't think there's anything in this

3

Court's categorical­approach cases that would preclude

4

the interpretation that we're putting forth here today.

5

I just think it hasn't a risen in exactly this way

6

before.

7

But again, this ­­ the important thing about

8

the categorical approach is that you don't look at the

9

Petitioner's particular conduct here.

As I say, it's

10

not even in the record what his conduct is.

11

know is that he committed a felony under New York State

12

law that was punishable, my understanding is, by up to

13

seven years in prison.

All that we

14

And that's the only information we have.

15

And then we have to look at the elements of

16

the New York statute that he was convicted under and

17

compare them to the offense described in Section 844(i).

18

To the extent that the Court thought there

19

were ambiguities, we would ask for deference to the

20

board here.

21

think that, as the courts of appeals have said, that

22

there is one reading of the statute to which all signs

23

point, and that's the reading the Court should adopt.

But we don't think there is ambiguity.

10

2002 that are not reflected in the original decision

11

that the board doesn't seem to have considered in the

12

original decision.

13

So I just think it's the ­­ the

14

Vasquez­Muniz decision from 2002 that has an analysis

15

very similar to the analysis of the courts of appeals

16

that have found the statute unambiguous, have walked

17

through here in looking at, not only at the described­in

18

language itself, but at all the other signs about what

19

the statute means.

negative that the board revisited it and came to the

21

correct conclusion.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW L. GUADAGNO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GUADAGNO:

Congress could ­­ could have

13

utilized generic arson.

14

are references to ­­ to arson.

15

the Federal "Three Strikes" law.

16

"Three Strikes" law is actually a definition of arson.

17

Congress could have ­­ could ­­ could have referred to

18

the definition of arson in that provision.

19

Throughout Title XVIII there
Both briefs talk about
Within the Federal

In provision (K) of the aggravated felony

20

provision, it ­­ it discusses, first generically,

21

managing a prostitution business, and then it refers to

22

Title XVIII offenses regarding transportation of ­­

23

of ­­ of prostitutes.

24
25

Congress could have said arson, and then ­­
and then referred to Title XVIII U.S.C. 844(i).

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

55

could have combined both generic arson and a reference

2

to ­­ to ­­ to explosive devices.

3

With regards to the comment about not all

4

State arson offenses being crimes of violence because

5

some would involve personal property, that issue has

6

been resolved by the Board of Immigration Appeals since

7

1998.

8

the board called Matter of Palacios where the board held

9

that damaging your own property would ­­ would

Our brief ­­ our reply brief mentions a case from

10

constitute ­­ burning your own property through arson

11

would constitute a ­­ a ­­ a crime of violence.

12

With regards to the comments about ­­ about

13

"defined in" with regards to the INA, "defined in" is

14

used consistently to ­­ to refer to a definition, and

15

the congressional drafting manuals all indicate that

16

"defined in" should ­­ should be referring to ­­ to a

17

definition.

18

And my final point is that what we're

19

seeking here is ­­ is cancelation of removal,

20

discretionary relief, and that ­­ that Congress would

21

not have wanted to deprive individuals who have been

22

convicted of minor offenses or less serious offenses of

23

such discretionary relief and would want them to have a

24

chance to demonstrate ­­

MR. GUADAGNO:

No, I want to know where

As I said before, there ­­

MR. GUADAGNO:

There ­­ there is ­­ on that

one, I don't think there is ­­ there is any question

10

about that because there is a Second Circuit case ­­ I

11

believe it's called Ouch v. Holder, where ­­ where the

12

government did not pursue the child pornography under ­­

13

under the provision my friend is referring to.

14

pursued under ­­ under sexual abuse of the minor.

15

so that ­­ that is ­­ there is at least one case out
