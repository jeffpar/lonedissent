ORAL ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. KATSAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. KATSAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Second Circuit extended civil RICO to

12

claims involving foreign injuries, foreign enterprises,

13

and foreign patterns of racketeering.

14

wrong for two reasons:

15

cause of action does not provide redress for foreign

16

injuries; and second, RICO's substantive prohibitions do

17

not reach the infiltration and corruption of foreign

18

enterprises.

19

Its holding is

First, RICO's private civil

As to the first point, Respondents have now

20

abandoned any allegation of domestic injury.

21

fatal to their case because Section 1964(c), the private

22

right of action in RICO, is limited to domestic

23

injuries.

24
25

That is

Two related and mutually ­­

it?

2

MR. KATSAS:

The statute ­­ statute says

3

"injury," Justice Ginsburg, by application of the

4

presumption against extraterritoriality.

5

focus of Section 1964(c), and therefore, injury is

6

limited to domestic application absent a clear

7

indication to the contrary.

8
9

Injury is the

That is a straightforward application of
this Court's decision in Morrison, which says you

10

identify the focus of the provision before you, and you

11

limit it to domestic application unless Congress says

12

otherwise.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you're making a

14

distinction between RICO when the government is using it

15

as a prosecutorial tool ­­ tool, and RICO ­­

16

MR. KATSAS:

Yes.

Yes.

We are making a

17

distinction between Section 1962, which is the

18

underlying criminal prohibition, and Section 1964(c),

19

which is the private civil right of action.

20

provisions and statutes can have different foci, as

21

Morrison itself made clear in separately analyzing

22

Section 30 and Section 10(b) of the '34 Securities Act.

23

Different

And ­­ and here the difference between the

24

substantive prohibition and the private right of action

25

is clear from this Court's private right of action

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

jurisprudence over the last 30 or 40 years which made

2

clear that the decision to prohibit certain underlying

3

conduct is fundamentally different from the decision to

4

provide a private right of action for violation of

5

substantive law.

6

That's why Section 1964(c) has a different

7

focus.

8

Congress criminalized the conduct, it intended for the

9

private right of action to follow along to the same

extent.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Katsas, can I ask a

12

question that ­­ this is an analytical question, not

13

necessarily at all an argument that your result is

14

wrong, but I ­­ I guess I'm confused by what you said

15

now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter

16

of looking to the focus of the statute, because my

17

understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus

18

inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis.

19

In other words, once the Court had decided

20

that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not

21

been rebutted, then there was an additional argument

22

that had been made like, oh, this really does involve

23

domestic conduct.

24

to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the

25

extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the

And so the Court used this focus test

2

whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it

3

doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're

4

trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to

5

whether we look at that presumption question section by

6

section or for the statute as a whole.

But that doesn't seem to answer the question

7

MR. KATSAS:

I think the ­­ the rule that

8

emerges from Morrison is that what ­­ what has to be

9

domestic is the statutory focus.

Morrison is Section

10

10(b), and there were two choices.

11

of deception, and there's the element of the securities

There's the element

clearly.

18

presumption is going to operate, you have to figure out

19

whether the focus of the statute is one element or the

20

other.

21

therefore, that is what has to be domestic, and because

22

the transaction in Morrison was foreign, the application

23

of the statute was impermissibly ­­

24
25

If they don't do that clearly and ­­ and the

And they said the focus is the transaction and,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I ­­ I guess I just would

have thought that the question is whether these are

MR. KATSAS:

And it seems much

There ­­ there will always be a

question ­­ if you have related provisions, there will

10

always be a question of whether the ­­ the focus of one

11

element in a statute carries over to the other.

12

This case on the ­­ on the question of

13

injury, the issue before you is whether Section 1964(c),

14

the private right of action, has its own focus or

15

whether it just travels ­­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Excuse me.

Why ­­ why

18

Kagan is talking about, Appendix B of the government's

violence against a person at an international airport

MR. KATSAS:

MR. KATSAS:

9

Well, the person ­­ the person

The injury is to somebody

The person ­­ the person who

suffers injury from violation of that Act can't recover

under RICO, because RICO is limited to recovery for

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, business is hurt.

What's it doing in RICO

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

unless they want somebody to get damages?

2

MR. KATSAS:

It ­­ there are something on

3

the order of 200 predicate statutes that are in RICO.

4

And the Solicitor General's appendix has ­­ cites about

5

46 of them, which have extraterritorial application.

6

All but seven of those statutes have domestic, as well

7

as extraterritorial application, including the one you

8

just read.

9

When you look at the government's appendix,

10

what many of those statutes do is they take a statute,

11

statute has domestic application, and then there's a

12

provision that extends it extraterritorially.

13

what's quoted in the government's brief is the extension

14

for extraterritorial application.

15

And

So I think what your question goes to is,

16

well, what about the ­­ what about statutes that are

17

exclusively extraterritorial?

18

Only ­­ only one of them out of the 200 RICO predicates

19

was specifically mentioned in RICO as one statute that

20

it should apply.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are seven of them.

Okay.

23

9

the three.

10

Why would a human being ­­ now you've got my

question.

11

MR. KATSAS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14

Yes.
Why is it in RICO if they

don't want damages?
MR. KATSAS:

Let's ­­ let's talk about the

15

one that I mentioned.

19

application for people who suffer ­­ people who suffer

20

domestic injuries, and for United States enterprises ­­

21

United States racketeers who could use domestic

22

enterprises to violate that provision.

23

And even if I were wrong about that, Justice

24

Breyer, I don't think you would use the one provision

25

out of 200 as the basis for saying that the ­­ the

Alderson Reporting Company

11

statute that on it ­­ in the heartland of its

2

application will do lots and lots and lots of meaningful

3

work when it's applied to domestic injuries.

4

The related point, this isn't just the

5

presumption against extraterritoriality.

6

the background common law rule that causes of action to

7

redress private injuries are governed by the law of the

8

place of the injury.

9

We also have

Here we have only foreign

Congress legislates against the background

10

common law rule, and just as the cause of action in RICO

11

picks up background common law rules, approximate cause,

12

so too it picks up this lex loci delicti rule, again

13

absent some clear indication to the contrary.

14

When you look for a clear indication with

15

respect to the question of injury, not only don't you

16

find a clear indication of the contrary, you find in the

17

statutory findings in RICO a ­­ a repeated and specific

18

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING VACATUR

20
21
22

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I'd like to talk about both the enterprise

23

and the injury points, but I'd like to start with the

24

enterprise point, because Section 1962 most directly

25

affects the government's ability to bring RICO

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

20
1
2

prosecutions and RICO civil actions.
And as some of those questions have pointed

3

out, there are a number of predicates that are

4

incorporated into RICO, into the definition of

5

racketeering activity, that have extraterritorial

6

applications.

Some of them have solely extraterritorial

7

applications.

And that is a clear indication that RICO

8

itself extends extraterritorially to the extent that the

9

predicates that are alleged in the case do.

And that is

10

true both of the pattern itself, the conduct of the

11

crimes, and also of the enterprise.

12

that, if you look at the kinds of predicates that we are

13

talking about here.

14

And you can see

As was observed earlier, many of them were

15

incorporated into RICO after 9/11.

16

involved terrorist conduct.

17

which the provisions would operate and Congress would

18

have understood this is that they would have swept in

19

activities by foreign enterprises as well as the foreign

20

conduct itself.

21

those kinds of provisions in our brief:

22

the U.S. national abroad, taking U.S. hostages abroad,

23

shooting at aircraft with U.S. citizens abroad with

24

missile systems.

25

Many of them

And the natural way in

We've given a number of examples of
The killing of

There is another example that is, I think, a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

21
1

very clear one, that is Section 2339D, which is

2

receiving military­type training from a foreign

3

terrorist organization.

4

possible that somebody could go and receive that

5

training in connection with their activities with a

6

domestic enterprise, the very natural operation of that

7

provision is going to be that they are going to be

8

carrying out the affairs of a foreign enterprise ­­ in

9

fact, a very foreign terrorist organization ­­ that is

Although I suppose it is

10

holding the military­type training and has those

11

training camps.

12

And so we think that it's clear that the

13

provision has ­­ that Section 1962 has extraterritorial

14

applicability, both with respect to the foreign pattern

15

of conduct and with respect to the enterprise, to the

16

extent that a predicate with extraterritorial

17

applicability is implicated.

18

I've heard Petitioners talk about two

19

reasons why they think that might not be true, both of

20

which I think are incorrect.

21

could just prosecute the underlying crimes themselves

22

and not use RICO, and the other is that ­­ well, in

23

situations in which you have some people in the United

24

States, you could kind of break them off and call them a

25

domestic enterprise.

One is that the government

And I don't think either of those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

22
1

is a workable approach to Section 1962.

2

With respect to just prosecuting the

3

underlying crimes, of course the very point of RICO was

4

that Congress thought, where there were patterns of

5

serious crimes, that just prosecuting the crime itself

6

was not a strong enough tool for the government, and

7

that it was important for the government to have these

8

special advantages that RICO confirms in order to root

9

out the things that are causing these patterns of

10
11

crimes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But RICO imposes, it

12

seems to me, as we've even observed in the domestic

13

context, far more significant ­­ the impact

14

internationally could be far more significant than

15

prosecution simply of the underlying offenses.

16

obviously provides the government with extremely strong

17

prosecutorial reach and penalties, far beyond what the

18

substantive elements do.

19

shouldn't cause us to be more concerned with respect to

20

the comity interests that are at stake when you're

21

talking about extraterritorial applicability.

22

It

And I'm wondering why that

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I think, as this

23

Court observed in Empagran, when you're talking about

24

Section 1962 or something like Section 1962, where it is

25

the government that is choosing whether to prosecute or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

whether to bring a civil action, the government has the

2

ability, it has the incentive, to take those kinds of

3

concerns into account and to regulate itself, either to

4

be constrained in bringing that kind of action where it

5

might cause some comity concerns, or to deal

6

government­to­government with another government, to try

7

to make sure that those comity concerns are smoothed

8

over.

9

where you have private parties bringing treble damages

It's on the private side, under Section 1964(c),

10

actions, that the concerns about comity, I think, are

11

much greater, because private parties don't have that

12

same ability or incentive to regulate.

13

bringing actions, they are trying to get their treble

14

damages.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

When they are

Well, I thought this was

16

the same question, but I'm elaborating a bit because

17

it's both for you and Mr. Frederick's reading.

18

I thought the answer to my first question

19

would be that the government just wanted the forfeiture

20

provisions ­­ that's why it put them in ­­ or the

21

criminal provisions ­­ that's why it put these other

22

things in ­­ and you say, that's right.

So, I mean, what

2

MR. FREDERICK:

But, Mr. Chief Justice, my

3

point is that if you look at each one of the acts that

4

is incorporated and has an extraterritorial component,

5

there is a direct tie to the United States, and the

6

crimes have to be unindictable under Federal or State

7

law.

8
9

So with respect, I think what you're
hypothesizing is a situation that would be a null set,

10

and that's where these crimes are occurring in Europe

11

under European member State laws, and somehow there is

12

going to be a tie in to RICO, that wouldn't be possible

13

under a plain reading of the RICO statute.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because it's only the

15

statute that has the extraterritorial ­­ the

16

extraterritoriality built into them.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
Most statutes that are ­­

19

crimes that are punishable under RICO will have ­­ will

20

not have the extraterritorial provision in the

21

underlying statute.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

There are

23

roughly three­quarters of the statutes that are

24

incorporated into RICO that do not have an

25

extraterritorial effect, and those would not be subject

consequences.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

understanding of ­­ of the law of a lot of the European

appropriate.

4

If I could turn to the injury question, the

5

RICO statute incorporated language of the Clayton Act

6

which, before 1970, had been construed to permit foreign

7

plaintiffs to come into the United States and obtain

8

foreign damages as a result of U.S. violations by the

company in the United States.

10

The Continental Ore case, which was decided

11

by this Court in 1962, is directly on point.

holds that injury suffered by Canadian entities could

come in and come into the United States and get damages

There are six Belgium banks.

They are unindicted co­conspirators.

I ­­ I would assume that the

11

expert on the enforceability of judgments in Belgium,

12

Justice Breyer, and so I give you that answer.

I think that's what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

MR. FREDERICK:

Here is the answer, though.

2

The answer is that if those Belgium banks are in a

3

conspiracy with RJR, it surely cannot be the case that

4

U.S. law does not cover RJR.

5

If there is a question about the

6

enforceability of a judgment against the Belgium banks,

7

presumably the Belgium banks will make that argument,

8

and they will claim in Belgium that ­­ that somehow a

9

suit prosecuted in the United States in which they were

10

co­conspirators is somehow not going to cover their

11

activity.

12

Our point is that it can't be the case

13

where, for centuries, the United States courts have been

14

open to allow foreign plaintiffs to come in alleging

15

injury caused by U.S. actors under U.S. law, that

16

somehow we're going to read the Morrison principle as a

17

way of constricting the available remedies.

18

Morrison suggests that you would do that kind of

19

extraterritorial slicing and dicing, where once you had

20

concluded that the underlying action here was one that

21

observed and respected international norms and went to

22

extraterritorial lengths provided in this case, that

23

there is a tie to the United States.

And after Pfizer, a number of U.S. companies

that we have laid out in our brief ­­ and this is page

5

this.

exactly the opposite position, because the State

8

to go into other nations' courts and the availability of

9

our courts for foreign nations to come in for violations

And the hearings

And the State Department, Justice Breyer, took

11

12

the United States had brought more than 50 actions in

nations around the world.

14

And if you look at footnote 13, which is on

So the idea about comity is one that,

15

respectfully, is a decision that is made by Congress,

16

and it is not for the executive branch to change its

17

position for the purpose of trying to snuff out a remedy

18

that otherwise would be available to a foreign

19

plaintiff.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. ­­ Mr. Frederick,

21

I understand that argument with respect to what's the

22

ordinary remedial provision of a statute.

23

something a little bit more than that, right?

24

this statute also ­­ this provision also includes

25

substantive elements that don't apply except in the

Alderson Reporting Company

But this is
Because

Isn't that right?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

That's true.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So why doesn't that make the

MR. FREDERICK:

It could.

4

difference?

5

And, Justice

6

Kagan, if you were to decide that the three verbs that

7

are in 1962(a), (b) and (c), which are influencing,

8

buying, or investing in, had to have a domestic

9

component, we still would satisfy that, because our

10

allegations in the complaint are that RJR from its

11

corporate headquarters in New York and Winston­Salem was

12

engaging in those conducts to effect and corrupt the

13

foreign enterprise, or the domestic enterprise, as was

14

the case with Brown & Williamson.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we look just at

16

1964(c) and apply the Morrison analysis in a

17

straightforward way, would that analysis work in this

18

way?

22

There isn't any reference in 1964(c) to

So there is a direct reference to the definition

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45

that have a clearly textual extraterritorial effect.

2

I think that by incorporation, you would interpret it

3

that way.

4

So

And the second thing is that when Congress

5

used that language in 1964, it was tracking the Clayton

pre­understood meaning as to what those words meant.

8

10

And the Clayton Act had a ­­ a predetermined and

JUSTICE ALITO:

But at that time, RICO would

not have an extraterritorial application, would it?
MR. FREDERICK:

No.

My position is that the

11

­­ the extraterritorial application has gotten stronger

12

over time, but if you were to adopt the normal canon of

13

construction, which is that when Congress adopts words

14

in a statute, they carry with it the meaning that this

15

Court has given those words.

16

Clayton Act as they were adopted in 1970, and as Justice

17

Kagan pointed out, the case has only become stronger

18

with the Money Laundering and post­PATRIOT Act additions

19

of those predicate acts.

20

The same words are in the

But the third answer I would give you,

21

Justice Alito, is that even in Morrison itself, the

22

Court's opinion says once we have found there to be

23

extraterritorial application, it's not for us to be

24

deciding that there are different provisions that

25

shouldn't have that.

And that's essentially the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

argument that is being made as to take an extension of

2

Morrison beyond where the Court was ­­

And there were cases called

So the Clayton Act is helpful in one respect,

but not helpful in the other respect.
MR. FREDERICK:

And my answer is, Congress

12

has addressed some of those concerns in the antitrust

13

area with various amendments that affect ­­ that ­­ that

14

only go to conduct.

15

And classically, what Congress is getting at

16

is conduct, not remedy.

17

Congress has done in one of the antitrust amendments for

18

the Sherman Act was to say, we are only going to affect

19

foreign conduct if it has a domestic effect, but it is

20

still a focus on conduct and not on remedy.

21

very well­equipped to deal with this issue should it

22

proceed that ­­ there to be a concern, but Justice

23

Breyer, I would point out that it would be odd to

24

suppose that Congress is intending to turn the United

25

States into a place where criminal activities could

But in the conduct area, what

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress is

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

occur from the United States that was affecting our

2

closest allies and there was nothing those allies could

3

do about it by going into the United States and trying

4

to vindicate and ­­ and seek redress for those harms.

5

That would be a very, very stark departure from this

6

country's long history of having respect and ­­ and

7

provide a remedy for foreigners who are harmed by

8

actions of the United States and its citizens.

9

If I could just address the ­­ I think I've

10

addressed the Empagran question, because that's the

11

statute that was affected.

12

that the PATRIOT Act ­­ footnote 10 of our brief points

13

out that then­Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of

14

State, was very conscious of the effect that this would

15

have on foreign nations and foreign litigants.

16

the PATRIOT Act extended certain of these predicate acts

17

into RICO, he stated on the floor ­­ we cited the

18

provision in our brief ­­ the reason for doing that was

19

to give foreign nations that had been affected and who

20

were treaty allies an opportunity to come and seek

21

redress in our courts.

And if I could just note

The last point is that Mr. Katsas noted the

23

choice­of­law principle, where there is a foreign injury

injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would be a

3

The EU is here as a party in this case, but

4

take a look at what they said in many other cases where

5

they were in the more detached position:

6

in OBB, in Kiobel, in Sosa, and most importantly, in

injuries caused by largely foreign conduct.

in that case there would be a huge comity problem with

A third principle is the Charming Betsy

canon, that you construe Federal statutes not to violate

19

international law absent a very clear statement to the

20

contrary, and that's what we have here, because Empagran

21

says that applying U.S. law to provide redress for

22

foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would

23

be unreasonable, and therefore, a violation of customary

24

international law.

You also ask why draw the line at injury?

Alderson Reporting Company

Once you established the underlying, the underlying

First reason is that the decision to create

7

there's no private right of action for people injured by

The second reason is that Empagran applies

10

that principle to the question of injury, and

11

specifically does so with regard to the very antitrust

12

provisions that were in effect pre­1982, in effect when

13

RICO was enacted to say there's this category of cases

14

involving foreign injury where the government can

15

prosecute but the private party cannot bring an action

16

for civil redress.

17

And that's an important distinction

18

precisely because private parties are not constrained by

19

prosecutorial discretion.

20

American criminal law, but at least the government ­­

21

the Justice Department has to talk to the State

Department and take into account any comity concerns,
