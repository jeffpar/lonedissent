ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER C. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This Court has made clear that class actions

12

are only appropriate when the plaintiff's proof is

13

tailored to their specific theory of liability in a way

14

that allows class­wide injury to be determined in one

15

stroke, and that the lower courts must engage in a

16

rigorous analysis in order to demonstrate that fact.

17

In this Federal Fair Labor Standards Act,

18

the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue a class of more

19

than 3300 employees who occupied job ­­ more than 400

20

jobs which required widely differing amounts of time to

21

perform their donning, doffing, and washing tasks.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, is that so?

23

Because as far as I understand this, there was some

24

donning and doffing that was common, that is, there was

25

some sanitation and some protective gear that they all

Alderson Reporting Company

had to wear.

2

the night ­­ knife wielders and the others, but they

3

weren't all that different.

4

mesh aprons, and in the other case, rubber aprons.

5

didn't seem to be that wide disparity.

6
7

And then there was a difference between

MR. PHILLIPS:

So in one case, one wore
It

Well, there ­­ there are a

number of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.

8

First of all, if you ­­ if you just look at

9

the activities that Dr. Mericle specifically testified

10

about, for certain activities, he found some employees

11

who take 30 seconds to get dressed and others who took

12

more than 10 minutes to get dressed ­­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15
16

Well, but you didn't ­­

­­ in certain circumstances

in ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

­­ the statistical

17

mechanism of your own, you didn't have a Daubert

18

objection to the testimony, and you suggest in your

19

brief that uninjured plaintiffs are included in

20

aggregate damages, but you were the one that objected to

21

a bifurcated trial.

22

recovering, that has to be determined on remand anyway.

23

I ­­ I just don't understand your arguments.

24
25

And so far as uninjured plaintiffs

MR. PHILLIPS:

There are a number of

questions embedded in there, Justice Kennedy.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your own expert, a

case is we ­­ we cross­examined both their ­­ the named

What we did in this

10

plaintiffs, the four named plaintiffs who testified, and

11

demonstrated two things about that.

12

One, that in general, they way overestimated

13

their own time; and two, none of their times were

14

remotely the same as Dr. Mericle's time.

15

that.

16

So we proved

Second, we cross­examined Dr. Mericle about

17

his testimony and demonstrated again that his methods

18

were completely haphazard and scattered, and therefore

19

couldn't demonstrate.

20

And this notion that you patch over the

21

entirety of these problems simply by averaging all of

22

the times of all of these employees is simply the kind

23

of shortcut this Court has ­­ has rejected in the past

24

in both Comcast and Wal­Mart.

I'm sorry, Justice.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Phillips, I'm

2

completely at a loss as to what you're complaining

3

about.

4

That's exactly what you did.
And what this expert did ­­ I mean, as far

5

as I could tell, between your expert that you used to

6

calculate "gang time" and "K­time" did exactly the same

7

thing this expert did.

8

number, but you used fewer people.

9

expert used hundreds of people instead of the few that

10
11

you did.

You came out with a lower
At least their

I'm ­­ I'm just completely at a loss.
Would you suggest that if one plaintiff came

12

into court, that he could not use the ­­ this expert to

13

prove his case circumstantially to show that in fact,

14

the average is this, and he doesn't really know how much

15

time he took?

16

instead of 10?

17

When he does it now, it may be 12 minutes

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Sotomayor, I would ­­

18

I would ­­ yes.

19

because that's no more different than Employee A coming

20

into court and saying I don't know what I worked, but

21

Employee B, who does vastly different activities ­­

22

I would categorically reject that,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, no, no.

But they

23

know what they worked.

24

working over 40 hours because there were time records

25

with respect to that.

They know that people were

MR. PHILLIPS:

You can't estimate your

We ­­ we don't have any

5

quarrel with Mt. Clemens the way it was written.

6

Mt. Clemens made ­­ makes a very clear divide between

7

what needs to be proven, what the plaintiff's burden is

8

to demonstrate that he or she has worked beyond the

The

that's proof ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There were time records

to that effect here.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But there were a lot

of people who didn't work beyond the 40 hours.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

There were

16

200­and­something­odd people that their expert showed

17

didn't work above 40 hours.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

The jury knew about those.
And ­­ and the jury rejected

19

Dr. Mericle's averaging of ­­ of 18 ­­ 18 and 20 ­­ 18

20

and a half and 21 minutes, and we don't know what the

21

impact of that is.

22

What we do know is that Fox calculated that

23

a mere three minutes' departure from Mericle's numbers

24

dropped the damages award by $1.41 million, and dropped

25

the number of plaintiffs out by close to 125.

Alderson Reporting Company

So Justice Kennedy, the small differences
make a big difference in ­­ in this particular case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we go back to

4

Justice Sotomayor's basic question, that is, when the

5

government sued Tyson or Tyson's predecessor and got an

6

injunction ­­

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Right.
­­ what Tyson's did, it

had its own industrial engineer observe the workers as

10

they were donning and doffing their gear, and that

11

expert averaged the times that they spent.

12

to me that the plaintiff's expert here is doing exactly

13

the same thing that Tyson's expert did when the

14

government was bringing ­­

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

And it seems

And in some ways,

16

Justice Ginsburg, that explains why we didn't bring the

17

Daubert motion that Justice Kennedy asked about because

18

the methodology isn't inherently flawed.

19

with the methodology is it's applied to the theory of

20

liability in this case.

The problem

21

It's one thing for an employer to say, look,

22

we're entitled under the Department of Labor regulations

23

to average, as a mechanism for trying to avoid the kind

24

of picayune details and discrepancies that the Court

25

identified in Mt. Clemens and said those can be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

disregarded as mere trifles, we're allowed to do that.

2

And the effect of what we, in fact, did hear was to

3

round up in order to provide more time to people than

4

they might otherwise have gotten.

5

And indeed, if you go to the pre­2007 period

6

when you're talking about the people who just put on the

7

normal sanitary clothing, they were ­­ they were all

8

given four minutes of K­time when they ­­ it took them

9

all of about 30 seconds to do that.

10

So the idea that we could overcompensate

11

somebody using those kinds of data is one thing, but

12

that's a vast difference from saying that in order to ­­

13

to maintain as ­­ under a rigorous analysis the idea

14

that this can proceed as a class when all you've got is

15

averaging across the widest imaginable range of ­­ of

16

employees performing different tasks with different

17

requirements, and indeed, although I don't think ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Phillips, you say the

19

question is whether it can proceed as a class.

20

seems as though that's really not the question in this

21

case because of Mt. Clemens; and what Mt. Clemens does

22

is to suggest that certain kinds of statistical evidence

23

are completely appropriate in FLSA cases generally, even

24

if they're brought by the government, or even if they're

25

brought by a single person.

Alderson Reporting Company

But it

10

And so the question that you really are

2

putting before us is not a Rule 23 question, it's a

3

question of whether this sort of evidence complies with

4

the Mt. Clemens standard; isn't that right?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I would go ­­ I would

6

actually go at it the other way.

7

first question is:

8

in a ­­ in a run mine­case period under Rule 23?

9

seems to me the answer to that has to be no, that

I would say that the

Can you use this kind of averaging
And it

10

this ­­ this simply papers over the problems of the

11

class.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the Rule 23 inquiry,

13

Mr. Phillips, is always dependent on what the

14

substantive law is.

15
16
17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And then the question

is ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That was true in Halliburton

18

where we said, look, if we didn't have the basic

19

presumption, we would think of this as very

20

individualized.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

Right.
But we have the basic

presumption, so the proof is not individualized.
And the same thing, it seems to me, is true
here because of the Mt. Clemens inquiry.

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

worked the requisite hours in order to get past 40.

Mt. Clemens says that it's the

10

Once you got past 40 in determining exactly what the

11

damages would be, at that point it was reasonable

12

because we hadn't ­­ because ­­ because Mt. Clemens

13

hadn't maintained records to go ahead and give the

14

plaintiff a pass.

15

parchments test all over again.

16

It's the same ­­ it's the Story

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I can't see how that account

17

of Mt. Clemens would make most ­­ much sense.

18

suggesting that a person past 40 can produce the

19

statistical evidence, but if I worked 39 1/2 hours and

20

all of this overtime is going to push me over 40, the

21

Mt. Clemens presumption wouldn't be available to me?

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

You're

I think that's exactly the

23

line the Court drew in Mt. Clemens.

24

25

from parchment.

The point is we start

That's the substantive law for FSLA.

MR. PHILLIPS:

To be sure.

I mean, you can

go at it either way.

16

obviously, what ­­ as I started ­­ as I started my

17

remarks, is ­­ is that the Court ­­ is that the

plaintiffs are obliged to demonstrate that a class works

19

on the basis of the substantive liability that they have

20

to ­­ burden that they have to assume ­­

21

But at the end of the day,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

So Mt. Clemens says

22

exactly this.

24

are," quote, "'inaccurate or inadequate'" ­­ that's your

case, right? ­­ "then the employee attempting to bring a

matter of just and reasonable inference."

4

That's what it says to do.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And then it says the

7

employer can't complain that the damages lack the

8

exactness and precision of measurement that would be

the damages number that that expert will put forward

that means there are literally thousands of absent class

11

members whose ­­ who are ­­ who are either entitled to

or not entitled to damages without any ability to know

whether they were or were not injured.

14

under those circumstances, what this Court said in

that it ­­ that it protects us as a collateral

disagree with the 18 minutes, 21 minutes?
MR. PHILLIPS:

They had to have disagreed

plaintiffs, they ­­ they were significantly different

than the ­­ than the 18 and 21 minute times.

the ­­ the best evidence was, is that Mericle, by this

10

method of sort of ­­ of nonrandom observations of

11

self­selected employees, came up with widely ­­ wildly

12

extravagant numbers, and the jury rejected them.

13

was the plaintiffs' decision to go for the ­­ for the

14

entirety of the claim rather than take a more narrow

15

approach of maybe seeking walking time where the conduct

16

of the individual plaintiffs is much more homogenous.

And it

The problem with this is that it's very ­­
it's a vast ­­ I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could go back to

20

Justice Kennedy's question at the start, because it

21

really was your decision not to have a bifurcated

22

proceeding, where it would have been clear ­­ it would

23

have been proved separately in a highly ministerial way

24

which employees worked over 40 hours.

25

And having made that decision, you're in a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

position now where you're saying, oh, there's one sum ­­

2

there's one lump judgment; we don't know what to do with

3

it.

4

that it's going to go back in remand, and the judge is

5

going to do something that looks an awful like ­­ lot

6

like the bifurcation that you rejected, which is, the

7

Court will say, now we figure out in this highly

8

ministerial way who worked more than 40 hours, and so

9

who is entitled to share in the judgment.

10
11
12

But, in ­­ in essence, what's going to happen is

MR. PHILLIPS:

The ­­ the bifurcation that

the plaintiffs proposed, two things to say about that.
First of all, they took it off the table

13

themselves, not us.

14

it wasn't rejected because we ­­ we objected to it.

15

They ­­ they pulled bifurcation off the table.

16

don't think you can put the burden on us.

17

We did object, but that wasn't ­­

So I

But, second of all, the ­­ the bifurcation

18

they proposed was that first you were going to decide

19

whether Mericle is right or not, and that means whether

20

18 and a half and 21 can be averaged across your class.

21

And then the second part was going to be Fox testifying

22

about how to slot that in.

23

Well, that's not ­­ that's not going to ­­

24

it may help with respect to the ­­ to the uninjured ­­

25

to the injured class members, but it would not have

Alderson Reporting Company

remotely helped with the more fundamental question of

2

the inadequacy of this as a class action device where

3

you patch over the problems of this ­­ of this class by

4

simply averaging everything together.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it ­­ it absolutely

6

helps with the question, your second question presented,

7

which is this point that you are making that there might

8

be some people who didn't work 40 hours, who would

9

nonetheless get money.

10

that.

11
12

And it absolutely helps for

It takes care of the entire problem.
That leaves you with only your first

question presented ­­

­­ which is this question

about was the class too varied.

go back to this ­­ to this issue of, it's not a class

18

whether this kind of statistical evidence could have

been presented.

20

And on that, I have to

It's an FLSA issue under Mt. Clemens as to

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

Mt. Clemens one, which, obviously, I'm not persuading

says, you don't go to fair and reasonable inference

here, because it's one thing to ­­ to do some kind of

sampling.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Let me start with your question, Justice

17

Kennedy, because there absolutely will be remand

18

proceedings on the presumption that you affirm the

19

judgment of the Eighth Circuit so that the money can be

20

allocated, and we know the names of every single person

21

who would be entitled to an award based on a very long

22

spreadsheet that Dr. Fox compiled in conjunction with

23

Dr. Mericle's analysis.

24
25

And so you're right, Justice Kagan, that
there is a pot of money based on the jury verdict that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

will be allocated, assuming that the Court affirms the

2

class certification judgment.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there is no question

4

the money can be divided up.

5

can be divided up between those who were actually

6

injured and those who were not actually injured.

7

The question is whether it

So suppose you have ­­ if you have three

8

employees, one worked ­­ one was ­­ one was given credit

9

for working 39 hours a week, one was given credit for

10

working 38 hours a week, one was given credit for

11

working 37 hours a week.

12

additional time the ­­ each employee is entitled to, you

13

can't tell which one of those, which, if any, of them

14

was injured, and you can't tell how much additional time

15

the employees were entitled to without knowing what the

16

jury did with Dr. Mericle's statistics.

17
18
19

Without knowing how much

So that's why I ­­ I don't see how this can
be done in other than a very slap­dash fashion.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, there are two ways,

20

and I would submit that they ­­ neither is slap­dash.

21

Ordinarily, we would defer to jury verdicts, and we

22

would say that if the jury evaluated the evidence within

23

the realm of what was presented at trial, that is going

24

to get special deference in our legal system.

25

So when those monies get allocated,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

ordinarily a district judge is going to do so on a basis

2

either of pro rata for all of those ­­ all of those

3

plaintiffs who were found to be injured, and the 212 who

4

were identified by name, by Dr. Fox, Tyson knew about

5

them before trial, did not move for summary judgment as

6

to those 212, could have easily severed them right out

7

before this case went to the jury.

8

The second way is that Dr. Fox did an

9

analysis using Mericle's averages and then added them to

10

the number of minutes worked by the particular employee,

11

and so based on that, a vast number got above the

12

40­hour threshold.

13

Now, the evidence at trial that it came in

14

by Tyson's own witnesses was that the average worker

15

worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of

16

the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the

17

plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which

18

would be a 6­day work week.

19

And so the evidence as the jury was

20

considering it found the vast majority of the class

21

members were already going to be in overtime status, and

22

that's why the fulcrum of the case came down to whether

23

putting on this gear, which was standard sanitary gear

24

for every single worker in the class, was compensable or

25

not.

We're ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, we don't

2

know why the jury reduced the requested damages by ­­

3

gave less than half.

4

they thought the evidence on the ones who just put on

5

smocks or whatever as opposed to the ones who had the

6

mesh Armour ­­ you see, I don't believe what you said

7

about the ones who don't put on the mesh Armour, so

8

we're going to give zero dollars on that.

9

I mean, it could have been because

But I believe the ­­ the validity of your ­­

10

the experts' testimony on the ones who put on the mesh

11

Armour, so we're going to award that.

12

thought, you know, they would just discount the whole

13

thing, or ­­ you know, we don't know why.

14

Or maybe they

So because they used average statistics over

15

varying jobs with ­­ even your expert admitted varying

16

times, depending upon the classes, there's no way to

17

tell whether everybody who's going to get money was

18

injured or not.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, and Tyson had an

20

opportunity to ask for more specific instructions.

22

governing the trial.

3

they didn't ask for instructions, so don't worry about

it.

Because it's one thing for us to

5

MR. FREDERICK:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't ­­
It's another thing.

7

We need to know whether we should address the ­­ the

8

mechanism by which this was presented to the jury, and

9

then we can deal separately with a waiver issue.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Yeah.

Well, on the

11

substantive part, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say this.

12

That in all these instances where there is a challenge

13

between an aggregation or something where you could ask

14

the jury for a more particularized decision, there's

15

always a tactical and a strategic decision that the

16

counsel on both sides are making and the parties on both

17

sides.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That sounds like the

same answer you gave before.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but ­­ but ­­
Is there a

substantive?

found to have been injured.

5

answer.

6

That's the substantive

We have it the way ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

But I'm actually puzzled by

7

the same thing.

8

The ­­ there is a green room, a yellow room, and a blue

9

room, all right?

So put yourself in my puzzlement.

Now, we discover with our statistical

10

experts that in the green room, doffing and donning,

11

those people on average ­­ some more, some less ­­ but

12

the sampling shows it's half an hour.

13

it's 20 minutes.

14

So, we add those three numbers on to green room, yellow

15

room, and blue room people.

16

In the blue room,

In the yellow room, it's 10 minutes.

And we get a number.

Now, that number in individual cases will be

17

wrong, but that's what averaging is about.

18

is no other proof in the case, well, is that good

19

enough?

20

12

donning and doffing was occurring in different places

Mr. Chief Justice, that if you were on knife duty at a

2

think that, given the way the evidence came in, the

3

averages here are reasonable ones.

4

not a special Mt. Clemens rule where there's a

5

burden­shifting framework, the answer should be the

6

same.

7

differences among individual class members may be

is yes, and it depends, of course; you have to be

reasonable.

not sure that you've answered the ­­ the two substantive

argument.

13

Why did Dr. Mericle come up with one figure

for employees on the processing floor and another figure

15

for employees on the slaughter floor if, as I understand

16

you to have said this morning, all of the employees

amount of time on them, so they can all be considered

together?

to recreate what happened in a ­­ in a three­year period

And it was within

found was that there was consistency, and that the

differences were minimal.

The reason why there's a

a longer distance for walking to get to it, and there

is, you know, more to be done.

Thank you, counsel.

SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Justice Kennedy, I'd like to begin with your

question about the proper standard to apply here.

20

government thinks it's the standard that the jury was

21

instructed on, and this appears at JA 471 to 472.

22

The

The jury was told in this case that they

23

could only rely on representative evidence if all of the

24

employees performed substantially similar activities,

25

and that substantial similarity is what we think is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49

proper standard to determine whether an inference here

2

would be just and reasonable.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think ­­ how

4

do you know they relied on the representative evidence?

5

The number was ­­ was more than 50 percent of what was

6

asked.

7

for example ­­ they rejected the 18 minutes but accepted

8

the 21 minutes.

9

the damages sought seems to me to call into question the

10
11

The expert was cross­examined.

We don't know,

The fact that the jury did not give you

significance of the statistics.
MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, I think it calls into

12

question whether the jury agreed with the actual time

13

estimates, but I don't think it undermines the

14

conclusion that they found that there was proper

15

representative evidence here because they were

16

instructed that they couldn't award a recovery to the

17

class until all of the nontestifying employees, unless

18

they were convinced that they all performed

19

substantially similar activities.

20

So I think we have to infer that the jury

21

found that all of these activities were similar, that

22

there were not material differences of the kind that

23

Mr. Phillips has referred to today, because the jury was

used essentially the same methodology.

14

In that circumstance, Tyson thought that it

would be appropriate to treat all employees in a uniform

way.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We

You ­­ you agree it

16

would be an extension of Mt. Clemens to apply it at the

17

liability stage as opposed to the damages stage, right?

18

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think there's a way to read

19

Mt. Clemens where the ­­ this ­­ where it would not be

20

an extension.

21

be, we think it's a perfectly logical one and one that's

22

consistent with the rationale in Mt. Clemens.

But to the extent that you think it would

23

Mt. Clemens said that when the recordkeeping

24

violation prevents a determination of the amount of time

25

spent on these activities, then you should be able to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

come forward with a just and reasonable inference and

2

not put the burden on the employees to prove that time

3

with precision.

4

And when that exact same fact is relevant

5

liability insofar as it's necessary to prove that the

6

employee is pushed over the 40­hour­per­week threshold,

7

then we think that all of the rationales that animated

8

Mt. Clemens would equally apply to the determination of

9

that particular fact in that context.

10

But we think the Mt. Clemens itself signaled

11

that this might be an appropriate determination at the

12

liability phase because it recognized at the outset that

13

the burden of proving that you have performed work for

14

which you were not properly compensated shouldn't be an

15

impossible burden.

16

in the opinion.

17

Mt. Clemens decided it, certainly it ­­ it's true that

18

it should be applied in this context to the particular

19

fact that was relevant there.

20

That was the language that was used

And so I think that whether or not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm ­­ I'm going to try

21

to phrase what I understand the question my colleagues

22

have been posing that I don't think either counsel has

23

sort of gotten at, or maybe it's so obvious that we're

24

missing it, okay?

25

Clearly, the expert here, Dr. Joy, said ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

55

I'm using a hypothetical ­­ there's 10 minutes of

2

overtime.

3

of overtime is a million dollars.

4

back with half a million dollars.

5

And the figure that comes out with 10 minutes
Now the jury comes

How do you know that what they said is ­­ I

6

half the time ­­ five minutes, or the jury said, I think

7

it's eight minutes or ­­ for slaughterhouse and three

8

for production line people.

9

now, okay?

10
11

How do we know what ­­ how the jury
calculated that half million?

12
13

So it averages out to five

MS. PRELOGAR:

The answer is that we don't

know for sure, Justice Sotomayor.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's what my

15

colleagues are saying.

16

adversary is claiming that there might be some people on

17

the three­minute side who are going to come and collect

18

a pro rata share who really weren't injured because they

19

had worked 39 hours and 57 ­­ 56 minutes, something like

20

that.

21

this award pro rata?

22

So the question is, your

So why is it that it's fair to distribute this ­­

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, I think that it's not

23

clear yet exactly how the award will be allocated, and

24

those will be left to the district court's discretion

25

when the case returns for allocation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

At that point, Tyson can come in and it can

2

make these arguments if it thinks it's unfair.

3

district court will be well­positioned to determine

4

whether Tyson waived the claims by actually asking for a

5

lump sum verdict here and whether Tyson even has a stake

6

in this issue given that its own liability won't

7

increase.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Why would ­­ why would

dollars.

11

MS. PRELOGAR:

Exactly, Justice Ginsburg,

12

and I think that that shows that Tyson might not have

13

the requisite stake here to be able to challenge the

14

allocation.

15

But I think the overarching point to keep in

16

mind is that the ­­ the issues with allocating this

17

award were not the inevitable result of the class action

18

mechanism.

19

mechanism.

20

They don't reveal some defect in that

There were any number of ways to account for

21

this problem.

22

between liability and damages, as Justice Kagan noted.

23

That would have solved this problem entirely, but Tyson

24

opposed it.

25

the 212 class members who had no right to recover under

The trial could have been bifurcated

Or Tyson could have sought judgment against

Alderson Reporting Company

the plaintiffs' evidence.

2

It didn't do that.

Tyson could have asked for a special verdict

3

that would have allocated the damages by the jury; but

4

instead, it asked for a lump sum verdict.

5

have asked for the class definition to be altered in

6

this case to exclude those individuals who weren't

7

working the requisite number of times.

8
9

Or it could

Ultimately, there are any number of
mechanisms that could account for this issue, and none

10

of them demonstrate that this class action was improper.

11

They went unutilized only because of Tyson's own

12

litigation strategy here.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What happened to the ­­

was clear that you had to pay for actual time worked.

25

And, of course, the secretary has limited resources and

But then the ­­ the government

Alderson Reporting Company

can't conduct enforcement actions for every violation of

2

the FLSA.

3

But it is the Department of Labor's position

here that Tyson was in violation of the FLSA, both by

5

not keeping the actual records and by not fully

6

compensating the employees for the time worked in this

7

case.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you think an

employer ­­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

Go ahead.

What do you think an

12

employer should do about recordkeeping when the employer

13

believes that certain activities need not be counted

14

under the FLSA?

15

the employer is stuck with the choice that it makes, the

16

legal judgment it makes.

17

So is the employer ­­ it may be that

But is it supposed to keep two sets of ­­ of

18

records so the amount of time that it thinks the

19

employee is entitled to compensation for, and then this

20

additional amount of time, that it might be argued that

21

the employee is entitled to compensation for?

22

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, Mt. Clemens does make

23

clear that the employer is stuck with its mistake

24

because it said even when the failure to keep records

25

grows out of a bona fide mistake about whether the time

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

should be compensable whether it was work, that still

the burden­shifting framework applies.

But I would also note here that I think

there was no legitimate argument here that this wasn't

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

10

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

Let me answer Justice Alito's point and

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

the ­­ and the observation where ­­ I mean, the reality

14

is, is that in the Reich litigation, we were told that

15

the ­­ the ordinary sanitary equipment was not ­­ was

16

not within the donning and doffing requirements, and

17

never a problem.

18

frankly, we didn't monitor this.

19

And so as a consequence of that,

That's not a complete defense, but it at

20

least explains the sort of the equities of the ­­ of the

21

situation.

22

Second, my good friend tells you that the

23

district court here found that all of these things are

24

very similar.

25

the first time this issue came up with the class

The reality is, is that at Pet. App. 87A,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

certification, the district court said there are some

2

very big factual differences among all these employees.

3

And the basic ­­ and the only reason the district court

4

didn't agree to certify it at that time was because he

5

thought that the gang­time was somehow the ­­ the tie

6

that binds this all together.

7

Well, the gang­time was nothing in this ­­

8

in this litigation, and the reality is he made a mistake

9

then, and every time we came back to decertify this

10

class, based on more and more information about the

11

inadequacies of Mericle's evidence as applied by Fox,

12

who was ­­ who was essentially just wiped away, saying,

walking time?

Didn't they standardize

That's what I thought they used.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, and that's why ­­
There's a standardized

19

walking time because some people are faster than others,

20

correct?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But my point here is,

22

is that in general, everybody agrees that's a reasonable

23

way to proceed.

24

talking about homogenized because there are vast

25

differences, and the evidence is absolutely unsalable on

That's my point.

Alderson Reporting Company

Here we're not

Official

62
1

that.

2

And with respect to Mt. Clemens, in the

3

first place, I ­­ I don't think Mt. Clemens should be

4

extended to ­­ to make the fair and reasonable inference

5

standard of the presumption apply at the liability

6

phase, and I think the court was extremely clear in not

7

wanting to go down that path.

8
9

But second, even if you thought the
presumption should be applied here, I would argue that

10

the Mericle's evidence, as ­­ as, you know, through

11

cross­examination and examination of others,

12

demonstrates that this is not a fair and reasonable

13

inference.

14

are two quotations I would offer up.

15

And on that score, it seems to me that there

One comes from this Court's decision in

16

Wal­Mart, "when an expert's testimony does nothing to

17

advance a party's case, the Court can safely disregard

18

what he says."

19

And then what Judge Posner said in a very

20

similar FLSA case, "What cannot support an inference

21

about the work time of thousands of employees is

22

evidence of a small, unrepresentative sample of them,"

23

and that is precisely what we have in this particular

24

case.

25

With respect to remand, we would be happy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

for a remand to ­­ for allocation if that's permissible,

2

but as I read, the final judgment of the district court

3

is judgment of about $6 million to these named

4

plaintiffs, and that was affirmed.

5

there about how this is going to be allocated under

6

these circumstances.

7

got to be a separate proceeding of allocation, the Court

8

hopefully would order that, although I think there is a

9

more fundamental decision the Court would have to reach.

10

There is nothing in

So if the Court believes there's

And then finally, with respect to who has

11

the burden of dealing with this problem, it is the

12

plaintiffs' burden to sustain the justification for a

13

class all throughout the proceedings until a final

14

judgment is entered.

15

times asking them not to certify this.

16

in at the end and say, well, since we were able to try

17

this without any ability to put forward any of our

18

individual defenses with respect to any of these

19

individual employees, except for the four who actually

20

testified, is exactly what this Court said in Wal­Mart

21

and Comcast is an impermissible way to define the class.

22
23
24
25

And we came to the court four
So to come back

The Court should reverse in this case,
declare the class decertified.
