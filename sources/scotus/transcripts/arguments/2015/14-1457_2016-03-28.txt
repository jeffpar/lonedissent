Mr. Rowley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED A. ROWLEY, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We will hear

MR. ROWLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Speedy Trial Clause applies to a

11

criminal prosecution through its culmination in

12

sentencing.

13

or is found guilty.

14

guarantees an early and proper disposition of a criminal

15

charge, and that guarantee applies to the guilt stage of

16

a prosecution when most defendants plead guilty and to

17

the sentencing stage, which may be the only place in a

18

criminal prosecution today when a defendant actually

19

mounts a defense.

20

It is not cut off when the defendant pleads
The Court has said that the clause

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does the Federal Speedy

21

Trial Act ­­ not the constitutional provision, but the

22

legislation ­­ does that cover sentencing, or is that

23

limited to trial?

24
25

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, my understanding is

that it's limited to trial.

The Court has recognized

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

specific interests that are protected by the Speedy

2

Trial Clause, and those interests apply not just to

3

presumptively innocent defendants, as the State and the

4

United States suggests, but some of them apply

5

specifically to guilty defendants.

6

In Barker, for instance, the Court notes

7

that one of the interests that are protected by this ­­

8

that is protected by this clause is the interest in

9

rehabilitation, and that a prolonged period of detention

10

in jail can affect a defendant's rehabilitation.

11

that's specific to a guilty defendant.

12

Hooey, the Court noted that even though the defendant

13

had been incarcerated in Federal prison, that that

14

defendant could still be prejudiced by a prolonged delay

15

in the State prosecution that followed because it could

16

affect his ability to seek a concurrent sentence.

17

interest also is specific to a guilty defendant.

18

Well,

And in Smith v.

That

So the sharp line between the guilt stage of

19

a prosecution and the criminal ­­ and the sentencing

20

stage of a prosecution isn't supported by this Court's

21

speedy trial precedence.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with

23

the ­­ all of our speedy trial decisions say there's

24

only one remedy, and that is case over.

25

the only appropriate remedy.

Dismissal is

But you're ­­ you're not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

arguing that, I understand, with respect to sentencing.

2

MR. ROWLEY:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. ROWLEY:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
You are arguing ­­

We were not arguing that.
So it's different.

The

6

speedy trial requirement says if you ­­ if you don't

7

comply with the constitutional provision, dismissal.

8

But you're saying sentencing is not the same as trial,

9

to that extent, that the remedy is different?

10

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, at the guilt stage

11

of the prosecution, the outcomes are ­­ are binary.

12

the defendant is either adjudicated guilty or the

13

charges are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted.

14

there's two possible outcomes at the guilt stage:

15

or innocence.

16

So

So

Guilt

At sentencing, the situation is quite

17

different.

18

which is what the Court requires per Morrison; and there

19

may be a greater need for tailoring because the

20

defendant has been adjudicated guilty.

21

sentencing context where courts have wide discretion,

22

where there's a range of possible sentences, where

23

there's a range of possible outcomes, tailoring ­­

24

there's a greater opportunity for tailoring and ­­

25

There's greater opportunity for tailoring,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So in the

So ­­ so what would the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

remedy be in a case like this?

2

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, we submit that a

3

proper remedy in a case like this would be to reduce

4

Mr. Betterman's sentence by the period of delay, and the

5

Montana Supreme Court concluded that the period of

6

unjustified delay here was 14 months.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

another sentence.

10

Well, he was serving on

He was serving a sentence for another

MR. ROWLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

He was ­­ so

11

he got time served credit on the prior sentence that ­­

12

that he was serving.

13

14

bail­jumping sentence, which is the ­­ the sentence

15

that ­­ that's at issue here.

16

But that period of delay, the 14

And we submit that a proportionate remedy,

17

an appropriate remedy, would be to reduce that sentence

18

by the period during which he was denied access to

19

rehabilitation programs and suffered the anxiety that is

20

detailed in his affidavit, and that that would be a ­­ a

21

way to go.

22

remedy to sentencing delays.

23

outcome in another case would be simply to vacate the

24

remaining portion of the defendant's sentence.

25

The lower courts have applied that sort of
And another possible

But here we submit that a tailored remedy

Alderson Reporting Company

would be just reducing his sentence by ­­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you make of the fact

3

that the Sixth Amendment says that "the accused shall

4

enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an

5

impartial jury"?

6

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, the impartial jury

7

clause doesn't cut off or limit the word "trial."

8

know that because the Court has recognized that the

9

public trial right might apply at a suppression hearing,

We

10

and there's no jury convened at a suppression hearing.

11

The Court concluded that in Waller.

12

jury clause applies to the portions of a criminal

13

prosecution, the stages of a prosecution where a jury is

14

actually impaneled.

15

of an ­­ of the impartial jury clause, which was to

16

prevent jurors from offering evidence against the

17

defendant, it makes good sense that it would apply to

18

the stages of a criminal prosecution where a jury is

19

convened.

20

So the impartial

And if you go back to the purpose

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Rowley, if we were

21

to disagree with you and say that there's no Sixth

22

Amendment right and there was only a due process right,

23

have you waived any argument that you meet the due

24

process standard?

25

MR. ROWLEY:

We haven't included that.

Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

didn't include that in the question presented, Your

2

Honor.

3

challenge.

4

that under a due process analysis, Mr. Betterman

5

wouldn't be entitled to relief.

And the Montana Supreme Court rejected that

6
7

And that gets to an important point here
because ­­

8
9

It applied a due process test and concluded

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that.

Well, I ­­ I understand

So you're admitting you're giving up that its

10

analysis under the Due Process Clause might have been

11

wrong?

12

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, we are not

13

advancing that claim here.

14

significant difference, we submit, between the due

15

process analysis and the Barker test that this Court has

16

applied under the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right,

17

and ­­ and that is that under a Barker analysis,

18

prejudice may be presumed.

19

addresses specific forms of prejudice that may flow from

20

a delay in a criminal prosecution.

21

And so there is a

And ­­ and Barker also

The Lovasco test that is applied under a due

22

process analysis does not address some of those

23

specific ­­

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I agree, but why do you

think Lovasco applies at all, meaning that's to

pre­indictment delay where we were creating an exception

2

and saying generally you have ­­ the State has the

3

period of statute of limitations to bring an action.

4

MR ROWLEY:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your Honor, that line of ­­
If you want to cut them

6

off from having that right, you need to show actual

7

prejudice.

8
9

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, that's the test

that the Montana Supreme Court applied below.

It is the

10

test that other courts that have rejected the Sixth

11

Amendment's speedy trial rights application at

12

sentencing, they have pivoted to the due process test in

13

Lovasco, and that test creates a significant burden.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

For example, Mr. Rowley,

15

just to continue on this line of questioning, there's

16

another case that we have which dealt with civil

17

forfeitures, which is the $8,850 in U.S. currency case

18

where it said, Well, we're going to do a due process

19

analysis, but we're going to take the Barker factors as

20

our test for that due process analysis.

21

So I think one of the questions that Justice

22

Sotomayor is asking is:

23

appropriate here?

24

not saying that this is right, but even if there's ­­

25

this is ­­ falls within the due process box rather than

Why wouldn't that be equally

In other words, even if ­­ and I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

the Sixth Amendment box, that there's still a further

2

question as to whether the Lovasco approach is right or

3

whether this U.S. currency approach is right.

4

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, that's what the

5

Montana Supreme Court attempted to do.

6

modified the Lovasco test and tried to draw on Barker

7

principles in applying it.

8

results in this case to, say, the result in the Burkett

9

case where the court analyzed the specific forms of

So it eventually

But if you compare the

10

prejudice that are at issue in a ­­ a pretrial or

11

presentencing delay situation, and if you don't ­­ and

12

if you presume prejudice or require the State

13

prosecution to rebut articulated prejudice

14

particularized by ­­ it's been articulated by the

15

defendant, the court there found a violation, and the

16

Court here, despite modifying Lovasco, did not find a

17

violation.

18

protective.

19

And so the test is still inadequately

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm ­­ I guess I'm

20

not ­­ just not sure what you ­­ you mean by that,

21

because in this other case, the civil forfeiture case,

22

we just said we're going to apply the four factors of

23

Barker.

24

approach, I mean, it just wouldn't make any difference

25

which box it was in.

And if that were the result of the due process

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11

MR. ROWLEY:

That would ­­ that would

2

certainly be true, Your Honor, but that's not what the

3

Montana Supreme Court here did.

4

the factors in Barker.

5

straightforward fashion because it approached prejudice

6

the same way that Lovasco did.

7

defendant to make an affirmative showing of prejudice.

8

It required that that showing be substantial.

9

different from the Barker test.

So it didn't apply all

It didn't apply Barker in a

It required the

That's

And we submit also that

10

given the specificity of this right, that it's

11

enumerated in the Sixth Amendment, that it would not be

12

appropriate for the Court to shunt that interest, that

13

set of interests that are enumerated in the Sixth

14

Amendment, into the due process test; that the better

15

approach is to do what the lower courts have done, which

16

is to take the Barker framework, which already exists,

17

and apply it in straightforward fashion to a delay at

18

sentencing.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you're not asking us

20

to do it in a straightforward fashion.

21

Justice Ginsburg asked you, because you're giving up the

22

Barker remedy.

23

MR. ROWLEY:

That's what

Your Honor, the lower courts,

24

in applying Barker to the sentencing context, have fixed

25

more tailored remedies in recognition of the fact that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

there may be a difference between a delay at the guilt

2

stage and a delay at sentencing, because now the

3

defendant's been convicted.

4

And so the lower courts, in applying Barker,

5

have done this.

6

applied remedies that leave the conviction standing and

7

try to affix some proportionate remedy for the delay at

8

the ­­

9

They have tailored remedies.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They have

So why don't you think

10

that they've done the same thing under the Due Process

11

Clause, recognizing that it is unfair to undo a

12

conviction merely for sentencing delay because you're no

13

longer presumed innocent, you're now guilty?

14

MR. ROWLEY:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

The key ­­ yes, Your Honor.
Why isn't the due

process test that's being applied that modification?

17

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, the ­­ the reason

18

why the due process test, as it's been applied by the

19

lower courts, doesn't do the job is because they

20

continue to require an affirmative showing of prejudice.

21

So they don't presume prejudice which may be

22

significant.

23

Circuit that we cite, illustrates this point because the

24

court there didn't presume prejudice.

25

explained in Doggett, it may be important to presume

Washington, the case out of the Fifth

Alderson Reporting Company

And as the Court

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

prejudice because it is sometimes hard to show the

2

effect of a delay on the defendant's defense or other

3

forms of prejudice.

4

And so even the courts that have applied

5

Lovasco, and have modified it, still ­­ still don't

6

presume prejudice, still don't require the prosecution

7

to make a showing in response to articulated prejudice.

8

They just apply Lovasco and require an affirmative

9

showing of substantial prejudice.

10

So even this modified version that you see

11

in the Montana Supreme Court's opinion below, we submit

12

is inadequate and also not appropriate because there is

13

this enumerated right in the Sixth Amendment and ­­ and

14

shouldn't be shunted into the ­­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, when you say prejudice

16

should be presumed, do you mean it should be presumed

17

conclusively?

18

Could it be rebutted?

MR. ROWLEY:

Yes, Your Honor, it could be

19

rebutted.

20

defendant has articulated specific forms of prejudice, I

21

was denied access to rehabilitation, I suffered anxiety,

22

the State ought to be able to come in and rebut that

23

presumption.

And indeed, in a case like this where the

24

Now here, despite those specific forms of

25

prejudice being set out in the motion to dismiss that

Mr. Betterman filed, the State did not offer that

evidence.

5

that.

6

The first evidence that we saw was in the

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the State did

When you say that the ­­ the

7

remedy should be tailored, tailored to what?

8

what is the Court supposed to do, in ­­ in your view?

9

Select a punishment that is appropriate to deter the

What is ­­

10

State from doing this again, or select a remedy that in

11

some way undoes the ­­ the damage or the prejudice

12

that's been done to the defendant?

13

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, Morrison speaks to

14

this, and it requires that the Court fix a remedy that

15

is tailored to the injury suffered from the

16

constitutional violation.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Well, then, in that

18

situation, I don't know why reducing the sentence by the

19

length of the unconstitutional delay ­­ the supposedly

20

unconstitutional delay undoes the damage that's been

21

done by the delay.

22

MR. ROWLEY:

Your Honor, it's a

23

proportionate remedy because the defendant was denied.

24

Mr. Betterman was denied access to these rehabilitation

25

programs that aren't only good in themselves, as Barker

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

recognizes, but that also bear on his prospects for

2

parole, on his case for parole or early release.

3

the fact that he was denied access to them for a

4

significant period of time bears on his ability to try

5

to win early release.

6

that any amount of time that the defendant has to spend

7

in prison as a result of a Sixth Amendment violation is

8

cognizable.

9
10

And so

And this Court has recognized

And so we submit that it is proportionately
tailored, even if the fit isn't perfect.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

When Justice Ginsburg asked

12

you about the Federal Speedy Trial Act, and you said

13

that does not cover sentencing.

14

provisions of Montana law that do cover sentencing.

15

didn't you seek relief under those?

16

MR. ROWLEY:

But there are
Why

Your Honor, there are Montana

17

statutes that require that sentencing take place within

18

a reasonable amount of time and foreclose on reasonable

19

delay.

20

defendant was actually able to win some kind of relief

21

on the basis of those statutes.

22

Court decision below reflects, the court's view there

23

was that those statutes incorporate due process

24

principles, and so it would be due process principles

25

that provided the relief.

But we have been unable to find a case where the

As the Montana Supreme

prosecution.

It resonates strongly with Barker itself and

So back to Justice Sotomayor's question

about Lovasco, and about the difference between these

14

The defendant testified to that effect, and the Third

Circuit concluded that in the absence of contrary

evidence, that that was enough to state or to show a

17

Sixth Amendment violation.

18

The theory was he was denied access to

Montana Supreme Court placed the burden squarely on

Mr. Betterman to make an affirmative showing of

23

Supreme Court deemed it speculative.

24
25

So even though he submitted this

My problem is with this

Prejudice is prejudice.

And

prejudice means something like actual damages, that you

can point to something that I've actually been damaged

by either having served longer than the sentence that's

6

But why are you even taking on the

arguing that prejudice is prejudice?

say that the Barker test, including the way that Barker

approaches prejudice, could be actionable under the Due

20

Process Clause, that would be a different story, but

21

simply not the way that lower courts have examined it.

22

That would effectively give a defendant Sixth Amendment

relief under the Due Process Clause.

Now, if the court were to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DALE SCHOWENGERDT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Speedy Trial Clause does not include

sentencing delay because its purpose is to protect a

2

presumptively innocent defendant from the harms

3

associated with a criminal charge.

consistent with the text in history of the clause.

5

consistent with the remedy that this Court has said must

apply to speedy trial violations.

leaves defendants with other means of challenging

unjustified sentencing delay without requiring the court

11

The Speedy Trial Clause is unique among

Sixth Amendment rights because it goes to the heart of

13

the government's authority to try a presumptively

14

innocent defendant at all.

15

unjustifiably delays, it may forfeit the right, which is

why dismissal is the remedy.

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

I think if a ­­ if a

7

defendant could show prejudice, for example, if he was

8

not able to present mitigating evidence at sentencing

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

Ginsburg.

speculative a basis, you know, it's speculative whether

rehabilitative programs or parole would have been

available and whether the defendant would have taken

24

advantage of them.

15

He can first ask to be sentenced.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

General, there ­­ there may

16

be some real differences between the pretrial context

17

and the presentencing context, but one which seems quite

18

similar is the potential of delay to impair the defense.

19

So I guess I would like you to address that, because,

20

you know, as the Petitioners point out, in most cases

21

these days, most of the actual adjudication of contested

22

issues goes on in sentencing rather than at the trial

23

stage, given that we don't have very many trials

24

anymore.

25

And certainly Barker and certainly Doggett

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23

made it very clear that this was an important interest

2

in thinking about the speedy trial right.

3

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

Yes, Justice Kagan, a few

4

points.

5

danger is equally at issue in pre­indictment delay,

6

delay involving interlocutory appeal, which the court

7

held was not included in the speedy trial analysis in

11

Second, there's ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, doesn't ­­ Lovasco

13

really talks about a whole different set of

14

considerations in the pretrial context, which simply

15

don't apply once the indictment ­­ once the accusation

16

has been made.

17

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

Perhaps not.

But I think

18

it would apply in the ­­ in the interlocutory appeal

19

context or even ­­ or even appeal in resentencing.

I

20

mean, those same considerations would be at issue.

delay could impact or retrial ­­ if there's a retrial

How do you ­­ how does the judge know

whether ­­ if the defendant is brought before him at

year eight, eight and a half, nine, how does the judge

6

know that if the defendant had been brought to him at

year five, he would have given him a six­year sentence

8

instead of an eight?

9

Don't you think that there's a lot of

pressure on the judge if the defendant's hearing is

delayed for eight years to, say, time served?

12

really ­­ don't ­­ don't you think there's prejudice in

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

issue of whether, under a Barker analysis or any

analysis, he should be heard to complain about the

10

of substantial prejudice or actual prejudice should be

11

the controlling one.

12

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

I ­­ I think the court

said ­­ even the court ­­ lower courts that have applied

14

the Speedy Trial Clause to sentencing delay, they ­­ you

know, the Tenth Circuit, for example, in Perez v.

based on the Court's decision in Pollard, but then on

Because if that delay were

attributable to the State, it seems to me there would be

a Speedy Trial Act violation in that connection.

lower courts, when they're look at appellate delay or

similar test as far as the Speedy Trial Clause is

because it requires a showing of prejudice, and it

MR. SCHOWENGERDT:

Certainly.

There's ­­

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

To go right to Justice Kagan's concern about

5

the possibility that a defendant's defense at sentencing

6

could be impaired, we think the due process analysis is

7

adequate to address that.

8

because, although the defendant has to show prejudice,

9

the prejudice standard should essentially be the same

And we think that's so

10

one that applies in cases of other violations of

11

constitutional rights that may affect the defendant's

12

ability to defend at sentencing.

13

defendant should have to show that theirs is a

14

reasonable probability that the result would have been

15

different, the outcome would have been different.

16

is the same standard that's used in cases of Brady

17

violations of ineffective assistance of counsel.

18

one that doesn't require the defendant to show by a

19

preponderance that he would have received a different

20

sentence or anything like that.

21

that ­­ that he suffered prejudice.

22

when ­­ when you take all the evidence into account, it

23

puts the outcome in a different light.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

And that is the

That

It's

He just has to show
That ­­ that

And how did you see that as

different from what goes on under the Barker analysis?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think under Barker, the

2

Court does allow for prejudice to be presumed in some

3

cases, so the defendant does not have to show ­­ make

4

any kind of concrete or particularized showing of

5

prejudice.

6

sentencing ­­ prejudice at sentencing that the defendant

7

should have to show some concrete effect ­­ some

8

concrete effect ­­

9

We think that ­­ that in the case of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I take it that we've

10

said that that's the case where the delay is super­long,

11

so take a delay of eight or ten years.

12

why is it in that very extreme circumstance that the

13

defendant should make ­­ that the defendant should have

14

to make any particularized showing?

15

MS. ANDERS:

And, you know,

Well, I think the defendant may

16

well be able to make a particularized showing in that

17

case, but I think ­­ I think there are ­­ there are two

18

primary reasons that it's just not appropriate in any

19

case for prejudice to be presumed at sentencing.

20

and the first one of those is that, I think, you know,

21

the constitutional rule has to take into account the

22

wide range of sentencing proceedings here.

23

we're talking about pretrial delay, I think, you know,

24

all trials involve historical facts that, in theory,

25

could be affected, could be prejudiced by delay.

Alderson Reporting Company

And ­­

So when

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

That's not the case of all sentencing

2

hearings.

3

where ­­ where historical facts would not have as great

4

an effect.

5

the present characteristics of the defendant, rather

6

than on ­­ on historical facts.

7

There are fully discretionary systems

There are sentencings that turn mostly on

So I think ­­ I think prejudice should not

8

be presumed in any case, but in a situation where the

9

defendant actually will be affected, the due process

10

analysis is tailored enough to allow him to have relief

11

in that situation.

12

And I think the second reason it's not

13

appropriate ever to presume prejudice at sentencing is

14

that the conviction changes everything.

15

once a defendant has been convicted, there's a strong

16

societal interest in giving him an appropriate sentence.

17

And so to give him a remedy for presentencing delay, I

18

think, involves ­­ generally, the remedy is going to

19

involve lowering what would otherwise be an appropriate

20

sentence.

21

to require the defendant to show some actual injury in

22

order to justify the societal cost of lowering an

23

otherwise appropriate sentence.

24
25

It ­­ once ­­

So in that context, I think it's appropriate

MS. ANDERS:

They do, yes.
Your rule would apply to

Well, I think capital cases may

6

be different.

7

some context, for instance, double jeopardy, the ­­ the

8

capital sentencing is essentially, in some respects, an

9

extension of the trial.

I think the ­­ the Court has said that in

So in that situation, you may

say the same thing with respect to ­­ to speedy trial

11

claims, as ­­ as well.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

little bit more than that?

because the penalty phase really is a trial?

MS. ANDERS:

Could you say a

You would ­­ you would say

I think there are some respects

16

in which you treat the ­­ the penalty phase as a ­­ as

17

an extension of the trial, yes.

18

I ­­ I think, finally, the other reason

19

that ­­ that it's not appropriate to presume prejudice

20

at sentencing is that in the pre­indictment context, of

21

course, the Court has said that the core interests of

22

the Speedy Trial Clause aren't implicated; and,

23

therefore, even though that kind of delay, pre­arrest

24

delay, may have the same sort of effects on ­­ on the

25

trial that are ­­ you know, prejudice that is hard to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

articulate, that ­­

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In that situation, the

defendant is at liberty in a pre­indictment delay?

4

MS. ANDERS:

That's right.

And that's ­­

5

that's why the core concerns of the Speedy Trial Clause

6

aren't implicated in that scenario, that ­­ that ­­ the

7

Speedy Trial Clause isn't implicated because the

8

defendant's liberty interest hasn't been ­­ hasn't been

9

restrained by the indictment.

10

But a similar thing happens after

11

conviction.

12

cognizable liberty interest ­­ a cognizable interest in

13

avoiding the ­­ the detriments that can be imposed on

14

him as a result of the conviction and as an incident of

15

the sentence.

16

At that point, the defendant doesn't have a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we take out the

17

"presumed prejudice" which is not part of the Barker

18

analysis, it just says ­­ defines "prejudice," how would

19

using the Barker standard in saying, no presumed

20

prejudice, you have to prove some prejudice, how would

21

that change the analysis?

22

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think that ­­ I think

23

there's one other difference, I think, in ­­ in the two

24

approaches, aside from the presumed prejudice; and that

25

is what counts as cognizable prejudice.

Alderson Reporting Company

So I think

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

in ­­ in the due process context, the Court said in

2

Marion that the type of prejudice we're concerned about

3

is actual prejudice to the defense of a criminal case.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MS. ANDERS:

That's for the pretrial.

Right, but what that ­­ we

6

think what that means in the sentencing context is that

7

the defendant should have to show a concrete effect on

8

his defense at sentencing; in other words, the

9

probability that the result would have been different

10

or, you know, that he's been serving longer time than he

11

should have been.

12

that things like ­­ like access to rehabilitation

13

programs, anxiety, that those would not be independently

14

cognizable as prejudice under the due process inquiry.

15

But I think it also means that ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You think that if a

16

defendant was writing to a judge every week saying, I'm

17

anxious, I really need to know what my sentence is, and

18

the judge ignores it for a period of time, that that

defendant still has to prove something more?

22

23

elapsed in this sentence.

24
25

That's not

There was no complaint for nine

So whatever treatment the defendant started,

But you don't think that defendant is
entitled to any consideration by a ­­ a trial court, or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

44
1

that we should be barring a trial court from considering

2

that?

3

MS. ANDERS:

And two points with respect to

4

that.

5

asking for sentencing and the court is ignoring that,

6

that would be inappropriate.

7

obviously have ­­ have other remedies, I think, at that

8

point after requesting sentence, perhaps mandamus,

9

perhaps a habeas petition.

I mean, certainly if a ­­ if a defendant is

10

The defendant would

But if all ­­ if the only prejudice he's

11

claiming is anxiety, then ­­ then yes, I do think that

12

that would not be cognizable under due process.

13

think that's ­­ that's really because once a defendant

14

has been convicted, he can ­­ he now can be sentenced.

15

He can be subject to the practical deprivations that are

16

an incident of sentence.

17

has been sentenced, of course, he doesn't have an

18

interest in not being anxious, that kind of thing.

19

so I think it would be very odd to say that he has a ­­

20

a sentencing delay­related interest in that kind of

21

claim that could be the basis for a constitutional

22

violation.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I

And I ­­ I think that after he

And

Ms. Anders, I'm sorry, one

24

of the things that strikes me as odd about your argument

25

is that you are suggesting that a remedy would be

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45

2

put this under the Due Process Clause.

3

what's odd is that, as you say, that in this

4

post­conviction context, the president ­­ the ­­ the

5

defendant has been deprived of any liberty interest, and

6

yet the Due Process Clause talks about a deprivation of

7

liberty, but the defendant no longer has a liberty

You just want to
And what's ­­

So it seems a very odd place to park this

right and this remedy, the Due Process Clause, in this

context.

13

the ­­ on the view that the ­­ that the trial has to do

14

with both the adjudication of guilt and the

determination of the proper sentence.

16

It seems much more natural that you would do

MS. ANDERS:

Well, two points with respect

17

to that.

18

use the standard that ­­ that we propose, so essentially

19

no presumed prejudice, only certain things are

20

cognizable as prejudice, and ­­ and the remedy would not

probably wouldn't have a practical objection to calling

I think if the Court were to say ­­ to ­­ to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRED A. ROWLEY, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROWLEY:

The standard for prejudice

20

articulated by the United States shows well why due

21

process protections are ill­suited to the specific

22

interests protected by the speedy trial right.

23

United States suggested that the defendant would have to

24

show that the outcome would have been different,

25

consistent with Lovasco.

The

The only form of prejudice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

that would be cognizable under that test is an effect on

2

the defendant's defense at sentence.

3

But as Barker illustrates, and Smith v.

4

Hooey also illustrates, there are other forms of

5

prejudice that are specific to the Speedy Trial Clause

6

that may apply to a defendant and, indeed, may apply to

7

a defendant even after they've been convicted.

8
9

So, for example, in Smith v. Hooey, the
defendant had already been incarcerated on a prior

10

Federal charge.

11

already impinged, and yet the Court noted that the delay

12

from the follow­on prosecution could still prejudice

13

him.

That defendant's liberty interests were

14

So this notion that you would apply the due

15

process test or the Lovasco test and require a showing,

16

an affirmative showing that the defendant would have had

17

a different outcome at sentencing but for the delay

18

really highlights why due process is inadequately

19

suited.

20

Justice Kagan's question points to another

21

anomaly in the test that has been proposed by the

22

government because of this focus on liberty interests.

23

And in ­­ in Smith v. Hooey, the defendant had

24

already ­­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or I suppose if it isn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

liberty, it's not incorporated under the Fourteenth

2

Amendment, anyway.

3

MR. ROWLEY:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor, but ­­ but ­­
I mean, the Sixth

5

Amendment applies only to the Federal government, and

6

it's only because of the Fourteenth Amendment liberty

7

that it applies to the States.

8
9

MR. ROWLEY:

So liberty is involved.

Yes, Your Honor, but the ­­ the

position that the State of Montana and the United States

10

has taken is that at sentencing, once a defendant has

11

been convicted, they don't have a specific liberty

12

interest of the kind that was recognized in Barker and

13

the kind that was recognized in Smith v. Hooey; and that

14

is the interest in rehabilitation, in accessing

15

rehabilitation programs that could be affected by a

16

delay in a prosecution.

21

MR. ROWLEY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't think he

Well ­­
And ­­ and then the

23

question is:

24

deprivation of his liberty without due process?

25

the Due Process Clause would require application of

Because

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

sentencing under ­­ and when it's ­­ it's not due

2

process when, say, Barker v. Wingo or some violation is

3

violated.

4

I don't see a problem with liberty.
MR. ROWLEY:

Well, Your Honor, the point is

5

simply that the Speedy Trial test that the court

6

articulated in Barker is better suited to the specific

7

forms of prejudice that are at issue in this case,

8

because it addresses this concern with even a defendant

9

who's been guilty, accessing rehabilitation programs, or

10

the anxiety that that defendant may feel at the

11

sentencing stage.

12

And this gets to another point that the

13

United States made, and that is that ­­ that the

14

conviction changes everything, because the concerns that

15

the court articulated in Barker may yet be more

16

significant at the sentencing stage, given that most

17

convictions today result from guilty pleas.

18

And so the fact that a defendant ­­ their

19

defense may be impaired by a delay in criminal

20

proceedings, may be more significant at the sentencing

21

stage because it may be the only place where the

22

defendant challenges an upward adjustment or contests

23

facts.

24
25

The fact that the defendant may need to
access rehabilitation programs may be more pronounced at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50
1

sentencing because the defendant's already been

2

convicted, they're going to serve time, and they want to

3

get access to the programs that they'll need to get

4

parole as soon as ­­ as possible.

5

So we submit that ­­ that Barker is the

6

appropriate test; that if the Court agrees that

7

Barker ­­ Barker's the appropriate framework, that the

8

proper right to ground that analysis in is the Sixth

9

Amendment and not the Due Process Clause.

10

And that is particularly so because of the

11

antecedents of the Due Process Clause which ­­ which

12

apply, not just to the ­­ the guilt stage of the

13

prosecution, but also to sentencing.

14

at ­­ at common law, and at the time of the Framing ­­
