Mr. Landau.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

This case turns on the straightforward point

12

that the people of Puerto Rico are the source of

13

authority for the laws of Puerto Rico.

14

a prior Federal conviction has no Double Jeopardy

15

implications for the enforcement of the Commonwealth's

16

criminal laws because Commonwealth law and Federal law

17

emanate from different sources of authority:

18

of Puerto Rico on the one hand and Congress on the

19

other.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That means that

The people

Mr. Landau, could

21

Congress amend 48 U.S.C. 1704, which covers Guam, the

22

Virgin Islands, American Samoa?

23

statute and put Puerto Rico in there as well?

24
25

MR. LANDAU:

Could it amend that

It could certainly amend that

statute, Your Honor, with respect to Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

prosecutions in Puerto Rico pursuant to its authority

2

over Federal prosecutors.

3
4

Your question, Your Honor, raises a very
intricate question with ­­ with ­­

5
6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In ­­ in the statute

is ­­ it works both ways.

7

MR. LANDAU:

In the statute, Your Honor, it

8

does because there's no question Puerto Rico is in a

9

unique status different than Guam, the Virgin Islands,

10

and American Samoa precisely because those are all

11

territories governed, as traditionally, by organic acts

12

of Congress.

13

15
16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is there ­­ is

there ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What ­­ what about the

Northern Marianas?
MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, they are in an

18

interesting position that is generally more analogous to

19

Puerto Rico in the sense that they are a Commonwealth of

20

the Northern Marianas with a compact of their own that

21

was very much modeled on Puerto Rico, although it's

22

somewhat different than the Puerto Rico model.

23

there's a profound distinction that goes to the heart of

24

this case between the home rule territories, were

25

Congress, to be sure, has delegated a measure of

Alderson Reporting Company

But

self­government to those particular territories, but

2

each of them, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American

3

Samoa are still governed by organic acts of Congress, as

4

was Puerto Rico prior to 1952.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Landau, could you

6

finish your answer to my question?

7

as what the federal Congress can deal with, what the

8

federal prosecutors do, but the statute works both ways.

9
10

You said yes, as far

Are you saying it couldn't ­­ Congress has
no power to do that with respect to Puerto Rico?

11

MR. LANDAU:

I would say, Your Honor, that

12

that raises a very interesting and tricky issue with

13

respect to the compact that the 1950 Public Law 600

14

offered the people of Puerto Rico that was accepted.

15

this Court said in the Flores de Otero case in the

16

1970s ­­

18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're saying it's a hard

question, but you haven't given me ­­
MR. LANDAU:

Well, I ­­ I ­­ I think the

20

answer is probably not, insofar as this Court said ­­

21

and I'm not saying this myself.

22

Congress relinquished control over the organization of

23

the internal affairs of the Island.

24
25

As

I'm quoting this Court.

Now, one point to make very, very clear:
Our position today on the double jeopardy issue does not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6

turn on that relinquishing issue.

2

hypothetical specifically, if Congress started to tell

3

the Puerto Rico prosecutors what cases they may

4

prosecute, that might raise some serious questions

5

under ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
it is.

Just take the statute as

8

MR. LANDAU:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

But to answer your

Right ­­
­­ not telling

prosecutors what to do in a particular case.

11

MR. LANDAU:

Well, and ­­ and, again, Your

12

Honor, I think the critical point here, and I think what

13

is most telling going back to some of the colloquy that

14

just happened in the other case, Congress since 1952 has

15

never attempted to do anything like that, to tell the

16

people ­­ to exercise control over what the government

17

officials in Puerto Rico ­­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20
21
22

couldn't.

That doesn't mean it

That doesn't mean it couldn't change the law.
Is it essential to your case that we

recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign?
MR. LANDAU: It is not essential that you

23

recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign with a capital "S,"

24

because if you get 12 political ­­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's our usual double

jeopardy law, isn't it?

2

MR. LANDAU:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

It ­­ it is ­­
­­ two sovereigns, it's a

different matter.

5

MR. LANDAU:

It is the shorthand that this

6

Court has typically used, the dual sovereignty doctrine.

7

But the court made clear this is the lesson of the

8

Wheeler case where the court was ­­ the Ninth Circuit

9

said, gee, these Indian tribes don't look like

10

sovereigns to us, because they are subject to the

11

plenary control of Congress.

12

typically think of as sovereigns.

13

That's not what we

And this Court says you're missing the

14

point, Ninth Circuit.

15

double jeopardy, the language we are construing is the

16

same offense.

17

entities are not the same offense if they flow from

18

different sources of court.

19

What we mean in the context of

Laws ­­ offences created by two different

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't understand how

20

that helps you, Mr. Landau.

21

is what the source of authority is, and you're saying

22

that the source of authority here is the Puerto Rican

23

people.

24

MR. LANDAU:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You're saying that the test

Correct.
But that seems to be just ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

you're not taking another step back.

What's the source

2

of authority of Puerto Rican people?

The source of

3

authority of Puerto Rican people was a Congressional

4

act.

5

is Congress.

If you go back, the ultimate source of authority

6

MR. LANDAU:

That, Your Honor, is the crux

7

of the case.

8

suggestion that the ultimate source here is Congress.

9

Congress could be ­­ what Your Honor just described is

And with all respect, I disagree with the

10

very much like a home rule jurisdiction, where, let's

11

say, you have the Virgin Islands legislature that passes

12

a Virgin Islands law.

13

Islands is itself a creature of Congress, as was the

14

government of the Philippines in the early 1900s, and

15

Puerto Rico in '30s at the time of the Shell case.

16

But that government of the Virgin

What made all the difference in the world,

17

Your Honor, was in 1950 to '52 Congress said, we

18

recognize and fully endorse the government ­­ the

19

concept of government by consent.

20

delegating authority to

21

So we are not

­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but Congress today, if

22

it felt like it ­­ and of course it won't.

23

felt like it, could Congress go back on that decision?

24
25

MR. LANDAU:

But if it

Well, this then goes to the

relinquishment issue, Your Honor, in terms of what is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

the nature of the compact.

2

emotional and hot­button issue in Puerto Rico.

3

Judge McGruder noted in his article in 1953 already,

4

there were divergent views at the time from the very

5

outset on whether ­­

Do you then lose your

As Chief

that Congress could rescind the existing compact.

8

10

This has been a very

MR. LANDAU:

Absolutely not, Your Honor. And

that is ­­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. LANDAU:

Why?

Because this is, again, the

15

lesson of Wheeler.

16

plenary congressional control over the Indians ­­ over

17

the Indian tribes meant that Congress could abrogate

18

Indian sovereign immunity with the stroke of a pen, and

19

even abrogate the tribes and derecognize the tribes.

20

But that didn't mean that the existing tribal laws at

21

the time were not considered the laws of the separate

22

tribes ­­

23

It was uncontested in Wheeler that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there ­­ you know,

24

"sovereignty" is a slippery word.

25

framers didn't use it in the constitution.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's why the

2

Are you suggesting there's kind of a second
class sovereignty and a first class sovereignty?

3

MR. LANDAU:

Well, Your Honor, I ­­ I

4

couldn't agree more with your insight, that

5

"sovereignty" is a slippery word.

6

political philosophers, they would all give you a

7

different answer as to what "sovereignty" means.

8

think that is precisely why Wheeler said we can't have

9

judges and courts trying to decide double jeopardy

If you got 12

And I

10

questions by asking abstract questions of sovereignty,

11

because, you know, even the State sovereignty is

12

different than the sovereignty of the independent

13

nations.

14

what this Court has made clear is that the test in the

15

double jeopardy context is all about the source of

16

authority for the laws.

17

They don't have ambassadors, et cetera.

So

And going back to Justice Kagan's question,

18

which I think cuts to the heart of the case, in this

19

particular case Congress said, we ­­ and this is

20

pursuant to demands for ­­ by the people of Puerto Rico

21

for government by consent.

22

said, we are tired of being a colony.

23

our own government.

24

Rico could not be more explicit on this score, that it

says, "The political power of the Commonwealth emanates

And that was the position

That position did not command a majority,

And that ­­ that is true in about 21 states, that as a

matter of State law, either statutory or constitutional,

Mr. Landau, there's

21

something you said that resonates with me, 'cause I've

22

been trying to find a definition of "sovereignty."

one has been created in the briefing by saying that

24

states are sovereign; yet if you look at international

usage, they wouldn't consider states necessarily

MR. LANDAU:

To ­­ to take your ­­ your

18

question in turn, Your Honor, this Court has made it

19

clear in a series of cases starting in Wheeler in 1978

20

that really tries to synthesize what the Court has been

21

saying with respect to the dual sovereignty doctrine

22

over a century.

23

And what the Court said is, in the Double

24

Jeopardy context, we are trying to decide whether two

25

offenses from different entities are the same offense.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14

That has traditionally been called "dual sovereignty."

13

Double Jeopardy Clause purposes, sovereignty means, one,

14

that the separate entity possesses the authority to

15

determine what shall be an ­­ an offense against their

16

peace and dignity; two, can enact laws without the

17

interference of the other; and, three, draws authorities

18

to punish the offender ­­ and this is the one that

19

you've been arguing ­­ from a distinct source of power

20

from the other sovereign.

21

MR. LANDAU:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
And ­­ and you keep

23

saying it's the Constitution.

24

It sounds a ­­ a bit histrionic to me.

something else.

It's the "We the People."

And I ­­

and I ­­

3
4

It is, Your Honor.

MR. LANDAU:

If ­­ if could just say ­­ make

two quick points in response to that.

7

First, Lanza is not the last word on this

8

because Wheeler, in the '70s, clarified what Lanza meant

9

because, for instance, the Ninth Circuit in Wheeler

10

said, well, the Indian Tribes don't fit the Lanza

11

definition because Congress has plenary authority to

12

overrule at any time.

13

your question.

14

So that goes to the first part of

To the second part of your question, it is

15

Congress acting in tandem with the people of Puerto Rico

16

that's critical.

17

the people of Puerto Rico that could unilaterally and

18

without reference to Congress just say, guess what?

19

are the source of authority of our own laws.

20

that would be the end of the story.

21

In other words, it is certainly not

That's not the case with Puerto Rico.

like to underscore, because I think it's critical here,

is this arrangement was not something that Puerto Rico

that I'd like to make, Your Honor, is that you have to

look at ­­ Congress has plenary authority over the

is that Congress is not the prisoner of its plenary

MR. LANDAU:

The ­­ Congress can recognize

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. LANDAU:

That's correct.

And that is

exactly ­­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that would ­­

I ­­ it would seem to me, then, that the authority to do

In the more recent cases since the

out of the blue, Your Honor.

But Bartkus didn't come
Bartkus has antecedents.

Lanza was the first case in 1922 when

20

prohibition is what really suddenly had federal criminal

21

laws that were quite widespread throughout the country.

22

And Lanza is, I think, the first case you can

23

characterize as a square holding of this case on the

24

dual sovereignty doctrine.

25

It continued to be a somewhat controversial

doctrine up until the 1950s, and then it's been, I

think, settled since then.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Landau, I'm not sure

you answered my question about why territorial

those ­­ the other ones are Home Rule legislatures.

So Congress ­­ and a D.C.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You

If you say that the issue

20

is the source of the law in question, it seems to me

21

that the territorial legislature is as much the source

22

of a law as is the legislature of Puerto Rico.

23

MR. LANDAU:

The question, Your Honor, is

24

the ultimate source of authority for the law.

25

you have a Home Rule jurisdiction ­­ again, this is ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

So when

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27
1

I'm not saying that this is what this Court has held,

2

that when you have a Home Rule jurisdiction ­­ this is

the Waller case, for instance, where it's a

4

municipality, was clearly ­­ the city council was the

5

source of the law.

6

7

But the ultimate source of the law

The critical point here is that the

8

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the legislative assembly of

9

Puerto Rico ­­ this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's

10

point and Justice Kagan's point ­­ is not exercising

11

power delegated by Congress ­­

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I see your ­­ I see your

13

time is getting up.

14

you answered Justice Scalia's question, well, yes, it

15

is ­­ it is true that local legislature is the source of

16

the law, and there is Double Jeopardy there too.

17

It seemed to me that in a way, if

MR. LANDAU:

Yes.

Well, you ­­ again, that would

18

be another way of looking at the ­­ at the issue.

19

that, frankly, was the historical way of looking at it.

20

If you go back to the 1850s cases, they said

21

territories, which at that time were creatures of

22

Congress, that was considered to be a separate sovereign

23

for Double Jeopardy.

24

But in the 20th century, particularly in Wheeler and the

25

more recent cases, the Court has said the question is

That's the historical antecedent.

the ultimate source of authority.

2

The ultimate source of authority for the

laws of Puerto Rico, unlike the ultimate source of

authority for the laws of the Virgin Islands, is the

as if Congress has given Puerto Rico as much authority

Where does it say that in

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

With some purposes.

But

the ­­ the issue here, as I see it ­­ which maybe will

10

take a second ­­ is there are four cases that say we

11

don't have to reach these grand questions.

12

to do is decide what the source of power is.

13

All we have

Now their argument is that even if you go

14

back to the Foraker Act, which indeed did have the

15

people of Puerto Rico making laws, and if you then add

16

the Resolution 600 which delegated the authority to make

17

the Constitution, the Constitution itself which speaks

18

of "We the People" of Puerto Rico making a law, the fact

19

that later Congress and the President said Puerto Rico

20

has a Republican form of government, the fact that

21

subsequent to that we went to the United Nations and had

22

them withdraw the requirement to report on a colony

23

because Puerto Rico is not a colony ­­ ­ and you know

24

the words as well as I, and they sure sound like

25

"sovereign."

I don't see, when you put all those things

together, if you're looking at the facts of what the law

of Puerto Rico is in the area, it sounds to me like it's

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So why don't you

Your Honor, those five

things established ­­

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Take your time.

I think those features of

23

Puerto Rico and others established that Puerto Rico has

24

undoubtedly achieved a significant degree of autonomy,

25

but those characteristics are not the characteristics

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

33

that matter for sovereignty purposes or for Double

2

Jeopardy purposes.

3

of power, and here the ultimate source of power is

4

Congress, which delegated the authority to enact the

5

Puerto Rican Constitution.

The question is the ultimate source

6

And I'd also point out that if one

7

looks at the characteristics of sovereignty as defined

8

in the Constitution and this Court's cases, Puerto Rico

9

doesn't have them.

10

For instance, in the Alden cases, this Court

11

explained one of the reasons we call States sovereign is

12

that one cannot frame their generally ­­ general police

13

power as the delegation of Federal power because the

14

Federal government doesn't have a general police power

15

in the States, so there's nothing to delegate.

though there are defense agreements with the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Unikowsky, it sure seems

13

as though in the early 1950s, Congress with respect to

14

Puerto Rico, said we want to give it some sovereign

15

authority.

16

Home Rule authority, basically everything, and we also

17

have some idea in our heads that Puerto Rico ought to be

18

a sovereign with all the things sovereigns have like a

19

Constitution and a "We the People" clause.

20

We want to give it an enormous amount of

And ­­ and why isn't that something ­­

21

it's ­­ it's an unusual idea, to be sure, a ­­ a

22

sovereign territory.

23

to do exactly that.

24
25

But Congress seems to have wanted

MR. UNIKOWSKY:
your premise.

Well, I'd first push back on

I don't think that's what Congress wanted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

37
1

to do.

2

history, and the ­­ the events, the historical record,

3

show that Congress wanted to delegate autonomy, which is

4

different from creating a sovereign.

5

I think that the history, the legislative

So first I'd ­­ I'd turn to the issue of

6

Section 20 in which Congress just unceremoniously

7

stripped a portion of the Puerto Rican Constitution and

8

permanently barred Puerto Ricans from enacting ­­

9

reenacting it.

10
11

That is not consistent with what I think

we ordinarily consider a sovereign.
And I'd also point to the legislative

12

history and record.

13

Secretary of the Interior, from The Resident

14

Commissioner of Puerto Rico, from the Governor of

15

Puerto Rico, in the House report, in the Senate report.

16

All of that seemed to contemplate that the political

17

status of Puerto Rico wouldn't change and this was just

18

a delegation.

19

I mean, there's testimony from the

I mean, there was actually a hearing we

20

quote on page 30 of our brief where the chairman of the

21

relevant Senate committee basically tells everybody

22

that, in fact, Congress's powers over Puerto Rico

23

wouldn't be altered at all; that ultimately this was a

24

delegation of power that one ­­ that was revoked and

25

wouldn't change Congress's ultimate power over

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

38

Puerto Rico.

2

So I actually think it's Petitioner's

3

position that really is fundamentally inconsistent with

4

the historical record as it existed at the time.

5

We don't dispute that there's ­­ this is

6

historic legislation.

7

brief characterizes the 1950 to '52 legislation as,

8

quote, "path marking."

9

it was path marking.

I mean, it's true.

Petitioner's

And we actually agree with that,
It was historic legislation that

10

delegated a significant amount of power to the people of

11

Puerto Rico, and it was very historically important, and

12

remains important today.

13

But there is a difference, a meaningful

14

constitutional difference between the delegation of

15

power and the conferral of sovereignty.

territories.

Let's

10

But have there been any commentaries that

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I don't think

I will acknowledge that

11

there has been some larger articles suggesting that this

12

whole line of cases is wrong and the Court should look

13

to something else, to autonomy.

14

Court's cases, going back a century, haven't followed

15

that approach at all.

16

But certainly this

And I actually think the municipality

17

example is a very good one for us because cities

18

regularly enact Home Rule charters through a very

19

similar type of Democratic process that Petitioner

20

describes for Puerto Rico.

21

The fundamental principle of Petitioner's

position here is that the enactment of a ­­ of a charter

23

of local self­government setting forth the parameters

for local self­government in and of itself leads to

sovereignty.

not.

Congress's exercise of its powers was fully consistent

We think that the Constitution prohibits that, and

with that constitutional requirement.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

why can't it have other arrangements with Puerto Rico

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

9

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

11
12

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

I think to respond to some of the questions

14

that have come up, I'd like to go back and address what

15

the Court has said this test is, for dual sovereignty in

16

the Double Jeopardy context, and why it's been using

17

that test.

18

And the test that the Court has consistently

19

used for the past 100 years is by looking to the

20

ultimate source of the authority, the laws for

21

prosecuting and the authority to prosecute.

22

reason that the Court has said that it's looked to that

23

ultimate source is because the dual sovereignty doctrine

24

rests on the basic structure of our Federal system.

25

That's what the Court said in Wheeler.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

And the Court

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45
1

has been very careful to guard who is a sovereign under

2

the Constitution and who is not, because, after all,

3

we're talking about a weighty power here, which is the

4

ability of two sovereigns to prosecute a person for an

5

offense with the same elements.

6

So if you trace the history of what this

7

Court has done, it started with Lanza and Grafton.

8

Lanza was a case about the Federal government as opposed

9

to the States.

And the Court said should they have this

10

power to dual prosecute?

11

Constitution, and the unique structure that was put in

12

place:

13

are in a circumstance where both the States and the

14

Federal government have this sovereign power.

15

should both be able to prosecute.

16

Well, we look to the

The splitting the atom of sovereignty.

And we

They

But then the case ­­ the Court turned to

17

cases about the territories, which was the Shell case

18

about Puerto Rico, but then also the Grafton case about

19

the Philippines, and it said, no, the territories derive

20

their ultimate power from Congress.

21

virtue of the Territory Clause.

22

That's true by

Now, one thing that the Court has considered

23

in the course of those cases as they've evolved, I

24

think, is the suggestion that Justice Kennedy made,

25

which is maybe we should focus on something else like

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

autonomy and the ability to prosecute, and what it looks

2

like practically, or on the ground.

3

And the Court has consistently rejected a

4

test along those lines, and I think that we have three

5

data points for that.

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

They haven't

issued that.
In all of those cases, Grafton and all of
the ones pre­1952, the Court pointed to the fact that,

10

when these islands pass laws, they could be vetoed by

11

Congress or ­­ or were ­­ that was the Organic Act.

12

In all of these places, Congress was

13

appointing their legislature, in part, or they were

14

appointing colonial governors.

15

each one of them, very carefully, what the issues of

16

control that remained, that didn't make them sovereign

17

in any way, that made them classic territories.

18
19
20

And we went through, in

So it's not that we didn't ­­ we eschewed
looking at that.
MS. SAHARSKY:

I don't think that's right.

21

And I'd like to just look at the specific example of

22

Puerto Rico that the Court considered in the Shell case.

23

As you say, by that point, Puerto Rico ­­ or

24

as you suggested, there had already been significant

25

self­government in Puerto Rico.

There were two houses

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

of the legislature elected.

2

this question about whether there could be both Puerto

3

Rico antitrust defenses and Federal antitrust defenses,

4

went through the situation in Puerto Rico and said there

5

is significant self­government in here now.

6

Puerto Rico as having an autonomy similar to that of the

7

States ­­ that's in 1937 ­­ and said that Congress had

8

given it a sweeping grant of legislative authority.

9

And the Court, when asking

It defined

But the Court nonetheless said that under

10

our constitutional system, as a territory of the United

11

States subject to Congress's authority, that Puerto Rico

12

was not a separate sovereign.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you forget that

Congress could veto those laws.

15

MR. SAHARSKY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

could veto Puerto Rico's laws.

18

right.

19

MR. SAHARSKY:

It ­­
Before 1952, Congress

I don't think that that's

20

21

extent the Petitioner suggests it, it's just not

consistent with the Territory Clause of the

I don't think that that's right, and to the

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, now, this is ­­
­­ gives plenary power to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

Congress.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is ­­ it's very

interesting what you're saying.

4

Remember, though, one of the provisions of

5

the Puerto Rico Constitution, which Congress approved

6

and said it was a Republican form of government, is that

7

criminal actions shall be conducted in the name and by

8

the authority of the people of Puerto Rico.

9

Now, that sounds like a delegation of

10

authority as to source, to go back to the Spanish system

11

if they want.

12

Now, if I take your view, then I guess you

13

have to say ­­ and it has considerable implication ­­

14

that that doesn't matter because Congress can take back

15

what they gave.

16

Now, is that the position of the government

17

or the executive branch?

18

implication.

Because that has tremendous

19

MR. SAHARSKY:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Because obviously, there is

21

an argument as to whether what Congress and the

22

President gave in Resolution 600, followed by the

23

Constitution, followed by what happened at the UN, under

24

the authority ­­ and looking to Felix Frankfurter for

25

guidance, who said that the Constitution provides us

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

with many forms of possible relationship.

2

his view was.

3

That's what

And now, is the position of the executive

4

branch ­­ I mean, you want to take a position on this?

5

That ­­ that ­­ that Congress, if it wishes, can take

6

all of that back and Puerto Rico has no more

7

independence than ­­ in principle, than any of the other

8

places that were territories?

9
10

Now, that's ­­ that's a big question.

But

do ­­ do you ­­ do you see it's an important question?

11

And I want to know if the government's

12

position rests upon it, because that's ­­ that's an

13

important statement for the executive, in my opinion.

14
15

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, two ­­ two responses to

that question.

16

The first, I think, is the first part of

17

your question, this statement in the Puerto Rico

18

Constitution that the authority to prosecute comes from

19

the people of Puerto Rico and that it's in the name of

20

the people of Puerto Rico.

21

That was in the 1900 Organic Act; that was true in 1917.

22

Puerto Rico is not claiming that it was a sovereign

23

then.

24
25

That's been true since 1900.

So I ­­ I would not rely on that.
But the second and, obviously, more weighty

question you raised is the question of could ­­ could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50
1

Congress revise the arrangements it has with Puerto

2

Rico?

3

follows from the structure of the Constitution and its

4

history.

5

And we think the answer is yes, and that that

I want to explain why that's why, but first,

6

I think it's very important for us to say that

7

Congress's position towards Puerto Rico, starting in

8

1900 through 1917 with the elected legislature ­­

9

elected legislators; 1947, the elected governor; and

10

then this act in 1950, has been one of increasing

11

self­government, recognizing the benefits of that to the

12

people of Puerto Rico.

13

the enactment of the Constitution.

14

a good thing.

15

Congress would revisit that.

16

benefits for the people of Puerto Rico and the United

17

States.

18

That's why Congress authorized
We think that that's

We have no reason to believe that
And we think it's had many

But asking the constitutional question,

19

which is what the Court has asked in its double jeopardy

20

cases, about whether Congress could revise the

21

arrangement with Puerto Rico, the answer is yes.

22

think that that follows from its status as a United

23

States territory because of two parts of the Territory

24

Clause.

25

And we

The first is that territories belong to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

51
1

United States, meaning that they are under the

2

sovereignty of the United States.

3
4

And then second, that Congress is the one
who makes the rules.

5

And if I could just make one more point,

6

which is historically, the fact that Congress was ­­

7

that the United States was the sovereign and the only

8

sovereign in the territories was very important at the

9

time that the Constitution was put together.

10

You may recall that the United States had

11

land there through the Northwest Ordinance, but it was

12

trying to figure out what to do with, and there were

13

questions with the States, what would happen.

14

that this provision needed to be added to the

15

Constitution to make clear that Congress was the one who

16

was going to make rules for the territories, and that it

17

would be under the sovereignty of the United States.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. SAHARSKY:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

But there are some

things ­­

20

22

And so

­­ and in this ­­
Let's go back to the

insular cases right there.
There are different kinds of territories.

24

It's because of that that Frankfurter says that the

25

Constitution has left the field of invention open.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

decisions in the insular cases mean this, if they mean

2

anything:

3

hamper the responsibility of Congress in working out

arrangements.

5

That there's nothing in the Constitution to

Now, if that's so, why couldn't Congress

7

authority to Puerto Rico to work out its own criminal

8

code subject to the constraints of the Bill of Rights,

9

et cetera?

10

right.

11

couldn't?

12

Why couldn't it?

I mean, if Frankfurter is

Or do you take the opposite position, that it

MS. SAHARSKY:

The insular cases were

13

talking about something different and narrower, which is

14

whether all the protections of the Bill of Rights apply

15

to the territories by their own force.

16

the broader question that you answered, or asked, we

17

think that it's inconsistent with the grant of authority

18

to Congress in the Constitution for a territory to be a

19

territory but no longer be sovereign, because the

20

Territory Clause defines territories of the United

21

States as subject to the authority of the United States.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But to answer

Do you think it's not

23

possible, Ms. Saharsky ­­ I mean, putting aside whether

24

Congress has done it here, but you think it's simply not

25

possible for Congress to confer sovereignty in the sense

9
10

be fundamentally inconsistent with the constitutional

11

design.

12

part of my historical answer, because I think it's very

13

important, is:

14

Constitution, it was coupled with the New States Clause,

15

and it was understood that the options for sovereignty

16

were statehood.

17

territory, that the territory was controlled by the

18

United States, and I think it would have been very

19

surprising to the States in the constitutional

20

conventions to think that when States were defined as

21

such important things in the Constitution, sharing the

22

sovereignty with the United States, that Congress could

23

somehow create a sovereign territory.

think that's correct.

and whether they are crimes in Puerto Rico, as opposed

11

to somewhere else.

12

yes, I think that's what Congress could do.

13

don't think that Congress could do is change the meaning

14

of the Fifth Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause,

15

because that's something for this Court.

16

So if that's what you're suggesting,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What we

No ­­ well, but ­­ no,

17

certainly Congress cannot ­­ cannot deny double jeopardy

18

effect to something that would be double jeopardy, but

19

I'm talking about a statute that says, even though it

20

might have double jeopardy effect, we say ­­ we say no.

21

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well ­­ right, and what I'm

22

saying is I think Congress' ability is to define crimes

23

and to set out what ­­ what they are and where they are,

24

but if the question is what the Fifth Amendment permits

25

and doesn't permit, we really think that's up to this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

55

Court.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's not a matter of

3

what the Fifth Amendment permits.

4

we will ­­ the Justice Department will not prosecute a

5

crime that has already been prosecuted in ­­ in Puerto

6

Rico.

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

Congress just says,

Right.

And the Justice

8

Department can work with Puerto Rico to decide who will

9

prosecute what crimes.

In fact, we do that as a general

10

matter so that there's usually not any overlap of the

11

kind that occurred in this case.

12

just a very different thing from suggesting that Puerto

13

Rico is a sovereign under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm being clear, because I think this case does raise a

lot of important questions, and I do think that this

Court's jurisprudence over the past 100 years has been

5

very careful about what it means to be a double jeopardy

6

sovereign ­­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you explain before

8

you sit down when and why the United States changed its

9

position on this question?

Because as I understand it,

10

in ­­ in more than one brief, took the position that

11

Puerto Rico, for double jeopardy cases, is ­­ for the

12

Double Jeopardy Clause is ­­ is treated like a State.

13

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right.

The government

14

took that position in two courts of appeals and defended

15

it in a brief in opposition to this Court, where we also

16

said the issue didn't matter.

17

have revisited this issue, given substantial attention

18

to it, both within the Department of Justice and within

19

many agencies of the Federal government, and our

20

position as set out in our brief is that it is not a

21

separate sovereign.

22

consistent with the other things we've learned and the

23

testimony that DOJ and others have given to Congress

24

about Puerto Rico's current status and options for the

25

future.

But since that time, we

And we think that that's entirely

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

57
1

The end of our brief talks about the task

2

force that the President has put in place, that has

3

issued reports three times over the past decade and a

4

half, which have said this is the constitutional status

5

Puerto Rico has now.

6

Rico want to change it, here are the options that are

7

consistent with the Constitution.

8

want, and then Congress will decide where to go from

9

there.

10

To the extent the people of Puerto

Tell us what you

So I would not want to suggest that as a

11

result of this case, that Puerto Rico's options are set

12

in stone.

13

We just think that right now Puerto Rico is a territory

14

of the United States, and as a result it's not a

15

separate sovereign under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

16

We don't think that they are set in stone.

And just to give the court the three data

17

points where the Court has said we're going to focus on

18

sovereignty under the Constitution and we're not going

19

to focus on autonomy or level of control, you have the

20

Puerto Rico v. Shell case which was where the Court said

21

Puerto Rico already has autonomy, but they're still not

22

a double jeopardy sovereign.

23

about municipalities and the State of Florida trying to

24

basically treat its municipalities as a sovereign, and

25

the Court said, no, no, no, you are not in the same

You have Waller, which is

relationship to your municipalities as the States are to

2

the Federal government; the municipalities are more like

3

the territories, there's a different ultimate source of

4

authority.

5

Indian tribes, said even though Congress has the ability

6

to legislate for the tribes, they still have this

7

inherent source of authority that predated the

8

Constitution and was recognized in the Constitution.

And then the Court, with respect to the

9

So for the Court to turn away from that, we

10

think, would really upend that precedent, and not for a

11

good reason, because ­­ I think I'd like to conclude, if

12

I can, where I started, which is:

13

sovereignty power, is a weighty power the Court has

14

reserved for those entities that have the ultimate power

15

under our Constitution, defined in our Constitution.

16

And for that reason, Puerto Rico, despite its

17

significant self­government, is not a sovereign under

18

the Constitution.

This power, this dual

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. LANDAU:

24

If I could very briefly just say that

there's two real questions here, as the questioning has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

59

brought out.

2

B, if so, is that constitutional?

3

First, what happened in 1950 to '52?

And

There's no question, if you look at the

4

documents of 1950 to '52, that Congress required Puerto

5

Rico to have a Republican form of government, which is a

6

government by the people, of the people.

not just another organic act.

13

happened.

14

Okay.

And Congress

So that goes to the what

Then you go to the real meat of the case,

15

which is the constitutional argument.

16

that the Respondents and the United States government in

17

this case are using the Territorial Clause as a

18

restriction on power, a limitation on power of

19

government.

20

Breyer was saying:

23

can come up with inventive solutions which are broader

24

than the only menu that they give, which is a colony

This is the genius of our system, that it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Landau, would you

explain what "estado libre asociado" means in Spanish?

8
9

Where do they get this view

MR. LANDAU:

It means "free associated

state," literally, and again, I think ­­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. LANDAU:

Literally.

­­ it has the concept of free

12

and it has the concept of associated, and state, in

13

estado.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you know why they

15

didn't use that phrase in the compact with the United

16

States?

17

MR. LANDAU:

I think they thought that ­­

18

that Commonwealth was the more natural English word.

19

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I believe, because I've

21

seen the Act, that they didn't because States have a

22

different meaning in the United States.

23

MR. LANDAU:

And again, we are certainly not

24

saying that we are a State.

Again, that was the whole

25

genius of the Commonwealth.

It allows flexibility by

Congress to come up with these kind of creative

2

solutions.

So ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

at double jeopardy, we're looking at something

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. LANDAU:

Just to finish that one point,

18

Your Honor, Grafton ­­ it was called Grafton v.

19

United States because the Phillipine prosecution was

20

brought in the name of the United States.

21

Shell is exactly the same thing.

The Shell

22

case said that was pursuant to an Organic Act, but

23

things changed in the 50s fundamentally.

24
25

I'm not just saying this.

This court

recognized in the whole series of decisions in the '70s

that there was a fundamental transformation and that

Puerto Rico represents a very unique constitutional

experiment in our history, about how we have an

to the people of ­­ of the ­­ of the government.
