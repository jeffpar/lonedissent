Mr. Landau.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHRISTOPHER LANDAU
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case presents the question whether

13

Congress has stripped Puerto Rico of access to any legal

14

mechanism to restructure the debts of its public

15

utilities which provide essential services to its

16

citizens, like electricity and water.

17

Respondents contend that Congress denied

18

Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 altogether, but left

19

Puerto Rico subject to Chapter 9's preemption provision.

20

That anomalous result can't be squared with the

21

statute's text and structure.

22

Congress, in 1984, defined the word "State"

23

in the Bankruptcy Code generally to include Puerto Rico,

24

except for the purposes of determining who may be a

25

debtor under Chapter 9.

But that's just another way of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

saying that Puerto Rico's outside the scope of

2

Chapter 9.

3

is to authorize its municipalities to be debtors.

4

A State's only role in the Chapter 9 regime

Indeed, Chapter 9 can't apply to Puerto Rico

5

in light of the 1984 amendment.

6

categorically precludes Puerto Rico from passing through

7

the gateway into Chapter 9, which is located in

8

Chapter 1 in Section 109(c)(2).

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That amendment

Mr. Landau, that's true.

10

Don't you run up against, with respect to the Puerto

11

Rico ­­ Puerto Rico's legislation, the Contract Clause,

12

the ­­ the bar against impairing contracts; that Puerto

13

Rico can't impair the lenders' contracts?

14

So apart from ­­ so if there's ­­ if we're

15

dealing only with the Puerto Rico legislation, doesn't

16

that, in ­­ in requiring nonconsenting lenders to give

17

up or have their claims reduced, Puerto Rico is

18

violating the Contract Clause?

19

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, the Respondents

20

here have certainly brought Contract Clause claims.

21

if this Court decides the preemption issue in our favor,

22

then they would certainly be allowed to litigate those

23

contract claims issues on appeal ­­ excuse me ­­ on

24

remand.

25

The ­­ this Court has never addressed the

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

question whether the Contract Clause applies to Puerto

2

Rico, which, as this Court is aware, is in a somewhat

3

unique position in our Federal structure.

4

said, the First Circuit has traditionally assumed that

5

the ­­ without deciding that the Contract Clause applies

6

to Puerto Rico.

That being

And again, that is an issue for remand.

7

The question presently before this Court is

8

the antecedent question on which the courts below ruled

9

against us, which is to say that the ­­ Congress's

10

exclusion of Puerto Rico from Chapter 9 nonetheless left

11

them subject to Chapter 9's preemption provision.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why would Congress

13

preclude Puerto Rico from Chapter 9?

14

what ­­ what is the background of this provision?

15

MR. LANDAU:

In other words,

Sure, Your Honor.

It is a

16

black box ­­ to answer your question directly, there is

17

no legislative history directly on point either way.

18

either side here is going to be limited to speculation

19

on that score.

20

So

The one thing that we do know for sure is

21

that the mere exclusion of an entity from Chapter 9 is

22

not typically deemed to be a representation of intent by

23

Congress to preclude a State law.

24
25

And to answer your question more directly ­­
again, I am admitting this is speculation just as their

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

position is speculation ­­ one thing that Congress could

2

have been wanting to do is to put Puerto Rico and D.C.

3

in the same boat for Chapter 9 purposes as Guam and the

4

Virgin Islands, the other Territories that are not even

5

within the definition of "State" in the Bankruptcy Code

6

in the first place.

7

unusual things happened in ­­ when this provision was

8

added.

9

In other words, two somewhat

And again, to go back to your question, I

10

think, Mr. Chief Justice, this came about after 1978

11

when the definition of "State" that had been in the

12

Bankruptcy Code going all the way back to 1898 fell out

13

of the Code.

14

include Territories and possessions.

15

That definition broadly defined "State" to

In 1978, there was an overhaul of the

16

Bankruptcy Code, and there was no definition of "State."

17

I think Congress recognized pretty quickly, as early as

18

1979.

19

Bankruptcy Code.

20

that was proposed by Senator DeConcini in 1979 went back

21

to the old definition.

22

States are included" and had no exclusion.

23
24
25

There were amendments to fix that omission of the
And the initial ­­ the initial fix

It says, "All Territories and
Okay, then.

In 1981, though, a ­­ a new definition
was ­­ that didn't go anywhere.
In 1981, Senators Dole, Heflin, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

DeConcini proposed a definition of "State" that defined

2

"States" to include Puerto Rico and D.C. only, but then

3

to exclude them from Chapter 9.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The exclusion ­­
Is there any compact

5

with those other Territories that precludes them from

6

using their Territorial power to reorganize their debts?

7

MR. LANDAU:

There is not, Your Honor.

So

8

in other words, precisely because Guam, let's say, or

9

the Virgin Islands, by, I think, pretty basic principles

10

of exclusio unius, when Congress, which had long defined

11

"States" to include all Territories and possessions,

12

suddenly in this definition, 1984, says "State" means ­­

13

includes Puerto Rico and D.C., I think there's really no

14

way to understand that other than to say that "State"

15

doesn't include Guam and the Virgin Islands.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know that Guam and the

17

Virgin Islands have Federal courts.

18

MR. LANDAU:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
And they have Federal

20

judges.

21

Is it an open question of whether they are subject to

22

the Contract Clause as well?

23

limitation, I should say?

24
25

Are they subject to constitutional provisions?

To the contract provision

MR. LANDAU: I think that, yes, Your Honor,
it is.

In other words, I ­­ this Court has never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

9
1

answered that question, as to whether or not they fall

2

more on the Federal government­like side of that, where

3

there's no contract laws with respect to the Federal

4

government, or on the State­like side of that line,

5

where there is a conflict ­­

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's the open

issue that ­­

8

MR. LANDAU:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, that is ­­
­­ has to go on remand.

10

MR. LANDAU:

11

So again, going back, in a sense, to the

­­ an open issue.

Yes.

12

Chief Justice's question, which I think is really the

13

question that everyone asks when they pick up this case:

14

Why would Congress have done that?

15

one answer that's as plausible as any other that we've

16

been able to come up with is that Puerto Rico and D.C.,

17

at least, even though they are included in the

18

definition of "State," at least for Chapter 9 purposes

19

are in the same boat as the other Territories, which

20

don't ­­ which don't fall within the scope of Chapter 9

21

and thus don't have to ­­ aren't subject to the

22

Chapter 9 preemption provision.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And again, I think

Mr. Landau, could I ask you

24

to focus on the text here a little bit?

25

gateway theory of yours, I'm not sure it matches up with

Alderson Reporting Company

Because this

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

the text very well.

2

provision which said something like, Puerto Rico is a

3

State for all purposes except Chapter 9, or except for

4

any provision in Chapter 9, or something like that.

5

Chapter 9 ­­ but this provision, 101(52), is written

6

much more specifically.

7

of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.

8

it's not any provision in Chapter 9; it's just for the

9

purpose of defining who may be a debtor.

10

I mean, you could have a gateway

But

It says except for the purpose
So

MR. LANDAU: That is an absolutely critical

11

point, Your Honor, and that goes to an interesting point

12

of the structure of the Code.

13

for the various substantive provisions of the Code, be

14

it Chapter 9, Chapter 11, Chapter 7, are not located in

15

those substantive chapters.

16

Chapter 1.

17

said Puerto Rico is not a State for purposes of

18

Chapter 9, that would actually not solve the problem at

19

issue here, because the authorization, the gateway

20

provision into Chapter 9, is not in Chapter 9.

21

Chapter 1.

22

The eligibility criteria

They are located up in

So in other words, if Congress were to have

It's in

It's this somewhat unusual structure of the

23

statute that I ­­ I really think we can't emphasize

24

strongly enough that ­­ that to say that Puerto Rico is

25

outside of Chapter 9 wouldn't have stopped Puerto Rico

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

from authorizing its municipalities under Chapter 1 to

2

get into the Chapter 9 regime, and then they're off to

3

the races under Chapter 9, because then all they have to

4

do ­­ all the Chapter 9 ­­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Landau, I'm not sure

6

I understand that argument, so you're going to have to

7

back up a minute.

8
9

MR. LANDAU:

Okay.

I'm sorry.

Yeah,

because it really is an important argument.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's, I think, critical

11

to your point, which is, Justice Kagan asked a direct

12

question:

13

directly, under 101, the term "State" includes the

14

District of Columbia and Puerto Rico except for

15

Chapter 9?

Why couldn't Congress have said much more

16

MR. LANDAU:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because ­­
If Puerto Rico is not a

18

State for Chapter 9, then it couldn't have authorized

19

its municipality to file under 109.

20

reached the same end, but more clearly saying that

21

Puerto Rico is not a State.

22

MR. LANDAU:

It would have

That 109 provision that Your

23

Honor just referenced is not located in Chapter 9.

24

located in Chapter 1.

25

for Chapter 9," it actually would not have reached that

It's

So for Congress to say "except

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

109 provision.

2

The way to close the gateway was to say

3

Puerto Rico is not a State for purposes of authorizing

4

its municipalities to be debtors under Chapter 9.

5

closes the door, which is not located in Chapter 9.

6

Once you close that door, then you don't reach ­­

7

chapter ­­ the provisions of Chapter 9 on which they

8

rely and base their entire case don't come into play,

9

because their whole argument is based on

10

That

subsection 9031.

11

9031 is a proviso to 903.

12

and these now are within Chapter 9, as opposed to

13

109(c)(2), the gateway provision, which is not in

14

Chapter 9.

15

Section 903, it says, "This chapter" ­­ i.e.,

16

Chapter 9 ­­ "shall not limit or impair the power of a

17

State."

18

If you look ­­

If you look at Chapter 1 ­­ excuse me ­­

If a State ­­ or if a jurisdiction like

19

Puerto Rico is categorically barred by Congress from

20

authorizing its municipalities to enter into Chapter 9,

21

then that reservation of power makes no sense.

22

has no conceivable applicability to Puerto Rico.

23

therefore, the 101 ­­ 9031 proviso, which refers back to

24

"such municipality" in 903, doesn't work either.

25

It ­­ it
And so

In essence, Your Honor, Respondents are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

asking you to look at that proviso in 9031 in isolation,

2

as opposed to understanding how there is a decision tree

3

here.

4

sends you to 109(c)(2), which is in Chapter 1, and then

5

that's the gateway provision.

6

Rico, we know, is not a State for purposes of

7

authorizing its municipalities to enter into Chapter 9.

8
9

Basically, the statutory definition in 101(52)

And that says that Puerto

Once you understand that that gateway is
categorically closed to Puerto Rico, unlike any of the

10

States of the union, then 903, which is the next step in

11

the decision tree, makes no sense as ­­ as it

12

purportedly applied to Puerto Rico, because what 903

13

says is, "This chapter shall not limit or impair the

14

power of a State to control its municipalities."

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But then it has two other

clauses which are the key clauses.

17

MR. LANDAU:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And the trouble that I have

19

is where it says ­­ the same problem that Justice Kagan

20

raised.

21

importing a vegetable that isn't a fish, and we can't

22

read "vegetable" as "fish."

23

what I'm having is the problem of the language.

I mean, you have a statute that prohibits

24

MR. LANDAU:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, it just isn't.

No ­­ but, Your Honor ­­
Let ­­ let me show you.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

The term "State," just as she said it, includes the

2

District of ­­ of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

3

MR. LANDAU:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Where do we find that?

5

the first part of Title 11, which has to do with

6

bankruptcy.

7

whole Bankruptcy Code.

8

"State," that includes Puerto Rico.

9

In

So what it seems to be doing is it's the
It's 11.

So when I see the word

And then it says, "except for the purpose of

10

defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9."

11

back, I look at it, and it says ­­ one of the things, it

12

says, well, a State law prescribing a method of

13

composition of indebtedness.

14

purpose of defining who is a debtor under ­­ under

15

Chapter 9.

16

So I go

That is not for the

So what am I supposed to do about that?
MR. LANDAU:

Again, Your Honor, if you look

17

at this as the decision tree, you're already looking

18

down here at the third ­­ at the third ­­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

What the first part of the

20

tree says is, State, nothing we say really stops you

21

from controlling your municipality, except in one

22

important respect.

23

MR. LANDAU:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.
And the important respect

is that you cannot have your own bankruptcy law.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1
2

MR. LANDAU:

But logically, that 9031 part

that you were referring to ­­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. LANDAU:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

tree.

Yeah.

­­ doesn't make any sense.
But I read it as a decision

What am I supposed to say?

7

MR. LANDAU:

Okay.

So the decision tree

8

starts, as you ­­ as you recognize, with 101(52), the

9

definitions.

It says Puerto Rico is not a State for

10

purposes of determining who may be a debtor under

11

Chapter 9.

12

That provision, 109(c)(2), says that an entity must ­­

13

in order to get into Chapter 9, you must have that

14

authorization from a State.

15

That sends us to Chapter 1, to 109(c)(2).

So we know that Puerto Rico is categorically

16

precluded from authorizing its municipalities to enter

17

into Chapter 9.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. LANDAU:

20

I know that.

Okay.

So that ­­ that's the

second step in the tree.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. LANDAU:

They can't be a debtor.

Okay.

And so then we get to

23

the third step, which I think is exactly what Your Honor

24

is asking.

25

this chapter, i.e., Chapter 9, does not limit or impair

The third step in that decision tree says

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

the power of a State to control.

2

there, I think, Your Honor, is what you put your finger

3

on, which is to say:

4

to think that in this provision, when Congress is

5

talking about "State," this chapter doesn't limit the

6

part of the State, that Congress would have intended

7

that to apply to a jurisdiction that Congress has not ­­

8

has categorically precluded from even authorizing its

9

municipalities.

So the question right

Does that make any sense at all,

10

That's the key question, in other words.

11

And, Your Honor, it's a very big deal to assume that

12

Congress categorically precluded Puerto Rico from access

13

to anything.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So ­­ so then where ­­

15

where ­­ where in the Code, except for this provision ­­

16

are there dozens of places?

17

the word "State" is used outside of Chapter 9's debtor

18

provisions where then it makes sense to read Puerto Rico

19

into it?

20

MR. LANDAU:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. LANDAU:

23

A thousand? ­­ where

There's about 40.
About 40?

And in fact, if you look at the

legislation ­­

24
25

20?

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you have them in your

brief?

MR. LANDAU:

I ­­ I believe, yes, Your

Honor, they ­­ they ­­ we ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But in all those

8

provisions, debtor, creditor, State play active roles in

9

implementing the provisions of those chapters.

10

MR. LANDAU:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
So in all the other 40

12

places, the State is involved ­­

13

MR. LANDAU: Correct.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ by ­­ inherent in the

15

definition of what a debtor and what a creditoror is,

16

the State has rights and responsibilities under those

17

provisions.

18

MR. LANDAU:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
What you ­­ what I'm

20

understanding you to say is, Puerto Rico has been kicked

21

out of Chapter 9 altogether.

22

the gateway.

23
24
25

MR. LANDAU:

It doesn't even get into

Exactly, Your Honor.

And I

think ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so to read it as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

18
1

being involved as a State, the only other place that's

2

used is here.

3

MR. LANDAU:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

part of it in some way.

6

MR. LANDAU:

Correct.
In 903, you have to be

That's exactly right, Your

7

Honor.

8

categorically shut the door on Puerto Rico, that ­­ that

9

then it would mean for this to apply, Your Honor.

It's nonsensical to think that Congress having

10

Again, the only thing a State does under this entire

11

Chapter 9 regime, which is not located exclusively in

12

Chapter 9, but also in that eligibility provision up in

13

Chapter 1 in 109(c)(2), then you just ­­ the question

14

then arises ­­ and, Justice Breyer, if this actually did

15

something, this would be a different case.

16

says, again, is this chapter does not limit or impair

17

the power of a State to control.

18

But all this

When you're talking about a jurisdiction

19

like Puerto Rico that is not allowed to be authorizing

20

its municipalities, then there's nothing to be preserved

21

here.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Landau, this is

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you didn't cite

Is there a reason you didn't?
MR. LANDAU:

Well, Your Honor, I think we

11

for the proposition that you can't just look at one

13

excuse me, one isolated provision and not understand how

that fits into the context.

15

Again, I think Respondents are asking you to

16

just pick up this case, read 903(1) and say, here it is.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

All I have to do is to get

18

myself to do the following thing:

I could dress it up

19

so people couldn't understand it.

But what I would be

20

doing is saying the following:

21

it says the chapter does not limit or impair the power

22

of a State, okay, et cetera, et cetera.

23

MR. LANDAU:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

It says a State law, and

Right.
Now, all I have to say is

that word "State" right there does not include Puerto

Because Puerto ­­
My only problem with

4

writing those words is somebody is going to direct me to

5

the provision a little bit later where it says the word

6

"State" in Title 11, of which this is part, means Puerto

7

Rico.

Okay?

8

MR. LANDAU:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Well, Your Honor ­­
Now, that ­­ that's hard

for me to do because of that language.

Your Honor has always been so sensitive to the

contextual approach to ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

That may be, but I can't

say that an "airplane" means a horse.

(Laughter.)

17

MR. LANDAU:

And I totally ­­ no, but, Your

18

Honor, if ­­ if somebody is saying this doesn't apply to

19

driving, and then this one is about a ­­ a subsequent

20

provision is about a right turn on red regulation, you'd

21

say, no, but driving has been taken completely out of

22

the statute.

23

In other words, you are in a position ­­ by

24

the time you get to ­­ this is kind of a truism.

25

is basically a federal ­­ 903, when I'm saying "this,"

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

21
1

is an important federalism limitation on Chapter 9.

2

It's actually stated more descriptively than anything

3

else.

4

It says, "This chapter does not limit or

5

impair the power of a State."

6

that Congress has shut the door, there is no door for

7

Puerto Rico and no key for Puerto Rico.

8

come along and say, well, it says "State" here, then I

9

have to apply the power of State.

If we know by definition

Then to ­­ to

I think you can ­­

10

the definition of "State," but I think you have to

11

understand that when Congress has given a definition of

12

"State" that ­­ that categorically closes the door in

13

the antecedent portion of the decision tree; you don't

14

even reach this sensibly.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Landau, I ­­ I think

16

I get what you're saying now, which I didn't when I

17

started with.

18

a State, except for purposes of Chapter 9, because, in

19

fact, there's something that's outside of Chapter 9 that

20

determines who gets into Chapter 9.

21

You're saying they couldn't just say it's

So what they did was they said it's a State,

22

except for purposes of this gateway, and then they

23

assumed that that meant that all of Chapter 9 wouldn't

24

apply either.

25

That's your basic argument.

MR. LANDAU:

Precisely, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So ­­ but before 1984,

2

before this amendment, this 903(1) did apply to Puerto

3

Rico; wasn't that right?

4
5
6

MR. LANDAU:

Yes, Your Honor, that is

correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're saying that the

7

really super significant change, which is 903(1) applies

8

to Puerto Rico before 1984, and then doesn't apply after

9

1984 because of this definitional move that they made

here in 101(52).
What you have to admit is ­­ I'm not quite

also got the benefits of Chapter 9.

symmetry between those entities that Congress gave

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's ­­ I

mean, that's your basic policy argument, and I'm not

sure it carries much weight.

8

irrational for Congress to say, all right, this is the

9

system we're going to apply to all the States, but when

Why ­­ why would it be

10

it comes to Puerto Rico, if they want changes, we want

11

them to come to us, partly because Congress has a

different sort of relationship with Puerto Rico than it

has to all the other States?

MR. LANDAU:

MR. LANDAU:

And, frankly, it

to yours because that would be Puerto Rico in a worse

MR. LANDAU:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. McGILL

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

12
13

MR. McGILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

Everyone here agrees that in 1984, Congress

15

withdrew from Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia

16

the power to put their municipalities into Chapter 9

17

bankruptcy.

18

Petitioners' position is that by the same

19

enactment, Congress impliedly gave Puerto Rico and the

20

District a much greater power that no State has

21

possessed since 1946, the power to write its own

22

municipal laws.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, no State has

24

possessed the power to impair contract rights under the

25

Constitution.

Nothing about the Bankruptcy Code changes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

28

the application of the Contract Clause.

2

into Chapter 9 to impair contracts ­­

3

MR. McGILL:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

They have to go

Justice ­­
­­ in a meaningful way,

correct?

6

MR. McGILL:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, but Justice Sotomayor ­­
All right.

So what

8

makes you think that Congress intended to let Puerto

9

Rico and the District of Columbia have free reign in

10

whatever they wanted to do?

11

Wouldn't they be subject, in your

12

judgment ­­ I'm sure you'd be arguing they're subject to

13

the Contract ­­ Impairment Clause.

14

MR. McGILL:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. McGILL:

And they are.
Exactly.

The Contract Clause applied

17

directly to Puerto Rico by dint of the Jones Act from

18

1917.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you think Congress

20

intended to stop Puerto Rico and the District of

21

Columbia from passing emergency legislation that said

22

don't shut off the lights tonight; that ­­ that Congress

23

intended that that kind of temporary provision could

24

only be subject to Congress, who may be on recess, who

25

might be wherever it is, that it could not do that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

29
1

MR. McGILL:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor, because

2

in 1946 that was precisely the decision Congress made

3

when it decided to overrule this Court's decision in

4

Faitoute.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it decided to

6

overrule it by giving States the opportunity to go into

7

bankruptcy, and that would be a temporary state to start

8

with.

9

MR. McGILL:

So ­­ so the question is, as I

10

understand it, Justice Sotomayor, is what was Congress

11

doing in 1984?

12

from the District and from Puerto Rico the opportunity

13

to put its municipalities into Chapter 9 ­­

Was it ­­ we all know that it removed

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. McGILL:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it never gave ­­

­­ everyone agrees ­­
And it never gave the

17

Territories that.

18

that stops the lights from going out today until

19

Congress comes into effect, 'cause it can't do a

20

permanent impairment of the contract.

21

So the Territories can pass a law

MR. McGILL:

Justice Sotomayor, that's not

22

correct, I don't believe.

23

nothing turns on it, but let me explain why this

24

argument, which shows up for the first time in the

25

yellow brief, I think is wrong.

It's not presented here, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

30
1

Puerto Rico was ­­ was considered a State.

2

It itself admits it was a quote/unquote State from the

3

period of 1978 to 1984 when there was no definition of

4

"State."

5

Prior to 1978, all States, Territories, and

6

possessions of the United States were States.

7

1978, all States, Territories, and possessions continued

8

to be treated as States.

9

enacts 101(52) which says States include the District

After

And then in 1984, Congress

10

and Puerto Rico except for this one purpose, which is to

11

defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.

12

That ­­ so the question is whether ­­ you

13

know, it doesn't say Ohio, it doesn't say "State"

14

includes Ohio, but clearly it does, because everyone

15

acknowledges old definition of State has essentially

16

carried through.

17

So I don't believe it's correct.

And no

18

court I'm aware of has ever held that ­­ that the

19

district ­­ that the Virgin Islands or Guam or the

20

American Samoa are not States for purposes of ­­ of the

21

Bankruptcy Code.

22

What we have here, however, is a clear

23

textural provision that says Puerto Rico is a State, and

24

it is ­­ so is the District of Columbia, except for this

25

one purpose, which is defining who may be a debtor under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

31
1

Chapter 9.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't the definitional

3

section of the Code tell you who qualifies as a debtor,

4

who qualifies as a creditor, who can go into what

5

chapter or not?

6

It tells you if you're this kind of

7

creditor, you go into that chapter.

8

of creditor, you go ­­ I'm sorry.

9

of debtor, you go to ­­ individual goes here, business

10

goes there, this one goes here.

11
12

If you're that kind
If you're this kind

You have options.

Isn't it what he describes as a gateway that
tells you where you're a part or what you're a part of?

13

MR. McGILL:

Today that's true, but it

14

wasn't true when Chapter 9 was first enacted in 1934 and

15

1937.

16

In 1934, the gateway provision was

17

Section 83 ­­ I mean Section 81 of the '34 Act, which

18

was then known as Chapter X or Chapter 10, and it was

19

Section 83(a) again in 1937.

20

recodification of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978 that moved

21

all of the gateway requirements to Section 109.

22

one has ever contended that that was intended to be a

23

substantive change.

24
25

So it was the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And no

Oh, but it is, because

it tells you what kind of debtors can make use of what

kind of provision.

2
3

MR. McGILL:

I

mean ­­

But that was always true.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is always.

That's

what the purpose of a gateway is.

6

MR. McGILL:

But ­­ no, no, but it was true

7

when it was part of Chapter 9 ­­ old Chapter X and old

8

Chapter IX.

gateway provisions defined who may be a debtor.

It was true then that the gateway ­­ the

So if the ­­ if the

19

definitional section defines "State" to include Puerto

Rico, and you say even though it's not a part of Chapter

21

9 by definition in 109, it still remains a State for

22

purposes of this reservation of State powers?

just straight on the text.

understanding of Mr. Landau's understanding of the text,

13

and so I just want to engage you on that, which is:

14

Look, Congress couldn't have just said "except for

purposes of Chapter 9" because of this flukey thing,

16

which is that the gateway provision is outside of

Chapter 9.

provision particularly.

assumed that all of Chapter 9 would follow in its wake.

me why that's wrong.

3

MR. McGILL:

So tell

It's ­­ it starts ­­ I think

4

the fundamental fallacy of the argument is that the

5

gateway requirement somehow excludes you from the scope

6

of Chapter 9 entirely.

7

because if PREPA filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy today,

8

it's Section 921(c) of the Code, a part of Chapter 9,

9

that would provide for the dismissal of that petition.

10

Chapter 9 applies to all persons, all people under the

11

compass of Federal law.

12
13

And we know that's wrong,

So I think that that's the fundamental
fallacy.

Chapter 9 does apply.

bow; that is, what he wants us to do is to take the

18

19

wants us to read that as if there were then a

22

that can be debtors under Chapter 9.

He has some ­­ an additional string to the

Now, he

The States

23

Now, that's how he wants us to read it, and

that means that that provision does not apply to Puerto

But it isn't just that no part of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

38
1

Chapter 9 could apply to them.

2

at the first sentence of 903, is that what it says is

3

that those States that are referred to in that first

4

sentence maintain all the power to control by

5

legislation or otherwise a municipality.

6

It is that if you look

And he says, what could that apply to?

7

Those entities that are not in Chapter 9 obviously have

8

all the powers they normally had, but the ones that are

9

in Chapter 9 might not.

And so what this Section 903 is

10

addressed to are those States that are in Chapter 9,

11

because there's no need to apply that first sentence to

12

anyone else, and therefore it doesn't apply to Puerto

13

Rico, that first sentence.

14

one and two, are subparts of the first sentence, they

15

don't apply, either.

16

But since the key sentences,

I think that's the whole argument.

And it

17

isn't requiring us to really play that much ­­ you don't

one of those parts of Chapter 9 ­­ not all, but one of

portions of Chapter 9 that do apply to municipalities

MR. McGILL:

There are a few reasons, I

think.

12

legislative history that sets this forth in detail, but

13

let me suggest a few reasons why Congress might have

14

done what it did.

15

And as Mr. Landau has said, there is no

First, Congress has for a long time

that Congress ended its own restriction of Puerto Rico's

Congress has essentially told the nation

Puerto Rico already had

The District owed 1.6 billion, and

10

it was about to hit the general obligation bond market

11

for the first time in its history.

12

So the question I ­­ I ask is, how would

13

Congress, at that moment in time, actually think that

14

this was the right time to abandon a 40­year­old policy

15

of uniformity and preemption in the field of municipal

16

bankruptcy, and ­­ and for the first time since 1946,
