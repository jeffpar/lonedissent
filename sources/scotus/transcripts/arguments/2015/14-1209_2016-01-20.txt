ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW T. FINDLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. FINDLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

ANILCA was the result of a grand bargain.

11

Congress enacted ANILCA to finally resolve land

12

ownership in Alaska, a process that began with the

13

Statehood Act and continued with the Native Claims

14

Settlement Act, both statutes that granted land to the

15

State and native corporations to further economic

16

development and self­sufficiency for Alaska and its

17

people.

18
19
20

ANILCA very carefully balanced conservation
with those important goals.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. ­­ Mr.

Findley, can I

21

ask two quick clarifying questions just so I understand

22

what's at issue here?

23

Your argument applies to the navigable

24

rivers generally; is that right?

25

navigable rivers running through the federally owned

In other words, to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

land as well as to those running through the inholdings?

2

MR. FINDLEY:

If a navigable river is

3

surrounded by the outer boundaries of the park, yes,

4

that's covered by Section 103(c).

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And is there any information

6

in the record about whether your client actually was

7

running his boat on the portions which were ­­ are

8

within the federally owned parts, or instead it's the

9

inholdings?

10

Is that what you called them?

11

MR. FINDLEY:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. FINDLEY:

That is one word for it.
Yes.
He was within the shore.

14

either side of where his hovercraft was stopped was

15

Federal public land.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
Was Federal public land?
Yes, exactly.
Okay.

Thank you.

Oh, sure.
Just, again, a preliminary

question.

24

MR. FINDLEY:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Sure.
Is it conceded by all or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

is it not that this is navigable ­­ that these are

2

navigable waters?

3

MR. FINDLEY:

Yes.

And the Ninth Circuit

4

issued decision in 2001 called Alaska v. United States

5

by Judge Kleinfeld which adjudicated the Nation River

6

navigable.

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's not contested

here?

9

MR. FINDLEY:

10

No, it is not contested here.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're claiming a

11

right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic

12

lands.

13

to control navigable waters in the Federal lands area?

14

You're claiming that there's no residual right

MR. FINDLEY:

What Mr. Sturgeon is

15

arguing ­­ we've been very specific about that ­­ is

16

that the Park Service does not have authority to issue

17

its Park Management Regulations to cover State navigable

18

waters that run through these ANILCA parks.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do you do about

20

the ANILCA provision that says that boating and other

21

water activities within public lands, within Federal

22

public lands can be regulated?

23

MR. FINDLEY:

Yes.

And those apply to all

24

kinds of waters that are not navigable.

25

Federal waters and those ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Those apply to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It doesn't say navigable

And there is ­­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

both, is what I'm saying.

8

navigable waters?

9

MR. FINDLEY:

Well, it could apply to

What says it excludes

You turn back to the

10

definition of public lands in the statute, which makes

11

clear for anything to be public lands, the United States

12

must hold title.

13

And there really is no dispute.

The United

14

States does not hold title to the submerged lands or the

15

navigable waters.

16

aren't public lands.

17

So those navigable waters, they

Section 103(c) makes crystal clear they're

18

not part of the park and they are not subject to

19

regulations solely enacted to manage our claim.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I wasn't sure, but

21

I ­­ I thought maybe they were suggesting that the

22

navigational servitude and its reserved rights were ­­

23

were title.

24
25

MR. FINDLEY:

They are not title interests.

They are both nonpossessory use rights.

Alderson Reporting Company

Even the Ninth

Official

7
1

Circuit made crystal clear that the navigationable

2

servitude is not something the United States owns.

3

the Submerged Lands Act itself disavows an actual title

4

of proprietary interest pursuant to the navigational

5

servitude.

6

answer:

7

And

Reserved water rights, it had the same

They're a nonpossessory use right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it ­­ it ­­ it may well

8

be, you think, that the Federal government would have

9

authority to do this in the exercise of its navigational

10

servitude even though it doesn't have authority to do

11

it, as you assert, under the Park Service?

12

MR. FINDLEY:

Our objection is to the Park

13

Service asserting its regulation on these navigable

14

waters.

15

authority to the Park Service in 103(c).

16

Our position is Congress expressly denied this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The idea was if you weren't part of the

10

11

through after ANILCA was enacted.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you have a

13

regulation or a statute that's applicable to all United

14

States parks.

15
16

Is it applicable here?

MR. FINDLEY:

If it's a regulation that the

MR. FINDLEY:

So you

You have to look at whether

this is a regulation that was solely enacted to manage

If the Park Service ­­ this is a Park

read this code of Federal regulations and the Park

Service is saying, we want fires here on public lands;

7

That's the type

If the EPA says, look, we're concerned about

10

Clean Air Act emissions from fire smoke and we are going

11

to issue a generally applicable regulation across the

United States on when you can burn wood and when you

MR. FINDLEY:

The Ninth Circuit took a very

25

Alaska­specific regulations.

And it was a reading that

frankly, no ­­ there's evidence Congress thought this is

Under the Ninth Circuit ruling, those

So you're saying that

the U.S. can't control the navigable servitude in any

14

part of that coast.

15

MR. FINDLEY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. FINDLEY:

No.

Can.

The Park Service hasn't been

18

delegated that authority.

20

The United States can.

It was expressly denied that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so what do you take

21

the words in ­­ in 103(c) to mean, the boating

22

exception, when it says "in the jurisdiction of the

23

United States"?

"Waters in the jurisdiction"?

24

You don't think navigable waters are within

25

the jurisdiction of the United States in Federal lands?

Alderson Reporting Company

12

MR. FINDLEY:

That's within the regulation

that the Park Service promulgated nationwide, saying

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the ­­ as it

So the question, I would think, would be is

16

this portion of the river within the boundaries of the

19

boundaries of the park.

20

pursuant to ­­

It is not part of the park

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, now, you look at what

22

they say about that, and you get, when they're defining

23

the Yukon­Charley River's National Preserve, it says

24

that that national preserve ­­ which is the whole thing,

25

which includes the section of the river that we're

At least we ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

quoting from?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm quoting from

12

I'll ­­ I'll have to show you later, because I'm

13

quoting ­­

14

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're going to get into

16

numbers, and I ­­ I just thought this case is too

17

complicated to ask anything, but you've tempted me.

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

And so ­­ so you see ­­

have you got in your mind what I just quoted?

21

MR. FINDLEY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And then once you have

23

that, you have this regulation applying to this portion

24

of the river.

25

So now we look to the statute to see if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

anything there takes away what the regulations seem to

2

give.

3

an important part ­­ that supports you is the second

4

sentence.

5

that, "The regulations that apply solely to public lands

6

within such units," you see, "are the ones that don't

7

apply to the private land up in Yukon­Charley.

8
9

And the only part of the statute ­­ though it's

But as I read that second sentence, it says

But I've just read you a regulation, which,
on my reading of it, is the Hovercraft Regulation, and

10

does not apply solely to public lands within National

11

Park Service units, either in Alaska or anywhere else.

12

And therefore, the statute doesn't stop it.

13

Now, that's ­­ that's ­­ and I want to ­­ I

14

don't know if I can do this orally; I just tried to,

15

which is to put the argument against you as best I

16

could, and I want to hear the reply.

17

MR. FINDLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

18

And you know, this is ­­ and the government makes the

19

same argument in its briefing here.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. FINDLEY:

Yes.

And ­­ and this is a dispute

22

that's why ­­ it's what has brought us together here

today.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. FINDLEY:

Uh­huh.

But prior to 1996, the Park

Alderson Reporting Company

16

Service did not apply this regulation to navigable

2

waters.

3

in 36 C.F.R. 1.2(b) where they say now we're going to

4

apply this to navigable waters without regard to

5

ownership of the submerged lands.

6

Mr. Sturgeon is objecting to.

That was a change they made in 1996, and that's

And that is what

7

The whole point was 103(c) says ­­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. FINDLEY:

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Findley, I mean ­­
­­ you can't do that.
­­ whether or not that's

11

true, agencies can change their mind about things.

12

I think that the question that Justice Breyer is putting

13

to you is this question about what this provision means:

14

"Shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely

15

to public lands."

16

And

I mean, "solely" is a very purposive word,

17

you know?

18

put "solely" in a sentence when you mean "solely."

19

this does not apply solely to public lands.

20

I mean, Congress drops lots of words, but you

MR. FINDLEY:

And

Because the regulation never

21

should have been allowed to reach out to the public

22

land.

23

Regulation, as promulgated in 1983, was a regulation

24

promulgated solely to manage park land.

years, does not suddenly make the regulation ­­

5

That's

MR. FINDLEY:

Read that sentence in context

7

third sentence, and then read it in context with the

8

purpose of the statute.

9
10

The first sentence says these lands are not
part of the park.

11

The second sentence is doing its best to

12

make clear these lands won't be regulated as though they

13

were.

14

And the third sentence makes clear that if

15

the Federal government ­­ or the Park Service, excuse

16

me ­­ wants to regulate these lands, wants them to be

17

part of the park, they have to go out and acquire them.

18

There wouldn't be any purpose for that third sentence if

the Federal government ­­ or, excuse me ­­ the Park

And if you take a step back and you look at

the overall purpose of the statute ­­ and again 101(d)

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH BOTSTEIN,
AS AMICUS CURIAE FOR ALASKA,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. BOTSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
This case is about honoring Congress's

17

mandate to protect Alaska's sovereignty in the face of

18

the Park Service's rapidly­expanding interpretation of

19

its own jurisdiction under ANILCA.

20

Congress provided in ANILCA that Alaska

21

would lose over 100 million acres of land.

22

same time, Congress provided concrete protection against

23

further encroachments on the lands and waters that

24

Alaska did retain.

25

Service's attempt to redefine the Federal/State balance

But at the

This Court should reject the Park

that Congress chose.

2

We know from ANILCA that Congress intended

3

to provide unique management rules for Alaska, and there

4

are good reasons for that.

5

a trilogy of legislation that began with the Alaska

6

Statehood Act and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement

7

Act, and this piece of legislation furthered the goals

8

of those predecessors.

9

This was the continuation in

One purpose of the statute was to provide

10

adequate opportunity for the satisfaction of the

11

economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its

12

people.

13

conservation goals and the goals of completing the land

14

selections within the States.

15

National Park Service's authority in other States or in

16

other parks are not the baseline here.

17

point is the power that Congress gave to the National

18

Park Service and other Land Management agencies in

19

regulating ANILCA parks.

20

And Congress explicitly balanced that goal with

to set aside the inholdings of the State, private, and

24

in fact part of the parks.

When Congress created new park units in

Now, I understand what the Ninth Circuit to

12

have held, to be this, that the hovercraft rule is not

13

barred by the second sentence of Section 103(c) of

ANILCA, because the hovercraft rule does not apply only

is this authority one that gives the Park Service the

ability to regulate lands whether they are public or

12

And if you look at the text, it does.

And

13

as a result, this is not a regulation ­­ if you think

that waters within the parks are private lands, this is

15

not the kind of regulation that's carved out by the

to be correct.

18

Just giving meaning to the word solely, that has

And if you also look to other provisions of

19

the statute, it confirms it in two ways, if I could just

20

focuses on two of them.

21

The first is, if you look at the management

22

plan of the statute of ANILCA, it expressly contemplates

23

that the Park Service is going to be able to regulate

24

private lands under some circumstances.

25

that by saying, you need your management plan to

Alderson Reporting Company

And it does

Official

48
1

describe the activities that are occurring on private

2

lands and to describe any methods you're going to use ­­

3

the methods you're going to use to control those

4

activities, including, quote, "issuance or enforcement

5

of regulations."

6

And just the other thing I think ­­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if I'm looking at the

8

right section, I mean, I would have thought that that

9

was key to your argument, because it says in these

10

management plans what you need is a ­­ is a "description

11

of privately owned areas which are within such unit."

12

So it's clearly contemplating that there are these

13

private areas that are within the unit.

14

And then as you say, it goes on and says we

15

want in these plans some idea of what regulations are

16

going to be applying on those private lands within the

17

unit.

18

MS. KOVNER:

That's right, Your Honor.

And

19

if I could just focus on the one other part of the

20

statute that confirms that this reading is correct, that

21

the Park Service isn't being stripped of its preexisting

22

authority to regulate rivers.

23

other provisions of the statute that very clearly

24

confirm the Park Service is going to have the authority

25

to regulate rivers.

It's if you look at the

And let me just give two examples

of those.

land for parks ­­ and let me use the park here as an

provisions is the Wild and Scenic River Act provisions

deemed to be included as a portion of such unit."

MS. KOVNER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

No.
