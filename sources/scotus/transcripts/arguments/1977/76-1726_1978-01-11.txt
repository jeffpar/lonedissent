Further, ia fch-s _ language of the Act itself it- may
indicate that the Act la not intended to be exclusive, because
S@ct.i-oa 764 reveals that wi-th rospect, to ©laments of damage
recoverable under the Death on the High Seas Act, by express
provision, the incorporation of foreign law is permitted to
supplement the damages recoverable under the Act.

So that if

an. accident occurred involving a Japanese shipping company, for
instance, and ths? law of Japan permitted the recovery of nonpecuniary losses, a seasum in those circumstances, his
survivors could then augment the pecuniary losses provided
for under the Jones Act find Death on the High Seas Act by
the law of Japan.
i\ ■jBB'JXQl*:

Mr. Benjamin, let me ask another question.

Supposing you1 m right, w© rule with you, and then supposing
■&$ day sffcsr the Court decides you’re right, Congress repeals
tha Dr-i t, :,.i th* High Set:-s Act, would that affect any amge
in th«3 law?
Would there be anything left «at all of that statute
if we agree with you?
M.'?„ BENJAMIN:
Jif-i-1d.cc! £

Any need for it at all?

To illustrate further, Your Honors are aware of the
simouat. of oil fiald activity off tha coast of Louisiana.,
boats :?nd ships are constantly moving from the shoreline to
tbs high seas,

it would impose a most onerous burden upon a

litigant if h® war© entitled, or if his survivors were
entitled to re co-war nonpecuniary losses within a three-mile
limit end this litigants were not positive of where the injury
or death occurred.
Louisiana* s coast line, as Your Honors know from

stler canes involving boundaries, nu voider, islands

appear, disappear and re~appear, and it is quit® difficult to

Yes.

MR» BENJAMIN; And, as I said, the recovery for loss
of society, although not permitted under the provisions o: the
Jonas Act and Death on the High Seas Act, are permitted by
the statutes of most States, and are consistent with fee
advance of the maritime lew and its special solicitudes»
QUESTION;

HR. BENJAMIN;

question, sir.

Well, have there been any suggestions

to

Congress that: Congress amend the Death on the High Seas Act,
to keep pace with the times, as you would think?

Honor.

I don’t believe they have been, Your

In recent —
QUESTION: At least Congress hasn’t amended it?
MR. BENJAMIN:

)

I:a recent: years, it has not amended it,

no.
:i would like to conclude by reminding the Court that
both th© Dr ath on the High Seas Act and the Jones Act nest
net be

relegated,

as th® Fifth Circuit said, and .as some cf

the coniiwatators have said, to the briny deep, nor to the
scrap heap, or to the level of nonetatutory restatements.
They may remain as a basis for recovery for
pecuniary losses , and may be augmented by the remedy
enunciate d by tills Court in Moragne and Gaudet for the
recovery of nonpecuni&xy losses, with substantial uniformity
to the law and substantial jusM.ce to the litigant.
Thank you, sirs.
QUESTION:

I suppose you would say that the statute

keeps this Court from reversing itself and utterly doing away
with a causa of action for death on th® high seas?
That’s at least the function of the statute.
NR. BENJAMIN:

No, I wouldn't —» I wouldn't claim

that, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Benjamin.
Mr. Schumacher, do you have anything further?
MR. SCIIUHACIIER: Thank you, four Honor, no.

I choose

not to.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen,
