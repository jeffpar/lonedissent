P R O C E E D I N «2 S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 76-906, United Air Lines against McMann.
I think you may proceed whenever you are ready,
Mr. Aikens.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD T. AIKENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AIKENS;

Mr. Chief Justice, may ifc please the

Court;
This matter is before the Court on petition of
certiorari to the Fourth Circuit

Court of Appeals.

The case

arises under the Age Discrimination Act, and presents a vary
narrow issue—that is, whether an involuntary retirement of a
person under age 65, pursuant to a bona fid© pension plan
adopted many years before the act, is permissible without
further justification.
A stipulation in this case has been entered into as
to the facts, and they may be vary briefly stated.

The

Respondent McMann began his employment with United Airlines in
1344.

And during the course of his career he held several

positions.

He was retired at the ag® of SO in 1973 and at

that time held the position of technical specialist, aircraft
systems, which is a flight management position.
At the time respondent began his employment with
United, United had a pension plan in existence.

Membership was

4
voluntary.

Respondent did not elect to join that plan until

several years later, in 1964.

At the time he joined the plan,

his application card indicated that the normal retirement age
was 60 years.

Thereafter, he received annual reports from the

company describing the benefits he had accrued, and on the face
of each of these reports the normal retirement age was stated
as 60.
Prior to his retirement in 1973, respondent notified
the Secretary of Labor that he intended to sue on the ground
that his retirement violated the Age Discrimination Act.

The

Labor Department responded that United’s plan was a bona fide
plan and inasmuch as it had been adopted many, many years
bofor© the act, that it did not appear to be a subterfuge.
Responderit then filed his action in the Eastern District of
Virginia, the case was submitted on cross motions for summary
judgment, and summary judgment was granted in favor of United.
He appealed to the Fourth Circuit, claiming that; his
retirement violated the Discrimination Act.

United contended

that an express exception, Section 4(f)(2), expressly provided
that involuntary retirement was authorized pursuant to a bona
fid© plan th at. was not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of
the act.

United relied upon then the only appellate decision,

Brennanjr< Tuft Eroadcastfng, and said that inasmuch as its
plan h'id' pre-existed th© act by some 26 years that it therefor©

could not be a subterfuge, which was the holding in the Taft

5
case»

The Fourth Circuit reversed.

The subs tail ce of its

holding was that any involuntary retirement is presumed t© bs
a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the act.

Looking to the

legislative history of the act, the Court said that in order
to avoid the condemnation of subterfuge, the employer must
prove that the retirement related to either on economic or a
business purpose and not simply age.
In this decision the Fourth Circuit stands alone,
The Second, Third, Fifth, and Ninth are now in conflict.
Two sections of the act are pertinent to this case.
Section 4(a) provides that it shall be unlawful for an employer
to fail or to refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or
otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to
his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employ­
ment because of the individual's age.
Q

Mr. Aikens, I am curious about one fact.

Does

the record shew that everybody under this plan was discharged
at age 60 by United?
MR. ALIENS:

Yas, the record does show.

It is

revealed in a system board decision Professor Cox wrote which
indicates that the normal retirement plan is followed for
everyone at United.

The Fourth Circuit's decision recognises

the fact that United has uniformly applied the plan.
Q

No exceptions whatsoever?

MR. AIKENS:

No exceptions within United Air Lines,

6

Inc.
Q

What happens if a parson is retired under the

section and then applies for reemployment?
MR. AIKENS:

You mean if he were retired on on® day

and applied for reappointment the following day,, Your Honor?
W© do not think that it is possible under the act, realizing
that the. act has two somewhat inconsistent phrases.
Q
say to him?

What do you mean "possible"?

What would United say to th© person applying?

MR. AIKENSs
that the act

What would you

United, would have to say, Your Honor,

does not ban a retirement, program, that he has

bsen retired, ;and that th® kind of employment the act speaks
of is these persons who have not been retired and are receiving
benefits.
Q

Would not the company at. least have to say,

"We will reemploy you, but you will have to give, up your
pension"?
MF. AIKENSs

I suspect that the company would although

this would he inconsistent with its—
Q

Are you suggesting the reason that they would

refuse to reemploy him is that he is a retired pensioner, not
that he is too old?
MR. AIKENS:
Q

That is correct.

So, this is a logical extension of his election

to be in the pension plan.

7
MR. AIKENs

His ©lection to be in. the pension plan

and the uniform practice of the company.
Q

Did the cases in the other circuits involve

pension plans where people had the option to elect in or out?
MR. AIKEN:
Q

I believe that—

Eld any of them involve situations where once

you are employed you are under the plan willy-nilly and there
is no way out of it?
MR. AIKEN:

Your Honor, 1 believe each of the cases

involves a plan in which the employer could retain the
employee after the age 60 or whatever it happened to be under
the plan.
Q

I do not understand that.

MR. AIKEN:

The other cases involved plens in which

retirement was not mandatory at a certain age.

The employe©

could ba retained after 60 or whatever the age happened to be
if the employer chose to do so.
Q

Tils sounds like there was not mandatory

retirement at all.
MR. AIKEN:

That is correct.

It is optional on the

part of the company in most of those casas.
Q

There is not. much of a conflict -than, is there?

MR. AIKEN:

Not a conflict within the plans.

There

h?as bi'Ua a conflict within the application of this statute.

Q

You said that whan ha first become employed back

8

in the forties he did not go under the plan. By what process
or steps did ha move to get: under the plan?

Did he apply to

get under it?
MR. AIKENS:

Yes, Your Honor.

In 1364 he apparently

mad© the determination to join the plan and did so.

It was a

voluntary ©lection on his part.
Q

Do you

argue that that was a contract?

I do

not observe in your brief anywhere that you argue that that
constitet.es a contractual undertaking between himself-—a vol­
untary. contractual undertaking—between himself and United.
MR. AIKENS:
contract..

We deem it to b© a

The retirement plan is.
Q

way?

it is, Your Honor.

Does a contract clause enter into this in any

In subsequent legislation the Court would appear to have

invalidated the contract, if there was a contract.
MR. AIKENS:

We do not think that the legislation,

Your Honor, has invalidated.
Q

That is the position of the Court, is it not?

MR. AIKENS:

That was the position of the Fourth

Circuit, yes, Your Honor.
Q

Does that invoke, do you think, the contract

clause?
MR. AIKENS %
Q

We do not believe so, four Honor.

If it is a contract, the statute as construed

has some tendency to parrot, dees it not?

9

MR. AIKENSs

According to the Fourth Circuit,

according -to all other circuits now.
Q

That is all that is in review here, is it not?

MR. AIKENS:

Yes.

Section 4(f)(2) of the statute provides that it shall
not be unlawful for an employer to observe the terms of a
bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit,
plan such as a retirement pension or insurance plan which is
not a subterfuge to evade ths purposes of the act, except that
no such employee benefit plan shall excuse ths failure to hire
any individua1.
Three casas essentially have focused on this
exception, the first of these being the Taft case from the
Fifth Circuit.

And it should be noted, I think, that while it

is alleged that the language of this provision is not, plain,
both Brs-nan and McMann have stated that the language is
unambiguous.

The problem has been the difficulty with applying

the term "subterfuge."

In Taft the Court applied dictionary

definitions, saying that a bona fide plan was a genuine,
authentic, good-faith plan.

It defined subterfuge as deception

by artifice or stratagem, thus applying a state of mind
concept to the definition.

The Court in Taft held that since

th«2 plan xt was involved in there preceded the act by some six
Y ®rs, it obviously could not have been a subterfuge to evade
the purposes of the act.

United agreed with the holding of

10

that case and relied upon it in McMann inasmuch as its plan
was conceded to .be bona fide, paying reasonable benefits, and
had existed some 26 years before the act.
The McMann case rejected that definition and
presumed any early retirement or retirement before the age of
65 to be unlawful.

It said that one must look to a reason

unrelated to age to justify an involuntary retirement.
accordingly, the Court

And,

said that that reason should be a

business or an economic reason.

The Court said that this

conclusion was justified by its review of the history.

And

the history that it looked to was a single reference related
to fehs 4(f)(2) exception.

That history provided that this

section of the act does apply to new and existing plans, that
the exception emphasizes the primary purpose of the bill,
which is hiring.

And it said that. Congress's purpose was to

remove plans as a barrier to hiring parsons within the protected
age group.
The history that the Court relies upon is really
limited to the last phrase of Section 4(f)(2).

This has

sometimes been referred to as the Javits Amendment.

Senator

Javits was extremely concerned that corporations would not hire
persons within the protected age group simply because of the
high cost of putting them into pension or benefit plans for a
vary list tec number of years.

Hs sought, therefor©,, to

eliminate that as a barrier, which of course that exemption

11
has done.

That exemption, however, addresses itself to another

condition as well as this.
Nevertheless, it appears that what th© Fourth
Circuit has done is to say that if there is an economic factor
to be considered in connection with the hiring of an individual,
then there should be an economic factor considered with
respect to involuntary retirement.
that as a criterion.

And so the Court imposed

The distinction, however, is that the

Congress imposed the economic factor with respect to that
portion of the exemption covering hiring; it did not do so as
to involuntary retirement.
Q

Under the Fifth Circuit rule in Taft

Broadcasting any good-faith retirement plan that was estab­
lished prior to the enactment of this statute in 1967 would
permit,' in your .submission, th© involuntary retirement of any
t .ploy;

st whatever age that plan provided; is that correct?
MR. AITENS:
Q

It would, Your Honor.

It could not be a subterfuge; that is your

submission, is that right?
MR. AIXENS;

The Court did not look beyond that.

However, it is interesting that in its definition ©f bon© fide,
th© Taft case did consider not just a plan but a plan which
provides reasonable benefits*
Q

I said a good-faith plan.

Good faith is th©

MR. AIKENS;
Q

The

Yes, that is correct.

Third Circuit took a different view on

that point from the Fifth Circuit, did it not?
MR. AIKENS:
the Zinger case.

The Third Circuit did. Your Honor, in

And the Third Circuit said that it would not

look at the term subterfuge in terms of a mental concept or a
state-of-mind concept.

It looked to the purposes of the act,

and it said that 'the act is primarily aimed at prohibiting
discrimination in hiring practices and in discharging, and that
the act was intended to preserve the retirement plan.
not ban them.

It did

It then made a distinction between a person who

is retired and receiving reasonable benefits and the person
who is totally discharged or who is retired but does not
receive any benefits.

And it said this is the subterfuge,

that person who is harmed because he does not. have benefits.
And this is what the prohibition is aimed at.

It therefore

concluded that subterfuge as used in Section 4(f)(2) means a
sham pi?.-', os, one that does not provide reasonable benefits to
the retirea«
Q

A retirement plan without any benefits is no

different from a discharge.
MR. AIKENS!

That is precisely—the Court equated

the two.
0

At what point would the amount of benefits

distinguish between what is bona fide and what is not?

13
MR. AIKENS:
has ever said
Q

what is reasonable and what is unreasonable.
The statute does not use the word "reasonable.”

MR. AIKENS:
"reasonable/' no.
Q

Ho court, Your Honor, to our knowledge,

And the statute does not use the term

The statuta addresses itself simply to—

To whether or not it is bona fide and whether

or not it is a subterfuge.
MR. AIKENS:

Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

If it provided $10 a month, that might cast some

doubt on its good faith or suggest that it was a subterfuge,
would it not?
MR. AIKENS:
Q

It would, indeed, Your Honor.

I thought it was your submission, Mr. Aikens,

that no plan that had been entered into prior to the enactment
could possibly b© a subterfuge.
MR. AIKENS:

No plan that is a bone fide plan, Your

Honor.
Q

It might or might not be bona fide.

sets up two criteria, does it not?

The statuta

It has to be both bona

fid© and not a subterfuge.
MR. AIKENS:
Q

Is that not right?

MR. AIKENS:

Q

Correct.

That is correct.

And I thought it was your submission that no

plan that antedated the enactment of this legislation could

14
possibly be a subterfuge; it might not be bona fide, but it
could not b© a subterfuge.
MR. AIKENS:

Is that not your submission?

United’s position was consistant, with

the Taft position, that if it is a bona fids plan and did
pre-exist the act, that it would not be a subterfuge.
Q

That it could not be?

MR. AIKENS:
Q

That is correct.

Could a post-act bona fide plan be a subter­

fuge?
MR. AIKENS:
Q
subterfuge?

A post-act plan could or could not be.

A post-act bona fide plan.

How could that b© a

Are not those words mutually inconsistent?

MR. AIKENS:

Some courts have held that something

that is bona fie© cannot be a subterfuge, Your Honor.
G

Is that not redundant?

MR. AIKENS:

It could be said that it is.

If one

were to look at subterfuge and define it not as—or look fc©
its application, could a plan- be genuine but could it have been
put into effect with the provocation of circumventing something,
it might be a subterfuge.
Q

Mr. Aikens, I suppose there is also a theory

which is suggeatsd, although not completely explicit, in the
Third Circuit opinion that when there are adequate pension
benefits, as

opposed to a case in which thera is a discharge

with no pension, you really do net have a discharge within the

15
meaning of the act»
MR» AIKENS:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Do you take that position, or do you rely

exclusively on 4(f)(2)?
MR. AIKENS:

No, Your Honor, we rely both upon Taft

and say that Taft was correct as far as it went and we also
rely upon the Zinger case, the Third Circuit decision.
two decisions are not that far apart.
reach different results.

These

They do not really

The distinguishing difference, I

think, between the two cases is that Taft concludes that a
bona fide plan is one which provides reasonable benefits.

The

Zinger Third Circuit decision uses reasonable benefits to
define the term "subterfuge," and really they arrive at the
sam© result* But "reasonable benefits" is defined in two
differant words.
We believe that the Zinger case too supports the
position of our case.

In that ease the Court, looked to the

legislativ© history.
Q

What ware in fact the benefits received by

Mr. McMenn under this plan?

He did not elect to go under it

until his 51st birthday.
MR. AXKENS:
Q

That is correct.

Ha had only nine years of employment before his

retirement.
MR. AIKENSs

That is correct.

16
Q

What are his benefits in terms of a percentage

of his average wages or highest three-year wages or whatever.
MR. AIKENS:
Honor.

There are two parts to the plan, Your

There is a fixed and there is a variable part.

The

fixed part in this case derives from the contribution of the
employe®.

However, because this was a pilot's plan, subject

feo negotiation and collective bargaining, Mr. McMann only
paid one year under the fixed part.

United pays th© completa

contribution for the fixed part of the portion.

On ‘the

variable part he mad© contributions,
Q

Part of this was part of the collective

bargaining agreement with the ALPA, was it not?
MR. AIKENS:

Yao, that is correct.

The sum that he received from the plan is reduced
by two factors.

Number on©, the fact that h« was a member for

a very short time.

And then secondly at the time of his

retirement, he elected to accept a ten-year option—that is,
a guaranteed payment for ten years—which further reduced it.
This would have amounted in dollars and cents to something
like $450, in that area.
Q

A month?

MR. AIKENS:
Q

What his salary at the time of his retirement?

MR. AIKENSs
Q

That is correct,

I do not know, Your Honor.

You do not know what percentage this was of his

17
salary?
MR. AIKENS:

So, I do not know.

But United, in

view of the fact that this sum was not a very high sum and
certainly not equivalent to on® who would have been a member
©f the plan for 20 or 30 years, made a voluntary contribution
which exceeds what he gets.

Actually the benefits that he

now receives—-they are approximately $850 a month.

Th©

contribution that he receives of course is not out of th®
pension plan.
Q

It is United’s contribution to him.
Does United do that for everybody who has just

been in a plan nine years?
MR. AIKENS:
is unique.

time

No, Your Honor.

We believe that this

Thar© has been a change in circumstances.

At the

that Mr. MoMann joined the company—and he was a pilot—

membership in th© plan was by election.

Now we do not have

that problem because the pilots are automatically enrolled in
the plan.

So that 1 think Mr. McMann is unique in the company

in receiving this additional contribution.
Q

Did they decide to pay it after this lawsuit

or before?
MRo AXKENS:
Q

No, it was at the time of his retirement,

To b@ sure I have got the arithmetic correct,

th® full answer to Justice Stewart’s question is that he is
getting $850 c month, $450 on the pension ancl $400 supplemented
by the voluntary contributions of United?

18
MR. AIKENSt

That is correct, Your Honor.

figures are average figures.

And those

I do not mean to ba specific

about them.
Q

Before his retirement ha had been in touch with

the Labor Department, indicating his intention to proceed
under the statute?
MR. AIKENS
Q

%

Yes, he had.

I suppose United knew about that.

MR. AIKENS:

Yes, it did, and it received the

response of the Labor Department, a copy of that.
In the Zinger case the Court want to a great deal
of difficulty to trace the history of tills act, the legislative
history and to clearly demonstrate that Congress intended to
protect -the pension plan or the retirement plan in 4{f) (2) ,
and that it did create an express exemption, allowing for
involuntary retirements pursuant to that.

That body ©f

history the Fourth Circuit has for some reason chosen to
ignore.

But the history briefly stated is that this was an

administration bill and that the President in submitting the
bill to Congress expressly provided for an exception for those
persons retiring under.pension plans.
Senator davits, who was most active before the
committee's in advocating the plan, recognized also that the
administration's plan which permits involuntary retirement
under a bona fid® plan meets only part of the problem, he said.

19

Obviously then he recognized this as a valid part of 4{£)(2) „
Ha than went on to propose his amendment, which is now the
last phrase of 4(f)(2).
Q

Just so I have got it straight, in order for us

to agree with you, would we have to reach this question and
deal with it as to whether the statute, whether 4(f) or whatever
th© exemption is, covers a plan that is obligatory on the
employ©®- but optional on the employer?

United could have,

under the terms of the plan, retained any employee beyond 60.
MR. AIKENS:
Q

That is correct, Your Hor&r.

And you say they never have.

MR. AIKENS:

In practice it never has.

But it

could.
Q

Certainly

there

was a strong dissent in the

Fifth Circuit with Judge Tuttl© saying exemption was not even
meant to cover a plan that was optional on the employer.

The

Fourth Circuit put that issue aside because it decided against
you on another ground.

What do we do about that, question?

Do w© have to deal with it here?

Assume w® agreed with you

otherwise—
MR. AIKENS:

In the factual context of our cases, it.

does rot have to b© dealt with since we have uniformly—United
has uniformly applied-this.
Q

I know, but the argument is that the company

skill has the option, that th© Congress only intended t© permit

20
th® company to exempt a plan that was obligatory both ways.
That was th® argument in the Fifth Circuit.
MR. MKENS:

Yes, but w® think that the history

belies this and that Congress did not—
Q
for you?

That may b© so, but do we have to reach to hold

Do we have to decide it?
MR. AIKENSs

X do not believe th® Court would have

to decide it in this case, Your Honor.
Q

I thought your submission was that while normal

may not have th® dictionary meaning ©f mandatory, that in fact
it. was equivalent to mandatory under your plan as it has been
historically administered, and that is what Professor Cox
found in th® arbitration.
MR. AIKENS:

That is what Professor Cox found, and

that is what the Fourth Circuit conceded.
Q

Normal means mandatory in fact.

MR. AIKENS:
Q

Normal in this case means mandatory.

As a matter of the historic administration of

this plan.
MR. AIKENS:
Q

Yes.

And that was a unanimous decision of th©

arbitration panel, was it not?
MR. AIKENSs
Q

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

Mr. Aikens, am I correct, is there not some

legislation pending in the Congress today that ties right into

21

this problem?
MR. AIKENS:

There is.

And ife is my understriding,

Your Honor, that, the House has passed a bill and a bill is
pending in the Senate.
Q

Does it have any bearing ©n this case?

MR. AIKENS;
case.

It does not have any boaring on this

Mr. McMaim is of course affected by this, and any new

bill will not be retroactive.

Others who have been retired

pursuant to—-involuntarily retired pursuant to plans are also
affected by the ruling of this case.
Q

You realise of course that a large majority of

this Court is beyond th© age ©f 60.

Do you think we should

all recuse ourselves and let you go elsewhere?
MR. AIKENS;
Q

No, Your Honor.

No, I dc not.

Dual capacity.

MR. AIKENS:

That is correct.

Your Honor, we respectfully submit that the Four fell
Circuit's decision is in error and that it should be reversed
and that the Court should follow the rulings of Taft and
Zinger.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. McBride, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS G. MCBRIDE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MCBRIDE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is © case of first impression.

It is the very

first case which this Court has ever considered under the
Age Discrimination Employment Act of 1967.

The kind of

determination that the Court will have to make has been made
many times before by this Court.

Specifically this Court, must

decide what the import of the language used by Congress
and it must also examine what Congress Intended bo do when it
passed the legislation.
Tha language of the statute which is involved,
particularly Section 4(f)(2) „ requires that in order to com©
under that exception, a pension plan must be both bona fide and
not a subterfuge to evade tha purposes of tha act.

The purposes

of the act at© s«it out in Section 2 of the act.

Clearly

Congress stated them as explicitly as possible.

They are to

allow ©Icier workers to obtain and to retain employment.
Q

Do you distinguish between the purposes of the

23
act the languages of the act. in any way?
MR. McBRIDE:
is clear.

No.

I think the language of the act

Section 4(f)(2) incorporates by reference basically

the provisions of Section 2, which state the purposes.

The

purposes I think are essential to this Court's consideration
of the question.

Also Section 4(a) of the act,where the

actual prohibitions of age discrimination are enumerated,
provides that there can be no discrimination in employment
when the sols

criterion for that, whatever action, is the age

of the person involved.
Q

Da you accept the Fourth Circuit’s character-

ination of the plan as being & bons. fide plan?
MR. McBRIDE:

The question down there was presented

to its©, and I said I agreed with them that it was bona fids in
the sens® that it doss pay substantial benefits.
generally that the plan is bons fide.
fide, yes.

I agree

United’s plan is bona

However, the question before the Court primarily

is whether or not the plan is a subterfuge to evade the
purposes of fcho act.

I think it is very important for the

Court to be aware that the purposes are as I stated, to let
older workers be employed.
Q

Or younger workers.

It is equally in violation

of the act to discriminate against somebody because of his
youth, is it not?
MR. McBRIDE:

The act itself only applies between the

24

ages of 40 and 65, Your Honor.
Q

Or discriminat® against somebody because he is

only 40.
MR. McBRIDE*
turned 40.

That is correct, or because he has

I do not think that was discriminating because of

youth.
Q

Maybe not in the mind of Congress, but. that

is what the language of the statute says.
MR. McBride;

The language does in fact have that

import, yes.
Q

Would you violate the act, in your view, if the

company refused to permit a man 41 years old to begin pilot
training and apply for a pilot's job if he had no previous
flying experience?
MR. McBRIDE;

That would foe a vary difficult question,

Your Honorp primarily because of the necessary extent and
expense of training someone to become & pilot.

But in that

case, if that kind of discriminatory result was allowed, it
would not be allowed because a man was 41; it would be allowed
because of a business reason.

In other words, the company

would not be able to realistically finance that kind of
training necessary for a person to become a pilot.

So, that

would fiv in with what the Fourth Circuit had in mind whan it
said a, business or economic reason.
Q

That is covered bv the BFOQ language of the

25
statute , is it, not?
MR. MCBRIDE:

No, that would not be the BFOQ

language.
Q

It might, I also should add, be covered by the

FAA regulations and perhaps also by the agreement between the
company and the ALFA.
MR. McBRIDE:
no minimum entry age.

Even if it was, the FAA regulation has
But if it was within the scop© of the

contract—for example, if th© contract said, "We will not
hir® anyone over the age of 40 to become a pilot"—that would
be similar to the present case.

And whether that provision

would be allowed to stand in the contract; would become a
question of whether it was permissible under the act.

The act

would have clear priority over that kind of question.
Q

Since I have already interrupted you, am I

correct in my understanding that in your answer to the
Chief Justice's questions you made clear that in your view at
least whether

something,

is

bona fide is quit® a different

question from whether or not it is a subterfuge?

And by

something I mean a pension plan.
MRo MCBRIDE:
Q

Definitely.

That they ar© two separate and quite distinct

tests?
MR. McBRIDE:
Q

Right.

Yes.

Congress used both terms.

And we have fc© assume that they meant

26

differant things when they use both—
MR. McBRIDE:

They meant different things.

That

is correct.
Q

--that they war® not indulging in tautology.

And your understanding of the meaning of bona fide is that
tha plan provid«;s reasonable benefits?
MR. McBRIDE:

That is the working definition that

©very court which has considered th® question has used.
Whether or not that is precise-™
Q

Or complete.

MR. McBRIDE;

--or complete has not; really been an

issue.
Q

But at least that is one criterion—

MR. McBRIDE;
Q

That is one criterion.

--of whether or rot th© plan provides reasonable

benefits?
MR. McBRIDE;
Q

Yes, that is correct.

Retirement benefits.

And then what is the test

in your submission—what is the meaning in your submission of
whether or not the plan is a subterfuge?
MR. McBRIDE;
Q

The primary test—

It has nothing to do with reasonable benefits?

MR. McBRIDE;
reasonable benefits.

No, it has nothing to dc with
The primary test becomes a question of

whether or not the criterion

used is a criterion which is

27
prohibited by the act.

In other words, if age is the sole

reason for an action, a discriminatory action, then that
becomes™
Q

Let ns not, if we can help it, use polar words.

If it is the sole reason for manadatory retirement under 65;
is that what you mean?
MR. McBRlDE;

Yes.

It becomes a subterfuge because

the purpose of the act and the prohibitions of the act ar©
against the terminations based
Q

solely upon age.

Then any pension plan, even though it provided

reasonable ban®fits and was therefor© bona fide, would nonethelass be a subterfuge and not covered by this exception to
i

the general provisions of the act if it in fact provided for
mandatory retirement under 65, unless there v ere some; what?—
other reason.

MR. McBRlDEj

Unless there were some other reason,

yse.
Q

And would that other reason have to.be some

economic or occupational or—

MR. McBRlDE;

It could be economic or business

reason, or it. could be an outside ruling by the federal
government such as if a person was a firefighter and the
Congress decides that firefighters should b© exempt from—or
that involuntary retirement of firefighters should be allowed.
even though--

28

Q

Motorcycle policemen or something like that.

MR, McBRIDE;

—it may not be a bona fid© occupational

qualification, if there is this type of ruling, that would
allow the involuntary retirement,
Q

Mr. McBride, I would think the dictionary

definition of a subterfuge is something that says one thing
and means another, something that purports t© be okay but
really is not.

And by your interpretation of it, a contract

that says in so many words r "W© are going to retire you at
65 or 60 and give you these pension benefits," makes it
perfectly clear and does not dissemble at all, is nonetheless
a subterfuge.
MR. McBRIDE:

Y&&, Your Honor.

I think that the—

what shall w© say?—-sinister action type of definition of
subterfuge is net applicable in this case,
Q

it has to be s. subterfuge to evade the purposes

of this act.
MR. MCBRIDE:
Q

That is true.

But in order to be a subterfuge to ©vad© the

purposes of the act it has to be a subterfuge to start out
with.
MR. McBRIDE:

But I do not think that the term

"subterfuge” implies any malicious intent or any deliberate
going around the act.

In fact, the result may be a subterfuge

although the. intanfc may not necessarily be that to get around

29

the acto

And also it is again the purposes of the act which

are important in this case,
Q

Prior to the passage of the act, was it in any

sens® a subterfug©?
MR* McBRIDE:

I do not think I can really answer the

question because prior to fee passage of the act there was no
legislative purpose that would be avoided by the subterfuge.
Before fee act was passed, the plan would have been bona fide,
but as far as the question of whether it was a subterfuge or
not, I do not believe it would really have ary relevance
because there was nothing to relate it to.
Q

la order for you t© prevail, do you think that

you have t© show that this plan was a subterfuge as that
term is used in the act?
MR. McBRIDE:
Q

Wo.

I think the—

What other grounds could you prevail on?

MR. McBRIDEs

I think that we could prevail upon the

terras of the pension plan itself.

The pension plan states that

fee normal retirement date shall be the 60th birthday of the
participant.

Thu United Air Lines plan which is involved her©

did have a provision for superannuated employment of someone
beyond that normal retirement data.

The Fourth Circuit did

not reach the question then; it was not necessary to reach that
question under the grounds for the decision of the Fourth
Circuit.

They took a rather

broader approach to the problem

30

and 'therefor© did not get involved in the question of whether
or not the plan itself would have been adequate,, presuming they
had agreed with United's interpretation of the statute to
involuntarily retire Mr. McMann.
Q

Mr. McBride, to what extent does collective

bargaining have to do with this?
MR. McBRIDEs
Q

With the retirement age?

Nothing.

But it was a part of collective bargaining,

was it not?
MR. McBRIDE;

The retirement age was never a part

of tli©—
Q
J

Retirement plan.

MR. McBRIDE;
situation.

The retirement plan—it is an unusual

As I understand it, only portions of the pension

plan have been bargained for.

The original United Air Lines

pension plan was established in 1941.
retirement date for pilots was 60.

At that time the

That date has maintained

itself throughout all of the alterations to the plan, including
the current edition.
Q

You mean each change in the plan was negotiated

with the union?
I

MR, McBRIDE:
union.

It was partially negotiated with the

The relevant portions of the plan which, w© are

concerned with ware never a subject of collective bargaining.
Q

Could they have been?

31

MR. McBRIDE:
been.

1 believe they probably could have

But, as a practical matter, I do not believe that any

result would have com© of that, for several reasons.

Primarily

the company has always maintained the ago 60 date was necessary,
and the Air Line Pilots Association has never agreed with
that.

And X would think it highly unlikely that any

meaningful result would have come of putting it on the
bargaining table.
Q

Would it have mad© any differ@is.cfi, had it been

the result of collective bargaining?
MR. McBRIDE:

X do not think so, no.

I think it

would be the same situation that w@ have hare new.
*

Q

The statute regardless of—

MR. McBRIDE:

The statute regardless cf the contract.

X do not think there is any problem with the pra-existing
plan question.

The legislative history mad© it quite clear

that Congress intended the act to apply to both existing and
new plan .

And there ars many decisions primarily in Circuit

Courts—
Q

I have great difficulty in how you can say that

this was meant to apply to plans previously adopted, the
4

following language:
chapter.'

"A subterfuge to evade the purpose ©f this

I do not see how that could apply to a plan that

was adopted before unless they had a crystal ball.
MR. McBRIDE:

Again, it is a question of subterfuge

32

to evade the purposes of the act.

The subterfuge can come

into being when a plan is operated so that age is a basis for
the decision.
Q

After the act.

MR. McBRlDE:

After the act.

Then it becomes a

subterfuge to evade the purposes of the act.
Q

That is what th®. Fourth Circuit in effect held.

MR. McBRlDE;

That is what th® Fourth Circuit in

effect held, right.
Q

So, the day before th© act became effective,

it was not a subterfuge, you say, because there was no yardstick
by which to measure.

But the effective date of the set it

automatically became a subterfuge?
MR. MCBRIDE;
Q

To evade the act.

MR. McBRlDE;
Q

Yes.

The purposes of th® act, yes.

1 thought you said there is no difference

between the purposes of the act and the act.
MB., McBRlDE;

Th® statute speaks in terms of the

purposes of the act.
Q

Could you not indicat® that the words :,th©

purposes of51 are redundant and the result would be th® same if
it said "the act" or "the chapter”?
MR. McBRlDE;

I think th© phrase "purposes of th© act,”

makes it much clearer, ©specially in light of the way the act

33

has been interpreted by soma courts.

Some courts—Zinger and

Taft—have obviously considered th® act rather -than the
purposes.

I do not think there is any difference.

But, as I

said, there appears to ba some question about it.
Q

Hr. McBride, did I correctly understand you a

few moments ago to say that you do not have to urg© affirmance
on th© subterfuge argument but may do so on the basis that the
plan indeed does not mandate retirement at aga 60—
MR. Mc-BRIDB:
Q

That is correct.

—even though th® Fourth Circuit expressly

said it concludes, for purposes of this dc.cisil.on, teat th® plan
should be required as on® mandating retirement.
)

You did not

cross petition but you nevertheless argue., I gather, that you
are at liberty to ask affirmance on th® basis that th© Court
of Appeals was wrong in that respect?
MR. McBRXDE:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor, yes.

Mr. McBride, do you have any comment on the

pending legislation in Congress?
MR. McBRXDE:

Yes, 1 do, Your Honor.

comments on the pending legislation.

X have several

The pending legislation,

which has been approved by the House of Representatives by a
I

vote of 359 to 4 specifically pertains t© Section 4(f)(2).
Th® language of one particular portion of the language which is
being added is that it adds to Section 4(f)(2) th® phrase
"and except th® involuntary retirement of any employe© shall

34
not b© required or permitted by any such seniority system or
any such employee benefit plan because of the age of the
employee.M

Thar® has been considerable legislative history

so far on these amendments.

The House report, Ho. S5-527,

speaks of this particular amendment as being one to clarify
the act because of the varying judicial interpretations.
Q

If that is enacted, what is left of the

exception?
MR. McBRIDE:

If this is enacted, you still have the

problem of whether or not there can be a discrimination not
so much on involuntary retirement grounds but, as we submit
the purpose of th© act is now, whether you can discriminate,
for example, with regard to a health insurance program because
of the prohibitive cost.
Q

Would you read that language again.

MR. MCBRIDE:
Q

This is an addition to <2>, if it?

MR. McBRIDE:
Q

Yes.

This is an addition to Section 4(f)(2).

It is the only addition t© (2)?

MR. McBRIDE:

Yes, Your Honor.

"And except that the

involuiri ry retirement of any employee shall not be required
or permitted by any such seniority system or any such employ®©
benefit plan because of the age of the employee."
Q

Has the discussion over there made clear

whether or not that would apply to previously negotiated plans

35

which operate in future though?
MR.

mcBRSDE:

I think

the discussion during the

original act mad© that clear, Your Honor, that it was intended
to apply to present plans and also that this would apply to
present plans as well.
Q

Thera, have been amendments to that; ha.v© there

not; in some committee exempting teachers and professors?

We

really do net know what shape the thing might coma out as a
law.

This is a bill that was passed by the House.

Also, Your Honor, there has been

considerable legislative history in the House and in the Senate
regarding this, and they make it quit© clear that tha Fourth
Circuit decision is in lino with what the original intent of
Congress was

Q

This is 1967?

MR, MCBRIDE:
Q

Wall, the—

That is when the act was passed,

MR. McBride:
in 1967 and in 1977.

I realize that.

There is language both

When dealing with the 1977 amendments

which have been proposed, Congress has been aware of the
varying interpretations of the provision by the different
circuits, and they have specifically mentioned in some
instances this particular case.
Senator Javits, for example, when he was introducing
the amendment in the Senate, stated that the purpose of this
amendment was to facilitate the hiring of older employees by
p@rmitti.ng their employment without n@ce5Jsari.ly providing
equal benefits undor employee benefit plans.
Q

Now you are back in 1967?

MR. MCBRIDE:
Q

No, this is 1977.

He said a similar thing back in 1967.

MR. McBRIDE:

He said similar things in 1967, but

h® also added, before the Supreme Court considers the arguments
about what the Congress has intended by Section 4(f)(2), I think
it is incumbent that the Congress make clear that this provision
was never intended -to permit the wholesale evasion of the
ADEA's protections.
A3.30 Senator Williams on the Senate flocr stated
that the bill, the 1977 bill, makes it clear that, the Fourth

37

Circuit correctly interpreted the will of Congress.
Q

Are Senator Javits* remarks some sort of ax

post facto legislative history of the earlier act?
MR. McBRIDE:

Not. really * Your Honor.

To a degree

they are, but they are very consistent with what he said in
1967,

They are snore roaffirmance than something completely

33

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continua,

Mr. McBride.
MR. McBRIDE:

There are a few more points 1 would

like to clarify{, Your Honor.

First of all, I think th©

position of the department has been mentioned by Mr. Aikens-the Department of Labor.

Although there was an initial

determination by a person in tha field, it has never been the
official position ©f the Department of Labor.

In fact, the

Department did file an amicus brief in the Fourth Circuit, and
they have assisted in the preparation of my case.
Q

Eut they have not filed an amicus brief here.

MR. McBRIDE:
Q

Mo, they have not, Your Honor.

Is there any significance in that?

MR. McBRIDE:

Non©.

Their position has not changed.

1 believe at on© time they were planning to file an amicus
brief t and I am certain they would be happy to .if the Court
were to request th© Solicitor General to file one.
Q

They frequently do it on their own.

MR. McBRIDE:
Q

I realise that.

And I wondered whether there was soma signifi­

cance in there, th® absence of such a brief.
FIR. McBRIDE:

No, there was no significance.

position is tha same.
Q

I suppos® you might suggest it is on® of

Their

39

benevolent neutrality?
MR. McBRIDE:
actively in ©ur behalf.

No,

I would suggest that they are

In fact, to a large extent, the

decision of the Fourth Circuit was based on their amicus
brief.
Q

Mr. McBride, I do not like to press this again,

but I would likes to b® very clear.

You are arguing to us that

you are entitled to affirmance ©n one of two grounds, either
that 4(f) (2) was not applicable at all because this is not a
mandatory retirement, or @v©n if 4(f) (2) is applicable, its
conditions have not bean satisfied by United; in that right?
MR. McBRIDE:
Q

On either ground?

MR. McBRIDE:
Q

That is correct.

On either ground, yes, sir.

Mr. McBride, did the department over withdraw

its earlier interpretive bulletins?
MR. McBRIDE:

The published interpretive bulletins

have never been withdrawn, no.
Q

Are they not contrary to your pressent view?

MR. McBRIDE:

No, they are not.

What the interpretive

bulletin does, it incorporates by reference the requirements
of Section 4(f)(2).
Q

Do you think the Department of Labor, if it was

here and a representative was standing where you are, would
suggest that, their position in their amicus brief is not

40

different from their interpretive bulletin?
MR. McBRIDEs

That is correct,, Your Honor.

Basically

the position of the Department of Labor—
Q

Does that brief argue that their position has

always been the same?
MR, McBRIDE;

with respect to the requirements--

with respect to there being some other outside requirements,
y©s„

As a matter of fact, during the original hearings on

the 1967 bill, eilthough United and the Chamber of Commerce
quoted Secretary of Labor Wirtz, ha also stated in the House
hearings that the bill does recognize, on the one hand—
specifically recognizes those plans that &r© worked out for
rational reasons so long as they do not result in differentia­
tion just on tfc® basis of ag© itself where there is no
justification in fact, which is precisely the. situation which
wa have hero.
Th© legislative history which has been presented to
the Court is not complete, and I would urge that the Court
study th© legislative history in its entirety.
The -position of th© department, as indicated by the
remark I just quoted by Secretary Wirtz, has always bean that
there

b® something other than just age, end they have not

changed this position.
On© other factual thing which I think I should clear
up—

41
Does the deparfcmsnt agrae with you on your

q

alternat® suggestion that the exemption does not apply at all
if the company may itself permit a person to stay beyond the
retirement age?
MR. McBRIDE%
Q

I am not certain of that.

Let me read you the interpretive bulletin.

"The fact that an employer may decide to permit certain
employees to continue working beyond the age stipulated in
the formal retirement program does not in and of itself
render an otherwise bona fid© plan invalid,"
MR. McBRIDE;
Q
I

I» that vagu©?

No, I d© not believo that is vague.

At least the interpretive bulletin seems

contrary t© your alternate position.
f

MR, McBRIDE;
Q

That may b@.

Bo you think the department stands by its '

interpretive bulletin in that respect?
MR. McBRIDE:

I really could not say.

I believe that

they would urge that the decision be affirmed or. th© alternate
ground.

I really cannot speak with certainty about th®

position of the

department on that particular aspect of the

case, Your Honor.
j

Q

So, you think that they would have abandoned

their interpretive bulletin?
MR. McBRIDE;
would have abandoned it.

I do not think that they necessarily
I think they probably 'would take the

42
position that it wag—
Q

Wrong?

MR. McBRIDE:

Not wrong—not artfully done the first

time around, and if they had another chance at it, they would
perhaps use different language.
Q

Of * course, the Department of Labor had no

barriers to pr@sent.ing its views to this Court, and
departments of the government frequently do.
MR. McBRIDE;

I am aware of that, 'four Honor.

I

think they did in fact plan to do it, but there was, I under­
stand t a tima problem in -the Solicitor General's office
which was the reason for it not. being filed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 3URGER:
