MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Frisch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S'* FRISCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE'PETITIONER
MR. FRISCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented by this case is whether a fine
or requirement of restitution may be imposed upon one sentenced
to probation under the terms of the Federal Youth Corrections
Act, 18 U.S.C., Sec. 5010(a).
Each Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Federal law before a United States
Magistrate in Maryland and each was placed on probation under
the terms of the Youth Act, Petitioner Rice being sentenced
under the terms of that. Act which extends it to young adult
offenders.

Each was ordered to pay a fine to the United States

and,additionally, Petitioner Burst was ordered to make resti­
tution on a stolen check.
The District Court in this case and the other lower
‘ederal courts which have held fines to be permissible under
the Youth Act, have essentially relied upon two sections of
the statute and inferred from these two sections a Congressional
intent to permit fines

4
The first of these sections is Section 5023(a) of
Title 18, which in effect incorporates the adult probation
statute, Section 3^51 of Title 18, into the Youth Act, and,
of course, have reasoned that since fines are a permissible
condition of probation for adults, they are also permissible
under the Youth Act,
What we respectfully suggest that this argument
ignores is that the power to impose a fine does not originate
with Section 3651, rather it originates with the substantive
statute under which a person is convicted.
We respectfully suggest to the Court that when one
:Ls sentenced under the Youth Act, once a finding of benefit is
made under that Act, once one is deemed to be worthy of the
treatment and rehabilitation provided for by that Act, they
are no longer punished for the offense, as provided for by
Tule 3651, rather they are made subject to the treatment and
rehabilitation of the Act.

And, as a result of that, we suggest

that reference to 3651, which cannot be read as a penalty
provision, within Itself, can in no way be read in such a way
as to permit fines under the Youth Act.
Now, the question might naturally arise, what was
the purpose of enacting 5023(a) by Congress if it were not to
Impose fines?

And, unfortunately, the legislative history, with

regard to the Act, is not really very helpful in this regard.
There are, perhaps, however, a number of reasons why 5023 may

5
have been enacted rather than to permit fines.

I think, perhaps,

she best of these reasons has to do with the nature of the Youth
Act itself.

Congress knew when it enacted the Youth Act that

It did not create any specialized programs of treatment and
rehabilitation for Youth Act probationers, as opposed to those
sentenced under the imprisonment provisions of 5010(b),
Realizing that. Congress made it quite clear by enacting
5023(a) that v/hat ever programs of treatment and rehabilitation
were available to adults, under 3651, are made equally available;
to youth, offenders by the operation cf 5023(a),
Additionally, the argument has been made and adopted
by a number of judges in the -district Court in Maryland that
;,s a result of the operation of 5023(a) in the Incorporation of
the General Probation statute, that a split sentence can be
Imposed under the Youth Act.

That is to say a sentence of

imprisonment of up to six months to be followed by a period of
probation,and by doing this it gives a court, in effect, the
middle ground between 5010(a) and 5010(b), without requiring
the indeterminant sentence of up to four years,
Additionally, a fair reading of 3651,which we suggest
to this Court, demonstrates that an intent to fine does not

exist, fairly clearly — well, absolutely clearly sets out that
restitution is permissible under the Youth Act, and we are
prepared to concede that at this time,

It's quite clear under

3651 that restitution is a permissible condition of probation,

6
The second section of the statute the courts have
relied upon in order to permit fines under the Youth Act is,
in fact, a change in the original language, the proposed language,'
of 5010(b), which originally read that imprisonment under the
Touth Act was in lieu of penalty otherwise provided by law,
and this was changed in the present form of the law to
penalty of imprisonment.

And there is a letter cited in the

Government*s brief in support of the proposition that this
permits fines.
In response to that, we would make two arguments to
the Court.

First, and most importantly, 5010(b) is not the

issue before this Court.

That is a separate and distinct

sentencing alternative from 5010(a) and not the one for a
decision in this case.
As Mr, Chief Justice Burger, in Dorszynski v. United
0
jf i

bates, stated at page 43, "the Act creates two new sentencing

alternatives.”

And the one before this Court is the probation

alternative, not the incarceration alternative.

States.

That's not just an ordinary letter you

ffl. FRISCH:
QUESTION:

.

That'S correct. Your Honor.
We received the impression it was just

a letter.

MR* FRX3CH:

Well, it was a letter written to the

7
House Committee considering the bill, I believe transmitted
from the Judicial Conference that considered the Youth Act.
QUESTION:

From the Attorney General of the United

States.
MR. FRISCH:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Secondly, if the Court —
QUESTION:

And it said explicitly a fine was to be

Lnc lud ed.
MR, FRISCH:

That's correct, with reference to (b),

Your Honor*
QUESTION:
MR, FRISCH:

And that was the reason for the amendment.
That’s correct, Your Honor*

If the Court is convinced -QUESTION:

Have you anything against that, any

legislative history to contradict that?
MR. FRISCH:

No, I don't, Your Honor*

But I think

the important point to be made is that letter and the change
in language was with reference to the incarceration alternative,
I would direct the Court's attention to the language
in 5010(a) which states that the sentencing judge may suspend
imposition or execution of sentence.

If Congress was aware of

the necessity to change the language with respect to (b) to
add the language "in lieu of penalty of imprisonment," I think
the question might reasonably be asked why a similar change was
not enacted as to (a) and why that same limiting language was

8
ict put Into (a).
The Government, in its brief, I believe, responds to
this argument by stating that it would be illogical to conclude
;hat Congress Intended fines with respect to the incarceration
alternative, but not with respect to probation,
I would suggest to the Court that there is a logical
distinction between people sentenced under
sentenced under 5010(a),

and people

I believe a sentencing judge makes

a qualitative distinction between one who is in need of the
incarceration alternative and one who is only in need of
probation supervision and that this shows a different type of
person that is being treated by the court with respect to (b),
as opposed to (a),
QUESTION:

What about restitution?

Would your same

argument as to fines apply to a requirement that the defendant
nave restitution?
MR* FRISCH:

No, Your Honor, I am prepared to concede

nhat restitution is proper from a fair reading of Section 3651.
' believe distinction

;t.o be made between fines and restitution

is that the power to impose restitution resides right in the
probation statute.

With respect to fines, it refers back to

the substantive offense which a person has committed.
The final concern of courts that have found fines to
be permissible under the Act is that to hold otherwise would
deny the benefits of the Act to otherwise qualified young

9
offenders, and I can’t state to the Court that this is not at
least a possibility.

However, I would hope that sentencing

judges, particularly those cognizant of Mr. Justice Marshall {s
concurring; opinion in the Jorszynski case which described the
Youth Act as a "preferred sentencing alternative," would still
ureat it as such and not deny the benefits of the Youth Act to
an otherwise qualified individual, merely because Congress did
:iot provide for a fine in the sentencing scheme.
Secondly, having conceded that restitution is
permissible and appropriate under the Act in the correct case,
i would think that in most cases where a fine would be called

for, where the individual had either financially profited from
his offense or caused his victim -- caused some loss, the fact
what restitution is available under the Act might go a long way
toward curing that concern of the Fourth Circuit and the other
courts that have permitted fines with respect to denying the
benefits cf the Act.
And, regardless of that, we do suggest to the Court
what the real issue here is one of statutory construction, one
of a fair reading of the Act, and although fines may be a wise
policy under the Act, that is not the question before this
Court,

It's merely a question of what Congress provided for.

And that a fair reading of this Act, reading 3651 and the
change in language with respect to 5010(b) is Simply not a
sufficient indicator of Congress* intent as to this penalty.

Unless there are any questions, I would like to
reserve five minutes for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Solicitor General,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALE H. MoCREE, JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
Mr, McCree:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Government contends that the decision of the
Court of Appeals is supported not only by the literal terms of
the Youth Corrections Act, but also by the Act's legislative
history.
/

The provisions under which Petitioners were sentenced,
18

Section 5010(a), provide that .!,if the Court is of ..the

opinion that the youth offender does not need commitment, it
may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place
he youth offender on probation."
Now, nothing in this provision, or in any other
provision of the Act, precludes the Imposition of a fine, and
since my brother concedes that restitution is not proscribed,
3 won't labor that.
Indeed, Section 5023(a) of the Act expressly provides
that nothing in this chapter "shall limit or affect the power
cf any court to suspend the imposition or execution of any

11
sentence and place a youth offender on probation,, or be con­
strued in anywise to amend, repeal or affect the provisions
of 18 U.3.C., Section 3651, relative to probation."

When we

advert to 3651, we find that language provides "while on
probation and among the conditions thereof, the defendant may
be required to a fine in one or several sums, and may be
required to make restitution or reparation."
Now, 1 understand my brother to concede that this
statutory provision that permits the court to require resti­
tution as found in 3651, eliminates that element from the
consideration of the Court in this appeal.

And I submit it

similarly eliminates from this Court's consideration his con­
tention that a fine might not be imposed.
And I think, probably, we could conclude our
argument at this point.

I would emphasize that the letter of

Attorney General Biddle, as the Court has suggested in its
questioning, Is not a mere letter, but It’s a letter that
purports to communicate to the Congress the consensus of all
the interested persons outside of the Legislature that were
considering this piece of legislation, the Judicial Conference
>f the United States and the department of Justice, Including
the Bureau of Prisons and the Parole Board.

I think it makes

it very clear that fines were not to be proscribed, and in the
words of this Court in Lorszynskr, the purpose of the Youth
Corrections Act is, indeed, to afford additional sentencing

12
options to the district court.
We submit that with counsel's concession, and with
that view of the statute, that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is eminently correct, as indeed it was in Oliver -QUESTION:

Does 3651 permit the imposition of fines

as a condition of probation when the underlying statute doesn't
impose a fine?
MR, McCHEE:

I would not so contend,

I would suggest

that it permits the imposition of a fine only when the under­
lying statute calls for fine and/or imprisonment.

And, it does.

Indeed, in this case,
QUESTION:

Does', in this case, except they don't

sentence him under that provision, do they?
MR, MeCREE:

No, they do not sentence ...him-under

".hat provision,
QUESTION;
MR, MeCREE:
was committed.

Nor under 3651.
hell, 3651 incorporates the offenso that

It brought the person before the court by reason

of the indictment.
If the Court has no further questions, the Government
will submit its argument at this point,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General,
Jo you have anything further, Mr, Frisch?
MR.9 FRISCH:

No,
