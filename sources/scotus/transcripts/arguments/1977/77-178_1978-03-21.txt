MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in Robertson v. Wegmann.
Mr. Monroe, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM W. MONROE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MONROE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute.
The original plaintiff, Clay Shaw, filed suit under section
1983 of the Civil Rights Act against Jim Garrison, then
District Attorney of Orleans Parish, State of Louisiana, and
certain alleged co-conspirators including petitioner, a prom­
inent New Orleans businessman.
The plaintiff claimed violation of his constitutional
rights in connection with the District Attorney's prosecution
of him for a New Orleans based conspiracy to assassinate
President Kennedy, and the District Attorney's subsequent
attempt to prosecute Shaw for perjury.
During the pendency of his civil rights action, Shaw
died.

He was a bachelor, leaving no spouse, child, parent, or

sibling, but only a will naming a friend as residuary legatee
of his estate.

The executor of Shaw's estate, the respondent

here today, was permitted over objections of defendants to
substitute himself as plaintiff.

The defendants moved to dismiss

4
the action because it did not survive Shaw’s death under the
law of Louisiana, under which law t?aare is provision for
survival of actions in favor of the stated familial benefici
aries only.
QUESTION:

Is that because of the nature of the

action, or does that apply across the board to any —
MR. MONROE:

There is a distinction in the Louisiana

law of survivorship between actions for damage to property as
opposed to personal actions.

As to all personal actions, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, the limitation as to the rights of a
familial beneficiary are in force.
And the further basis, of course, of that motion being dismissed was that under section 1988 of the Civil Rights
Act, the law of Louisiana providing for the limited survivorship must be applied to this action.
The District Court denied the defendant's motions
and on interlocutory appeal the Fifth Circuit affirmed the
District Court's holding that a federal consnon law of absolute
survivorship of section 1983 actions should be formulated
since the state law to which the federal courts must look
under section 1988 does not permit this action to survive, and
is therefore'inconsistent with the purposes of the Civil Rights
Act, despite both courts' acknowledgement that the Civil Rights
Act is entirely, silent as to survivorship in 1983 actions.
This is a case which has been charged with considerable

5
emotion, arising as it does from the assassination of a
President of the United States, and the subsequent prosecution
by the District Attorney of Orleans. Parish of a well-known
New Orleans businessman for his alleged role in the conspiracy,
alleged conspiracy to perpetrate that assassination.
The extent of that emotion is perhaps reflected by
the referral by the Court of Appeals and the respondent to
Shav/'s injunction suit against the District Attorney, as con­
stituting established facts in this case, although neither
Petitioner Robertson nor Garrison's other co-defendants in the
Civil Rights Act action were defendants in that injunction suit,
and obviously

any

findings there would not be binding on

than in this proceeding.
And also by respondent's repeated references to the
District Court's characterisation of the matter as one of the
most bizarre episodes in American political and legal history, and
the Court of Appeals' designation of facts of this case as
i

Kafkaesque, although this matter has been before both of those
courts simply on defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint.
QUESTION:
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:
MR. MONROE:

Are all of the defendants still living?
All of the defendants are still living.
And is Mr. Garrison still the prosecutor?
No, sir, he is not.

He has been in

private practice for several years and is readying his candi­
dacy for the State Court of Appeals.

6

QUESTION:

He was the only state agent, wasn't he?

MR. MONROEs
QUESTION:

Thera is one other —
There is somebody else in his office?

MR. MONROE:

•— who was alleged to be a member of

his staff, Dr. Patter.
QUESTION:
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:
MR. MONROE:

But your client is a private citizen?
That is correct, sir.
Is and was?
That's correct, sir.

Especially in light of this emotional background of
the case, the holding of the two lower courts, refusing to
apply the state law of survivorship to this case, pursuant to
section 1988, since that law would not permit this action to
continue, and instead fabricating out of new cloth a federal
common law of absolute survivorship, brings to our mind the
dissentingopinion of Mr. Chief Justice Burger in the Nixon
case when he said, "Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking of the tendency
of great cases, by hard cases to make bad law, went on to
observe the dangers inherent when sane accident of immediate
overwhelming interest appeals to the feelings and distorts the
judgment.

These immediate interests exercise a kind of

hydraulic pressure which makes what previously seemed clear
seem doubtful and before which even well-settled principles of
law will bend."
The petitioner is here today before this Court seeking

to neutralize the past hydraulic pressures in this case and to
restore the settled principles of law which have been bent by
the courts below.

We may start then with the basic principle

that there has never been any common law rule, federal or
state, of survivorship of personal actions.

Thus, we submit

that survivorship of an action is quite different from the
matter of recoverable damages, which was the question we be­
lieve was sought to be presented to this Court in Jones v.
Hildebrandt, and as to which there have been established
federal riiles which the federal courts have chosen to follow,
rather than state rules, as was the case when the Third Circuit
in Basista v. Weir.
As to survivorship of actions, however, we reiterate
that there has never been any such federal rule to be utilised.
A further basic principle recognised by the Firth Circuit in
its earlier Brasier v. Cherry, is that any amelioration of
the harshness of the principle of abatement of actions upon
death of the injured person must come from legislation.

That

is certainly as much American rule as is the need for legisla­
tive authority for the award of attorneys fees which was
acknowledge by this Court in Alyeska Pipeline Service Company
v. Wilderness Society.
Turning then to the Civil Rights Act, it also stands
beyond question that Congress made no provision for survival
of civil rights actions under 1983.

Both courts below readily

8

conceded that point, as have all courts as far as we are aware
which have considered this question, and certainly this Court
in Moor

v. County of Alameda also recognise the silence of

Congress as to survivorship in 1983 actions.
On the other hand, Congress dis speak explicitly when
it enacted 1988 to provide that when there is such a gap in
the provisions of the Civil Rights Act, a common law as modi-”
fled and changed toy the Constitution and the statutes of the
state or the forum, so far as the same is not inconsistent with
the Constitution and laws of the United States shall be ex­
tended to and govern the cause.

Thus, as the appellate courts

in the Fourth Circuit, in Dean v. Shirer, the Firth in the
Brazier case, the Sixth in Hall v. Wooten, the opinion written
by the present Solicitor General, and the Seventh in Spence
v. Sfcaras, have all recognised that Congress, in enacting
section 1988 of the Civil Rights Act, has adopted the state
law of the forura as the federal law or federal common law of
survivorship of civil rights actions.
Amicus in its brief filed with the Court simply
clouds the issue, we submit, by referring to choice of law
rules, since they only apply when there is no such congres­
sional mandate as section 1988.

This Court so recognized in

the Moor case when, in considering section 1988, it said that
this in Moor is a wholly different case than those in which
lacking any clear expression of congressional will we have

i

s

been called upon to decide -.whether it is appropriate to look
to state law or to fashion a single federal rule in order to
fill the interstices of federal law.
The instant case, wa submit, accordingly involves
statutory interpretation and not choice of law rules.

This

Court should cast aside these false issues which have been
0

injected and follow we submit the clear language of 1988.

The

only qualification which Congress stated in that section was
that the state law not be inconsistent with the Constitution
and laws of the United States.
QUESTIONS

Suppose some state hasn't modified the

common law at all , then that is the end of the matter?
MR. MONROEs

Mr. Justice White, we would submit so,

and —
QUESTION:

And that the common law rule just couldn't

possibly violate this one proviso you just spoke of?
MR. MONROEs

We submit, sir, that under the direct

dictate of Congress in 1988 that that law of the state would
have to be applied since the law is entirely silent as to
survivorship.

There is no rule at all to which the Court can
/

turn to
QUESTION:

And the only common law the statute refers

to is state common law?
MR. MONROEs
QUESTION:

I would say so, Your Honor»
Although I suppose if the state, by

10
judicial decision, changed the comuon law, it would be ac­
ceptable?
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:
MR. MONROE:

That is an interesting —
Do you have state common law in Louisiana?
No, sir.

QUESTION:

I didn’t think so.

QUESTION:

So in Louisiana, would you say that only

the common law rule could apply?
MR. MONROE:

No, sir, as I think you look to the law

of the state as enacted by the constitution and the statutes
of that state.
QUESTION:

Yes, but my Brother White's question was

what if it is not changed by the constitution or statute but
by judicial decision, then what do you do?
MR. MONROE:

I would say, sir, that if that were -the

rule in Louisiana, I would think that under 1988 it would have
to be applied.
QUESTION:

Now, which, the judicial decision or the

— is that it?
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:

Yes, six.
The law of Louisiana, however and by whom­

ever declared?
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:
MR, MONROE:

That's correct, sir.
But that is not what the statute says.
I believe so

11
QUESTION;

What it says as modified and changed by

the constituion and statutes of the state or in the court
having jurisdiction.
MR. MONROE:

Mr. Justice Brennan, I assume, of

course, that we would have the situation, say, in this case
that for whatever reason, the Supreme Court of Louisiana wou3.d
reach a different interpretation of the Civil Code, Article
2315,

that has been the case to date.

I would say then that

if the highest court of the state, in construing or intepreting the law, that it be common law -QUESTION:
MR. MONROE:

Or statute?
— or statute, to say that there is no

hardship whatever -~
QUESTION:

That would be a statutory change for pur­

poses of 1983?
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:

I would say so, sir.
No, that would be the statute as con­

strued by the highest court of the state.
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:

Precisely, sir.
Otherwise you would have one rule in

Louisiana and another rule for the other 49 states, I presume.
MR. MONROE:

Oh, I think that is quite possible,

and I think that is true.

As far as I know, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, I readily concede that as far as I know the sur­
vivorship law

of Louisiana is the only one, the only state in

12

enacting the qualifications to the survivorship rule which
follows the federal pattern which you find throughout the
federal statutes in designating familial beneficiaries who
have that right.

Now, there are some I think 22 states which

have enacted —
QUESTION;

Well, my question was directed more to

this difference between the civil law, which I understand to
obtain in Louisiana, and to depend entirely on cede provisions
and —MR. MONROE;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
-— and the other four United States which

have more or less common law antecedents and the idea of
a seamless web where there is no statute, the common law pre­
sumably governs.
MR. MONROE;

Yes, I understand, sir.

would be -— you would have to look

That certainly

at the statute law of

Louisiana to the same extent.
We submit that although the courts being in agree­
ment that the Civil Rights Act is silent as to survivorship of
1983, and that there is a void in that respect, it runs counter
to all basic tenets of logic to say that for Louisiana law
providing for a limited survivorship is inconsistent with that
Act.

There cannot be any inconsistency with something which

doesn’t exist.
QUESTION;

Would you think that it would be wholly

13
inappropriate to absent 1983 to construe that the statute is
providing for survivorship?
MR. MONROE:

Absent 1988, Mr. Justice White, I think

you would bring into play those doctrines which amicus dis­
cussed at considerable length in its brief about the Rules of
Decision Act and the choice of law which, of course, is being
debated all the time and is causing this Court and other
federal courts considerable problem as to the choice of lav;
and what law to apply.
So I think absent 198C, you would have to — this
Court and other federal courts would have to be guided by those
principles.

Nov;, that, of course, is one of the tenets that

we are holding forth today, that with 1988 that one must follow
the dictate of Congress, and one does not look to the choice
of law rules.
QUESTION:

Of course, 1988 doesn8t speak specific­

ally of survivorship, does it?
MR. MONROE:

No, sir.

All gaps, and I think Congress

was being all-encompassing —•
QUESTION:

Well, do we have to look, for example, to

state law to determine the question of immunity of governmental
officials under 1983?
MR. MONROE:

1983 — excuse me, the question of im­

munity again I think might be analogized —
QUESTION:

It isn’t mentioned in 1983.

14
MR. MONROEs

No* sir, it isn’t, but I think it may be

analogized to my point about recoverable damages.

There you

already have a well-established body of law as to immunity.
There is I think a common law, federal common law.
QUESTION:

That is federal law.

MR. MONROE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, federal law.
Common law.

MR. MONROE:

So therefore you do not have a void or

a gap in the federal law, would be my position.
QUESTION:

You can't read that in 1983.

MR. MONROE:

Yes, sir, I think you can, Mr. Jus-ice

White, because the premise of 1983 -QUESTION:

Well, there are some things that you can

construe in a statute.
MR. MONROE:

No.

1983 starts off by saying in effect

that when -- commands the courts to apply its jurisdiction
under the Civil Rights Act in accordance with the federal law.
QUESTION:
MR. MONROEs
QUESTION:

Well, it says laws.
Laws.
And do you think that includes — laws

generally connotes written statutes.
MR. MONROE:
QUESTION;

Well, that could be -And do you think laws means that it include!

federal common law?
MR. MONROE:

It has been interpreted by this Court

15
I think in the immunity cases, as I recall it —
QUESTION :

I thought we just said that immunity under

1983 was a matter of construing 1983 , was the common lav;?
It is just a matter of statutory construction.
MR. MONROE:

Well, it could be approached from the

matter of construction of the statute.
cases

I think some of the

would indicate to me that they considered that as being

an existing rule of law.
QUESTION:

Pierson v. Ray didn't refer to 1988 at all.

MR. MONROE:

No, sir.

That is my point.

I think

that, rightly or wrongly, I think the courts have gone that way
is my point, sir.
Itfe submit that there is nothing in the legislative
history of the Civil Rights Acts to sueport the proposition
that when Congress enacted section 1986 in

1866 or section 1983

in 1871, that it intended that there should be an absolute
survival of actions under the Civil Rights Acts.

To the con­

trary that the survivorship law of Louisiana is not inconsistent
with the Civil Rights Act we feel is demonstrated by the action
of Congress itself in 1871 in enacting section 1986 when it
rejected a Senate amendment in a subsequent committee version,
both of which included a very broad absolute survivorship of
actions provision.

Instead, 1986, as adopted by Congress,

provided, as explained by Representative Shellabarger, the floor
manager of the bill, for limited survivorship sections under

16

both sections 1986 and section 1985, which are the sections
of the Ku Klux Act specifically aimed at the acts of invidious
discrimination of the Ku Klux Klan which so often resulted
ultimately in death and which was certainly a prime motivation
behind the enactment of the so-called Ku Klux Act in 1871.
If the purpose and policy of Congress were in fact that
regardless of the provisions of state lav; to be applied under
1988, there should be absolute survivorship of actions under
1983.

It seems obvious to petitioner at least that Congress

would have required the same result as to actions under sec­
tions 1985 and 1986.

However, again Representative Shellabarger,

recognising that under common law there is no survivorship of
actions for the deceased person, praised the limited survivor­
ship clause of the amendment which became section 1986 and
advised his colleagues in the House that it operates as to
actions under section 1985, which was section two of the bill,
as well as those under section 1986, which was section three
of the bill.
He went on to explain that that clause was in his
words intended to secure it, that is the right of action, to
the family of the deceased to the exclusion, for example, of
the creditors, just as our statutes do in the case where death
occurs from railroad negligence.
Congress had intended that there be all-encompassing
unlimited survivorship section 1983 actions, as the courts

17
below have held, Congress could simply have so provided ex­
pressly.

It has been asserted that the deterrence objective

of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 requires rejection of the
Louisiana law of limited survivorship.

Here again, it is in­

conceivable to petitioner that any such objective of Congress
was so strong as to permit the federal courts to refuse to
comply with the dictates of 1983 to follox-7 and apply this state
law of survivorship.
When Congress itself adopted 1986, in that section a very
similar limited survivorship of 1985 and 1986 actions, cer­
tainly any objective of deterrence which Congress had in mind
would have been even stronger, we submit, with respect to the
types of invidious class action embraced in those latter sec­
tions of the Act than would be so as to merely the state actiontype of violation prescribed by section 1983.
The same analysis, it seems to us, is also appropriate
with the argument of amicus that Louisiana's survival statute
must be rejected as being inconsistent with the complete
justice theme of the Civil Rights Act.

In fact, not only does

section 1986 restrict survival to certain designated bene­
ficiaries, but unlike the Louisiana statute, it goes further
and the federal Act also limits those beneficiaries to recovery
of only $5,000.

Thus, we submit Louisiana8s statute cannot be

said to be out of tune with the federal complete justice theme.
Moreover, Louisiana's statute is entirely consistent with

IS
every other federal statute which is provided for survivorship.
Thus, whether the injured party is a railroad worker, a seaman,
the lord of the admiralty, a longshoreman-harborworker, or one
killed on the high seas, his action upon death survives only
in favor of certain designated familial beneficiaries, not a
friend remembered in decedent's will as residuary legatee.
Congress has accordingly directed, we submit, a course of
action to be followed by the federal courts in this action,
and that is fill the interstices of the federal statute with
the state law of survivorship, adopt as federal law or federal
common law, if one will, the Louisiana law of survivorship.
Congress having spoken as it did in section 1988 with respect
to adoption of state law, but having been otherwise entirely
silent as to survivorship of section 1983 actions, the view of
this Court in Alyeska as to award of attorneys fees in a civil
rights action is appropriate here.

That is, the Civil Rights

Acts do not contain the necessary congressional authorization
for the courts to formulate a federal common law of absolute
surv Ivor ship.
As this Court said in Chevron Oil v. Huson, interpreting a
provision in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, very similar
to section 1988, Congress made clear provision for filling in
the gaps in federal law.

They did not intend that federal

e

courts fill in those gaps by creating new federal common law.
The several arguments advanced by the respondent amicus as

19
well as by the courts below as to the need for uniform and
absolute survivorship of civil rights actions are policy matters,
we submit, which are properly addressed to Congress.

It is

respectfully submitted that the law of Louisiana as to survivor­
ship of actions should have been followed and applied by the
courts below to this action pursuant to section 1988 of the
Civil Rights Act, and that since plaintiff left none of the
designated familial beneficiaries in whom this action could
survive, this action should be dismissed.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wegmann.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD F. WEGMANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WEGMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to say at the outset in response to Mr,
Justice Rehnquist's question with respect to the fact that
Louisiana has the civil law and not the common law, and the
adoption by the courts of the state law if the state law is
hospitable to the plaintiff's action, that it is no consequence
that we deal with Louisiana Civil Code and that Article 2315
of the Code is our survival statute.
All concerned agree that if you are going to interpret
1988 to mean that the state law must be applied, the statute
that would be applied would be Article 2315 of the Civil Code,

20
and the action of the plaintiff would abate.
Very briefly stated, our position with respect to the
application of the state law is that the state law applies
solely and only if through the application of the state law
the action will be allowed to survive, that any inhospitable
state statute or state survivor statute is not to be applied
because of the very simple fact that the trend and the theory
of the civil rights laws is for the actions to continue despite
the fact of the death of the plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Then you are not arguing based on 1988,

because I don’t see anything there about trend or hospitable
or that type of language?
MR. WEGMANN:

Well, I don’t think I have any doubt

but to argue on the basis of 1988.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought that in 1988, if you will

look at your own brief on page 6, the language of the statute,
that it says in effect "the common law, as modified and changed
by the Constitution and statutes of the state wherein the court
having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held, so
far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and
laws of the United States, shall be" applied.

Don’t you have

to show that the Louisiana statute is inconsistent either xv'ith
the Constitution of the United States or with a law of the
United States?
MR. WEGMANN:

Yes, sir, I agree with that, and this

21
is exactly what Judge Wisdom d id , Judge Wisdom of the Fifth
Circuit did in affirming the decision of the trial court.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be a matter of opinion as

to whether he did it or not.
MR. WEGMANN:

How would you do it?

I would do it in exactly the same

fashion.
QUESTION:

But it is inconsistent with 1983?*

MR. WEGMANN:

Yes, sir, because you will find that

all of the circuits which have considered this question have
applied the state law solely and only because that state law
was hospitable to the action and allowed the action to continue.
This is the only case which I have been able to locate in which
the state law is inhospitable to the continuance of the
plaintiff's claim, as a result of which the Fifth Circuit did

not apply the Louisiana law.
QUESTION:

How about a statute of limitations?

MR. WEGMANN:

They had one instance, I think it was

the Lefton case, in which the state statute of limitations was
ten days and the court refused to apply the state statute be™
cause they said that it was ridiculous, it was not anybody's
intention to deprive a citizen of their rights to a ten-day
statute of limitations.
QUESTION:

But you have had other cases in which more

normal statutes of limitations have been applied, haven't you?
MR. WEGMANN:

The more normal statutes of limitations

22
would be one,, two, and perhaps four years, and they do vary
from state to state.
QUESTION:

And haven't those been applied under 1938?

MR. WEGMANN:

We don't here have a question of the

statute of limitations.
QUESTION:

But why is survival different than the

statute of limitations if you are going to turn your argument
on 1988?
MR. WEGMANN:

Well, the statute of limitations doesn't

enter into this case because this case was filed before Shaw
died.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wegraann —

MR. WEGMANN:

We don't have to contend with the

statute of limitations.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wegraann, getting back to the argument,

had there been familial descendants, the Louisiana statute
would not have been inhospitable, would it?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

Mo, sir, it would not have been,

So you are saying the statute is inhos­

pitable because of the facts of the particular case?
MR. WEGMANN:

Yes, we can say that, and it is hos­

pitable because Shaw did not leave -- Shaw was not married.
Is he to be penalised because he didn't marry?

Is he to be

penalized because his parents died before him?
QUESTION;

The statute didn't prevent him from getting

23
married and didn’t prevent him from leaving heirs.

I mean the

statute is inhospitable, to use your language, solely because
there were no heirs.
MR. WEGMANN:

There were heirs.

He died testate.

But

there were no familial descendants, ascendents or collateral as
applied by Article 2315.
QUESTION:

Well, you understand what I am talking

about and that is the reason —
MR. WEGMANNs
collaterals.

He did have a family.

He did have some

He had some nephews and nieces who survived.

QUESTION:

So the reason the statute is in trouble is

because of him?
MR. WEGMANN:

If I might finish, sir, if he had not

died testate but had died intestate, there were collaterals who
were there to inherit the action.
QUESTION:

But that is not before us, is it?

MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, but you are asking me about --

All I am saying is you are saying it is

because the peculiar facts of this case, this statute is un­
cons titutiona1.
MR. WEGMANN:

I don't say that the statute is uncon­

QUESTION:

Well, what do you say?

You say it doesn't

you.
ME., WEGMANN:

I say it does not bar me from continuing.

24
QUESTION:

And if it doesn't bar you , then by what

right do you continue?
MR. WEGMANN:

I continue because wearing my hat as

executor of Clay Shaw's succession, I have been allowed by the
trial court to substitute myself as the plaintiff in this damage
suit.

And the trial court, in a very well-reasoned opinion,

affirmed by a second well-reasoned opinion, with no emotion in
it, despite the remarks of petitioner to that effect, has held
that because

Article 2315 of the Louisiana Code is inhos­

pitable to the application of state lav/, that it doesn’t apply,
and we bring into play the federal common law which Mr. Justice
Stewart spoke of, and the Appellate Court in its opinion made
the direct pronouncement to the effect that the federal common
law is alive and well, and it is the federal common law which
was applied both by the trial court as well as by the Appellate
Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wegmann, on your theory that if he had

left his entire estate to Ford Foundation, let us say, your
legal position would be the same, would it not?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it v/ould.

But are not survivorship concepts generally,

although not strictly, but generally based on some traceable
connection between the decedent and -MR. WEGMANN:

And the survivors, yes.

QUESTION:

that is true in FELA and the others?

25
MR. WEGMANN:

The ship's statutes, as a rexilef are

for the protection and the taking care of the decendents or the
dependents of the individual who may have been injured or killed
by virtue of the negligence of some third party.
that is the case.

Ordinarily

But as I said before, if Shaw had died

intestate, there are nieces and nephews surviving him.
were beneficiaries in his will.

They

But it so happens, as is so

often the case in life, his closest friend was closer to him
than those collaterals, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews, so
he left his good friend, named his good friend as the residuary
legatee, which is our Louisiana term, of his succession* one
of the assets of which is this cause of action.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wegmann, following up on the Chief

Justice's question, supposing he had left the will he did leave
and had also been survived by a son, and in his will he said "I
don't want my son to have any benefit from my estate," under
your theory of the case, who would own the cause of action?
MR. WEGMANN:

Well, your hypothetical is a little bit

difficult to answer, Mr. Justice Stevens, because of the fact
that in Louisiana we have what is known as the law of forced
heirship, and I can only disinherit my descendants for the
specific reasons which are enunciated in the code in succession
of procedure
QUESTION:

Well, say you had those reasons available?

MR. WEGMANN:

— and it is next to impossible.

26
QUESTION:

Well,

it is theoretically possible,

isn’t it?
MB.. WEGMANN:

Theoretically, yes, from a practical

standpoint.
QUESTION:

Now, which law would prevail, the federal

common law that I take it you say gives the right to the
estate or the Louisiana statute that says it goes to the son?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

Isn't that the kind of question —-

MR. WEGMANN:
tion.

I don’t know that I —

I don't know if I understand your ques­

You are saying assume that he had a son and he disin­

herited that son.
QUESTION:

Or maybe he just said in the will, I want

this cause of action to be prosecuted by my estate, not for the
benefit of my son but for the benefit of my collateral heirs.
Under federal common law, would that wish prevail?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

Even though under Louisiana law there was

a son available who could claim under 1988?
MR. WEGMANN:

Yes, assuming that he did comply with

the requirements of the code in the disinheritance of the son.
I have to make that assumption because we do have our law of
forced heirship which we are very proud of and which is very
difficult to avoid.
QUESTION:

The reason I asked the question, maybe that

27
is an improbable hypothetical, but if we accept your theory
of the case and there are

I suppose there will be possibili­

ties of conflict between the federal rule as to who should get
the surviving cause of action and the state law.

I mean a

state law might provide, as I say, the son gets the claim and
under your theory, as I understand it, it goes to the estate.
MR. WEGMANN:

Yes, because he died testate, and using

your hypothetical he said I want this claim to be prosecuted
by my executor for the benefit of my residuary legatee.
QUESTION;

And there is some kind of a federal basis

for doing this?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION;

Well —

For giving preference to the estate over

the person that the Louisiana statute says should have the case?
MR. WEGMANN:

I think we are on a tangent because we

are dealing
QUESTION:

Well, I am just trying to figure out what

kind of questions are around the corner if we accept your
theory of the case.

This is not the only case in which a

plaintiff of a 1983 action is going to die, certainly.
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

I am quite aware of that.

Does your theory of forced heirship apply

where only a parent survives?
MR. WEGMANN;
heir.

Yes, sir, if the ascendent is a forced

28

QUESTION:

And the same, «also if there is only a

brother?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

Sir?

If I recall, your statute —

MR. WEGMANN:

Collaterals are not forced heirs, no.

Forced heirs are ascendents and decendents.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose then a sibling survived?

MR. WEGMANN;

A forced heir.

QUESTION:

A forced heir.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wegmann, not that it applies to your

case, xihat do you call an administrator of a will in Louisiana?
It is a funny name.
MR. WEGMANN:

We call it a succession.

estate.

We call it

We do not refer to it as an

We do not have a final decree as you have in the

common law states.

We have what is known as a judgment of

possession, recognizing the heirs as such and placing and
putting them in the possession of the decedent's succession.
QUESTION:

Immediately?

MR. WEGMANN:

Sometimes immediately, sometimes after

administration, depending upon the size of the succession and
the involvements in it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wegmann, the Chief Justice asked you

whether your position would be the same if the estate had been
left to the Ford Foundation and your answer was in the

29
affirmative.

I suppose it would be the same also if the entire

estate had been left to the Ku Klux Klan?
MR. X^iEGMANN:

I'm afraid it would have been.

It would

be, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

I think it would have to be.

MR. XvEGMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I have to be consistent.

Yes.

MR. XvEGMANN:

It is of no consequence who the

residuary legatee of the estate is or of the succession.
QUESTION:

TVould not precisely be compatible with —

MR. XvEGMANN:

To make it even worse, Mr. Justice

Powell, supposing by some strange whim of fate he had left —
he had named the very nefarious Mr. Jim Garrison as his
residuary legatee, my position would have to be the same.
QUESTION:

Probably the plaintiff would have dismissed

the lawsuit though.
MR. XVEGMANN:

I’m afraid so.

This plaintiff would

have.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wegmann, let me go back to Mr. Justice

Rehnquist's question about statutes of limitation.

Now, I

understand there is no limitations issue in this case, but
your theory, as I understand it, is that you do not look to
state law if the state law does not facilitate recovery.

Now,

sometimes
MR. WEGMANN:

I was asked that question repeatedly in

30

the Circuit Court when I argued this case, and one of the
justices could not, just simply couldn't believe what my
response was, because I think it is just that simple, and it
is a simple proposition, as is stated by Professor Theis, in
this Louisiana Law Review article which I cited to you, that
if the state law allows the action to survive, it is hospit­
able and the state law is applicable.

If a state law abates

the action, it is inhospitable and it does not apply.
QUESTION:

But would you respond in terns of the

statute of limitations.

If an action is brought, say, five

years after it had accrued, and thare is a four-year state
statute of limitations in the state, now that would tend to
defeat the claim and under 1988 I had thought we would then
look at the state law to see if that statute of limitations
applied.

Would you agree that we look at the state law in

that circumstance, or would you say no because it is not
hospitable?
MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

You would look at it?

MR. WEGMANN:
QUESTION:

I'm sure you would.

Yes, sir.

Well, why do we look at state law in

limitation situations but not in abatement situations, that
is what I don't understand?
MR. WEGMANN:

I can only give you what I have read

of the cases, and apparently the reasoning is that where the

31

statute of limitations of the state is for a reasonable period
of time, in Louisiana it is one year, in Mississippi I believe
it is two years, as I recall over in Georgia it is four years-QUESTION:

Then v;'hy don't we apply the same test in

abatement?
MR. WEGMANN:

— which is reasonable periods of time

for —QUESTION:

Then why don't we apply the same test in

abatement and say is the state statute dealing with survivor­
ship a reasonable statute, if it is something that says no
civil rights action shall ever survive, we obviously wouldn't
look to it?
MR. WEGMANN:

I think I could best give you the

Appellate Court's reasoning in that regard, and that was Judge
Wisdom established a three-step procedure which he said we
should follow.

He said is the Civil Rights Act deficient in

furnishing a remedy for vindication?

That is the first step.

He said then if the Act is deficient, we look to state law.
He then said if state law is available, we must insure that
state law is not inconsistent with federal and Constitutional
law.

Taking that three-step procedure, he held that there was

a gap because the statute doesn't provide for survival, a
survival line.

He said that it is deficient and we look then

to the state law, but he said the state law is inconsistent
because the theory of Congress in enacting the Civil Rights Acts

32

was to see to it that the federally guaranteed rights of the
citizen were protected.
QUESTION;

Is the same reasoning applicable to my

four-year statute of limitations?
MR. WEGMANN;

Precisely.

Well, as I say, I can only refer you to

the Lefton case in which the statute of limitations was ten
days and the court said -QUESTION;

Well, but it has to be reasonable and

neutral, we assume that.
MR. WEGMANN;
QUESTION:

I'm injecting the reasonable in there.

But why doesn't your argument also say we

won’t apply a four-year statute of limitations?
follow your reasoning.
MR. WEGMANN:

I just don’t

Maybe I’m missing something.
Because the courts have said that we

want this civil rights claim to go forward.

I had this same

problem, I didn't enjoin Garrison once, I sought to enjoin him
twice.

I sought to enjoin Garrison prior to the first trial.

I was faced with Dombrowski.

Dombrowski, this Court said,

applied only to the protection of my First Amendment rights.
The trial court, in granting my temporary restraining order,
adopted my argument.

If the central government was here to

protect my First Amendment rights, why wasn't it here to pro­
tect all of my federally guaranteed rights?
tion request was flatly denied.

My first injunc­

We went to trial.

But then

when this malicious District Attorney carae along subsequent to

33

the trial of the case, we had a forty-day trial, we had a
unanimous twelve-man verdict of aquittal within less than an
hour after a forty-day trial.

On the very next working day.

Garrison himself goes in and files a bill of information
against Shaw charging that he committed perjury

when he took

the witness stand to defend himself and testified that he did
not know, had never seen nor was he ever acquainted with
Oswald.

The state court refused to suppress, refused to dis­

miss.

I went into federal court and sought to gain an injunc­

tion.

Fortunately, by this time, we had Younger v. Harris

and Perez v. Ladezma, and I was able to convince the trial
court that I had those special circumstances which would enable
that court to enjoin that second state court criminal proceed­
ing, and the judgment in that trial court in that second in­
junction suit was maintained again by the Fifth Circuit, and
this Court refused writs.
This is not the first time the Shaw case has been
before this Court.

After the first injunction suit was filed

and denied, I filed a very substantial jurisdictional state­
ment seeking relief from this Court.

I have been fighting

this thing since March 1, 1967, and I say to this Court that,
despite counsel's statements to the contrary, sure there is
emotion, this man’s federally guaranteed
maliciously violated.

rights were

This Bian was used as nothing more than

a conduit to an adversary proceeding for the trial of the

34

Warren Commission report.
QUESTION;

Even if v;e accept all that as totally

true, it doesn't really reach the fundamental question in this
case, does it?
MR. WEGMANN;

Yes, sir, it reaches it for the reason

that the intent of Congress and the intent of the courts is to
prevent people like Garrison from misusing his public office,
to stop conduct which is mere similar to what we might term a
police state than a democracy, and to protect those rights to
the fullest extent, even after the death of a plaintiff.
QUESTION;

The voters of Louisiana have done some­

thing about that already, haven't they?
MR. WEGMANN;

Fortunately, and they are going to have

an opportunity to do something about it again, because now he
is running for the bench ard, God willing, he will be defeated
as he was the last time he ran for the bench.
Now, I had a lovely argument outlined here for you
but I think that I have given you my position actually in a —
oh, let me say one more thing.

Counsel for the petitioner

made mention of the fact that the findings of fact in the in­
junction suit, where the court specifically found that Shaw’s
constitutional rights had been violated were not binding upon
the defendants in this civil proceeding.

Well, I am not here

asserting that those findings are binding upon these defendants
at this time.

I am here telling the Court that, in addition to

35
the fact that you must take my complaint for the purposes of
this appeal as being factually accurate in every respect, you
have another basis for taking it as factually accurate and
taking as a statement of fact the fact that Shaw's federally
guaranteed rights were violated because it has been judicially
adjudicated that such is the fact.
it is a simple procedure.

And I submit to you that

We can theorize, we can analyze, we

If the state statute allows the action to sur­

vive, the state statute is applied, and this is what the
several circuits which have considered the question have done.
The Seventh Circuit did it recently in Byrd v.
Johnson, decided in December ’77.

If the state statute is in­

hospitable, it does not apply, and we use this federal common
law which is alive and well, and I submit to you —
QUESTION:

And this Court of Appeals is the only one

to have applied that second doctrine, isn’t it?
MR. WEGMANN:

So far as I know, yes, sir, finding

that the state law was inhospitable and hence refused to apply
the state law, and instead applied the federal common lav/.

further, Mr. Monroe?
MR. MONROE:
