ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT F. MOORE,

EEQ.,

ON BRJ-IAIJ? OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOORE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is bock on a remand.
year ago, I guess.

We were here about a

The case concerns the constitutionality of

a New Jersey statute that is known as Public Lavj 1973.* Chapter
363.

And we are weighing this statute against the — its valid­

ity under the Commerce Clause as well as-under the Supremacy
Clause.
I will try to divide my time as equally as- possible,
so I can cover both of the very important subjects and would like
reserve five minutes also for rebuttal.
The statute in New Jersey bans the disposal of solid
waste that originated out of New Jersey — in New Jersey,
is the first section of the statute.

-That

The second section is also

a very small paragraph and that bans the transportation of solid
waste from — that originated out of New Jersey -- into and•: through

•Now, the first question, of course, that we' have to he
faced, v.gifcb in considering a Ctvaejree Clause situation is: Is the

4
subject matter and the activity legitimate in interstate commerce
so that the Commerce Clause would even apply,

Here, we are deal­

ing with a subject matter that is very broad by definition of
the New Jersey statute. It covers every type of conceivable waste,
both solid and liquid.

We should not fix in our minds rubbish

or garbage, as such, being the sole object of the statute be­
cause it is not.

This covers automobile hulks, which this Court

recognized in the Hughes v. Alexandria Motor case not so long
ago as being a legitimate item in interstate commerce.
cludes demolition material.

It in­

It includes the scraps from industry

in commerce and hotels and restaurants, as well as, of course,
residential scraps.
Then,

in addition to the subject matter which we con­

tend is legitimate because there are two industries that depend
upon this subject matter for their economic survival.

One is the

collection industry or the transporters of this waste and the
other is the disposers of the waste which are basically, in New
Jersey, the solid waste landfill, sanitary landfill operators,
QUESTION:

Would the existence of these companies in

that kind of business alone give them any special status. Suppose,
for example, instead of taking it over to New Jersey, they de­
cided to haul it out to sea a little distance and drop It; would
there be a barrier to enforcing restraints against that for en­
vironmental purposes?

kR* Mu0RE:

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor, because

5
we are net arguing here that New Jersey does not 'have the right
to deal evenhnndedly in protecting its environment and the health
that they definitely do.

The question is are they dealing in an

evenhanded, nondiscriminatory fashion in doing this?
The State' has admitted- that there is no qualitative
difference between waste originating in another State and waste
originating in New Jersey,

And, as 1 develop my argument, I will
actually, this is a faco.de;

there is

no environmental harm, no degradation to the environment in a
properly regulated and operated sanitary landfill.

And that has

been recognised by the Congress as .well as in New -Jersey.
And so, I do not believe in an; ‘ way the'
fact that the item in commerce may be of value to only a very
few people -detracts -from* Its legitimacy -"a's an litres .of'"’'

Now, what is it that the disposers, the sanitary land fill operators do?

What function do they perform?

They are selling, really, a product, in a

sense.

They are

They are selling space in a sanitary landfill for the

permanent interment- of solid waste.

It is very much similar-

to a warehouseman selling space on.a short-term basis.

He is

not particularly concerned with the intrinsic value of the item
that he rents space for.

And, likewise, the sanitary landfill

operator, other than the requirements of meeting the envi
'standards, is- not concerned with the intrinsic worth of the

But he is performing a function of

And he is selling space.

QUESTION:

Is it kind of like a cemetery?

MR, MOORE:

Yes* I was going to mention that and it is

exactly what it is like.

QUESTION:

Is that the way it always worked* that the

owner of the land is the seller and the depositor of the refuse
is the buyer?

What if a person has land that he wants filled*

it is to his advantage to have it filled; does he ever pay to
have somebody dump on his land?
MR. MOORE:

Well*, in New Jersey* it is so strictly

regulated* nobody can have land filled* unless they have regis­

And the environmental controls that the

State exacts are extremely high and extremely expensive to in­
stall.

And that, in itself, supports a lot of peripheral indus­

tries that supply the environmental machines, mechanics and things
like that, your tremendously heavy compactor units and bulldozers,
etcetera, that go into operating the sanitary landfills.
Now, the Federal courts in United States v, Pennsylvania
Refuse Haulers, has recognized, for the purposes of the Sherman
Antitrust Act, transportation and disposal of waste to be a
legitimate subject of interstate commerce.
The Congress in the House Report on the Resource
Conservation Recovery Act, Report Number 94-1491, at several
sections in their Committee Report, but I'll just read one of
them, on page 9, sc .ccs thac

have at some time entered the flow of interstate commerce, if
not as waste itself, then in the form of products which will, at
some future time, constitute waste.
The fact that waste, itself, is in interstate and inter­
municipal commerce has raised a number of problems,

Several

jurisdictions, including seme States., have attempted to prohibit
the importation of waste.

So it has been recognized by Congress,

it lias been recognized by the Federal courts and it is recognised
by New Jersey that the transportation and disposal are legitimate
businesses.
Jersey.

They are engaged in Intrastate commerce in New

They are public utilities in New Jersey, the collectors

and the disposers.
Now, under the Commerce Clause, of course, the test
as to whether a State statute can legitimately co-exist in this
field and regulate commerce

there,has to meet certain tests and

standards which this Court has developed over the years that are
recited In Pike v, 3ru.ee Church and many of the others, the Great
Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. y. Cottrell, and all the way down.
And, basically, it is that the State statute must deal in an
evenhanded, nondiscriminatory manner, it must serve a legitimate
local purpose and not be a burden on interstate commerce, At
least, it must not be an excessive burden.

If it turns out to be

somewhat of a burden, then, of course, we go into the balancing
of the national interest against the local interest.
The New Jersey statute discriminates, in that New Jersey

9
says — and they have stated this

The Acting Governor when the

bill was enacted made this statement, "that we are wont to pre­
serve this as a natural resource" -« meaning the sanitary land­
fills *— "for the benefits of the residents of the State of New
Jersey,"
They are; in effect; hoarding a resource.

It’s very

much like the natural gas cases .in which that was attempted as a
conservation measure by those States, to hoard the natural gas
for the benefit of the citizens of those States.

And this Court

struck that down,
QUESTION:

Would you say that a one-acre zoning limi­

tation enacted by a town in New Jersey or, perhaps, a five-acre
zoning limitation for a single-family dwelling, was a hoarding of
natural resource as to Levitt who wanted to build on quarteracre lots?
MR, MOORE:
sense, yes.

It could be, I think, stretched into that

But in Mew Jersey the sanitary landfill locations

are also controlled by local zoning,
QUESTION:

But would you say that any State regulation

which required more space to be used or prevented space to be
used that an oufc-of-State developer wanted to use was a hoarding
of a natural resource, and thereby violated the Commerce Clause?
MR, MOORE:

Well, you get to the point of are you taking

private property from someone?

Remember these are not -- the

fact that they are public utilities --- they are privately owned.

10

They are not operated by the State and very rarely by munici­
palities and very rarely by counties.
in New Jersey are privately owned.

The bulk of the landfills

And you get to a point

'Whether hoarding or reserving a natural resource becomes a taking,

QUESTION:

Yes.

reached in my hypothetical.

Let’s assume that point hasn't been
So that your only complaint is the

Commerce Clause,
MR, MOORE:
QUESTION:

Well,» then I don't quite get your question.
Well* you say that a state may not, quote*

'hoard*," close quote* its natural resources* and I am asking you
if a zoning ordinance which* as applied to someone who wants to
build houses on quarter-acre lots insists that the minimum re­
quirement is a five-acre lot, is guilty of hoarding?
MR, MOORE:

No.

I do not think that's guilty of

hoarding at all* because you have a Due Process Clause coming
\

\

in to protect that type of situation.

As long as the regulation

is reasonable and deals with the subject matter in an evenhanded fashion and is not arbitrary or capricious then It's not
a hoarding type of limitation.
Also* this New Jersey statute in discrimination* it
says to the operators of landfills in New Jersey, "You

,

may sell your space in an unlimited way to anybody who is in
New Jersey whose waste originated in New Jersey* but you cannot
sell any space* whatsoever, to someone, a business outside of

11

Nei Jersey whose waste originates outside of the State of New
Jersey."
Now, I think that is a very blatant example of the
dis c riminafcion.
Now, the health and environment aspects, the findings
of the New Jersey Legislature at the beginning of this statute,
indicates that they arc leaning on health and environment to
justify this incursion of the.‘Commerce Clause by the State' of
New Jersey.

And, just briefly, the State, itself — Grant Walton'

who, when he was Director of the Division of Environments1
Quality of the Department of Environmental -Protection of the
btate of New Jersey, in a published talk that he gave which is
also in our brief on page 9; he stated that "the health hazard.,
water and air pollution methane gas problems,commonly associated
u.i.ch landfills can be eliminated through proper design and opera­
tion of the facility,

Properly done,abandoned surface mines

become parks, playgrounds and golf courses, "
iui.s is ti e head cl that department in New Jersev
uujo,

himseli, recognized that New Jersey standards were suf-

iicientiy high that there v/as no threat to the environment, no
threat to ch*j health of the public in the operation of a sani­
tary land fill.
The New Jersey Supreme Court, in its opinion, in this
case, gave judicial notice to the New Jersey solid waste manageraent plan.

And that pirn states that there is no technological

12
reason why we cannot dispose of solid waste with a minimal of
environmental ham -~
QUESTION:
MR, MOORE:

But under whose control?
Under the .state's control.

Absolutely

under the state's control,
And went on to say that the regulations in New
Jersey with which to regulate and insure a nuisance-free operation
and disposal site in conformance with good practices and health
standards.
Interestingly, the hoiid Waste Management Act -- If I
may just pause here for a moment ~~ The Act that we are weighing
here is called Waste Control Act.
tory piece of legislation.

And that is just a prohibi­

New Jersey also has another Act

called the .solid Waste Management Act which is not before this
Court* but that is the piece of legislation that is very broad
and very pervasive and it has to do with the regulation of
sanitary landfills and any type of waste disposal and transporta­
tion.

When that statute was originally enacted around 1970* they

used the word

"crisis*" and they said that New Jersey was facing

a crisis because of the manner in which landfills were being
operated.

When they amended that statute here about a year ago*

they left the word "crisis" out.

do* apparently* the New Jersey

Legislature* itself* does not recognize today that there is a
crisis as there was several years ago* at least they thought
there was at that time.

13

Now, the Resource Conservetior) -and Recovery Act,again,
in the Committee Repel* t to start with, has recognized that dis­
posal of solid waste at a sanitary landfill is net a threat to
the environment or the health.

It stated that the legislative

standard — this is on page 37 of the report —"the legislative
standard for the Administrator to determine a sanitary landfill
is a disposal site of which there is no reasonable chance of
adverse effects on health and the environment from the disposal
of discarded material."
This, in the definition in 42 U.S.C. 6944 of the
Resource Conservation Recovery Act. Congress has stated, in de­
fining a sanitary landfill, that there is no reasonable probability
of adverse effect on health and environment from disposal of
solitary waste at such a facility, meaning a sanitary landfill.
Now, I noticed in reading a case' that was decided here
.last week, Ray, v. Atlantic Richfield, an interesting; comparison
there.

There the Court said, in dealing with the oil tankers in

Puget Sound, "The Supremacy Clause dictates that the Federal
judgment that a vessel was safe to navigate U.S. waters prevails
over a contrary State judgment."
Mow, in the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, there
is a .Federal judgment.

The Federal judgment is that these land­

fills can be operated safely with no threat to the environment
of the public health.

Now, it seems to me, with that same line

of reasoning then, it must follow that there is no reasonable

14

probability of adverse effect on the public health.

And this

must pre-jail over a contrary State judgment.
Now, the local interest that is being served

lieve we must discount health and environment because I thinic
even though -- let me just stop a moment -- we all recognize that
there are problems associated with the improper handling and
treatment and disposal of solid waste.
about that.
briefs.

There is no question

And we’ve gone into that in great detail in our

These problems are absolutely controllable, as has been

recognized by the Congress of the United states.

It has been

recognized by the Department of Environmental Protection, actually,
of the State of New Jersey.
So, thp local benefit really is an economic benefit.
And this has been stated.

Vi hen Acting Govenor Bealson signed

this first statute into law --Governor Cahill was away — he
made a public statement that :!This is going to preserve for New
\

Jersey residents these landfill areas for their use because
there is tremendous cost involved in hauling waste long dis­
tances."

And that really is what it boils down to.

New Jersey

wants to gain the advantage of having these sanitary landfills
kept to New Jersey only for their use, so that industry and
private people will not be subjected to the expense of hauling
greater distances.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, I suppose it might be

reasonably said that Pennsylvania wants to make use of the nearby

15

space of New Jersey rather than using the much greater land area
which Pennsylvania has,, because of the cost..

What's the compari

son of the size of the two States, roughly?

What's the compari­

son?

Pennsylvania is twice as big, three times ,as big?
MR. MOORE:

At 'least.

New York is the same thing.

Pennsylvania -- and, of courses

It is an economic situation.

Philadelphia is facing today a 'tremendous disaster, should New
Jersey statutes become operative.

They just have not been able

to develop a location at which it is economically feasible and
socially feasible to transport this waste in the huge large
quantities and volumes that is generated there.
QUESTION:

Well, what you are saying and perhaps it

could be suggested that Philadelphia and other places in
Pennsylvania want to use New Jersey space because it is more
expensive to use Pennsylvania *s own space when there is a com­
petition, ultimately, for the finite amount of space available.
MR. MOORE:

This.same thing, Mr. Chief Justice, is

happening in New Jersey today with large segments of the chemica:
industry.

There is no place in New Jersey for this industry to

dispose of its solid waste.

We have several affidavits from the

leading companies that are household words in the United States,
that they must transport their wastes out of New Jersey and into
Pennsylvania,
And if this statute were ever to become operative, as
we know, Pennsylvania has a retaliatory piece of legislation

16
and New Jersey would be forever barred from disposing of its
wastes -•»
QUESTION:

i

You don't have any more favorable Seacaucus

areas, do you?
MR. MOORE:

No, that's pretty much been closed up*

That used to be — and I think what gave rise really to a*lofc
of this, because that was really a mess up there for many, many
yea rs,
QUESTION:

Why, as a matter of economic fact, does

Philadelphia want to go to New Jersey and New Jersey companies
want to go to Philadelphia, in a kind of a high-cost operation
like this?

Why wouldn't you pick the place nearest at hand?
MR. MOORE:

New Jersey does not go to Philadelphia.

They go to other sections of Pennsylvania,
of New Jersey.

The northwest border

They are not going to Philadelphia.

QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't Philadelphia find places

in Pennsylvania?
MR. MOORE:

The problems attending that are -- they

are trying to develop a rail-haul project which has received a
lot of newspaper notoriety to fill the strip mines in Western
Pennsylvania, and there are a lot of technological problems in
that operation which they are trying to work out.

And we have

affidavits in the Appendix that explain all that.

But the con­

figuration of Philadelphia, if you look on a map, is such that
vest of Philadelphia is heavily populated.

You have tremendous

traffic problems In moving any type of vehicle,

New Jersey

right across the river,and there are several bridges, is rela­
tively farmland and rural.

It has always been traditionally a

natural waste shed for the Delaware Valley area, both New Jersey
and Philadelphia.
Incidentally, this morning — to give you an example
of what we are talking about -- a very interesting thing happened
on the way to Court,

he were in traffic and in front of us was

stalled a garbage truck.

And we were held up for a while and

the thought occurred to me -- it brought back to mind a conversa­
tion I had at the EPA a while back when we were discussing this
statute.

There are no landfills in the District of Columbia,

The District of Columbia depends entirely upon Virginia and they
depend upon the State of Maryland,

Now, what would happen if

Maryland and Virginia enacted a statute like New Jersey.

You

know, you would be over this roof in solid waste in the District
of Columbia,
I want to just close quickly so I can pass a little
bit onto the other aspect of the Supremacy Clause, because I see
my time is getting short here.
There are many ncndiscriminatory alternatives that
New Jersey has available to it to accomplish -» if we say the
legitimate local purpose is the preservation of land, a natural
resource.

There are many nondiscriminatory alternatives, none

of which they've ever mentioned.

They could require by

18

legislation heavier and improved compaction equipment to reduce
the volume of waste.

They could require all sanitary landfills

to install shredding equipment which shreds the waste so that it
can. be compacted greater and reduce the volume.

Maryland did.
QUESTION:

How about the people who are importing this stuff

Into New Jersey?

Why can't they take some of these steps?

MR, MOORE:

It's New Jersey that wants to ban It.

And, as I understand the Commerce Clause, New Jersey must deal
in an evanhanded fashion in accomplishing this.

Now, I suppose,

QUESTION:

MR, MOORE:

Yes, sir.

And that's why I pointed out

what was said by Congress, by the State of New Jersey in recog­
nizing it as commerce, by the auto hulk situation which is a part
of solid waste under definition in New Jersey.

Mr, Moore, could New Jersey, constitutionally,

producers would be equally affected.

Would that be Constitu­

MR * MOORS:

If they did it in an evenhanded fashion,

I would say that it would be.

It is Interesting to note also

that New Jersey talks about running out of landfill space.

New

Jersey, to this day, and we have affidavits to this effect that
have never been countered, has yet to this da;y made a survey of
the State of New Jersey to determine what type of acreage is
available to it and to the users for solid waste disposal.

I think it is a case, actually,

of first impression for this Court in the sense that I don’t
recall reading a helping hand or carrot and stick type of Federal
legislation, wherein you were presented with the problem:

Can

that type of Federal legislation preempt a state statute?
The New Jersey State statute we are talking about is
both prohibitory and discriminatory.

Most of the

as I break

down the Supremacy Clause cases, they dealt with primarily State
statutes that were regulatory in nature, as opposed to a Federal
piece of regulation, or prohibitory and a couple of them were
both prohibitory and discriminatory.

was that type case.

Again, another whole

So the prevailing mode of dis»

posal of household and commercial waste in this country today Is
landfilling, not the exclusive one.

There is some incineration.

I think there is still a limited amount of dumping into the ocean.
But each one of those creates environmental and health risks.
I’d like to briefly go through what those environmental
and health risks are with respect to landfilling.
One of the primary effects of landfilling is the
creation of leachate.

As all of the various products go into

the landfill, water also comes in, either by rain or by tidal
flow or one other way, And when the landfill becomes saturated
it starts to produce this highly polluted liquid called leachate
which can run off into both ground water and into surface waters,
and ultimately can pollute the water which we use for drinking.
So there is very substantial environmental danger from the
leachate produced by landfills.
A second environmental danger from landfills is the
creation of methane gas.

It is quite common in landfills, and

even those where they are using modern techniques of landfilling,
for gasses to get produced in sufficient concentrations under
the ground, for fires to break out as a result of a concentration
of methane gas,
QUESTION:

Mr, Skillman, what, ordinarily, is the

24

number of acres taken by a typical landfill?
MR, SKILLMAN:

They run a full gamut.

You may have

small municipal landfills that take just the waste from an in­
dividual municipality, that may be just five-ten acres.
QUESTION:

And they vary in depth, do they?

MR, SKILLMAN:

QUESTION:

Yes.

And yet I gather what you are telling us

about leachate is common to all landfills whatever size, is
that right?
MR. SKILLMAN:
State of New Jersey,

It is common to all landfills in the

Whether or not there are landfill locations

in some of the more arrld Western States where it is possible to
avoid that problem, I don't know.

But no one has pointed out

to us any landfill location in the State of New Jersey where
this isn't a problem,
QUESTION:

What's the number presently registered of

landfills?
MR. SKXLLMAN:

The total number of landfills In New

Jersey, presently, is over 300«

And about, I think, between

50 and 100 of those are large commercial landfills.

QUESTION:

And a large commercial landfill wouEd run

to what size?
MR, SKXLLMAN:

Again, it can run 50-100 acres.

It can

vary quite a bit, but it's -»
QUESTION:

Are they pretty well scattered up and down

25

the State?
MR, SKILLMAN:

Veil* 1 think* as Your Honor knows*

there have been., historically* a fairly heavy c on e'en t ration of
landfills in the Hackensack,.-Meadov/lands region* but there are
others scattered throughout the State* yes.

Of course* the

problems are greatest in tl e nest congested areas.
QUESTION:

The commercial type* are they largely in

the Hackensack area? ■
MR, SKILLMAN:

Not the only locations.

There are

some very large commercial ones in the Hackensack-Meadow lands
area* but there are others in Middlesex County, around New
Brunswick.

There are others in the Trenton area.

The particula

landfills that are involved in this case are* I think* mostly
in Burlington County* the Appellants in this case.

So they are

not limited to the Iiackensaek-Meadowlands* but that is. one prime
location, end the location that has probably been the one of
greatest concern to environmentalists in the State of New Jersey
QUESTION:-

Since I was born that has been true.

MR. SKILLMAN:

And. I think, it's only recently that

people have really begun to appreciate the extent of the dangers
of putting garbage into an area which is periodically inundated
by the tide,
QUESTION:

That are you going to do with the garbage?

MR, SKILLMAN:

Wat are us going to do with the

VJhat is anybody going to do with It?

say you can’t dump it, can't burn it and you can’t sat it,
MR, SKILLMAN:

I think the long-run direction is to

try to go towards resource recovery
QUESTION:

As of right now, what do we do?

MR. SKILLMAN:

As of right now, we are going to

continue to clump it into the land and pay the environmental price.
QUESTION:

Not if you can help it.

MR, SKILLMAN:

Vie are going to go ahead

we don’t

have any choice but to go ahead and dump into land the waste that
is generated within the State of New Jersey,

The intent of this

legislation is not to increase the size of an-already great
problem by forcing the State of New Jersey, not only to accommo­
date its own waste »~
QUESTION:

What's Philadelphia going to do?

MR, SKILLMAN:

Well, I think that the primary problem

that Philadelphia has is one of Pennsylvania law.

Pennsylvania

law permits a municipality in the State of Pennsylvania to enact
an ordinance which will prohibit the disposal In that municipality
of waste originating in other municipalities.

The municipalities

that immediately surround Philadelphia have enacted ordinances
which prohibits the disposal in those municipalities of waste
originating in Philadelphia.
So the answer as to what Philadelphia is going to do,
what they should do, they should go to the Pennsylvania

ances —
QUESTION:

Well* you don't have any complaint against

a landfill as being the only feasible method as of now?
MR. SKILLMAN:

We have a complaint against It in the

sense that we do pay a price.

We do have these environmental

problems* but absent another feasible alternative* that's the
way we are going to go ahead and take care of -QUESTION:

You don't have any other one?

MR. SKILLMAN:

We don't have any that are practically

feasible on a wide-scale basis.
QUESTION;

I take it your argument- is you don’t want

to take on Pennsylvania's problems in addition to the problems
New Jersey already has,
MR. SKILLMAN:

Precisely, Your Honor.

It is a matter

of increasing the magnitude of something that's a problem in any
event,
QUESTION: I thought* Mr. Skillman* that the record
showed that* although leachate was and is a problem with most
If not all of the landfill operations in New Jersey and elsewhere*
nonetheless* techniques were available which at the appropriate
cost could be applied to not only mitigate but solve this problem.
MR, SKILLMAN:
Your Honor,

I don't think the record shows that*

j think that —

28
QUESTION:

I've read affidavits in the record —■ maybe

in this Appendix, maybe they were not Introduced,
MR. SKILLMAN:

There is some debate among sanitary

engineers as to whether or not it is possible to construct a
sanitary landfill where you will reduce to a great minimum or
eliminate problems of leachate disposal,
QUESTION:

Like everything else,, it's a matter of cost,

MR. SKILLMAN;

Well, it is a matter of cost and it is

a matter of academic dispute as to whether it is possible, also.
QUESTION:

There are sworn affidavits here from experts

saying that it is possible,
MR. SKILLMAN;

Some experts think it is possible.

There

are some experts who think it Isn't possible,
QUESTION:

Vlas there a judicial finding?

MR. SKILLMAN:

The finding of the Supreme Court of New

Jersey is that landfills cause serious environmental problems.
QUESTION:

Are they not equally available to both

and there are techniques to mitigate those harms , there is no
question . But this is a matter of degree.

New Jersey made findings.
Superior Court?

That's unusual.

What about the

We have two cases here* do we not, the Hackensack

and the -MR. SKXLLMAN;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, did either of the Superior Courts,

on this issue that my brother Stewart raised, did they make a
finding?
MR. SKILL-MAN:

Both of the lower courts found this lav;

to fee unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

No, no.

On leachate, whether you can or

cannot minimize it,
MR, SKILIMAN:

I am getting to that.

They both found

it unconstitutional on the discrimination theory and did not
get into that kind of a factual finding.

Such a factual finding

was made, based upon the record, by the Supreme Court of New
Jersey, also made by the New Jersey Legislature that landfills
cause environmental harm.

So you've get findings by both the

New Jersey Legislature and by the Supreme Court of Nevz Jersey,
generally, on the finding that landfills pose serious environ­
mental and health dangers.

And I would add that those findings

are supported by numerous affidavits in the record and they are
supported by scholarly literature, they are supported by reports

QUESTION:

I mean the elimination of leachate, was there

30
a finding based on conflicting affidavits by the New Jersey
Supreme Court?

MR,

SKILL-MAN:

No,

I can't say there was a specific

finding on the debate In the scientific community whether it was
possible to construct the ideal landfill that eliminates leachate,
But I think that under the existing cases it is clear that the
mere possibility that a landfill may be able to be constructed
somewhere* some day* where the problems will be eliminated* doesn 't
prevent the New Jersey Legislature from taking other constructive
steps to mitigate an existing harm in light of the fact that
every existing landfill anyone can point out does pose these
problems.

And whether or not it’s possible to construct that

ideal landfill is a subject of much debate.
QUESTION;

What you are saying is certainly relevant

to the valid and legitimate exercise of what has compendiously
come to be called the police power by the State of New Jersey.
But that doesn't go to the — certainly doesn't resolve the
commerce question which is a matter of* an issue of constitu­
tional law as the issue before us*
MR, SKILLMAN;

It doesn't resolve it* but it goes

very much to the Commerce Clause question.

This Court has

recognised in its most recent Commerce Clause decision* in the
.Raymond Transportation Company case* that the key consideration
in terms of commerce, or a key consideration is the nature of
che State regulatory concern.

So* in that sense* it goes very

31

directly to the Commerce Clause point,
QUESTION:

Mr* Skillman, could I ask you, to be sure

I have your theory, if you are correct* I suppose every State
could have a similar lav;,

Every State could ban the importation

of waste,
MR, SKILLMAN:

I think, as a practical matter, almost

every State does in one way or another,
QUESTION;

What do you do with a problem of an area,

such as the District of Columbia?

I suppose your answer to that

is well, it would just be terribly, terribly expensive to take
some real estate within the District for disposal purposes, but
that's that locality's problem.
MR, SKILLMAN:

Is that the way you look at it?

Well, I would think that were such a

problem to exist in the District and there were not another
feasible means of resolving that problem, I would have little
doubt but that Congress would address itself ■»-*
QUESTION:

That it would just be
You say that is a

Each State has to bear its own cost

in this area, and interstate commerce is to be disregarded.
There should be no interstate market for waste disposal, is your

32

basic position?
MR* SKILLMAN:

Yes, it is our position that this is

not an area that’s within the free market principles of the
Commerce Clause,
QUESTION:

If you are right, why would you suggest

that Congress could solve the problem, or do you suggest that?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I don’t have any doubt. Your Honor, but

QUESTION:

You are conceding this is an article of

interstate commerce, then?
MR. SKILLMAN:. I am conceding that for purposes of
the exercise of power by Congress that it would constitute
commerce,
QUESTION:

What would?

MR. SKILLMAN:

The sale of — how do you characterize

At least you say it- would affect commerce.

Jt would affect commerce sufficiently

QUESTION:

How about the transportation of waste?

That surely is commerce, isn’t it?
MR» SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Similarly.

Similarly — that is commerce, isn't it?

MR. SKILLMAN:

Surely.

But this Court has recognied

the power of Congress to deal with subjects such as prostitution,
kidnapping, in terms of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.
And the mere fact that Congress has the power to deal with the
subject Biatter under the Commerce Clause does not mean that the
Commerce Clause, by its own force, prevents a State from dealing
with that same subject matter in the fashion that Mew Jersey ~~
QUESTION:

Are you arguing in this case, by the way,

not only that the Federal statute doesn't preempt New Jersey's
effort, doesn't foreclose the statute, but that Congress has
given affirmative consent to New Jersey to do what it has done?
MR. SKILLMAN;

Congress has not spoken directly to this

type of statute, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What if it had said, "We know this is

commerce, but we think that State laws should be the ones to
control it."

And that's all Congress said,

MR, SKILLMAN:

I think it has come close to saying

that with respect to State laws, generally.
QUESTION:

Well, then, you are arguing that Congress

has not only not preempted, but it has affirmatively recognised
-■* and even if it is interstate commerce, it has subjected it to

34
reach of State law.
MR. SKILLMAN:

X think that Congress.’ findings and

approach In the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, at least,
supports the conclusion that the New Jersey Legislature is not
prohibited by the Commerce Clause. We do not rely on that alone,
but it certainly seems to be moving in the same direction, i.e«,
of recognising that problems of .solid waste disposal and manage­
ment are essentially a local province to be governed at the State
and local levels.
QUESTION:

I gather you are saying, at the very least,

Congress hasn’t prevented New Jersey from doing what New Jersey
has done.

On the contrary, the Federal statute encourages New

Jersey to do what it has done.
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s precisely my point, Your Honor.

Let me take you back to the effort to

analogize the District of Columbia to a State.

Isn’t there a

difference in the unique posture of the District of Columbia that
Congress., in fact all of the people of the United States, no
matter what the cost may be to take care of the waste disposal
problem for the District of Columbia, but New Jersey can’t tax
anybody except the people of New Jersey for that purpose.
MR. 3KILLMAN:

That’s true, but I don’t think it is

basic to the reason that New Jersey has enacted this statute.
New Jersey’s basic reasors for enacting the statute are environmenta1

It was one having to do with

In agreement with Your Honor, I don3t want

to indicate anything to the contrary on that point.
QUESTION:

Congress would have the power, would it

not, to go over to Virginia or Maryland and condemn a large
tract of land and take it for a Federal purpose?
MR» SKILLMAN:
QUESTION.;

I have no doubt.
New Jersey has no such power, or

Pennsylvania, to do that with reference to another State, has it?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

It is protected only by the Commerce Clause.

MR, SKILLMAN;
QUESTION:

No, it does not,

That is correct.

Mr. Skillman, in the extent to which Congress

has said New Jersey can do what it has done, has it drawn a dis­
tinction between hazardous and other wastes?
MR* SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean does New Jersey have less, as far

as Congress is concerned.

Congress has reached in and said, "Now

36
we will take care of most of the hazardous waste problem."
It is the rest of it that we need in New Jersey, Is that right?
MR, SKILLMAN:

Yes,, the Resource Conservation and

Recovery Act basically leaves solid waste disposal planning and
management to the States.

One major exception to that is in

the area of hazardous wastes.

And in that area, the Federal

Government has taken — I don't know whether to characterize it
as a preemptive posture, but certainly a very active -QUESTION:

To that extent, then, your statute cannot

apply to hazardous waste?

MR, SKILLMAN:

We have no problem with hazardous

wastes for —»
QUESTION:

Yes, but on its face, it applies to, your

statute applies to it.
MR, SKXLIMAN:
QUESTION:

It doesn’t?

MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

No,

Perhaps, the statute —

I thought you started out and said it

covers all wastes known to man,

MR, SKILLMAN:

Our regulations, which are at page 89

of the Appendix, Section D, specifically excludes hazardous
wastes which are disposed of through a disposal facility,other
than by disposal on or in the land.

And New Jersey presently

does not register any landfill for the disposal of hazardous
wastes in the land*

The only circumstances under which we will

presently register a facility for the disposal of hazardous
waste is by a; processing- or -trertmenfc facility*. And a proces­
sing or treatment facility does not fall within the statute as
qualified and modified by the implementing regulations on page
31 of the Appendix.

QUESTION:

Nell, the issue isn't even here.

MR. SKILLMAN:

It also isn't here for another reason.

There is no indication In this record that the City of.
Philadelphia is generating hazardous waste.

There is no indi­

cation that any of the Appellant landfills receive hazardous
waste.

What we are talking about here is not hazardous waste,

we are talking about common household waste. : So whatever pos­
sible problems there may be of collision between the hazardous
waste provisions of the new Federal Act and legislation similar
to New Jersey's are just not -QUESTION:

Not here in this case.

MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

— here in this case.

The State of New Jersey is not contending

that Congress could not, if it wanted to, preempt the State from
doing whst it's done?
MR. LX Ilf/mi. .1!:

Nw, Your

fto.

I think you asked

33
me the same question last time and it’s the same* vie do not take
that position,
QUESTION:

Mr. Skiilraan* let me try one situation that

seems to rae somewhat analogous on you.

Supposing the New Jersey

Legislature made a finding that there was a great deal of air
pollution caused by power companies* electric utilities* and
therefore* to reduce the environmental hazard associated with
production of power* it passed a statute that said power could
only be produced for consumption within New Jersey,

Would that

be permissible?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I think that would be a much more

difficult kind of a situation.

I think that case would corae

much closer to the natural resource cases* because what you would
be talking about there is not the simple disposal of waste* but
rather the manufacture of a product in which there is a recognized
and established national market.

There also are elements of

particular States being in a better position than others to
produce that particular product.
QUESTION:

Isn't that precisely the point here? There

is an interstate market for waste* some States can dispose of it
more cheaply than others.

Why is that any different?

I mean

each case is a byproduct of environmental harm* one is methane
gas the other Is smoke,
MR, SKILLMAN:

I don’t agree that some States can

dispose of the waste more cheaply than others* for any reasons

other than the legal situation in Pennsylvania that I alluded to
before which is certainly not the type of difference that -»
QUESTION:

Don't you think land cost -- the availabilit;

of large amounts of land

would have something to do with the

cost of disposing in it?
MR, SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

It may, although I don't think --

The hypothesis before was that it is cheaper

to dispose of it in New Jersey than in the District because real
estate is much more expensive and very scarce here.

Isn't it

a function of the availability of vacant land?
MR* SKILLMAN:

I don't think that that point could be

established in the Philadelphia area, that the land is cheaper
on the Jersey side than on the Pennsylvania side.
QUESTION:

If the issue is vacant land, there is a lot

more vacant land in Pennsylvania than there is in New Jersey,
is there not?
MR* SKILLMAN:

In the entire State there Is.

In terms

of areas that are sufficiently proximate to Philadelphia, I don't
know if there is more, but I don't think there is any less.
QUESTION:

It may cost Philadelphia more to get it

off in the Poconos Mountains, or some place, and they might ran
into a lot of problems about that, but at least there is more
of it available than New Jersey has,
MR, SKILLMAN:

I think that for the State, as a whole,

there certainly is more of it.

Whether or not, I don't want to

say that within proximate distance of Philadelphia «■QUESTION:
on this?

Excuse me.

Because it worries me.

Is there anything in there on value, on

land values around* either in Philadelphia* around Philadelphia,
or on the Jersey side* or are we just surmising on this?

MB. SKILLMAN:

I think that the topic is alluded to

in one affidavit* Your Honor* but the record is pretty.scant,
The record is not good on that particular point.
QUESTION:

Even the land in the Poconos is not the

cheapest land in the country.
MR» SKILLMAN:
Jersey* Your Honor.
QUESTION:

We don't have any cheap land In New

It's all pretty expensive.
In a certain sense* Mr. Skillman* if your

proponent's argument is bought* a State which does not* itself*
have any large cities in it* but which has neighboring States
that have large cities on its borders*is going to be subjected
to a certain degree of servitude in that the State without any
large cities can simply

cannot under the Commerce Clause

ban the disposal of refuse from other States without banning
disposal of its own.

Whereas* the State with the large cities

in it* can simply ban all disposal of refuse and force Its own
cities to look elsewhere,
MB. SKILLMAN:

That* as a practical matter* is the

41
situation we have today,

Pennsylvania, as I mentioned before --

these surrounding communities have ordinances that say, "We don’t
'

want Philadelphia waste."
QUESTION; "And we won’t take New Jersey waste, either,"
and therefore they don't violate the Commerce Clause, but they
si/iply make Philadelphia go elsewhere.
MR, SKILLMAN:

That's correct, those particular munici­

palities take only their own, won't take either Philadelphia or
New Jersey*
I think that the case that really comes closest to this
case —
QUESTION:

One question on that, Mr* Skillraan, does

the record tell us whether most of these large areas are within
the boundaries of municipalities or are some of them out in rural
areas?

Pennsylvania is where the municipalities have taken up

all of the existing territory.
MR. SKILIMAN;
in our rural areas,

We have large sprain ling municipalities

J. don’t think we have .such a thing as an
t

area that's not part of a municipality and subject to the ordin­
ances of a municipality,
QUESTION:

It allows each municipality to preempt it

for itself, and therefore the whole State becomes unavailable
for anyone else.
MR* SKILLMAN:

Nell, if not the whole State, at least

what is the prime area, which is those communities that are

42

immediately surrounding Philadelphia.

I can't speak to the

whole State,
QUESTION:
it a prime area?

You mention prime area»

What factor makes

Just proximity?

MR* SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Does land value have anything to do with

it?
MR, SKILLMAN.*

No,, I think that the main variable is

hauling distance from point of origin to point of disposal.

You

are talking about tremendous volume when you are talking about
ordinary household waste, and it has to be within some reasonable
hauling distance, whether it is 60 miles, 70 or 100 miles.
can't be 250 miles away when it's that kind of waste.

It

When it

is more complicated, hazardous waste that's in smaller quanti­
ties, then we can have disposal half way across the country,
for example, radioactive waste.
I think the case that comes closest to this case, in
terms of the Commerce Clause issue, is the case of Clason v.
State of Indiana, which the Court decided in 1939.

The Court

in that ease upheld an Indiana statute which, in practical effect
prohibited the interstate transportation of animal carcasses
not slaughtered for food.

We would submit that there is no

significant difference,in Commerce Clause terms, between the
disposal of dead animals end the disposal of waste.

And that

the Clason case, therefore, provides very direct and very strong

■support for the position of th^StattvQf New Jersey that its
prohibition upon the disposal, within New Jersey, of waste
originating out of State is consistent with the Commerce Clause.
Thank you.
