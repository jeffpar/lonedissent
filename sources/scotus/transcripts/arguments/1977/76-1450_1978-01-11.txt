ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAIIS ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ABRAMS:
the Court:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it .>lease

This is an appeal from the criminal conviction of

•che publisher of a newspaper.

The crime for which it uas

been convicted and fined is the publication by the newspaper
of the name of a judge, a judge against whom charges had
been filed before the Virginia Inquiry and Review Commission.
The; article in question was printed in October 1975 by The
Virginiar-Filot, a Norfolk newspaper, which is printed by
Landmark.

The report in the article was in all relevant

respects accurate, that is, not disputed, and indeed that is
the essence of tha crime.
The article referred to had identified a judge
who had been investigated by a commission, the Judicial
Inquiry unc Review Commission, established to investigate
charges which could be the basis of retirement,
or

removal, from the bench.

censure,

The article stated that no

formal charges had been —
QUESTION:

You characterize them as charges.

Is

4
not the process on@ of inquiry?
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, sir.

There ware accusations

pending before the Commission, and the Commission was inquiring
into the accusations which had been made.
QUESTION:

The charges are complaints from various

miscellaneous sources.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But not from any official source.

MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Not a criminal charge.

MR. ABRAMS:

That is correct.

The newspaper article stated that no formal
complaint had been mad© by the Commission in the Supreme
Court of Virginia .and it. stated that that indicated that the
Commission . either had found insufficient cause for action
or that this case was still under review by the Commission
itself.
'

A month after the article was printed, Landmark

was indicti id and charged under section 2.1-37-13 of the
Virginia Code with the crime of having unlawfully divulged
tins name or a judge at a. time when the judge was the subject
of an investigation and hearing by the Commission.
section of law

Under the

which Landmark was accused of violating,

all papers filed with the Commission and testimony before 'it
are required to be confidential.,

Any person who divulges —

5
that is the statutory language — information in violation of
this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, a crime punishable
in Virginia by a prison sentence of up to a year and ip to
a thousand dollars fine.
At trial the only evidence

by the Commonwealth

other thiin the article; itself v/as a stipulation of evidence
entered into by the Commonwealth and Landmark which stated
that Landmark had printed the issues in question, that The
Virginian-Pilot had published the October 4 article, that the
article had identified e judge who had in fact been
investigated by the Commission, and that at the time the
article was published the Commission had not filed a formal
complaint concerning the judge with the Supreme Court of
Virginia.

The latter part of the stipulation, I third i.t may

ba said, adverted to the- fact that under Virginia lav/ once
a formal charge is filed with the Supreme Court of Virginia,
everything about the proceeding which is filed does become
then public'.
Mo other evidence v/as offered by the Commonwealth
at trial.

At the trial Landmark urged that properly and

constitutionally construed, the statute should be held to
apply to the first disclosure of information by a participant
involved in the proceeding itself but not to the later
public-vtion by a newspaper of information learned by it.
Landmark urged, as I urge today, that to apply the statute

6

to it for publication of a news article identifying a judge
would violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, is there anything in the

record of which wa may properly taka cognisance of how Landmark
learned of the facts that it published?
MR. ABRAMS:

No, tlier© is nothing in the record

whatsoever,
On January 15 —
QUESTION:
knows that.

I suppose only the editor of the paper

Would that be a reasonable assumption?
MR. ABRAMS?

I think it is a reasonable assumption

that the editor and the journalist involved know that.
QUESTION:

And perhaps some others, but those two,

of course, must know about it.
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, your Honor.

Landmark was convicted in January 1976 and fined
$500.

On appeal to the Supreme Court, of Virginia, the

conviction was affirmed by a 6-to-l vote.
bf. considering the opinion,

I will, of course,

throughout tha course of my

argument, but I think it may fairly be said in summary that
the opinior held that tha statute applied to Landmark and
that the statute as so applied was constitutional.

Probable

jurisdicticn was noted by this Court in June of this year.
QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, under your reading of the

Virginia Supreme Court opinion, do you think the statute would

7
apply to yea if you told us the name of the judge?

I notice

the briefs are very careful not to tell us who it is.
MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I think

it would

unless there was some other privilege which protected me
because I was in this courtroom.

I have little doubt that

it would apply to me if I were to walk outside and provide
the name of tha judge, vrith on© caveat, that this Court has
decided, of course, that once papers are publicly filed in
court, tha crass may print with impunity what is contamed in
them.

So I suppose in this particular case, since there was

a criminal prosecution and since there is the stipulation
which I adverted to earlier, that I could with impunity speak.
If chars had been no prosecution, if the newspaper article
had be»a printed and no prosecution had followed, it seams to
me chat the Virginia statute must apply by the terms of the
opinion of the Virginia Supreme Court if I were to repeat to
someone aIsa the information contained in the article.
in the interim between the ruling of the Virginia
Supreme Court and this argument, three separata judges in
Virginia have enjoined enforcement of the challenged portion
of the statute for various periods of time as against on© or
another newspaper or television station in Virginia.
E think it useful at the outset that we turn to the
scop© of tbs statute, as I understand it

as interpreted by

the Virginia Supreme Court, and it is this;

Unless and until

8
formal charges are filed by the Commission with the Supreme
Court of Virginia, Virginia law now makes it, a crime ever to
publish any "information concerning a proceeding before the
Ccmmissicn," including the identity of a judge.
QUESTION:

How v/ould the statute apply, if it would

apply, tc the person who released the information?
MR. ABRAMS:

It would apply to the parser* who

released tha information.
QUESTION:

He or she would be guilty of the same

crime.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Even if it was the chairman of the

Commission.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Indeed.

There is no -—

Or a member of the Supreme Court of the

State of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia.
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, your Honor.

There is no # accept ion .

And I should point, out in that respect that the Virginia
Supreme. Court had argu ed to it various narrowing ways of
reading t'rai?, statute and did not, adopt any narrowing way to
-read it.

It seems to me that the statute must be read so as

to apply to a statement by the chairman of the Commission and,
indeed, to male® criminal the publication by th© newspa]>er of
that statement even if it ware a. press conference.

That I

think is tha dew minimis holding of the Virginia Supremo Court.

9

QUESTION:

Is your submission that the statute

is unconstitutional as applied to anybody or just -the press?
MR. ABRAMS:

It is my submission today that it

is unconstitutional as applied to anyone who is not the party
before the Commission..

We have a press case today,

I think

that has bearing on your Honors' decision, but I do not
argue to you today that the statute is unconstitutional as
it applies to a participant before the Commission itself.
It does seem to me that there may be some problems with that,
but that ir> not tee heart of my argument.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume — so your argument, is

that even :.f it is wholly constitutional to forbid the
participants from disclosing anything, nevertheless, it is
unconstitutional as applied to the press.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
All you need to argue is that it is

uncons'titutional as applied to your client in this case..
MR. ABRAMS:

Yas.

I would say that the most of

the arguments that I would make to you today would apply as
well to saneone that rends the newspaper and then repeats it
to someone else, because the statute doss go that far..

Bui:

my argument to you today applies to my cliant, and it would
apply to any other newspaper which had
QUESTION:

But none of your arguments would

question the underlying validity of the statute as applied to

1C
participants, is that it?
MR. ABRAMS:

I have not gcma that far, your Honor.

That is correct.
QUESTION:
Stewart suggested.

Of course, you need not, as Justices
But what if the judge who is the subject

of the inquiry called a press conference and said, "I welcome
tills inquiry and, of course, I will be vindicated swiftly.”
MR. ABRAMS:

Your Honor, it seems to me that the

only way to read the statute is that the judge would lav©
4

violated the provisions of the statute; the newspaper,if it
prints what, the judge said, "would have violated it; and any
reader of the newspaper who repeats what the newspaper said
would have violated it.
Let ms take the case, if I may, that this Court
heard yesterday.

If the Stump case which this Court heard

yesterday bad arisen in Virginia, if the plaintiff in that
case had filed charges before the Virginia Commission against
Judge Stumf and if that information had become known to the
pioss, it would bo a crime for the press to have printed it;
if th® individual, who was the plaintiff in the case, had
mad© a public statement to that effect, it would have bean a
crime for bar to have made that statement.

Th® scop© of the

statute i.s that broad, and it seems to me necessarily that
broad giver, th© language of the statute and surely tee language
of th® Supreme Court of Virginia.

11
QUESTION:

Do you think your cliant8s protection

is in any way diminished by the fact that it's a corporation?
MR. ABRAMS s

I don't think so, your Honor.

Certainly to the extent that what we urg© on you is promised
on the press clause of the Constitution, and it is, I know of
no case which suggests that a corporation which owns a news­
paper is not entitled to full First Amendment rights as
interpreted by this Court.
QUESTION:

Corporations arid individuals stand, on

ars, equal footing then.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

I would so argue, your Honor.
That is at least so far as the protection

of -the press goes.
MR. ABRAMS:

At least, so far as the press.

Certainly it has never been suggested otherwise in any of
your press decisions.

In New York Times v. Sullivan there

was no loss protection foscaus© it was a corporation.
QUESTION:

Is there any reason to think that if it

is so as to the press, it’s different as to freedom of
expression:
MR. ABRAMS:

As a general matter, your Honor, it

seems to me that this case could be decided as a freedom-ofexpression case without necessarily relying on the press
clause itself.

As I suggested earlier to Mr. White, I do

think that the statute is unconstitutional for many of the

12
same reasons \m urge tinder the press clause under the speech
clause as vrell

if

1 were charged with a violation of the

statute for repeating what I war© to read in a newspaper„
W© do have a press clause case today,

I think we are bolstered

even more by the fact that it is that kind of case and that
teis kind of statute strikes so directly,, as w© view it, at.
press freedom.

But if that were not so, 1 think most of the

arguments that I am making to you today would also apply.
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting the First.

Amendment protection reaches only to corporations which publish
newspapers.
MR. ABRAMS:

No, your Honor.

But they certainly

do roach corporations which publish newspapers.
Wo have already discussed com® examples of the
scope of the statute.

I would just cite one more, which also

arose in Virginia and which is adverted to in the briefs of
the parties. Whan a Vi.rQ.inia judge allegedly dismissed a. law
clerk who had testified against him before the Commission,
and that allegation was contained on the AP wire servic«i
dispatch which went throughout the country and into Virginia,
that story could only be printed by Landmark because on©
Federal judge in Richmond had previously entered an order
enjoining enforcement of the statute against Richmond'newspapers
on First Amendment grounds and because another Federal judge
in Norfolk entered a temporary restraining order enjoining

13

prosecutio* of Landmark for printing what the Richmond papers
printed with respect to this subject.
But again, without question, that, story would have
been forbidden within the scop® of the Virginia statuta.
It seems to me important to make clear also at the
outset what this case does not involve.

This is not an

and First Amendment rights being kept in some kind of

And the case doss not deal with any kind of

kind of limit as to time, place, or manner of expression.
Phis is, if tli© Court please, a classic or rather

It is a case which raises, at

the outset at least, the question of whether a law does or
dees net abridge freedom of th© press when it makes criminal

14
the truthful printing of facts about public officials relating
to their public duties.
In our view, the very notion that such kind of
publication may be mad© criminal is abhorrent to deeply
rooted constitutional principles.
QUESTION:

Of course, this is really not an old-

fashioned First Amendment cases because this isn’t the Federal
Government that's involved, is it?
MR. ABRAMS QUESTION:

No, it is not the Federal Government*
It's a Fourteenth Amendment case-:,

isn't it?
MR. ABRAMS:

It's a First through Fourteenth

Amendment ease, yes, your Honor.,
QUESTION:

That's pretty old-fashioned by now,

isn't it?
MR. ABRAMS:

It's pretty old-fashioned to me<

This Court, has mad® clear that truth is a defense,
a constitutionally required defense in libel cases. "Truth,;l
the Court said in the Garrison case, "may not be the subject

And the Court has mad® clear,

of course, in a number of very recent decisions that even

First Amendment protection.
How then can a truthful report about an official

foo proper

as

regards

They may

well

participants before the Commission

itself, but they fall far short of any which could conceivably
permit incursions into First. Amendment rights by way of
criminal punishment for publication.
The Supreme Court of Virginia relies first on the
question of the reputation of the judge 'who is accused by a
complainant before the Commission and the reputation of the
judiciary in general. But this Court has already included in
Hovr York Times v. Sullivan and elsewhere that, injury to official
reputation affords no mere warrant for repressing speech that

16
would otherwise b© fros than doss factual error.

.and in fact

the Virginia statute, as the Chief Justice's question earlier
suggests, doss permit as much harm as assistance to judicial
reputation sine© it makes criminal publication of the fact
that a judge's reputation has been cleared.
There is also the need asserted in the opinion of
fch<3 Supremo Court of Virginia to protect complainants and
witnesses from retribution by judges against whom they offer
testimony.

And this casa, I should say, does not involve such

a situation at all since all that is involved here, the only
claim made hare in the indictment, is that Landmark unlawfully
rovaalad the name of a judge under investigation.

Moreover,

the statuto does not even provide full protection for
witnesses.

Surely, and indeed under the statutory language.,

once a claim is filed, once a complaint is filed

before the

Supreme Court of Virginia by th© Commission, the judge
against whom it is filed receives full access to the testimony
against him, as he should, at least. I would argues
c onstituticma 1 ly —
QUESTION;
MR. ABRAMS;
-

P

It’s public? anybody can us® it.
Yes, sir, at that point it’s public

and anybody has full access to it.

But if the purpose, if the

jus tiff, cation for the kind of suppression, as we view it, or
the punishment at least, of the praes in this case is said to
bo that this witnesses need to be protected, my point is that

17
O3o.ce the charge is filed with the Supreme Court of Virginia,
everything does become fully public.
QUESTION %
Abrams.

I don't understand the argument, Mr.

If no charge is filed, wouldn't the need for protection

remain for the same period of time that the statute requires
confidentiality ?
MR. ABRAMSs
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

If no charge is filed •—
The judge may never even know about it.
It is possible that, the judge nay not

know about it.
Now, we do have an instance which I referred to
earlier of a court, clerk — at least this is what is alleged
'e

# #

in the pe.pers in the case filed by the court clerk — '*■»• which
the court clerk has alleged that as a result of her making
charges against the judge for whom she worked, she was
dismissed.

I think the question doss arise as to whether a

court clerk or witness is better protected by being able to
have the benefits of publicity in a situation in which she
feels retribution, or alleges retribution, than to be leprived
of the chance to have anything said about her.
In short, what I am saying is that I understand
that fibers is an argument that a statute such as this, by
keeping things confidential, helps to protect witnesses in
that period prior to the charge's baing filed, that there is
a counterargument that there are situations in which witnesses

18

are as wall protected by publicity, at least whan they want
it, and this statuta prevents that kind of publicity»

In.

any event, as I have said, that is not really raised, as I
view it, by this case since that justification for the
criminal punishment on Landmark is no justification for
criminal punishment of Landmark sine© what is involved here
is not. tli© disclosure of a witness' name.
If this caca did involve the disclosure of a
witness' -QUESTION:

Isn't it entirely possible that, if there

were total confidentiality, the judge never knew about it and
thf. Commission decided tier* was no merit iio a charge, it was
dismissed, he. would never have any reason to retaliate against
anyone.

Wh ureas if tha :.iame of the judge is disclosed, he

knows th*re has been an investigation, he knows there is omt
likely person who has boon his enemy throughout his life who
probably said something to the Commission, there is thsn
created a danger of retaliation.

I think it is at least

possible —
MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, that is possible,

and I do not deny that the statute could havs in this and
othir ways a salutary «affect.

It does seem to me aven vith

respect, to this particular area of inquiry, that on.® may
properly ask, as one does in any First Amendment esse, whether
there ar® lass restrictive ways of going about that, task even

19
of protecting witnesses f and w® have suggested in our briefs
that there may well bo, that there may b© monitoring programs
of judges, that, it may b® mad© a crime, could be made a
crime, for a judg® so to act which would hav© a desired
chilling effect, I suppose, upon a judge in ‘that type
situation,
We would submit to you that whatever standard is
used to adjudge this statute, it cannot withstand ‘the First
Amendment scrutiny provided by tills Court.
t

The statute

a.

p unishes the accurate reporting of news.

It does so in the

name of interests which, as I have observed her®, are not
specifically raised h«r«> in ‘bills case or are not protected
under the statute, but which in any ©vent cannot under «my
standard override First Amendment interests.
Mow, there is much in the briefs filed before you
with resyact to the clear and present danger doctrine■

That

is not, we submit, a doctrine which commends itself to you
for application in this cas© or perhaps any other.

But even

if it did, wa submit that the interests involved here do not
approach that raised in the other cases in which the clear
and present danger has been applied.
QUESTION s

Why do you say this clear and present

danger doctrine is not on® which should commend itself to us
generally?
MR. ABRAMSs

Well, it saerns to me, Mr. Justice

20

R&hnquist? that the doctrine has been eroded by a variety of
decisions by this Court — Braacl.arJjurg v«, Ohio has been one;
of the more recent ones*

and indead in New York Timg;s v-

Sullivan, ’die very recent on®? at least of applicability in
the press area if no other,

it seems to me that the problem

with the clear and present danger doctrine as often applied?
at least as applied in the Dennis case? is that it was
changed so significantly from what I perceive to bo its
initial meaning by the. adoption of Judge Hand’s test cf the
probability of th® harm discounted by the likelihood of its
appearance and th© like? that at least as a First Amendment
test it doesn't provide an. awful lot of protection.
QUESTIONS

Would you adhere to your same position

if we war© talking about. J stice Holmes' initial formulation
of it in Sohenck?
MR. ABRAMS;

I would argue that if the Schonck

case were 1 .are now ana. we didn't have all the history that we
had, the Court could have gone quit© a bit farther than it
did in Schonck itself.

Th© clear and present danger doctrine

as set forili in Schenck did not provide, at least on the face
of the Sch€nek ruling? anything like the kind of First
Amendment protection which this Court has sine© com® to
award to the parties accused.
I do want to make clear -chat even th© Denni s holding
of this Court? which from a parochial First Amendment point of

21
viawf if you will, is not generally celebrated, is one which
wo can live under in this case because at first what Judge
Hand did ai d what the .Court did in the Demis case was to
start winch a notion, of the gravity of the harm discounted by
the probability of the harm apparent.

And what I would urge

on you is Ichafc an espionage act case or a national security
cas© is a very different level of gravity than what w© have
her© and., indeed, the Bridges cas®. and casas essentially
involving firth Amendment rights or the right to fair trial
or the right to a judge who is not placed in a position where
he simply can't functi,on, issues such as that raised in
Bridges,arc not raised in this case.
QUESTION;

What would you say about this cese

if there were proof that this judge could not function,
effectively if his name war© disclosed right on the eve of a
trial or something?
MR. ABRAMSs

Mr. Justice Stevens, I would say then

that for th® other reasons I asserted earlier, that that, was;
/

& social price which the First Amendment requires us to pay.

People are attacked in the press, sometimes very unjustly#
and sometimes are less able to function because of it.
QUESTION;

What is your test?

I am pu2zl@d, as

Mr. Justice R@haqu.ist is, by your saying wo shouldn't look at
the eloar rad present danger.

I take it you do accept the

possibility that it might be a national security type of fact

22
situation which might justify suppression even of publication
by the press.

What kind of limit would you say would b®

appropriate for that sort of exception, if there is on a?
MR. ABRAMS s

What I would suggest is that, first of

all, the way the Court, ought to approach such issues is to
try to do it so far as is possibles in terms of categories of
speech which ara or are not protected speech and then deal
with the question of what kind of test to apply to speech or
expression which may not be protected.

But it seems to me

that the starting placa is is 'this the kind of area in which
there can b@ any limitis of speech or free expression at all?
Now,' what we Urge to you. at the outset is that at
least witJi respect to truthful speech about public officials,
in the:- course of their public functions is that there is no
area, none, for the imposition of criminal sanctions for
publication.
QUESTIONs

Than you disagree with that part cf the

Schtsnck cast! which talks about a substantive evil which th©
Government has a right to prevent.
MR. .ABRAMS s

I think that that lias been much ©reeled

through Wis, years, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, at least that is
dependent upon one’s notion of what a substantive evil is.
But as recently as Elrod v. Bums th© Court mad© clear that
a reasonable kind ©£ danger, a reasonable kind of stats
interest is act enough, it has to be at least a compelling.

23

QUESTION:

Wes there a Court opinion in Elrod?

MR. ABRAMS:

No, there was not, a Court opinion in

Elrod, but there was a Court opinion in the Buckley case
which used very similar language as to that.
I do think it, is fair to say that, at least as 1
road this Court's opinions, that the Court as a. body has
corn® to tho view that the kind of presumption of constitu­
tionality of a State statute in this area that used to be
applied, is no longer applied, and that something more than
a reasonable Stats interest must exist so as to permit, the
imposition of sanctions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, did the State at any time

mly on the clear and present danger doctrine?
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS
Justice Marshall.

Did the State do what, sir?
Rely on that in this case?
The State did — lot m® say this, Mr.

Both sides argued in court

of the clear and present danger doctrine»
part

on the basis

Landmark argued in

laelow that that clear and present danger doctrine

could nob ha met in any ©vent because there was no factual
proof addu> ad by the State and that that at least was on© of
t'l.fi

r<squir< -mants, a minimal requirement of application.
QUESTION:

My question was wh&t did the Stats;

show about clear and present danger?
MR,, ABRAMS s

Th© state showed nothing.

put in, no «e vidence other than that, which I —question:

MR. ABRAMS:
of evidence*.

As we have it here.
All that you have is the stipulation

There was a stipulation of evidence which was

no more than that the article was printed by Landmark and that
that was what it said.

The only findings of clear and

present danger are contained in the opinion of the Supreme
Court of Virginia itself.
QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of Virginia did

make that finding.
MR, ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.
They based it on th® legislative history

and th© obvious purpose of th© legislation and th® general
background

There was no evidence produced at. the trial.
MR. ABRAMS;

Th© Supreme Court of Virginia mad© a

finding -chat sanctions were indispensable to tie prevention
of a loss of confidentiality.
QUESTION:

And the purpose was to protect the

administration of justice.
MR. ABRAMSs

Yes, sir.

It made that finding.

It

did not base it on legislative history since there was none:
as such save th© language of th© Virginia Constitution which
required confidentiality and th© language of th® statute
which I adverted to earlier.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say they indulged in

a presumption that that was the reason the legislature
enacted the statute?
MR. ABRAMS %

I think that is very fair to say, Mr.

Chief Justice.
QUESTION;

Mr. Abrams, ars there other laws

around, the country against the publication of grand jury
/

proceedings?
MR. ABRAMS;
your Honor.

I believe there ar® soma such laws,

Thar© is no Federal law to that effect.
QUESTION;

Ar® there State laws against tho press

publishing confidential information from grand juries?
MR. ABRAMS:

Thar© may be.

There is none .in

I don't know of any, but I could

QUESTION:

But anyway, I would take it that

situation would be involved in the decision in this casts.
MR, ABRAMS:

It could be, your Honor.

It depends or.

whether, for on® thing, the Court were to view the grand jury
at least as possibly different because of the historic role
of secrecy in grand jury proceedings.

But I would say, your

Honor, that it would be our submission to you at leas'; -that
a law which made it a crime to print a leak from a. grand jury
would b® unconstitutional for some of the same reasons -that
we urge upon you in this case.
QUESTION:

Isn't there a difference in that a grand

26

jury is concerned exclusively with criminal conduct whereas
a commission of this kind is inquiring into fitness for duty.
Isn't that an important difference?
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, that is on® very relevant

difference.
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

Which way does it cut?
Well, I think it would cut at least

in favor of us in this cas® and mat;:© the grand jury esse, if

to win this case and lose the grand jury case?
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

I hop© so, your Honor.
You hop®.
I think so.

On® really could

distinguis!' it if you believe that either because of the
historic nature of the- secrecy and the reasons for it and the
peculiar reason for the existence of the Commission Mr®
adverted tc by th© Chief Justice that those were differences.
*■

I certainly didn't mean to run from your question and suggest

W

that if you. vara to rule in our favor in this case that it
would not have any bearing on a grand jury case.
QUESTION:

I don't quit® see why you responded to

27

the Chief Justice and Justice White’s question, that the
difference in the nature of the Commission as opposed to a
grand jury cuts in your favor rather than the other* way,
MR, ABRAMS:

To the extent what is involved in

the Commission is a determination of the fitness

of public

officials for their public service, it seems to us that;if
anything^that cuts more in favor of fuller freedom to publish,

What about the facts presented bo a

‘ -X -r

MR. ABRAMS:

Your Honor; this fact -that President

was printed

I want to make clear that I do think, that that

case, if t.iere were a Federal statute, as there is no'c, that
that case would lx*, close to this bux. not quite the same as
this.

All I am saying is that if the question is whether

grand jury secrecy in general — sorry, if the question is
whether a iecision in our favor in this case would necessarily
govern the question of the constitutionality of the statute
with respect to publication by the press of information from
grand juries regardless of what the information was, that I
tnink

if one must distinguish between them, that we had the

stronger case because we are only dealing here with the
fitii.e8s of public officials.

Isn’t it also true you made at ‘che

investigated

by the grand jury?

HR.ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You might have an independent policy reason

for saying that should be confidential.
MR. ABRAMS;

/absolutely, and that is, of course,

one of the main reasons in favor of grand jury secrecy.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. KULP ON
BEHALF OF APPELLLL
MR. KULP:
tins Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

On behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia I would

not try to tell tnis Court that the questions and issues in
this Court are easy or ones which the Commonwealth have not
wrestled with.

But I would say that the circumstances and

the facts of this case, come to this Court under quite
different circumstances than other cases which have. been,
ruled upon by this Court.
I speak, for example, of cases, such as Oklahoma
Publishing Company and Cox Broadcasting Company, where this
Court has said, and we do not make any contention otherwise,
that once information is placed in the public domain there
is absolutely no prohibition to it being made public cr being

2D
published in the news paper s.

Also, additionally, in 'chose

cases where the Court lias, in Bridges v. California and
Bennekamp v. Florida, in Craig v. Harney, in Wood v. Georgia,
where there were statements or criticisms printed about judges
in the newspapers, we again say that the factual situation
of this case is gravely different from that on the basis
that the information which was published in those articles
occurred in the public domain and this Court said specifically
that there were no legislative prior enactments which would
give this Court any guidance as to the legislative intent.
We submit to the Court chat in this case we have
not only a legislative intent, but we have the intent
manifested by the vote of the people of the Commonwealth of
Virginia.
I would like no go into just: a little bit: of
history as to the reasons for the enactment of this particular
statute under consideration today.
Prior to the enactment of the Constitution in
1971, Virginia had the ways of removal of an unfit julg,

or

one who was guilty of misconduct, the provisions of impeachment:
There was also the situation in Virginia that judges are
elected by the legislature for differing periods of time,
depending on whether they are justices of the Stave
Court and on down, sc

Supreme

at each time when the legislature would

meet to consider the reappointment of a judge, of course,

30

•chat; pre.Sighted an opportunity for information to be given, as
to his character, his fitness for his position.
;?or over 200 years in the Commonwealth of Virginia
there is not a single reported case wherein a judge v/as
removed £ran office by impeachment.

The citizens of the

Commonwealth of Virginia recognize that there must be some
better way in order to effectively and efficiently deal with
errant judges, judges who are becoming senile, or other
physical incapacities.
States were doing.

Virginia then looked to what other

California, I think, is the leading Star*

in tills area, where they enacted legislation setting up a
Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission.
Cnc of the cornerstones and the hallmark of chat
legislation was cited to be by Judge Neely,

of California,

who was a former chairman of the California Commission,

that

the confidentiality of these proceedings is a necessary componerh
in order to affectively administer the system.
Forty Statas, including the Commonwealth of
Virginia, and Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia all
iava made provisions either by constitutional mandate or by
statutory mandats- to set up a review commission of the nature
and type of -she Commonwealth of Virginia.
QUESTIONn
so Virginia'

Ilow many of them have a statute comparable

on the disclosure aspect?

MR. KULPi

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to answer your

31
questio», first, each of the 42 require cor.fider.tic.lity»

The

only other statute that compares exactly, I think , or I would
say comparatively with Virginia is Hawaii.

Hawaii makes it

a. felony to make a disclosure of confidential information.
There are three other Statas —QUESTION:

On. th© disclosure in terms of the

internal function or on the publisher of the disclosed
material,, or both?
MR. KULP:

I would hava to say I think it is

both, but w® really don’t have a case which has construed
that.

The only case, as I pointed out in my brief, is

pending presently in the Supreme Court of Hawaii, and in that
case it actually was a disclosure by a complainant, which is
a little bit different from the cas© we hava today.
QUESTION:

What would you think if the judge who

was under inquiry called a press conference and said he
welcomed tie inquiry and he was sure he would be vindicated?
MR. KULP:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that a

question similar to that was answered by the State of
California in

McCartney v. the Commission.

In that case

the judge under investigation made a request teat tee
Commission open up the hearing to tee public, I assume for
the same vary reasons that your Honor is suggesting, teat
hi thought teat he would be vindicated.

But tea Supreme

Court of California found that while it might b@ argued that

the confidentiality has on® of its main purposes to protect
tlie judge from unfounded, allegations and that if he so
desired

that he could himself waive that privilege# they

found, nonetheless, that, that was not the only reason»

They

gave other reasons, for the protection of witnesses and
complainants, and that was the reason, in addition to the
protection

of judges, that they therefore held that the

Commission had not violated any constitutional provision by
not allowing- the hearing to he open.
QUESTION:
of this statute that

Is one of your reasons for a justification
if confidentiality is not guaranteed,

that witnesses, complainants, will not. come forward?
MR. KULP:

If it pleas® the Court, Mr. Chief

Justice., I don’t think there is any question about, than.
History end experience has so shown.

All of the legal writers,

every court that has decided a case, every State that lias
taken a. lock at it

has com® up with the same exact conclusion.

There was a recent study of attorneys, for example, and they
said without equivocation that they would not make complaints
against sitting judges if they had any question that their
names would be divulged as the original complainant.
I think it goes without saying that it would b@
very difficult for a judge who is sitting in the same circuit
with another judge to make a complaint and that his name be
brought, into the matter.

And under the provisions of 'the

33

Virginia statute, the original complainant's name is naver
divulged ©van in those situations where the case goes to the
Supreme; Court, of Virginia, because the Commission never makes
the name of a complainant a matter of public record.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kulp, are you talking about

confidentiality or criminal prosecution when you say that you
can't do it and that these witnesses insist on.

What do they

Confidentiality or the prosecution of the newspaper?
MR. KULP:

Well, I think, Mr. Justice Marshall,

Mr. Justice Marshall, that if th® citizens around th®

QUESTION:

Why is a judge entitled to that special

treatment?

35
MR. KULPs

I don’t think it is just the judges.

That’s not what the Supreme Court, of Virginia said.

Who else is covered by this?

MR. KULP:

I think

they are allegations made

only against judges, I agree with that.
QUESTION:

That’s what

I am saying.

Why is that

particular phase of government deserving of this special
protection?

I am not sure whether it is right or wrong.

There must be a reason for it.
MR. KULP:

I think that because of the fact ‘that

I think we hav#s a difference between the administration of
justice, which the Supreme Court of Virginia found is the
reason, on the one handand on the other hand where you have
legislative ancl executive situations, particularly in Virginia,
they are purely political.
tumble.

They are used to the rough and

They have ways to defend themselves.

But if m.s said

that the confidentiality in this case, as several of the
Justices have indicate,, that if it ware limited to witnessts,
then, you see, the newspapers whan they print the informat:»on,
first of all, will not give us the information as to who broke
their oath of secrecy and who breached the confidentiality.
We asked them for the information and they refused to give
it to us.

S© we have no viable protection.

And I submit

to the Court that the whole history shows that in this case —
I agres

with Mr. Abrams as far as tha Landmark case is

concerned? which is tee cas<a be fora this Court? that there
hasn't been any printing in the article bar® giving the
name of any complainant nor giving the name of any witness.
But I do contest their contention in the brief that that has
baan the theme of publication in Virginia because it simply
has not.

As I indicated in the appendix to the Commonwealth's

brief? page 4.1? the Riclunond newspaper printed not only the
name of the judge that was under investigation but it printed
the names of the witnesses and additionally gave the name of
the attorney who was the original complainant and his law
firm.
QUESTION;

Which would never be released und«sr

normal circumstances.
MR. KULP:

That's correct.

No? sir? I would have to go back on teat because
this particular article? Mr, Justice Marshall? dealt with a
judge which in fact did go to the Supreme Court of Virginia
where the aame of the complainant would not be released even
in ter public papers.

The names of tee witnesses would.

As I have indicated? tea Supreme Court of Virginia
said that vhafc this statute attempts to do is to protect the
complainants and witnesses until such time as the Commission
has found sufficient background and sufficient justification
to bring a formal complaint.
As Mr. Justice Stevens was mentioning a moment ago?

wo know, for example

„

th® reports are from California that

well over, 1 think, about two-thirds, 50 percent to two-thirds,
somewhere in 'that neighborhood, of the complaints are found
to be initially frivolous.

Now, if we didn't have and didn't

provide th© confidentiality, th© names of these people who
made these complaints in, good faith, the names of -any people
who may have been called upon to give witness, to give
testimony, in th© preliminary stages, all of their names
would be subject to being released,

hnd we submit to th®

Court that that’s what we are attempting to, and th© people
of Virginia ar® attempting to, avoid,
QUESTION:

Mr. Kulp, isn’t another very important

reason for confidentiality that you want to be able to persuade
the judge to resign before th© matter becomes public.
MR. KULP;

I don't think ther® is any question

about that, Mr. Justice Stevens.

That has been certainly the

practice is. California., particularly.

They make a report’, and

thay haves shown that prior to th.© time they' have ever had any
formal hearings„
But one® th® Commission ■— and I want to make that
clear.

It's the Commission that, makes a complaint against th©

judge.

The- initial complainant simply files his papers with

th© Coinrai.ssion.

investigation.

Th© Commission, at that point then males its
If they find that th© complaint is justified

or at least has merit, then they ar® the ones that do the

contacting of the judge«

So they take it over at that point.

So I would say to the Court, also in this case,
while Virginia does not normally publish the results as they
do in California about how many complaints have bean filed
and how many judges may have resigned prior to the tins® of
coming to -::na Supreme Court of Virginia, in the report, which
is the subject of this particular case, the report filed by
Landmark, the publication, they do have from Mr- Bateman, who
is one of ‘ii© members — it's page 47a of the appendis,, shows
the original news article.
did indica’3.

And it does show that Mr. Bateman

It says, when asked why only one case hacl

aver been :referred t© the Supreme Court, Bateman said — Mr,
Bateman oa.vng a member of the Commission — "Several(judges)
did resign, a number have retired or something like that."
So we know that even in Virginia, on that information, that
the Commission has had its impact.
QUESTION:

I*m not sure you have mad© the point,

but isn’t one of your strong points that the purpose of the
legislature* is to try to encourage people to com© forward to
give evidence against unfit judges and make complaints- against
them, and -chat the protection of the judge is simply a
parallel cons i dara tiosri ?
MR. KULP:

Indeed it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

In

other word::, the studies; which have been made indicata that:
tha complaints will not coma forward if you d© not ensure them

39
of confidentiality -

So, of course, that is on® of th@ whole

©3sane© of the confidentiality provision itself is to
encourage th« complaints.
QUESTION:

Whafe provisions do you have in the

Commonwealth of Virginia for the disqualification of a judge
on motion of counsel?
MRo KULPs

We; do have that, but, of course, it's at

his discretion.
QUESTION:

Discretion of the judge himself,

MR,. KULPs

Discretion of the judge, yes, sir.,

And, of course), I assume* you could, if he refused to excuse
himself, that you could file a petition for mandamus.

But,

of course, ther® you arti faced with a situation of whether there
has bean an arbitrary and capricious action on his part.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kulp, am I cox'rect that the other

side doe 3 not ohjact to the confidentiality of the lav?
MR. KULP:

I am sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I am

not -sure I follow you.
QUESTION:

Am I not correct that the petitioner

does not object to the confidentiality of the law?

It only

objects 'bo being prosecuted for publishing what they find out?
MR. KULPs

I would say that is 'their position, yes,

QUESTION:

So tli® confidentiality is out of it.

MR. KULPs

I couldn’t agree with that, sir, because

40
I think it has to be all taken together.

If it weren't for

•the violation of the confidentiality, -then there would be no
criminal prosecution in 'the first place.
Kind 31 would also lik© to say to the Court that I
think that, as I indicated,

case ax© entirely different from any case that I an: aware of
that has ever been to this Court before.

of Virginia in its opinion indicated that they had not found

case, which sought -chat this does not involve a prior

MR. KULP:
that is cns thing.

That is correct, sir.

I think that

And I think also that in the New York

first of all, that there was no guidance from Congress as to
whether there should ba any restraint on the publication of
those particular materials and it was for Congress to set the QUESTION:

MR. KULP;

Yes, sir, but I think that th® point

that I an; trying to make is that th© Court found that there
was no law which sanctioned ths prior restraint, and that was
th© issue, as I read the New York Tims case, that was bafor®
the Court..
QUESTION:

The action was not a criminal prosecution;

MR. KULP:

That6s why w© say that this is an

And when you look at it in that

context, we think that you get a different result.

We don't,

disagree, as vm have taken the position in brief, with the
New York Timas

case, a prior restraint case. As conceded by

Landmark in this case, that is not the case here.
a prior restraint.

It is not

We are talking about subsequent punishment.

And I think fcha law in regard to that is different because
while the presumption of the validity cf a statute of prior
restraint is vary hard to overcome, as tills Court in its prior
opinions have certainly indicated, it is almost a situation

42

where you can't overcome it:.

But the Court has not said

that whan you are talking in situations of subsequent punish­
ment .
QUESTION;

General Kulp, I take it you are saying

that the protection of th® judge and the protection ox the
legal sysfesm generally against, insult are secondary justifica­
tions for teis statute, that you are saying that it is
necessary to have an effective system to offer confidentiality.
Is that your submission?
MR. KULP;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

So you wouldn't contend, I take it,

then that n Virginia statute that said no one may publish s.
roport that a judge is incompetent or that he is not doing
his job right until they have filed a complaint with the
Commission and the Commission itself investigated and filed
a formal complaint —
MR. KULP;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Wouxd you defend that kind of a

i.-

tiui Supreme» Court of Virginia, as wall as the statute, has
indicated that it is merely drawn —
QUESTION:

If it was protection for the judge and

protection for the judicial system generally that was involved,
>

I would thirk yen would defend that kind of a statute.

43
MR. KULP:

No, sir.

I think the casas from this

Court have been clear in that respect, that, in other words,
a judge, as any public official, may certainly ba criticized,
the administration of justice may be criticized, and w®
don’t have any argument about that.
All w© ar© saying is, mid as the Supreme Court of
Virginia found in its opinion, it says, "Considering these
matters, w«s believe it can b© said safely without need of
hard in-court evidence that absent a requirement of confiden­
tiality, tie Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission could not
function p.coperly or discharge effectively its intended
purpose.

Thus, sanctions ar® indispensable to the suppression

of a clear and present danger posed by the premature disclosure
of the Commission's sensitive proceedings —• the imminent
impairment of the effectiveness of the Commission and the
accompanying immediate threat to the orderly administration of
justice."
So it is only as an incidental matter, I think, that
one of the reasons that the Supreme Court gave was to protect
the judge.

I don't think that —

there is a provision in the statute — and X think this
answers son® of the criticism of the statute by saying suppose
that wo had a corrupt Commission* which I find to b© an extrema
state of affairs to say that this Commission all would be
corrupt, bub assuming that they

were, for the moment, it

does provide that members of the legislature may request, and
the Commission may release the information to the legislature
when the reappointment. of a judge is to be reconsidered by fch©
legislature.

And we take the position that if the legislature

does in fact ask for the information and releases it, then
it. becomes in the public domain and it would not fall under
the strictures of this particular section for the same, reason,
X believe, that the Court was talking about in Cox Broadcasting
Company,

in other words, once the State itself releases

the information, it puts it into the public domain and there
is no right to suppress it, and w® would not intend to do it.
QUESTION:

But th® only way in which the statuta

permits 1h<[ information, to become in the public domain, is
through this legislative request.

If th® judge didn't, run

veil of secrecy on the •—
MR. KULP:

Yes, your Honor, I would have to say

under the statute that would be true.
I would like to make two further points if I may.
One is that we think that the Commission has answered the
problem which Virginia citizens have foreseen.

As I

indicated previously, for 200 years where impeachment arid
other types of removal were available, there was net a single
removal of any judge for any mental disability, any incompetence..
any malfeesanca in office.

Since 1971, when the Constitution

was enacted by the people providing for the Commission and
since the Commission was specifically then thereafter set up
by legislation in 1971, the Commission has taken action
which has been reported to the Supreme Court of Virginia,
which has been reported to thy citizens of the Commonwealth,
which has been reported by the press. One judge has been
removed from office and three other judges have, been publicly
censured for activity which has an effect on the administra­
te, on of justice.
So I would say that that is where the public
interest lies.

The public interest lies in being able to

effectively handle these types of problems.

And I think

that history shows across the country that this is precisely
why the States have gone to this procedure.
QUESTION:

If all th© participants in the procedure

48

had adhered to the statutory admonition, to confidentiality,
it would have remained confidential.
MR. KULP:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

And as I say, we ar© in sort of a dilemma hare in
certain respects because the press wants to print, confidential
ii .format:.or and on the other hand they want to protect the
confidenticlity of their source.

We have asked them for ths

information, and they won't give us the names.
QUESTION:

But that case isn't before us.

MR. KULP:

No, sir, it's not.

But as I say, I

think it all evolves around the same ball of wax, so to speak.
QUESTION:

That isn't unusual.

MR. KULP:

No, sir, I wouldn't say it's unusual.

I say, as 3 point out in my brief, I think it's a very untidy
way for us to be trying to run a democratic society to bs
competing cue with another on information of that nature.
I would also like to make one further comment.
QUESTION:

The press doesn't believe in tidiness,

MR. KULP:

No, sir.

does it?

I don't believe they do.

I would have to concede that.

I recognize it's not what, my personal

views might be, and I am sure they are not consistent with
Mr. Abrams' and others.

And I recognize the responsibility

and the requirements cf the First Amendment, but I think also
that even as members of this Court indicated, that there is

49

a line of responsibility, and I would certainly hope that —
I Know, fo:r example, in California Judge Neely said that
they have had the understanding of the press out there and
they don't print this information»
I would like to make one further point, if I may,
and it's at the way in which this information is obtained.
Now, the record in this case, and it was found by the
Supreme Court of Virginia, does not show exactly how the
press firs*’ got the information.

It doesn’t show whether they

went into private Commission files or some other way.

And

I don't really indicate, and I don't really think that, the
press did that.
QUESTION:

Which doesn't make any difference,

MR. KULP:

No, sir, but I think, though —■ the

does it?

point I am trying to make, Mr. Chief Justice, is that here we
have a situation in the article itself which was published
and is in -die appendix on page 47a shows that once they got
this initial information, they went around to the Commission
members, they went around to purported witnesses, they want
around to rha judge himself and attempted to cajole out of
them information which they say that the State has

at least

I take it they are saying the State has — a right to keep
i

confidential.

I sse the position of the newspaper as saying,

"Well, if we can get it, teat's one thing.

It's all right

50
for you to try to keep it coafid@2n.tial, but if w© can get it,
then it's all right for us to publish it."

had I submit

that that, just flies in the face of what wa think of as
civilized society.

Wa say on tha one hand that the Government

cannot go about inducing innocent people to coromit crimes,
such as entrapment, for example, but here in this eas<a, and
the article shows in fact they tried to do it, tried to get
honest public citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia to
breach their confidentiality.

And o:.ia witness says, “Don't

even say that you have even talked to me, because I am not to
tell you anything."

And he didn't toll them anything.

But

apparently some did not.
QUESTION:

But even if you could show that some

newspaper reporter paid $50 or $100 to a clerk in the
Commission's office to get it, it wouldn't have any bearing
on tha iss-ia now before this Court, would it?

That's another

problem separates and distinct from this, isn't it?
MR. KULP:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know

whether it is or not, because if you draw a distinction and
say, well, if they didn't get it in an unlawful and criminal
way, that may be on© thing, but if they do, it's another
thing.

I io think there can b© a distinction drawn.
QUESTION:

Under the theory of your case, any

means of getting it is unlawful because using it is made a
criminal act by the Crmnonwsalth of Virginia.

51
MR. KULP:

Rut I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, it is

because, in other words, if the complainant and ths witnesses
and those people who are involved in the proceedings and the
Commission rules themselves, which are referred to and they
are printed in. 215 of Virginia Reports, say specifically that
they advise every participant of the confidential naturo of
the matter and that it is a crime to divulge it.

And all I

am saying is that here we have 'the press going out, attempting
to get otherwise honest citizens to breach an oath, to breach
a confidentiality, and I submit that therefore it puts it in
a different context.
And I would close by saying that I think in the
last analysis, the issue in this case is whether the peoples
of Virginia, in passing the Constitution of 1971, and their
elected officials, by enacting the statutes in question,
may constitutionally determine that certain matters of public
interest are to b& kept confidential.

Or is that decision

to fo-3 made by an unelncted and unnamed editor of some newspaper?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

This case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:35 a.m., the oral arguments in
the above-entitled matter were concluded.]
