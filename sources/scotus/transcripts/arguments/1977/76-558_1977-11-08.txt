PROCEED! N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in 76-558, Raymond Motor Transportation against Ric®.
Mr. Lederer, I think we will wait a few minutes.
I might say in the meantime, I observe that both you
and your friend are from Madison.

If you* want to get back to

Madison tonight, you will have to truncata your argument;
otherwise you will stay overnight and we will finish with you

MR, LEDERER:'

Very well, Your: Honor,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you may proceed,

Mr. Lederer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. LEDERER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEDERER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

tha Court:
This is a commerce clause case.

Appellant?, Raymond

Motor Transportation Company and Consolidated Freigh.tways, &r®
interstate general commodity carriers who utilize twin trailer
type vehicles in their operations.
A twin trailer vehicle is a type of truck that
consists of a truck tractor, to tha rear of which is attached
a 27-foot van, riding on the rear of the truck tractor on an
arrangement called & -fifth wheel, a turntable type arrangement.
To the rear of this 27“foot van there is attached a dolly, which

4
has a second turntable type arrangement on it, and a second
27-foot, van.

Twin trailers offer significant operating

advantages to general commodity carriers.

Because of the

ability to separate the individual vans that, make up a twin
trailer and make them into new combinations, general commodity
carriers are able to substitute -the interchanging of vans for
the unloading, sorting, and reloading of cargo which is
necessary whan conventional 55-foot semi“trailers are used.
Because the twin trailer can be operated e.a a single
unit, that is, a single van with a single tractor, twin
trailers can be used for downtown delivery and pickups, where
normally, if & general commodity carrier were using semi­
trailers in this operation he would have to unload the sandtrailer, reload the cargo into a straight truck, a short normal
truck' without a semi-trailer, to operate in a downtown area.
QUESTION:

But do you have them in the regular —

do you mean they operate throughout the city, these double
trsilers?
MR. LEDERER:

That is correct.

What happens is

the —
QUESTION: Well, what do the cars do, just run up on

Oh.

I thought you said —
What you have, than is a short unit.

Oh, I thought you s&id you had both of

them going through there.
MR. LEDERER:
QUESTION :

Because I wanted to stay away from that.

town,?
[Laughter. ]
MR. LEDERER:

Rut, by being able to use that type

unit, carriers are able to use the same equipment that they
use for long-disfcanca operation in a downtown city? they do not
have to purchase and use a different type of equipment.
QUESTION:

Well, where is the transition made?

You'»* not saying that your ,6.E-foot rig runs only on the
Interstates, are you?
MR. LEDERER:
QUKSTION:
MR. LEDERER:

Substantially ~
W©11, l mean —
Not only, no. The general commodity

carriers have terminals, where these units would be broken
down, where cargo would be loaded into them, unloaded, and so
forth. These terminals are normally located qui te no nr the
Interstate Highways.

Ia th© case of Wisconsin, wfearss we've

6

requested permission from the State to use the Interstate
Highways# Raymond Motor Transportation, has no terminals in the
State, made no request other than the Interstate Highways?
Consolidated has two terminals , one is located approximately
one mile from the Interstate Highway in Milwaukee, the other
is located approximately four miles from the Interstate Highway
in Madison.

Both are down four-lane divided highways.

They requested authority to operate from the Inter­
state to those terminals.

But. that would be ths extant of

their operation in the State, as a 65-foot twin trailer.
QUESTION;

So the extent of your claim la to operate

your 65-foot rig as such only on four-laws limited-recess
highways?
MR. LEDERER:

Only on specific Interstate Highways

in the. State of Wisconsin, plus the very limited one-mil© and
four-mile additional operation from the Interstate Highway
to the terminal.
QUESTIONj Well, but then it is more than my question,
as I

when you say the one-mile and the four-rail©»

It's not

just strictly confined to Interstates?
MR. LEDERER:

That's correct.

That*a correct.

It is in the case of Raymond.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, do many States have this

bar on the use of twin trailers?
MR. LEDERER: There are approximately 12 States, plus

7
Wisconsin, which baa twin trailers.

All of the States which

ban twin trailers*.- with the exception of Wisconsin, are
located on the Eastern. Seaboard.
QUESTIONS

Welly I know I hadn’t seen meny rigs

like this on highways in this area*
MR. LEDERER:

There is —* in the Appendix there is

a. map which shows which States permit them and which do not.
QUESTIONs

Well, I’ve seen them.,, it was? either in

upstate New York or some place up in ‘that area,
MR. LEDERER:

New York permits twin trailers on

the thruways in New York; Massachusetts also permits' them on
tlie Turnpikes in Massachusetts.
QUESTION:

Yes, I thought I had seen them.

QUESTION:

Mr» Lederer, while you’re interrupted,

is there an exception in the State of Wisconsin from Tomah
I

west to La Cross© and to the Twin Cities?
MR. LEDERER:

Are you --

I am familiar with that area; there is

not an exception.
QUESTION;
the papers.

I had the other impression from reading

I must have misinterpreted it.

MR® LEDERER:

There is not. Wisconsin does have a

number of exemptions to its general vehicle limit, wide
exemptions, wide number.
usaga in the. Sts.^i

The only exemption for twin trailer

- 7 Wisconsin is a permit; which is granted

to a Wisconsin manufacturer of these vehicles.

8

QUESTION*

I understsuuri that. So ther© la no

©xemption for spacified highways, that; you know ©f # specifically
from Tomah west?
MRo LEDERER:

There is no existing exemption, no.

The legal issues in this ass® arcs two.

The first

question is whether Wisconsin's ban constitutes an undue burclan

on interstate commereo, which cannot be justified by a legiti­
mate local purpose.

The second question is whethar or not

Wisconsin’s entire regulatory scheme is discriminatory.
Both those questions in large part depend on a single
factual issue:

whether or not twin trailers are safe? or

unsafe.
Iff in fact, twin trailers &r® safe, as the conven­
tional semi-trailer units which Wisconsin permits or its high­
ways# then there is no legitimate local purpose srirvad by th®.
Wisconsin ban.
If# in fact# twin trailers are safe# them the: Stats
cannot justify its discrimination against this type of vehicle#
and against interstate commerce which uses this type of
j

vehicle, on the basis of safety*
had in our opinion no criterion would 'exist, that
would permit, their to do this discrimination that they do* undcsr
that regulatory scheme*
QUESTION*,
than safety?

you recogn.i3ft any cea^idera.'liuus c-ther

How about; just aesthetic ones, that you just

9

don't cara to be, if you're driving & car, in fchs midst of
6 5- foot.- long trucks ?
MR» LEDERER:

The State was required by the district

court, in a pretrial conference, to amend its answer, -to state
in that answer all justifications that the State had for its
ban on twin trailers„

Th© State responded that its sole

justification was safety»
QUESTIONs

And you feel it's bound by that at this

point?
MR» LEDERERs

I feel th© State is bound by that»

I think — you know, tier® could foa other reasons that might
fo® imagined»

Most of those were raised in this cases, or at

least were considered»

For instance, road wear»

Th© State

conceded in its s xswer that twin trailers do not caune
increased road wear, and

sore

relevent, after that concession,

testimony came into the record teat they do not increase road
wear»
3 suppose it would be possible to think of other
reasons, but I think safety certainly would be th© only local
purpose that would have a substantial enough reason that it
could justify what is «, vary great burden on.interstate

QUESTION s
matter.

Mr» L©cv~;rer, getting to a personal

When you go down these highways, like with all the

rain we've had tes last fsw days, and you pass by a trailer

10
truck with & single one# you have a pratty hard time with that
rain coming up off the road.
MR. LEDSHER;
QUESTION:

This just doubles it..

It does not- Your Honor.
Why not?

MR. LEDBRERs

There's & technical explanation# but

I suppose the short, answer is that there is 20 porcout loss
splash and spray with a twin trailer than with & semi-trailer.
The principal reason for that is the splash and Spray which
you see coming at your vehicle# a large part of it originated
from the tandem drive axl© of & semi.

Thera are twc axles

that ars located quit© close to each. other# the wheals are
rotating and spraying water at each other# where they hit#
break up and spread out in the mist that's common with
trucksc

That's located both at the tractor and at the rear

of the semi**trailer»

With the twin trailer, there era no

tandem axles«
QUESTION:

If Virginia passes a rule and lets then

have them# I'l be, glad to think of that while I’m fighting
that rain coming,
Iv:R. LEDERER:

I think on® of the things that’s very

interesting on that particular point, and the district court1,
raised that point in its discussion of safety# there's extensive
testimony on the record.

In fact# of the 11 vehicle types

wiiich were tasted# in -""ssts that were under goverr.-msat super**
vision# of 11 vehicle types, the twin trailer was the vehicle

11
that put out. the least splash and spray.

It put out its

splash and spray in a pattern that was lov/ar and not as wide
as other vehicles, and the vehicles that put out -Bit most splash
and spray *-«“
QUESTION;

Is this on the sid@s?

MR. LEDERER:
and behind.

That’s on the sides.

That’s on the sides

They measure the 'density of the splash and spray

coming out from the vehicle and from behind1h® vehicle,
QUESTIONs

Now, are you asking us«, the nine of us,

as you did the three judges on the district court, to secondguess the State of Wisconsin on all these technical matters?
MR* LEDERER:

I suppose in a sens© it could be phrased

as second*»guessing the State, but I don’t think it. is truly.
QUESTION;

Wall, let’s say, let’s change it 'then and

make it reviewing the action of the State.
MR, LEDERER:

The State advanced as the suits reason

for its justification safety*

I think certainly the burden

then fall cm appellant, plaintiff at that time, to produce
evidence to show that twin trailers arts safe*
QUESTION;

Mid you did not. persuade tho district

court?
MR. LEDERER: We did not persuade the district court
because the' district court applied & legal presumption from
prior decisiezis of thia Court in th© 1920’s and'the 19 309 s,
to the effect that longer vehicl&a ©re larger vehicles, that

12
vehicle size is inherently tied to safety.
That presumption, 1 think, is completely rebutted by
the evidence in this case.

It's a difficult presumption to

rebut, because it has the semblance of reascxiafclen.ess to it.
I think people automaticalXy assume that a larger truck will,
per se, be a less safe truck.

The type of trucks that we*rs

talking about here, though, are a substantially physically
different piece of equipment than the semi-*trailer truck that
you’re used to,

I say "used to” because they am the most

common trucks that you sea on the highways around here.
QUESTION 5

Mr. Ledejfar, you mentioned earlier that

there is somewhere in bars a map showing what States have this
and what haven’t.

I remember that from reading thesw briefs

some time ago, but I can’t find it now.
MR. LEDERBRs

I believe it’s at page 27tf of the

Appendix, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Thank you very much.

QUESTIONS
aspect; of tha safety.

Now, you’vw been speaking of just one
What about the problem of passing?

Doss passing on the road, if anyone wants to violate the law
sufficiently to pass on© of these trucks, introduce a greater
element of risk in crowded high-speed traffic?
MR. LE DE RE R s

It does not, or, if it does not, the

opinion of numerous experts — these were loth professional
engineers and civil.engineers, plus State officials from the

13
States of Minnaseta, Kansas, and other States who had experi­
ence with twin trailers — uniformly testified that the
additional length would cause no passing problems,

We're

dealing with an Interstate Highway, or a four-lan-* divided
highway, where all the traffic is going in the same direction.
There's no fear that a car is going to coma down in the same
lane in which you’re passing.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but even if you're passing in the

left of two lanes, both going the same direction, don't lots
of people prefer not, to ha right alongside the vehicle in the
other lane?

You'd rather either

he behind him or ahead of

him.
MR® LEPURER:
QUESTION:

That’s true.
So, to -She extent that you spend time

passing him, there is -a, certain safety hazard?
MR. LEPERER:

I don’t believe that --

QUESTION: Well, if your car has a blow-out while
»
you’r.?. passing a truck, yon'r© in worse shape than if you have
& bio.-out with no other traffic around, don’t you think?
MR. REPERER:

That would be true.

At the time of

trial when Wis cons in permitted 55-foot trucks, the difference
in ti:\2i was two-thirds of a second., if you assume a 10-milepar-heur passing spe©d„
QUESTION: Well, it may not fa© much, but it's some­
thing

14
MR, LEDE RE Fu

At, th@ pressant time, Wiscoiuia has

changed its law# now permits 59-foot trucks# you’re talking
shout a matter of four-tenths of a second.
QUESTIONs Well# haw long does it take to pass
altogether?
MR, LEDERER:

It would be approximately six — I am

not sure# Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

How about jack-knifing?

MR. LEDERERs

These trucks ana far less likely bo

They are vary

conventional semi-trailer, but are substantially safer.
QUESTION:

Well# if things are so clear and things

would be so much more afficient and convenient for shippers and
consignees and ©varybody else# to what do you ascribas Wisconsin's
stubbornness?
MR. LEDERERs

I think you have a.situation where th©

original statutes which tha States passed —

which has bean in existence for a long period of idmo, th©

before twin trailers.

or length limits go bt ck long

But you’ve had a total absence of

domestic political pressure on th© State to make tht change.
That’s the result of several factors.
The first of thoss is the way general commodity rates
ara set.

They ar© set on a regional basis.

A Wisconsin

shipper does not pay a substantially higher rat© bacau.se th©
commodity carrier has more expensive transportation into, out
of, and through Wisconsin,

That rats is set on th© basis of

Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and a number of other
States,

So h@ bears no direct cost: burden, or certainly nob

Wisconsin statute creates•

MR® LEDERERs
QUESTION:

I think

I would think that would be enough of a

reason for them to allow you to b© more efficient»
MR, LEDERERs

I think there’s a second factor

there, and that is that the type of vehicle which we’re talking
about her© — excuse mss, I’m sorry.

There’s a second .factor,

in wiry thers's no domestic political pressure, and'.that’s

had a statute which was fairly simple»

II: originally

Over the years, ©very

time a domestic political group, & domestic interest, group,
something of importance to Wisconsin’s economy, has had problems!
with the length statute or the width statute or the weight
statute, they’ve been able to get an exemption.
QUESTION:

Is there some opposition in Wisconsin

to any change based on competitive factors?
MR. LEDERER:

Yes, there is.

31 think — it’s

certainly not in th© record, but local carriers in. Wisconsin
presently operate with semi-trailer equipment.

To the extant

that a carrier outside of Wisconsin operates with twin trailer
equipment, it is far less likely that he’s going to attempt to
expand his route structure? into Wisconsin and compel ,' with the
local Wisconsin carrier.
QUESTION:

You don't want us to try to evaluate

factors like that, do you?
MR. LEDERER:
should.

No, I don't think that this Court

I think *-~
QUESTION:

Even if we knew how to.

MR. LEDERER:

I think the simple question hare, and

it is a relatively simple issue, there is a substantial burden
on interstate commarce»

There is no dispute, serious dispute

in the record as to iha nature of that burden, and es to the
substance of it.

It's a sever© burden.

♦

17
If it is to be justified, it has to be justified on

the basis of safety, and the record in this case is a very
exhaustive and comprehensiva record, which shows in its
entirety that twin trailers are as safe or safer as the
conventional serai-trailers which the State permits.

In

point, of —
QUESTION;

Dess the record also show that on either

the single or the double trailer, if you've got two potanda of
pressure wrong in on© tire, by accident, you're going to have
something to happen?
MR. LEDERERs
QUESTION j

The record does not show that.
Well, you know it's true.

They have to

keep ’.hose tires absolutely perfect, with air.
MR. LEDERER:

QUESTION?

On© of the things —
And if you have a careless driver, with

one, that's one amount of damage or lack of safety? but if
you've got a careless man with two, you double the carelessness.
HR. LEDERERs

Well, Your Honor, I think that that

question — I don't know the answer to the specific question
about tiro pressures? but I think that general question is

answered in the record.

The United States Department <»f

Transportation conducted studies to d© terrain© what the actual
accident experience w.vsh twin trailers, compared to conventional
semi-vrtilers, was.

They want, to a number of commodity

carr.i-.-rs who us*' both types of -equipment and surveyed their

10
operations over a fivs-year period.
What: the summary, tine bottom line of -that, I suppose,
%

was that twin trailers suffered approximately two*» thirds or
three-quarters of the total number of accidents par .mil© of
operation that 'th© conventional semi-trailers did»
QUESTION:

Well, my point is, let’s taka th© one
to

that’s absolutely clear.

If you have a drunken driver, and

he has two, he’s going to do more damage than having on©.
MR, LEDERER;

If h© makes no attempt to maneuver

th© vehicle and no attempt 'to stop the vehicle, the answer is

QUESTION: And he’s drunk?
MR. LEDERER?

if he’s drunk, and h© makes no attempt

to stop or maneuver, th© answer is yes.

If he’s net drunk

and he; —
QUESTION:

If he is drunk and lie doss try to stop

or maneuver, he will do twice as much damage.
MR. LEDERER:

Do I understand you to say that a 65™foot truck can

MR. LEDERER;

The reason — there are about five

different reasons why Hi is is true.

QUESTION:

Are you comparing it with a 55--foot

twin trailer truck?
KRo LEDERERs

Excus© me. , sir?

QUESTION: Are you comparing the G5 with —
MR. LEDERER:

No, to a 55*-foot serai-trailer, the

type of vehicle which is permitted in Wisconsin and every other
State in tha country.

The 65-foot twin trailer compared to

a 55*»foot conventional serai-trailer.
QUESTION*

What's Hie status under Wisconsin law

of th® 55-foot twin trailer?
X

MR. LEDERER:

It is prohibited by exactly the same

administrative regulation which prohibits the 65-foot twin
trailer.

That administrative regulation prohibits twin

trailers of any length, from one foot to 100 feet.
Wisconsin, by statute, empowered the Highway
Commission to grant permits for twin trailers up to 100 feet
in length -- trailer trains is the phrase which Wisconsin uses.
The Highway Commission passed an administrative regulation
which said it would grant those permits only for vehicles used
for municipal refuse and only for vehicles in transit from
manufacturer to dealer or for repair.
In regard to the braking of the 55-foot semi-trailer
end the 65-foot twin trailer, those vests ar© in th© record.
Ana, in point of fact, those tasts show that tli® S5-foot 'twin

21
trailer whan more heavily laden than the 55-foot — than a
semi-trailer type vehicles. X don't know that it was a 55-foot,
but a semi-trailer type vehicle, the twin trailer was able to
stop in a shorter length of road.
That was true both on ica end snow and on a dry
pavement*
QUESTION:

Mr* Ledsrer, are yon going to get to th.s

— a little more deeply into the exemptions as distinguished
from the safety features of the case?
MR* LEDERER:

Yes, Your Honor*

I think the

exemptions are important in part, because of the question
which Mr* Justice Whits raised, which is why thers is no
✓

domestic political pressure in Wisconsin to permit; this types
of vehicle*
Wisconsin, over the years, has respond©*.! to its
local interest wherever the Wisconsin vehicle limits have
constricted or restrained or created problems for Wisconsin
industry, and Wisconsin has granted them a permit to us© a
longer vehicle.

They have — over the years this has become

— tsh© exemptions almost swallow the rules*

I believe over

a thrae-year period where there was .record In thin case as to
number of exemptions granted, Wisconsin granted over 40,001
exemptions which were general or annual ©saaxoptioiui*

‘That is,

not a single-trip ©xamption, but sa exemption that would apply
to. a. vehicle for an entire year and would ba only restricted

22

as to mileage or us@«

Over a threa-ys&r period there would

hav© been over 40#000 of those.
QUESTION:

What range are they?

Aren't they

categorized# at least under the regulation?
MR, LEDERER;

The regulation. —

There are numerous types.

Probably

on® of the largest usage is auto transporters# car carriers.
They are permitted to run 55-foot long trucks in Wisconsin.

deliver to a plant in 65-foot trailers, although the plant
could export in 65-foot, trailers?
MR, LEDS PER:

That's righto

Assuming that we could

get an industrial intarplant permit, to export — well, th©
plant could export, we could not, deliver; that is correct.

QUESTIONS All right.
MR. LEDERERi

The Wisconsin ragulatory scheme,

this scheme of exemptions is discriminatory, but :Lt*s not
discriminatory on its face.

Wisconsin, in general, with the

exception of the industrial iaterpl&nt permits, does not make
its exemptions applicable solely to Wisconsin industries.
Instead, what Wisconsin has don© is taken those industries
important to the Stats, whether it b« milk production, pulpwood,
automobile manufacturing, agricultural machinery, and has
granted to those industries an exemption.

An out-*of-State

agricultural machinery manufactuer could use the exemption,
too.

But by tailoring these exemptions to Wisconsin5s needs,

what has resulted is a discrimination of effect, not on the
face.
I*d appreciate it if I could reserve the rust of my
time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,

Mr* Harriman.

Very briefly, end we'll get bad'-: to the subject of
safety, but the safety aspect is, 1 think, obviously the on®
that has chiefly .concerned Wisconsin residents.

And it isn't

& scientific concern based upon lots and lots of sc* jn -ific
tests,

such as w© have in this case; it's the react:Lon of the

general public, the general driver, who writes to his
Legislator and says, "I'm afraid of these; don't let them into
our State".
Now, we had the testimony of the Chairman of our
Stats Highway Commission.

His testimony is set forth in the

Appendix at the end of our brief, and h© explained that h©
had bsen in the L@gisla.tur® and h© had seem these Xctotors, and
h© was aware of the public's reaction and fright over them#
And then, as Chairman of the Highway Commission, he said that
"Out here w© do as the Legislature directs*, and we know that
the Leg.l.slature has failed to pass several laws allowing these
longer trailers, trucks, vehicles#

And, consequently, we

know what we're expected to do out here.
And I asked him from his own experience,, and his
statement was i

Now, that’s the reason that the law hasn’t, been
changed in our State» The people have told their Legislators
they don’t want it changed, that they are afraid of these
vehicles»

had I say, no one claims that this is based on any

scientific studies? this is people, driving on the highway,
worried about what they sea, and afraid of big truck.'»
And that’s

as I understand it, that’s the basis

for the- fact that our law has not bean changed.
QUESTIONs

Aren’t they similarly afraid of the big

trucks from Wisconsin plants?
MR» KARRIMANs

They haven’t ~~ as far as I know,

•they haven’t told their Legislators that.

QUESTION:

I suppose that has less impact, because

it isn’t as pervasive throughout the State? is that true?
MR. KARRIMANj

Wall, that’s what I'm thinking, and

I’ll get into this a little further.
OnQ of the principal us©s of longer vehicles is
T

made by American Motors hauling car bodies from Milwaukee to

27
their assembly plant at Kenosha.

I understand that’s about

45 miles, and they do haul lots and lots of car bodies? and
they are big, long vehicles.
Now, that, as far as I know, is 'die only place they
haul these car bodies, just on that on© route, 45 mils;3 long.
QUESTIONS

How long ar© those trucks?

MR. KARRIMAN s
QUESTION :

Over-all.

I think they are over 55 foot..

Over 65?

MR. HARM MAN s

Yes, they are fairly long.

I think —

as I remember, about, «— they may not; all be the s«me, but
they are about 70.
QUESTION:

A maximum, though, of close to 70 feet?

MR. IIARRIMANs

I think close to 70, yes,,

relatively high, 'the dispersal throughout the State

So that by sticking on© out over th© cals, and by
obtaining a 65-foot length, they are able to haul seven

Now, why this special exemption was given to the
