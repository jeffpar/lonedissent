ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL Wc MURPHY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MURPHYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Thase cases present the question of whether foreign
governments may sue for treble damages under our antitrust
laws.
More precisely, the question is

2

Did Congress intend

to include the sovereign governments of foreign nations among
those "persons” for whom it create a. treble damage remedy in
the Sherman Act?
There are three cases hare which ware consolidated
for appeal.

They are part of the so-called antibiotic antitrusl

litigation which, at one time, consisted of upwards of 160
damage esses.
The plaintiffs, respondents here are the Imperial
Government of Iran, the Government of India, the Republic of
the Philippines.
The principal allegations in their complaints are

4
the same* each of 'them alleges that: the defendants fixed
prices end otherwise suppressed competition in. the manufacture
and sale of certain antibiotic dz*ugs in the United States and
abroad»

Each of them alleges that it

purchased antibioti.cs

which were exported from the United States»

Each of -them

alleges that it sues on behalf of various classes, one of which
is described as all individual consumers within the respective
country»

And finally, each of them alleges that it is an

independent sovereign nation»
The issues was raised in the district court on motions'
addressed to the pleadings»

The district court decided that

foreign nations may maintain treble damages, resting its
decision primarily on the judge’s perception that that was
necessary, as he put it, to the effective enforcement of. the
antitrust laws.
His decision was certified for immediate appeal, and a
panel of the Eighth Circuit affirmed»

The panel did not rest

its decision on the same ground the district court had, but,
instead, relied principally on this Court’s decision in Georgia
V»

Evans, holding that States are persons for treble-damage

purposes»
One member of the panel filed a concurring opinion,
in which he observed that, in his view. Congress had had no.
intent on this question whatsoever? that he thought the result
was dictated by this Court’s Georgia v» Evans decision, but he

5
recommended that Congress should examine the questi.on and
clarify it.
Thera was a rehearing en banc, after which six of the
eight active judges of the Eighth Circuit adopted the panel's
opinion? three of those six also adopting the concurring
opinion. There were two dissents.

The dissenters relied on

the Court's decision in United States v. Cooper, in which it.
was held that the United States is not a person.

And tha

dissenters observed that in their opinion, it would be anomalous
to hold that the United States cculd not sue for treble damages,,
but a foreign sovereign

could.

I think it fair to say that neither the district
court nor the Court of Appeals made an independent examination
of the legislative history? instead they looked entirely to
12»is Court’s two decisions which 1 have mentioned for guidance.
Now, if the. Court please, ws have a straight-forward
question of congressional intention here..

There's no issue in

this case about whether a foreign nation may sue in United
States courts if it has a, proper claim.
The question is s

Of course it can.

Did these foreign nations have the claim

they pleaded?
And that, in turn, depends upon whether Congress
gave it to them.
New, our argument begins with tha language of the
statute, which confers the treble—damage remedy on any person

6

who shall be .injured by reason of a violation, and so forth»
It’s our contention that that language, just read in
its ordinary and natural sense, would not be taken to include
sovereign governments, and w© have cited in our brief three
decisions by this Court in which the Court made a similar
observation- the Fox case in IS76, the Cooper case itself, and
United Mine Workers, in 330 United States»
Nov/, if the Court please, we believe that there is
evidence here, developed at some length in our briefs, that
Congress in 1390 had a pretty clear understanding of the
term "person", and a pretty clear understanding of what that
meant and did not mean.
One point that we rely on as such evidence is the
statute of 1371, in which Congress, as this Court's prior
opinions have said, created its own dictionary, and an amendment
in that statute, when ‘the Revised Statutes of 1874 were enacted»
The 1871 statute had defined "person" by saying that
it may extend and be applied to "bodies politic" and corpora­
tions, unless the context indicates a more limited meaning.
When the revisers of the statutes submitted their
report to Congress, they suggested that the phrase "bodies
politic" be deleted, on the ground that it introduced an
unnecessary ambiguity, and that with that ambiguity it might
be -thought in future statutes necessary expressly to exclude,
governmental entities»

For that purpose, the phrase was

7
deleted from the definitional statute when it was re-enacted
in 1874, so that it read, than, and at the time of the Sherman
Act and now, that the word "person" may extend and be applied
to corporations and associations, unless the context indicates
a more limited meaning*
We have cited in our brief evidence that Senators
who were the principal draftsmen of the Sherman Act ware
familiar with that little bit of legislative history, specifi­
cally Senators Edmunds and Hoar»
And when those Senators wrote their definition in
the Sherman Act, they nailed down the fact that
include corporations.

"person" must

That is to say, the 1874 statute mad®

it allowable, "'parson5 may extend", but in Section 8 of the
Sherman Act it is written, "'person5 shall be deemed to
include corporations®.
Now, v;hen Senator Edmunds introduced the Sherman -Act
on the Floor of the Senate, he said that the legislation is
clear in its terms and definite in its definitions.

The

definition of "person" is the only one in the Sherman Act»
And we submit that as a matter of logical construction
if tli© Congress, in the light of the change in the definitional
statute, thought it necessary expressly to include corporations,
which might have been included as a matter of discretion in any
©vent, it must follow that they had no intention whatever to
include sovereign governments c

8
QUESTION:
require

Mr. Murphy , would not: your argument;

us to overrule Georgia v. Evans?
MR. MURPHYs

No* Justice Stevens* we don't think sc.

In the terms of the problem we're discussing, we submit that,
first, Georgia «as not really a sovereign? Georgia was not
able to exercise sovereignty over- the problem it was faced with*
a combination and restraint, of interstate trade.
QUESTION;

No, but was it a corporation' or a parson

as defined in Section 8 of the Sherman Act?
MR. MURPHY;

No, my argument, Justice Stevens, is

not that the definitional statutes are conclusive; our argument
is that they are vary weighty evidence of what Congress intended
and that it should take a fairly clear expression of
congressional purpose to read a government into that word.
Now, in the Georgia case, I think there is evidence
that the Suprema Court intended to include Georgia, and the
other States.

One of the problems that Congress was dealing

with in the Sherman Act was the inability of States to reach
combinations and trusts. Senator Sherman used as an example,
to illustrate the need for the statute, the inability of the
Stata of New York to reach the sugar trust, because its members
were beyond tie then territorial jurisdiction of the State of
New York, so that Congress had vary much in mind and, we submit,
intended to create a remedy for limited State jurisdiction,
which was involved in the Georgia case.

9
QUESTION: Do you see any constitutional objection,
counsel, to having the United States, if it elected to enter
into conventions or treaties with certain countries, of granting
them the rights the Eighth Circuit has given here, granting it
by treaty or convention, either on a reciprocal basis or for
any reason that the Executive Branch and the Congress agreed on?
MR. MURPHY:

No, sir, I don't believe I do0

And I

don't see any reason why Congress, had it 'thought it desirable
to do so, or if it should think it desirable to do so now,
couldn't legislate that result.
QUESTION:

In other words, if other countries didn't

grant the same rights to the United States, then we could
deny it to "them?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, sir.

It seems to me that one of the very strong points in
our position in just an ordinary practical sort of way is it
simply is improbable that a Congress which intended to exclude
the United Statos from the treble-”damage remedy, as the Cooper
case decided it did, could have intended to give that remedy
to a foreign sovereign.

Because the interests of the United

States Government are closely associated, perhaps indistinguish­
able from those of the American public, for whose protection
the antitrust laws were passed? whereas the interests of
foreign sovereigns may, and frequently are, divergent and, on
occasion, opposed to those interests.

10

And following along on that, line of thought, it s©sms
to me more than just improbable, but highly unlikely, that a
Congress with that sort of intention might, have intended to
recruit foreign sovereigns to assist in the enforcement of our
antitrust laws? which was the basis for ‘the district court’s
decision and, as I read it, is essentially the argument which
the Department of Justice has made in its amicus brief»
QUESTION;

Particularly, I suppose, with the situation

of 1890, racruting the Kingdom of Span, with whom we were going
to go to wart sight years later, end the Uni tad Kingdom, with
whom we had almost gone to war twenty years before over the
Alabama claim,
MR. MURPHY;

Exactly, sir.

The speeches of the Congressmen who were prominent
in this legislation at that time, which we have cited in our
briefs, I think make it very clear that what they were
interested in doing was protecting domestic consumers, protect"
ing the domestic market, and they had no interest whatever in
protecting foreign governments.
In short, if the Court pleas®, it appears to us that
there is ampla evidence in the legislative history of a
congressional intent not to make the treble-damage remedy
available to foreign nations, whereas it seems to us there is
evidence in tie legislative history of an intent to make it
available to State governments.

11

Mow , the decision of the Eighth Circuit at least,
we suggest,, brings about a peculiar result, peculiar in the
sense that it gives, for example, the Imperial Government of
Iran a right to sus for treble damages, when -the United States
Government now can sue only for actual damages.
We submit that an intent to bring about that result
ought not be imputed to Congress without some very clear and
strong evidence that that's what it intended to do.
QUESTION:

Would it

have included North Vietnam

during the recent hostilities, while those hosti.li.ties were
on-going?
MR. MURPHY: Well, Your Honor, on© of the difficulties
with tee Eighth Circuit's result is it confers the remedy on
a foreign nation, whether it's friend or foe.
Now, I’m sure teat reasons could be thought of to
keep tee Government of North Vietnam out of court while
hostilities ware going on, out perhaps not.

And any government

in tee world will be entitled to sue, unless the Eighth
Circuit is reversed? and we ask that the Court do so.
QUESTION:

Well, nothing would have prevented the

Norte Vietnamese from hiring American lawyers to bring such a
lawsuit, would it?
MR. MURPHY: Well, indeed, Your Honor, on© of tee
complications

we had in this litigation was on© of the original

foreign government plaintiffs was tee Republic of Vietnam.

12
Arid In the midst; of the litigation that government
disappeared, was swallowed up, in my view, by North Vietnam,
and the question was presented:

should the Vietnam case be

dismissed or suspended?
Nov, there was counsel in court for Vietnam, whatever
Vietnam was at that time, trying to keep his case alive»
The district court and the Eighth Circuit held that it should
be dismissed»
QUESTION:

In other words, a suit of this kind is not

barred under the Eighth Circuit opinion if we either have
broken off diplomatic relations or have no.diplomatic relations
for any reason, they can still sue?
MR» MURPHY: Well, if we have no diplomatic relations
at all, Mr. Chief Justice, it may be that our courts would not
recognize that government as an entity which would be entitled
to s ue»
QUESTION:

Well, recognition of the government as

such and the presence of diplomatic representatives are not
always exactly 'She same.
MR. MURPIIY: Quite so, sir»
QUESTION:

Mr. Murphy, are any of the petitioning

companies in this case subject to the jurisdiction of
respondent countries?
MR. MURPHY:

I believe so, Justice Powell.

Plaintiffs

allege in their complaints, each of the plaintiffs allege in

13
its complaint, that all five of the petitioning companies are
engaged in the pharmaceutical business within those countries»
QUESTION:

Do any of those countries have the

approximate equivalent of our antitrust laws?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, sir, they do» We. have cited them

in our briefs»
QUESTION;

Have any suits been brought in those

countries against these particular United States companies?
MR» MURPHY;

Not to my knowledge.

We have pointed

out in our briefs that the Government of West Germany, which
has filed amicus, has commenced an investigation under its
equivalent of the anti-trust laws against one of the petitioning
companies.

A copy of -that

latter has been lodged with the

Court.
QUESTION s

Is there any evidence that the United

States Government would have reciprocal rights to sue in any
of these countries?
MR.

murphy•

There is no evidence in this record and

I’m not sufficiently familiar with the laws of those countries
to answer the question.

with, the Court's permission, I’d like to reserve time
for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr.

Rig lex*.

Very well, Mr. Murphy.

14
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS V. RIGLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RIGLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
There are at least five compelling reasons for

con­

cluding that Congress intended foreign governments to have
standing to obtain relief when they are the victims of anti­
trust violations launched at them from within the United States.
Conversely, there is no reason to suppose that
Congress intended to create an area of damage-free conspiracy
so that Amarican companies could prey on friendly foreign
governments engaged in making purchases to satisfy their needs
in this country.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any special significance

to your use of the adjective ‘’friendly"?
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:
MR. RIGLER:

No, there is not, Your Honor.
What about Cuba, could Cuba or —
Turning to one of the questions -that

was just raised, it is our view that without diplomatic
relations, a foreign government’s right to enter the courts of
this .country would be governed by rules of comity, and that
they would not have that privilege extended to them.

It. is a

K

reciprocal privilege based on comity.
Indeed, this Court said, in Cuba v. Sabbatino, —
QUESTION; Taiwan could bring a suit, but. the other,

15

Chinay could not? is that your suggestion?
MR. RIGLER:

That is ray suggestion.; Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION: Doesn't that bring the courts pretty close
to getting involved in political questions of the highest
magnitude?
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.
To make decisions of that kind?

MR. RIGLER:

I believe the test would be very simple.

That is, whether or not we had diplomatic relations with the
foreign government.

I don't believe that any extensive

judicial determination would be required.
QUESTION: Do you agree with Mr. Murphy that the
United States could enter into conventions or treaties with
other countries, granting those sovereigns the right to sus for
treble damages if we had the same right in their courts?
MR. RIGLER:

Well, it’s our position, Mr. Chief

Justl.ce, that the right for foreign governments to sue here
is already established.

So that there would be no necessity

for such a treaty.
However, we have entered into treaties with countries,
such as West Germany, which brought their treaty to your
attention in their amicus brief.
QUESTION:

Well, there would be nothing to prevent

•the Congress of the United States from — if the Eighth Circuit

opinion should stand,nothing would prevent the Congress from
clarifying it so that that right to sue for treble damages
did not exist, and then do you see any problem about,
negotiating treaties or conventions with reciprocity?
MRo RIGLER:

If the Eighth Circuit opinion is affirmed,

there would ha no problem in the Congress entering into
additional treaties or approving additional treatd.es to specify
the mechanics as to how those rights might be gained or
ampli fiad.
Indeed, however, our State Department, through the
Secretary, has appeared, as we note in our brief, repeatedly,
urging other countries to adopt our antitrust principles. And
one of the points we would make is that it is simply incompre­
hensible that we could go urge other countries to adopt our
philosophy and throw them out of our own courts when they're
over here to seek redress for antitrust —
QUESTION:

The Secretary of State, in 1890.. wasn’t

wandering around the world urging other countries to adopt
the

Sherman Act, was he?
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:

Not to my knowledge, Mr. Rehnquist.
And isn't that the time we take

congressional intent as of?
MR. RIGLER:

Yes, it is.

However, among the five

compelling reasons, which I hops to cite, we do com© to the
point, 'that Congress intended foreign governments to be

17
included in 1890»

I disagree very strongly with defendants'

argument that that was not the intent of Congress in 1890,
QUESTION:

But how does the conduct of the Attorney

General in recent years, in urging other countries to adopt cur
antitrust principles, bear on the intent of Congress in 1890?
MR, RIGLER:

Tha recent conduct of the Attorney

General surely could not bear on the intent of Congress in 1890,
QUESTION: What policy considerations — let me back
up a little.

Of necessity, your argument must be that Congress

intended this result that the Eighth Circuit reached.

I take

it that's the premise of your whole case.
MR. RIGLER: Certainly that is a principal one, Mr.
Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

What policy considerations would compel

the Congress of the United States to grant to a foreign —
other sovereign nations rights which it did not grant to the
United States itself?
MR. RIGLER: Well, principles of comity, plus the
fact that not only were these rights granted to —
QUESTION:

Well, comity is usually something like

reciprocity, isn't it?
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:
MR. RIGLER;

Yss, sir.
There's no reciprocity in my hypothetical.
All right.

With respect to the Cooper

case, which is the case denying those rights to the United

18

States itself, the Cooper result was a direct and a deliberate
congressional intent not to extend the damage remedy to the
United States, and that deliberate intent was explicitly
stated by Senator Sherman, who stated that the damage remedy
was not to extend to the United States at all»
That appears on page 2461 and again on 246 3 of 21
Congressional Record»
Senator Sherman was at pains to distinguish between
the first section of his bill, which allowed the United States
alternate remedies, criminal remedies, injunctive remedies,
seizure remedies, and he said that these remedies were made
available for the U„S0

It turned upon the perceived obliga­

tions of the sovereign to enforce its own laws without
reference to tee added stimulus of the damage remedy»
Then, having distinguished the remedy made available
solely to the U»S. , he said that the damage remedy was to be
made available to all other parties, as he put it.

So teat

the Cooper result is a direct reflection of the intent of the
sponsors of the bill.
All other parties were to have the benefit of the
bill»

Moreover, the treble-damage remedy has been extended to

persons, to States, yto foreign corporations. And since this
Court has said, in DunbJJ.i, that whan a foreign nation enters
this country in a commercial capacity, it is to be treated the
same as every other trader, subject to th© same strictures of

19

the nia.rk6tp.laca» subject to the same penalties of the market­
places» it would be very unfair then to deny them any remedy
when they are mulcted» as the Court 3aid in Georgia» by a
violator of the -anti.trust laws*
QUESTION:

Mr. Rigler, you started out by telling us

that there are at least five compelling reasons why your
position is correcto
MR» RIGLER:

Yes» sir.

QUESTION: And I am sure» by our interrogation» we
have gotten you to give us probably all the reasons» but not
in one» two» .three» four five? I'd b® interested to have -that*
MR. RIGLER:

I am not sure that I have covered them»

but I will ctsar them briefly» Hr. Justice Stow arte.
First» in 1890» Congress was aware of -the prevailing
canon and general rule that a sovereign» a foreign government
may take advantage of a gexier&l remedial statute, whether or
not it is named as a person» for purposes of that statute.
Second, in Georgia v. Evans, this Court recognised
that governments were included as "persons'* within the meaning
of tli© Sherman Act.

The rationale of that decision that these

governments, notwithstanding their sovereignty within their
own territory» within their own area of sovereignty, might
have their own antitrust statutes? nonetheless, they would be
denied any effective relief without reference to the federal
statute

20

Third,, in both Cooper and in Georgia» this Court set
forth five aids to construction»

With reference to each of

those five aids» we satisfy the test end should be granted
standing»
Fourth» an anomaly would be created by extending
the right to foreign corporations which are 100 percent owned
by foreign governments and then denying that same standard to
the government itself in making its direct purchases»

We

noted» coincidentally» that this would favor the Eastern Bloc
nations» the Socialist and Communist Bloc nations» which carry
out more of their trading through the mechanism of the State
Trading Corporation» and would disfavor our traditional Western
Allies who are more apt to purchase directly.
QUESTION: With foreign corporations» though» at
least it's a wholly owned by the government — at least it's a
two-way street»

They are suable as well as capable of being

sued under your analysis» I think.
MR. RIGLER; The fifth reason I was about to come to»
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, was Dunhill»

which I had mentioned

previously» and it seems to us that tha government itself may
b® suable» as you put it, under the principles enunciated
in Dunhill.
QUESTION %

So your feeling is that if your position

were adopted» not only could the government of Iran, sue for
treble damages, but it could be sued in the courts of this

21
country for treble damages?
MR, RIGLERs For its commercial activities, 1 believe
that tliis Court has stated that rule,

And indeed, since the

Court stated that rule, it has been incorporated in the foreign
sovereign immunity statute,
QUESTION: But we haven't yet decided whether or not
a municipality of the United States is covered by the anti­
trust laws as a defendant, let alone whether or not & foreign
nation is,
MR. R1GLER;

I'm not —

QUESTION j W© heard a case argued last year ~~
MR. RIGLERs

I heard the City of Lafayette argument,

if it*s that to which you refer, sir.
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. RIGLERs

However, it seems to me that it's clear

that a foreign government is subject, both under the Dunhill
rationale and rule announced by this Court and under the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that, for its commercial
activities, it would be subject to our laws,
3y she way, it's interesting to note that in the
House Report on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, a
"commercial activity" was defined as "the purchase by the
armed services of a foreign government of goods and commodities
in this country"j and of course some of the very purchases for
which wo are attempting to recover are purchases of medicines,

22
of antibiotics bought for the armed services of the Philippines,,
among other governments.
QUESTION s

Is there anything in 1890 that mentioned,

foreign governments?
MR. RIGLERs

There is.. Mr. Justice Marshall.

In responding to a question about fee constitutional foundation
of his bill, Senator Sherman referred to Article III, Section
2, and pointed out that this was — that this gave the
federal courts wide latitude to resolve disputes? and then he
enumerated fee type of disputas.

And as one of those disputes

h© enumerated disputas between citizens of this country and
fee foreign nations.
And it seems to us inconceivable that on fee one
hand he would say, "Here is a constitutional basis for ray
bill, this among others", and yet turn around and say "But
they are not ho receive the benefits
QUESTION:

of a damage remedy."

Is there anything feat Senator Sherman

said, other than "I want to protect fee American people"?
Didn't he say feat over and over again?
MR. RIGLERi
QUESTION:

No, he did not, as a matter of fact.
He

said he was protecting foreign

He did not say specifically "foreign

However, he referred — he did not ~~ Senator

It said "persons".
It said "persons" included —
And when it said "parsons", that

included corporations, because this Court had already s&id
that corporations were included in the word "persons" in the
Fourteenth Amendment,
So corporations were meant to be included.

But I

don't know who else was meant to be included in "parsons".
MR. RIGLER:

Well, surely governments were meant to

For purposes of the rationale in tills

Well, then to pursua Mr, Justice

Marshall's inquiry, why would they — why would the Congress
pinpoint foreign corporations as being included and —
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:

That is —
— almost clearly exclude any others?

Does that not exclude,

MR. RIGLER:

But —* no, because the usual rule —

that's the point I want to make, the usual rule in 1890 was
that foreign

was that sovereigns are included.

Court said so in 1893, a contemporary case.

Whether

or not — if th© definition said "parsons”, and "persons" may
included natural persons and corporations, period.
If ‘the statute said nothing more, and it is a
remedial statuta, then foreign governments, sovereigns are
entitled to th© benefits of that, statute.

And that’s exactly

what this Court said in Stanley v. Schw&lby? and I might point
out that in that instance it was the United States which was
taking advantage of -the remedy and the United States was a
foreign sovereign.

Because Stanley v. Schwa.toy was a case

under Texas lav/, and tills Court said;

Although not mentioned

by name, a remedial statute that does refer- to persons
generally, th© United States may take advantage of it.
And that rule was announced only three years different:
from the passage of th© Sherman Act.

And we have referred to

the treatises and to the authorities, specifically Black, on
statutory interpretation, the 1896 edition, which repeated
that rule.
QUESTIONi Did Stanley comment on the S.R.l, the
definition of "person" in the revised statute?
MR. RIGLER:

No, it did not.

The revised statutes,

Mr. Justice Relinquish, we do not believe support the argument
of 'the petitioners hare, for several reasons:

27

No. 1? this Court could

not have reached its result

in Georgia if the defendants were correct in their argument
about their applicability; nor could tills Court have reached
■the result it did in U«s. v, California arising under the
Shipping Act, or U. S„ v. Nardone under the Communications
Act? because they all use "persons” in approximately the same
sense? as was done in the Sherman Act.
Secondly? if you take the language? the very language,,
upon which the petitioners purport to rely? the fair and
ordinary reading indicates that Congress specifically would
have had to include governments in order to read them out of
the statute.
Let me read exactly what the Revisers said;

"It

requires the draughtsman? in tie majority of cases of employing
the word 'person*, to taka care that States? Territories?
foreign governments? et cetera, appear to be excluded."
But that is not what Senator Sherman and the other
sponsors of the bill did.
were excluded.

They took no care to see that they

They wrote a definition thefc was inclusive.

QUESTION:

But wasn’t that the draftsman's complaint

about the existing state of the lav; before S.R.l? rather than
how it would be if S.R. 1 were adopted?
MR. RIGLER:

I don't believe that that's a fair

reading of the statement.

Moreover? the draftsmen were not

to make a substantive change in the lav;.

As a matter of fact?

28

they weref in. essence, firedo And Congress — there was a
great deal of legislative history then, tc the effect, that no
substantive change was intended.

But if ~~

29
QUESTION %

Well, it’s the definition of the word

"person", that's what we’re interested in here, in a particular
statute0
MR, RIGLER:

Yes.

But although that definition did

not mention governments as such, we have seen that municipal
governments may avail themselves of the provisions of the
Sherman Act, State governments may, and, like them, we have
no effective remedy except with reference to ~~
QUESTION :

But municipal governments are corpora.-

tions, aren’t they?
MR. RIGLER: Some are, some are not.

In the

Chattanooga case, Atlanta did turn out to be a corporation.
I did not read that as the turning point of the case, however.
QUESTION:
MR. RIGLER:

Yes.
Let me comment on another argument

raised by the petitioners, namely, that in 1890 no damage
rights existed.

Remember that Sherman’s intent was to

consolidate the pre-existing remedies under the common law
and under Stata statutes in order to make them effective.
Well, as long ago as 1623, in th© English Statute
of Monopolies, -the remedy of treble damages had been extended.
And if you consult that statute you will see that among "die
people to whom that was extended was "bodies politic", i.e.,
governments.
In 1890, no less than 13 States already had anti-

30

•trust, statutes on their books , some of which provided for
damages,

Kansas being an example.
Thirdg in —
QUESTION: Did any of them explicitly provide that

a foreign nation could seek redress?
MR. RIGLER:

Mot to my knowledge, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
QUESTION:
MR. RIGLER:

Any of the State statutes is what I mean.
I understand.

No, sir.

However, you read that against Sherman’s intent,
which was to incorporate the general pro-existing rules and
fashion them into a single federal statute so that trusts
could be eliminated and so that antitrust principles would be
enhanced.
QUESTION: What do you say to the argument that your
brother makes that in 1890 there was a generalized atmosphere
of Zenophobia, or something akin to it?
MR. RIGLER: Well, if you will consult his references,
they are not to the direct legislative history of the Sherman
Act, —

31

MRo RIGLER:

But. consult the references that I gave

Mr. Justice Marshall, where Sherman is talking specifically
of foreign commerce, and the words "foreign corporations"?
how could you accommodate on the one hand Congress' extension
of the remedy explicitly to foreign corporations, with a
desire to read "foreign" out of the remedial provisions of the
antitrust lav/?
It simply can't ba done,
QUESTION: Well, except that, they didn't grant
comparable privileges or reciprocal privileges to foreign
countries at that time*
MR. RIGLER:

To?

They did not grant -- I missed

something.
QUESTION:

Most countri.es did not grant comparable

privileges to our country and remedies to our country, because
it was a new, somewhat new concept at that time*
MR. RIGLER: Well, plainly, though, the remedy of
treble damages was extended to foreign corporations, whether
©r not ?J. S. corporations could obtain comparable rights really
is of no moment, because right there in the statute' *— the
question was:

why do we assume that Congress didn't want to

read out foreign interests altogether?

.And the answer is:

because they specifically included some foreign interests,
namely, foreign corporations in the
QUESTION:

Well, could it

have been that then, as of

32

now, -that, a lot of those "foreign corporations" were owned
by Amaricans?
MR. RIGLER:
Justice Marshall.

It could have been either way, Mr.

Some were, some weren’t, quite obviously.

But the statute wouldn’t raise that distinction.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION: Well, you have to argue, I gather, that a
State is a corporation?
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:

No, indeed.
What do you argue?

MR. RIGLER: That a State is a sovereign.
QUESTION:

I know, but how is it a "person"?

MR. RIGLER: Well, actually, as a matter of fact, we
do argue that, although I don’t think that our argument rests
on that.

I agree that the

You say a foreign government is a

Is that what you say?
MR. RIGLER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And why is it a "person15?
MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:

Because it's -It certainly isn’t by any common, ordinary

definition of the word "parson".
Do you suppose that corporation would have been
included if they had naver put the definitional section in?
Had just used the word "person"?

MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:
MR* RIGLER:

Yes.

Absolutely.

Do you think & foreign state would?
Absolutely.

QUESTION: Well, is that your argument, that you
have t.o — you go directly from "parson” to "foreign state"
or do you go through "corporation"?
MR. RIGLER:

Either way«

That's

if they weren't a corporation, they would

I think that even

And so, on that count as well,

What?

No, sir.

Do you say it is or not?

Not on the face of the Act, but it *—*
On the face of the Act, if all you had

MR. RIGLER:

No* sir.

However* there was a treble

35
QUESTION;

Will you tell me again why the revised

statutes — the usual rule or the rule stated in

the revised

statutes about defining "persons"# why that isn't relevant
W

here?
MR. RIGLER: Well# it isn't relevant for several
reasons:
First# because the revisers were not entrusted with
the task of making any substantive change in the law.
Second# because the revisers# in essence# were
fired.
Third# even if you take the revisers' language#
fairly read# it supports the concept that you had to
specifically exclude a sovereign as a "person” or the
sovereign would bs included.
QUESTION;

On the face of the provision •*?-* on the

face of the provision?
MR. RIGLER:

Well# that's certainly what the

language says.
QUESTION:

Well# if Senator Sherman had bean

defeated at the election after the enactment of tie Sherman
Act, you wouldn't read the 'Sherman Act" out of the text#
would you?

They did adopt the revised statutes.

Congress

did. Evan though the revisers may have been fired.
MR. RIGLER: They did not intend to males any change
in the substantive rule.

And the remainder of my answer to

36
Mr. Justice White is that this Court simply could not have
com® out where it did in Georgia v. Evens or in U. S, v.
California or in U. S. v. Mar done,, or the other cases we cite,
if the defendants' version of the 1874 revision were correct.
QUESTION: Well, maybe that's an argument that wasn't
called to the Court's attention in those cases and perhaps
they were wrongly decided.
MR. RIGLER:

It's my recollection that the 1874

decision was called to the Court's attention, either in
Cooper or Georgia —* I would have to check that. But I believe
that to hav® bean the case from our review of the briefs.
Mr. Murphy mentioned one other case, by the way,
which is —

— a municipality had standing.

MR. RIGLER:

but they didn't — I don't believe that that was the basic
rationale of 'the decision, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTION?

Oh,, it said it would be ironic to let a

city sue and not let a State sue.
MR. RIGLERs
QUESTION s

Yes.

Didn't it?

Correct.

Mr. Riglsr, could I ask you one question

shout your argument that I didn't quite follow:
You made reference to the Statute of Monopolies -MR. RIGLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is there precedent to ts© effect that

foreign governments could sue for damages under that statute?
I thought of that statute basically as a prohibition against
grants of monopolies by the Crown.
^

How did -the damage

remedy figure in that statute?
MR, RIGLER:

Because -file statute indicated that the

remedy was available to "bodies politic".

I believe that

appears in the text of the statute itself.
QUESTION:
that statute?

Well, what remedy could it be under

That’s what I --

MR. RIGLER:

Treble damages were specifically

mentioned.
QUESTION:
|

MR. RIGLER:

For doing what?
For violating the statute. And I

believe that one of tea provisions, one of the wrongs covered
by tlie statute was the illegal assertion of a patent, monopoly,
which, of course, is one of the allegations in the very case

38
before "as here»
QUESTION;

Are there cases that hold that a foreign

government could sue — you’re just relying on the. statutory
language in that?
MR. RIGLERs
QUESTION:

On the Statute of Monopolies?
Yes.

MR. RIGLER:

Yes , sir.

I wanes:d to address the United Mine Workers case ,
which the respondents say disputes the proposition that
sovereigns may avail themselves of the language in a general
remedial statute,,

United Mina Workers stands on a different

proposition, namely,, that sovereigns may not be stripped of
pr@-existi.ng sovereign, as opposed to commercial, prerogatives,
in tiie event a subsequent statute is passed.
I mentioned among my points the anomaly.

It seems

just inconceivable to conclude that, on the purchases of
identical goods

,

say aircraft, on the on® hand Great Britain

could not recover for purchases by the Royal Air Force,
whereas British Airways, a wholly-owned government corporation,
could.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

39

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL W. MURPHY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MURPHY:

Mr» Chief Justice, just one or two

points.
These plaintiffs aren’t just corporations, they
can’t gat under this statute

by saying that.

They plead

themselves in their complaints as "independent sovereign
nations".
My brother referred to Senator Sherman's statement
that the Unitad States would be excluded from the treble­
damage remedy as evidence of an express congressional intent.
In making that statement, Senator Sherman was referring to the
|

provision in his then draft which limited the remedy to, I
think it was put, "persons damnified or injured".

There was

never, in any of Senator Sherman's drafts, any express
exclusion of -She United States, other than as may be implied
from the use of the word "person".
My brother misspoke himself twice about the amendment
of the 1871 statute and the revisers? report.

The language

lie referred to, as I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested,
was from the revisers ’ report recommending that the phrase.
^

"bodies politic" be deleted from tee statute, so teat in
future statutes it would not be necessary to exclude teem
express ly „
Neither the Cooper case nor tee Georgia case mentioned

the 1874 statute.

The Cooper case does cite -the case of

United Statas v. Fox, which was an 1876 decision of this
Court, holding that the United States was not a “parson"
within the meaning of the New York Statute of Wills, and stating
that ordinarily a statute employing the word "person" will be
construed to exclude the sovereign.
Our friends on the other side suggest that the
general rule in 1890 was that the word '’person'1 include
sovereigns.

We just flatly disagree with that. We think they

are wrong. The point is thoroughly in the briefs, and I won’t
repeat, myself.
QUESTION: Well, what do you do with — assume we
agree with you, what, do you do with Georgia v. Evans?

Just

L

confine it to

its facts and say a State is a State and a

foreign government is a foreign government?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, and I —

QUESTIONOne is a “person” and one isn’t.
MR. MURPHY:

In a practical sense, the way an 1890

Congressman would look at it, I’m sure that’s what he would
say.

He could think of all kinds of reasons why Georgia

ought to be able to sue and Iran ought not.
QUESTION:

But certainly

that case does at

least stand for the proposition that the word ’’person" can
include a quasi-sovereign Stats?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, sir, it does stand for that

41
proposition, as I said
QUESTION?
MR, MURPHY;

Ah the very leasts
As I said in answer to Justd.ce

Stevens* question, I think -that State fits our analysis for
two reasons:

One, because Georgia just didn't have sovereign

power over —
QUESTION:
MR. MURPHY:

In this area,
In this area..

And secondly, because

there is evidence in the legislative history that a reason
for the Sherman Act was the limited reach of State law,
QUESTION:

Of course, India or Iran don't have

sovereign power to do anything about illegal antitrust
)

activity in the United Statas, unless they can be plaintiffs.
I mean, they don’t have sovereign power to do it.
MR. MURPHY:

Oh, I think they clearly do, Justice

Stewart, if
QUESTION2

To enforce tee antitrust laws of the

United States?
MR. MURPHY:

No, no,

No.

They clearly have

sovereign power to deal with trade restraining combinations
which affect their commerce, either in terms of goods imported
f)

into teat country from other places or in terms of activity
within

»
QUESTION:

Well, since you were talking about the

inability or the powerlessness of a State, such as Georgia or

any other State, to enforce the agreements in restraint of
trade and. other violations of the antitrust lav/s in the
United States„
MR. MURPHY:
QUESTION:
MRs MURPHY;

Under their own laws .
Yes„
And I say that a foreign sovereign has

the ability to deal with trade restraining combinations
affecting their commerce to the same extent as does the
United States*

It has full sovereign power,,

QUESTION:

Hardly*

You don’t really mean that.

They can’t bring criminal prosecutions under the antitrust
laws *
MR. MURPHY;

Not under our antitrust laws, no, sir,

of course not.»
QUESTION;

No*

Well, that’s what I’m talking about.

Our antitrust laws.
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, we are. But the reason I feel

Georgia fits into our analysis is because Georgia, under its
laws, was powerless to reach a restraint in the interstate
commerce of the united States.
QUESTION: Well, doesn’t a foreign sovereign, whether
it's Iran or Turkey, have certain powers which the State of
Georgia or California does not hava?

Namely, they can boycott

our commerce and prevent passage, and do a great many political
things which, under our commerce clause, no state may do here.

MR* MURPHY:

Exactly»

Exactly. And that's why

there seems to us to be just all the difference, as night and
day, between the State of Georgia and the Government of
Turkey.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen*

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:48 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
