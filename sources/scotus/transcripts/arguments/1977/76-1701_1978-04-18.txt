We811 hear arguments first

this morning in Tennessee Valley Authority against Hiram G.
Hill „
Me, Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GRIFFIN
BELL, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL -

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
I appear on behalf of the government in this case.
My colleague, Mr. Daniel Friec^an, appears with me, as doss
y
Mr. Herbert S. Ganger, Jr.,/who is th© General Counsel of
the TVA.
In this unusual case, as Attorney General I agreed
that the Secretary of Interior could take a position opposite
our position in this Court.

And I*v© included—I've stated

his position in writing as an appendix to our brief.

I

understood that, this was not violating any policy of the
Court? historically, going back into the Eisenhower
Administration, on a rare occasion, this has been don®.
1 will, of cour s®, not argue the Secretary of
Interior'& position, but it is well stated, and I knew the
Court, will tak® note of it.
/

This 4rase presents a conflictJbitwaen the snail
darter, an endangered species under the Endangered Species

4
Act, and the Tellico Dam project, which is part of the TVA
system.
The Tellico Dara project is just that, a project,
a multipurpose project, designed t© free a navigable body
of water, electric power, 'industrial development, flood
control, and recreation on the Little Tennessee River.
The Little Tennessee River has its origin® in the
mountains of north Georgia; flows in a northwest direction
generally; in the Knoxville, Tennessee, araa; finally into the
Tennessee River.
There are many dams in the TVA system on the:
Tennessee River.

There are 1.2 dams on the Little Tennessee

River already. There is not s. dam in the last 34 miles of the
Little Tennessee before it r«inches the Tennessee, so you've
got 34 miles of open, free-flowing stream now.
The dam in question, the Tellico, is located at
the confluence of the Little; Tennessee and the Tennessee.

It

«.ill impound a body of water, rather large at the point
dan?., backing up the river for the 30 or 31 of the 34 miles to
some extent.
It will not—that dam itss-lf will not generate
electrical power, because this dam, Tellico, is very hear the
Ft. Loudoun Dura on the Tennessee, and there is a canal
connection of some 850 feet where this extra water

that

will be impounded on the Tennessee—Little Tennessee—will

5
go over into the Ft. Loudoun impoundment, and there will be
used to generate electricity in the Ft. Loudoun generating
plant, and will generate enough electricity to supply roughly
20,000 homes,
QUESTION:

General Bell, ana I right in thinking that

the Tellico Dam itself is on the Little Tennessee prior to its
confluence with the Tennessee?
ATTORNEY GENERIC. BELL:

Right, just before the

confluence.
Mow, I think it will help if I give a brief
chronology of the project.
It was authorized by Congress in 1966.
began in 1967.

Construction

In 1972, there was a lawsuit commenced based

on the fact that they had not filed an environmental state­
ment.

That litigation went on for about a year and a half,

went to the District Court, the Court of Appeals twice?
finally TVA prevailed.

It commenced working again working

on the Dam and on the project,
QUESTION:

That w&a before the discovery of the

existence of the snail darter, was it?
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL;

Yes, sir.

In 872 that

In August, 873, the snail darter was discovered.
The snail darter is of the darter—of the perch

family.

Thera are 130 known varieties of darters.

Little Tennessee River.

There hav® been 8 to 10 darters

It is supposed, to be a full grown snail darner, about three
inches in length.
QUESTION;

Is it alive?

ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL:

I've been wondering what it's

in if it is,.
[Laughter.1
ATTORNEY GENERAL SELLs

It seems to move around.

I've bean pus•£led over that.
QUESTION;

others?

Weil, I don't take it this
I don't have to reach

that point.

It's

The argument is, it takes three to

five years to be sure it's been successful.
QUESTION:

Where are they transplanted?

ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL:

They are transplanted from

the Little Tennessee to the Hiwassee.

And there they found

a similar body of water, a stream, and fresh water snails for
a diet.
QUESTION:

You say this is in the—it8 s not in the

record in this case.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL;
not the success .story.

Soma of it's in the record—

It's in public documents that were

filed with the Secretary when they tried to take th©—there's

Exactly.

So I'm

not assarting it as the truth? it’s what I've been—
QUESTION:

But TVA did ask for it to b® taken off?

9
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL»

They did, and after a year,

the Secretary denied it, just in the last two or three months.
Maybe in December.
After this darter, snail carter, was discovered—of
course TVA is an unusual agency.

They only have authority to

do whatever they can get money to do.

They are authorised—

self-authorizing, it's kaom as in the Government.
have to get money ©very year.

.And they

There has been money appiropriated

forthis dam every year, through '77.

And there's a figure, small

figure, in the '79 budget, FY '79 budget, to complete it.
0

The dam itself is completed.

All you have to do

is shut the gate, close the gate, it's over with.

It's just

sitting there.
If you'll notice in one of the amicus briefs,
Southeastern Legal Foundation, they've got some data they've
developed, dredged out of the Secretary of Interior's records,
that say that the snail darter is gone anyway, that once
they built th<ss® sluice gates, and beginning with the coffer
dams that they-“the larva© drift downstream and they are
unable to got back.
So it'8 not mougS'-t© just leave it, and walk
off.

You'd have to do something to the dam, take part of it

out, to restore the natural habitat.
Well, in the chronology, there were various things
said in the Congress which I will mention in my argument.

10
Th© issues pressit*sd is over the construction of
the Endangered Species Act, Soctioa 7 .of the Act..

The

District Court went about it, on a balancing of equities,
taking the position that it ms not to he applied completely
retroactively, that you ought to consider the stage of develop­
ment of th© project.
The Sixth Circuit said that because there was no
other way to preserve the habitat, much less the darter, that
they had to give literal effect to th® statute, and enjoin
the project, no matter what stage of completion*
Th© statute itself is set out on page 2 of our
brief, and th® critical language is, number one, "shall
consult."

But then it says that th© agency—-that would be

the TVA here—in carrying out programs, it refers to taking
such actions, th® agency must take such action, actions,
nec@sse.ry to ©insure that, actions.- authorized—this is th© key
language—funded,

or carried out by them, do not jeopardize

the continued existence of

such endangered species.

How, we—our argument is that by the way—the
language of th® statute itself can be construed to support
the District Court and allow fehis dam to be completed and
operated, and khan there arc- certain other things that I'll
argue that support that.

^

Th© District 2ourt used a hypothetical, which
already draws th© issue batter than anything I've found in the

11
whoI© case»
The District Court said that if the plaintiffs
argument were taken to its logical ertrsm© , the Act would
require a court to halt, th© impoundment of water behind a
fully complete' dan if an endangered species were discovered
in th© river on the day before the impoundment was scheduled
to take place.

And the District Court said that would, be

too extreme.
The Circuit Court said, \m disagree; that would—
that’s what th® Act means.

You'd have to shut down th® dam

%

the day before.
W© -jay that that's so extreme that it would
prohibit an agency from maintaining e facility that was
found to threaten the habitat of a newly discovered endangered
species.
We not only say that by way ©f argument, the
Secretary put it in his regulations, 50 C.F.R. 402.03; just
that, that Section ? applies to all activities where Federal
control or involvement remains which in itself could
jeopardise an endangered spaci.es or critical habitat.
So that's the issue that is presented, the issue
that must be resolved?'

Can there be a balancing of th©

equitable factors in deciding whether this action taken in
th© meaning of the statute can be taken.
QUESTION:

General, when you say "balancing

12
the equitable factors," is on© of the ways that that would be
don© the decision of the District Court or the Court of Appeals
whether an equitable injunction would issue?
ATTORNEY GENERAL. BELL;

That's it, yes, sir.

We think these-»-the three key words—-actions
modified, governed, by the words, 15authorised, funded, or
carried out./
If you give carried out tho same meaning on a pari
materiae basis, as "authorised" or "funded", it would read
then that the agency had tc have choices.

What are the

alternatives?
Mow, ordinarily, there are choices.
war© none.

It's one or the other.

Here there

It's just as both courts

saw it.
The two cases that really were choices were
the Sandhill Crane case in the Fifth Circuit, where the choice
and the option and the alternative available to the Director
of Transportation was, simply, to move aa interchange and
save the Sandhill Crane.

That’s the National Wildlife

Federation v. Coleman.
The other case was the Indiana bat case, which
is in tli© Eighth Circuit.

And there the—-and I got into this

thinking, what is the scheme of this statutes?

The Secretary

admits in his regulations, the Coleman case holds, as does
this Eighth Circuit case, r?j.-srra Club v. Froahlke, that the

13
Secretary of th® Interior does not have the veto power, that
the Act also allows a suit by a citizen.
into court and get the court to veto.
here.

So a citizen can go

That’s what happened

That’s what happened here; just said, you can’t us©

this project»
So 1 started looking trying to find the scheme of
the project, so somebody's got to face this somewhere along
the line.

And it seems to me the Eighth Circuit, in S terra

Club v. Froehlke, had it right.

That case, they said that

this impoundment behind this dam would fill keys with water
and destroy the Indiana bat.

There war® soma facts showing

that there were a lot of huts in other parts of the country;
not all the bate there in this area in Missouri would b©
destroy lid.
And the court said, the way to approach this is,
first, have in mind that the Secretary of the Interior does
not have a veto.

All the duties on the acting agency is to

consult, consider all the alternatives, and then we teat it—
that* s reviewable in court—and we test it on an abuse of
discretion, was there an abuse of discretion.
I think, in essence, that's what the District.
Court judge h®iv:s did, he took all the factors.
dam is finished for all intents and purposes.

H© said this
They have

moved these darters, snail darters, over tc another place.
We do not think that the statute was Intended to applied

14
retroactively; at leant there3® a presumption it shouldn’t be
applied, retroactively.

Taking all these tilings into consider­

ation, I hold that the dam can be used, and the project go
forward.
In other words, ho applied th@ Endangered Species
Act.
QUESTION:

what you’re saying, I take it, is that

the Endangered Species Act is not to he applied, was not
intended by Congress to be applied, to projects "that were
already underway.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL:

Well, I think it does

apply—no. I'm not saying it doesn’t apply.

It does apply,

but then you consider what stage of development is the project
in.

What are the reasonable alternatives?

Could you change the design?
QUESTION:

Could you change

Is pn<$ of the factors to be weighed

i-.ie lact that 9I.20 million has been spent —
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL;
QUESTION:

Exactly.

—at this point.

ATTORNEY GENERAL BELLs

That would ha one, and

the District judge weighed that.
I think this kind of language is the strongest kind
of argument in favor of iby position that I've been able to
find, in the Secretary's own regulation, which was in effect
when the District Court decided this case.

IS
This was what they called a tea-uncive regulation;
it's not a final regulation.

But this is what it saids

"Neither .Federal Wildlife Service nor the National Fishery
Service--that's part, of the Department of Interior—intends
that Section 1 bring about the waste that can occur if an
advanced project is halted.68

This is on a footnote on page

28 of our brief.

"The affected agency must decides whether the degree
of completion and extent of public funding of particular
projectc justify an action that may b©; otherwise inconsistent...."
Now* that's whan the Secretary had a chance to
write; a regulation before he ever found out about the Sixth
Circuit opinion.
they did.

He didn't know they were going to hold as

Th© regulation has sine© been changed to cite

th© Sixth Circuit opinion* the sixth Circuit ruling.
this was before we had any ruling.

But

He thought this is what

th® record of the statute meant.
Now* that's one-one argument.
first is—you can read this language itself

Th® next argument *
as a line,

the District Court result* and is avoiding the harsh result
of the ..Circuit Court.
Th© second mm is

th® Secretary's own regulation

at that time.
The third is that Congress three times—'75,'76*
and '77—said go forward with this project.

Mr, Attorney General Bell, I understood

your principal argument to be that the statute could not fairly

or substantially completed.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BELL:

Well, but that would b©

ATTORNEY GENERAL BELLs
QUESTION;

That's right.

Mr. Attorney General, can I ask on© question

about your argument, about why the statute doesn’t apply?
Are you saying that the statute merely requires

Act, you have to consider all the factors before the

And one fact is that this dam

Another fact is that they have moved

the snail darter over t© another place, in an effort to
accommodate the snail darter.

The third is, the law is very

clear that the Secretary of the Interior dees not have a veto.
Has the TVA consulted in good faith and dons all it can do
under these circumstances?

22
QUESTION;

Wall, the statute requires more than

just consultation in good faith.

It does require consultation,

but then it requires, in rather clear and unambiguous words,
the agency to take such action necessary to insure that actions
authorized, funded, or carried out by it do not jeopardise the
constinned existence of the endangered species, or the
destruction or modification ©£ its critical habitat.

"Action,

opinion.

It may be a un@ni.maus judgment, but I wanted to—
MR. PLATERs

Unanimous position taken by th® Sixth

Circuit that this project should be enjoined.

Thank you,

Your Honor.
The unanimous position, than, taken by the Sixth
Circuit, and th© position taken by th® Department of 'the
Interior and fey respondent, comes down essentially to two
basic points.
The first point is that Congress in 1973, when this

35
species was discovered, wrote a mandatory statute to the
agencies that it? itself, Congress, had created, prohibiting
those agencies from taking actions which would jeopardize or
destroy endangered speciesAnd that section is clearly
violated by this dam portion of the Tellico project.
And secondly, Congress has not changed the law.
Although Congress is reviewing public interest resolutions
for the conflict, Congress hasn't changed the law, and this
Court should not. amend the law.
And yet that is precisely vhat TVA's position is asking

the Court to do, to construct some form of implied, informal
grandfather clause exemption for this project.
1973 as well as at the present.

Back in

And to construct some sort of

informal statutory amendment, overriding the Endangered Species
Act, based on appropriations funding.

on® he mentioned*—and you ar® confronted with a showing that
originally there war® 300,000 of a particular species, and
now by the operation of the dam over a period of years, it’s
down to 10.,000,; and it's about to become extinct.
Are you suggesting that Congress intended that that
dam should be torn down?
MR,

platers

Your Honor, that of course is not this

case—
QUESTION;

Well,. I know; I'm asking you hypothetical

questions, to test your argument.

As we did with the Attorney

General.
MR. PLATER?

Your Honor, the question is whether

there is a remaining prospective Federal action which will

38

jeopardise a species.

It9 3 clear under the Act that the Agency

does have a statutory duty to take measures to try to conserve
the existence of the darter..
But the question of whether, in a situation where
there are no Federal actions remaining, nevertheless—
QUESTIONs

The federal action is the continuance

of the dam.
MR. PLATER:

In that situation, Your Honor, that

is certainly a question that would have to he raised.

We do

not take a position on that argument.
But the point is, Congress appears to hav© cared
very clearly about th© prevention of the extinction ©f specie®.
There were two prior statutes, in 1966 and 1969, which gave
agencies discretion, and fas* courts reviewing them, to balance
th© question, and those statutes did not work; so that
Section 1 was written in 1973 as mandatory.
Your Honor9 s question is one that is certainly
difficult to handle.

I think that the easiest way to handle

that is perhaps to take the hypothetical that General Bell
ably brought out, and that is this:

There may be cases where

th© public interest is so intimately involved with a case,
and a species would b® jeopardise, that indeed, there must
be a hard decision taken, and th© species rendered extinct.
•Wow, that9s never had to occur.

There’s never

in human history been a conscious extinction of a species.

MR. PLATERs
QUESTION:

Mr. Plater?
Y®3„
May I interrupt you right there?

Apart from the biological interest, which I said
we do not challenge, what purpose is served, if any, by these
little darters?

Are they used for food?

MR. PLATER:

No, Your Honor.

When Congress passed

the law, it made it clear that the purpose of the Act was
to prohibit the extinction of species for a variety of
reasons.

One ©£ them was where there was a food value or a

direct economic value; others, for scientific study; and
a philosophical question -that, indeed, a species efoessM @©fe
be eliminated; biological diversity.

But ultimately, there®s

44

a utilitarian purpose that is served precisely by th© snail
darter»

That is to say.» even though it doesn't have food

value, as 1 was indicating, it is highly sensitive to clean,
clear, cool flowing river water.

MR, PLATER;

and so forth.

The Devil's Cole pupfish cases, which

this Court decided, was such a case, where there was one email
area that was mad® into a .reserve*

This Court unanimously

upheld that reservation.
QUESTIONs

We weren't faced with the conflict between

the pupfish and a §120 million dam, though.
MR. PLATER%
in this case either.

Your Honor, that isn't the conflict
The §120 million which your Honor

refers to is the total project cost.

But the project is not

primarily the dams; as a matter of fact, the dam structure,
cost

§5 million, a large part of which was labor, plus

earthwork.

It, is talked about as a dam, because that was

certainly the focus for TVA't planning.
Th© $120 million, Your Honor, is for the purchase
of 38,000 acres of laud, less than half of which was to b®
flooded; that was condemned for resale at a profit to pay
off the cost of the project.

25,000 acres of those are prime

agricultural land, and to nay that that would be lost by
destroying this darter—excuse me—yes, not to consider th©
fact that th© project include» land purchases, roads and
bridges which are immensely beneficial to the people, and to
focus on the dam itself, which Congress itself is aw reassessing
completely, it to lose sight of the realities of th® situation.

47
Th® conflict, i;a this case, is between an agency
which has, since 1973, when there was only a little bit of
that concrete there, out of $120 .million t© b® spent, in 1973
they took th© position that they would not comply with th®
Endangered Species Act, and, as we noted on page 13 of our
"brief, doubled its rat© ©f expenditure—*®:<scus© me, trebled the
rate of expenditure,doubled the amount of money spent.
That is to say, the conflict in this case is between
an agency that did not want to consider anything but the
original dam as proposed.
QUESTIONS

I take; it—what, did you mean when

you said Congress is now reconsidering what ?
MR. PLATERs

¥©s, lour Honor.

One© th© injunction

cam® down, the Sixth Circuit said the law will be enforced,
that is th© rule of th©

courts. And the biological violation

has been olearly shown.

There were immediately a series of

actions taken in the proper committees with jurisdiction over
th© Act; that is to say, the House Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee, and the Senate Public works and
Environment Coraaittee.

They requested a GAO study to review
. ¥

th© cost evaluation of the dam project, and they found it
was highly unreliable; and secondly, to look at what alterna­
tives there were, eve©, today, for resolving this issue.
Mr. Justice Powell talked about it as a clam
which is fully completed, and no other alternatives.

That is

48

the way petitioner would characterise it.
But Congress is not doing
indicates that there &r© a

The GAO study

series of project modifications

which were suggested to TVA na early as 1974, which they have
rejected again and again, which still today appear to be even
more profitable than the dam.
Farming, for instancy is? the first industry of
Tennessee, and it would be destroyed in this-valley area.
Tourism is the second,, and I note, in Appendix B, this
dam project is up against the Smoky Mountains.

Ar© you suggesting, Mr. Plater, that

At least the dam?
MR. PLATERs

Yes* Your Honor,.

The dam has always

The project wasn't

It was passed to create)

industrially subsidized lots, and mors recreation, in an
area where you've already got 22 recreational lakes within
SO miles.
Congress, indeed, is saying that, although we've
lost, not $120 million, but; something far less than half of
that, th© value of the remainder may l^e several times greater
than th© purported claims for the dam.
That i.s to say, Congress is reviewing it, and I'm
pleased to announce that the agencies are reviewing it as well.
In the re-ply brief of TVA, it 1© noted that the new director
of TVA has agreed, the dam is not integral to this project.
The project has benefits which can be achieved as well or
better without th© destruction of th© valley by a reservoir.

MR. PLATERs
QUESTION:

Then you don't need aa injunction?
That's precisely right.
It’s academic.
And the law would he complied with.
But ,the question that I'm putting to you

is, should not the District Court, confronted with an
application to enjoin the operation of a dam in which $122
million worth of money, one way or the other has been
invested—
MR. PLATER;
QUESTION:

All right.

$110 million has been

invested--exercise the ordinary functions of an equity judge
weighing and balancing the equities.
MR.. PLATERs
■

Let me—yos, Your Honor, it seems to

m® that the Court does have equitable discretion.

Let me

describe, however—
QUESTION t

And that includes the equitable

discretion not; to enforce the statute?
MR. PLATERs
QUESTIONs
MR. PLATERs

-No, Your Honor, it does not;.
You think it do,as not,
Let ra© take the. far out hypothetical,

taking the Tellico Dam today, and advancing it to the point
;

of completion—that is to say, they would still have, to cut
%

■!■• down trees, bulldoze, scrape, and strip the valley^? they

v •

53

would have to construct: the canal; they would hav® to get th®
gates ready for closing—at that point , if; for instance. Your
Honor, it wer© discovered that the whooping crane required
that

valley to breed, and that, if the valley were closed,

breading would b© eliminated--breeding is considered important
for the continuation of the species—and the District Court
could not, it seems to us

in that case, Your Honor, take on

the question, which is essentially a very legislative question,
of what should be doats with the Tellico Dam»
For Instance, the court would then have to go into
the full cost accounting.

Your Honor, it would h&v® to

consider, now what is the true value of this dam—
QUESTIONS

I don't agree with you Mr. Plater.

Because you have a long history of equitable adjudication
where, for instance, a building

is built over a lot line,

and them has been a contest throughout, but the chancellor
doesn't reach a decision until the building i-s finally built.
And he may say, applying the common law, which 1ms the same
sanction to him as th© legislative laws passed, by Congress,
I will give you damage®, X will not give you an injunction.
Now why isn't this am appropriate case for that
sort of an adjudication?
MRc PLATER?

Several reasons; number on® is,

Your Honor noted, damages of course ia not a remedy.

Once

a species is rendered extinct, a® Congress said, it's extinct

>

54

forever.
Secondly, of course, that /ould be involving
private parties under th® common law.

This Court, has repeatedly

said that in cases which involve a Congressional statute,
that indeed, feh© principle which guides the Court in th®
exercise of its discretion is enforcing the law, which has
not been sot

up

by common law but, by statute.

QUESTION:

It's completely opposite in Hecsht against

Bowles.
MR. PLATERs

No, Your Honor? we are not arguing that

an injunction must be issued.
QUESTION %

Under the Hecht case—•

That is, if there were voluntary

compliance, and an injunction wouldn't be necessary.

And

that was Hecht v. Bowles.
MR. PLATER»

Yes, Your Honor«.

Th© Hecht case said,

if compliance with Congressional statute would otherwise b©
achieved, th© court of course need act issue an injunction.
We would be pleased if an injunction would not have been
necessary in this case.

Because in 1! 73, whan all options

were fully opsii— although Congress appears to indicate, and the
GAO study indicates, that options are still open today—we
would b® in a much better position to review the question.
Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

May I com© back to an argument you were

making a few minutes ago that this dam, after all, is not

55
important to what Congress intended.

I read a few words

from the Senate Appropriations Committee report. last y&ar s
the project will provide needed flood control, water supply,
recreational opportunities, improved navigation.
How without the dam and the water in it, would any
of those objectives of Congress be attainable?
ME. PLATERi

Your Honor, it should be noted that

the Appropriations Committee at not time has ever reviewed
the GAO study, the reviews taking place in the other
committees, and so on.
It turns out-QUESTIONs
MR. PLATERs

That wasn't my question.
Your Honor, it is true that there

would be no flood control, there would be no electric power
in the project—
QUESTIONs
MR. PLATER;

No recreation?
No, that is not so, Your Honor.

The

river is the last place left in the river system that has
high quality water conditions.

It's -the finest trout stream

in the Southeast of the United States•

People come from

Alabama, Georgia, and all over to fish—
QUESTION?
MR.

platerz

You’ve get Mr. Stewart's vote already.
Your Honor, it is the last place

for flowing water recreation.

And as the GAO noted, because

there have been so many impoundments—

56
QUESTION5

Do you think th® Senate of th© United

States, or the.; Sanat® Appropriations Committe®, was thinking
about maintaining this stream when it was appropriating
money to close the dam?
ME, PLATERs
discussion

Your Honor, I believe that the relevant

is in the committee that has lawmaking jurisdiction

over th® Act, and they clearly are concerned%bout recreation;
in the Hone© side as well*
QUESTIONS

Is there any record that the members

of that committee voted against this appropriation?
MR. FLATERs

Your Honor, the appropriations bill,

on its face, doss not purpert to treat fellico.

It says nothing

about Tellico*
QUESTION %

I understand th© bill on its face doesn't.

But do you think any rational person could read the reports of
the committees for the last four or five years and conclude
that there was-ary intention on th® part of the Congress other
than to complete this project?
MR. PLATER?

Your Honor, I believe that one reading

those reports would find clearly and specifically that, indeed,
Congress had no intent tonaiaead the Act.

And that is on®

of th® requirements for taking an appropriations bill, or an
Appropriations Committee report, and reading out of it an
informal, implied amendment.
of ass, intent to amend*

There must be some indication

57
As a matter of fact, 1» 1977, Sanator Steanis
specifically ©aid, if we put such an amendment in here, it
would foci subject to a point of order.

I think Your Honor's

question, however, reflectis the fact that certainly the
Appropriations Committee, or certain members of it, probably
didn't, ag£*m with the Endangered Species Act, or wish that it
didn't apply in this case.
But there was no intention expressed to amend, and
that is the only basis on which w® could us© that to change
the law.
QUESTION:

Do you think that reflects any

indication

on the part of the Congress sot to construe Section 7 as
applying to completed projecte?
MR. FLATER:

I believe, your Honor, that th®

appropriations- hill—-as ©very appropriations bill is passedpresumes that the agency will comply
relevant laws.

;ith all applicablw

Because th® agencies are creatures of Congress.

QUESTION:

You apparently didn't hear my question,

so 2811 put another one to you.
Do you think--it is. still your position, as 1
understand it, that this Act, Section 7, applies to completed
projects?

there * 11 be a need to apply it.

But. does it apply if the

need exists?
MR. PLATER:

MR.. PLATER;

If that situation

would arise. Your

Honor, it would probably be a biological rarity, la the
sense that if the species comes when the water goes up and,
down, then it's established that ifeis not endangered.
Maybe the way to answer this is on the basis of
the administrative record.

Because in the hearings last

summer, the Culver hearings in the Senate, it was again and
again noted

that the biological expertise of the Department

of the Interior Is capable of handling many sophisticated
such questione- ?
