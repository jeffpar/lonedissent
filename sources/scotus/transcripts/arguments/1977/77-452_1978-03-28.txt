ORAL ARGUMENT OP ANDREW J. KILCARR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS
MR. KILCARR:

Good morning, Your Honors.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Your Honors, in early 1969 and shortly after the dis­
covery of oil on the North Slope of Alaska, planning commenced
to build a pipeline that would reach from the Arctic Ocean,
the location of Prudhoa Bay, 800 miles south to the Port of
Valez on the Gulf of Alaska.
After overcoming numerous engineering design and
environmental obstacles, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,
indeed 51 TAPS" was constructed.

TAPS is a unique feat of

engineering, not alone its cost of $9 billion, but it is unique
also, Your Honors, because it took two acts of Congress to get
it started, the Alaska Native Claims Act, which settled claims,
aboriginal land claims by Alaskan Natives, and, of course, the
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorisation Act passed in November of
1973, which effectively disposed of that massive environmental
litigation which had delayed the project from its very

5
inception.
The TAPS situation, Your Honors, is also unique be­
cause of the regulatory treatment afforded it.

It was sub­

jected to an unprecedented rate-making and suspension order —
and I say unprecedented because there is nothing like it in
the 90-year history of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Now, to put that order and the activities of the ICC in per­
spective, one point should be emphasized, and that is though
in fact this is a single pipeline, it is in law eight separate
pipelines, and this results from the decision on the part of
the owners to form an ownership of the line on the basis of
undivided interest, so that as a result we are looking at
eight common carriers who are required under the Interstate
Coimerce Act to fill the capacity of their share of the line
as common carriers and thus are subject to all the responsi­
bilities of the Act as well as all of the rights given to a
common carrier under the Act.
In that context, the eight owners of the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline formulate! their independently calculated tariffs
for submission pursuant to section 61 of the Interstate Com­
merce Act in early June.

For example, Mobil Alaska filed its

tariff on June 10, to be effective June 20, and at the request
of the ICC it postponed the effective date until the 30th of
June.
The point to be emphasized here and at this point is

6
that the calculation of these eight separate tariffs all
followed a methodology that had prevailed in the industry for
thirty-five years.

It is referred to repeatedly in the briefs

as the consent degree approach to rate determination, which
is referenced to the Atlantic Refining case that was settled
by consent decree in 1941, it was an Elkins Act case.

And the

aspects of that formulat was before this Court in 1959 in
Atlantic Refining v. United States, and very basically what
that consent decree requires is that owners of pipelines can
receive no more than 7 percent of their share of the valuation
of the pipeline.

That is an effective limitation on what can

be paid out of the rate of return of the pipeline.

That is how

these rates were independently calculated and following sub­
mission of the tariff, again pursuant to section 61, there
occurred the issuance of an order by the ICC indicating that
on June 27th a summary proceeding to consider possible suspen­
sion of the tariffs would be conducted by that agency, and that
contrary to past practice, the entire Commission would sit en
banc in the proceeding and not a suspension board or some
intermediate board.
The issuance of that notice of summary proceeding
resulted in four protests being filed in writing with the
agency.

Two were by -- one was by the Justice Department,

another by the State of Alaska, and one by an organization
1®$ Sts» Ssurth protest by the

7
ice's own Bureau of Enforcement»
The protestants requested suspension of the filed
rates, investigation of those rates, and the seating of interim
rates in recognition that it would be contrary to the public
interest to shut the line down.
QUESTIONS

Counsel, there was no protest filed by any

independent producer in the North Slope?
MR. KXLCARR:

No, sir, there was not.

There were

four in number.
QUESTION?
the situation?

Have any indicated dissatisfaction with

Do you know why there was no protest filed?

MR. KILCARK;

We assumed at the time. Your Honor, it

was recognized by all that the situation had no financial impact,
that: is no impact on the end price of the oil, if you would,
that the price of Alaskan North Slope oil was not going to
change as far as the refinery and ultimately the consumer of
petroleum products based upon this tariff dispute.
We are at trial right now in the rate proceeding be­
fore the FERC, and in that proceeding w® have had intervention
by one public interest group, but there was none during the
regulatory phase.
The Interstate Commerce Commission held their summary
proceeding.

It was characterized or described by the agency as

an oral argument and that indeed is what it was.

It took

place on June 27th, and in that connection the owners of the

8
line, through their representatives, had opportunity to try
i in very suram ary fashion to defend the calculation on the
basis of their rate submissions, and at the same time there
was opposition in that argument to any authority on the part
of that agency to suspend these rates or to set interim rates
during the seven-month suspension period.
The very next day, on June 28th, the ICC issued its
order and in that order it purported to do and indeed in fact
did four things.

It suspended the rates as filed by the

carriers? set them for investigation? set interim rates as to
which the carriers could file on one day's notice, and those
interim rates were substantially in the case of my client 23
percent less than the rate as originally filed? and in addition
they established a refund provision in the order, making the
filing of the interim rate conditioned upon the carrier's
und<artaking to pay back the difference between either the filed
rate, the interim rate and whatever rate was ultimately deter­
mined to b® the reasonable rate in accordance with the investi­
gation ordered in the same order.
QUESTIONs

At this point, could I ask how far in

advance of the start-up time were these tariffs filed?
MR. KILCARR%

In the area of June 10th and the start­

up time, the actual loading of the first tanker in Valdes was
July 31st, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Would it have been possible for the tariffs

9
to have been filed, say, seven months ahead of start-up time?
MR. KILCARR:

Realistically, no, Your Honor, because

this was a new entity, a new service, the line was under con­
struction, and one had to wait until at least they had seme
reasonable basis to determine what their operating expenses
would be and what their construction costs would be, all for
purposes of casting the rate base for purposes ultimately of
determining what rate of return in accordance with the consent
decree formula.
Mmittedly, when the tariffs were filed, that informa­
tion was still estimated, but it was a better, more sophisticat­
ed degree of estimation than it would be seven months in
advance.
After issuance of the June 28th order, petitioners
sought review and reversal in the Firth Circuit.

A divided

panel of that circuit found principally that the suspension
provision of the Interstate Commerce Act had no plain meaning.
This is section 15(7) and the majority of the court found that
since there was no plain meaning to the language of that Act,
that indeed the agency did have suspension authority, and
further, although the court, was troubled, it appears, by the
setting of these interim rates, concluded or reasoned that
this indeed did not constitute the setting of an interim rate,
but rather was the exercise of a limited waiver of discretion
on the part of the agency that did have suspension authority.

10

The dissenting judge, Circuit Judge Roney, characterised the
order in our opinion, respectfully, Your Honors, for what it
was.

He said that it was a rate-making order and as a rate­

making order, it was unlawful and it did not comply with the
rate-making procedures and provisions explicated in section
15(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, and on that basis he
found find the order unlawful, and he did not have to consider
the question of suspension.
We are here, Your Honors, on a write of certiorari.
As I said, we are already at trial.

Trial commenced on the

rate proceeding in November, and since that time we have, of
course, received from this Cotart a stay of the June 28th
order.

That was on October 20th.

The subsequent order was

entered superseding but not effectively changing the stay, and
that second order was on November 14th.
Your Honors, as to the suspension or alleged suspen­
sion authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, now, of
course, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, because
jurisdiction of all pipelines has teen transferred v\ia the
Department of Energy bill or act to FERC.
We have analyzed in detail, Your Honors, in our brief
the conclusion arrive! at on the basis of the analysis of the
section 15(7), its language, the underlying legislative
history of that statutory provision, prior cases by the
agency dealing with suspeg&siem

©Mi Ha

©g^ysis

11
very summarily, Your Honors, we point out the essential linkage
between suspension and section 6(3) of the Act which requires
30-day notice being filed before any changes in rates, and it
is the essence of our position that section 15(7) is limited
to changes in rates or tariffs or practices affecting rates.
QUESTION:

Of course, 15(7) mentions new rates,

doesn't it?
MR. KILCARR:

It does, and that is the language of

the Act, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Your point is that that very language, the

phrase "new rates" implies the existence of old rates?
MR. KILCARR:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

exactly our position, that the existence of a prior rate is
what allows the continuity of service, the maintenance of
status quo, when a suspension takes place and the proposed
change or the new rate, literally the new rate is examined for
reasonableness by the agency.
!

QUESTION:

Are you familiar with the last sentence

of section 15(7), without having to refer to it, the sentence
beginning with "Any hearing involving a change in a rate, fare,
charge, or classification"?

MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Is it your position that when that sen­

tence refers to a hearing involving a change in a rate, fare,
charge or classification, if is in effect defining what a new

12
rate means?
MR. KILCARR:

And we so argue, Your Honor, that when

that language came into the Act in 1920, it was brought in to
make the change synonymous with the earlier use of new rate,
and that as wa characterise it constituted an authoritative
gloss upon the statute as originally enacted in 1910 by Congress
known as the Mann-Elkins Act.
QUESTIONs

Well, if new initially included initially,

then you are suggesting that the fiction which my Brother
Rehnquist referred to qualified or modified or narrows the
word "new"?
MR. KILCARRs

Your Honor, the word "initial" as the

word —
QUESTION;

Actually, initial rate can be a new rate,

can’t it?
MR. KILCARR:

It could, and we so contend, Your Honor.

The word initial is really misleading, because it tends to
V

suggest exclusively synonymous with the word ''original," and
that is not the way the agency uses the word "initial."

The

word "initial” can be an initial filing and the filing of an
initial schedule, that can contain the old rate, and that is
why we further contend that the other statutes within the
Interstate Commerce Act —
QUESTION:
original rates?

Y<m floss

fehink the word "new" can include

13
MR* KXLCARR:

No, sir, I do not.

I do not.

I think

there is an ambiguity there.

QUESTION:

Well, I would think you would.

QUESTION:

That's your whole case.

MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

You are absolutely correct.

I don't know, it doesn't have to be, if

you look at the rest of the section.
MR. KILCARR:

I suggest and the petitioners suggest,

Your Honor, that the concept of original rate, the first rate
for a new service on a new entity was beyond the whole ambit of
this act.
QUESTION:

A new rate, a new service, the rate for a

new service could never be a new rate?
MR. KXLCARR:

No, Your Honor, it could never be a

new rate in the statutory sense of the word "new."

It would

always be an original rate, and the very purpose of the
statute we suggest was to maintain the status quo, and the
suspension of an original rate on a new service and a new
I
entity would result in no service for a period of seven months,

and that particularly in the context of this case would have
been contrary to the national interest, and the ICC itself so
found that that could not be permitted, and thus in exercising
their alleged authority or their punitive authority, they had
to do something, and that is where wa get the interim rate
coming into the context of this case, and the interim rate we

14
suggest stands or falls here only if the suspension authority
is valid, because without suspension authority, this rate and
these were rates, make no mistake about it — these rates ware
found absolutely in disregard of section 15(1), which is the
rate-making provision of the Act,
QUESTION:

Well, what would be the effect on the

type of business that you are talking about if the ICC had the
power or the PERC had the power to suspend rates but not to
fisc interim rates?
MR. KILCARRs

Well, in this case, Your Honor, it

would seem to me if that were true, that the line would be
shut down for seven months.
QUESTIONS

The rate filed would be suspended and

unless the carrier came in and filed a new rat© that was not
suspended, there would foe no tariff he was permitted to charge?
MR. KILCARR:

That's right, because he cannot

achieve common carrier status until his filed rat® is approved.

I

So there could be the situation of repetitive filings, but in
a suspension proceeding there is to be no prajudgment as to
the reasonableness of a rate, thus you would have no roadmap,
if I might use that expression, no roadmap as to what kind of
rata to file.
QUESTION:

The Commission here gave you one.

MR. KILCARRs
Your Honor.

Well, they did more, respectfully,

They went well beyond that and they set the rates.

A
15
QUESTION:

Well, they sal: the rate at which you could

file that would not be suspended.
MR. KILCARR:

That's correct, Your Honor, and in doing

so
QUESTION:

They gave you a roadmap, in your words.

MR. KILCARR:

— in doing so, they also prejudged

the very investigation that they had ordered, and this —
QUESTION:

Well, how did they prejudge it when they

left the matter open with the impoundment procedure?
MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

Because, Your Honor, we —

You can't go up or down after that.

MR, KILCARR:

But in the context of this particular

case, and looking at the order that they did issue on June 28,
we suggest that it is an absolute prejudgemnt.

There was no

opportunity for us to realistically make the kinds of defense
of the rate that we were entitled to.

We have a record that

goes down to an administrative law judge who is going to try
the rate proceeding, and in that record he is being told ex­
plicitly by his appellate authority, if you will, that we were
23 percent higher than we should have been when we filed that
rate.

And I suggest respectfully that that is prejudgment, and

it is serious prejudgment, and it is what is not supposed to
occur in rate-making px’oceedings before administrative agencies.
QUESTION:

And you say that that doesn't occur, I

take it, where the PERC or ICC suspends a changed rate because

IS
there is already a rate in effect which has either bean found
to be reasonable or which at least has not been suspended?
MR. KILCARR:

That is presumptively reasonable, Your

Honor, and that is exactly our position, that it is a naked
suspension of a proposal, and that proposal then is subjected
to adjudicative investigation and a determination is made as
to its reasonableness, without any pr©judgment.

Meantime

everything continues as it was before, except the carrier is
not allowed to have the benefit of the increase in rates.
QUESTION;

So it is really the fixing of the interim

rate, rather than the suspension that would constitute the
I

prejudgment, isn't it?
MR. KILCARR;

That's correct, Your Honor.

But sus­

pension was unauthorised and unlawful, quite apart from the
rate-making aspects, simply becuase of the — wall, on the
basis of the construction of the legislative history —
QUESTION;

It was beyond the Commission statutory

power is what you are saying?
MR. KILCARR;

That's right, exactly, Your Honor.

also the fact that the status quo was bound to be not in the
public interest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kiloarr, on the question of whether

new includes initial, do you agree that in the Motor Carrier
Act it does?
MR. KXLCARRs

Your Honor, it does and it includes

And

17
initial even in 15(7).

Our point of continuing, if you will,

confusion is with this word "initial."
QUESTION:

That is as contrasted with original?

MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Would you explain that —

MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

We recognize —

Yes.

— at least for my benefit?

MR. KILCARR:

Your Honor, initial rates can be filed

in any number of circumstances.

For example, in the Motor

Carrier Act, in — I assume it was 1935, when they were bring­
ing thousands of motor carriers into the regulatory regimen,
they were filing for the first time rates, those were initial
rates.
We can have mergers of various parties and the forma­
tion of a new rate because of a new entity, that is an initial
filing.

We can have what were formerly joint rates put together

as single composite rate and refile, that is an initial filing.
But none of these equate to the situation before Your Honors
today.
QUESTION:

Well, could each one of the two be called

original?
MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?'

Couldn't each one of the two bs called

original?
MR. KILCARR:

No, no, not — whether you call it

18
original or not, it is the conceptual stand-alone Identity in
a regulatory sense that these kinds of rates have, and it is
this situation, regardless of waiver, Your Honor, that the
Commission is not authorized to suspend because suspension is
contrary to the essence of the statute which is —
QUESTION:
form then.

Let me ask the question in a different

Do you contend that if a new motor carrier went

into business and had never been in business before, and filed
a tariff, ecu Id the Commission suspend that tariff?
MR. KILCARR:

The Motor Carrier Act is a different

regulatory system, but —
QUESTION:

But it uses the same language is the

problem.
MR. KILCARR?

It is the same as 15(7) and if it is a

start-up business, a new route, new filing, it is comparable
to and identical to the situation here.
QUESTION:

And is tha answer no?

What is your answer
t

to my question?
MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

They cannot suspend as to a motor carrier?

MR. KILCARR:
QUESTIONs

The answer is no suspension.

As to the motor carrier.

But a motor carrier has to get a certifi­

cate to operata, without regard to its tariff, doesn't it?
MR. KILCARR?

The situation in the Motor Carrier Act,

as we find in Water Carrier and seme of the other Acts, is this

19
certification process, and hare in those Acts you do have the
requirement that a certificate of public convenience and
necessity.

The rate is part of the submission or can be files!

within 90 days, the filing of the original rate can be filed
after the certificate has been applied for.

And the agency,

the ICC would then have the option, whether in fact they do it
or not, and there is some debate in the briefs whether they do
it or not, but would have the option of withholding the cer­
tificate of public convenience and necessity.
i

QUESTION?

But the question is whether they would

have the power to grant the certificate, say we will do thse
things one step at a time, wa will grant the certificate, wa
will suspend your rate.

Can they do that?

You say now, X

guess.
MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION s

Well, it is not —

Do you say no?

MR. KILCARR:

No, Your Honor, it isn9t,

What w© have

contended is that, although there may be question as to whether
they can suspend or not, in the Motor Carrier Act the certifi­
cation process is such a part of it that they can withhold the
certificate if they disapprove the rate.
QUESTIONS

Yes, they can do that, tat that is just

turning th© question around.

Do they have statutory powers to

grant th© certificate and then suspend the rate, say we will
let you know, we are going to give the certificate, we just

20
don’t think your rata is right.
MR. KILCARR:

Probably not, Your Honor, probably not

in those terms.
QUESTION:

Well, what about the Federal Power Com­

mission, there is a new pipeline starting up and they file
rates.
MR. KILCARR:
Your Honor.

There the situation is absolutely clear,

Under the Federal Power Act and under the Natural

Gas Act, for the last thirty years the Federal Power Commission
has held by regulation that they don't have -QUESTION:

But that is just a construction of the

statute, isn't it?
MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

Yes, but what is there —

But it is the same sort of statute.

MR. KILCARR:

It is the same sort of statute, Your

Honor, but to the essfcent that it has a certification situation
built into it that 'die courts as well as the Commission have
consistently recognised that since this is going to be a con­
tract for a long period of time, we will ha very cautious about
issuing the certificate until we know what the sale price or
the rate is going to be, and there you have in basic relief
form the situation as contrasted to the Motor Carrier Act and
what we are looking at in this situation on oil pipelines.
QUESTION:
I 3©<a tte

Mr. Kilearr, in section 15(7) of 49 U.S.C. ,
«€■©d, and I see the language

21
"change in a rata" used.

It is a long section, I glaned over

it, I don't see the word "original" or "initial" used in it.
MR. KII»CARR:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Are those words of art or do they acme

from some other section?
MR. KILCARR:

They are regulatory words of art, Your

Honor, and I tried to make that point earlier.

You don't see

this language in the Act, and when you bring it in to describe
what the character of the rate is, it tends to be misleading,
ard that is particularly true as to the word ."initial," because
initial is not synonymous v/ith "original. "

Initial can be a

schedule filed that contains an old rate.
QUESTION:

Initial is just one of many at any stage

of the proceeding?
MR. KILCARR:
tainly.

It could, Your Honor.

You could cer­

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. FLYNN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FLYNN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The points that X would like to address myself to are
independent of your decision on suspension power.

Like Judge

Roney, I will assume for purposes of my argument that the
Commission did have power to suspend the rates.

It is our

22
position that the order is still unlawful because of the pre­
scription of rates and the imposition of the refund provisions.
We start off I think with less disagreement on cer­
tain fundamental parts of the law among the parties.

Our

opponents concede that you cannot prescribe a rate under 15(7)
or 15(1) without a hearing.

They argue that there was no pre­

scription.
The court below held expressly that its imposition of
refund conditions did not arise under the power of 15(7) but is
expressly limited to increases in rates.

They found both the

power to state the interim rate and the power to impose refund
conditions not only on the interim rate but on the originally
filed rates to arise as valid corollaries of the suspension
power, and our opponents here not only support that but say if
they ha-e the suspension power, that is the end of the case,
you can't look at what they did under those valid corollaries.
We subnit that there is plenty of law in this Court
and elsewhere that you cannot review a refusal of the Commis­
sion to suspend, because, as this Court has held, courts have
been deprived of injunctive power in that area.

But I find no

case which says you can't review an exercise of suspension
power, and I think the statute makes it clear because it says
if the Commission refuses to suspend, it doesn’t have to say
anything.

But if it decides to suspend, it has to state the

reasons therefore, and to me that is consistent with review.

23
Now, hare the Commission itself has said when it set
the interim rates, they didn't set them with regard to anything
that was going to happen, and the only period which they could
apply, the interim period -- when we went back for reconsider­
ation, they said, well, we know these rates are going to be
right for the interim period, we knew that when we did it, and
we know it even more strongly now that Pump Station 8 is off
and you won't have any thru-put, but that doesn't matter.

And

yet our opponents say you can't review that kind of an interim
rate.
Now, even if they had had a decent rate, that would be
unlawful.

The sole reliance for the power to prescribe, the

power to impose refunds is on the Chesapeake & Ohio decision.
The court below and our opponents interpret that decision as
saying you can impose any kind of a condition you want when you
refuse to exercise a suspension power.
Well, of course, we start off there, they didn't re­
fuse to exercise the suspension power, they exercised it, as
they say.

But certainly this Court did not give the Interstate

Commerce Commission or its successor, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, that kind of a license.

case has got to be one of the narrowest decisions that has come
from this Court.

And all that you did was the obvious thing of

— the railroads came in and asked for a 10 percent increase in
rates, and admitted they could only justify 3 percent of it on

24
the basis of cost, and they wanted the other 7 percent to catch
up under deferred maintenance, it was all left to the Commis­
sion, that if they were going to get the money, they could
spend it for whatever they wanted it for.
not a rate-setting decision.
selves.

That certainly is

The carriers set the rates them­

The Commission did not alter the rates, they accepted

them.
I think the difference between that case and what we
have here is made clear by reference to a couple of other decions, one of this Court.

In SCRAP I, the appellants were

attempting or the respondents were attempting to convert the
carrier-made rates there into Commission made rates by arguing
that the Commission had imposed a condition on the rate.

Now,

in that case there was another general rate increase, they
asked for an emergency 2.5 percent increase until they could
get around to filing selective rates, and the Commission
attached to that a condition that they include an expiration
date so that those rates would expire when the selective rate
increases came in* and this Court said that was perfectly
reasonable and did not convert those carrier-made rates into
Commission made rates.
In a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia that came out on March 13th, No. 75-2143, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was dealing with a request
that they impose a condition on a rate that they had a right to

25

set, was a rate for voluntary wheeling of electricity, moving
electricity from one system to another.

And Richmond Power Co.

said that's great, but hold that rate to be unreasonable unless
the carriers agree to continue wheeling even involuntarily, and
the Commission looked at the statute and looked at the history
and said Congress expressly declined to give us the power to
impose involuntary wheeling, and therefore that kind of a con­
dition is unlawful.
That is what we have here.

Congress expressly denied

the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission the power to set a rate without a hearing,
and it expressly refused to give them the power to establish
refund conditions except in the case of increased rates, and
these are wholly beyond their power and you cannot, at this
Court has said so many times, do indirectly through conditions
which are expressly prohibited from doing directly.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Flynn, going back to

Chessie for

a minute, Congress did not give the Commission power to require
the railroads to spend money under deferred maintenance, did
it?
MR. FLYNN:

But they did not withhold that power,

they did not have a contrary provision in the statute.
QUESTION:

I see.

The difference between an express

prohibition and an absence of power.
MR. FLYNN:

I don't think that I would stand here and

26
contend that the Interstate Commerce Commission has no power to
impose any conditions, regardless of what they are, on the
exercise of one of its other powers.

All I ask you to find,

as you have done before, is if the statute says you've got to
have a hearing to set a rate, then they can't set rates without
a hearing as a condition of their suspension power.

And if the

statute says you can only fix refund conditions on increased
rates, then you cannot impose refund conditions on rates that
are not increased rates as a condition of the exercise of the
suspension power.
QUESTION:

Is that another form of the argument your

colleague made about new or original —
MR. FLYNN:

No, it is not.

I am referring to the

language of 15(7) which says in the case of an increased rate,
the Commission may require the carriers to keep account and
make refunds.
QUESTION:

You are assuming for the purposes of your

argument the power to suspend?
MR. FLYNN:

Yes, I share Mr. Kilcarr's view that they

didn't have the power to suspend in the first place.
QUESTION:
MR. FLYNN:

You are assuming arguendo?
That's right.

If he is right, I don't

have to make these arguments because these two actions collapse
of their own weight.
The other case that I guess we rely on is the Moss

27
casa from the B.C. Circuit, which is remarkably similar to this
except that nobody alleges that what this Commission did was
done in consultation with the industry or was for the benefit
of tli® industry.

In that case, just as in this, the Commission

had a suspension procedure, which was summary and required
evidence.

They held an argument.

They issued an order, and

they suspended the rates that had been filed and they spelled
out in detail a whole rate plan and announced that they would
not suspend it.
Now, the evil found there by the Court was that under
that act, that insulated those rates from judicial review, that
the rates were not suspended, they went into effect and there
was no order of the CAB which would be reviewable.
Here the Commission held an argument, suspended the
rates, then announced that it would not suspend precise rates
in a rate scheme, and the contention here is that you can't
review that.

That was the intention, was to get a rate in, a

lower rate for a seven-month period, and to insulate it from
your review.
The Court in Moss found that was a prescription of a
rate, it wasn't advice, the court below hare did not find that
but clearly in my mind it should have.
coercive than this rate.

There was nothing more

You had a $9 billion pipeline sitting

there, you had oil starting to run in it, you had a congres­
sional mandate to get the oil to the lower 48 as fast as you

28
could, and you have this on-going energy crisis in this country»
and the Commission knew, as Judge Roney said, that there wasn't
any doubt that they put up that interim rate, that the carriers
would have to file it.

That is a prescription of a rate.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Easterbrook.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before turning to the question of statutory construc­
tion and the details of legislative history that are the centerpieca of this case, I want to address two themes of petitioners'
argument.

These themes run through and a-pear to be the founda­

tion for almost all of petitioners' particular contentions.,
The first theme is that petitioners have been treated
unfairly by the Commission, and that there must be sane remedy
for unfair treatment.

The second thane is that the only legiti­

mate use of the suspension power is to preserve the status quo.
The suspension here did not preserve the status quo, petitioners
say, and so there must be something wrong with it.
The arguments based on unfairness fail, we believe,
at idle outset, because the Court does not have any authority
to review suspension orders.

That was the holding of Arrow

Transportation Co. and the holding of SCRAP I.

Congress

29

entrusted to the Commission the decision whether to suspend,
and the only question that may be raised here is not whether
the suspension was fair or not but whether there was statutory
authority to suspend original or initial rates.
QUESTION:

As I understood your brother, he said

that while the Court may not have authority to review suspen­
sion orders, it may — rather an order declining to suspend, it
may have authority to review suspension orders. Did SCRAP and
Arrow both involve suspension orders?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

They both involved decisions not

to suspend.
QUESTION:

Not to suspend, did they not?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

They did.

Arrow said --

And they then stand for the proposition

that the Court has no power to deal with a suspension order.
They don't, do they?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Court indicated in Arrow, at

page 570 of Volume 372, that similar principles would apply in
tile case of a decision to suspend.
QUESTION:

And neither of those cases involved a

suspension order?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Neither involved a suspension order,

and the direct holdings of them do not support that.

I would,

however, point to a case in the Second Circuit, Port of New
York Authority, 451 Fd 2d, 783, which says that that principle

30
logically follows from Arrow, and that decision was, by the
way, cited by the Court with approval in SCRAP I.
But I needn't maintain the broad decision about re­
viewability in order to demonstrate the difficulty with peti­
tioners' arguments.

The suspension here is no more unfair to

petitioners than the suspension of an increase in rates.

In

either case, the carriers lose the difference between what they
want to charge and what the Commission by exercising their
suspension power allows them to charge.

That difference in

this case would be approximately 20 percent of the rates that
the carriers wanted to charge.
Many times established carriers seek to increase their
rates by 20 percent, and that increase is suspended, and the
difference between what the carriers want and what the carriers
are allowed to receive is the same, whether we are talking
about initial rates or whether we are talking about increased
rates.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Easterbrook, you are not arguing that

just because it is not unfair, the Commission must have the
power, are you?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
not at all.

No, I'm not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I am simply responding to the argument that be­

cause it is unfair, the Commission must not have the power,
which is something of a different argument.
QUESTION:

Well, there is a difference, too —• isn't

31
it true that where there is an existing tariff in effect, the
suspension couldn't be conditioned on reducing the existing

rate?

Say they asked for 10 percent increase, they couldn't

say, no, we will suspend the 10 percent increase, we want you
to reduce it by 23 percent.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

They could not say that, Mr, Justice

Stevens,
QUESTION*

So there is a little broader power in this

situation than in —

MR. EASTERBROOK;

It is at least in the case where

that type of thing might otherwise occur.
a little farther than that, too.

But I think I can go

Suspension proceedings in

their nature involve a balance of considerations.

Somebody

loses in a suspension case, no matter what happens.

The

shippers and the public may lose, perhaps irreparably, if rates
are too high and are allowed to go into effect.

Congress'

perception that shippers and the public would often lose was
the reason why it gave the Commission the suspension power.
On the other hand, the carriers may lose if rates are
unnecessarily or imprevidently suspended.

Nothing can avoid

the fact that someone is hurt, whether rates are suspended or
not.
The Attorney General of Alaska will discuss at greater
length how high rates hurt Alaska and why the suspension power
for initial rates is necessary.

But my point is that

32

petitioners' contention that they were aggrieved by the suspen­
sion is just one-half of the balance and is therefore not a
sufficient reason to study it in great detail.
Finally, it is hard to see how the Commission acted
unfairly here.

The Commission accepted all of the carriers'

data about the costs that they invested in building the pipelie,
even though those data are subject to very sharp dispute,

it

I

accepted the carriers' contention that the appropriate period
of depreciation is 25 years,, even though 3 5 years is the Com­
mission's ordinary period of computed depreciation of oil
pipelines.
The Commission accepted the carriers' disputed con­
tentions about income tax considerations, and it afforded the
carriers a 10 percent return on valuation, even though the
Commission's standard practice with respect to pipelines is 8
percent.
QUESTION:

With all deference, this isn't an equity

case where we are evaluating whether or not the issuance of an
injunction was fair or unfair.

This is v. matter of statutory

construction, isn't it?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

I agree entirely.

Then what has fairnes;? got to do with it?

MR. EASTERBROOKs

My point is thav. the carriers are

claiming that they have been treated unfair!» and that there
must be a remedy for that.

My observation is that that is far

33

from obvious.
QUESTION:

I didn't understand that to be their argu

ment.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The other half of my opening obser­

vation is that petitioners' argument that the suspension power
exists only for the purpose of preserving the status quo con­
fuses ends with means.

The suspension of rates, the temporary

freezing of the status quo is a means to an end, not a purpose
in itself.

It would be pointless to preserve the status quo

just for the purpose of preservation.
The reason why Congress gave the Corranission the power
to suspend

rates is because it may appear that the rates that

have been proposed are too high and that some persons may be
harmed by rates that are too high.

Shippers and the public

need protection, at least for the short term before rate-making
proceedings can occur

while the Commission conducts a more

thorough investigation.
A suspension of rates offers the public that protec­
tion.
QUESTION:

You are saying that that is a preservation

of the status quo or that it is something bigger and better

1

than that?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

My argument here is that preserva­

tion of the status quo is not an and but a means.
QUESTION:

Well, how would simple suspension of the

34

rates here In this particular case

without any interim rates

preserve the status quo?
QUESTION:

No oil?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

No oil.

The status quo would be

exactly what it was before, no one is shipping any oil through
the pipeline before and no one is shipping it —
QUESTION:

So the thing is simply delayed for seven

months?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It delays it for seven months.

Everything is left exactly the way it was before.

But the

reason why the Commission suspends rates is not because it
doesn't want to see oil flowing through a pipeline, it is not
because it doesn’t believe that a particular transportation
service should be offered.

It is because it believes that the

rates that have been proposed for those transportation services
appear to be too high.
If we keep in mind that distinction between ends and
means, the end being the protection of the public during an
interim period from rates that appear to be too high, and the
means being the suspension, petitioners’ argument we believe
falls apart.

Preservation of the status quo loses the status

as a shiboleth that petitioners would give it.

The process

really is dynamic, and it works like this.
The carriers propose a rate and if the Corranission
believes in the short time available to it that the rate appears

35
to be too high, it suspends the rate.
the status quo but only for a while.

The suspension freezes
The suspension doesn*

believe that the Commission thinks the old rate or in this case
no rate is the best rate.

The suspension means only that the

proposed rate seems to be too high.

The carriers then can re­

turn to the Commission, as section 6 of the Interstate Commerce
Act allows, with another rate proposal.

If the second rate pro

posal also appears to be too high, the Commission mil suspend
the second rate proposal.

If it does not appear to be too

high, it will allow it to go into effect.

The process can be

repeated until the carriers hit upon a rate proposal that the
Commission does not appear, doss not think appears to be too
high and the Commission allows that to go into effect.
Meanwhile, the investigation of rates triggered by
the initial suspension is proceeding, and at the conclusion of
the investigation the Commission will set a rate under section
15(1) after the full hearings that are possible only give an
adequate time.
QUESTION;

What would be the time span involved,

appr okim at ely?
MR. EASTERBROOKs
year or less.

In many cases, the time span is a

In this case, the time span, Mr. Chief Justice,

is ci goad deal longer.
QUESTION:

They often exceed seven months?

MR. EASTERBROOKs

They often exceed seven months.

36

QUESTION:

I mean typically it does, doesn't it?

MR. EASTERBROCK:

Yes.

The Mann-Elkins Act in 1910,

by the way, authorized the suspension to run for longer than
\ \
seven months. It authorised it to run for ten months. The
length of the suspension represents more a political compromise
and a balance of the interest

than any measure of how long

the Commission’s investigation takes.

The process, the suspen­

sion process then is one that moderates carriers’ rate proposals
in order to give it that -QUESTION:

What happens at the end of — suppose you

are right, there is a suspension power and the Commission
suspends for seven months, the carriers do not in the meantime
propose a rate that satisfies the Commission, at the end of
the seven-month period does the rate originally filed go into
effect?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

They can put the original rate into

effect and the Commission can do nothing about it.
QUESTION:

It isn’t a rollover type of thing like

the SEC claimed in the earlier case?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Commission does not claim the

authority to have successive seven-month suspensions, certainly
not 37 of then,
t

[Laughter]
The process by which proposals are moderated to take
into account the observation that rates appear to fee to® high

37
explains why in the Chessie case.

The Court approved the de­

cision of the Commission to suspend particular rates at the
same time they announced to the railroads that if they pro­
posed other rates with a particular condition it would not
suspend them.

In Chessie, the Commission used its suspension

power to alter the status quo in an important way, and to do so
permanently, and this Court approved it, because what the Com­
mission had done ultimately reflected only its judgment about
the reasonableness of rates.

If the Court agrees with that

point, the rest of my argument fellows, I believe, almost
inexorably.
Petitioners say that the Commission cannot suspend
initial or original rates, because initial rates for new
services are not new rates within the meaning of section 15(7).
But the reasons for having a suspension power for original
rates apply in the same way to those rates as they apply to
changed rates.

Either an initial rate or a changed rate may

appear to be too high.

The suspension in either case allows

the agency additional time to study things before the rate
i

takes effect, thus protecting the public.

And the carriers can

always propose other lower rates until the Commission decides
not to suspend.
QUESTION;

But a changed rate represents a departure

from a rate that has presumably been found reasonable before,
doesn’t it?

Doesn’t it have more against it than a new rate

38
which has never been found either reasonable or unreasonable?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

In many cases, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, a proposal to change a rate is simply a proposal to
change a carrier-made rate.

That is, a carrier may propose a

rate and it is not suspended or set aside; two years later the
carrier proposes to increase the rate.

There is no greater or

less presumption of reasonableness attached to that rate which
has been in effect for two years

only because the carriers

made it.
QUESTION;

But don't we assume that if it had been

unreasonable, the ICC would have suspended it or caused an in­
vestigation to foe made into it?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

If shippers or members of the public

had protested,the chances of an unreasonable rate being set
aside or investigated are considerably greater than if no one
protests.

But in either event, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the

point is that it was a carrier-made rate to begin with

and

\

entitled to whatever presumption of reasonableness the carrier's
own rate proposals take with than.
But if fine gradations can be made in line of pre­
sumptions of reasonableness, a responsive argument might be that
rates that have never been in effect aren't entitled to a pre­
sumption of reasonableness, and that is all the more reason for
the Commission to suspend them while it studies them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, on the question of whether

39

new includes initial or original, those petitioners rely on
Sunray, 364, and you don't mention it in your brief»

You don't

find it troublesome?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

We don't find it troublesome»

In

fact, we couldn't figure out what proposition they xvere citing
it for.
QUESTION:

Well, they quote from it, "when a producer

commences interstate sales from a particular field,.„there are
by definition no existing rates, and accordingly [the suspension
provisions], which are bottomed on delaying the effectiveness
of, ard suspending, changes, are not relevant."
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice Brennan, that was the

same proposition that this Court made in the

APCO case,

Atlantic Refining v. Public Service Commission, and it depends
entirely on peculiarities in the statutory language concerning
the Power Act, which I will —• well, the Power Act provides —
in the portion that was discussed in

APCO and in that case --

provides that regulated ccinpanies must file schedules "plainly
stating the change or changes to be made in schedules then in
force."

And it then gives the Power Commission! now the Energy

Regulatory Commission, the authority to suspend "such new
schedules."
QUESTION:

So your answer is that this —

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

It is a very different situation.

— in its terms deals only with changes?

40
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

And makes that clear, where that, is not

the case with —
MR. EASTERBROOK:

In the context of the Power Act, the

reference is to change or changes in schedules then in force.
QUESTION:

But 4(e) starts out "whan any new schedule

is filed," and you would pat a gloss on the word "new" as you
have?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
"new," Mr. Justice White.

I would not put a gloss on the word
I would emphasize the word "such,"

because the "such" refers back to the things foregoing.

I

might point out, by the way, that the statement in the portion
of the opinion that Mr. Justice Brennan read and the statement
in

APCQ simply reflected what the Power Ccmmissin’s

had been.

practice

The Federal Regulatory Commission has not decided

whether it agrees with the Power Corranission5s interpretation of
that authority.

I don't want to in any way foreclose their

reconsideration of it, but I think it is important that the
statutes are very different statutes.
There are, however, some statutes that look exactly
like section 15(7).
and Water Acts

Those statutes are in the Motor Carrier

and the Federal Communications Act.

Those

statutes that look exactly like 15(7) talk about the suspension
of new rates, but they unmistakably give the Commerce Commis™
sion and the Camnunleft%ids&s

41
original rates, even though they use exactly the language of
15(7}.

Those statutes are discussed at pages 23 —
QUESTION:

Original or initial?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION;

Original rates.

Do you think there is a difference?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

The difference appears nowhere in

the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, neither word appears anywhere in the

statute.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The only word that appears in the

statute is "new'* rates.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

We have argued that any rate that

does not represent a rate already in effect is a new rate.

It

can be new because it is an increase, it can be new because it
has never been used before.

The word ’’new" stands in that

When someone intro­

duces a new product, it doesn't mean that it is replacing some
old product.

It might be sane thing quite new, it has never

A color television was new, not because it

replaced something old but because it was new.
QUESTION:

MR. EASTERBROOK:

vision.
[Laughter]
QUESTION:

Or what about a new baby in the home when

there hasn't been one there before?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Also, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I can

refer to an analogy to the Federal Power Commission practice,
one in which this Court is familiar, and that is the definition
of new gas.

The Federal Power Commission treats as new gas

gas that flows from wells that have just been dug.
has two categories of new gas.

In fact, it

On© is gas from new flowing

wells, and another is increased flows over flows in existing
wells.

They are both new gas.

That is the same kind of thing

that is happening here, an increase in existing rate or a
brand new rate are both thought of as new rates.

But the

43

argument —
QUESTION:

Mr. Easter brook, on whan is the burden of

proof with respect to the suspension of a new rate under 15(7)?
MR. EASTER BROOK:

The Commission must find that the

nex* rate appears to be unreasonable, and it is required by the
statute to state reasons for its decision.

That implies at

least that the Commission has to make a finding.

There is no

explicit allocation in the statute of a burden of proof.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the difference between the

way the Commission proceeds under the last sentence of 15(7)
where you are talking about a change in a rate, fare or classi­
fication, and the way it proceeds when it is talking about what
you describe as a new rate and which you say is different and
broader than that?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Commission understands that to

state the circumstances under which it can as a matter of a
straight order require refunds.

That sentence entered the Act

in 1920, in the Transportation Act, and that same sentence —
QUESTION:

Are you speaking of the last sentence?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:
the date.

The last sentence of section 15(7).

All the Transportation Act did was change

I thought the last sentence of the Mann Act —
QUESTION:

I think my Brother Rehnquist means the

next to the last sentence, "At any hearing involving a change
in a rate, fare, charge, or classification, the burden of proof

44
shall be upon the carrier.”

Isn't that the sentence?

QUESTION:

I thought that was the last sentence.

QUESTION:

It is the next to the last sentence.

QUESTION:

But the sentence beginning "At any hearing"

and so on.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Now I am afraid I have lost the

thread of your question.
QUESTION:

Well, how does the Commission proceed

differently, as I take it under your analysis it would have to,
if a change in a rate or fare is a much narrower category of
thing than the filing of a new rate?

How does it proceed, dif­

ferently when it is going about suspending a changed rate than
a new rate?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as far as

the suspension power is concerned, the Commission's position is
that that sentence does not provide that a changed rate re­
ceives different suspension treatment than an original rate,
and that is so for a number of reasons.
- ir-.- ...

,

One is that that same

_ ,_v-

!■

i

sentence appears in the Motor Carrier Act, section 316, in
■

<

which it is perfectly clear that Congress intended to give the
Commission authority to suspend initial rates.
QUESTION:

Which was passed 25 years later?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

But it adopted the language of

section 15(7) because Congress thought that that is what that
language meant.

To that extent, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Congress

45

has spoken authoritatively on the meaning of that language and
has ad opted it and used it for a particular purpose, indicating what it thinks that purpose is.
My second answer is that the Commission's view is
that change for the purpose of that sentence refers not only to
a change from a rate to a higher rate, but a change frcan no
rate to sane rate, and is sufficiently broad, and it is neces­
sary to read it that way in order to make sense in the Motor
Carrier Act.
QUESTIGHs

Well, then it means the same thing as a new

rata, doesn't it, under your definition?
MR. EASTERBROOKs
QUESTION:

We believe it does,

Well, why in the Mann Act did they use the

word "new” in one sentence and. "changed rate" in another sen­
tence of the same section?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

I still believe that that sentence

came in .1920, and it is the basis for petitioners' claim of
authoritative gloss, that Congress has placed an authoritative
gloss on the word "new** by placing that sentence in the
statute.
My response as to why the language is different is
that Congress in 1920 simply doesn't appear to have thought
about the differences in the language, but that it does not
appear to have used them in different ways in light of the way
it treated that same language in the Motor Carrier Act.

The

46
language came in without —•
QUESTION;

Well, what about the sentence before, at

the expiration of the seven-month period when the rate goes
into effect, that there is a power in the Commission to require
records and a refund?

It says, "but in case of a proposed in­

creased rate or charge for or in respect to the transportation
of property, the Commission may by order require the interested
carrier or carriers to keep accurate account" — now, if there
is an original rate, there never has teen a rate, and the rate
is suspended, as you say the Commissioner has the power to do,
and seven months goes by and the rates go into effect.

Does

the Commission have power under this language to require record­
keeping and refunds?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

The Commission has not interpreted

that, although it did require record-keeping, it entered a
record-keeping provision here and the carriers have not con­
tested that, although -QUESTION:

But I take it you don'-'t — did it purport

to exerci.se this power?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

It did not purport to exercise that

refund power in this case.
QUESTION:

This was a condition, an ancillary to

your other argument, I suppose?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:
purport

It did set a condition.

It did not

to exercise that power to set the refund conditions.

47
QUESTION:

So you say that this language remains un­

interpreted?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Commission's full attention

has not yet been devoted to that language.
QUESTION:

How about yours?

[Laughter]
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Our position, Mr. Justice White,

is that we need not devote full attention to it here because
the Commission's order can be sustained quite fully on the
grounds that it gave.

But my submission so far as dealt i*;ith

the problem of the suspension of the initial rates.

If the

Commission can suspend rates, and we think that it follows
then it can announce some lower rate that it will not suspend.
The purpose of suspension, as I said, is to prevent
the charging of a price which appears to be too high.

It is

not at all to stop the carriers from offering a service.

In

order to determine what is too high, the Commission must have
at least a tentative view of how to distinguish excessive rates
from permissible rates.

In stating reasons for suspension,

the Commission may decide and announce how it made that de­
cision, how it established a tentative line.
It revealed h&re that the rates appeared to be too
high because the carriers had used an improper method of com­
puting the rate of return on investment.

If it had stopped

there, petitioners could have figured out for themselves what

48

rates they could have charged that were low enough that the
Commission would not suspend thorn.

The Commission performed

that chore for the carriers.
The petitioners seem to think that the Commission did
too good a job of thinking through why their rates appeared to
be too high and announcing its reasons.

But it would be

bisarre if the Commission could proceed within the law only
by concealing the reasons for its decisions.

Its statement

of reasons should not escpose it to a charge of illegal conduct.
The petitioners say though that this is rate-making
without the formal hearings required for rate-making.

If the

Commission's having a good reason for believing that particu­
lar rates are too high is rate-making, then I suppose this is
rate-making„ but that does not carry petitioners very far.

It

is more a play on words than an argument.
Congress authorised the Commission to suspend rates
and required that they have reasons for doing so.

The Com­

mission complied fully with the statutory requirement of having
reasons.

Petitioners' attempt to hang a phrase on that de­

cision does not do anything to impeach then.

But we do not,

however, agree that this is rate-making as that word is under­
stood within the meaning of section 15(I).

The Commission

has opened a full investigation into petitioners’ rates.

The

rates will be made after full hearings that are now in pro­
gress befox'e the FERC.

They will then be subject to full

49
judicial review.
This case concerns only vthe rates that were to be
charged during the first seven months, months now gone by.

And

Congress clearly created in the suspension power a special
sort of control that could be exercised during those seven
months without regard to the more formal proceedings in section
15(1) which Congress knew consumer more than seven months to
carry out.
The entire reason for having a suspension power is
that rate-making cannot be completed in seven months, and
certainly can't b® completed before rates go into effect in
the first instance.
Petitioners' argument that their rates during the
first seven months were influenced by the suspension power and
by the fact that the Commission announced what made it think
that the rates were too high is nothing but a resurrection in
another guise of their assault on the suspension power itself.
If, as we argue, the Commission can suspend initial rates alto­
gether, it can relax that suspension by stating reasons and
allow lower rates during the first seven months.
The final argument here concerns the refund condition.
This condition we think should be sustained for the same
reason that the Court upheld the Commission's decision in
Chessie.

The condition in intimately related to the reason­

ableness of the rates during the seven-"month period.

The

50

Commission was willing to take the carriers' assertions about
investment, depreciation and the like at face value only if it
could ba sure that any error in the carriers' favor allowing
the collection of excessive rates would eventually be cor­
rected.
The Commission was concerned about the level of the
rates, and if a refund condition were unavailable, the Commis­
sion might well have been unwilling to approve rates even as
high as those that are allowed to go into effect without
suspension.
This Court has held that the Federal Power Commission,
which lacks a general power to order refunds, may condition the
grant of the certificate of public convenience and necessity on
the carrier's willingness to make refunds,

A case in which it

did that is United Gas Improvement Co, v, Callery Properties,
382 U.S.

The Court said indeed that a refund condition was

essential to protect the public, and that it could be made a
condition even though Congress had been unwilling to provide
the Commission affirmatively with that power.
This Court itself imposed a refund condition when it
allowed petitioners to collect the rates that the Commission
had suspended.

The principle is really the same here.

The

Commission could have suspended outright, and it can protect
the public by conditioning non-suspension on the carriers'
agreement to refund rates later determined to ba excessive.

51
In sum, the Commission has used its suspension power
for the purpose it was created to serve, to protect the public
from rates that appear to be excessive, and to do so during
the seven months before a more thorough study can be completed.
This purpose applies to the suspension of original rates in
just the same way as it applies to the suspension of any other
rate.

This purpose explains why the Commission can allow

lower rates to go into effect once rates that have not been
too high have been proposed, and it demonstrates why the Com-

mission legitimately may request ‘the carriers to agree to refund rates determined to be excessive.
The same purpose underlying the suspension power ex­
plains everything the Commission did here, and its decision is
therefore correct.
Thank you.

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 O «CLOCK

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General, you

Kiay proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AVRUM M. GROSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GROSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief

Justice and Associate Justices, and may it please the Court:
The Court has already spent a great deal of time on
discussing whether or not section 15{?) which applies to new
rates only really applies to changed rates.

I had intended to

spend my time primarily on the rate question and the refund
provision which attended the ICC’s suspension of rates in this
case.

However, before leaving the question of statutory in­

terpretation, I would like to make one very simple what I
think important point.
Section 15(7) on its face is clear.

Th® language says

that you may suspend a new rate, and I think under any common
interpretation of the word "new,” this is a new rate.

The

discussion of this Court has focused primarily on other por­
tions of the statute or other portions of other statutes —
Congress enacting an amendment in 1920, Congress adopting
legislation in 1940, the Federal Power Commission Act.
Now, in my capacity, I work with the state legisla­
ture a good deal,and it is asking I think a good deal for a
legislature to be internally consistent within a lengthy Act

53
all by itself.

It is asking even more when you ask that sub­

sequent legislatures ten or twenty years later approaching the
question from different points of view and in different
statutes to be equally as consistent.
Nov/, you can probably prove a lot or nothing through
reference to subsequent statutes.

And if the interpretation

of this statute on its face, 15(7), if new rates meaning new
rates led to some sort of illogical or strange results, it
would seem to me that that interpretive process would be a very
valuable one.
But her© the statute makes eminent sense as it was
originally written.

If you interpret "new” as only meaning

changed, what you are really ending up with is a statute which
protects the public for a substantial amount of its business
and leaves the public absolutely defenseless for the filing of '
initial rates or new rates, absolutely defenseless.

Certainly

the public needs suspension, the suspension power in the ICC,
and this case so clearly demonstrates certainly as much for
new rates as it dees for changed rates.

And the carriers are

in no worse condition when new rates ar® suspended than when
changed rates are suspended, for when a carrier files a changed
rate, by definition it is assarting that the rate which it is
changing is unreasonable and is leading it not to make a
reasonable profit.

The suspending of changed rates leaves

the carriers in no worse position than they claim’they are

54
hers today.
What I am suggesting is simply taking the sentence as
it is written, interpreting it in its normal fashion will lead
to an extremely sound and logical result.

If you stretch

and

reach for an unusual result, you will rob a system which leaves
a whole area of regulation open.
For the remainder of my argument, I would like to
focus on the suspension power.

I am going to assume that the

Court will hold that there is a suspension power over newly
filed rates* and focus on whether the interim rate procedure
as used in this case and the refund provision adopted by the
Commission to file interim rates was a valid exercise of the
ICC *s power.
The question simply stated is whether the Ccmmission’s
actions ware directly related to its power to recess the
reasonableness of rates filed before it and to their power to
suspend rates pending an investigation.
To anaylse that relationship, you have to understand
a little bit more about the background of these proceedings*
because if you do it not only shows the soundness of the sta­
tutory interpretation which was urged earlier by Mr. Easterbrook
but also that both of the procedures used by the ICC when it
suspended rates and suggested a level of interim rates which
it would accept and required a refund provision are not only
rationally related to their review function, but absolutely

55
necessary to the exercise of that power.
I am here, of course, as a representative of the
people of Alaska who for the last three or four years have
undergone what we in Alaska laughingly refer to as "pipeline
impact."

"Pipeline impact" roughly defined is inflation,

increased crime, housing shortages, crowded classrooms.

These

are caused by a rapid infusion of people into a state with no
facilities to handle them.
QUESTIONS

Something like an occupying army?

MR. GROSS;

Something like that, Mr. Chief Justice.

That is very close.
The Arctic Slope Native Corporation, which is not
her® today but representated in part by myself, had it even
worse.

They suffered not only because of the things I spoke

about but they suffered cultural dislocation on the North
Slope, the Eskimo community on the North Slope.
/

Now, traditionally that type of impact is met by
social action of one sort or another, and to do that in Alaska
we need money, and the money comes from the oil and thereby
lies the problem.

The money that comes to th© Alaska from the

production of oil cones from its royalty and its severance tax,
both of which are based on the wellhead value of the oil.

The

wellhead value is inversely related to the cost to transport
the oil to market* so the higher the tariff th© less the State
of Alaska receives.

Specifically, for each penny that the

56
tariff is too high, the State of Alaska receives a million
dollars less a year.

Two dollars equal $200 million, and in

a state whose budget has never exceeded a billion dollars,
that is an exceptionally large amount of money.
When these tariffs were filed, in our view they ware
initially too high, something between $2.00 and $2.50 too
high, and w© alleged before the ICC that the tariffs were outi

rageous, for a number of viewpoints? first, that the deprecia­
tion wasn't properly calculated, that the costs of building
the pipeline had been vastly overblown, taxes hadn’t been
treated properly, a whole host of things.

We pointed out ba-

fore the Commission that we believed — and there are calcula­
tions — that the companies would receive a return on their
equity of something approaching 46 percent, and the oil com­
panies responded to us or the oil shippers responded to us,
the pipeline companies, by saying there is no real problem,
wait for your money, there is a situation, you ban get
'

reparations;

if the Commission ultimately decides that the
I

•;■■■

i .

1■

'

'

,

rates are too high, you can always go through the judicial

|

proceedings required to obtain reparations.

And we replied

before the‘Commission that that was totally unsatisfactory,
for two reasons.

The first one was that it was simply our

money and not their *s, and we had a right to receive it.
the second reason was the most important.
need! for the money.

But

We had an immediate

We had suffered impact for years, we had

57
children who were crowded in classrooms, vts had serious social
conditions which we were trying to alleviate, and we needed
tlie money to do it.
As the counsel for the North Slope pointed out before
the ICC so eloquently, it was small solace to an Eskimo child
to be told that sometime down the road there would be money for
a school.

That didn't do much for his education.

So we felt

that reparations would be an inadequate and a risky remedy.
Legally, it is extremely risky.

Traditionally, in reparations

cases, of course, the shippers seek the reparations, but here,
as the Court has undoubtedly noticed, there does not seen to
be much of an outrage from the shippers for the costs of ship­
ping this oil down the pipeline, which is not terribly sur­
prising since the peop3e who own the oil who are shipping it
own the subsidiaries who operate the pipeline.
QUESTION:

Isn't it also true that the price of the

oil at the end of the pipeline isn't really much affected by
the rate?
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:
MR. GROSS:

That's correct.
And that is because?
That is because the price of oil in the

West Coast market is primarily set by competition with Saudi
Arabian crude, and vhatever these transportation rates are,
the oil can't go abere that.
QUESTION:

Right

58
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

That is the competitive basis.
And even at the original or initial rates,

the —
MR. GROSS:

New.

[Laughter]
QUESTION:

— the cost of the oil could be competi­

tive with the —
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
— with the imported oil?
That's correct.
Are there not sane independent producers

up there not tied into the pipeline?
MR. GROSS:

Yes, but they are extremely minimal.

1

mean their interests are minimal, and I suggest that to take
on the major oil companies over an issue of whether the tariff
should be a dollar higher or fifty cents higher is an imprac­
tical situation.
We
sought the suspension rate before the Interstate
-

•T

Commerce Commission because vie wanted to receive our royalty .
and our severance tax now.

The ICC reviewed the rates and it

♦

balanced a whole host of needs.

It balance! the state's needs

for the money now, it balanced the North Slope's needs for
its money, it considered the availability of reparations, the
likelihood of the tariff scheme eventually approved and if so
at what level, the fact that the shippers were owners of the

59
pipeline companies themselves and therefore the damage if any
would be minimal, and the fact that a suspension would only be
in effect for seven months.

And they concluded after all of

that that they would accept the companies' data, though it
was severely challenged by the petitioners, that it would
refuse to accept one aspect of their methodology, in essence
the law of the case, and would approve interim rates filed at
any level which used the appropriate methodology as spelled
out by the ICC, and the companies' numbers, saying the numbers
can be challenged in the investigation.

It essence, it was

very much like a 3m»nary judgment, where the facts were ac­
cepted and the ICC in essence said you are mistaken as to the
methodology you should use.
The ICC accepted interim rates which in its view
would have resulted in a more than satisfactory return on
equity but would have resulted in $1.37 less per barrel.

That

would have been about $70 million for the State of Alaska.
:X.

Now, the ICC could have played what I can only consider games.
It could have turn©! the rates down, it could have said it is
your guess as how to get to the right number, you try and
figure out what we just said, the companies could have cone
in with a new number, the ICC could have thrown that one out,
and they could have gone back and forth.

But the ICC did

something different.
It said here is what we mean.

Your rates don't

60
qualify because you are using the wrong methodology, here is
the right methodology, and here is what it will produce; now,
anything up to that level we will approve, providing that you
also impose a refund condition, that you also assure us that
if we allow you to collect this tariff during the seven-month
period, which is based on numbers which are severely under
challenge and which we frankly anticipate that the final
tariff will be substantially lower, that you requiro, that you
set up a system to refund the excess to the State of Alaska
and the Arctic Slop© which needs this money quickly.
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, may I ask, on that

refund provision.
MR. GROSS;
QUESTION:

Yes.
We have a refund provision in our stay

order.
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

Yes?
Our stay order includes a refund provision.

Does that supersede the ICC refund order?
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, I would assume so.
Well, if it does, one of the questions

presented by the petitioners is the validity of that refund
provision in the ICC order.
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand it —
Is that before us or is that superseded

by our refund provision?

61
MR. GROSS:

Well, as I understand it, the ICC stay

order required the companies to keep the monies isolated that
would be collected between their interim tariff and the tariff
which was ultimately approved.

And what you did is you stayed

the ICC's order requiring the interim tariff or setting at the
level of the interim tariff.

You permitted the companies to

collect the tariff that they had originally filed and required
that they keep an accounting between this higher tariff and
the interim tariff, and that money supposedly is in a fund and
if the Court —
QUESTION:
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:
MR. GROSS:

Well, that is the greater, isn't, it?
Six?
That's the greater?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Well, does that swallow up the lesser?
It would —■ well, in any event —
You are —
—* if you rule in our favor, the money

will coma back to us through one vehicle or another.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't it a bit like a dependent

relative revocation, if on© is involved the other one takes
over?
MR. GROSS:

Something like that, yes^ Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

You don't h&v© the same time period though.

62
If we would decide, make a decision as to the top branch, it
would leave the other still in effect, you would still need
the reparations, the continuing proce ladings before the Com­
mission, wouldn't you?
MR. GROSS:

That's correct.

Within the time frame

of seven months, the court order protects us as well as the
ICC order.

Beyond the seven months, it is only the ICC order.
QUESTION:

So we must decide the validity of the

reparations provision in the Commission's interim order?
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So if we agreed with the petitioners that

the refund provision were invalid in the ICC order, if that
issue is still before us —
MR. GROSS:
QUESTION:

Right.
-- that is not victory for them as long as

our refund order remains.
MR. GROSS:

Well, as 1 read it, the order was some­

what contingent upon the validity of the ICCss suspension order.
And were you to say that they have no power to suspend, I
would assume that your order would not operate in that case.
I only want to say in the last word that I think it
is important to realise that if these refund provisions were
not in the order of the ICC, the ICC order, I think it is very
reasonable to assume that the ICC level of interim rate would
have been substantially less than was ultimately adopted and

63
therefore the two are intimately related.
Thank yon very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Attorney

General.
Mr. Kilearr.
OliAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. KILCARR, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. KILCARR:
QUESTION:

May I say —

This question first, and perhaps it has

already been covered.

Suppose instead of the rate that was

asked for, you had asked for four times that rate, would you
think there would be no remedy?

What would you think the ICC

power would have been?
MR. KILCARR:

Your Honor, that very question in-

trigued the Commissioners and intrigued all three of the
!

Justices on the Fifth Circuit panel that vs argue! before, and
our position then and our position now is suggesting respect-»

i'-*-ing respectfully that the ’question is not commerdaily, does
l

not make commercial sense.

But assuming for purposes of this

argument, our position would be that the ICC could not suspend
that rate even though it was at an outrageously high figure.
QUESTION:

Could they impose an impoundment require­

ment or does that standard fall with the suspension?
MR. KILCARR:

QUESTION:

Impoundment in terms of a refund order?

Could there be any remedy absent a

64
suspension?

Would there be any other remedy that they could

deal with a rate which you concede for these purposes is four
times too high?
MR. KILCARR:

In a very literal sense and on the

basis of statutory interpretation, the answer there would be
no also.
QUESTION:

There would be a right to reparations,

wouldn't they?
MR. K13XARR:

That is the critical element in all of

this, Your Honor, correctly so, that the statutory plan, the
congressional plan calls for reparations.

And I would like to

come back to the Chief Justice's question because what has
intrigued us ©very time that question has been asked is the
other side of the question.
If you assume suspension power, as Our opponents do,
could the Commission set a rat® for the transport of that oil
at, say, a dollar?

And the answer in ‘these circumstances —

and they have answered that question affirmatively before the
Fifth Circuit — yes, they could.
Now, where does the balancing come in?

I suggest

respectfully that the balancing comes in when we are dealing
with a rate established in the first instance or an original
rate, that the agency does not have authority to suspend that
rate, and to the extent that the hearing which does tak®
place after it is filed, to the extent that the hearing finds

65
that the rate is excessive, then the shipper has the right of
reparations.
If, on the other hand — and what destroys this
delicate balance — if, on the other hand, the agency asserts
authority and suspends and then finds that interestingly the
rate that was filed was a correct rate within the sone of
reason, the carrier has no way to recover the monies lost as
a result of that suspension, as a result of that interim rate
being set so low, and that wa consider to be the balance.
Now, the Attorney General has made what is essen­
tially an equity argument, talking about the need for money
now in the State of Alaska and not wanting to wait until a
reparations determination has been made.

But the situation

for the carriers, Your Honors, is that if w© were right — and
we believe we were right and we did not overreach when we
prepared and filed those original tariffs for the period July
31st through October 20th, when the stay of this Court was
enteral, we will never recover that money, and that is tens
upon millions of dollars.
QUESTION?

When you decide the question of the

equities, whether they ar© relevant or not, there is a certain
lack of parallel.

In the one case the ICC is presumably

neutral, and I think neutral, whereas in the first instance
those fixing the rates ar® not neutral by definition, not
neutral on the subject.

I don't mean that in any pejorative

66
sense.

They are very interested in the economics of it.
MR. KILCARR:

May I quickly respond, Mr. Chief

Justice, by pointing out that although not neutral in that
sens®, the carriers when they sat down to calculate their rate
had a formulation that existed for thirty-five years in the
industry, that literally thousands upon thousands of pipeline
rates had been calculated on the basis of aid that this agency
had never questioned in those thirty-five years, never ques­
tioned that formulation, and it is a formulation that was
exposed to this Court and found to be a reasonable interpre­
tation of th© consent decree that was entered in 1941.

So it

wasn't — we weren't completely alone and unfettered when
those rates were calculates.
QUESTION:

Suppose we disagreed with you on your

reading of prior Commission cases in terms of how it has con­
strued this statute down through the years, say, from 1920 on,
we just disagreed with you, that the Commission has always
assorted that — read the statute as permitting it to suspend
rates whether they are new, initial or original, what would
be your response then?
MR. KILCARR:

I would say it would have weight but

not controlling weight, Mr. Justice Whit©.

Aid I would say

further that what this Court should look at for purposes of
this question of statutory construction and interpretation is
what the Commissioners in 1910 sought frran th© Congress and

67
what they said to the Congress about the authority that they
sought.
QUESTION:

But you don't give any special — it

doesn't especially worry you that the amendment which was made
with respect to changed rates and the burden of proof in 15(7)?
MR. KILCARR:

It does not worry us, Your Honor.

Indeed, we view that as a complimentary act on the part of the
Congress.

We view the Cummins amendment in 1920 as using

language believed to b® synonymous with the new rate language
used in 1910, and we don't see it as a divergence or as sup­
portive of some limitation on the original language.
QUESTION:

Well, who has got the burden of proving

the reasonablenss of an original rate, as you say, as you call
it?
MR. KXLCARR:
QUESTION:

In a hearing, Your Honor?

Yes.

MR. KX'LCARR%

In a hearing, we would have that

burden.
QUESTION:

And who has got the burden of establishing

the unreasonableness of a changed rate?
MR. KILC&RRs
QUESTION:

I misspoke.

I thought you did.

MR. KILCARR:

I'm terribly sorry.

In a hearing ~

and ws already have an order on this, to this effect — the
protestants have the burden.

88
QUESTION:

Now, who has got the burden of proving

the reasonableness of a changed rate?
MR. K XL CARR:

The carrier in the hearing, and that

is what that provision speaks to, that last provision that was
entered at the end of 15(7).
QUESTION:

That shows seme awareness by the Congress

of a difference between a changed rate and an initial rate,
because the burden of proof is different,
MR. KILCARR:

It is reflective, I suggest, Your Honor

of the agency practice that had grown up up to that point,
where the concept of an original — strike that — an initial
rate —
QUESTION:

A Freudian slip.

MR. KILCARR,:
have suggested that tho

— achieved a life of its own.

But we

life of an initial rate is not so

broad as to encompass this rate established in the first in­
stance, this first rate for a new entity, this original rate,
regardless of the label,

And the label has been confusing,

Mr. Justice White, and that is why having to .at least to our
satisfaction analysed the' legislative history and -looked at
those ICC old and new cases,
QUESTION:

Dc you see any statutory difference be­

tween the Motor Carrier Act and the Interstate Commerce
Commission Act for this par pose, for 15(7)?
MR. KILCARR;

I do not believe it is clear, Your

69
Honor, that under the Motor Carrier Act, an original rata such
as this could be sustained.
QUESTION:

So you take the same position with respect

to the Motor Act, the Motor Carrier Act, as you do here?
MR. KILCARR:

I think that is a responsible position,

but there is something even more important in the Motor Carrier
Act, and most of the other — indeed all of the other statutes
cited for purposes of suggesting this pattern of congressional
activity, and the difference is that they ar© all licensing
statutes, and 15(7) is not a licensing statute, and the licens™
ing authority can withhold the license if the rate, the
original rate is unacceptable.

So it doesn*t have to get in

a very material sens© to the question of suspension, it simply
withholds the license.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kilcarr, is there any reason that you

know of other than tradition which would prevent the ICC or the
FERC from proceeding — in a 15(1} proceeding from holding it
on an expedited basis and having witnesses and findings in a

f

period of weeks?
MR. KILCARRs

X know of none, Your Honor, and we
