MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Smith, you nx-.y proceed whenever you’re ready.

ORM ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This federal income tax case. Commissioner vs.
Kowalski, is here on certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for tire Third Circuit. It presents a single question,
with two sub parts:

Whether cash payments to State police

trooper, of whom Kowalski, was on®, which are designated as
meal allowances, are includable in gross income under Section
61(a) of th© Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and are not otherwise excludable from income under' a special exclusion provision,,
Section 119, which caras into tire tax law at. the time of the
1954 Codification.
In a brief par curiam opinion, th© Third circuit
reversed a raviaw decision of the Tax Court with respect to
bC'h Code sections, and h®ld that the meal payments in question

hare wars ivot uror, inerr© rad, even if they were, they were
excludable under Section 119.
We submit that the Court of Appeals orrad as to both

4
points, that the cash payments are gross income as that
fundamental term in the tax law is defined by Section 61(a),
and that the cash payments here do not qualify for the limited
exclusion provided by Section 119 of the Code, which briefly
providas for an exclusion for meals furnished by employer t©
his employee for the convenience of the employer but only if
th5 meals are furnished on the employer's business premises,
So, in this sense:, the Section 61(a) aspect ©f th©
Court of Appeals decision is the most troublesome and extra*»
ordinary one, from our point of view, because it holds that a
cash payment by an employer to his employee, to defray the cost
of what, is indisputably a person!expense, the cost of ee.ti.ng
lunch during th© day, does not fit within the statutory phrase
"g "oss income from whatever source derived,
I think I can set forth the facts briefly there are
undisputed,
QUESTIONs

Mr. Smith, before you do, in your brief

on page 6 you say the "Tax Court unanimously held that th©
cash payments did not qualify for th© exclusion from gross
income under Section 119", is that correct?
MR, SMITHs

I think that's correct.

There were five

or six dissents on th® Section 61 point, but no one dissented
©a th© Section 119 point.

Judge Sterrett wrote a dissenting

©pinion, joined by five judges, set forth at pages 32a to 3?A
of th© Appendix A to the Petition, which said that «*•- which

5
concluded that; the amounts were not gross Income under Section
61 o
He didn't reach the other — I suppose one might say
he didn't reach the other point, but there was no expression
of disagreement in the Tax Court on the Section 119 point.
QUESTIONS That sounds like the case we just heard.
QUESTION?

Mr. Smith, while we have you there, you

have in mind that whssn Judge — when a federal judge is
assigned to another Circuit or if, in his regular duties, a
District Judge goes to another station to sit, he is given a
$50-a™day allowance if ha identifies the expenditures, s© much
for the room, and s© much for meals and so on.
Now, since the judge presumably eats breakfast, lunch
and dinner when he’s home, bear in mind at some point, at your
convenience, would you tell ms what you think of that situation
and under this provision or any one like it? would the judge be
required to treat as Income the breakfast, lunch and dinner?
MR. SMITH: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the proper tax
treatment, it wc-uld seem to me, of that situation would b© as
follows: The judge would

unless-it were a complete wash,

I’m assuming *— well, let me back up for a moment.
theoretical matter,

As a

all those payments are part of gross

income.
Moreover, the amounts expended for meals, when away
from home overnight, under this Court's Corre11

decision, are

6

a, deductible business expenses under Section 162 of the Cod.©.
QUESTION: Well,, but that's not true of a federal
judge.

He has. no business expenses.

In the sens© that you

are -«
v

MR. SMITH:

No, but ho has employee business expenses.

If an employee is away from homo overnight and expends money
in aid of his business, which is the business of being an
employee, those expenses are deductible.
So, to follow through on your example, th® judge would
include all of this, per diem payments, in income and take
corresponding deductions.

It may well be, given the high cost

of living these days and the particular plight that federal
judges find themselves in, that there will b® a net deficit,
in which case that will be — there will be a nat reduction.
It's possible, if the judge is frugal, that there may b© anet
amount of income.
Now, the Internal Revenue Service-, by regulation,
takes the position that if the employee is entitled — if an
take an accounting to his employsr and there is
a comp late wash, you don't have to report th© actual items on
tJhts return, but you must append a statement to your return
■saying that you've had per diem payments, you've had business
expenses, and that they nat. cut against each other.
So this enables th® Internal Revenue Service to b©
alerted to the fact, that thura or® these items on the return,

You mean all these years I've been mis-

reporting?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

What have you done —
When I go to the Judicial Conference —-

MR. SMITH:

Without making —

QUESTION:

I naver put this on my return.

MR. SMITH:

You never put the statement on your

return?

MR. SMITH:

No, neither.

Neither statement nor —

Well, I have — in preparing for this

cassef I have been advised that there is such a requirement.
QUESTION:

Do you think maybe I Should disqualify

myself?
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely not.

I think it’s —• I don’t think it’s a mandatory
requirement; it's a
QUESTION:

permissive requirement.
Mr. Smith, your answer to the Chief

Justice's question .that these allowances, in any avent, are
gross income leads me to "this question which may be of the
very outer bounds of relevancy, but that won't stop me from
asking its

As I understand the past three or four Presidents

of the country have received what &s:a called tax-free expense
allowances in addition to their salaries.
Now, are those gross income for those persons?

8
MR. SMITH; Well, I suspect probably not, if they are
tax-free, and that's — I'm not familiar with that, but that
may well be by special statute that, you know, the statute
authorising the President’s salary may provide for a tax-free
allowance.
Very much like th© military has certain tax-free
allowances which —
QUESTION; So that simply depends on the wording of
the particular statute.
MR. SMITHs

Yes. Right.

Getting back to the more mundane factual context in
which this case arose, *—
QUESTION;

And the mundane factor of federal judges

too.
[Laughter.3
QUESTION;

You don’t distinguish them, do you?

Yen don't distinguish federal judges from State highway
patrolmen, do you, for thase purposes?
MR. SMITHj For these purposes, we ar© all taxpayers.
1 don’t even exclude myself from the surface of taxpayers
This respondent is a New Jersey State police trooper,
■and in 1970 he had a base salary $8739.

He received an,

additional amount which the: State designated as a meal allowance,
whica, for 19/0, was $i697.

This meal allowance was, like

iiiii salary, pale biweekly, but unlike the salary it was paid

9

in advance, and the salary was paid for prior periods.
QUESTIONs

Is there any signifi.ean.ee in that payment

in advance?
MR. SMITH?

I don’t think so.

QUESTION; Somewhere in your argument, would you
differentiate in the Service’s treatment of military allowances
of this kind anc “~
MR. SMITH:
QUESTIONs

I shall,
— the State trooper's allowance, end

tell us precisely why one is in and on© is out?
MR. SMITH:

I shall.

QUESTION: Thank you.
MR. SMITH:

This meal allowance is described on a

Nev7 Jersey Police - rscruitmemt brochure as an item to be
received in addition to salary.

It’s clearly an important

aspect of the trooper’s compensation.
The amount of the meal allowance is a subject of
negotiations between the Police Troopers Union and the State,
and in fact has gone up over the years; it used to be $70 a
month and now it. ranges from $1740 for troopers like respondent
Kowalski, $1776 for lieutenants and captains, and $2136 for
the commander of the New Jersey Stata Police, the Superintendent
Colonel.
So there is & variation in amount depending upon your
rank

10
The meal allowances are also significantly included
in the compensation base or?, which the trooper's pension
benefits ar© computed,
Now, radar the cash meal allowance system, th@
troopers; are expected to eat within their assigned patrol area.
And what they have to do is, when they are going to go to
lunch ■—> when I us© "lunch'

I'm really talking about a mid"

shift meal, and just using "lunch" as an example — they have
to check in with ‘the officer in charge and tell them they
will b© at such-and-such a restaurant, and they will be
there for lunch .
Now, there's no restrictions'on the cash payments,
because the troopers can ©at at horna if they wish, if they
live within their assigned duty area? they can eat in a public
restaurant, as I

suggested, or they can ever* take their

lunch, take a sandwich from horn© and eat in their patrol cars,
if they so desire.
The amount of the; meal allowance is not calculated
•at all to provida an;/ kind of reimbursement for any specific
amount of meals, it's simply a flat amount per year, in this
case $1740,
On his 1970 return, respondent Kowalski report-id
hi?; $9,000-or-sc in wagc-is, which included a base salary of
$8’*39 and cash nasal allowances of $326,

New, the reason he

reported part of this cash meal allowance on his 1970 return is,

11
I think, significant.

Pa reported it because the States of New

Jersey, in October 1970 — that is, for the final quart»r of
‘this taxable year — changed its? policy end began to include
the cash meal allowances or, the Form W-2 of their troopers.
So the Internal Revenue Service began to be advised
formally of the fact 'Shat these troopers were receiving these
additional amounts.
But the respondent Kowalski did not, report the
remaining $1371 portion for the first nine months of IS70
because that wasn't included on his Form W-2.

So the only

reason this sort of cam© to the Internal Revenue Service's
*

attention —» and in one respect this aspect of the case is
really significant for purposes of the second case, because it
shows the importance of the need for the Internal. Revenue
Service to withhold on cash payments from an employer to an
employee at the source.

5

But the reason the Internal Revenue Service found
out about it is because they disallowed respondent Kowalski's
travel expenses, and after respondent Kowalski filed a petition
in the Tax Court and tho Service filed its answer, it begem to
engage in a more -» in. a deeper kind of discovery, they
discovered the fact that he had this additional $1371P by
happenstance of this litigation# and them filed an amended
answer which raised the issue which is before the Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, you're not suggesting th©

12
Internal Revenue Service is ignorant; of this kind of practice
among every
MR, SMITH*
QUESTION:

No* I'm not; suggesting —
These cases have been kicking around here

for over a decade.
MR. SMITH2

Oh„ for more than & decade, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, actually —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

I said, "for over a decade"„
Yes.

No, I'm not suggesting that,

but what I was trying to emphasize is the fact that the with­
holding requirements are very important, and I will address
■this in greater detail in the Central Illinois case, but I
wanted to simply say that the withholding requirements are
vary important to the Service in terras of insuring that taxes
are collected or employee compensation.

Because basically

the Service is set up, on its computers, that it would treat
xterns on Form W~2s as tire basic compensation of an employee,
and it’s only when matters go into audit, like this case, that
you have the happenstance of discovering an additional amount
that may not — that are net reported on a Form W-2.
QUESTION: But. you're not suggesting that what, the
employer thinks that it. ought to do governs his tax consequences,
necessarily?
MR. SMITH: Absolutely not.
he —

Absolutely not.

In fact,

13

QUESTION*

He has to explain it in some way if it’s

on the W-2 form, and hence it’s perfectly natural for him to
report it, or make some reference to it on his return,
MR, SMITHs

Absolutely not. The point I was simply

making is that when something isn't on a Form W-2, it is
mors than likely that the Service, in the normal kind of tax
administration, absent a deep audit, is net going to be aware
of a payment, of a cash payment mad© by an employer to his
employees,
QUESTIONS

Let me try this hypothetical on you®

I suppose in a State trooper situation they have a base somewhere with the radio dispatcher that communicates with- all the
cars.

Now, let's assume also the dispatcher is on duty nine

hours a day.

That's the term of his employment.

And he is

required, by the terms of the employment, to eat on the
premises and g© down to the cafeteria and pick up a tray and
bring it back to tho, to his gear, his broadcasting gear, and
remain an duty throughout the lunch period in order to handle
calls to and from troopers in the field.
Would you say that that was deductible, that that
was g ress income?
MR, SMITH: Well, Mr, Chief Justice, is this a -m xl in
kind -that's provided —
QUESTIONs

What they do, to sava bookkeeping, they

just allow him -h> go down and get, & free meal.

14
MR0 SMITHS

Bur it's a meal provided in kind by

the employer, to be eaten on the employer’s business premises *
QUESTIONs Right at the Switchboard.
MR. SMITH ;

I would think that that would be covered

by Section — by the exclusion of Section 119.
QUESTION?

That is, the question is, would it be

gross incoiY}©?
MR. SMITHs

Oh, it would be gross

Because Section 119 says it's not gross.

no, no, no, no.

In other words «—

QUESTION: Except for 119 it would be, right.
MR. SMITH: Except; for 119, it would ba gross income,
because Section 6.1 (a) begins "except as otherwise provided
in this subtitle" and this subtitle includes Section 119.
QUESTION %

Now, suppose the rules of the State troopers

required them, at meal time, to drive to a restaurant, get the
food in the restaurant and then bring it into the car and eat
it in the car, so they would be within reach of their radio at
all times.

Would you say that was -MR. SMITH; That would not b© — that would not be a

"meal in kind" provided by the employer.
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;
meal.

They would b® paying ■—

What do you mean, "in kind"?
they would be paying cash for this

In other words, Section 119 clearly and by legislative

history and the regulations provides
three requirement».

you've got to meet

No. 1, it must be a meal in kind provided

15
by tile employer; No. 2, It must be for the convenience of the
employer; and Kc. 3, it must be furnished on the business
premises„
Now , in your example —
QUESTION: Well, two of those requirements are clearly
met, aren't they, in my last hypothesis?
MR, SMITH: Well, I suppose it would be for the
convenience of the employer that
QUESTION:

And it’s on,the premises, if he's eating

in the car, isn't it?
MR, SMITH: Although I suppose it would be a debatable
question whether the meal were furnished on the business
premises if you had to go to a public restaurant to get, it.
But I think you wouldn't meet the question of "meal in kind"
if, in effect, you're getting a cash payment to go buy a meal
in a restaurant and eat it.

That would — and the statute

clearly provides you've got to meet all three requirements
under Section 119, otherwise you flunk the test.
QUESTION: Nell, then let's back up to my radio
dispatcher again, and State authorities decide it's tco
expensive to maintain a barracks cafeteria, and so they dispense
with it, but say to the radio operator:
Anc he sends across

"You nvust be on duty".

he street to MacDonald's or seme placa.

MR. SMITH: That would be gross income, because it
would not be & "meal in kind furnished by the employer".

16

QUESTIONS

In other words , the key to it is they've

got to furnish the food?
MR. SMITHS

Exactly.

And, in fact, that's really what

happened in this case, and that's what the respondents have
argued.

Because the State of New Jersey used to havea kind of

meal station system, which they
cash allowance.

abandoned in favor of this

The respondents have argued here that -- and

•throughout this case —- that because it was done on a meal
station basis before, that makes the cash payments non-taxable.
We have basically — have two answers to this;
First, item — there's nothing in the record -that permits an.
inference that the meal station allowance, this meal station
system of former days would, have been non--taxable.

In fact,

it really turned out to be for the inconvenience of the
employer.

Because the State of New Jersey found that people

were driving all around the State, to eat their meals, and
which actually turned out to be quits far from thsir duty
stations.
Our second answer to this is —
QUESTION;

How dees that, bear on the tax question?

MR. SMITH: Well, it bears on the tax question

*

QUESTION: They can. deal with that sort of a problem
by disallowing —
MR. SMITH:

No, no, it does bear on the tax

question, Mr. Chief Justice, because Section 119, one of its

17
requirements is that: the meals b® furnished for the convenience
of the employer. And if it turns out, as I'm suggesting, that
the meal — it turned out to ba inconvenient to the employer,
I would suggest, that you don't meet the statutory

test.

But putting that aside for a moment, I think that the
Court has said on a number of instances, in National Alfalfa
and Central Tablet Manufacturing Company, simply the fact that
you could do it one way and achieve a particular tax result
doesn’t moan that if you do it another way, which may be
virtually equivalent from a surface point of view, that that
will achieve the same tax result»

Each case has to be judged

on its facts»
Now, I do want to talk
QUESTION:

One point, Mr. Smith, I don't know, but

were these men working eight-hour shifts?
MR. SMITH:

I think so.

QUESTION:

Where do you eat lunch during an eight-

hour shift?
MR. SMITH:

I think they get an hour off for — time

off for lunch within that eight-hour shift.

Now, it's possible

it may be a nine-hour shift, with an hour for lunch.
QUESTIONs

Yes.

Well, the other point is, is there

anything in the record to show that they need special food or
anything like that?
MR. SMITH:

No.

No.

18

QUESTION; This is jusb a run-of-the-mill lunch,
and —

MR. SMITH;

No, they1r© allowed — they can go

wherever they want to eat lunch.

Essentially it's just, as if

my employer, or anyone’s employer, simply said;

Here’s, we’re

going to give you two dollars more a day to eat lunch.
And we submit that -those cash payments ar© tax —
are compensation for services under Section 61(a)(1), and
that -they don’t meet any — that the special limited exclusion
of Section 119, which Congress channeled in these three
requirements, And they have all got to be met.
QUESTION; So — what I maan is, it had nothing to do
with overtime?
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:
case you put, said:
during lunch.

Nothing to do with overtime at all.
Mr. Smith, suppose your employer, in the
You may leave the factory premises

Would that make a difference?

MR. SMITH;

That would not wake a difference in our

view, because that restriction might — and that basically is
this case , because that restriction might bs for the
convenience of the employer, but the cash payment doesn’t serve
•the convenience of the employer.
The employer mush provide the meals.

And Congress

said so specifically, that — in the Committee Report on
Section 119, in reporting it out — that this provision only

19

applies to Mmeals in kind'1 f it’s not a —
QUESTION: So that your case really comes down to
whether the refund is in cash or whether there is a
MR» SMITH;

Absolutely.

—

That’s critical. The cash

aspect of it is critical to the eligibility under Section 119.
And we submit that cash payments are never eligible for
exclusion under Section 119.
I don’t want to forget to turn to the tax treatment
of the military, as Justice Blackmun asked.
The military have always bean a. special case under
the tax laws? as well as generally — I think this Court’s
decisions indicata that the military have been treated
differently.
Now, the origin cf the treatment of the military
arose in ill® Jones case, which the Court of Claims decided in
the 1920s, and the Court of Claims decided that tax ~~ that
cash allowances , housing allowances, to the military would not
be taxable income.
Well, the Service had resisted it at the time? after
the Jones decision, the Service, changed its position, that
cash subsistence payments to military personnel war© includable
in gross income, and ruled that such allowances are — were not
includable in gross income.
Now, after thr.t., that position of the Internal
Revenue Service was •-«* ultimately found its way into the

20
regu.la-ti.osis — 1 -think £t*s 1.61-2 (b) of th© regulations.
So, fc 1 lowing -the Jom?,s decision, the Service, the
Treasury has, for the last 50 years, treated th© military
quite differently.
Now, during this last 50 years, the Cod© has — the
Internal — the tax law has been codified twice, in 1939 and in
1954.

And Congress was awe,re of the Treasury

regulations

providing for Iliis special treatment to what turned out to be
not just th© military but the uniformed services, which
[sic]
includes the Coastal and Geodetic Survey and Public Health
Service as well, and Congress never expressed any opinion that
this was not to ba the governing rule. And, in fact, in
37 U.S.C. 101, which we quote -at page 19 of our brief, Congress
explicitly confirmed th© understanding that regular military
compensation include "federal tax advantages accruing to afore­
mentioned quarters and subsistence alloanees."
How, the respondents in this case haves tried to make
much of the fact that there ar© analogies between the Stats
police end the military.

But, quite frankly, we think that

Congress and the courts and the Treasury have, for th© last
half-century, treated them as s. vary special case.

And, in

fact, the legislative evidence in all to the contrary, because
Congress, in 1954, enacted Section 120 of th© Cod®, which we
refer to briefly ii our brief, which basically provided a
five-dollar-a-day exclusion for -Stata police troopers for a

21
subsistence allowance. And then in .195 8 Congress repealed it,
for very much the same reason that sort of underlies our
position in this case, is that after they enacted the provision,
many States simply said

allocated part of the compensation

of State police interest to subsistence allowances, even
though that was not the intent of what Congress was trying to
dOp and they said it. basically worked an inequity:

that it

gave the State police troopers something that other people
didn’t have, so it repealed 120 in 19580
Now, if, somehow, there’s an exclusion from gross
incoma, as respondents contend, to these cash payments, then
the whole congressional exercise between 3.954 and 1958 is
really a nullity. And wo submit ’that Congress knew what it was
doing, -the military were special, and, to the extent it
addressed the problem in this case, it focused on the fact
that — and ultimately concluded that these cash payments to
State police troopers were not to be excluded from gross
income, but were to be includable.
Now, if there are no further questions, —
QUESTION s

I have one:, Mr. Smith.

What is the

government’s position with respect to Section 162?

Does it

have any bearing on this case at all?
MR. SMITHs It doesn’t have any bearing on this case,
Mr. Justice Blackmun, it ha3 more bearing in the next case.
But let. me simply say, for purposes of this case, Section 1S2

22

dropped out; of this case by the time the tax **- after the Tax
Court» Because the Tax Court had held that part, of -these cash
payments to respondent Kowalski turned out to be deductible
by him, because soma of the time he was away from home over­
night»

And to that extent, under the Court*s Corral! decision,

the Tax Court afforded him a Section 162 deduction.

And w©

have not: appealed that aspect of this decision to the Court of
Appeals, and it is, accordingly, not before the Court,
QUESTIONS Do you think your opponent can rely on
162 in any respect?
MR. SMITH s

I don’t think so.

QUESTION: Because?
MR. Smiths

It doesn’t seem to me that — we're

talking about what's left in the case is non-overnight meals9
and non-overnight meals are not deductible under the Court’s
Corral! decision which approved the Commissioner* s overnight,
rule.
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith, .-I gather from your answer to

Justice Blackmun’s question about the treatment of military
meals, in lieu payments, the Congress — there is no express
statutory authority for treating them differently from State
troopers.

You refer to the Court of Claims, Treasury

regulations, and to a Committee Report, but there's no express
statutory basis?
MR, SMITH:

Yes, there: was

there is.

I alluded to

23
it briefly.

It*s on page 19 of our brief.

3? U.S.C.101(25)

defines regular military compensation as including the federal
tax advantages accruing to the aforementioned allowances *
because they are not subject to federal income tax.
Congress

to the ex-tent that Congress has addressed

the problem* it confirmed what we -— what was the general
understanding of 'the courts end the pertinent administrative

Congress takes that, federal tax advantage into account.

Mr. Cordas.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL B. CORDES, ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, CORDES:

Mr. Chief Justice* and ra&y it pleas©

the- Court;
May I first say that my name is pronounced "Cord-es"
sir.
MR. chief JUSTICE BURGER:
given that phonetic aid today.

Mr. Cordes.

We weren't,

24
MR. CCRDES s

Before I start my main argument.e I

would like to correct two factual problems that I have with
Mr. Smith’s statement.
In response to a question from Mr. Justice Marshall*.
Mr. Smith stated that these troopers work an eight-hour dayr
and have a lunch break,

‘.that is not the case with respect to

the New Jersey Stats troopers.
In 1970 they slept in barracks for much of the; year
that they wc.ru cn duty* not under all assignments, but on
— Kowalski himself spent ed.ght months of the twelve in
barracks.
The second thing I’d like to say about Mr. Smith's
presentation is with respect to the initiation of withholding —»
QUESTION:

Is that in this case?

MR. OCRDBS:

Yea, sir.

QUESTION:

It is.

Whether or not. that lodging is income,

it’s not in this case.
MR. CGRDESt

Oh, no.

That's not.. That is not at

issue in the case.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

MR. CCRDES 5

Ho.

Mr. Smith stated that the withholding began in
1970.

That’s correct.

The; State of New Jersey started with­

holding on it a trouper’s meal a-lowances in response to presuvar,’.:
from the Internal Revenue Service, which had bean going on by

25

correspondence ever & period of several years.
The pefd.fd.pner*a argumenti, basically comes down to the
point that the meal allowance is interne because there is no
statutory exclusion.

And in order to understand how this

case fits within the long history of exceptions from gross
income, several crucial facts must be emphasised.
New Jersey State Polio© is organised along military
lines, and it has unlimitedSt&tawide jurisdiction for all
police functions? it is not merely a highway patrol.
For raora than 25 years, prior to July 1, 1949, the
State of Nex* Jersey fed its troopers at meal stations, located
throughout the State, at the expense of the State.

By 1949,

the State had found that the meal station system was no longer
acceptabis, because it tool: the troopers away from their
police duties for too much time.
Therefore, in 1949, the State abandoned tee meal
station system and instituted the meal allowance system, in
issue in this ease.

The ra&al allowance system was instituted

by the State for the benefit of tee State, and the meal allowance
system lias worked well for the State.

Not only has it provided

the State and public with better police protection, but it also
has bean proven less expensive than the meal station system.
QUESTION; 3©, do you Bay teat adds up to the
conveslenc© of the State?
MR. CORBES:

Tea, fir. Chief Justice.

26
And just &3 the State!s furnishing of meals was not;
intended to represent additional compensation, the meal
allowance , as the Tax Court, found, is "not intended to repr©sent additional compensation".
The State's accounting for salaries is strictly
separated from its accounting for meal allowances, and the twc
funds are never mingled»
Moreover, just -QUESTION;

Mr. Cordes- on your first point, that

the substitution of the meal allowance for the meal station
system was more convenient for the State than the prior system,,
but that's enough to satisfy the test of convenience of the
Stats»

Does that mean any time you have a very inefficient

system, you change to something better# that that would satisfy
the test?
MR. COHOES:

It seams; to ms, Mr» Justice Stevens,

that if you have a system that, its®If# satisfies the test,
and you switch to a system —>
QUESTION: But# by definition, your system did not
satisfy the test, because you found it inconvenient.
MR. CORDES:

It satisfied the test in the beginning.

The State had this system going for — from 1929 to —
QUESTION:

But at the time of the change, it

apparently didn't.
At; tha time — one day before you made the change# it.

27
was obviously inconvenient to the State,
MR, CORDESs

Not inconvenient, Mr, Justice, less

conveniento
QUESTIONs Well, then, the test is more convenient
than the predecessor system?
MR, CORDES % Which was also convenient.
QUESTION:

Okay,

QUESTION: Well, the ultimate objective was to keep
these men on the job 60 minutes

out of every hour, at all

times when they ware on duty? is that not so?
MR, CORDES;
QUESTION s

That Is sc.
And your position is that either of 'them

would satisfy the statute?
MR. CORDES;

Definitely.

Either of them would

satisfy the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. CORDES:
QUESTION:

No, which statute?

61 or 119?

61.
It would not be within 61?

MR* CORDES: Would not foa within 61.
QUESTION:

Neither one would be.

And you’re not.

relying at the moment at all on 119?
MR, CORDESs
QUESTION:

Correct.
Mr. Cordes, as I understand the SG's

position, it's quit's immaterial whatisr the meals were being
furnished for the convenience of the State or not.

The issue

28
is reduced, as I un.derstand it, quite simply to whether or not.
they were paid in cash or the meals were furnished in kind.
QUESTION a That's for 119, but you're —

MR. CORDES;
QUESTION;

That's for 119.
Well, I understood the Solicitor General

to make that broad generalization.

Now, 119 is quite explicit,

in that respect;.
Now, the Saunders case reached a different result,
it said that it was immaterial whether they were paid in cash
or were provided in kind.
Is that fcha only casts that would reach that
conclusion, attached only to Section 61, before 119 was
enacted?
MR, CORDESs

Yes, it is, it’s the only case that

reached that ct n,elusion with respect to State police troupers-.
QUESTION:
MR. CORDESs

A cash payment.
Cash payment. There was only on© other

cases involving the State police trooper, a cash payment to a
State police trooper, prior to ’the *54 Code, and that was the
Hyalope case, which was decidedly the Tax Court in vary brief
opinion, and never appealed beyond that /point.
The i/ottes case, to which the SG referred, held that
cash payments in commutation of meals and quarters to an Array
officer war© esscluded \mdbv the prior version of Section 61.
And in that connection, the fact that a payment is

29

mad© in cash rather than kind should not be crucial for
federal income tax purposes.

The Internal Revenue Code, er

the -tax law# rather, provides an exclusion from gross income
for a number of different types of cash payments without any
specific statutory exclusion in the Cod®.

The meal allowances

to the Armed Services is authorized for tax purposes only by
Reg. Section 1.61-2(b),

Supper money paid to employees who

work overtime is excluded from gross income by a ruling that
was issued by the Internal Revenue Bureau in 1920 and has not
been modified since.
Social Security benefits are excluded from gross
income without any specific statutory section. Welfare benefits
are excluded from gross income without any specific statutory
section. And Unemployment Compensation itself is excluded from
gross income wi thout any specific statutory section.
QUESTIONs Soma of those exclusions from gross income
are the result of court decisions, aren't they?
MR. CORDES{

They ara, as —

QUESTION:

I mean, this wasn't a voluntary act. of

grace on the part, of Internal Revenue Service?
MR, CORDES;

That's correct.

with tli® military pay exclusion.

And as was the case

That originated with a court

decision.
QUESTION;
MR. CORDES s

Yes.
The states provides the same — the

30

troopers with the same nasal allowance, exactly th© same meal
allowance, every trooper gets th® same regardless of his length
of servi.es and regardless of his salary» Their salaries do
increase with length of service*
QUESTION? And regardless of whether ha eats or not»
MR» CORDESs And regardless of whether h© eats or not»
However, we have a stipulation in this case, and a finding
by the Tax Court that the taxpayer spent at least the amount
of his meal allowance for meals while in uniform on active
duty»
QUESTIONs

But do you also have a stipulation that

says no two people eat the exact amount of food?
MR» CORDESs

[Laughing]

I don’t think w® need a

stipulation on that»
QUESTION: Well
MR, CORDIS;

The meal allowance is not calculated

to provide reimbursement for any specific number of meals,
but is rather an averaging devics appropriate to the policy
of the State of New Jersey of rotating its troopers among
various assignments, to give each trooper a broad range of

experience,
QUESTION:

Now, it*s true, is it not, that

lieutenants receive a larger meal allowance than -troopers,
' captains receive a larger meal allowance than lieutenants?
MR, CORDES:

That, is true.

31
QUESTION s
MR0 CORDE3 s

And majors a larger one than captains.
That; is true,

QUESTIONi And the superintendent, the largest of all?
MR» CORDES:
QUESTION:

That is true,
And no claim -Shat they have different

MR, CORDES:

No claim that they have different

However, I have no doubt in my mind that meal

allowances in the military services also increase with rank.
And, appropriately, the nature of the duties of the
higher officers may well be such as to require them to eat at
more© expensive places than the troopers have to eat in, and
the higher officers also get a higher uniform alloanee
because their uniforms are more elaborate,
QUESTION: Well, now, wait a minute.
is driven by a trooper, isn't ha?
MR. CORDESs

The superintendent

Most of the time.

Well, I would assn so.

QUESTIONs Well, they both stop and eat lunch.
did th© superintendent get more?

Why

Couldn't the trooper eat the

same place h© eats, and ciat the same food he eat®?
MR, CORDES:

May 1 say, Mr. Justice, it's not crucial

to my case that th® meal alXowances that ar© paid to the
superintendents and the officers are excluded from gross
income.
QUESTION:

But I think involved in your case is the

32
fact that, for some reason which, up till now, has not: been
explained, at least to me, a superintendent, sitting behind a
desk, needs more food than a trooper running up and down the
road „
MR. GC-RSES:

I c&n only ascribe it to custom, just

as in the military»
QUESTION: Well, these men aren't; in — some of ‘them
never have been near the military.
MR. CCRDESs What I am saying is that this is a
military type organisation, it’s very similarly patterned to
the military, as you can tall from the titles of the ranks
'themselves, and if they are following military practice, they
probably naturally assume that officers get more than the men

do.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe w® should adopt -that in the

Court,

MR. CCRDESs

The meal allowances for meals, troopers

ar■) required to eat while they are on active duty. They are
on active duty when they are in uniform, performing their
official duties. They are on active duty in uniform when they
©at the meals for which the meal allowance is paid.

They

must, obtain permission to eat, and their meals are frequently
interrupted by the demands of their duties, and, Mr. Chief
Justice, they carry radios on their persons, which enables
thorn to be summoned by headquarters when they are eating their

33

meal»

They don't, have to go out to the car to be at the radio,
QUESTIONS

Mr, Cordas , supposing you had all the

sara© regulations about what; they had to do during the lunch
hour., carry a radio, and where they eat, and all the rest, and
they did not get. a meal allowance, but instead they were paid
an extra $15 a day or whatever it might be
higher salary.

they had a little

How would one system serve the convenience of

the employer more than the other?
MR. CORDES:

I think the reason that the meal allow­

ance is paid is that they are on duty and expected to be
functioning when they are eating their meals. They eat on the
run, Thety don't have a lunch hour,
QUESTION:

May I suggest, that's not responsive to

my question.
MR. CORDES:

Then perhaps I didn't understand the

question.
QUESTION:

How does one system serve the convenience

of the employer mors than the other, of the two alternatives
I gave you?
MR. CORDES:

It doesn’t, but this raises a question

KS'uft the govern»ant has raised. They say it may wall be

convenient for the troopers to have their meals under these •
circumstances, but it's not convenient for the State to have
to pay for the. meals „
If that's 'the case, it seams to me there is no

34

convenience of the employer doctrine at all, even within tile
context of Section 119, because for any employer it's more
convenient to have something don© the way he wants it and not
have to pay for it»
QUESTION: Does this not come back to what Mr» Smith
himself suggested, that sometimes calling a thing by a name
makes it on© way or tee other under tax law, as distinguished
from the law generally?
MR. CORDES:
in this case»

That, does happen sometimes»

But not

QUESTION?
MR, CORDES:

They didn't call it ’’pay” here, they ~
They didn't call it "pay”, they called

it a meal allowance because it replaced th© system providing

concedes was not taxable,
MR. CORDES;
QUESTION:

I would as yum® !3©0
This is a subject of collective bargaining,

and has bean, between the Troopers Union and the State?
K'R. CORDES:

It has. Tha Troopers Union was organised

in 1968, and the meal allowance system was instituted in 1949,
and the mere fact that it’s a part of the collective bargaining
negotiations, I don’t think affects the outcome, because —
QUESTION:

No, I didn't; •—» I just asked th© question

35

whether or not it is,
MR. CORDESs

Like other conditions of

I suppose it's higher now than it was in

MR. CORDESs

It is.

QUESTIONS As a result ©f
MR. CORDES s As a result of inflation.
QUESTION:

- collective bargaining.

MR. CORDESs

And collective bargaining, too, yes.

QUESTION s And the economy.
MR. CORDESs And the economy.

And the salaries are

higher now, too.
Almost immediately after the State instituted the
meal allowance systam in 1949, the Revenue Service challenged
it in the Saunders case, a 1950 case, where the facts were,
in the words of the Tax Court, in this case, not substantially
different from those in this case.
Saunders excluded the meal allowance under the
predecessor of Section 61, under the convenience of the
employar doctrine. And this has been the law for the New Jersey
State troopers’ meal allowances always, under the meal station
system they didn't pay tax on it, under the meal allowance
system they never paid tax on it, as a result of Samders,
until this case has been brought again by th® government.

36

On© point; I'd like to emphasize in reaching your
decisio■ is the equity argument.

That is, equal treatment

among taxpayers who are similarly situated,

I, myself, find

it very difficult i» draw a distinction between military
officers and Ste.te police officers who are working in a State
police department which functions under this system, with
barracks and long hours, uniforms, and not being a mare highway
patrol.
If tii©re is a convenience of the employer doctrine,
as there must be, if the military pay exclusion

Judge Sterrett her® in the Tax Court found that it's difficult
to conceive of a situation where an employee must so clearly
take his meals at the convenience o£«i® employer, as is the
CSC;-,: with the law Jersey State troopers.
QUESTION; But if Congress has recognized the meal
allowance end, so forth for military by separate statutes,
doesn’t that remove some of the necessity for bringing it
under the convenience of tie employer doctrine?
ME, CO ROES;

Mr, Justice', I think in the statute

to/;t Mr. Smith cited, I think all that Congress has done is
to recognize that there is a well-recognized exclusion.
QUESTION t

Yes, ’’ checked and that came out; of

the Armed Services Committee rather than the Ways and Means
Committee.

37

MR. CORDES:

Right.

That is not a tax statute.

That statute just says, "Look, the revenues boys have decided
this? and so that's the way we'll treat this."

It's not part

of the tax law.

It's still a congressional recognition.

QUESTION;

You couldn't believe that they would.

MR. CORDES:

I think they would be out of their

minds if they tried to do it. at this point.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. CORDES :

Yes.

The statutory definition of income itself is not
particularly helpful. The Section 61 of the Code simply says
gross income me eras all income, from whatever source derived.
So it's defining itself within itself.

And* as a definition*

'therefore* the language is defective; and therefore these
glosses have grown up on the- statute over a period of time,
judicially* administratively* and, of course* legislatively.
Convenience of the employer doctrine is one of them.
It’s not the only cna.

It's not the most well-known one. But

38

it's -there, and it has been. there for a long time. And
counsel for the government Is saying that if you have a cash
payment you can’t possibly com© under the convenience of the
employer doctrine*

And, to reach -that finding, you have to

decide that all cash payments are income and it’s clear that,
under our tax system, all cash payments are not income»
QUESTION!

Mr» Cordas, I taka it, you are placing

no reliance on 162?
MR. CORDES s
in this cas©.

Let; me giv© you the context of 162

In fchs Tax Court we briefed the 162 question?

we lost the case in the Tax. Court on a very close decision»
On appeal w® briefed all three questions, S@cti.on 61, Section
119 and Section 162»
The Court, of Appeals, in reversing the Tax Court
on the

basis of Saunders, in Judge Sterxett’s dissenting

opinion under Section 61, did not, in my opinion at least,
reach the 119 question, and did not at all reach the 162
question.
QUESTION: And 162 provides what?
MR. CORDESs

162 providas a deduction, whereas the

other two provide an exclusion from income? 162 provides
QUESTION;
MR. CORDES;
QUESTION;
MR. CORDESs

Is a deduction.
Is e, deduction, right.
My question is, ax® you relying on. it?
To keep my judgment below, I certainly

39

would rely on it.
QUESTION: Despite Correll?
MR. CORDES s

X must say, to rely on it, the limita­

tions would have to be put on the scop© of the Correll test.»
QUESTIONS So you do not agree with Mr. Smith that
it. just has faded back —
MR. CCRDESs

X don't agree with Mr. Smith that it's

faded, because, although the government — what the Tax Court
did was to allow a deduction for two-thirds of the meal
allowance, because he was

i:way

from home two-thirds of the

time.
The government did not appeal from the allowance of
the two-thirds deduction. F® did appeal from the disallowance
of the one-third deduction.
Mr. Chief Justice;, unless there ere further questions,
l have completed ray presentation.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE; BURGER: Very well, thank you.
Mr, Smith, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

I have a couple of points, Mr, Chief

Justice.
The respondent heu suggested that there is this nonstatutory convenience of the employer test, which somehow
suffuses Section 61 of the Cod®, and enables him to exclude

40
those cash payments from gross income0
But even assuming, as we point out in our brief,
that there is such a test, and we don't think that there —
we tliink that that test has never bean channeled exclusively
into Section 119? but even assuming that h@'s right, that
there is such a test, undor that test he has to meet two
qualifications, by his own analysis,,
He has t® demonstrate that thesis amounts were non­
compensatory# and he has to demonstrate that the cash payments
were for the convenience of the employer.
Wa submit that he; meets none of those tests with,
respect to Section — with respect to his own analysis.
First of all# with respect to Section **- with respect
to whether the amounts were compensatory # he relies on a finding
of the Tax Court that the meal allowance was not intended to
represent additional compensation.
But# &b I pointed out,# in my opening argument# that
is a slender read. That finding of the Tax Court does not say
that they war© not coxnpenations # it simply said what the State
hoped that they would be? and this Court has said# in
Co;-.missloner _vs. Dubiarstain, that what the parties hope# labels
put, on things# what they hep® fcfca tax effect will fc@ is
irrelevant for purposes of tfhat; the objective circumstances

are.
And# I:.-, fact.# later, c*n in the Tax Court's opinion#

41
on page 13A* they say:

Even though we have found that: the meal

allowance was not intended as addi.td.onal compensation* it was
obviously compensatory to a trooper* to the extent that it paid
for food which h© otherwise would haw had to pay from some
other source*
We conclude* under Section 61* that* except as
otherwise provided in the Income tax lav;, the roaal allowance
[sic]
received by petitioner is includable in its gross income.
How* with respect: to the convenience of the employer *
we siibm.it that cash payments do not serve the convenience of
the employer* because what the respondent has dons is to
confuse the issue by attempting to talk sbout all these meal
restrictions.

That, is * you. have to ©at it within the? patrol

area* you have to eat within a certain area. But the point
is* he hasn't explained why those restrictions have anything
to do with Hi® conva
don© is

of the employer. All they, have

in other words* if* as Mr. Justice Stevens has

suggested* they simply paid cash, as they did* and didn't:
call it a ros&l allowances
QUESTIONs But doesn’t it serve the convenience of
the employer* that is, the state of New Jersey * that they
have this man on duty end or* call for SO minutes of the entire
lunch hour?
MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice* th& meal restrictions

s^rv© the convenience of the employer* but the fact that the

Stata of New Jersey paid oesh doos not serve the convenience
of the employer. And we submit that that is the critics,.!
