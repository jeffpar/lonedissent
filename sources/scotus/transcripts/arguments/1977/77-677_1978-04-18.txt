GllAL ARGUMENT OF EMIL F. SODORO DM
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SODORO
the Court# gentlemens

%

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may ife please
We stand before this Court today on

the case of Owen v. Kroger# which has basically a single
issue to present to you# and the issue# generally stated# iss
On a State court claim, can th® plaintiff in a civil action in
a Federal court file a direct claim against a third party
defendant with whom the plaintiff shares common citizenship?
Or take it as just one step further in this particular case#
gentlemen# what w© have is a plaintiff who maintains a suit
against the defendant who is not in comity with her citizenship#
who files a third party complaint# and that6s our client in this
particular case# against a third party defendant and then -the
original defendant i© excused from th® proceedings on a motion
/

i

for summary judgment.

/

Ife is our contention —
QUESTIONs

When you say excused fro:,- the proceedings#

you mean th© original defendant moved for summary judgment
and it was granted?

4
MR. SODOROs

That9 & right.

Moved for a summary

judgment, there was a hearing before District Judge Denney.
Ha sustained the motion for a summary judgment, and that
motion for a summary judgment was in fact appealed by the
plaintiff in this case to the Eighth Circuit Court which
affirmed the judgment sustaining the motion for summary
judgment.
QUESTIONS
MR,, SODORQs
defendant was excused
I think;

So afc that stag© you had what parties?
At that stage, after that original
and 2 us© that word appropriately,

dismissed perhaps is a better word, your Honor --

dismissed fro® the suit, what we had was an administratrix
of an ©state, who was a citisen of Iowa, who by this time now
had filed a direct claim in the original Federal district
court proceedings against the -third party defendant.
QUESTION s
HR, SODORO x

That was an amended complaint?
Yes, sir, your Honor. It was on the

basis of an amended complaint.
So at this point, at this juncture, the original
defendant is no longer a party to this case.

And what we have

is that the plaintiff at this stage of the proceedings and the
defendant for the purposes of diversity of citizenship, which
is a demand for jurisdiction in the Federal court, were both.
residents of the same State.
Originally this accidant arises out of a complex

5
set of facts,; asci I am sure that you are aware of the facts
and 1 won31 belabor them with yon.

But this is a suit for

damages that arises out of a claim for wrongful death that
occurred while the plaintiff

decedent was in the course of

his employment..
Now* on© of the issues, or on© of the matters, that
was also involved in -tills case that mad© it additionally
complex to keep th® parties straight, was the fact that when
the plaintiff originally filed tills suit, the employer of th®
plaintiff, which was also an Iowa resident, -the Paxton &
Vierling Company, was mad® a party defendant, and Federal
District Judge Denney, in order to retain the jurisdiction,
realigned th® parties»

That original employer defendant

was made a defendant only for the purpose of subrogation of
the Workman8s Compensation claims»
QUESTION3

To'that extent th© employer defendant

would have had more in common with the plaintiffs than with
the, defendant»
MR. SODOROs

That8s right, your Honor,

tod it was

for that reason, as I say,.that the trial judge, Judge Denney,
realigned that party and in fact mad® the Paxton & Vierling
Company —
QUESTIONS
MR. SODOROs

Which was th© employer.
Yes.

— a party claimant for the

purposes of retaining jurisdiction of the case,

tod as you

6
say, their interests were in fact aligned.
QUESTION s
MR. SODOEOs
QUESTION?
MR. SODOEOs

That8 a a new lawsuit
Beg pardon?
That's a new lawsuit, than.
Well, it was really part of the

original lawsuit, as it was treated in this case.

What

happened was -the parties were simply realigned, Mr. Jostle®
Marshall.
QUESTIONs

You realigned them because yon lost the

regular party.
ME. SODOEOs

That is correct.

Actually, as fchs

case was originally filed —- and you have got .it exactly —
there was no diversity of citizenship that would confer
jurisdiction on the Federal district court because there was
no Federal question involved, and by the admission of the
plaintiff in that original complaint one of the partias was a
resident of the same State as was the plaintiff.

I'm glad you

noticed that.
But in any ©vent, this case finally cam© to trial
and the question a® to the jurisdiction of. the court, and it's
our contention that the Federal district court never had any
jurisdiction to hear and decide the case between the petitioner
that stands before you today and the respondent for the
reason ~ and again very simply stated, it's not a complex
ease, at least as we view it, because there was sm

I

«4

7
citizenship between the respective parties that ware involved
in the litigation.
Now, Judge Denney, the trier ©f the case — and his
declaration is in the case — said that he felt this was a
case where he had to decide whether ife was a matter of pendant
or ancillary jurisdiction.
Now, w@ have searched the authorities, ©vary
authority possible, and it seems that there isn't any question
•

.j:

that the Federal courts, one© they hav© the original jurisdic­
tion betwaan a plaintiff and a divers© defendant, that that
defendant may make a third party defendant who is a resident
or a citizen of the same State as the original defendant.

No

question -about that.
QUESTIONi
MR. SODORO:

Same State as the original plaintiff.
As the original plaintiff or the

original defendant.
QUESTION %

„

*

Well, if the original defendant, there is

so problem, because presumably the original plaintiff and the
original defendant were of diverse citizenship.
MR. SODOROi
QUESTION%

Right.
If the third party defendant is of the

same residence as the original defendant, them there is no
problem at all.
MR. SODOROi
QUESTION%

Thera is no problem at all.
But you are talking about a third third

8
party practice bringing in a defendant who is of the same
citizenship as the original plaintiff..
MR. SODOROi
QUESTIONs
MR. SODOROi

Yes.

hnd I see no problem with that.

That.5B permissible; that33 established.
I sea no problem with that.

But th© problem that arises here? Mr. Justice
Stewart? is in that the plaintiff in this case was permitted
to file a direct claim? donct you ssef against that third party
defendant*
QUESTIONS
MR. SODOROi

Right.
Now? w@ can find no eases in any

jurisdictions in the Federal court that permits such practice?
let alone find any case particularly where the original
defendant is removed ©r excused or dismissed from th® case that
permits any such practice.
Gentleman? it would be really? I think? a waste of
your time for aa to reiterat© to you th® portions of our brief.
I am sure you are acquainted with thorn.

But it was our feeling

and it9s our contention today that Judge Denney was mistaken?
that tills is not a eas® for determination as to whether or not
it is a matter of panda at or ancillary jurisdiction.
QUESTIONS
straight.

Mr. S odoro ? let m© just get on© thing

Does your position depend at all on tha fact that

th© original defendant was dismissed out. of th® ease?

MR. SODQROs

In part? but not necessarily.

Our

9
principal argument is that the plaintiff could not do what she
did here because she was not entitled to do it. under Federal
practice.

There was no jurisdiction that would inure to the

Federal court,
It0 s true that that has some bearing and some
effect.

But here is what it is, your Honors

The plaintiff

ends up suing • in the Federal court a person who is a citizen
of the same Stats as the plaintiff.
authority for that typ© of
QUESTIONs

And we submit there is no

jurisdiction.

How is that any different in practical

effect between A suing B and B having a cross-claim against C„
and then after everything is all done, C pays E and B pays A?
Isn’t it the sam© as C paying A?
ME. SODOROs

Yes, it has a substantial effect.

have to assume it this way, Your Honors

You

Let’s say the

plaintiff instead of filing only her lawsuit against 'the
defendant, would file her lawsuit against both the defendant
and the third party defendant.
QUESTION?
MR. SODOROs

Then there would b© no jurisdiction.
Thera would b® no jurisdiction in the

Federal court. And all of the cases have that :s their holding.
Well, you cannot do in the record, you see, what you ar© not
permitted to do by way of jurisdiction in the record.
QUESTIONs

On the pleadings, thought initially5

this appeared to be a suit by a resident of Iowa against a

io
Nebraska corporation# your client»
MR. SODORO:
QUESTION:

That5s right# isn't it?

Yes, sir.
It wasn't until the trial was almost over

that was introduced the fact that actually the Nebraska corpora­
tion had its principal place ©f business in Iowa.

MR. SODOROs

On the record that is generally the

enact statement.
QUESTIONs
MRo SODOROs

That's what happened# isn't it?
Not exactly.

That generally is what

happened.
QUESTION:

Mien did the fact that the Nebraska

corporation had its principal place of business in Iowa# when
was that revealed to the court?
MR» SODOROs

That was revealed at the —* when you

say "to the court” ~
QUESTXON:
MR. SODOROs

To the partias#, for that matter.
To the parties.

Please let me answer

that one# your Honor.
On the 23rd -- no, I fcak© that back.
On the 3rd day of June 1974 —
QUESTION s
MR» SODOROs

When did the trial start"
The trial commenced# your Honor# on the

12th da;/ of January 1976.
Now# here is how it cam® about# so that the parties
had knowledge of the location of the principal place of

11
business of this third party defendant, our client, the
petitioner here.

The deposition was being taken pursuant to

request by the plaintiff, not pursuant to notice, but pursuant
to production of the witnesses.

The attorney for the plaintiff

said, "I want to sea th© books and records of the Owen
Equipment and Construction Company, and I want to take th©
depositions of the officers," and by agreement that was done
at th© headquarters of this petitioner, sir, on the 3rd day of
June 1974, and the headquartars ar© located in Carter Lake^
Iowa.
QUESTIONS

Right there, Mr. Sodoro, Carter Lake,

Iowa, is on th© west side of th© Missouri River, isn't it?
MR. SODOROs
QUESTION?

Yes, it is, your Honor.
And isn't it a kind of nubbin sticking

into th© city of Omaha?
MR. SODOROs

Your description generally is accurate,

except that it is not a nubbin that is part of the city of
Omaha? it is out of the city of Omaha.
QUESTIONs
MR. SODOROs

Near the airport.
out near the airport, exactly.

And what

you have there is when the States were originally divided
by the Missouri River, there was a band in the river and that
bend in the river somehow avulsed to the east, and there is a
piece of land, despite the fact that it is located

on the

west side of the Missouri River, that is really a part of

12
Iowa.

And that is a very well-known fact in our community

because the city of Omaha is always complaining that they
have to render certain services to the city of Carter Lake,
Iowa, and the real estate taxes and the State income taxes and
the State sales taxes have to go over to DesMoines, over to
Iowa.
QUESTION:

This is why I was asking whether every­

body really didn’t know t^hat the situation was at all times,
MR, SODGRO:

I think that’s pretty general knowledge,

because there is a community, there is a city, that is known
as the city of Carter Lake, Iowa,
QUESTION:
MR, SODORO:

And you have a city hall there,
And they have a city hall and they have

a mayor and they have city councilman,
QUESTION:

But I take it, apart from this aspect in

the background, the fact it’s on the west side of the Missouri
doesn’t cut any ice in this litigation,
MR, SODORO:

Not in the least.

Not in the least,

particularly with respect to the question of jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

When was it that you raised this question

that there was no -jurisdiction?

Was' that at the trial the

first time?
MR, SODORO:

Our original answer that was filed to

the amended complaint as filed by the respondent —
QUESTION:

And that was filed when?

13

MR. SODORO:

That was filed, your Honor — well, the

i);

»

plaintiff’s amended complaint was filed against, directly
against Owen, on November 3, 1973«

And thereafter, on

November 27, 1973, we filed an answer on behalf of Owen, and
in that answer admitted that the Owen Erection and Equipment
Company was a corporation existing under the laws of the State
of Nebraska, because that is a fact, and then went on to deny
generally all of the other allegations of the plaintiff’s
amended complaint against Owen.
One of the allegations —
QUESTION:

Did you expressly raise the question that

we have our principal office in Iowa and therefore there is
no jurisdiction?
MR. SODORO:
QUESTION:
MR. SODORO:

No, we did not at that time.
When did you?
That was raised on the record.

First

of all, as I told you, on the 3rd of June 1974. when that
■i.

deposition was taken, counsel for those questions

— and those

answers were given in response to interrogation made by the
attorney for the plaintiff.

But the formal request, or the

formal filing of the motion to dismiss was not filed,'and the
reason it wasn’t filed is, very honestly, we d:.dn5t give it
the adequate consideration that this issue deserved.

I submit

What position do you

Do you take the view that it8s your obligation to call

to the attention of the district court by motion at some
stage its lack of jurisdiction* or that that’s something that
may be raised by any party or by the court on its own motion

authorities ~
QUESTXGI-?s

What is your justification for that?

I mean, the d@fsnda.nt could never have sued tha third party
defendant in the Federal court.
MR» SODORO:

Well, the theory is ths.t the plaintiff

selects the forum for th© trial and disposition of th©
plaintiff’s claim.

All right.

Now, tha theory that permits

19

ancillary proceedings by a defendant where yaw have the
original diversity of citizenship between the original two
parties, the theory is that this now is an ancillary proceeding
between the original defendant, who becomes the third party
plaintiff, and 'the third party defendant»
ancillary portion of the proceedings,

That is the

hnd the courts have

indicated that that’s perfectly OK, that that falls within the
purview of the jurisdictions of the Federal courts,
QUESTION:

I know you are saying tint is what the

cases say, but I still don’t understand why you think the
Federal court is more qualified jurisdictions: j@ to try that
claim than a claim by the plaintiff against a Aird party
defendant.
MR. SODOROs

Because the plaintiff lid not, unless

there is diversity of citizenship between that plaintiff and
the third party defendant —
QUESTION:

Well, there is diversity between the

defendant and -the third party defendant.
MR. spDORO:

But the reason for that is, your Honor,

that it is in conformity with rule 14 of the Federal Rules of

Procedure.
Now, I would like to retain, if I might, gentlemen,
just a few minutes left of -my argument,
QUESTION:

Mr. Sodoro, before you ait down, there

was mention a few moments ago about the statute of limitations.

20
I note that the dissenting judge in the court of appeals in
note 42 of his dissenting opinion* appearing on appendix
page 32 of the petition for certiorari, indicates that it is
his belief that this action would not be barred by the Iowa
statute of limitations if the judgment of the court of appeals
were reversed.
Now, I appreciate that you don’t want to take the
position here that —
MR, SODOROs

Mr, Justice Stewart* X know it’s there

and I certainly wish to make no comment about it at this time.
QUESTIONS

But tli©re certainly does seem to bo a

difference of opinion* and therefore perhaps the question
is not — there is no clear-cut answer to it* at least that’s
fair to say.
MR. SODOROs

And 1st me say fairly and honestly

I don’t know if there is a clear-cut answer.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN C. SCHREMPP ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SCHREMPP:
please the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it

Our position in this matter is generally

simple* we hops* and that is -chat we simply contend that the

21
United States district court had the power to retain and
dispose of this case in its waning moments when for the first
time the jurisdiction was attacked and that it was withis the
discretion of the district court to retain and. dispose of this
cause under its ancillary powers and

under the unique

facts of this case,!, as may be readily apparent from a reading
of the timetable of extents in this ease»

Therefore, the

United States district court to have failed to retain and
dispose of this litigation which had been pending for four
long years in Federal court would have indeed seen an abuse of
his discretion in rejecting a final disposition of this claim
on® day before it was to go to the jury.
QUESTIONS

At some point in your d:. :j cuss ion would

you enlighten us about the Iowa savings, statuta? Do it in jour
own time»
MR. SCHREMPPs

The Iowa savings statute, your

Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is a statute that, from my knowledge
of Iowa law, is as vague and nebulous and its boundaries are
as murky as Mr. Justice Blackmon mentioned about the boundaries
of Iowa and Nebraska on -the west side of the -Missouri River.
I do not know.
QUESTIONS

Counsel, if on this day before the case

was to go to the jury the pleadings had been called to
Judge Denney’s attention and he had construed the petitioner’s
answer to the allegation as to diversity as a denial of your

22
allegation as to diversity, and he said, "We simply don’t have
diversity here/ would you say that if he had construed it in
that way? he should have been reversed by the Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit if he had said, "I am going to dismiss
this case right now for want of jurisdiction3?
MR, SCHREMPPs

Yes, your Honor. Under the facts

and circumstances of this particular case after the four years
of litigation, I think it would have been an abuse of his
discretion at that point even.
QUESTION:

Then you really don’t regard Federal

courts as courts of limited jurisdiction.

You treat this very

much as the court of original jurisdiction in Iowa and Nebraska^
as general jurisdiction unless someone comes in and moves to
dismiss.
MR. SCHREMPP:

No, your Honor.

courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.

Of course, Federal
I think that limited

jurisdiction, though, derives in the power of the United States
district court, the United States district judge, if you will,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, provides in general that this court
may in appropriate circumstances retain a jurisdiction of a
case ~
QUESTIONs

What rule are you referring to?

MR. SCHREMPPs

Rule 14.

Rule 14 does not in and of

itself—and I would rather quote words from 3ary v. Wyer in the
Second Circuit on that — Rule 14 doss not extend jurisdiction.

23
It merely sanctions an

impleading procedure which rests upon

the broad conception of a claim as comprising a set of facts
giving rise to rights flowing both to and from a defendant»
For solution of the incidental jurisdictional problems which
often attend utilization of the procedure , the concept of
ancillary jurisdiction ■which long antedated the Federal Rules
may often be drawn upon»
1 do espouse that view, your Honor.
I would like to comment on what this case does not
concern.

From the standpoint of equity and fairness, this case

does not concern a forum-shopping situation,

'vie plaintiff

in this case was not an in-state plaintiff seeking to gain
some advantage over an out-of-state plaintiff.

The plaintiff

in this case was an ©uf-of-state plaintiff coming to the court
of Nebraska„

There was no forum shopping, which I think with

respect to the discretion ©nereis© of -the court is worthy of
comment.
Secondly, there was no advantage gained, find I arcs
calling particularly attention to Aldinger, your Honor, we did
/

not implead a new party.

We started out, as ha3 been slightly

delineated by counsel, with a suit against the 3maha Public
Power District.

If Owen had chosen in its answer to

\

flatly deny that it was a resident and citizen, as you allege
it to be, so that there was no way of interpreting its pleading
other than a denial of diversity jurisdiction, that it had
done nothing more, would you still say that it was estopped?
MR. SCHREMPP:

Certainly for the 18 months after the

statute ran there would have been no impropriety about going
ahead because the Omaha Public Power District certainly wouldn't;
have let Owen out.

They joined them in the fi st place.

They were after them, and we were both after t:ara.

You were about to approach the question

of ancillary or pendant type jurisdiction.

Would you cars to

MRo SCHREMPP:

I feel, of course, there is a

would like to think of tills with respect to both your question,
Mr, Chief Justice, and your question, Mr, Justice Marshall,
with respect to what would have happened had this issue naver

Is Owen then

against Owen?

Wouldn't both issues be submitted to the jury?

MR. SCHREMPP:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens.

In my

hypothetical situation here, the jury is submitted the case
with respect to our claim against OPPD.

Now, that does not

arise out of the same elements of negligence.

Our claim

against OPPD was based on the fact that we claimed that they
had strung their high-tension wires which —

We sold the whole

We felt there was enough control left and

we felt that stringing their high-tension wires, they are
insulated*by air and space, which means that they are bars

the discovery we developed the case also against Owen Equipment

QUESTION;

In other words, there were two quite

separate claims against Owen, one directly by your client and,
secondly, by Omaha Power District against them indirectly,Vianet
that right?
MR. SCHR3MPPs
QUESTION 5

Yes, based on —

Once Omaha Power was out of the case,

30

then the third party complaint necessarily fell, too, didn't it?
MR» SCHREMPP %

Hot under these eircurastaneas, we feel,

no, your Honor»
QUESTION:

How could they be liable by way of a

third party complaint if the third party plaintiff had
prevailed, had been found not liable at all?
MR» SCHREMPPs
QUESTIOH s

You mean in my hypothetical case here?

Yes»

MR» SCHREMPP?

All right»

The jury could have

found that the Omaha Public Power District was not negligent
in the construction and maintenance of the wires.

The jury

could have found that the Owan Erection and Equipment Company
was negligent in the operation of its crane»
QUESTIOHs

But that would not justify a recovery on

the third party complaint, because the third party complaint is
brought by Omaha Power against Owen, and if Omaha Power had
no liability, it had no injury and nothing to recover over in
the third party complaint.
MR. SCHREMPPs

Omaha Public Power District might

have failed on its third party complaint, but I feel that we
were —
QUESTIONS

You recover only directly against Owen

just as though you had never sued Omaha Power at all.
MR. SCHREMPPs

No, because we couldn't have sued

Owen directly originally, but it was a proper impleader under

Rule 1.4 by Omaha Public Power District and then Owen ~
QUESTION;

Only so far as it related to Omaha

Power's claim over against Owen.

The impleader didn't justify

it, unless I misunderstand you, didn't justify your asserting
an independent claim of negligence on behalf of Kroger against
Owen, did it?
MR. SCHREMPP;

Basically, the Omaha Public Power

District alleged that Owen was negligent and therefore made
them a third party defendant.
QUESTION;

And then you filed a separate pleading

in which you made such allegation.
MR. SCHREMPP;

Yes.

And the question is whether that pleading

One of the comments of Mr. Justice White, I believe, pointed
that out.

that's so.

Cases that were persuasive in Nebraska»

The opinion of the

Robert Van Pelt in Nebraska had held that enact thing in two

Robert Van Pelt, his Honor in Nebraska,

is a highly regarded judge»

They are district court opinions»

X think we have a difficulty in connection with
case law in this in that in most cases the statute of liraitations has not run, and if a district court rules against the
existence of the third party claim, rather than go through
the, let's say

expanse, let's say

uncertainty,of an appeal,

that many district court casas are allowed to remain one way
or the other, because the State court remedy is still available»
In other words, rather than take -the chance of simply filing
in State court,

the ease that is urged most vigorously by the petitioner,
even in Kenrose, there is some possible interpretation of

rule.

And in that particular instance,in Kenrose, the court

did say ■—* excuse me.
Kenrose was in 1971»

In September ©f 1975 the

Fourth Circuit again had the situation where they approached

33

this particular problem.

v. Fred Whitaker we broadly held that there must be an
i-

independent basis of jurisdiction of a claim by a plaintiff
against a third-party defendant.

And then in footnoting, they

said, "After Kenrose was decided,"and they cited another
section of a case previously decided.

Then they say this,

"Were we inclined" — and they are talking about the harsh
prohibitory rule

"Were we inclined under any other context

to reconsider the absoluta rule of Kenrose, we would not find
it appropriate to do so hare."
In other words, what w@ are contending basically
and simply is this, that the presence of a rule without
exception, of an absolute, prohibitory rule, under the
circumstances of this particular case, of this particular case,
would b® unjust and inequitable.
QUESTION*

Judge Sobeloff’s

opinion in Kenrose

was absolute and prohibitory only in the sense; that it said,

the burdens as well as the benefits.

You have available to

you your Stats court of general jurisdiction in which you
won't suffer those, and that is your alternative.
MR. SCHREMPPt

In that particular «as©, I believe

the facts were slightly dissimilar, your Honor, slightly
dissimilar.

QUESTIONS

Didn’t Judge Sobaloff say in Ken.rose

that the plaintiffs could have gone into the State court
without having all of the problems that were now raised
because of pendant and ancillary jurisdiction?
MR, SCHREMPPs

Yes* and he said the State court

remedy was then available to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff’s
State court remedy in Kemrose, I assume, was available and no
statute had run upon it#

I don't think that's possible, sir.

But after you hear me in this regard, you will find
that there is no reason for that.
First of all, let me say this:

Thera is a judicial

finding by Judge Denney in the record in this c s© which is
to th© effect that this petitioner before this Court today is
lin fact an Iowa resident.

Bear in mind, gentle an, that there

are two places that a corporation can exist-for purposes of
•jurisdiction under the law which grants jurisdiction to the
Federal court.

On© placa, of course, is the pl;s© that it is

domiciled where the articles of incorporation a.: a filed, no
question about that.

But the Congress of the United 'states has

declared by law that aa additional place of cor:orate existence
is where that corporation has its principal plana of business.

Now, our answer demanded strict proof, you see,
of this allegation, strict proof that in order for the Federal
court to have jurisdiction over the defendant, than it became
necessary upon .shis plaintiff to prove in th® case where we

46
end up being the direct defendant? to prove that we were in
fact a Nebraska corporation and that our principal place of
business was in Nebraska»
QUESTIONS

Turn to page 28 of the appendix? in

paragraph 1 of your answer.

You say you admit that Owen

Equipment and Erection Company is a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Nebraska.
MR. SODOROs

Right.

That's all.

Via do not admit

in that answer that they have as their principal place of business?
you see? Omaha? Nebraska.
QUESTION;
MR. SODOROs
for the strict proof.

Right.
And therefore our demand com@s now
Th© only proof presented at the trial

in connection with the citizenship of th© defendant Owen? the
only proof was the proof from the officers of the Owen Equiproent Company which was that their principal place of business
was in Iowa.

And Judge Denney therefor© mad© a judicial

finding that —

MR. SODOROs
QUESTION;
MR. SODOROs

Where is that?
B©g your pardon? sir?
Where is Judge Denney's finding?
Oh? I don't know if I can find it.

It's also recited in th© opinion of th© Eighth Circuit.
As a matter of fact? we have cited in our reply
brief some of the words from the record as recited by Judo®

47
Denney.

On page 6 fee says this:

"I don5fc think they ©var

admitted anything” —* and h© is referring now to the defendant
'i

:

•V

Owens — "I don't think they ever admitted anything.

The

proof here before this Court today by the Secretary of the
Owen Equipment, and Erection Company , their principal place of
business was in Carter Lak©, Iowa.'3

That was the only proof

in th© trial of the case, gentlemen.
The trial court in its memorandum as filed, which
is also part of the record, found this:

"Plaintiff, an Iowa

citizen, alleged that jurisdiction was based upon 28 U.S.C. 1332,
that th© defendant is incorporated in th© State of Nebraska
and has his principal place of business there.

It is now uncon-

trovarted, however, that defendant’s principal place of business
is in th© Stat® of Iowa.

Hence, an independent, basis of juris™
.. .'

diction does not exist. J
QUESTION:

It is not sufficient under the s@ Federal

statutes then if the plaintiff is a resident of Iowa, the
defendant corporation is incorporated in Nebraska

but has its
.Av

principal place.* of business in Iowa.
MR. SODOROs

Then for the purposes of th© Federal

jurisdiction statute, both those parties are residents of th©
J7

v-‘

same State.
QUESTION:
MR. SODORQs

So fcher® is no diversity.
So there is no diversity of citizenship,

and all of th® decisions are to that effect.

48

And in answer to one of your earlier questions, Mr»
Justice White, you asked m© why isn’t it then that a plaintiff
could sue a third-party defendant if a third-party defendant
under the decisions could sue the original plaintiff.
QUESTION s

And if the third-party defendant is

from the same State as the plaintiff.
MR. SODOROs

Yes.

The reason for that is that

careful reading of the Kanrose v. Fred Whitaker case and what
we consider to he a very astute opinion by th© circuit judge
sets that out exactly and precisely as being a violation of th®
jurisdictional requirements set forth by Congress on Federal
courts.
QUESTION?
MR. SODORO:

You are saying again he can’t, but why?
1 am telling you that's that decision,

and as a lawyer I would like to think that m follow those
decisions.

When you say why, it is because th« Federal court,

your Honor, is a court of very limited jurisdiction.

And that

was such an important matter that th® framers and writers of
our Constitution in Article III make that recitation.

And. I

think that the history of the decisions by the Federal courts QUESTION:

Why may th© third-party defendant,

however, sue the plaintiff even though he is from the saas
State as the plaintiff?
MR. SODORO:

It appears that the rationale,or at

les.st the rationale I get from th© examination of the cases,

49
is th© plaintiff has s-al@ct©d the forum, and although it has
not made a direct claim against th© third-party defendant,- that
the third-party defendant, because ha is brought into the
cas© in which ha had no participation concerning the institutione
has that right as a matter of defense of this claim against
th© original defendant to counterclaim against th® plaintiff.
Gentlemen, I think I am out of time.

I wish to

thank you very much for your courtesy.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen

The case is submitted
(Whereupon, at 2%25 p.m., the oral arguments in
th© above-entitled matter war© concluded.)
