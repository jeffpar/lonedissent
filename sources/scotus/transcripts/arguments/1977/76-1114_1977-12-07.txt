MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-1114 and the consolidated cases, California against
Southland Royalty Company.
Mr. Barnett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY
COMMISSION
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
These cases involve oil and gas leases and the
extent of the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, formerly the Federal Power Commission, under
Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act.

Section 7(b), as set out

in tli© Appendix to our brief,provides, and I’d like to read it
in full since I think it's crucial to this case:
"No natural-gas company shall abandon all or any

r
portion of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission, or any service rendered by means of such facilities,
without the permission and approval of the Commission first
had and obtained , after due hearing, and a finding by the
Commission that the available supply of natural gas is depleted
to the extent that the continuance of service is unwarranted,
or that the present or future public convenience or necessity
permit such abandonment."

4
In tilias® cases a gas producer had laassd gas producing
property under a SO-year l@as© and had sold gas from that
property in interstate commerce, pursuant to a certificate of
public convenience«and necessity, issued by the Commission
without limit of time.
The question presented in the cas© is whether, when
th© 50-year term of the lease expires, the process of supplying
gas fron that property to interstate commerce may be terminated,
and th® gas produced from those reserves sold in intrastate
commerce) instead, without a requirement that either th© lessee
or the lassor obtain abandonment authorization from tea
Commission pursuant to Section 7(b) of th® Act,
The facts may b© briefly stated.
In 1925 Gulf Oil Corporation obtained an oil and
gas lease from the owners of th© Waddell ranch in Crane County
in West Texas, part of the Permian Basin,

Th® lease gave Gulf

th® exclusive right to explore for oil and gas on the Waddell
ranch, end to produce and market all th® oil and gas it might
find there for th© fixed term of 50 years,

Th© Isas© provided

that th® owners of th® Waddell ranch, th® lessors, would
receive a royalty from Gulf based on the quantity of natural
gas produced and the number of producing wells,
A year later, in 1926, the owners of the Waddell
ranch conveyed one-half of their mineral fee interest to
Southland Royalty Company, on© of the respondents here»

Other

5

shares in the mineral inters»t

under th® Waddell ranch wars

subs©q*af-mt.ly convoyed to & number of other owners.
At; present; the record discloses that Southland owns
47 percent; trustees under the will of W&rraa Wright own 26
percent; the Exxon Corporation swks 14 pereant.* and there ar®
more than 100 other owners.

I will rafsr at times to all those

owners collectively as Southlands
In 1951* Gulf entered into a contract with El Pas©
Natural Gas Company, an interstato pipeline, whereby Gulf
agreed to sell to El Paso surplus residua gas; that is* &
portion of the casinghead gas which comas from oil walls* as
distinguished from gas-well gas.

Gulf agreed to .sell to El

Paso surplus residua gas from th© Waddell lease and from other
sources„
In 1954* after this Court’s, decision in the Phillips

case* Gulf applied to the Federal Power Commission, as it then
was, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity
i

under Section 7(e) ©f the Natural Gas Act, authorizing it to
male© this sale to El Paso, and -dais certificate was granted
by the Commission in 1956.

Neither the application for the

certificate nor th© certificate itself provided for any limit
of time on th® sales or s@rv.ice boing authorized.
In 1972,

Gulf entered into a second similar contract

with El Paso for the sale of gas coming from th© Waddell lease
and other sources, Gtilf again applied for a certificate to the

6
Federal Power Commission, and again got; it; in 1973.
On July 14, 1975, the 50-year term of the Waddell
lease cam© to an end, and th© lease expired.

And title to th©

mineral astats in the Waddell ranch thus reverted to th©
reversionary mineral interest owners, Southland, at al.
Meanwhile there is also in this case the Goldsmith
leads.

Also in 1925, Gulf entered into a similar 50-year

fixed term oil and gas lease with Goldsmith and others ©n
th© Goldsmith ranch in Ector County, Tsxas, also West Texas.
Th® owners of th© Goldsmith ranch subsequently conveyed this
mineral interest to others, including the same Southland
Royalty Company, and including

Texaco, Inc., which now owns

one-fourth of the interest.
Gulf sold gas from the Goldsmith lease t© Phillips
Petroleum Company, which processed that gas and sold it to
El Paso for resale in interstet® commerce pursuant to
certificates that the Commission granted to El Pane.
In 1975, of course, th© Goldsmith lease also
expired, and title to th© mineral estate reverted to th©
reversionary mineral interest owners.
For the purposes of this case, th© parid.es are
agreed teat tea Waddell lease and th© Goldsmith lease, th©
Waddell ranch and th© Goldsmith ranch, and all the legal
ramifications ©f each have no legal differences, end thus I
will adopt the practice followed by Southland in its brief and

7
rofar at least som@id.msa to both, leases in. terms of the
Waddell lease.

I will always refer to th© lessee as Gulf,

although in fact there are soma oth@r minor lessees, and I
will sometimes refer to th® owners of the reversionary
mineral interests simply as Southland.
Nov?, the proceedings before the Commission —
QUESTION;

Mr. Barnett, right at that point, where

you're clarifying the parties, is it Gulf or the Southland said
Waddell people that, within your view of Section 7{b), is
th© natural gas company within the meaning of th© statute?
MR® BARNETT;

I plan -to get to that, Mr. Justice

Stevens,- but., in short, I think they both are.

But I will

expound on that a little more fully in & moment, if you Ilk®.
The proceedings
.follows;

before th® Commission were as

Shortly before th© end of the Waddell lease period

in 1975, Southland entered info a contract with Inferatax
Gas Company, and intrastate gas pipeline in Texas, whereby
Southland agreed to sell to Intx&tax, on the unregulated intrastat® market, gas from the Waddell lease after the lease
V

expired.
Needless to say, the intrastate price —- and that's
what thi.s case is all about, of course — tha intrastate price
is significantly higher than th® interstate pries regulated
by the Commission, at which th© gas Was being sold to El Paso.
In January 1975, having heard teat Southland was

B

solicit: .;ig proposals for intrastate sales of its gas, El Paso
petitioned the Commission.for a declaratory judgment as to
whether, when the Waddell leas© expired, Southland and the
other rower's ionary mineral interest owners would be entitled
to terminate the deliveries of Waddell ranch gas to El Paso,
and sell the gas instead on the intrastate market, without
getting the Commission's approval under Section 7(b)»
Texaco, as one-fourth owner of the reversionary
estate in the Goldsmith ranch,filed a similar petition for
declaratory judgment before th® Commission*
Since the cases war© so similar, th® Comaission
consoliented the two proceedings, since there were no issues
of fact, no evidentiary hearings were sought or held, various
parties intervened before the Commission,
The Commission issued its decision in July 1975,
It held that the various mineral interast reversioners may
not self gas frcm the reserves underlying the Waddell and
Goldsmith ranches in intrastate commerce without first
obtaining ibandoiiment authorisation from th® Commission, because,
the Commission held, that gas had bean dedicated -ao interstate
commarce by the certificated sales that th© lessees had made

to El Paso,
Th© Commission reasoned that under the decisions of
this Court th© dedication involved is not the dedication of an
individual party or producer, but th® dedication of gas,

Mt&

9
that; one® the services of supplying gars in interstate commerce
from specific acreage has commenced, quoting this Court’s
decisions in CATCO and Sunray, ’’there can be no withdrawal of
that supply from continued interstate movement without
Commission apprev&l.”

Th© Commission said?

This doss not mean wa are

modifying th© law of Texas as to tha leasehold rights, w<® are,
however, recognizing rights aad duties that have been created
by the Congress under th© Natural Gas Act.
Th® Commission therefore held, and this relates to
your question, Mr. Justice Stevens * that the reversionary
mineral interest owners and also Gulf were required to obtain
abandonment authority under Section 7 before ceasing the inter­
state sales.
1 don’t mean to say feat answers your question;
I propose to try to do so in a minute.

QUESTION;

It wasn’t on any agency theory, than,

it was ' list the idea that if fee lessee had dedicated it, it

was automatically dedicated when fe© lease ravertad?
MR. BARNETT;

That's correct.

Th© Commission’s

theory was feat it is a dedication of gas not a dedication of
any particular parson.

As it has otherwise been put, it’s an

in ram rather than in personam concept.

The gas is dedicated.

I will return to soma of th© ramifications of that.
On petition fcr rehearing» fee Commission essentially

10
adhered ■— the Commission did adhere to its findings and
conclusions, although adding some supplementary reasoning that
I think I nesd not recite.
Southland and the other reversionary interest owners
appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed
the Commission's orders,
Th© Court viewed th© issue of interstat© dedication
as controlled by local Texas law, noting teat "under applicable
Texas law, Gulf's rights were those of & tenant for a term of
years? its interest was a limited on© which terminated
completely when title reverted to Southland at fcha expiration
of a 50-year tern,"

Thus, "under well-established concepts

of property law, Gulf could not legally deal in or dedicate
that portion of tee gas which Southland might own upon
termination of Gulf's estate."
Thu Court reiterated teat under Texas lav? Gulf's
50-year leas® interest did not authorise it to impose any
limitation on the reversionary ©state, and that under Texas
property law Gulf could not bind the reversionary ost&te by
its actions.

Unquote,

Th© Court thus concluded that by virtu© of local law
th® reversioners were free to cess® th® service to El Paso
and its interstate customers, and to sell the gas from these
reserves in intrastate commerce after expiration of th© leas©.
Petitions for certiorari wera filed in this Court

11
by th© Commission and also by El Paso? in the State of California.
The Court granted th® petitions and consolidated tie cases»
Well, in the first place? w© submit that the css® is
controlled by the plain language of Section 7(b). That
language provides ? "No natural-gas company shall abandon all or
any portion of its facilities subject to th® jurisdiction of
th® Commission? or any service rendered by means of such
facilities, without" first obtaining abandonment authorisation
from the» Commission»
QUESTION i

1 suppose the key words are "subject to

th© jurisdiction of the Commission”, is that- not. so?
MR. BARNETT £
Justice.

Well, I don't, think so? Mr» Chief

I would say the key words are "servies" — th© key

word is "service”.

It is clear her® that, what El Paso was

doing was subject to the jurisdiction of th® Commission»

That

was a servies} indeed? I don* t take it. to be denied by our
opponent;?! that El Pas© was performing a service subject to the
jurisdiction of tha Commission? within the language ©:c Section
7(b)»

They do? I assume? raise a question —
QUESTIONs

You don't mean to suggest that El Pas©

was one of th© natural gas companies re far seed to —
MR. BARNETT:

Gulf, I*ia sorry.

Did I say El Paso?

I should have said

Thank you»

QUESTIONt

Okay,

MR. BARNETTs

I don’t take it — I think• it could not

12
be denied, end is not; denied, that; Gulf was perforating a
servies® subject -to the jurisdiction of the Commission by the
sales it was making to El Paso under ilia lease.

Given that,

service, and the Court has emphasised in th® Sunray case the
importance of the servies concept under Section 7(b).
The Court there said that it is a servic® not just
& sale that the Commission authorizes when it grants a
certificate under Section 7(e).
In the Xasiguaga quoted

-in our brief at page 11#

it is evident that all the matters for which a certificate is
required must be justified in terms of a service to which
they relate.
Thust
QUESTIONi

Mr. Barnett# just, because you focus on

th® statutory language# which interest® me too, the word
* service" is followed by "rendered by means of such facilities55 e
MR. BARNETTS
QUESTION*

Yes,

and th© 'such facilities* in turn refer

back to "its facilities".

If you talk .about Gulf, -the service

would here to b© services rendered through facilities of Gulf,
wouldn’t they?

By just reading th© plain language of the statute.
MR. BARNETTs

"No natural-»gas company shall abandon

all or any portion of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction
of the Commission, or any" — well, X think Gulf’s facilities

13
clearly ware.

Gulf had a processing plani:, it ha.d pipeline

connections with El Paso, and with these gas walls,
QUESTION;

Well, is it your position Gulf was

obligated te continue; providing th@ service?
HR, BARNETT:

Yes*

Well, let ms now

me now to your question, Mr, Justice Stevsns,

this brings
I have just

argued that it would seem clear hero, and 1 would think not
denied, that Gulf was performing a servito subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission,
However, it might bo argued, and our opponents
apparently do argue, that you also have to have a natural gas
company <»a the premises. That 7<b) says "no natural-gas
company shall abandon", and Southland at least argues that
it is net; a natural gas company for th© purposes of this case,
Sad thus I com© to the question you raised earlier, and I think
there axa several answers,

One ia that Gulf is * natural gaa

company, clearly, for th«a purpasss of this case,
Th®i Commission, in its torti ficato, granted to Gulf
for thesu sales, specifically held -that the. applicant is a
natural gas company,
Moreover, I take the *—
QUESTION:
MR, BARNETT:

Stop right there for just a momento
Yes,

QUESTION: fth&t does that mean?
must continue? to provide the gas?

Poes that; mean Gulf

14
MR* BARNETTs Well, the Commission held in its order
hare that neither Gulf nor Southland may abandon this service
without Commission authority„ To that extent it means Gulf
must continue to provide the gas, yes„
QUESTIONS But Gulf doesn't have the leas®, Gulf's
less© has expired0
MR0 BARNETTs

That’s true.

Gulf and Southland

might have a cause of action between each other? but for
purposer of the — regulatory purposes of the Natural Gas Act,
Gulf having bean performing this service subject to the
jurisdiction of the Act was held not to bo aisle to abandon it
without
QUESTIONj

What if Gulf simply — it wasn't a

queritiox of reversion of the lease, but Gulf had 30ms oil
fields end they simply ran out?

Would it still be obligated

to continue furnishing that service?
MR0 BARNETTs Well, it might be obligat©! to go to the

Comifiissi.cn and seek abandonment, and I ass tame the Commission
would

ay,inft it, if the

oil w©lls ran out*

But, in any ©vent,

that's a. different, case, because hare you have a continually
flowing strenra, which did not run out*

Which is being stopped

and diverted to intrastate conserca»
And the Commission held «— this is at pago 608 of
the Appendix ■*>” with respect to holding that Gulf must seek
abandonment as well as the reversioners*

la our opinion, this

15
is not. a mere technical requiremenb# but; would allow us to
pass upon the merits of the lessee's abandonments upon th®
termination of th® 50~y©ar leases, as wall as the proposed
abandonment of th® reversioners,
But I don 1 t take th® position# Mr, Justice Stevens#
that that's th® only answer to the question.

While we do

submit that Gulf is a natural gas company for ‘th© purpose of
having to g© to th© Commission before abandoning this particu­
lar service# we also submit that Southland is a natural gas
company for this purpose,
Now# Southland says# "We’rs not, a natural gas company#
because we wore not engaged in selling gas subject to the
Commission's jurisdiction# ua wore just receiving royalties,"
QUESTION:

And Southland didn’t procsss either#

did it?
HR, BARNETT:
is true.

But

Southland didn’t process either# that

—

QUESTION:

If it didn't process — wouldn’t it be

pretty herd to have a gas* company that didn't process?
MR, BARNETT:
QUESTIONs

Excuse ma# Mr, Justice?
Isn’t if- difficult to have a gas company

if th® company doesn't procsss?
MR, BARNETT:

Well# I would not. assert that they

ar® a ga? company here? because they didn't process# I would
assert thsy era m. natural gas company here because they as.*© th©

16
party who now controls a service in natural gas which is
subject to th® Commission's jurisdiction, and which Section
7(b) says may not b© abandoned without the Commission’s
approval.
It would h® an anomalous and wholly self-destructive
interpretation of Section 7(b), I submit, to -- really to say,
either now you have a service which Section 7(b) says may not
be abandoned without the Commission's approval, still the
party who controls that service happens not to

be a natural

gas company and therefore the:?© is no way that the Commission
can effectuate the result that Section 7(b)
QUESTION:

commands.

Well now, the Commission could have

required the consent of Southland at the tims that it issued
th© original certificate, couldn’t it?
MRs BARNETTs

At the time it issued the certificate

to Gulf, it could hava required th© consent of Southland?
QUESTION:

Yes.

If it said, "We see you’ve just

got a 5C-year lease, and wa think w® may want service furnished
beyond that”, they can requires th© application by Southland
to accompany that of Gulf, couldn't it?
MR» BARNETT;

Th© certificate provided for no

limited time. The application provides for no limited time»
By the same token, Southland could have written into its
contract-, with Gulf, its leas© with Gulf, that ”if you go apply
for a certificate, you msk® clear that you are only applying-

17
for a 50-year certificate*”
QUESTIONs Well; can't the Commission in its pro-"
osedings on tfce application ask the necessary questions and
develop the necessary information to find out hovr long the
lease its of the natural gas company, and if there s.re
reversionary interests , require that the owners of the
reversionary interest join in the application?
MR* BARNETT:
future*

Well; it perhaps could do that in the

In this cas© the application was for an unlimited

certificate.

The Commission may well have assumed, on the

basis of cases like Sunray, that the certificate is unlimited
when it nays it’s unlimited, and that just as a contract of
twenty years was held in Sunray not fee limit the term of the
dedication, so a lease hex’© doesn't*
QUESTION:

Mr. Bamratt, it. often happens that gas

companies ; get in a fight over who really owns the land, who
r@al.ly I..is a valid lease*

Suppose Gulf want to the Commission

and got "hcs certificate, but Litigation started as to who
really had a valid lease, and it's determined in court that
Gulf had no lease at all?

I suppose you would say that Gulf

world have to ask to terminate the service, but you wouldn't
oay thin’

the Commission would deny a termination, would you?
MR. BARNETT:

No, I would think, on those facts, the

Commission would grant the termination and substitute whoever
tbs court has found

— whomever the court has found to be the

18

actual lasses.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but that psrson, suppose
that person who owns it hasn't any interest in continuing th®
service?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Well, ~~
Wants to sell in intrastate commerce,

hasn't any interest in doing what Gulf had been doing.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Well, if it
laid it*a th© owner of the less©.

MR. BARNETT:

Well, if you*ra suggesting that Gulf's

application to the Commission on your facts was wholly un~
authorised, Gulf was a sort of squatter on th© land and had
no authority from —
QUESTION:

T© show good faith., just like a lot of

people do, they just get in a title question.
MR. BARNETT:

Oh, wall, I think in that casts tha

Commissisn might find that tha original dedication was not
authorised by the landowner, and in that case might set aside
th© original dedication.
QUESTION: Well, you said a moment ago that th© theory
of the Commission wasn't agency, but sow, I mean, that's
Justice White's question, it sounds like you*re saying it was
th© agency.
MR, BARNETT:

Where there has once been a dedication

of a stream of gas, the Commission ~~ an authorised dedication,

19
anyway* of a s tea am of gas —
QUESTION:

Yes* but there Isn’t anybody* nobody

you can’t say Gulf* in ray example, is authorised by anybody?
th© landowner is «=- it’s determined that Gulf doesn’t hold the
lease* but some other company holds th.® lease* and has th®
right ‘ho dedicate the gas*
MR® BARNETT:
dedication®

Well* that’s why I said an authorized

In that casa there would not. have been an

authorised dedication in the cirsfc place, and th© -~
QUESTION: So th© service could be discontinued?
MR® BARNETT:

Well, you might well have to go to

th© Commission to do so, but I should think that, on those
facts the Commission would find that sine© there had bean no
authorised sal© or service in th© first place, the application
was fraudulent in a sense®
QUESTION:

So you must say, than* that Southland

hex© implicitly authorized thsa dedication?
MR® BARNETT:

Yes, I would say implicitly, by

virtue of what Its authorized lessee did®
QUESTIONs

Now, is that th® theory that the Commis-

sion used?
MR® BARNETT:

Well, in a, sense, yes, I think the

Commission’s theory is that this gas was dedicated to intar-*
state e'en snare© by th© sales and service which Gulf performed
pursuant; to th© Commission’s certificate. Everything Gulf did

20

was not only normal but: proper end required of it under its
leas© , a',id *>-*
QUESTION?

Wei1r it certainly didn’t us© th© thsory

that Southland was a gas company, did it?
MRc BARNETTi

Well, the Commission didn’t, spacifically

address the question of who is a natural gas company and why?
it held that Southland and Gulf both are, for purposes of
having to corns to the Commission to get abandonment, authority.
And I would submit, as I already have, that Gulf

clearly is.

I think Southland also is, by virtue of control Ling

the servies.
In the Unitad Gas Pipeline case of a few years ago,
this Court was faced with a question whether -« in that case
a producer didn't want, to buy any more gas from a particular
field, mid the Commission •— and the Court held that its
refusal to keep purchasing wan an abandonment, ordered him
to keep purchasing, and the objection was mades
this Court get the authority to order a purchase?
Court answered:

where doss
And the

Where it is necessary to regulate the purchase

©f gas in soma respects to carry out the expressly granted
authority over transportation and sales, the Commission must
have the- power to do so.

Undoubtedly the continued purchase ©f gas has been
"■•rdvrscl, but only as an incids&t to regulating transportation
and al®a *

Similarly here —'

QUESTION:

What are you reading from there?

HR. BARNETTi

Unload Gas Pip® Lin® Co. vs. FPC? 385

0»S9 at 90, cited in El Paso’s brisf at pag® 29*
Similarly here, in order to effectuate its jurisdic­
tion over the service that does exist, the Commission, if
nedess&ry, would have to b® able to assort personal jurisdic­
tion over Southland to hold the abandonment proceeding.
But# as I’ve said, Gulf also is a natural gas company,
as yet a third point on this, it should be noted how carefully
Southland qualified its statainsant in its brief at. page 16,
thafit, "has not at any time been a natural gas company with
respect'- so ite Waddell ranch gas".
Well, now, some of the reversioners here clearly ex®
natural gas companies with respect to other gas,
it ebke&les :so in tfc© record at Appendix page 218,

Texaco is,
Exxon,

which owns 14 percent of tfc® Waddell interest, is? it concedes

so in ‘.t3 c rs; 3sc: at pag© 443, And, although it is not in th©
record.»' :.fc is implied by Southland’s statement, which I just
read, and I am informed that Southland is also a natural gas
company»

That is, does sell «gas in interstate comm©res

pursuant: to Commission certificate with respect to other gas.
That would

ta&ke more than 50 -percent of the — more

f&en 60 percent of th® owners of the Waddell ranch who are
natural' gas ^oopanies,

Th® facts of this case

However, we believe that; th© decision of th© court

Factually, California receives —■
QUESTIONs

What do you mean; whan you say you're her®

to plead it on policy grounds'?
MR, DEUTSCHs

I'm sorry, sir, what I mean is that we

certainly agree with th® statements that tee Solicitor has
made as to the law of the case.

What I wanted to bring to

th© Court's attention was the various situations in the inter­
state gas market today,
QUESTIONi

It will have soma relation, I take it,

to tee e statute or administrative law in question, then?
MR, DEUTSCHs

Yes, Justice Rehnquist.

Factually, th© State of California receives approxi­
mately 90 percent of its gas from tee interstate market.

Our

major supplier- c-f that gas is El Paso Natural Gas Company,
Under tea facts of this case, if the decision of tea
lower court is upheld, some 35 million cubic fast a day of gas
will be lost to the El Paso system, without tee abandonment
authorisation.

This is sufficient to heat approximately

120,000 homes,
California would receive approximately 75 percent of
that g&c! under normal circumstances.

27
But; we believe that; th® theory of this —
QUESTIONS

Actually# what will happen fco -that gas

if you lose?
MR» BEUTSCH:

It's my understanding that that gas

has already been contracted in intrastate commarce within the
State of Texas# and I h&v© no id©a what the us© of that gas

QUESTION;

Do you think we should hava an interest

in being sure it; goes to California instead of to Texas?
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTIONs
MR» DEUTSCH;

No# sir? not at all»
Then what's your argument?
My argument is that# first of all#

this gas goes to all the States on the El Paso system? but#
more is?-<>:rtanfcly, th© theory of the case to be applied# not
only to these two fixed*-term leases but to all types of leases,
including 1,1 fe-of-production leases»

Therefore, that the

facts C'f — or th© theory of the case could be applied to
cause the loss of a great deal more gas from the interstate
system, end this is inopposite to one of the basic protections
of the consumer in th© United States under the Natural Gas Act,
which is fco have an assurance of an adaquat® and reliable
supply of gas in interstate service.
t

And in deciding this case, California believes that
th© Cour; should consider the purpose for which the Natural Gas
Act was enacted, and the impact th© decision of this Court will

28

have on the consumers of th® United States»
In deciding that, w® would like to bring t.o your
attention two facts* or two factors in the gas market -today
that will be —* that have an affect on this case and have an
effect on the Cornnission*s ability to insure a continuing,
reliable and adequate supply of gas in the interstat® market«,
That’s trie shortages ©£ natural gas in the interstate market
and the disparity of price in th© interstate —- between the
interstate and intrastate markets.
California, receiving over 90 percent of its gas
from th© interstate market,' has found that there has been a
significant decline in gas;,

nan© 9 percent a year, dedicated

to that market, and'subsequently declining supplies to
■ California.
This is true for th& United States. And this is shown
by Idle m iei briefs of Now York and th© Associated Gas
Producers.
Thcs shortages, I think th© effect of th® shortages,
were dramatically shown in th© winter freeze ©£ 1976, where
natural, gas did not get to the northern tier States •

It has

an immediate effect on the health, well-being and economic
viability of th® gas' consumers«
Mow, a major reason for these shortages is the
disparity in price between the interstate and intrastate
markets.

The intraskata market, of course, is unregulated.

29
and th© pric® has been as high as over two dollars a thousand
cubic fecit,®

The ceiling pric® in inters tat© market is $1.44«

California is nob h<ar® to disparage the fundamental
economic motivation of someone to sell their gas at the highest
price possible®

What; we're bringing to the Court's attention

is that the chronic shortages in the interstat® market, combined
with the disparity of price, and add-ad to this motivation to
sell gar; at th© highest, price possible, puts untenable
pressuros on th© Commission to uphold th© fundamental protection,
which is to insure a continuing, adequate and reliable supply
©f gas in interstate service.
QUESTION;

Untenable pressures on to© Public

Utilities Commission of California or th© Federal Power -what used to be to® Federal Power Commission?
MR» DEUTSCll:

The Federal Power Commission, Justice

Rshnquisto.
In the 1950's, it was in th© interest of producers
to sell their gas in th© interstate market»

In 1977, it is

in their interest to soil th© gas in th© intrastate* market»
And we"-believe that the d@cS.sion of th© court below
applied to leases gives producers just th© vehicle 'that they
need to carry out their economic interest to determine, to be
able to take gas from.' interstato commerce either now or some-*
tim© during to© life of production and move that to intrastate
commerce without worrying about the public interest, end with-

30
out having the Commission being able to determina the public
convenience and necessity of whether this gas can be removed
from interstate commarceo
QUESTION s

And we think this violates ~~

Wall, 1 understood the government to

say that they were trying t© do just what you* r© talking about.
That the Energy Commission was trying to do just what you say
they * re not doing.
MR. DEUTSCHs

I’m sorry, Justice Marshall?

Are you saying the Energy Commission is

having pressure put on them to stop them from doing what you
want them to do?
MR. DEUTSCHs
QUESTION*

But we think that ~-

Is that, what you’re saying?

MR„ DEUTSCHt

Well, what I’m saying is that the

Commission has a duty to insure an adequate supply of gas in
the interstate market.

.I’m saying that the chronic shortages

which me! i it & seller’s market, combined with tints case,
allow producers —* giv© producers an opportunity to move their
gas from th© interstate market, to th© intrastate market? or,
in th©' futura, to make leases that give them that opportunity.
And -Shis is th© pressure put on the Commission, and the
Commission has the duty to. insure that there's an adequate
supply in th© interstate market, and not to allow this
abandonment unless the gas wall has been depleted or ~
QUESTIONs

Well, ara you criticizing what th®

31

Commission did in this cose or not?
MR. DEUTSCH;

No.

QUESTIO*?: Well, wha.i;’s your argument?
MR. DEUTSCH s

My argument is that th© decision of

the court below applied *— can ba applied to all forms of
leases, ..and -that theory concerning 1® asses, which allows leases
to b© drawn up, which would avoid Section ?{b) abandonment
provisionsf —
QUESTION: All I*ei keying to say is, I'm trying to
/

find out what legal arguments you have, other than policy.
MR. DEUTSCHs

Well, my legal argument is, as th®

Solicitor has stated, that gm cannot b® removed — Section
7(b) says gas cannot b© removed from interstate commerce
once it has been dedicated, without a Section 7(b) abandonment
author!sation.
The gas in this cases was dedicated to interstate
commerce, an unlimited certificate wise given, Gulf had th©
right to dedicate all that gas; in fact, Gulf —* if fee
production circumstances had bean different, Gulf could have
sold all of that gas. before th® termination of th® fifty
years o

And th® reversionary raineral interest owners had only 1

a future;) expectation»

Until that vested at th® end of fcha

fifty years, they did not knot? what gas would be left»

All

of that gas was in fact dedicated te th© interstate market end
could hum been produced and cold in the interstate market,

32
and under the clear language of Section 7(b), that gas, once
dedicated, for whatever reason, no matter how justified the
reason, cannot, be removed from inters tat© commarce in the
first inBtan.ce until the Commission, within its jurisdiction,
has determined that abandonment can be made.
QUESTION;

So it all turns on the interpretation

of this on© section?
MR. DEUTSCHs

Yes, it dose.

I believe so.

I would like to turn to two points raised by
respondents in this case.

Tha first is that leases could not

be made i±at would terminate prematurely natural gas service
in interstate commerce because It would be against the economic
interest ©£ the producer to do so, because of th© initial
cost of production.
I would lika to make several comments cn that.
First of all, we have the possibility of leas®
situations that affect adversely tha consumer, ©van though they
don’t necessarily affect; th® producer.

And w© see this ia

casas now in the court below, on© in the Fifth Circuit
concerning the area of royalty gas, where th© issue is whether
the, royalty payment to a lessor should b© based on tha intra™
stat® or interstate price of gas.

And & secondary issue

th©ra tv. whether th© gas ™~ tha lessor can terminate tha lease,
thereby causing the gas to revert back to the lessor if the
lesser does not receive the value that h® thinks he should.

33

Under the ©hroy of this case, that would avoid th© abandonment
provision.
Another factual situation concerns a lessor’s ability
to retain a royalty interest with th© right to convesci that
into a working interest, a situation that arose in the Tenth
Circuit in th© Phillips Petroleum case.

In that css© th©

lessor did convert th© gas into a working interest, and
attempted to sell it as new gas in interstate commerce without,
seeking abandonment authorisation.
Nov/, the Tenth Circuit held that that gas was
dedicated.

But I think there's no guarantee that other courts

of appeals would also hold that, ©specially if, in this case,
th® Fifth Circuit is upheld.
Thera are other situations involving termination for
lack of production.

A producer with a marginal well could

find it in his best interest to simply abandon that well,
allowing

th© gas lease to terminate, and ho could move on to

mora productive areas«

But that avoids Section 7(b) abandon-*

merit, and perhaps the Commission would find that it's in th©
public Interest to produce that marginal gas, that that producer
is still getting a fair rata of return.
And one over**all comment in this area, and one l*d
like to emphasizs to th© Court, it's a seller's market.
is a tremendous chronic shortage of natural gas.

There

Whether

producers like it or not, whether the Commission likes it or

34
not, if the theory of this csss, that leases can avoid Section
7(b) abandonment authorization, is upheld, I think w© will
find a great many leases that include provisions that allow
for termination if certain circumstances occurred during the
production and. the life of tha less©, and neither the Commis­
sion nor producers will h@ abi© to d© anything about it.
Because those are the types of leases they are faced with»
One last point concerning the issue raised about
cloud on real property in the Stmt® of Texas»
First, what w© psrcoiva here is a congressional
regulatory requirement placed on interstate gas serviceo
do not see the cloud on real os tats title»

We

That gas has

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. EVANS ATTHBLL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF SOUTHLAND ROYALTY COMPANY, ET AL»
HR» ATTWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

th© Court:
My name is Evans Atuwell, and I appear her© on behalf
of th© respondents Southland Royalty Company, et al.
I would like to start out by briefly summarising our
position in what we’re asking this Court to hold? then I want

35

to turn to the reasons why Southland's gm was not involuntarily
dedicated to interstate service, because Gulf mad© an inter-­
state sale of Gulf's share of the Waddell ranch gas? and then
finally I want to conclude with a discussion of the practical
consequences of tills Court holding fox' Southland*
Our position is very simple, but it's very fundamental*
It is that you can't sell what you never owned, nor can you
dedicata what you n©vsr owned*

This is true as a matter of

property law? and it is also true under the National Gas Act*
Therefore, this casta doss not, present a conflict
between : State property law on the on© hand and the Natural
Gas Act on the other.

Nor dswss it involve the withdrawal or

diversion of dedicated gas from the interstate market.
We recognise that if our gas has bean dedicated,
then, in the words of Justice Brennan, in Sua.ray, there can
be no wi thdrawal of that, supply from continued interstate
movement without Commission approval.
But non® of Southland's gas has ever flowed in
interstate commerce, except under compulsion ©f the Commission's
ordars in this case, and those orders expressly provide that
such forced sales by Southland are without prejudice to its
rights in this case.
Thera fora, the question before the Court is whether
Southland’s share of the Waddell ranch gas was somehow
dedicate cl to interstate service because Gulf made an interstate

36
salsa of Its sh&ra of th© Waddell ranch, gas.
We recognize and agree that this dedication question
is to be decided under th® Natural Gas Act.

We say that

\

because Gulf was never ~~ and 1 emphasise th® word "never" —
possessed ©£ any rights in or control ovsr Southland’s
interest in the Waddell ranch gas# it could not and did not
encumber that gas with an interstate service obligation.

where we left off before the luncheon recess.

If I understood

We thinJ; it's very dear, from the Natural Gas Act,
that Congress didn't say feat.

HR. ATWELL:

[Laughter.1
QUESTION:

Mr. Attwall, while you’re interrupted,

assume for the moment that Gulf was under an obligation to
apply for an abandonment, because they had a certificate and
in effect thsir interest in the leasehold was going to run
out.

They had an obligation to do so and they failed to do so.

What would the consequences b<s?
MR. ATWELL:

Well, they would have violated the

rules and regulations of the Commission and of course the
Natural Gas Act gives the Commission the remedial power.

But

the truth of the matter is •»QUESTION: Remedial power to do what?

MR. ATTWELL:

Remedial power to either punish Gulf

or to make them, fore® them to file.

And 'the proof of the

matter in this case, Justice Stevens, is that Gulf filed an
application to abandon over tec years ago, and it’s been
sitting up at tea Federal Power Commission, and nothing has
happened.
QUESTION:

Is that —» does the record show that?

MR. ATTWELL:

I b@li.ev© it does, yes, sir.

In fact,

I believxa it was filed pursuant to the very orders that are

QUESTIONS

But; you’re saying that the remedy

if

they were under a duty to — if they acted properly by filing
the request to abandon and if th® Commission didn’t, act on it,
and they went ahead and abandoned anyway, without action, they
may be subject to som© penalty? that’s what you’re saying?
MR. ATTWELL%

Well, I’m saying they are not subject

to any penalty for abandonmentr because all the gas that Gulf
had ways sold and delivered to El Paso.

It completely performed

the servies.
It was just like, I believe Justice Relinquish asked
the question:

what would happen if you just ran out of gas?

If Gulf had just run out?
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s what happened,

Well, under the statuto, even if you

run out, you have to file a petition to abandon, don't you?
MR. ATTWELL:

That is correct, and 'they had filed

And it’s bean pending there for two years.
But that’s a

I’ll admit that's a pro forma, because

the statute says if your reserves are depleted to the extent
that further service is unwarranted, end presumably Gulf meets
that stumd&ri.

But an application to abandon has been filed,

it is pending. So I don’t think that that's — it’s mors or
less a technical point.

I think that the decision of the Taxas Supreme Court,
that I rtsferred to, a 1973 decision, which conclusively
established the limitations on Gulf's power under its Isas®,
conclusively established that. El Paso — I mean that Gulf had
absolutely no power under that lease to dedicate Southland’s
gas also is a full and complete answer to any suggestion that
Southland is a suecessory interest to Gulf and therefore
bound by Gulf's dedication of Gulf’s gas.
A successor, of course, is one who acquires his
pr©dec©s£ or*;? astata end takes that estate subject to any
bene?fils

or Infirmities.
But in this cas® wh«n Gulf’s lease expired, it

ceased f; - exist. There was nothing left. These was nothing to
b© trang'l:arrad.

Southland didn’t acquire Gulf’s lease

voluntarily or otherwise.

Southland had a continuing presently

vested property interest.
I think that the Texas Supreme Court decision is also
an answsi.r as to whether or not there was seme? type of agency
und r which Gulf acted in this case.

I think it’s clear from

45
this record and from the law that Gulf had absolutely no
agency whatsoever to act: on behalf of Southland Royalty»
Now, in the past, to© Commission has consistently
recognised that a producar can't dedicate what: it doesn't «a,
In fact» just 45 days ago* the. new Comiaissioa reversed a
decision by to® old Commission and held that when Producer ft
dedicated his reserves, interest in & gss reserve, it didn't
dedicate Producer B’s, because Producer A had no authority to
dedicat» Producer Q*s gas, and it had no ownership right in it»
But, in this case, toe Commission has, for to© first
time, to our knowledge, ignored to® fundamental principle and
held that whan Gulf made an inters tot© sal© of its gas it
could Mid did dedicate our gats, even though Gulf never had any
ownership or other interest, of any kind»
In so holding, ws submit to® Commission clearly
exceded its authority under the Natural Gas Act»
First, v® believe it’s clear our gas was not ~QUESTION%

You mean even prospectively, as wall ©s

otherwise?
MR* ATWELL:
QUESTION:
happened tomorrow.

I don't follow that»

Well, suppose toe s&ms transaction
Every lessor then knows what toe Commission*s

rule is.
MR» ATTWELLs

That’s a good point»

QUESTION: And so, are you saying that, if — suppos®

46
the Commission had gone through a rule-making proceeding and
made thirs supplemental piece of legislation and had said —
and put ^ut a regulation, put out a regulation that, this is
the way .'Leases vrill ba constxaed or applied, or this is what
the Natural Gas Act means?

Or at least that this is the

regulation?
I suppose you would be arguing liar®, from what you
just said, that that would be contrary t» the Natural Gas Act?
MR® ATTWELLi
clear, Justice White.

Absolutely• And let me make one thing
And the record in this case shows it.

One, fixed-term leases, of the kind we’re dealing
with hasta, are unique animals.

They went into disuse in the

lata 1920’s, and the reason they went into disuse is because
producers ar-s just not going to undertake investing hundrads
of hhou&:mds or millions ©f dollars in a wall and not ba
entitled -to produce all of the gas that comes out of the well.
They went into disuse jisp the modern-day lease provides that
the: producer’s lease rights continue so long &s production
continues

in paying quantities.
So you’ r© not faced with the specter ©f this

happening, of these things coming up from the past,,

More or

lass like! when you issued your Sunray decision, you

wore

contemporaneously faced with the spaetar of the Sun Oil
decision, with these old certificates coming up, and if you
didn’t held as you did in Sunray then those older certificates

47
would her/© fcorminatsdc
QUESTION: What I don’t understand is why tha original
agreement with Gulf, th@ original dedication didn’t say
specifically that ”We are dedicating only th© gas that we have

QUESTION:

And as those leases ran out, their

dedication .ran out.

MR® ATTWELL:

As tie gas ran out, that's righto

That was the end of it.
QUESTION:

That's your position.

QUESTION:

You*ra saying ’this situation is analogous

to a person who has a 50 or a 30~y®ar lease on a building# or
a piece of land# for traditional purposes, not gas and oil,
and h© lias no power to do anything with it except to sail that
lease term?

MR. ATTWELL:

I couldn't hav® said it better Eiysalf.

That's exactly what we’re saying.

QUESTION:

But you did concede that if there were an

option for a renewal or extension, that that would be part of
the original estate?

MR. ATTWELL:

I did.

Whatever Gulf owned. It is

our position that it’s what Gulf owned at the time of dedica­
tion the.-; determined fch® s copra and extent of the dedication.
And all Gulf owned was the right to produce gas from the
Waddell ranch for a defined 50-year term.
QUESTION: Could I ask you — in asking this question,

I'm not assuming that the Commission was correct, or that it's
legally correct, but 1st: m© ask you this:

Was it foreseeable

that th*j Commission was going to rule this way?

MR. ATTWELL%
QUESTIONt

We would certainly say that# yes.

In ©th@r words* you would say that wa

ware engaging in a rule-making procase.

MR. ATTWELLs
QUESTION t

I would say that.
Da facto rule-making„

MR. ATTWELLs

Correct.

Th-s Commission's reliance on Justice Brennan's
Suaray opinion to support its flow theory we believe is
equally misplaced in this casts, because the record clearly
shews that. Southland has never sold any of its gas voluntarily
at least in interstate commerce.
Th® only physical flow that Gulf could and did
dedicatu to interstat® service was Gulf's leasehold gas, a
50-year flow. And one© Gulf commenced that flow, -the service
had to continue.

Sunr&y made it very clear that it couldn't

withdraw that supply, and Gulf has delivered all of its
leasehold gay.

But now Gulf's supply is gone, it flowed and

has gom T and they've applied for abandonment.
But, that in no way supporto?, the Commission's position

that Gulf's flow ©£ Gulf gas somehow bound Southland.
New, w© also xecognis® that under Sunray, the
certiflc&t® issued to Gulf incased a service obligation that

was obvit-usly separat® and apart from the sales obligation
imposed by its contract.

But Gulf's service obligation applied

51
only to Gulf’s share of the Waddell ranch,
The capacity of a producar to dedicate natural gas
reserves, w@ say, is limitsd to the producer’s ownership rights
in such reserves, and doesn’t ©xtssnd to gas which th® producer
never had any ownership or other interest in,
Let mt illustrat» that by saying feat throughout fee
industry it’s very commonplace for there t» b© a number of
different interest owners in gas reserves, in fact feat’s a
lot more common than th© contrary.

And it has been well

established feat if on© producer in feat gas reserve makes a
sal® of tils interest, it in no way binds or covers fee other
produce:^;.

And w® say that’s exactly the same thing here.

Hery it’s fee Waddell gas, fee Waddall ranch, Gulf makes a
sal© of its interest? feat’s in no way blading on us.

We say

feat’s exactly analogous.
Nor is it significant, we submit, that Gulf was
issued c. certificate of unlimited duration in this cas®.

That

simply manant that Gulf was obligated to sell all of its
Waddell ranch gas that it own&d.

It didn’t mean feat Gulf was

somehow authorized to sail gaa it didn’t own.
W® would not® feat what is involved in this case is
far different from what faced you in Sunray.

In feat case this

Court required th® producer to continue selling his own gas,
aftsr th© term of his contract:, because of th© sarvic©
obligation imposed by his certificate.

In Sunray, fee producer

52

clearly had the right, end the power to continue to sell his
gas after the contract expired.
By contrast, in the present case, Gulf never had any
pov/ar or right iso sell Waddell ranch gas after its lease
expired.

Therefor®, Gulf's service obligation could not have

extended to Southland's ges„
Gulf was not able, in fact, te sell Southland's gas.
In ray remaining time, I'd like to turn to the
practical consequences of holding for Southland in this case*
First» I think, &s far as this narrow case is
concerned, the consequences a:;1© da minimi

There's this

cases, and there are only threo other fixed-term lease casas,
and tfee relative volumes of g.;is, compared to the over-all, are
da minimis»
Second, holding for Southland in this case will not
m@a|i that gas dedicated under the typical life-of-reserves
lets© a -• aid ©scape from interstate service if such a lease is
prematurely terminated.

All that the Court need hold — and

we say should hold in this cac© — is that one who has never
had any interest in or control over gas cannot dedicat® that
gas to interstate service.

The typical li£e-o£-reserves lease

is ©f unlimited duration, and, unlike Gulf in this case# the
produce;-; has the power s± th© tiro® of dedication to dedicate
whatever gas ha finds,
I don't, think the petitioners ra&lly take the firm

53
position that holding la this css© would reach that result;
th&y say the theory of this case might b® expanded to bind
these ordinary lease situations , where te® producer has the
power which, unlike Gulf in this case to dedicat® gas, does
dedicate the gas; and then th® leas® is prematurely terminated*
We don*t believe this Fifth Circuit’s decision goes
that far* We think it*B clear teat the Fifth Circuit’s decision
is based on tea fact that Gulf had no interest in or control
over our gas reserves.

In fact, that’s th© basis on which

the Tente Circuit distinguished it.

Mr. Deutsch, on behalf

of California, referred you to a recent Tenth Circuit decision,
in which the Commission had held that gas was dedicated, and
Phillips; Petroleum Company appealed to the Tenth Circuit and
th© Commission was affirmed.

And th® Tenth Circuit said

Southland is not applicable, because in that case th© lessee,
Gulf Oil, naver at any time had any interest in or control
over Southland's gas.
QUESTIONs What about the lease?

Couldn't Gulf say,

KX will dedicat® all of th® oil teat I will get under my 50-year
lean© with the Waddell ranch"?
MR, ATTWELLs

Justice Marshall, that’s exactly what

they did say.
QUESTION*

Yes, well, I thought you said teat they

didn’t have any gas; teat Gulf didn’t have any.
MR. ATTWELi;

I*m saying teat after fifty years, they

V
54
had absolutely no Interest in any gas produced in the Waddell
ranch
QUESTION:

Oh - I SS9.

MRc ATWELL:

If I misspoke myself, I apologis©»

In any event, if there*s any question obviously
in this Court’s mind as to th® extent of th® opinion below,
it can obviously limit it to -the issue** presented in this css a,
which is whether on® who has no interest in or control

-over gaa

can dedicate that gas to interstate service«
Such a holding, w@ submit, would fo@ entirely
consists^;it with th® contrary holding, if this Court were of
that opinion, in these other cases»
a

Third, it’s our position that holding for Southland
in -his case is not going to in any way result in this parade
of horrors that the briefs have given you, this proliferation
of short-'-terra leases, terminal-1© at will, under which producers
can limit their service obligation in soma manner? and thereby
switch buck and forth between interstate and intrastate markets..
Th© suggestion is rw&lly so devoid of economic
reality -vis te b® a makeweight.
In respons© to earlier questions, I pointed out that
producer?- quit entering into these leases many, many years ago,
for economic reasons, and they are not going to do it again,
because 'they’re spending hundrctd of thousands and million? of
dollars on these wells new# and they're not going to subject

55
th@ms©lv®s to a situation where their right to producing gas

asm be cut off in five years or, even worse, cut off at the
will of the lessor.
But. even if the future producers should try to do
that, and should approach th® Commission with an application
to ra&k© such a sal® ©f gas, if the Commission determines that
that quantity of gas, feat limited qu&nity in some way
jeopardises the public interest, wa submit that it. has# and
can and will protect the public interest, just as it has don®
by refusing to issue certificates limited to the term of a
producer’s contract.

Th® Commission can refuse to issue th®

certificate, or it can condition it on the producer obtaining
a longa:; and more stable supply of gas.
On the other side of the coin# if this Court's going
to hold against Southland# it5s going to have to adopt#

in

affect, a new rule of law# in our opinion# and that is that
on® who never owned or had any interest in or control over gas
can dedicate that gas to interstate service,

as wts previously

discussrul, th© authority for such a holding will have to b®
found it. the Natural Gas Act, and we don’t believe there'sanything.' whatsoever in th© Natural Gas Act to indicato that
Congresr# in any way# intended such a radical alteration of
©steblirhed ownership rights.
«

In conclusion, I'd like -fee briefly summarize th®
two points that w© think &r© controlling in this case.

56
First, a producar cannot dedicate gas which he has
neviar ovned.

This is ferus under property law and, as I have

discussed, is true under the Natural Gas Act»
Second, Gulf never owned or had any interest in or
control over Southland*s gas, and therefore could not
dedicate such gas»
Froia •Mies© two simple but indisputable points, w@
believe it is clear that Southland's gas is not now and never
has been dedicated to interstate commerce*
Consequently, Southland is under no obligation to
obtain abandonment authorization under Section 7(b) of the
Natural las Act before Southland can sell its gas to the
purchaser of its choice.
For these reasons, we respectfully urg® that this
Court affirm the» decision below, on the ground that; under
the Natural Gas Act Gulf could not and. did not dedicate
Southland's gas to interstate service.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Vary well, Mr. Attwell,

Mr. Attorney General,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. HILL, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. HILL*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts

I'm grateful for the tan minutes that's been allotted

57
to ma to express some concern which we have for the broader
legal implications that w@ think ars inherent in this FPC
order, which petitioners are seeking to uphold.
And, if I might address first what 1 conceive this
order to do, s© that I can demonstrate why our concerns are
real, both as to the effect; of this order on the stability of
our domestic drilling program which affects this entire nation,
it*a effect on our State lands, which we own, and, of ©ours®,
its effect ©a our consumers whose own gas supply is in
jeopardy in many instances by this order.
Let me try to say why I believe this order conjures
up th© pnt.@ntiatd.Iity ©f many, many adverse effects on
established legal rights, what we thought ware established
legal rights prior to this FPC order.
Th® order states on its face, and I’m quoting from
443 of the Appendix:

"Thus it makes no difference whether a

leas© in transferred or terminates, the obligation of service
imposed upon the dedicated gas continues. ...the duty to
continue to serve is like an ancient covenant running with th©
land."
So, in this order, th© FPC has held that as a matter
of law, Gulf here created & federal covenant running with th©
lend f©rover, by making an interstate sale of Gulf's 50~y©ar
gas commitment under this lean®. And so th© order holds that
although th© landowner was not a party to the granting of that

58
certificate, although it's suggested by Justice Rehnquist the
landowner could have been brought in ®s a condition to the
granting of that certificate# condition to Gulf# that wasn’t
dona. And although th@ landowner clearly is not a natural gas
company within the meaning of 7(b)# and although Southland
here is clearly not the owner of any facilities being used in
service within the meaning of 7(b). and although the landowner
here is clearly the owner of different gas# gas that was never
subjected or never could have bean subjected to the jurisdic­
tion of the Commission# to us© the words of the Act, you can’t
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by an application
gas you don’t own# whether yon say in that application#
Justice Marshall, that I’m just applying for a 50-year supply
or whether you just attached your lease.

You simply don't

have the power to commit in that application any gas beyond
that which you own.
And in spit© of all that —
QUESTION?

Well# tho Gas Act: could so provide, I

suppose , couldn’t it:?
MR. HILL:

>
Well# that’s possibly so, and whether or

not that would be a proper ~~
QUESTION:

Well, the Commission says it so provides

right now.
MR. HILL:

Well, I don’t agree with that# and I

think if: would also pretend some other constitutional questions

59
that; ara not before us»
But, suffice it to say that it is not —
QUESTIONS Weil, no raora so than what; the Commission
says»

Th© Commission says that when you dedicate under a,

leas®, you've dedicated all the gas „
MR» HILLS
QUESTION:

Well, that's why —
That's the way they construe th© Act»

So if there ere constitutional issues, if th© Act, expressly
said it# there axe constitutional issues now*
MR* HILL:
issues*

Well, I'm not addressing constitutional

I was responding to you, to say that I think an-

effort to do that# whether by th© Commission or by the Congress #
would certainly open up such questions»
But it's enough to nay hare that the gas from the
acreage *— they're holding that th® gas from this acreage must
be forever ©old into the inters tats market.

That's the nubbin

of our complaint# that even though it's & 50~y@ar supply and
a SO-yenr 1mm®, -that.by this so-called covenant running with
th© land theory of th® FPC in their order# that swan after that
l®a:i© expires# that th© gas hi,is to still be sold into inter­
state commerce*
New, that legal result of that order bothers Texas#
because if gas is discovered in th® future in our State, and
we think a great, deal will b© discovered in the future — 2
hope for the good of this country that it will be — if that

60
gas. is discovered from a leas© that’s previously bsen under an
expired lease, and I assure this Court;, and we’ve set it: out
in our brief by dh@cki.ng with our Land Office, that w® know
in tdi® instance of State-owned land, that thar® are many
unexpirol leases, seta® as many &a sight and nine unexpired
l®as@s, ;md I mean ©xpirad for legitimate purposes.

If under

any q£ those expired leases, it could be discovered later, if
this FPC order hare holds up, that that — that there was
some interstate gas sold back up the road, even though it
petared out and is no longer in tha game, that that would
create n covenant running with that lend so as to commit
any new gas produced from than acreage into interstate commerce
forever.
It takas little imagination to see what effect that
has on 4ii® stability of title searches, the stability of
drilling programs, to know wh«ra you stand when you go in to
male© thos deep tests, which ve'ra increasingly having to make,
to find gas in this country»
And, as Justice White observed, this order her© is
broad enough to cover a situation where A obtained 'the
cartifice.ta from the PPG and then gets in litigation with B,
who claims that he really owns- tha lease, even though A in
good faith thought he owned it, and B wins.

B, in spite of

the fact; h® had ms thing to do with th© certification process,
wasn’t involved, topsids or-bottom, could be held under this

SI
"ancient covenant running with the landw ‘theory in this order

to ba subject to the PPC jurisdiction to interstate commerce
sales and to abandonment procedures for actions that he
totally was — were unauthorised for him and in which he had
no participation and presumably no knewledge.
How then, when a producar in Texas is leasing today
for new exploratory purposes, under this order and the breadth
of this order that producer would have no assurance at all that
there hasn't been a previous Isas© applicable to that acreage
that would automatically subject his acreage to the PPG
jurisdiction in the interstate market.

QUESTION:

And of course

Do you think th© lessor and the lessee

prior tsc.3 the fifty years could just together terminato tea
lease, agree to terminate it?

MR. HILL:

No, but you can —-

QUESTION'S And without getting th® Commission's
consent?

MR. HILL:

What wa have today under our — so long

as gas it produced, end that's. the way most of our leases
r©ad, when there's no gas produced and it’s past the primary
term, the leas© lapsos.

That's the typical thing teat happens

in th© oil industry today.
And teat happened six times, seven times, eight times.
Sometimes they go through an rbandonment procedure and sometimes
they don't.

Possibly, if you

62
QUESTION: Wall, suppos® til® gas had run out in th©
forty ya-rrs, technically, I suppose, the Commission could
require an abandonment; proceeding —
MR® HILL:

No doubt about it.

QUESTION:

Yes®

And why wouldn't it satisfy your

concerns; Mr® Attorney General, if a lassae, at th® end of
his lease, had to file his petition for an abandonment, but
if idle facts are as he alleged, the Commission would have to
grant it — would have to grant it®
MR® HILL:

Well, in the first place, Mr® Justice

White, the theory of th© covenant running with the land —
QUESTIONs

I don't —t* I*m not talking about that.

MR® HILL:

I know you're not, but —*

QUESTION*

Would it satisfy your concerns if th©

rule; w*>s that h® had to file but that th® Commission would
have to grant th© abandonment*
MR® HILL:

That would not, because that doesn't change

this order that says that we'ra establishing a covenant
running with the land.
QUESTION:

But I thought Mr® Justice White's

question was not necessarily supporting th® reasoning of the
Commission, but simply indapendant of the reasoning of th©
Commission.
MR. HILL*

Wall, I would answer it then, that if that

supplants the language and we don't have & convenient running

S3
with the Imdj arid the abandonment proceeding would have the
legal effect of eliminating entirely th® notion that the new
less©© wouldn't have a free hand to come in and produce, if h®
«

found gim, and sell it wherever he wanted to? that would
eliminato our concern.
But there ar© two problems to it.
First? this Court has got to deal with this covenant
running with the land»

I hope you will in your decision.

QUESTION s But your colleague — Mr. Barnstt said that
ia that example that, you reviewed, the on© I gave, he thought
the Commission would have to grant th© abandonment under th©
Commission*s rule.
MR. HILL:

In th© A end B case.
No, th® csss you ash®d him about, th©

litigation —
QUESTION: And tiis on© you just reviewed.
He thought the Commission would have to • grant the
abandonment, although they would —
MR. HILL:

Well, it’s by no means certain that they

would. Lad ha inferred, from his answer to you, that the
theory of this decision was that the FPC was finding as a
matter of law that they had implicit rights, that Southland
had implicitly authorised th® dedication of their gas.
And so there would •**QUESTION: Well, I understand.

I understand that

th© Commission isn't agreeing with my suggestion — wouldn’t

64

be agreeing with ray suggestion, but l*u wondering if it would
satisfy your concern?
MR. HILL:

No, sir, it would not.

QUESTION:

If the lessee had to file for abandonment

at the end of his Isas© term# end that; the Commission had to
grant it if -- unless thero were some hanky-panky or some
strange circumstances.
MR. HILL:

Well, in the first placa, it doesn't,

satisfy us because there are n number of our — a lot of

our acreage in Texas today, wiser© we have reason to believe
there wars seme prior interstat sals, but it peter.sd out,
there’s no more production and no abandonment was sought.
Now, what do we do about that kisid of a situation?
Are we to gc back now?
some rule about abandonment?

Is this Co-art going to writs

Or will — I think what tit©

Court should do, may it please the Court, is to hold now in
this cases, squarely and clearly, that a producer's interstate
service obligation cannot be broader cr longer than his
property right to sail gas.
QUESTION: Did you interpret Mr. Justice White's
question to moan that until th« less®® had filed an abandonment
and it had been pro forma approved by the Commission, the
lessor's sales of gas would be. subject to regulation by the
FPC?
MR. HILL:

I understood him to ask ma would it

65

satisfy our coneam about th© problams associated with newly
discovered gas if there was some requirement that the lessee,
ones •she5 leas© has fc®@n extinguished by production, was required
as a matter of absolute requirement tc> g© and obtain an abandon™
raant undssr 7(b) „
QUESTION i

And the Commission was required to grant

th® abandonment»
MR® HILL:

Yes, that would eliminate —» in other

words, tee abandonment —
QUESTION:

Because one© they had consented to the

abandonment, future gas is free, I taka it»
MR® HILL:

With on© provision»

If you will writs

out this — of any attempt of th© FPC to write into our law
this ancient covenant running with the land theory, because
that is? a broader concept than abandonment»
QUESTION: That would be wholly inconsistent with
ray suggestion»
MR» HILL:

Y©s, sir,,

So if we don't have an ancient covenant running
with the land coming out of this case, and if th© Court holds
that no producer can obligate gas that he doesn’t own, and
that abiuidonraent procedures would be mandatory, then w© would
hav© eora&thiaig that w© could work with»
But there are so many potentialities of harm when
you’»facwd here with an order like this, stating that:

we’re
