MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. DiMento.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANClo J. EiMENTO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. L1MENTO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is here on the grant of a petition for a writ
of cert to the First Circuit which partially vacated a judg­
ment of acquittal entered in the District Court for the
District of Massachusetts.

The case presents a double

jeopardy issue which arises in this way:

In November cf

1971, there were a series of raids, so-called, around the
suburban communities of Boston, pursuant to search warrants
directed to suspected bookmaking establishments.

The warrants

were issued as the result of a series of wiretaps authorized
by the District Court which had been conducted since the
previous June.
reason

For some reason

and I don't know the

it was not until ten months later, in September 1972,

that an indictment was returned and in this particular, indict­
ment, the one now before you, sixteen persons were indicted
and eventually eleven were tried, of whom one was- the
Petitioner sanabria.

It was a•one-count indictment, charging

a violation of Title IS United States Code, section 1955*

which* as you know, is the so-called "Bookie Syndicate' Act,
About a month after the indictment was returned, the
Fourth Circuit announced its decision in Jordano which you
might recall was the case that held that a wiretap was invalid
if application for it had been authorized by a person other
than the Attorney General or the specially designated assis­
tant, as reo.uired by the statute.

Then this Court granted

cert in Jordano and in the spring of 1973, by agreement among
all the parties, including the Government and tne defendants,
the case was allowed to lie domant pending your decision in
Jordano.

And X give you this history because there is some

suggestion in the Government's brief and in the record that
for chree or four or five years defense counsel was plotting
ways to attack the indictment.
The case was essentially dormant for a good part
of the time and eventually in m id -197 ^ , X believe, this Court
upheld Jordano and, as a result, many, many of the indictments
that had resulted from the raids were dismissed and this was
one of the few surviving; indictments, if not the only one.
It became immediately apparent to defense counsel that unless
we could find some other basis for a :Fourth."Amendment attack
there was simply no defense for these defendants.

There was

just a ton of evidence if all the bookmaking slips and wire­
taps were going to get into evidence.
We thought we did come up with some other Fourth

Amendment grounds but the District Court didn't see it our
way* nor did the Court of Appeals.

Interestingly enough*we

filed a petition for cert here which was held by you over the
summer and denied this past September under the name of
Piotkin, Petitioner, I believe, versus United States.

eleventh and he was acquitted.

These

Sanabria was the

X am jumping ahead In time.

After the trial court denied our motion to suppress the
evidence, we realized that the trial was going to be simply
an exercise in the protection of the defendant's rights and
shortly before the trial began we began casting around for
some kind of defense to put on some kind of a plausible
defense at the trial.
And, of course, the place to begin is with the
statute.

The statute, if you will recall, prohibits will­

fully conducting a gambling business that has to meet three
criteria.

First of all, the gambling business must consti­

tute a violation of state law; second, it must Involve five
or more persons; and thirdly, it must be large.

It must be

in operation more than 30 days or receive a gross revenue of
more than $2,000 in any single day.

So that an essential

element of the offenssowas to prove that the
gambling law alleged, in the indictment violated
state law.

The indictment particularized as the violation

of state law Section 17 of Chapter 271, and that section of

D

the Massachusetts General Laws is directed to games, like
horse races, political elections, boxing matches, but not to
lotteries, the numbers game, so-called.

And thus, the

Government had to prove, or we thought the Government had to
prove, that the defendant was in the business -- or the
business that was being alleged was one that was in violation
of Lection 17* and that is a non-numbers type of game.
Sc at the close of the Government's case, when it
put Section 17 into evidence, by way of asking the court to
take judicial notice of it, we made what I might charitably
call a somewhat specious argument.

Because the indictment

described the business as one of registering bets, which is
not, technically speaking,a crime under Massachusetts law.
The crime is being found in a place with apparatus for
registering bets.

But because the indictment described the

business as one for registering bets and because it described
the gambling business as including a numbers operation, and
the numbers operation was not a crime under Section 17 which
was specified in the indictment, we moved for a judgment of
acquittal.

And as I say, the motion was completely unsound.

We took a wild shot,
it.

but the District Court was not buying

And at the Appendix, page 7, you will find the District

Court holding that the indictment was not effective and
denying the judgment of acquittal on that basis,
QUBoTXCN:

Am I correct that so far you. admit that

you started out in this case to create a condition where you
would have what you consider a foolproof double jeopardy
point?
MR, JiMDNTO:

Oh, no,

I never dreamed that this

case would get this far or that there would be any double
jeopardy,
QUbc-TION:

You said you made this specious argument,

and all that, on the stand,
MR, JlMDNTOg

Well, I made a specious argument

moving for judgment of acquittal, when the proper motion should
have been a motion to dismiss the indictment.
argument was not well founded.

That was why the

Then, after the District Court

denied the motion, and properly so, we got down to the serious
business of directing ourselves to the evidence in the case,
and we moved -- at page 11, I believe, of the record -- to
strike for limit the numbers evidence so as not to be con­
sidered on the first essential element of the crime, that is
that the gambling business must violate state law, in this
case violate Section 17, the horse racing statute.
So, what we were asking the court to do was either
strike out all the numbers because horse racing had been
particularized or limit the numbers evidence, so that it
could be received only as further description of the gambling
and perhaps go into the state of mind of the defendants,
that is that they were professional gamblers and knew what

s
they were doing.
QUESTION:

Your point was that since the indictment

hadn't recited in detail each of the Massachusetts statutes
that was thought to be violated and a necessary prerequisite
for the federal offense, this motion was in order.
MR. PIMENTO:

Mot quite, Your Honor.

My point was

that there was one statute which was particularized and that
was the statute the violation of which the Government had to
prove,
QUESTION:

When you say particularized, do you

mean alleged?
MR, PIMENTO:

Alleged in the indictment, particularly

alleged in the indictment.
QUESTION:

And it was your view that the indictment

to be sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss had to
allege chapter and verse of the Massachusetts lav/.
MR. PIMENTO: No, not that either.
the trial judge, recognized that.

And Judge dkinner,

If it had simply alleged

that the gambling business violated state law, that would have
been enough.

And I think Judge Skinner said that, that what

the Government had done was narrowed it, specified

action 17

and was stuck with It in the view of Judge Skinner.
QUESTION:

In other words, it was kind of a mis­

leading contention on your part that since they didn't have to
specify anything, but they did specify one section and,

9
therefore, you had more or less been misled so that you were
prepared to defend only as to that aspect.
MR, DlMENTO:

Well, I really didn’t think I had to

show that I was misled or prejudiced because it is part of the
due process that you prove what is charged and you charge what
you intend to prove.

I suppose that is part of it, but it

all goes to the fundamental right to be notified of the crime
with which you are charged.
At any rate, the District Court denied our motion
to strike the evidence or limit it and then the defendants
put on some evidence and then we renewed, what I would call
our specious judgment of acquittal motion and that was denied*
And then there was a recess and the judge came back from the
recess and said that he had done some research, he had re­
considered our motion to strike or in the alternative to
limit the evidence and he decided to strike the evidence,
the numbers evidence.
quoting:

And he says at page 13, and I am

"section 17 does -not include the numbers aspect,

so that while I am not going to grant a motion for judgment
of acquittal on that basis, I will grant the motion to strike
so much of the evidence in the case as has to do with numbers
betting. "
Then, when the dust had cleared and the numbers
evidence had all been taken out of the case, it became
obvious that there was no evidence linking one defendant to

10

the case in any way, linking him to the gambling business.
And that defendant was the Petitioner here, Sanabria.

So I

did what I assumed was the logical thing to do, moved for
judgment of acquittal0

Of course, what we could have done was

to do nothing at all and permit the jury to return a verdict
of not guilty, which it would have had to do, because the judge
would have had to instruct that they could convict' somebody
only if he were connected to a horse racing gamoling business,
and the jury under those instructions would havs done the right
thing, I assume.,
QUESTION:

When you moved; you., in effect, waived your

right to have the jury return that verdict, you chose to have
it determined in a different manner„
MR„ .OiMENTO:

j don't think so, Your Ion or.

I thought

that question had been passed in the Martin Linen case decided
only last April, where this Court recognizes that a judgment of
acquittal is the equivalent of a directed verdict, and 1 would
assume of a verdict.
QUESTION:

But insofar as the Jlouble Jeopardy Clause

protections, one of them is the right to go tc she jury that
is impaneled and have your determination come from that first
jury.,

3- on 11 you think when you make a motion like you do,you

waive that right in favor of some preferred method of determina­
tion?
MRo BiMENTQ:

I don't think of it as a waiver.

I

11

think of it as saving the court, the Government, defense counsel
and all the personnel involved in the trial a lot of time.
Why go through the empty and futile gesture and go through this
empty ritual of sending the case to the jury when you know there
is only one conclusion they can arrive at, and that is —
QUESTION:
at it.

But you are not willing to let them arrive

You want to short circuit it.
MR. BiMENTO:

Oh, I would have been willing.

I would

have been willing.
QUESTION:

But you weren't, because you made the

motion.
MR. PIMENTO:
rules.

Well, because I was following the

I am sure the. judge would have, if I had by way of a

request for instruction asked the judge, the trial judge, to
instruct the jury that they are not to convict anybody who is
not in the horse business.

He would have, when I made that

request for instructions, said to me, "Damn fool, why aren't
you moving for a judgment of acquittal.

I am not going to send

this case and sit around until the jury decides up there in the
jury room that there is no evidence."

He would have, I suppose,

sui sponte, entered the judgment of acquittal.
So, I don't think of myself as waiving anything.

So,

the judgement of acquittal was allowed end then the Government
filed its notice of appeal.

And I would say the notice of

appeal of the First Circuit is the first time and only time the

12

Government correctly described what happened,, because it says
,!the United States appeals from a decision and order of the
district Court excluding evidence and entering a judgment of
acquittal and denying a motion for reconsideration.1'
had been a motion for reconsideration thereafter.

There

Ancle then

in the second paragraph of its notice of appeal, the Government
says*,

"it is hereby certified that the evidence suppressed

constitutes substantial proof of the charges against the
defendant,"
Obviously# the Government was trying to fit this into
that part of the statute which permits it to appeal from an
allowance of a motion to suppress evidence.

So, the net result#

really#as to what happened here was that there was an erroneous
ruling on the evidence *»- and it pains me to say that the ruling
was erroneous.

I thought it was right and 1 still do,

that's not before you.
erroneous.

But

The First Circuit has decided it was

but a correct ruling on the state of the evidence

in granting the motion for judgment of acquittal.

J. .

This characterization the Court of Appeals in the
First Circuit holds is inaccurate.

That court holds that the

critical ruling by the District Court was that the indictment
failed to charge a violation of Section 1955 cn a numbers
theory# and that's at Footnote 5 of the Court's opinion# at
page 6 of our Appendix to the petition.
But# may it please the Court# that can be said of

13
almost any erroneous ruling, excluding evidence as irrelevant.
When a court decides whether evidence is to be admitted or not*
it must necessarily interpret the scope of the indictment,and
if it interprets the scope widely it will permit in more
evidence.

If it narrows the scope* it will narrow the amount

of evidence that comes in.

But when it excludes evidence on

the basis of irrelevancy* that exclusion is no more appealable
than if it erroneously excluded evidence because it was in­
competent.

And here* the Court of Appeals says not that the

indictment was dismissed but that it- was effectively dis­
missed.

And not that evidence was excluded but that the charge

was excluded.

It speaks of excluding the charge.

And the

Court of Appeals says* and this is adopted by the Government,
that the numbers charge was a discreet basis for imposing
criminal liability.

And this discreet basis was effectively

dismissed.
Now* we have here what I respectfully consider to
be a new vocabulary introduced into the criminal law.
Indictments are divided into counts* as we all know* but now*
under the law of the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit*
counts are to be further divided into discreet bases of
liability which I call* in my notes* DBLs* discreet bases
of liability.
QUESTION:

Xm plied c ou n t s.

MR. DiMENTO:

Yes.

14

And if the law of the First Circuit is to become
the law of the land, then the erroneous failure of the trial
court to recognize a DBL and a resulting exclusion of evidence
will be the equivalent of a dismissal of that DBL, and any
judgment that results will be appealed as, of course, only to
that jBL,
QUESTION:

DBL means?

MR, DiMKNTG:

Blue rest basis of liability, my

shorthand expression for the Court of Appeals' --

And, the Court of Appeals, however, puts a limit on
this DBL theory, by saying that you can have a DBL that has
constitutional significance, double jeopardy significance,
only where the count is duplicitous, that is, the DBL must
be one of the offenses contained in the indictment*
Government takes a more extreme view*

The

Because the Government

concedes that the First Circuit was in error when it held
that this particular indictment was duplicitous, it now must
take the position, if it’s going to cling successfully to
this DBL theory, it must take the position that a DBL must
still be treated as a separate offense for purposes of double
jeopardy analysis, even though the count is not duplicitous,,
;io that, under the Government's definition, 'X think
it is possible to isolate several DBla in this indictment,
in this one count*

As a matter of fact, DBL recognition will

become a very important part of the skills of every defense

15
lawyer, because his failure to recognize a DBL could have
drastic double jeopardy consequences.

You might get into hundreds

And, it seems to me. that if you are going to

incorporate that into our law it should be prospective
because, the Lord knows, nobody really recognizes this theory
up ’til now and lawyers ought to have a time to learn what
these BBLs are and also the District Courts ought to be
instructed liberally to grant particulars -«»
QUESTION:

1 take it you, from your argument, you

agree that if there were to be BBLs recognized that what the
judge did here was to dismiss that LBL.

I don't think he did that, not at all.

QUESTION:

QUEoTXOM:

Well, what happens at that stage of a

IT
trial?

Suppose you don't have this DBL element in it at all.

There is simply an indictment for a bank robbery and at the
beginning of the Government's case the trial judge says, "I
am going to exclude all evidence of bank robbery,"

What's the

next step that either of the parties takes?
MR, LiMGNTQ;

Well, I think you've got the problem

of a dishonest judge, intellectually dishonest judge, at least,
QUf&TlON;

Let's face it.

We've got a whole bunch

of judges around the country and my hypothetical isn't —*
' He may think there is something wrong with the indictment, or
perhaps there is something wrong with the indictment.

At any

rate, he says, "I'm going to exclude any evidence of the crime
charged In the indictment."
MR, PIMENTO;

Well, Your Honor, what can .1 say?

The defendant didn't appoint the judge.

The Government bad

more to do with the appointment than we did.
QUESTION:

But what happens next?

Maybe it is a

poor ruling on the part of the judge, but what does defensecounsel do at this stage?
MR. DiKEHTD:

Oh, he's delighted.

What does the

Government do?
QUESTION:

The Government is simply sitting there

with no move to make,
MR. PBIEIITU;

What happens?

and then correctly a judgment -f acquittal is entered

QUESTION;

On the motion of the defendant?

MR» jiMLNTG:

On the motion of the defendant»

He might, you know, say, "I am going to let in all
bank robbery evidence, but the evidence you have is incompetent
It Is all hearsay and I am excluding it on that basis," and
he could be 100$ wrong, but that's the system»
QUESTION;

Then you have a Fong Foo case, don't you?

MR» L1MLNTQ;
QUESTION:

Yes, you get pretty close to that»

My brother Rehnquist*s example.

Let's

say he wholly, irrationally and clearly, conspicuously,
erroneously excludes evidence and the result is an acquittal,
then you have a Fong Foo case, that is an acquittal, and the
Government can't appeal.
MR, LIMENTO:

I would say that's about as close as

you can come, the Fong Fco case.
Also critical to the Court of Appeals' holding was
that there should have been an objectior to the indlcment
before trial.

But there was nothing wrong with the indictment.

Ten people were eventually convicted under the indictment and
Sanabria, himself, coulo have been convicted if the .Government
had in any v/ay been able to connect him with the gambling
business defined in tho indictment.

And the Government concede

in its brief that there was no support for a pretrial motion
to dismiss, if there h'd been one,
QUESTION:

Ar. LTMento, as I understand the law that

has subsequently developed, had the judge made a different
ruling on the exclusion of the evidence, your client could
have been convicted In this trial on the numbers evidence.
MRo DiMfNTO:
QUESTION;

Oh, yes.

So, he was in jeopardy of conviction on

both DBLs *
MR. DiMdNTO: Oh, yes, yes.

And, even with the

numbers evidence out, he was in Jeopardy of conviction under
the horse aspect, because there might have been some little
evidence left in there connecting him. with the horses.

So

he was in jeopardy on both.
But the Government says that although we had no
ground for a pretrial motion to dismiss, we should have
objected to the indictment beforehand.

Mow, I don't know of

any such objection under the rule as it existed then* but the
Government says we should have in some way pointed out the
miscitation of Section 37«
no miscitation.

Our position is that there was

Section 37 was a perfectly valid part of the

Massachusetts statute, and the indictment was a fine coherent
whole*

So that, I just don't see that there was any ground

for any type of motion before trial.

What the Government is

really saying is that we should have written a letter to them
and say, "Gentlemen, we think that what you really intend to
do here is to charge not only a violation of Section 37 but
also a violation of Section 7, and I think you had better

20

amend your indictment or go back and get a new one, because
while you will be able to convict ten of the clients here,
Uanabria, we are told, has no evidence of engaging in horse
betting, so therefore you had better go back and get a
different"—
QUESTION:

What happens in a case where there are

two counts in an Indictment and the Government offers evidence
under both of them and then the defendant says the indictment
really is defective, doesn't effectively charge a crime?
And the court says, "I think that's right.

I am going to

dismiss that count and, of course, I will then exclude the
I

evidence the Government has offered to support this crime
that hasn't been charged."

It Is sort of the chicken and the

Here, the court didn't think that this indicment charged

a numbers crime.

MR* DiMoNTQ:

And so, what do you do first?

exclude the evidence or do you dismiss the indictment?
MR. DiMUNTQ:

QUiijTlQN:

Isn't it sort of odd to say that the

judge entered an acquittal on a crime that he thought the
judgment, the Indictment didn't charge?
MR* DiMDNTQ:

Well, no.

Did the judge think that a numbers crime

was adequately charged in this indictment?
MR. DIMENTG;
QUESTION:

No, he did not.

Weil, how could the judge acquit a person

of a »» enter a judgment of acquittal on a crime that he
thought the indictment didn't even charge?
MR. biMi-'NTQ;
has got a wrong premise.

Your premise is wrong.

Your question

You are talking about a crime.

There was no numbers crime, as such.

The crime was violating

state law, and the judge thought that the violation of state
law in the manner, by means of numbers, did not satisfy the
indic tment *
QUESTION:

And that there was no — although the

indictment could have charged a crime that the evidence would
have supported,
MR, piMENTO:

Although the indictment could have

charged a crime — If it had been written differently, yes.

22

QUESTION:

Yes .

Well, the Court of Appeals thought that the
Indictment adequately charged a crime, that this —- to which
this evidence was relevant.
MR* BiMENTO:

Yes0 The Court of Appeals thought the

evidence was relevant, and that’s the issue *
QUESTION:

But left no one in doubt as to what

crime was being charged,,
MR, BiMSNTO.:
QUESTION:

Yes,

And I recall your earlier statement.

You conceded that it left you in no doubt.
MR, TIMENTO:

I knew what crime was being charged,

but I knew also that It had been narrowed and particularized
to a violation of horse betting.
And, finally, the Court of Appeals says and the
Government adopts the argument,that we gave up our valued
right to a verdict, which I think I have covered before.
We never, never thought that by moving to exclude evidence and
then moving for a judgment of acquittal, we were waiving any­
thing or giving up any right.

And I don’t see how anybody can

fairly say that our decision to move for the exclusion of the
evidence or to object to the evidence and then to move for a
judgment of acquittal could in any way constitute a waiver of
anything so valuable as the constitutional right not to be.
twice put in jeopardy for the same crime*

23
QUESTION:

Well, it is not a question of not

waiving a right to double jeopardy, it is a question of
consciously deciding not to go to this particular jury for
a verdict,
MR, D1MENT0:

Well, only because the rule puts.the

obligation on defense counsel not to waste the court's time
by sending the case to the jury under instructions that will
inevitably result In a verdict of not guilty,
QUESTION;

But you did make a choice,

MR, DiMSNTO:

Well, I don't think — I think I

fulfilled an obligation to the court not to waste its time,
I don't think 1 made a choice in the sense that I was sacri­

.AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:02 p.nu)
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sasterbrook, you may

resume.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. SASTERBROOK, ESQ.,
ON BEIiALF OF THE R£SPONDENT (Resumed)
MR0 EAST.SRBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Just before lunch X had read part of the charging
portion of the indictment which said that defendants,as part
of the operation of a gambling enterprise,accepted bets and
wagers on a paramutual number pool.
After the District Court denied the motion for a
judgment of acquittal on the grounds of insufficiency of the
evidence, the defendants then argued that the indictment
failed to state any offense involving numbers betting, although
it clearly did so on its face, because it referred to Section
17 of a particular Massachusetts statute.
,

This section, they

7

argued, referred mainly to horse betting, and that Section 7
referred to numbers betting.

After the District Court

initially denied this motion, it agreed and concluded that
the indictment did not adequately charge any offense Involving
the taking of numbers bets.

Having effectively struck through

the charge on the face of the indictment, charging numbers
bets, the District Court then excluded the numbers evidence as

28

irrelevant to what remained *
The trial was recessed over night and the prosecutor
asked the District Court to reconsider that decision*

District

Court asked counsel for Petitioner whether he was prejudiced,
and counsel said in open court that, indeed, there was no
prejudice because he had read the indictment and seen the
charge of accepting numbers bets*

He asserted, however, that

he didn't need to show prejudice, because this was a tech­
nical matter*
QUESTION:
show prejudice.

It is one thing to say you don't have to

It is another thing to say you haven't been

prejudiced *
MR* EASTERBROOK:

I think so*

I think the Court

of Appeals-was right in concluding that you didn't have to,
that you had to show prejudice, but in a minimum, having
conceded that there wasn't any, it wouldn't make any differ­
ence who had the burden to show prejudice or lack of if.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that that's a form of

waiver?
MR. EASTERBROCK:

No, I don't believe it's a formal

waiver of any sort.
QUESTION:

Not formal, a form, a kind of waiver*

MR, EASTERBROCK:
waiver.

We haven't relied on it as a

It is simply a statement that there was not, in fact,

any prejudice.

I would take it as a concession, as

29
Mr. L'iMento said in open court today, that he was making a
specious motion»
Nevertheless, the district Court adhered to its
ruling and concluded that the indictment would not be read
as stating any offense Involving number*©.

With the numbers

theory removed, the district Court then turned to the evidence
with respect to horse betting.

It found that this evidence was

insufficient to show that Mr, Sanabria was involved in the
gambling enterprise and it acquitted him on what remained.
v

The Court of Appeals held that this was the
equivalent to dismissing the indictment, insofar as it charged
engagement in accepting numbers bets, and it further held
that the £istriet Court's disposition of the numbers betting
portion of the indictment was not an acquittal because it had
nothing to do with relating the evidence to the elements of
the offense or to defining the elements of the defense, but
was simply a conclusion that the indictment was insufficient
on its face.
The Court then remanded for a second trial with
respect to the gambling offense, to the extent the gambling
offense involved numbers.

To the extent- it involved horse

betting, there was indeed an acquittal,

The Court of Appeals

held, and we agree, that we could not retry Petitioner on that
charge.
Petitioner has argued that the Criminal Appeals Act

30

does not authorize the appeal that the United States took.
This Court has held, however, that the Criminal Appeals Act
authorizes any appeal from a final judgment, unless the
Double Jeopardy Clause bars the way*
We believe, therefore, that the only question this
Court need confront is a constitutional one, and I turn
directly to that.

We believe that a second trial cn the

horse betting theory Is permissible for two reasons,
QUESTION:

On the what?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

On the numbers theory, I am sorry.

First, a defendant who has an opportunity before trial
to seek a resolution of defects apparent on the face of the
indictment, must do so then,
QUESTION:
the indictment?

Why was there a defect on the face of

The indictment was perfectly valid, facially.

It charged him with violation of the fee era1 statute and
the state criminal law it mentioned i'ias the one that covers
horse race betting.

And that was not a defective indictment

in any sense of the word, was it?
MR, EASTERBROQK:
QUESTION:

I think there are two answers --

There might or might not have been

sufficient evidence to convict him and the court held that
there was insufficient relevant evidence to convict him at
that — You don't make a motion before trial on that basis.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

No, Your Honor, but I meant that

31
contention In another way»

The indictment on its face charged

the taking of numbers bets* and then it referred to a state
statute.

Petitioner argued that the indictment would have

been adequate to charge the taking of numbers bets* if it had
either recited Section 7' of the Massachusetts statute or not
mentioned any Massachusetts statute »«
QUESTION: And just said it violates state law»
MR* EA5TERBRG0K•

Just said in violation of

state law „
QUESTION:

Because that is a component of the

fed era1 offense.
MR» EABTERBRQOK:

Yes* but the elements of the

offense had.to do with the statement that it violates state
j ■

law,

.and in order to be a sufficient charge the statement

that numbers bets were involved.
*

To the extent that numbers bets were not adequately
charged then, the claim is that something went wrong on the
face of that indictment, that although the language of the
indictment said that numbers bets were being taken and that
this was a gambling offense, the statement that Section 17 of
the Massachusetts statute was involved was enough to affect
the validity.of that charge apparent on the face of the in­
dictment»

It would have been open to Petitioner then to move

before trial to strike through that language, as incorrect
or inconsistent or in some other way inadequate.

32

Our argument is that since he didn't do so he then
opened up the possibility of a second trial that would
otherwise not have needed to be held.

I“11 get to that in

a moment.
The second argument* which is an alternative argument,
is that the .District Court's decision here removed the numbers
charge from the case at Petitioner's request, and that when
the District judge granted a judgment of acquittal all that
was left was horse betting.

The case, therefore, is not

significantly different from last term's decision in Dee
which held that a defendant could be retried after an
indictment had been dismissed in mid-trial at the defendant's
request.
The first argument has to do with the timing of
Petitioner's motion.

Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure requires that objections to defects on the
face of the indictment be raised before trial.

The argument

that the indictment which concededly recited that Petitionerengage in a betting offense Involving numbers did not actually
charge that offense is an attack on the sufficiency of the
indictment, and it therefore was required to be raised before
trial.
We have collected at Note 23 of our brief some
authorities that support this proposition.

Petitioner,

therefore, was not entitled to have his contention resolved

33
during trial at all»

Not having attacked the indictment

before trial, the judge was required to treat the charge as
sufficient,
The court did consider it.

In considering it at

all, it erred in Petitioner's favor.

But the timing of the

motion was Petitioner's choice and the judge did reach it,
and it gave him the relief he requested.

In doing so, it

erred a second time, as the Court of Appeals now has held.
In other words, this case is here because of a result of two
errors the District Court made, each induced by Petitioners
QUESTION:

Well, the Fong Foo case was here as a

result of egregious errors'that the trial court had made,
ending in a judgment of acquittal,

And we held that, regardless

of those extremely serious, almost irrational•errors, after an
acquittal there could not be an appeal by the Government
because of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
MR, EASTDRBROOK:

I think there are at least three

distinctions between Fong Foo and this case, one of which
the technical question of whether this was, indeed, an
acquittal, I'll get to in a second part of this argument.
The more Important distinction between this case and Fong Foo,
one that is pertinent to the argument I am making now, is that
in Pong Foo the things that led to the termination of the
prosecution could not have been raised before trial.

The

question whether a prosecution's witness was lying, whether the

evidence was believable, whether it was sufficient, and the
other- things that underlay the District Court's decision in
Fong Foo were capable of resolution only at a trial of the
general issue*
QUESTION:

And" the third.

You said there were

three*
MR. EAST.SRBRQOK;
QUESTION:

The third issue is —

The third difference.

MR, EASTERBRQCK:

The third difference— I am sorry

— is that the defendants in Fong; Fop did not ask the District
Court to do what he did,

They did not, in other words, request

the termination of the trial before the jury had a chance to
rule on the sufficiency of the evidence.

That’s one reason why

Pong Foo is quite different from cases like Lee and, indeed,
from cases like Dinlfcz in which the defendant, on his own
motion, took the case away from the jury and asked for a
pre-verdict termination.
QUESTION:

In Pinltz, the defendant asked for a

mistrial.
MRo EAST.ERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's quite different from asking and

getting a judgment of acquittal,
MR, EASTERBROOK:

I agree.

In Lee the defendant

moved for an order dismissing the indictment, and the court
held that that was the equivalent of a mistrial.

35
1 think it is also the case that if what the
defendant asks for and gets is really a dismissal of the
Indictment, that the same analysis applies, regardless of
what the District Court calls it„
QUESTION:

You are going to get to Martin Linen,

I expect „
MR. EASTERBROCK:
QUESTION:

I will,

Mr» Easterbrook, on that last point,

supposing as you suggest and was suggested this morning,
the defendant had not ruled for judgment of acquittal, but
had asked for instructions which would have really, in
fairness, mandated acquittal by the jury, and the jury
nevertheless found hira guilty.

Then, I suppose, under the

theory of the case that the trial judge actually adopted,
the trial judge would have been obligated to grant a motion
for a judgment, notwithstanding — or acquittal, notwithstanding
the verdict.
Had that scenario taken place, would you contend
that such an order by the trial judge would also have been
a dismissal?
MR» EASTERBROOK:

Well, it wouldn't have been —

Let me answer that in two ways.
First, your hypothetical case, as a case that this
Court has already decided, the case of Borman v. United States,
In 361 U.S„ <phe Court held that a second trial was permissible

36
in that case, because the jury did return a verdict of guilty
in the teeth of the evidence, as the judge defined it,
because the judge wrongly removed from the jury's consideration
the correct theory on which it could and should have convicted.
The second answer is that if that kind of thing had
happened in this case and the jury had in fact acquitted
instead of convicting, that it would not have been an
acquittal on the charge to the extent it involved numbers
evidence.
Our view is that the numbers charge was removed
from the case well before the judge granted an acquittal„
When the judge effectively said that there was no numbers
charge at all, because the indictment was inadequate to state
it, that took the case out.
charge.

What was left was a horse betting

Whether the District judge acquitted it, acquitted

by himself or sent it to the jury and the jury returned a
verdict of acquittal, is an arguable matter of detail.,
QUESTION:

You would say even if there were a jury

verdict of acquittal that because of the erroneous exclusion
of the evidence, that it should be treated as though the
indictment had been dismissed on this DEL,
MR, BASTDRBROCK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

I see,

MR. JEASTERBRQCK:

We would dispute, I think, whether

you would characterize this as an erroneous exclusion of

37
evidence»

It is clear that evidence was taken out of the

case, but it is also, I think, clear that more than that was
involved, that before the evidence went out there was a ruling
that the indictment was insufficient to state that part of the
offense*
QUESTION;
what it alleged*

We were talking about the indictment and

I don't find the indictment in the Appendix

or anywhere else*
MR* EASTERBROOK:

It's on page 16A of the Petition

for Certiorari*
QUESTION:

Thank you*

MR* EASTERBROOK:

Suppose the case had been

identical to the facts in Lee, in which the defendant was
charged with taking the wallet of a blind operator of a
candy stand in a post office*

The Judge had concluded, after

hearing all of the evidence, that the indictment was insuf­
ficient to state an offense because it didn't charge that the
defendant intended permanently to deprive Mr* Bilsky of his
property*

Having said that, the judge then formally excluded

the evidence.

In our view, it wouldn't make any difference

what the judge said or did, having concluded that the indict­
ment was insufficient on its face to charge that offense*
It was simply a matter of detail*

The defendant's interests

were fixed by the reason that the judge terminated the case,
and not the means by which he did so*

That, I think, is the

38
rationale underlying the distinction between dismissals of
the indictment and mistrials* on the one hand* and true
acquittals., on the other*

It has to do with the reason why

the case terminated* and not the form that the judge used
to make that termination come about*
And the reason this case terminated with respect to
the numbers offense was simply that the defendant succeeded
in persuading the court that the indictment was bad on its
face*
The purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to
avoid multiple trials at the request of the prosecution.
It guards against repeated prosecutions brought to embarrass
the defendant* to subject him to anxiety, to increase the
chance of conviction of an Innocent man, but the premise of
this rule is that it is possible to have guilt reliably
determined in a single trial.

When guilt can be determined

in a single trial* holding of two trials is pointless* and
an offense against the defendant's rights.

But when the

premise of this rule does not hold true* the court is
allowed second trials in order to produce a single fair
trial.

So* for example* there can be a second trial after

a tainted conviction has been reversed.

There can be another

trial after a mistrial has been granted because of manifest
necessity, or even in the absence of manifest necessity
because the defendant requested

J- G

a

And there can be another

39
trial, as in Lee, when an indictment has been dismissed at
the defendant's request because of a defect on its face*
In other words, when a first trial is flawed,
a second trial may be held»

When a defendant moves to

abort his case before verdict, a second trial may be held
even if the first one was not flawed»

In these cases, it

cannot be said that the prosecutor deprived the defendant of
his valued right to obtain the verdict df the jury at his
first trial»
QUESTION:

Mr, Easterbrook, let me be sure I have

your position on the Lee case»

You are taking the position

that if the case had gone to the jury and Lee had been
acquitted because of the judge *s view of striking evidence,
and so forth, that that acquittal could have been appealed
as though it were a dismissal»
MR» EASTERBROOK:

No, Your Honor, we are not taking

that position.
QUESTION:

I thought you said it was a matter of

detail whether
MR» EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Lee was a bench trial.

That’s right, it was a bench trial.

Had it been a jury trial and gone to the jury -MR. EASTERBROOK:

If it had actually gone to the

jury and the jury had returned the verdict of acquittal,in
our view, there could be no review, that would be the end of

40

things„
QUESTION:

But why not? Supposing the reason there

was an acquittal is because of an erroneous theory of the
indictment and an erroneous instruction to the jury which,
in effect, excluded, as in this case, the evidence relating
to the horse betting or numbers, whichever one it is.

What's

the differsiice?
MR» EASTERBRQOK:

One of the difficulties in re­

viewing judgments of acquittal has been that judgments of
acquittal could be based upon other reasons.

The judge may

make an erroneous instruction, but the jury might acquit
for reasons having nothing to do with the erroneous instrue»
tion, simply because «QUESTION:

Under the instruction, they could not

could not convict.

reason and you give the defendant the benefit of irrationality,
but not the benefit of the -- well, I see,
MR. EASTERBROCK:

Not ever, necessarily, irration­

ality, simply disbelief of the proof which might be rational
or irrational in a particular case.
QUESTION:

the extent it can be reduced to simply a claim of juryirrationality that the defendant is entitled to jury

QUESTION:

He would have instructed the jury that

was that was stricken* is not be be considered by you

But,

having that evidence out, if you still find him guilty of

horse betting, that the only theory on which you can find him
guilty is that you find evidence of horse betting, and I've
stricken all the evidence of horse betting.

And then they

say there is no such evidence and they acquit.
MR. EASTERBRQQK:

In our view the numbers issue

would still be alive because the numbers issue never went to
the jury at all, under your hypothetical.
QUESTION:

No, submits both issues to the jury.

I

am sorry, I'm not getting the example clear.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It's a confusing case.

If he submits both theories to the jury, then I
think the jury's acquittal is final, but if he takes out of
the case before it goes to the jury a discreet basis for the
imposition of liability, here the numbers offense, then the
jury —
QUESTION:

How did he take it out in this case,

other than by excluding the evidence?

That's all he did.

And then he said there is no evidence so "I'm going to enter
a judgment of acquittal."

same thing, you say it is a dismissal, if I understand you
correctly.

44
and because of a legs), theory that didn't have much to do
with sufficiency of the evidence, or indeed with the rele­
vancy of the evidence, but had to do with the adequacy of
the indictment.

I think that is the key in the case.

QUESTION:
then X will stop.

May I just ask one more question and
I apologize for taking so much time.

Would you agree that on the numbers charge, which
apparently that would now be regarded in the First Circuit as
sufficient indictment on the numbers charge as well as the
horse betting charge, that the defendant was actually put In
jeopardy on the numbers charge, assuming two separate theories
of liability when the first witness began to testify, or
maybe when the jury was sworn?
MR* EASTfRBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor, we agree that

he was, in fact, put in jeopardy.

The jeopardy was terminated

at his own request by the effective dismissal of the indictment
here as in lee.

In Lee, too, although the indictment was —*•

the information was defective, jeopardy attached at the
beginning of trial.
QUESTION:

On your theory, would there ever be a

case of no double jeopardy in the case of a count of an
indictment submitted to a jury by the judge, with respect to
which the jury returns a verdict of not gulltv?

There are no exceptions to that in our view,

MR, EASTDRBRQOK:

I am sorry* Your Honor* I did not

follow that hypothetical,
QUESTION:

Once the judge ruled on the evidence

and excluded the evidence* is there any way under the sun that

have to be reversed by the Court of Appeals,

judgment of acquittal.

It was the motion to take the numbers

count charging conducting a gambling enterprise by taking
horse bets, the other count charging the conduct of a
gambling enterprise by taking numbers bets.
The district judge would have done two discreet
things here.

He would have charged that the first count of

the indictment, charging the taking of numbers bets, was
insufficient on its face and dismissed it.

Then he would

have submitted a second count to the jury, a second count
dealing with the taking of numbers bets,

The jury would have

acquitted on that.

In our view, this is the same case as

that hypothetical.

It makes no difference to the defendant

so far as his double jeopardy Interests are concerned whether
there was one count or two.

And, although in our view once

the numbers, once the horse betting count went to the jury
fchafs a final,unreviewable disposition of the.numbers
argument. ' '
QUESTION:

Really, what you want us to say that

the prosecutor can draw any kind of indictment he wants.
MR, EASTHRBROOK:

The prosecutor has substantial

discretion in drafting an indictment and X —
QUESTION:

He doesn't have the discretion to draft

an illegal, unconstitutional • ->»
MR„ EASTERBROOK:

Oh, certainly net, Your Honor,

but I think it is agreed, at least between the parties here,
that a two-count indictment in this case would have been

proper
And* 1 think* insofar as the Double Jeopardy Clause
is concerned* it doesn't make any difference whether it is
In one count or two.
In Green v. United S fca fees * at 555 U.S., page 190*
Note 10* the Court took up exactly this kind of question.

The

question in Green was whether it made a difference in part
that first and second degree murder had been expressed in one
count rather than two.

And the Court said that the situation

is the same as though Green had been charged with these
different offenses in separate but alternative counts of the
indictment.

The constitutional issue at stake here should not

turn on the fact that both offenses were charged to the jury
under one count.
The same is true in this case.

The constitutional

issue should not turn on the fact that both theories of
liability were charged in one count.

The interests of the

defendant are the same either way* and the issue on which the
district judge eventually entered its judgment of acquittal
had only to do with the numbers betting theory of liability.
Excuse me. had only to do with horse betting and not numbers
betting.

If I make that mistake once more* it is going to be

exceedingly embarrassing,
I repeat that the problems here are largely of
Petitioner's making*

There was no fatal flaw in the indictment.

49
The first trial was not infected with error.

Petitioner took

a perfectly adequate trial* brought it to a halt* persuaded
the judge that he had not been adequately charged and aborted
the trial without obtaining the verdict of the jury,,
this was unnecessary.

All of

The timing was Petitioner’s choice.

The error was introduced at Petitioner’s urging,
'We* therefore* believe that because he urged ■
the District Court to err twice* once in timing and once in
taking the numbers offense out of the case* he should not now
be entitled to absolute immunity from prosecution.
We* therefore* believe that the Court of Appeals
correctly held the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar
Petitioner’s second trial,
QUESTION:
me if I’m wrong.

Didn't the Martin Linen case — correct

I might be* we've had so much double

jeopardy recently. — didn't the Martin Linen case, in effect*
hold that the grant of a motion for an acquittal was the
equivalent of a jury verdict of acquittal?
MRo 5ASTMRBRQ0K:

Yes* Your Honor* it did* and we

do not contest that holding here* although I argued the
Martin Linen case on the other side.
But the gist of my argument has been that two
things happened here.

One* with respect to the horse betting

theory of liability* ended in a true judgment of acquittal*
although entered by the judge. It should be treated as if it

50

were by the jury, and we ean;t retry Mr* Sanabria on horse
betting.
QUESTION:

It is difficult to conceive of how you

can have an acquittal of part of a count, but X know that5s
what this whole case involves.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

For the same reason, I think, that

you could have acquittal on Count One of a two-count indictment
if this charge had been broken up into two counts.
QUESTION:

But that depends on reading the indictment

in the way that you have suggested, does it not?
MR a EASTERBROOK:

It does.

And It depends on

characterizing what the district judge did in the way the
Court of Appeals characterized it.

But we think the reading

is correct and the characterization is fair,and the rest of
the argument is down hill from there.
QUESTION:
on appealability.

Mr. Easterbrook, just one other question
At the outset, you mentioned that, ae you

view the Criminal Appeals Act, an appeal lies wherever it —
a second trial would not be barred by the Double Jeopardy
Clause.

And you stated the Court had, in effect, so held.

Are you referring to what I characterized as dicta in the
Filson case?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I am.

1 think It was an alterna­

tive ground for the decision end it must be seen as a holding.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
