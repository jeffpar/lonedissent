MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Michigan against Tyler and Tompkins.
Mr. Butler, you may proceed whenever you are ready*,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY BUTLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BUTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it ple&s|2

the Court:
This arson case presents, the questions of when and
•to what axtent a warrant is to La required for post-fire and,
by analogy, other post-disaster investigations and of which
evidence is adire' ssible against in particular arsonists who
burn their own buildings.
The cR.se arises .out of facts which, for the most

part, are typical of any arson for profit case, with two . tall
exceptions which we plan to elaborate upon later in argument*
In relating this 'facts and in attempting to' justify
warrantless post-firs searches in general as -well as the
■’3:,'’chi :j which occurred in particular :L
four principal themes.

this case, we hara

The first, is that the public interest

in a post-disaster or post-fir® search is significantly
greater than the public interest in any inspection of the ryrv:
touched upon or dealt with in Camara, Sj®, and Secretary of
State against Barlow.
The second theme is that the privacy interests at

4
issu®, as well as the potential for abusa; are very minim.» I,
primarily because of the extensive damage that has taken
place, the extent of the already lawful intrusion, and
because of the natura of the search for the cause or origin
of the fire.
Third, we contend that a warrant in circumstances
like these, whether administrative or criminal, will provide
no protection in the g:

majority of cases, very little

protection in a very limited class of cases.
Fourth--our fourth theme is that a fire investiga­
tion—there are certain costs in fire investigation and in
public safety to require any kind of administrative search
warrant.
The general interests in conducting a search of
this type are several.

The cause itself must b© determined

first as Bf.au tr*pe of exigent circumstance.

This is a them©

Supreme Court seemed not to acknowledge,
t they did say if there are exigent circumstances, the possibility of danger, of evidence burning, of

have concluded that until the cause is determined, there
should he a presumption that there is an exigent zi rcumsteacc...
Q

In the local law applicable her© is- every fir

5
subject to some investigation as to cause?
MR* BUTLER:

There is a local statute which

requires the local fir© marshal to determine—to conduct a
physical investigation to determine the cause or origin of
the fire, and it states that he may enter without warrant any
premises for making that determination.
Q

The statute says—the stats statute—says that

the director or any officer is authorized to investigate and
inquire*

It does not direct him to investigate and inquire.
MR. BUTLER:

if not that specific statute, it is

clear that under the Fire Prevention Act, he does have the
cl,hey to determine the cause or origin of all fir-js that

or death.

And did you sav in answer to the question of

the Chisf Justice, that he does in fact investigate the causa
or origin of every sin
MR. BUTLER:

ge and small?
The statute reads where there is injury

or dsath or damage to property.

I mean, he would have to list

.y fire that is called to his attention, very small fires that
In would never hear of, of course.
Q

Because the statute is simply an authorizing
rry statute.

MR. BUTLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

But you say that in

in every ease where there ia a loss of Iff

There is always going to b

MR. BUTLER:

That is brought to his attention,

If

it is a very small fire that*—I mean, of course if it is not.
reported to any fire department, no, he does not do that.
Q

I am assuming it has been reported to the fir;.,
And chore is always damage to property In a fir®,

That is what X meant by that

torn:.
Q

Did the Michigan Court construe the state

statutes?
MT-. BUTLER:

hr believe that he construed 'the state

statute ho require a warrant only to make it constitutional
undor the Fourth Amendment.

But they did read a warrant,

recedrement is to that statute.

We claim that it makes vary

:lfchl« stnsc* to 3c? that because the—It is certainly not the
intent of the legislature because they surely should ba
prasumsd to know that any fir® investigator can enter ©

7

building with *, warrant.

So, by vary clear implication, tUo

statuta on its face would seam to allow warrantless searches..,
That is, th® Court said the statute did not speak to the
question.

?
Q

But are w© not bound by the Michigan construc­

tion, to the extant that that is? relevant to this caso?
MR. BUTLER;

I do not believe yon would be bound by

it if their construction depended upon ah erroneous view only
of .the Fourth JLusndmsnfc.

If it dependend upon any other vie,

of Michigan lav?, then the Court would be bound by it.
Q

Is not the only reason the case is here becaus a

they have construed th
MR. BUTLER:

Q

federal constitution?
Ta.r., it is, Your Honor.

Mr, But]or, do I correctly understand your

view is that, the exigent circurastances exception should
survive until the cause of ths ft ■
MR. butler;
Q

is determined'?

Precisely, Your Honor.

Even if that might take a. year, or two?

5?

if the building was roevrstrueted f would it still survive that
long?
MR. BUTLERs

Hot if the owner or occupant had

somehow retaken over the- premises and moved 3one,thing bach in.
or in any other way Indicated that he is either living in
them or using if; as an operational business•
Q

What if he just locks thus premises and secures

8

them against entry by third parties'?
MR. BUTLER:

A lest- of that would depend upon

precisely when he did that.
Q

Would that ever terminate the exigency

exception?
MR. BUTLER:

Yes, it certainly would at some point.

We contend™
Q
MR.

Can. v.e do that in this case?
butler:

No.

In this case the proprietor of

the premises was out of state for about seven days after the
fir©, until about seven days aftar the fira.
Q

Rnr: at the tirr.r of the search when they found

and the. glass or whatever it was, sera 22 or 23 day,,

latar, the prcof.aes were locked than, were they not?
MB.. BUTLER:

They ware locked and sealed by the.

fire department.
Q

Why did that not terminate the exigency then?

MR. SUTLER:

It clearly did.

By the time of that

/©arch.., the exigency was terminated.
Q

Then under* your view of the law, the search, was

improper, if I understand you.

MR. BUTLER:

Right, February—

Do you not have to sustain that search in order

Q

to sustain the conviction?
MR. BUTLER:
Your Honor.

We have to sustain that search, yes,

But we do not

believe we have to sustain it under

the exigent circumstance exception to the warrant requirement.
Who put the lock on the door?

Q

MR. BUTLER:

The firs department., perhaps in conjunc­

tion. with the police department.
Q
in vastly.? sices

It war soaled pending the completion of the

,

The

building was scaled by a lock put on it by the fire marshal
both to protect the property and-doring the course of his
inv-estiga. tion; is that correct?
MR. BUTLER:

Yes;, Year Honor.

The fire was put out:

ap;rx?:imr:V&%y tsOO aeai. on January 22nd, at which 'time the
fi

r partment boarded up all the windows and put their own

1ache and chains on all the; doors and than re-entered at 8:00
c

• clock the next morning and found what we agree is—was

indeed. 'lie censa of the fires by that time.
■

putting out the fire between midnight and approximately

10
a.ia, on January 22nd, that the finding only of two plastic
bottles, one partially filled with gasoline, -was itself the
cause of the fire, end that enabled them—that gave them -ycov.-fn
probable cause to obtain a search warrant.
Q

He are cent ft line- -•

Mr. Butler, I want to be- sure,

three pieces of evidence; hers?

Are there not

The first, what 'they picked a.

at the time of th© fire, the plastic container and the like.
MR. BUTLER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And there was no objection to its admission, as

I recall.
MR. BUTLER:

At least it was not challenged in the

Court below nor here.
Q

Avid th© second piece was what was discovered ah

tli® daylight entry the very next day.
MR. BUTLERr
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

A?.id th: cl: was admitted over objection and it-

,.t

issuo hero.
MR* BUTLER:

Yss, Your Honor.
-

Q

And then the third one--am l correct—was two

or three weeks later?
MR. BUTLER:
a re -entry,

About three or four weeks later there * as•

The reason for tha re-antry was that the photographs

take . by an -arson invest.igc.tor were lost in the mail.

He

some more photographs and, while
doing that, ha found a piece, of fuse and pieces of glass and

11
pieces of glass and debris, and those items were admitted
over

objsction.
Q

In any event, we have 'these three levels of

evidence, two of which axe under challenge at this point.
MR. BUTLERs

That is correct, Your Honor.

rv

However, in order to make vhi

the opinion of the Michigan Supreme Court, really there weru
other e: cries into- the building.

Ask! the principals of the

j/pi.-ic'B 1 :1c v would not allow, for sxample, oral testimony by
f:c arson investigate who went in four days after the fire.
Hod ho Hckan photographs or found physical evidence, it is
clear that they would have bsen challenged.
Q

When you talk about a warrant requirement, as

imposed by the Michigan Supreme Court, what inquiry would the
magistrate make in order to justify the issuance of a warrant
ossible inquiry which we
imagine'is simply wheth

or

e fir® occurred.

It seems

that if an. administrativa search warrant is to be allowed-' is
to be required to re-enter and determine the causa or origin
the fire, all

t ws should have to be able to show is that

fire occurred.
Q

C /--a Id you net, show that there worn two cawo

>f

gasoline sitting there?
MR. BUTLERs

He could show the fire occurred Just b

the condition of the building.

I *ra©iin, that is what did say

12
that a fire occurred as opposed—
Q

I mean, you do not

Could you not show that?

have gasoline* sitting around for fumigation purposes, do you?
MR, BUTLER:

I am not sure if Your Honor is suggesting

that we need a criminal warrant.

If that is the case, then

there is a close question of whether those two bottles of
gasoline are sufficient to prove that—
Q

I am talking about any kind of warrant.

MR. BUTLER;

If just im administrative warrant is

required, to dote min., the esns«

or origin, of the firs,; then the

No, we are not,

Q

Still you have been saying entry every time.

You keep saying entry.
MR, butler:

Would you be satisfied with a rule that you
t

could enter the building at any time you wanted to after a
fire to hunt for evidence and the cause but that nothing you
found could be admitted into evidence in the criminal prosecu­
tion unless you had & warrant?
MR. BUTLER:

No, we would be very dissatisfied with

a rule like that, Your Honor.
Q

You really fire gathering evidence, are you not'

it is a criminal investigation, among- other things.

MR. BUTLER:

Among other things, exactly, Your

Honor.
Q

Why is this arson crime any different from - cry

other cri-ne in tor;...-, of your ability to enter property to fhi.
evidence?

MR. butlers

Wo think it is different because there

is a legitimate need to enter the property anyway to make a
valid civil inspection and search for the cause of the fire,
another rrrpoct in which it is different is that—
•i

I knew, but you could serve that end by agreeing

rat to ur; the evidence in a criminal prosecution unless you
had & warrant.
MR. BUTLER:

That would be the most perverse rule

■

right to make these searches because there is a public interest

'i 4

for thorn.

But we will make one exception and give a benefit

only to arsonists and say that the evidence cannot be- used™
Q

No, but you are saying that only arsonists cannot

object to entry to property without a warrant.
MR, BUTLER;

We are saying -that arsonists are in a

special clas ; in that they way they have treated their own
property suggests that they have no protectable interest or

no interest remaining protected by the Fourt Amendment by nearly
any test axe-apt one -which requires total abandonment of any
property interests —

uction of someone' s own property is
so inconsistent with any notion of how the law is supposed to

Q

Mr* Butler, I would like ho go back to

Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question,
do it: you r.r-x to get a warrant?

Just what doss a magistrate
You go ir and prove a fire

took place axid some damage was incurred, period.

Is he not

automatically going to issue the warrant?
MR. BUTLER:

That is precisely our point, Your He ... .

That needs no exercise of special-'-

Q

That is only on tho assumption that you need hr

show probably cares to believe that a crime has bacn acmdt%?
If you assume that, why yon have assumed the case away.
MR. BUTLER:

Okay, if we are speaking of administer -

tivpj warrants, then you do r.ofe need probable cause to show that

16

& crime has occurred.
Q

You are assuming the case away again.

Q

When the marshal begins, is he locking for v

crime or is hn looking for a cause of a firs?
MR. BUTLER:

He is looking for the cause of a fire

which may—
Q

Incidentally he may then come to the conclusion

later that it was self-inflicted, that is, that it was arson.
Does it become a criminal investigation right at the outset?
MR. BUTLER:

Ifot at the outsat.

It can.

The point

is one® there is evidences of arson discovered, it. becomes—
area:* in still a cause of a fire.

And as far as using fire

It. does not say

But it

said, “As a state court we are now construing the law, the
state law of Michigan, an requiring a warrant."

Now, therefore,

do we not have before us a state law, as construed by the

Mr. Butler, supposing the state legislature hi .

expressly adopted a statute requiring a warrant and the
legislative history shored that the legislatures only did it

to do with whether a crime had occurred.

with whether a fire had occurred and the officials need to

Nor did

The thing that intrigues me about this case is the.
fact that the state- supreme court: has justifiably concluded
from the testimony of the participants that this was in fact a
criminal investigation from the early morning hours of January
22nd, beginning with Chief See’s declaration as to what the
cause and origin was, and I think that is significant when you
view what was don: here by the authorities, as the government’s
representatives, in literally sealing off this building and
keeping the occupant from his records—that in effect we have
not only a specific seizure but we

lave a total seizure of both

business records and the so-called tools of the crime.

that one would have a hard time convincing this Court that hs

his business records.

Now we are talking about possible Fifth

Amendment implications *
Q

Does the record indicate any.condition of

inherent Sangerousness after the fire in the structure?
MR. BACALIS:

There is absolutely nothing in the

record to indicate there was any inherent danger present •
the fire department left the scene.
Q

Would you say that the fire department or that

some public authority had an obligation to try to seal that
building and 3c

Lt and protect it from vandalism until the

Mr. Bacalls, your emphasis on the business

records—I cannot recall—were they admitted into evidence or
not?

MR. BACALIS:
Q

No, Your Honor? but they wore seized.

But they are not really before us.

MR. BACALIS:

No, I only offer that as an extent of

ths scope of the intrusion. Your Honor.
Q

But is not the constitutional question that we

are supposed to decide here precisely the same as if there had
never been any business record in the place at all?
MR. BACALIS:

That part is true, Your Honor, but I

think in looking at what took placa, I thought it. would be
helpful to the Court to u. •
by the governmental authority.

Q

But, for all w© know on this record, they may

Is that admissible in evidence?

MR. BACALIS:

I do not believe it is, Your Honor.

So that you think that without a warrant,

public authorities are entitled to determine cause, but if they
fin-5 evidence of a crime-;, -they cannot admit it?

Thsv cannot

introduce it unless they have a warrant?
MR. BACALIS:

Not unless they obtained that evidence

through i- he means of a v usssi; that is correct, Your Honor.
-Q

What if instead of taking something they merely
that would be evidence

took photographs of obj€
in support of arson?

Wr-uld those photographs be admissible

MR. BACALIS:

I believe that they would, be improper,

Your Honor, because they represent a search.

They do not

r:• present a ‘seizure, but at least they represent a search.

The phot graph is the mart, bect substitute for giving a visual
presentation to the trier.

Q

Suppose in stead of taking pictures the fire

marshalman, who makes these investigations to determine
cau>.a of fire, merely looks at them, sees them, makes notes,
and remembers them, and then-they

ider him as a witness.

Would you say his testimony is excludable?
MR. BACALIS:

I think so. Your Honor, on the theory

ately, so far as I know, there is no legislative pronouncement
as to how that is to be implemented, nor at this point are
there any judicial decisions that spell out how it should be

Maybe all this Court had in mind in that

That is right, Your Honor,

Mr. Bacalls, let rats make Justice White's factual
