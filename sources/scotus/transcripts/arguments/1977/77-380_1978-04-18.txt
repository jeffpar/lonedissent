MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Beale.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARA S. BEALE a ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. BEALE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes before the Court on the Government's
petition for review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, holding that water is a mineral subject to
location under the federal mining laws,

To put it another way,

the Court of Appeals held that rights to water on the public
domain are mineral rights which should be acquired pursuant to
the federal mining laws.
Since 1866, the federal mining laws have enabled
citizens to discover and extract valuable mineral deposits in
the public domain and to secure free title to lands containing
such discoveries.

A claimant must establish that he has dis­

covered a valuable mineral deposit within the limits of each
claim.

To show the value of such discovery, the claimant must

establish that a person of ordinary prudence would be justified
in the expenditure of both time and money with the reasonable
expectation that minerals from such a claim could be marketed

4
afc a profit.
At the outset; none of the parties in this case
viewed it as a water law case.

The disputed issue was, rather,

whether the Respondent could show a valuable and marketable dis­
covery of sand and gravel.
In 1942, Respondent's predecessor in interest had
located more than twenty placer mining claims in a narrow wash
on public lands about fifteen miles northwest of Las Vegas,
Nevada.

In the aggregate, these claims and several others

located a few years later, cover about 500 acres of land and
they encompass a massive deposit of an estimated 20 million
cubic yards of sand and gravel.
Until 1955* sand and gravel were subject to the
federal mining laws.

But in that year Congress withdrew

common variety minerals, including sand and gravel, from
location under the mining laws.

The Secretary of the Interior

initiated administrative proceedings in 1965 contending that
each of Respondent's 25 sand and gravel claims were invalid for
want of discovery of a valuable mineral prior to this 1955
withdrawal date,
A hearing was conducted at which the Secretary presented the testimony of a mining engineer who stated that the
excessive distance from these claims to the market in Las Vegas
and the lack of water to wash the material prevented profitable
marketing of this sand and gravel prior to the withdrawal date

5
in 1995«

Ifc is undisputed that water was first discovered on

these claims In 1962* when Respondent drilled a successful well
on Claim 22»

The presence or absence of -water was important

here because washing sand and gravel greatly increases its
ma rketabi1ity.
The Interior Board of Land Appeals credited the
testimony of a Government expert witness and concluded that
Respondent had established a valuable discovery of sand and
gravel on only one of the twenty-five claimed, the one from
which sizeable deposits had actually been removed prior to
1955.
QUESTION:
ignorance?

Mrs, Beale» would you help me out of my

A placer mine is a mine which involves the use of

water»isn’t it?
MRS, BEALE:

In most cases» I believe it does.

The

difference between a load and a placer claim» as I understand
it» a load claim is one where there is a vein of the mineral
running through» so that often one can cone In with a pick» or
whatever and get at that mineral» whereas the placer claims
usually involve a mineral more broadly disbursed throughout the
geographic limits of the claim.

So very often in the case of»

say» a gold placer claim» one would use water to wash out the
other materials and get at the valuable mineral,
QUESTION:
the use of water?

A placer mine doesn't Inevitably involve

6
MRS, BEALE:

I don’t believe so.

In the case of a

sand and gravel placer claim* it is useful only to wash the
water# but in this case •*■«=
QUESTION:

It was not actually necessary,

MRS, BEALE:

Right,

Respondent sought review of this decision in the
•District Court which satisfied the administrative decision ..as
arbitrary# capricious and not supported by the evidence.
court held that the

The

Interior Board had erred in crediting the

testimony of the Government's expert witness# found-credible
the Respondent’s evidence on the issue of marketability and it
concluded that at least the Claims Numbered 1 through 16 had
been found valid.

Moreover# it concluded that the Respondent

should be permitted access to Claim 22 in order to make use of
the ivater produced by the well.
The District Court did not offer any legal basis for
offering access to the water on Claim 22,

The Court of Appeals

affirmed the decision of the District Court with one significant
addition.

It held that Claim 22# itself# was also valid because

the water that Respondent had discovered on that claim was
itself a locatable mineral under the mining laws.
The parties had neither briefed nor argued this Issue,
The court# however# looked to the mining laws and found that
there was no provision that expressly defined water as a non»
mineral.

The court stressed the fact that the rec ov ery

7
procedures used in the case of many hard minerals required the
use of water.

Therefore# it found that it should not assume

that Congress had been unaware of what the court called "the
necessary glove of water for the hand of mining."

And it had

made no provision for the necessary acquisition of water rights
for the operation of such claim.

Accordingly# it concluded that

Congress must have intended that water itself 'Should be locat~
able as a mineral.
In the case of Claim 22# the court held that the
evidence established the discovery of a valuable mineral# first#
because water has an intrinsic value in a desert area and#
moreover# because Respondent’s use of the water to wash his
sand and gravel# thereby increasing the value of the sand and
gravel# show that there was a profitable market for the water#
and that it was a valuable mineral deposit.
The Government submits that the Court of Appeals’
conclusion that water is a locafcable mineral disregards the
intent of Congress,
QUESTION:

That’s the only question you've brought

here# isn’t it?
MRd 0 BEALE:

That’s correct.

In our petition# we

note that there are other respects in which we believe the
Court of Appeals had erred# but vie did not raise those in this
case.
We believe chat the decision disregards the intent of

8
Congress as expressed in the mining laws themselves, that the
acquisition of private water rights on the public domain should
be governed by state and local laws, therefore not by the federal
mining laws.
The court's decision, in our view, also disregards the
i

precedence of both this Court and of the longstanding adminis»
trafeive interpretation of the Department of Interior.

The

promise of the Court of Appeals opinion is that Congress did
not expressly define water as a non-mineral, and that it made
no express provision for the acquisition of water rights neces­
sary to work mineral claims.
QUESTION:

Do you think the 1955 legislation has any­

thing to do with the issue in this case?
MRS» BEALE:

Well, the 1955 legislation to which I

believe you are referring is the one which withdrew the common
variety minerals and it specifies the minerals, sand, gravel,
.pumice, I believe, fossilized bone —
QUESTION:

It specifies all

I couldn't find the

language of the legislation in the paper here, but it specifies
every -MIS, BEALE:

It specifies the minerals.

And, indeed,

we note in, I believe, both in our petition and in our brief
that there is a provision in the 1955 legislation indicating
f

that there was no intent to interfere with state water laws.
And x^e think that buttresses not only our conclusion that the

9
mining laws do not Effect water laws* but should water be held
to be a locatable mineral it would make it Impossible to some­
how construe., in my view* the provision of removal of . common
variety as applicable to water®
The premise of the Court of Appeals opinion was that
since there was no express provision for any acquisition of
water rights that are necessary to work mineral claims* and the
court thought that Congress must have Intended to provide scsae
mechanism so that miners could acquire these rights.

And*

therefore* it must have Intended the only provision which the
court saw at' hand*the mineral laws themselves* to apply to the
acquisition of water rights.
The premise for this reasoning is false.

The general

mining laws..since their inception in l866*have provided separ™
afeely for the right to mine valuable minerals on the one hand
and for the acquisition of water rights on the other hand.
Congress did recognize from the outset the critical role that
water played in mining operations. But instead of establishing
a federal statutory system to govern the acquisition of private
water rights on public lands3 as it set out the system for the
right to acquire minerals* instead Congress chose to ratify the
rights that were recognized under state and the local laws that
were developing in "the arrld regions to allocate water among the
competing uses* including mining.

Both the general mining laws

enacted in 1866 and in 1870 contained separate provisions

10
regarding water rights.

These provisions were left unchanged

when Congress enacted the 1872 .mining law and they are now
codified at beet ion 51 and 52 of Title 30.

They are reprinted

at page 2 of the Government’s brief.
section 51, which was part of the mining law of 1866,
provides that rights acquired by priority of possession to the
use of water on public lands, rights that are recognized and
acknowledged by local customs, laws and decisions of the court
should be maintained and protected.

Then, in 1870, Congress

enacted what is now Section 52 which provides additionally
that any patents granted or homesteads allowed are subject to
vested and accrued water rights acquired or recognized under
Section 51.
Congress, thus, expressly provided in the mining laws,
themselves, that the acquisition of private water rights on the
public domain is governed by state and local law, not by the
federal mining laws.

Other public land laws, particularly the

esert Land Act of 1877.* advents the same intent to sanction
water rights acquired in accord with state law, rather than to
establish a new and separate system of federal law.
QUESTION:

That was our holding in Beaver Portland

Cement, wasn 't it?
MRb. BEALL:
was going to say.

That's precisely the very next thing I

This Court has recognized that Intent and

in particular in California Oregon Power Co. v. Beaver Portland

Cement, the Court sa:ld as follows about these two provisions.
The Court said that provisions of the 1866 and l87®"mining,,:
laws

and this is a quote — "approve and confirm the policy

of appropriation for a beneficial use, as recognized by local
rules and customs and the legislation and the judicial decisions
of the arrid land states as the tax and the measure of public
rights into the non-navigable waters on the public domain.'
The inclusion in the mining laws of these specific
provisions for the acquisition of water rights precludes any
inference that Congress intended the federal law of mining
claims to guide any acquisition of water rights.

The Court of

Appeals, however, was apparently unaware of this provision and
of the decisions of this Court concerning them.

Contrary then,

to the Court of Appeals belief that it would be advancing the
■4

purposes of the mining laws, instead, it's interpretation of the
mining laws would defeat what this Court recognized as Congress'
clear intent that the acquisition of such rights should be
governed by the state and local laws.
Congress was well aware that the Western States were
gradually developing a system of water laws that was especially
suited for the needs of that arrid region.

And Congress, obvi­

ously, intended that water rights on the public domain would be
acquired in accordance with this especially suitable system.
We believe, therefore, that a reading of the mining
laws, as a whole, leaves no doubt as to Congress' intent to

12

treat water rights as separate and distinct from-the right - to
mine valuable minerals.

But even if these provisions were un­

clear, any possible doubt on this score has long since been re­
moved by the administrative decisions of department of the
Interior which is charged -with regulating the acquisition of
rights in the public lands,
QUESTION:

Mrs. Beale, do you think jrour position here

Is fully consistent with the position the United States has taker,
before, say, in the original Number 8 where is Involved a
Reclamation Service dam in California, and the question is
whether or not -- one of the questions was whether the United
States to get Its water rights must comply with state law?
MRS. BEALE;
consistent.

I think the position here is completely

The question of whether federal water* rights

QUESTION:

You mean the Congressional acts up to

date shouldn't be understood to bind the United States?
MRS. BEALE:
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:

No, I don't think that —
Or the Reclamation Service.
I don't mean to draw that distinction.

What I am saying Is -- or what I mean to say -- is that in the
mining laws and in the desert Land Act Congress is speaking to
the acquisition of private rights, the rights of homesteaders,
the rights of individual —
QUESTION:

Why wasn't It speaking to how the United

states should get its rights?

13
MRS, B3ALG:

Well, as this Court recognized in the

California Oregon Power Co. case, the United States, initially,
had, in the public land states, rights -- ownership rights of
not only the land but the water,

And in the California Oregon

Power Co, ease, this Court said that it viewed the intent of
Congress as intending to give out land patents,on the one hand,
under one system, under the mining laws, under the agricultural
entry laxvs, under the nosert Land Act, and also to provide a
way whereby private rights to waters on the public domain could
be acquired,
That seems to me to be a different question from what
happens when the Federal Government needs to use certain water
rights.

If they have not been given out to private individuals,

then the questions are entirely different, I would think.
QUESTION:

In any event, if I understand your argu­

ment, it is that however this case is decided it has no relevant
impact upon that other litigation.
MRS, BEALE:
QUESTION:

I believe that is correct, yes.
Certainly a private claimant, for example,

would have no claim for water under the implied reservation
doctrine, although that was not relied upon by the Government
in the original Number 3.

But that's certainly an example of

a way a governmental right might be different from a private
right.
MRb . B..AL :

It certainly is.

And I think the

14
reservation doctrine is based upon the notion that Congress had
those water rights at the time that it set aside and reinforced
certain purpose.

Congress had those water rights.

party is in the same position.

No private

And it is a question of inter­

preting the intent of Congress in the mining laws as to how
private rights would be acquired., which is really quite separate
from the reservation.
QUESTION:

Why isn't it arguable, though, that by

granting mining claims the United States impliedly grants water
rights, or reserves them for that purpose?
MRS. BEALE:

If Congress had not expressly provided

in the mining laws that right acquired under state and local
law

water rights, excuse me -« acquire under state and local

law — should be acquired under state and local law and would
be recognized by the Federal Government, and if Congress had
not in' other statutes, such as the desert Land Act, indicated
that there was this division, that might have been a possible
interpretation.
If the Court were to view the provisions as ambigu­

ous, however, the decisions of the department of Interior,
beginning in the 1880s, shortly after the adoption of the
Mining Law of 1872.? resolved any doubt, the department held,
unambiguously, that water claims could not be patented under
the mining law, but must be acquired, instead, under state law.
do that, to the extent that the Court might find the

15

statutes ambiguous,, that doubt. I would say. has long since been
resolved by the consistent interpretation of the department
charged with administering the public land laws.

And that view

of the statutes was reaffirmed as recently as 1976, in a compre­
hensive decision which we have reprinted in our petition for
certiorari.

We believe that given the fact that this long­

standing interpretation has prevailed for a century and has
been the basis for a settled system of property rights, it
should be virtually conclusive at this point.
The recent decision of the Interior Board of Land
Appeals on this point, to which I referred, convincingly demon­
strates the soundness of that department's view.

They relied

not only upon the theory of this Court in the California Oregon
Power Cot. case, which looked to the structure of the mining
laws themselves and the fact that Congress had provided, on the
one hand, for the acquisition of water rights, and on the other
hand, for the acquisition of the right to mine valuable minerals.
But the Board also took a very common-sense view of Congress 1
intent in using the term "minerals."

It recognized that if

Congress had intended the statute, the mining laws and the use
of the term "minerals" to be given the broadest possible defini­
tion of the term, such as when one speaks of the division of
all matter into animal, vegetable and mineral, and intended
that all matter that could be classified as mineral in that
sense, to be locatable under the mining laws, then all the

16

public lands would be mineral lancis.

If this were so, there

would have been no need for separate provisions in the many
public land laws dealing with non-mineral lands, permitting
agricultural entry, and so forth.
Congress clearly, as the Interior Board recognized,
could not have intended the term "mineral" to be given such a
broad definition, which would make nonsense of the mining laws
and of so many of the other public land laws.
The Board also noted
consideration

and this is an important

that the location of water, as a mineral, would

invite the widespread use of the mining laws by persons who
were seeking public lands for other purposes, who would attempt
to take advantage of the widespread occurrence of water and the
relative ease with which mining claims may be patened,
QUESTION:

Isn't that one reason that Congress acted

the way it did in 1955 to eliminate sand and gravel patents, is
that people were really getting the patents not for the valuable
sand and gravel but because they wanted the acreage?
MRS., BEALE:

That’s precisely correct.

The legisla­

tive history of that provision indicates clearly that the loca­
tion of sand and gravel claims were being .misused and that they
were being used to acquire land for residential purposes, and
all sorts cf purposes not comprehended in the mining laws.

And

the Interior Board of Land Appeals concluded that the very same
abuses would be invited if water, itself, which is of such

17

common occurrence, could be located under the mining laws.
It was relatively easy to acquire a mining claim and it would
invite abuse for that reason.
Now, we have no figures available that would tell
precisely how many acres of public land might contain water
which could be discovered, but it seems relatively clear that
millions of acres of public land would be affected.
We believe that setting aside the long-established
administrative and judicial construction of the mining laws
would throw established rights into question and would, there­
fore, completely unsettle the law of water rights throughout
the western states.
The Court of Appeals .decision, because it does not
acknowledge the existence of the xvater rights provisions
adopted as part of the mining laws, does not give any hint
whether that court's opinion should be viewed as holding that
the location of mineral claims to water rights is the exclusive
method by which private water rights on the public domain could
be obtained.
Perhaps, it might have intended that there was to be
an alternative method to state laws, but if that decision were
interpreted as holding that the only way that one could acquire
water rights, on the public domain, is under the mineral mining
laws, then private rights long since considered throughout the
West itfould presumably be invalidated.

18

Respondent seeks to avoid this obviously undesirable
result and to interpret the Court of Appeals' decision somewhat
more narrowly* arguing that the mining laws should be viewed
as merely an alternative to state procedures.

However*

Respondent offers no evidence that Congress actually intended
to create such an unmanageable, dual system.

Harmonizing the

rights acquired under the two systems would be a difficult task
and one that would surely generate extensive litigation.

More­

over* the mining laws were never designed to allocate water
rights and we believe they are ill suited to this task.
Respondent has failed to suggest any reason why this
Court should reverse all prior judicial and administrative
interpretations of the mining lav/s to reach such a result.
We believe that the administrative interpretation
of the mining claims* the decisions of this Court and examina­
tion of the structure of the mining laws themselves* each
compels the conclusion that Congress did not* in fact* intend
water rights on the public domain to be located under the
federal mining laws. But rather that it intended that such
rights would be acquired pursuant to state and local laws,
We* therefore* respectfully submit that the decision
of the Court of Appeals should be reversed* insofar as it holds
that the water on Claim 22 was subject to location under the
mining laws.

Mr. Levenberg.

19

ORAL ARGUMENT 0? GERRY LEVENBERG, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEVENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court;
In our viex-tf, the Government makes too much of Sections
9 and 17 of the 1866 and 1870 provisions of the mining laws.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't this Court make quite a bit

of them in Beaver Portland Cement case,, written by Justice
Sutherland who is, himself, regarded on an expert on western
water law?
MR, LEVENBERG:
garded.

Your Honor, he certainly was so re­

He discussed those provisions at some length in the

opinion, as we acknowledge in our brief.

But I think that a

fair reading of that decision suggests that the Court did not,
in fact, hold that the sole means by which water rights could
be obtained under the mining laws was by appropriation under
the state laws,
QUESTION:

Well, do you think it is unfair to say

that most western lawyers involved in water law

have read that

decision to mean that those two acts severed the water from the
land and left the water to acquisition by state law?
MR, LEVENBERG:

I don't think that is unfair to say

either, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

But you now say that perhaps those lawyers

were wrong in reading the decision that way?

20

MR. LEVENBERG:

What we try to say is that, as we

set forth in the brief, especially at pages 16 through 18, that
what was Involved in Beaver Por tland were not claims under the
mining laws of 1866.» 1870 or 1872.

There were two separate

claims to water by two private parties, one under the Homestead
Act of 1862, the other under the Oregon State Water Codec And
the Court concluded and held in that case what the provisions
of the ..'esert Land Act meant.

It did not hold, we submit, that

the only means by which water could be obtained under the mining
laws was by state appropriation.
QUESTION:

But If the j esert Land Act .severed the

water from the land, didn’t that mean that no further water
could be acquired in the same way that you could acquire other
mineral patents?
MR* LEVENBERG:

Insofar as . esert Land Act entries,

Homestead Act entries. Preemption Act entries were concerned,
that is precisely what Justice Sutherland said.

He was a man

who, as you pointed out, wrote quite carefully.

There is no

Indication anywhere in Justice Sutherland!s opinion,and the
Government points to none, which states specifically that with
respect to claims under the mining lav/s ~~ and that's what's
involved here ~~ with respect to those claims, the sole means
by which water may be obtained is under state appropriation.
There was no edict from this Court, If you please, which said
henceforth Mining Act patents shall sever land from water.

21

QUESTION:

Were you troubled at all by the Ninth

Circuit's failure to refer at all to the Beavor Portland Cement
case and its opinion in this case?
MR» LEVENBERG;

Obviously, Your Honor, we would have

preferred for the Ninth Circuit to spell out in greater detail
the basis for its holding»

We do wish to make it very clear

that we are not contending, as the Government appears to attrib­
ute to us, that with respect to vested water rights, pursuant to
Section 9 of the 1866 Act and Section IT of the 1870 Act, that
rights which have already vested and rights which vest tomorrow
should not be protected.

That is not our position»

Our position

very simply, is that the plain language of the Act of 1872,which
states that "all valuable minerals" -- all —- "may be discovered"
is what Congress meant to say and, in the absence of a with-,
drawal by Congress, as you pointed out, and as the Government
points out, it did in 1955 when it removed certain common
variety minerals — In the absence of a withdrawal from the
broad provisions of the 1872 Act of specified minerals, that
that general grant of authority prevails.
Our position is that with respect to rights that have
already vested — and that's the language of Section 9, and
that's the language of Section 17 ~~ rights which have vested
and accrued, those rights remain vested and accrued.

And

nothing that this Court could decide in this case, affirming
the lower court's opinion, would derogate from those vested

22
rights»
The Government argues that it would leave an unmanage­
able. system,

The Government does not explain why the system is

any more manageable today, in circumstances where a state ap­
propriation, with respect to a given portion of water that runs
during particular times of the year or particular specified
i

flows and leaves to be claimed what is left of that residuum
of rights under state law, is any more manageable -~
QUESTION:

But, of course, the two tests are quite ...

different, though, aren't they?

If you are talking about how

you acquire a mineral claim, it's a prudent man thinking that
there is valuable mineral and place on the claim.
MR, LEVENBERG:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And on yc-ur water claim, under most

western state appropriative systems, it doesn't depend upon
value, it depends upon prior and beneficial use.
MR. LEVENB3RG:

Yes, Your Honor, that's absolutely

correct.
Our point is, again in response to the parade of
horribles that the Federal Government sets forth in this case
that would prevail if we prevail, the answer to that is, in our
viex^, that the very requirement that a demonstration be made
that the mineral is valuable, the very requirement of the
prudent man test, the very requirement of the marketability
test is sufficient to insulate claims that would lead to abuse.

23

We have no quarrel with the proposition that, of
course, the tests are different under a state appropriation and
under the mining laws of 1872»

But that does not, in our view,

lead inexorably to the conclusion, as the Government would have
it, that when Congress said in 1866 and in 1870 that we will
respect those water rights that have vested and accrued under
state law, that it was saying that was the only manner in which
water rights could be obtained»
support for that.

We don't believe there is

And we don't think that Mr» Justice Sutherland

and this Court decided that issue in the Beaver Portland case.
The argument that the Government makes about the long­
standing Interpretation of the Interior Department does not take
into account that, as this Court has made clear, while con­
struction of legislation by departments charged with adminis­
tering the legislation is, Indeed, entitled to deference,

TMs

Court is not, thereby, permitted to abdicate its function of
reviewing the wisdom and correctness of that interpretation.
And, in particular, I cite to the Court its decision in an
opinion by Justice Harlan in Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 109 at
328.
The abuse argument that is relied upon so heavily by
the Government, it seems to me, was, indeed, answered,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, by what Congress did in the 1955 Act.
When it was confronted with circumstances which demonstrated
that abuses of the mining law had been taking place, the

Congress responded.

And it did so on the basis of evidence

No, sir.

MR. LEVSNB.ORG:

That appears to be the case.

of abuse, should not prevail here,

faction of that political body that its lav/ ought to be amended,

Well, did the Ninth Circuit arrive at

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Counsel, you may continue,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERRY LEVENBERG, ESQ., (Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, LEVENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At the buzzer, Mr. Justice White, you were asking
whether we came to this clain by Inadvertence or accident.
As indicated, the issue that is briefed here was not
briefed below, but I do invite to your attention page 15A of
the Appendix to the Government's petition for certiorari, a
description by the court below of the nature of our location
notices.

And I, quote:

"Each of the location notices, covering

Claims 1 through 22, described a,‘piece of mineral-bearing
ground as .a placer claim' as distinguished from a claim
location of any particular mineral, either surface or under­
ground, within that tract of ground.”
But It is true that the matters that are being briefed
and argued here were not briefed or argued below,
I would like, if I may, to address a more fundamental
question that you posed this morning to counsel for the Govern­
ment, and that is whether the Government's position here is
Inconsistent with the Government’s position in California v.
United States,

The Government, net surprisingly, says, of

27

course* ifc isn’t.

We think it clearly is.

Government argues in California v. United States that
Section 8 of the Reclamation Act* which it describes in its
brief in this ease as similar in nature to Sections 9 and 17
of the mining laws

the Government takes the position in

California v* United States* as it has in virtually every case
involving Section 8* that in spite of the language written by
Congress in the Reclamation Act* protecting the state’s concerns
and interests with respect to water -QUESTION:

And despite the Desert Land Act.

MR. LEVENBERG;

And despite the Desert Land Act ~~

that a narrow reading of Section 8 is required; whereas* in this
case* the broadest conceivable reading of Section 9 and Section
17 is required.
QUESTION:

But your case doesn't turn* anyway* on

Section 8 of the Reclamation Act.
MR. LEVENBERG;

No* sir, it does not.

It turns on the

laguage in Section 1 of the Mining Law of 187'2* which says
all valuable minerals* except as otherwise —
QUESTION:

It doesn't turn at all on the Reclamation

Act of 1902?
MR. LEVENBERG:
the Reclamation Act,

No*

We are not basing our claim on

We do address in our brief what we regard

to be the Government's inconsistent position with respect to
what it now calls an unmanageable dual system that would be

28

brought about by the decision of the Court of Appeals below.
And we suggest to you., most respectfully, that the unmanageable
duel system that the Government so fears, as a result of this
case, It fosters and presses in particular in the reservation
doc trine cases and in particular in the case that is pending
before this Court and will be argued next week, New Mexico y.
United. States.,
QUESTION;

Now, the reservation doctrine is not in­

volved in California v. United States»
MR, UEVSNBSRG:

No, it is notto the best of my

'knowledge it is not.
I was moving on from what we regard to be the in- •
consistency of the Government's position with respect to its
attitude that Section 8 of the Reclamation Act, although it
purports to protect state interests, must be read very narrowlyj
whereas, the language of Section 9 and Section 17 of the Mining
Law, the Government argues should be read in its broadest terms,
and going beyond, as we see it, the protection of vested rights.
The Government, in its brief in this case, at page 20,
in a footnote, refers to the Federal Potver Act as another ex­
ample of the kind of act that was based upon the sort of concerns
the Government perceives in Sections 9 and 17 of the Mining Law.
The fact is that this Court in First Iowa made it very clear
•— and this Court in Arizona v. California confirmed that Section
27 of the Federal Power Act, upon which the Government ~~ to

29
which the Government adverts in its brief, was no more than a
savings clause

saving, and I now quote from Footnote 92 of

this Court's decision in Arizona v, California:

"See First

Iowa where this Court limited the effect of Section 27 of the
Federal Power Act which expressly saved certain state laws to
vested property rights."
That's precisely the position that we take here.
That's what is at issue here,in cur judgment, the extent to which
i:\tate water rights are to be protected under the Mining Laws of
1872, as Congress has so clearly said are vested state rights.
And we do not argue, as the Government would like to attribute
(;o us, that those rights must have vested prior to 1866 or prior
to 1870.

We say that they could vest tomorrow, so long as they

(rested prior to the discovery of water as a locafcable mineral,
under the lav/ of 1872,
Wow, with respect to the Government's position, insofar
■is the reservation doctrine is concerned, we think that it is
worth inviting to the Court's attention, contrary to the argument
that was made earlier by the Government of no inconsistency,
what the holder of mining claims in the Gila Forest that is in­
volved in the New Mexico case to be argued next week, views the
Government position in that case as contrasted to the Government's
position articulated in its brief in this case.

stated:

"In Charles tone the Government argues that the decision

of the Court of Appeals In that_case ’would east doubts on
right long thought to be established under state and local law
and would unsettle the law of water rights in the western

states. 1 !l
That's a quote from their brief in this case.* the
Government's brief»
We agree* but find the Government's position there to
be irreconcilable with its position in this case»

Here, the

Government argues*that is* in New Mexico* that private water
rights which have evolved over the last 100 years to be subjected
to an undefined reserved water right of the United States* citing
the U*S. brief in the New Mexico case at page 30.

Although the

Government does not address the consequences of its assertion*

It follows from the Government claim for reserved water for the
present and future needs —citation of the Government's brief
•— of the federal course for "aesthetics* recreation* etcetera*
that the very same rights which the Government seeks to preserve
in Charlestone will be seriously undermined if its position here
is accepted,"
We think that it is quite clear that the dual system*
the dual management system, which the Government contends would
be brought about by affirmance of the Court of Appeals' decision
below is here.

It’s already here.

The Government makes a reser­

vation claim of an unquantified* undetermined amount.

There are

31

Interests that it seeks to protect in that case that are private
interests.

The Government’s brief there points out that it has

issued l600 permits to cattle raisers to roam 29>000 cattle
through the forest.

Those are private rights.

The Court of Appeals below did not invent or create
the dual management system.
rights, in the 1872 law.

Congress did, with respect to mining

Congress said all valuable minerals

may be subject to location and the lands they are on subject

QUESTION:

You could be quite right in your argument,

Z suppose, about the relationship between the mining laws and
the .jesert Land Act and still lose just because water isn't a
mineral.
MR. LEVENBERG:

That's conceivable.

That is con­

ceivable,
QUESTION:

How about that question?

MR, LEVENBERG:
QUESTION:

Well, we think that —

The 1 apartment-of Interior's position has

been consistently that water isn't a mineral,

Has the department of the Interior ever

taken the position that water is a mineral, but It just so happens

that it is not disposable of under the mining laws?
MR* LEVENBERG:

No,

QUESTION:. They have never said water is a mineral?
MR, LEVENBERG:

Not to the best of my knowledge.

But

they have made the decision* so far as I am aware* in the context
of reference to Section 9 and Section 17* that water rights are
something to be taken care of ~QUESTION:

That may be so* but there is still the

question of whether water is a mineral,
MR, LEVENBERG:
QUESTION:

That *s true,

What about that question?

MR, LEVENBERG:

We think that while ~~ as we point

out in our brief — the judicial authority on that is really
quite sparse.

There is not very much on it,

QUESTION:

So why do we have to get to the argument

about water rights and mining laws?

What about the threshold

question about whether water1 Is a mineral?
MR, LEVENBERG:

VJe argue — and I believe that there

is sound authority for our position — that water Is a mineral*
that it was regarded by the Congress as a mineral and that the
question whether water is a 1ocatable mineral really depends
upon whether those who claim' it can demonstrate that it is
valuable -«* which Is a key word* as we see it* in the 1872 law
— and that demonstration and that Issue have very well articu­
lated standards that have been set forth by this Court and

QUESTION:

Were gas and oil Iccafcable minerals?

MR, LEVENBERG:

Gas and oil are dealt with separately

under separate statutes.
QUESTION:

I know, but Is it a mineral — are they

minerals, within the meaning of that law?.
-MR. LEVENBERG:

Of the Mining Law of 1872?

No, because the Mining Lav; of 1872 begins, with the
language, "except as otherwise provided."

And then there are

specific, Identifiable statutes that deal with the discovery of
gas and oil, as there are with respect to the discovery of coal,
potassium, phosphate and a number of other minerals.
QUESTION;

Well, your answer Is not no, but yes.

Gas and oil probably are minerals, but not dealt with under
this statute.
MR, LEVENBERG:

I am sorry. But not locatable minerals

'under the Mining Law of 1872, that's correct,
QUESTION:

Would you. say that earth qua earth is a

mineral?
MR, LEVENBERG;

Well, the Government argues that that

Is the inexorable consequence of this Court affirming the Court
of Appeals decision below.

No, I would not say that earth qua

{jarth is a loeafcable -~
QUESTION:

Why isn't It?

MR, LEVENBERG:

Because it Isn't a mineral?

Well, we are not at all «— The standard

34
still is whether it is a valuable mineral, and whether in the
context of the claim that has been made -QUESTION:

I just bought some soil the other day and

it is pretty expensive*
MR* LEVEN3ERG:

I am sure that it was, but we do not

claim* nor do you have to decide in this case that earth is a
1 ocatable mineral»
QUESTION:

But you1ve got to show us some way to tell

why water is and earth isn't* other than just saying that it has
to be valuable# because certainly by the standard of value you
can say that a 20-acre placer claim# eons is ting solely of earth,
is valuable by the prudent man standard.
QUESTION:

I asked the question what Congress Intended

by the word "mineral." At least that’s one question.

It might

not have intended to include water* even if water is a mineral.
MR, LEVENBERG:
Honor.

That is certainly conceivable* Your

The fact is that there is very* very little in the

legislative history of the 1872 mining law.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be reasonable* as the Court

has often said# that we read legislation in terms of what -- of
the ordinary meaning given by ordinary people to the words used
at the time they were used?

In 1872# did they regard water as

a mineral?
MR* LEVENBERG;

There is no evidence that water was

not regarded as a mineral* Mr* Chief Justice*

35
QUESTION:

Well* is there any evidence that it was

regarded as a mineral?
MR, LEVENBERG:

Well* I think that it is reasonable

to argue that the attention that the Congress devoted to water
by excluding those vested water rights* within the mining law,
is evidence that Congress* Indeed* regarded water to be —
QUESTION:

How do most dictionaries define "minerals"?

Do they include water?
MR* LBVENBERG:
QUESTION;

1 am afraid I can't answer that.

I can give you a little help,

I looked at

five of them and none of them included water and all of them had
a common denominator of solids as -MR» LEVENBERG:

Well* the Ninth Circuit, again* in

•

I don’t know what the dictionary says.
QUESTION:

Sometimes therevare minerals in suspension

in water or minerals in suspension in other fluids* but does
that make water, per se* a mineral?
MR. LEVEMBERG:

No* I would not think that it does.

I think that the best evidence that there Is that the
Congress regarded water as a mineral xn the mining laws is the

36
fact that it was concerned to he sure that those local customs
:>f the states and territories* insofar as the acquisition of
water rights to that time were protected* in the 1866 and the
1870 Act.
I would leave it there.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mrs. Beale* do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARA S, BEALS. ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. BEALE;

Just one or two very brief points.

First of the Court’s question as to generally what
is a mineral,

The Government would contend that there is no

one single definition of the term ''mineral” for all purposes,
I would point out to the Court that originally the mining laws
— or at least at some point in their history — were construed
to apply to oil and gas which were later then dealt with more
specifically in the mineral leasing laws.
QUESTION;
MRS . BEALE:

Oil was e. mineral, for those purposes?
It is my understanding that oil was

considered a mineral.
QUESTION:

If one proceeds on the childhood game that

everything is animal* mineral or vegetable* certainly water is
a mineral* isn’t it?
MRU„ BEALS:

That’s correct.

And we think that kind

of a very bread definition* as the Interior Board of Land Appeals

37
said* Just makes no sense in this context*
I would think that we would have to agree that within
the broadest definition of the term "mineral''* as in animal,
vegetable and mineral* water is included- dirt is included*
and we don't think that there is any suggestion or any evidence
that that’s what Congress was thinking of when it allowed the
exploration and discovery of valuable minerals*
QUESTION:

So* you think you must go to some other

statutory plan to get water out from under the word "mineral"?
MRS» BEALE:
would phrase it.

I don’t think that is quite the way I

I think when we look at the mineral statutes*

the mining statutes* themselves* we see water treated separately.
QUESTION:

What if there were no Desert Land Act?

MRS. BEALS;

And no provision in the 1866 and 1970

mining laws* themselves?

Then I would think that x^e would rely

upon the Interior Board of Land Appeals’ construction.

I would

think that would be very weighty as to how —
QUESTION:

And they just say water wasn’t Intended to

be a mineral?
MRS „ BEALE;

That’s exactly correct* from the 1880s

on in a whole series of decisions* which we find very persuasive.
j

QUESTION: What do they say about mineral water?
MRS, BEALE; The ..esert Springs case says that that
Is not a mineral.
The only other point that I would like to draw to

38
the Court's attention is that Respondent has tried to emphasise
the narrowness of this decision and the fact that if the mineral
laws were construed as an alternative way of acquiring water
\

rights that really wouldn’t unsettle the law, the Western Water
Law, it wouldn’t throw established rights into question* and so
forth.

But the very point upon which the Court of Appeals and

Respondent rely is the fact that a mining claim need not specify
what mineral it is locating for.

As the claims here didn’t

indicate sand and gravel or water allow someone later —~ these
claims were located in 19^2 and now, at this late date, it is
possible for Respondents to claim that they were locating for
water.

There are many claims outstanding that were located in

19.40--195Oj whenever, and it would be possible now to attempt to
validate those on the theory that water was present.
And one can imagine, of course, the difficulties
that trying to harmonize those rights with the rights acquired
under state law would cause.
The final point is that, the Court of Appeals’ theory,
at least, was that the value of the mineral deposits here was
shown by the fact that v;ater has an intrinsic value in the
desert region,
i

And it seems to me if that construction were

adopted it would substantially lessen the impact of the prudent
man and marketability tests, and so forth.

If you could find

water, you could argue under this decision that your claim.,
/

simply by showing that water was present in an arrid area, would

39
show a valuable discovery.
QUESTION:
we

Mrs. Beale, in order to decide this case,

don’t have to say, in front of God and everybody else, that

water is a mineral, do we?
MRS. BEALE:
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:

That water —
Is a mineral.
No.

.00

we?

Our contention is that water is not

a locatable mineral under these laws, under the mining laws.
If there are no other questions —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:18 o’clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
