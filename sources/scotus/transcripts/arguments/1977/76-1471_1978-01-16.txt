ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF ALL PRIVATE PETITIONERS
MR, GRISWOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court;
These cases are here on petition

for certiorari

to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for
'ih.s District of Columbia Circuit.

Th-*re ara inanj parties -and

All arise out of the ownership of a newspaper

md. of i broadcast facility, television or radio# in the same
community byths same interests,

in the terras, of the trade

'this is known as cross ^ownership.
The issues hare ire suit from an order of the Federal
Communi s&ticsks Commission made .in 1975 after five years of
herrings,

This was & rale-making proceeding, and the result

is known as the Commission1 n Second Report and Order,

it

occupies most of the first volume of the Appendix from pagos

The rula mnotmeed by lines Commission was that it

the prospective rule.

Thin is known as

But the Commission also determined that

it would not apply this rule retroactively; that is, that it.
would tot refusa to renew existing licenses solely on the
ground of cross-ownership.

This is known as the grandfather

provision of th® rule.
There was, however, an exception to the grandfather,
rule,

in 16 small market situations where there was no other

newspaper and no othea: comparable broadcast facility r th©
Commission did .apply its now rule to existing licensees,

it

said that they must divest either th© newspaper or fcha
broadcast facility by 19 SO
Numerous appeals were taken to the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbca.

The 'federal Communications

Commission naturally dafended its order.

But the Department

of Justice itfcaokad it, fit. govern.r-.-snt spsaxing with ©any
voices, particularly with respect to the grandfather provision.The Court cf -Appeals last M.arch affirmed .the
prospective order.

But it found that th© grandfather previelex

was invj.3i.d because, it said, it was not rational.

It held

evidence clearly demonstrates that cross-ownership is in th®
public interest. w

judgment of the Court, those

6
portions of the order that have retroactive effect and those
portions dealing with existing combinations are vacated, and

In this Court there are widely divergent interests»
I represent the private parties, newspapers and broadcast
stations, and the American Newspaper Publishers Association
and the National Association of .Broadcasters»

Some of my

clients are concerned with the prospective rule and others
are primarily concerned with the grandfather question.

seme newspaper-radio combimaidens which seem t© be at some
risk of being lost in the shuffle,

MR, GRISWOLD:

That would certainly b© a ground to.

determining whether the license should be renewed,

MR. GRISWOLD:

We are dealing hare

with a blanket rule which says that if you arcs ir. common
ownership with a newspaper

you cannot receive a license ,

Now, whether you get a renewal or not is the question of the.
grandfather rule, which is the next part of my argument.

Say one newspaper in a two-newspaper town

wants to marge with the other f and 1st us suppose that the
existing statute that allows that in some circumstances had
not been passed.

Do antitrust laws validly apply?

MR. GRISWOLD;

Ths antitrust laws clearly apply to

newspapers and to television*

In any event, where th«ar© is a

violation of the antitrust laws, as there was in the Lorain
Journal case which came to this Court, the Department of
Justice can proseed under the-Q

MR, GRISWOLD:

Aid I am perfectly willing to concedes

that the anti competitive effect can be taken into account,,
along with all other factors in determining whether a licens®
should be granted or should be renewed.
Q

The government under the antitrust law could

validlj prevent there being only on© paper in the town where
there had been two before?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

I am not sure of that, Mr. Justice.

Suppose, that otherwise, basso, on anti trust

considerations, you would conclude that the antitrust laws
would fca violated.
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, no, I do not, Mr.. Justice.

There are many cities of this country which have only one
newspaper.
Q

I understand that.

MR. GRISWOLD:

And' I know of nothing to indicate

that th-vfc violates the autotrust law.
Q

I just pose to you though the situation where,

under ordinary antitrust principles, merger between two pro ut
would violate the antitrust laws under commonly understood
. Mtrrfc principles.

You would n.w that if that weuf -er-ie,

you could prevent the warger of the two papers without
violatiog the first amsndnwint?
MR. GRISWOLD:

7os; Mr. Justice, without violating

10

the antitrust laws.

And I know of nothing in these cases

which indicates that any of these interests has violated the
antitrust laws.
Q

I know, but then in that case the government

is saying there must be two newspaper voices in the city—MR. GRISWOLD2

Aid that is applying the same law to

newspapers that applies to every other kind of business in
the country; whereas, this rule applies only to newspapers
and applies a rule which is much more stringent.
Q

You would not say then that the antitrust laws

could validly prevent all ihe press, all the newspapers, and.
all the television stations in the city merging?
MR. GRISWOLD;

I assume that that would violate the

antitrust .laws.
Q

Even though you had

television stations as

well as newspapers?
MR,, GRISWOLD:

I thought you said all toe newspapers

•and all the television stations merging.
G

I did.

MR „ GRISWOLD:

I did.
That under many circumstances would

violate the antitrust laws , and I am not contending that the.
newspapers Ere not subject to 'the antitrust laws.

I am

contending that they cannot validly be made subject to a
blanket rule based simply on tha fact that, there is cross­
ownership

In Buckley against Valeo this Court said that—"But
the concept that government may restrict the speech of someelements of our society in order to enhance the relativa
voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment."
This is a sort of never-n-r-ar land, as Justice Stewart pointed

And this is done tc enhance the First

Q

Do you think, the Commission saw its source of

authority to require diversity in the First Amendment?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I am not sure that the Commission did

The Court of Appeals certainly did.

Court of Appeals said a presumption was compelled in order to
carry out First Amendment values.

And there is a further para­

The regulations here were intended to affect mors than

Looking on i/ at broadcasting, there will be no

there was before;.
Q

There will be just as many voices.

Has not. diversity been a factor in 'the decisions

of the Commission for 50 years?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and I am

quite clear that diversity can continue to be a factor, but
not. the controlling factor,- net the one which makes a
controlling presumption in the face of which, everything elsemust yield.
Q

The First Amendment—
When you have a half a dozen considerations,

how do you really determino which is the on® that; broke* the
camel's back?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, the closest

past experience, is the problem of the Bakke case.

involved hers.

And that, it seems to me, is what is

Diversity is an appropriate factor, but it is

not appropriate to make it the exclusive factor, which the
Court of Appeals did below,

The First Amendment is a shield,

not a sword to promote diversity.
But the Court net ad not resolve this constitutional
question.

Just as in H@lbi:ag against Griffiths, it held

that in the absence of a c Lear statement by Congress, it need
not decide whether stock dividends ara constitutionally
subject, to income tax.

And 1 may add that Congress has navor

made that decision, and stock dividends are not subject to
income® tax.

By any analysis, the prospective rule is clearly

a legislative action which can only be supported by an
adequate delegation from Congress.
It is my contention that Congress has never made any
such d@legation.
In addition to the constitutional doubt., w® have the
fact that a ban on cross-ownership is a fundamental exerciss
of gova rmental power affecting important aspects of our free
society Mid involving a substantial change in the practice eve:
th© past half century.

There is room t© argue, I think, that

14
such a fundamental change going beyond radio and television
and reaching into the printed press is on© which should be
made or authorized by representatives of the people in
Congress, and that authority t© make such a change should not
be inferred or surmised.
In our briefs we have discussed the nature of the
authorization.

All that has ever been given to the Commission

was given to it in 1934 whon it was given power over
communication by wire or radio, not power over newspapers.
And it was also given authority to grant licenses; if public
convenience, interest, or necessity will be? served thereby—
language obviously taken v-or from tha traditional public
utility statutes without any thought of newspapers.
Moreover, we have some legislative history which is
pretty good and detailed in the newspapers.

In particular, in

1952 the senate passed a statute affecting the powers of tha
Communications Commission.

The House amended that statute

with an explicit provision saying, :,Y©u do not have any power
ever newspapers»H

The exact language is quoted in tha brief.

:Cc wont to conforeo.ee.
umandme it.

Am the conference took out the House

But. the conference committee issued a report in

which it stated -that this was taken out because it was
unnecessary, that the Conedssion did not have any power ever

newspapers.
Q

ibnv viid":, weight can w® attributo to what the

15
1952 Congress thought as to what ths 1934 Congress meant?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I would suggest, Mr. Justice, that

that is not what we sr© dealing with here»
with what the 1952 Congress did.

We are dealing

The 1952 Congross—many

times committee reports have been used to establish the
intention or meaning of an act of Congress,

And in the

hierarchy of committee reports conference committees are the
very highest.

And here wa have a conference committee report

clearly dealing with this question, after which both Houses
passed the statute and ths president signed it.

And I would

suggest that that is--I agree, it is not languages in tha
statute, but it is the closest to it that you will ever find,
and it is not simply z esses of subsequent members saying,
"Well, >?© did not mean so and so back there in *S4."
Row I must turn to the grandfather question, tha
action of the Commission making its new rule inapplicable to
existing licensees except in certain small market’, situations.
The court below has held that the Commission could
net, in the court*s words, "rationally reach the conclusion
1 a favor of grandfathering. "

And it has held, apparently

bused ©a First Amendment value, that there is a, quota,
"presumption in favor of divestiture," close quote, which must

bo give, quote, "controlling weight," close quote, so that,
quota, divestiture is required except in those cases where tha
evidence! clearly discloses that cross-ownership is clearly in

16
the public interest."

And the court expressly recognised

that its pronouncement was a, quote, "court-approved policy,”
end it remanded the case to the Commission for adoption of a
rule net inconsistent with its ©pinion.
In doing this, tie court violated proper standards
of judicial review because it is not its function to tell the
Commission what rule to make.

For example, if the Commission

knew that it could not us3 the grandfathering technique in
this area, it might decide that no rule at all is preferable.
That is a matter for the Commission, not the court.»

But the

court below has decided that divestiture is required except
on an affirmative shewing of public interest.
In essence, this is the question which was decided
\

by this Court six years ago in the Democratic National Com­
mitte® case.

There the court below held that the; Commission

must make- a new rule requiring licensees to accept editorial
■advertising on the sama general ground.

This Court held that

•there was no such constitutional requirement and that courts
should not freeze the Cc

: salon's necessarily dynamic process

into a constitutional holding.
court balow has don® her©,

But this is precisely what the

It has required that a specific

rule be adopted because, in the court’s view and word?», the
First Amendment’s search for truth will b® facilitated by
governmental policy that facilitates diversity.

Thera is no

basis, E think, upon which this conclusion can be supported.

17
I am supported with respect to the grandfather
argument by counsel for the Federal Communications Commission,
and I think that I will leave most of the rest of the argument
to Mr. Armstrong.

But this court has held in the Idaho

Power case that the selection of appropriate policies in
carrying out its statutes is an administrative and not a
judicial decision.
And in the Board jaf Trad® against the United States
a good many years ages, the Court said, "We certainly have
neither technical competens© nor legal authority to pronounce
upon the wisdom of the course taken by the Commission.”
There are two remaining issues to which 1 can give
only brief consideration.

In its final order, the Commission

listed 16 situations to which it did not apply the grandfather
rule.

These are seven casas where there was co-ownership cf

fch® only newspaper and the only television station in. the
community even if there were radio stations in the community.
There were also nine situations where there was a single
-icwspar. sr and & single: radio station or a combination of
AM/FM radio stations.
egregious cases.

Then© situations have been called

But I think that is too pejorative.

may too;:® accurately be called small market cases.

They

Tha Court

of Appeals sat aside this portion of the Commission’s decision,
■end in this raspect fch© court’s decision should be sustained ■
Tha Court of App<als is correct in holding that,

1C
quote, "The record contained no evidence that justified the
disparate treatment of the 16 affected combinations."

And

the Commission itself said that the rules are not in the
least premised on the existence of improprieties in the
operation of the media holdings.
Q

Counsel, if we are talking about rules, why

does fc] ere need to be any reference to a record?

The

Commission c&n make a ru3@ without having any record before
it, cax it not?
MR. GRISWOLD:

That certainly is a nice question.

I would suggest that a rule which is applicable to only 16
instances out of hundreds is not really a rule but necessarily
involves what amounts to an adjudication with respect to those
16 insiances.

For ©sample, in some of these cases, there is

cable television.

in one of the cases, where there is a

newspaper and a television station, there are seven radio
stations in addition, separately owned in the community.

And

all of those things, it seems to me, should be taken into
account..

This question of the small market cases is dealt

with more fully in the red covered brief.
Finally, 1 would say that this dog has a very small
tail.

There are a few situations of cross-ownership of a

newspaper and radio station where there are other broadcasters,
television ©r radio, in the seme community..

These were not

covered by fell© Commission's order because -of the grandfather

19
clause

However , should the Court, uphold the Court of Appeals

in saying that, the grandfather clause is invalid,, then they
would be swept in.

But fcha position is made in the blue and

th@ green brief that radio is different from television, that,
there should b© separate considerations of the question
whether the rule should apply to radio where there is only
radio and television and tiers are other voices in the com­
munity.

And my position is that care should be taken to see

that these newspaper-radio combinations are not just caught
up in the draft and carried away.
Our basic contention is that the Commission had no
authority to make any rules in this area either for consti­
tutional or statutory reasons, but that if it did have such
authority, it did have power to make the grandfather provision.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Armstrong.

ORAL ARGUMENT CF DANIEL M. ARMSTRONG, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER AND RESPONDENT
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
MR. ARMSTRONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it plaas<v

the Court:
The Commission's fundamental position in these
consolidated cases is, first, that our prospectivo rule is
a ratic.sc. 1 exercise

of our rule-making authority grounded in

the public interest standard of fcha 1934 statute; and,
secondly, that, our refusal to apply the new policy against

20

additional co-located newspaper“breadcast combinations to
existing combinations , except in certain of the small market
cases? is rational and was adequately explained in the second
report and order.
On the first contention and at the outset? I believe,
th© question came up as to whether the Commission felt that
the Fir at Amendment was tha

source of the prospective rule.

I will concede that l think the Court may find soma language
in th® Commission's second report and order in which tha
Commission said that what we are doing her© is consistent with
the. objective of the First Amendment? to encourage a number
of speakers.

But I would not stand on the First Amendment

constitutionally compelling the Commission to have adopted the
prospective rule.
Q

Or authorize it?

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Or even--well, I think,. Mr. Justice

White? that it is ruth oris-2d by the public interest standard
in the Communications Act.
Q

Which is what? interstate commerce?

It has an

interstate commerce basis?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

'.it is the standard that? among

other considerations ? tha Commission can take into account in
allocating spectrum resources

is a policy of diversity.

And

that is one component of th® public interest.
Q

And that is based on Congress's authority over

21
interstate commerce?
MR. ARMSTRONG;
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And not on the First. Amendment.

MR. ARMSTRONG;

Not the First Amendment, yes, sir.

I understand your question.
In applying that diversity component of the public
interest standard, the ccurts—both the Court of Appeals and
this Court’s dictum in the 1959 RCA case—have long recognised,
and Dean Griswold conceded this, that one of the relevant
factors th® Commission can take into account in deciding how
to allocate spectrum resources is whether the applicant before
it has ownership interest not only in other broadcast stations
but also in newspapers.

S3-—and I believe, Mr. Chief Justice,

you may have alluded to this—as we view this caa®, the real
question in this case raised by the prospective rule is not
a First Amendment question.

It is whether th® Commission has

rations Xly, in applying th® public interest standard of the
act, re ached the position where it is ready to announce that
this oas c@l3ve.at factor is now going to he determined.
I might cay it is not determined in an exceptional
case which might warrant a waiver of th© rule.

But for purposm

of argument, since that is admittedly an exceptional case, vr-a
will proceed on the resumption that we have said it is going
to to© determined.

And the Commission would respectfully

•riodt that that is net a ,iss3 of first impre:;d.cvr before

22
this Court because prior to the adoption of the multiple
ownership rules that were before the Court in the Storer
Broadcasting case in 1956, if an applicant owned seven AM
radio stations, for example, and was applying to the Commis­
sion for an eighth AM radio station.

Presumably it would

have bean recognized that in applying the diversity policy
and in passing on that application the Commission could
certainly take into account the fact that the applicant
already owned seven AM stations»

But the argument prior to

this Court's decision in Storer, which the Court of Appeals
in the Storer case had accsptad, was that the Co:erica
could rot make that one fact determinative and would instead
bo able to deny-that application only after a full hearing in
which „t.ha applicant, -could submit all of the So-called other
relevant factors the c-pplicant wished to consider.
Q

How much v,eight could the Commission give if

an applicant had only four television stations but their
market area came into play?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

I believe I understand, Mr. Chief

■'fundee, that your qurstios is suppose the Commission was

to charge the prassrst - ulo, which says there is a limit of
five v; F stations, to try t> change it. to four.

If the

CeuTmisi- ion were to do that, I think we would argue that; kind
of line-Q

What I had in mind was four stations in Wm

23
York City, Newark, Trenton, and Philadelphia, something like
that»
MR. ARMSTRONG:

I think the closer the location, the

easier a job the Commission would have in convincing the Court,
that its public interest judgment was rational.

Anyway, you are going to argue the constitu­

MR. ARMSTRONG:

All right.

MR. ARMSTRONG:

if wq are acting without our

statutory authority—and in a moment I would like, to discuss
Dean Griswold's reference "x» the '32 legislation--but if it is
within our general rule-making authority under the '34 act
and if the public interest judgment is rationally explained
and if that leads us to a decision to deny an applicant a
.license, it is our position that that applicant has not had
his First Amendment rights violated anymore than the applicant
for fch© eighth AM radio station would not hav& his constitu­
tional rights violated if, in applying that, rule that was
upheld in storey, we turned his application down.
As to 'the point cf vha statutory authority and t v:

MR. ARMSTRONG:

But that is the impact of what, the Commission

did.
MR, ARMSTRONG:

'li® ultimate bottom line in the case,

as- we v.$.v. it, la whether spectrum resources have to be given

And we would say that this Court in the

dictum in the 1959 cese aid the Court of Appeals in the

pap

b-i6 Clarksburg r^iass have recognized that the

26
status of an applicant, as the owner of a newspaper is
relevant for the Commission to consider in deciding whether
to give that applicant, a broadcast station.
So, we do net—a3 I tried to say at the beginning—
think that there is any new First Amendment issue because of
the newspaper status of the applicant injected into this
case.

It is really just a question of whether the Commission

has now reached a point in the application ©f its licensing
experience—to put the point differently, suppose the Cornmiss ion had not adopted this rule, and w© had gone through the
formalities of the process that Dean Griswold has urged that
we should go through case by case for the next 30 years—and it
just so happened that when this Court reviewed what had
happened after the next 30 years, you would find that .in rvery
single case the Commission said, "In applying our cumulative
insight, and experience, we reached a judgment that the relevent
factor of the applicant*s newspaper ownership is now going to
be determinative; application denied "—really that would be
no different a situation than the situation we have now.

rhe

only difference is the Commission has announced in advance
thr.t its attitude is such as if there would be a denial.
Q

But you did single out newspapers.

MR, ARMSTRONG:
Q

Mr. Justice Marshall—

X mean,- for example, supposing the ownsr can

grillas, the Chase National Bank, and it is okay.
MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q

Mr. Justice Marshall—

But a newspaper, no.

MR. ARMSTRONGs

Mxcuse me, sir.

You are quite

correct in your statement of what has happened.

Our answer

would ba that the Commission is evanh&ndedly and rationally
applying a relevant public interest policy of diversity.

And

I would have to concede to you that by its very nature that
is the kind-of policy which will have more bite

as far as a

newspaper or another broadcast station is concerned than as
far as the owner of AMTRAR is concerned.

Thera is no ques­

tion about that, that by its very nature the policy is going
to hurt a newspaper uppliciiat's chances more than it will
hurt the owner of AMTRAK's chances if he wants to get a licens a.
Q

But than it Is just not neutra3 at all.

You

are not neutral, srs you?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

I think that the policy of—if it

could bo characterised as that, it nevertheless is not a
grounds for striking down what we have done because the
diversity policy, it. would seem to ne by the tenor of your
question, would fall; and that has been recognized.
Q

I still do not see where you get jurisdiction

over the newspaper owner.
MR. ARMSTRONG:
newspaper owner.

We do not have jurisdiction over the

28
owner only when ths newspaper owner comes to the Commission
and asks for & license, which is what w© do have jurisdiction

overf the allocation of a radio license.
Q

But3 I mean, do they have to set out all these

other things?
MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q

Excuse me, six"?

Does the owner, the proposed owner, does he

have to set out everything else he owns?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

I do not want to get drawn into a

detailed discussion of the Commission's ownership reporting
requirements, but I think m do .require and are moving
increasingly to acquire in pressing annual reports? about other
ownership interests they may have.

And certainly we could

tell from an. applicant, being before us I think whether or not
the applicant was a newspaper owner or the owner of AMTRAK.
Q

This is aimed at newspapers.

MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q

Mo, sir, it is—

I do not understand how you can get away from

it.
MR. ARMSTRONG:

”h© actual wording of this regula­

tion, yes, sir, it is, on its face it is.

And does taut not violate the specific

provision of that committ<ie report?

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Oh„ good.

Before you get to that. w@

have said I think

on a number of occasions her©—and other courts have said it—
that the First Amendment is not confined to newspapers or

It belongs to everyone.

cast license available and one of the bidders was* AMTRAK and

Would

not the inquiry give great weight to the newspaper's experi­
ence in journalism as distinguished from AMTRAK’s lack of
experience in that field?
MR., ARMSTRONG:

As I understand it, you

are saying

in that case his newspaper owra .-shi> would actually work in
his favor,

B-seaure it r-hows their experience.

■
And

how the mix would corns cut—
Q

This was only one newspaper.

MR. A.RMSTRONG;
Q

—on an individual case—•

A newspaper that had no other stations and no

other—
MR. ARMSTRONG i

l nder those circumstances, it is

quits conceivable that thu weight in favor of the ©xpuric-nc-3

30

factor that you mention would outweigh whatever demerit the
applicent would suffer under the diversity criterion.
On the statutory authority point we have two
arguments.

The first one fas suggested by Mr. Justice

Relinquish, and that is we think for the reasons that 1 have
gone through that the *34 act, the public interest, rule­
making standard authority given to the Commission in Section
303, as: interpreted by this Court in Storey, is sufficient to
answer the case and that tie Court should not give much, if
any, weight to the subsequent legislative history that was
relied on by Dean Griswold.

But if the Court is disposed to

take into account subsegue it legislative history,, we call
the Court*s attention to tie ’74 statute.

In *52, as was

recognised in the argument, neither House actually—well, the
House of representatives hid, but in the final analysis it
was just a. conference committe® report and there was no
legible feiosi.

But in *74 tie Congress was fully fiware of fcha

Ccnmiseion*s outstanding rule-making proceeding, which is now
before this Court.

They followed it closely, and there was

interchange between the Co-’mission and the Congress concerning
the ©volution of that procedure.

And each House went; on

record with a legislative sill in 1974 which,w© would
respectfully submit, eimply is inconsistent with the notion
that. Congress in 1952 had denied our authority in this area.
The House - of Representatives said, "Whatever :lt is you are

31
going to do in your outstanding proceeding on the* basis of
newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership, do it in a rule-making
proceeding and also finish that rule-making proceeding by a
date

certain."
The Senate took out th® first provision but also

passed a provision saying, "In this outstanding proceeding
you have got proposing a rale to ban future newspaper-broadcast
cross-ownership, finish it by a certain date."

Mid all the

two Hot.so3, the different versions, were not reconciled and

no legislation ever emerged, we do think that the '74 history
would remove any possible conclusion that in. 1952 our general
rule-making authority had ;>aen cut down.
To turn to cur case before this Court as a petitioner t
it is oar argument that tho distinction between the prospec­
tive and retroactive rules is a rational on® and was adequately
®rple.lvad in our opinion.

In the case of the prospective rule,

th® Cor.uission, admittedly operating on the presumption that
it was tore realistic to asqpect true diversity if you did not

have ctnanon ownership, da aided to give that consideration
deterinlur.tiv# weight, .:.vc i though v® recognized—‘and tha
c-iurts all rscognisad this*—that tear3 was no guaranty thatth® mor s diverse viewprants would result if we did not have
separati ownership.

But -it-.® Commission said under these

circumstances, the prospectivo rula where you are not talking
about other countervai Xing considerations, we think tha one

32
reason we once had for allowing that is no longer d@termi*iative
In other words, we can have approval of other people coming
forward»

Wa no longer have to rely upon a newspaper owner to

get service started,

And so under those circumstances, even

though the gain in diversity may be slight, it may be only
hoped for in a great many cases ? nevertheless, where there is
no rea;

cost on the other side of the balance wheel, we are

going to give it determinative weight.»
Q

What happens if a newspaper in Baltimore wants

to buy a radio-television station in Washington?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

If—it would depend on the contour

of the radio station in Washington whether or not it would
place c, certain contour over the City of Baltimore.

I do not

think it is by any means campelied from this rule that it
could not be dons.
very c:ear.

In f&cs, a new—let us make this point

This is not a total ban against new newspaper

owners coming into broadcasting.

Just fees take an easier case,

if it is Richmond, Virginia, then for sure the Baltimore
newspaper would be able to be eligible to apply for a. radio
statior in Richmond.
Q

That, is- why I did not pick Richmond.

MR. ARMSTRONG:

[Laughter!

lou picked a case that would require;

■some 6abailed applicat.ion of the standards of the rule, and L
would not know right offhard how it might coma out.
Q

Thst is through the city signal or some such

33
thing os that.
MR. ARMSTRONGS

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, a specified

signal for the whole community of Baltimore.

Yes, sir.

The other considerations that were present in the
case of a retroactive rule which did not in our judgment
outweigh the presumed gain in diversity that would have
resulted from applying th© rule across the board were, first.,
that a broader divestiture rule of the sort that was advocated
by the respondent National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting
would have swept out proven licensees with long records of
meritorious service.

The Commission pointed out, I think it

was, in paragraph 109 of the Second Report and Order that
these licensees, many of them, had been there from th® tix-2
the station was first, established, and there was a study In
the record that has not been disputed by, 1 bolls ve,
Mr. Robbins, saying that fcho particular newspaper licensees
hud she ,-m by their action n much greater long-term commitment
t'i broadcasting- than had noon true with others-,

So, the

Corudas ion was confronted with the fact that it was going to
have to gat rid of a class of licensees who included licensees
with-Q

Mr. Armstrong, how many of the members of the

class that are preserved by the grandfather clause fit that
definition?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

Kx. Justice Stevens, every member of

34
that class, it can be said of that member that its record has
been before the Commission—at ©very three years at renewal
time—Las been passsed upon by the Commission and has bearfound to b© in 'tii© public interest.

And the Commission

characterized, generally 3peaking, the record of the class as
a group as meritorious—
Q

And your argument is not that it. includes some

especially well-qualified stations but that everyone in the
class has proven his entitlement to a continued license?
MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q

:«ell, it is true that—

I guess; that is true; about ©very licensee in

the country, is it nest?
MR. ARMSTRONG:
0

IBS, sir.

with one cr two exceptions, every licensee has

had his license three years or more.
MR. ARMSTRONG:

lea, sir.

In the case of fchss©

though it has been pat-seel lpon by the Commission at threeyear irtervals and is found to have been serving the public
interest.
Q

That is true about every licensee in the coun­

try with one or two notable exceptions.
MR. Armstrong:

L think in 'the case of these licensees

generally speaking, Mr. Justice Stewart, they have been in
there longer.

As I said sirlier, a lot of them have been in

there fine© the beginning.

So, there has been much longer

35
continuity of service in their case than is the case with a lot
of other licensees

,

although it is true that the great value

which <iia Commission places on continuity of service has
clearly been evidenced by the manner in which the Commission
has disposed of renewal applications.

And nothing I might

say in our efforts to preserve our grandfather rule in this
case ii intended to immunise any license® from continuing to
have to pass the Commission's scrutiny ©very 'three years end
to be judged on their performance.
Q

Was diversity involved in each one; of these

renewals?
MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q

" asr* not sure.

1 think most of us have familiarity with

renewals and applications; and sometimes renewals are almost
perfunctory.
MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q

Are they not?

all it dees.

That is

And in addition to our justification, which wa

think was rationally explained in our right to sey that

continuity outweighs a presumed gain- in diversity, we also

rely on the doctrine that this result of grandfathering is so

37
clearly rational in terms of our legal system's bias against
retroactive applications and new policies that it really did
not require a great deal of explanation, and it is consistent
with what the Commission’s licensing policy has been over the
years.

It is consistent with what we have don® in past

instances when w® have adopted rules that are designed to
further diversity by limiting multiple ownership, almost
without; exception.
Q

Is it inconceivable that after five years

experience or any number of years you want to pick, the
Commission might com© to substantially the same conclusion
that the Court of Appeals- came to now in © rule-making
proceeding?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

it is conceivable, Mr. Chief

Justice, that;-Q

On the basis of experience.

weight to diversity than, is felt it was able to do on the
basis if the record in this proceeding because tills record did
cot establish a strong shewing, and the Commission relied on
that heavily.

And clearly intervening'experience might changes

the nature of the record.

That, was a. very important part of

the Commission's balancing process.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE# ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am here representing the United States, which is
a statutory party in these proceedings—I laughter'j—and
probably would have a right to intervene because the
constitutionality of &n act: of Congress as applied has been

43
challenged.

However, there Is no need to exercise such a

right, in this case.
Q

Under section—

Mr. Wallace, are you not ordinarily expected

to upheld the act of Congrass that is challenged under that
section?
MR. WALLACEt

We ar© not attacking

the constitu­

tionali ty ©f any act ©f Congress in our submission to this
Court.
Q

But 1 thought you said that was one of the

authorities by which you were hare.
MR. WALLACE:

We could have—wall, vra did not have,

to sask to intervene for that purpose.

We ar<i a statutory

party.
Under Section 307 of the Communications Act, the
Federal Communications Commission is to grant application for
broadcast licenses if the public convenience, interest, or
necessity will be served thereby.

And for more than 30 years

in both rule-making and licensing proceedings the. Commission
.pas recognized that this standard requires it to take into
•account in issuing licens su the interests of the public in
diversity of ownership of the media of communication.

Among

the factors that it has historically considered for this
purpose in comparative proceedings over the years has been
an applicant’s ownership of a daily newspaper in the locality
to b© served by the broadcasting license.

In this respect, fch®

44
CommisL- ion is charged not. to be; neutral but to make an inquiry
as to what will serve the public interest under ths statutory
standard.

And one of the components of the public interest is

divers!ty of ownership of the media of communications and
divergent voices to be heard.
The present rule before this Court is an effort to
deal, w: th th© newspaper broadcast co-ownership question in a
more systematic way.

This is not a rule that disqualifies

newspaper owners from being licensees of broadcast stations.
Th© rule applies only to uj-ownership of a newspaper and a
broadcast facility in th® gam© community.

Newspaper owners

are not disqualified under this rule from ownership of breadcast stations, from licensing broadcast stations—no

one owns

fcha particular airways—bu&t from being licensees of broad­
cast stations in other communities*
distinction to keep ir. mini hers.

And that is an important
It is illustrated very well

by the recent exchange between the Detroit News and the
Washington Post television stations in those two cities,
which will result in dissolution of two of the’co-ownership

situations that were before the Commission when it was
aside ring this rule by a»*ans of the kind of Swapping that

the Commission anticip ated could occur without in any way
making newspaper c-eaass as such ineligible. to be licensees of
broadprsting stations.

Bui by applying the public interest

Increas’d or at least protect against diminishing the
diversity of voices to be heard in that community, based on
a finding of the Commission* based on its experience and
much ©••• ddence that was before it, the public looks primarily
to these two sources, to its daily newspapers and its local
broadcasting stations and particularly its local television
stations, for its news and for its information on public
affairs.

And this is accentuated with respect to local news

affairs.
The handling of

'Ais matter.by the adoption of a

rule rather than case by case, as it has been handled over the

The Commission was concerned with protecting

licensees against this result by providing a means whereby
they would have

a reasonable period to swap stations or

otherwise t© realise the market, value of their licenses, all
with a view toward what the Commission has ©vtsr the years

The Commisaion undertook to protect this interest
by proceeding in a rule-making proceeding rather than merely
apply in j from cane bo ease the new insights arid the further
insights that it has developed into the problem cf concentra­
tion of ownership of the modia and the problems that it has
prissntEc- that have come to its

attention ©vex the years.

And it further sought to protect these interests by specifying
thtt it would certify transfers that resulted from the
divestiture provisions that, it would adopt and it did adopt
from, ®3 the Court has bean informed, for favorable tax
treatment under Section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code in
order to further protect those interests because the transfers

provision was also adopted under which claims of particular
hardship could be heard with a view toward possibly extending
the tin© in individual casas and the like.
So, the rule that has bean adopted in so far as it
applies prospectively seems to us to be a valid imd reasonable
way to apply the public interest standard that the Commission
long has been applying under the act, based on the commerce
power of Congress.

In

*

that r< £,pi..

we disagree with the Court of Appeals•

We think

the Commission did have authority, based on the considerations
that were before it, ho recognize that especially severe

problems existed in ocrranun .ties in which there wore, for
example, only on© daily newspaper end one television station
whore ther© would to a mutual inhibition on cross-criticism
bc.tweer the two major medi i in the community, which in itself
v: vdd leave the community without any independent voice to
criticise the impact that those media have on the community
and thv effect on its affairs.

We think that this is an

egregious consideration that the Commission properly did
recognise.

Ws disagree with the Court of Appeals thet thsre

wre no rational bests for singling out those particular
axaiBplCiS.

48
We do not, believe, however, that the grandfathering
that tr © Commission has adopted with respect to the other
existis g cross-ownerships was rationally justified by the
consideration that the Commission itself chose to rely on.

On

•the Con mission? s oxen terms, we do not think the lines that it
has drswn, the basic differentiation it has intreduced, between
the existing cross-ownerships and the future license questions,
including transfers, has been rationally justified,,

And before

turning to th® reasons why the Commission's justifications do
not stand up, it is important I think t© recognize that very
imports at interests are ab stake here in what the: Commission
has decided.

There is not only the public interests that this

Court has recognized in the; Associated Press case and in other
ostes dealing with th© Picat Amendment aspects of regulation in
the area of news media—the public interests in th® widest
possible dissemination of information from diverse and
antagonistic sources, as it was put there—but there were a
aumber af examples before th© Commission of disadvantages
flowing from cross-ownership or safeguards from having an
. dtjpenSenfc vole© to which th® Commission was surely entitled
to give way.
Without going into great detail about them, examples
wars cited to the Commission, a joint operating agreement
being—
Q

Mr. Wallace, 'may I interrupt you for a moment?

49
You ara now arguing against the Commissiones grandfathering
provis: .on?
MR. WALLACE;
Q

Yes.

And you are saying that there were examples

before it to which it was: entitled to give weight.
MR. WALLACE;
Q

That is correct.

That does not make sense to me.

It seems to me

you have to make a stronger case than that.
MR. WALLACE;

I am about to.

I am using this as an

introduction to the deficiencies because I think it is
importsnt tc recognize; what was at stake before the Commission.
Q

If it was entitled to give weight,, it was

entitled .not to give weight,
MR. WALLACE;

It obviously gave some weight to these,

or it would not have adopted the prospective rule and order the
divestitures that it did.

One of the constraints upon an

administrativa agency is consistency in its treatment of
p SL

s

subject to its jurisdiction, Mr. Justice, and

1' at is one of the problem:» with which we are presented here.
and 1 want to highlight that in just a moment.
Q

But the consistency concept does rot prevent a

regulatory agency from having a change of mind or heart over
a perled of time, does it?
MR. WALLACE:
Q

Not at all.

Such as the Internal Revenue Service.

50
MR. WALLACE:

But it doss have to bas© the way it

applies that change on rational grounds that do not treat
individuals arbitrarily, based on factors that are unrelated
rationally to tie basis on which the agency has changed its
positicn.
I want to just mention one or two examples that ware
before the Commission and to which it obviously gave soma
weight in adopting the prospective rule of the divestiture
requirement that it did.

One was an example of joint operating

agreements that were the subject of negotiation between the
daily newspapers in a city and which were being opposed by labor
unions and others in the community and where allegations were
made that the. television station owned by one of those news­
papers presented no news concerning those agreements and
negotiation until they ware consummated, and that, to have done
uo would have been against the economic interests of the news­
paper that owned the television station.
Another example was editorial support in the local
newspapers for a particular location for a museum to be built
in the

city, which location was close tso where the newspapers

were being published, where* then© is considerable sentiment tor
the mus *um to fca located elsewhere, which was brought out. onlyin &n independently operated television station in that
communiry and was not allegedly covered in the particular
papers

Involved there.

51
These are examples, and the idea is not; whether the
particular examples were accurate, but they were the kinds of
dangers 'that the Commission had before it and obviously had
in mine

in its concern about cross-ownerships here.
The other factor to keep in mind is that the prospec­

tive rv1© that the Commission did adopt dees have an effect on
existing combinations.

This is not a

bright line between a

prospective rule and a retrospective rule.

It has an effect on

existing combinations by a process of gradual attrition of
existing cross-ownerships at the time they arcs transferred for
value.

For example, when the Washington Star in this city was .

sold within recent years, the transfer policy was applied to
it, and the co-owned television station could not be trans­
ferred to the same owner.

The result was a dissclution cf that:

ownership where the competitive daily newspaper, the

:

i
Post, was allowed to continue to have its locally owned co­
located , commonly owned television station.

This introduces a

disparity between newspapers in the same community, which is

ji
a serious matter.

I do not say that it is an unconstitutional

disparitythat it is not something that Congress could have
adopted, but. it is a disparity in treatment in a constitution- i
i

ally so isitiv© -area which impels us to take a careful look at
the reasons given by the Commission—
0

That disparity would bs fully correctable within

a maximam of three years if the Commission thought that that

]•

52
disparity was a controlling reason for not granting a renewal
of the application.
MR. WALLACE:
Q

It could be—

it would not be a permanent disparity in any—

MR. WALLACE:

—but the Commission felt considerable

inhibition at renewal time to engage in what it considers to
be a forfeiture of the applicant's license when the applicant
is providing his service.
Q
compelled

Your argument now is that the Commission was
not to have a grandfather clause?

MR. WALLACE:

There sirs particularly strong reasons

to see whether the Commission's grandfather clause was
ration lly based, whether the grounds that it gave for
adopting the grandfather clause stand up on the Commission's
own premises.

That in all I a», arguing, not that the Commission

was ccsr .pelled to have a grandfether clause.
Q

If it had this prospective rule, it was com-

pelled to have a grandfather clause.

That is what I thought

your argument was.
MR. WALLACE:
Q

Am I mistaken?

We are arguing several points in

One is that the Commission has not

weight to local ownership a-s such.

How can you

say

that it is irrational to

assume that it might take place?
MR. WALLACE;
"j

The Commission has approved many

transfers over -the years which resulted in diminution of local
ownership, as I expect, they will approve the Washington™
Detroit transfer.

And there was no evidence before the

ComaiisE loner that local ownership—that there wares not eligible
local cnars to come forward to be transferees of these

55

licenses if the Commission were to require that they be
transferred to locally-owned interests or if the Commission
wanted to give particular weight to that fact.

The Commission

certainly did not give any weight to a requirement that local
owners bs found in the instances in which it was requiring
divestJtur©.
Q

You do not- need any sort of evidence in a rule-

making proceeding, do you?
MR. WALLACE:

No, but you need a rational ground

for belief that what you are worried about will be diminished
by the particular course of action.
)

Q

Is not the Commission presumed to have seme

compete nos and expertise which can. supply that rational ground
unless

-it

is just patently fallacious?

MR. WALLACE:

It does have some expertise in this

area, hat there is nothing on the face of either Commission
practice or

the Commission purported to rely on or what

was bef or© it- to indicate that local ownership would be
preserved by the grandfathering or was of sufficient concern to
the Commission that they were taking any steps to assure
j

transfers to local owners where they were requiring divesti­
ture.

In other wordst as we said in our brief, fJiat particular

■element was

a makeway.

I think Mr. Firestone will deal with

the other grounds relied upon by the Commission and why we do
not think they rationally justify the order that is adopted.

56
And I io believe the Court: should, keep in mind that in 1943
at the time the Commission adopted the rule against ©©-located
AH stations, it did not grandfather; it did not introduce the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. FIRESTONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF 0!! RESPONDENT NATIONAL
CITIZENS'COMMITTEE FOR BROADCASTING
MR. FIRESTONE;

Yss, sir, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
I am Charles Firestone from the National Citizens

i

Committee for Broadcasting., which of course seeks affirmance of
the Court's decision.

I have three points I want to make, and

during the course of that time, I do hope to address that point
First, I would like to follow through on the
Solicitor General's arguments about

?hy it was arbitrary and

57

capricious and to answer Mr. Justice Relinquish’s question about
tiie need for a record»

The point is here I think that the

Congress ordered 'the agencies, under the Administrative
Procedure Act, not to be arbitrary and capricious, and that is
really the basis of this court reversal, that simply the
Commis,' ion was arbitrary and capricious in the way that, they
treat©:, the various issues before them.
Q

That is quite different from saying it is not

supported by substantial evidence.
MR. FIRESTONE;
Q

Yes.

A rule can survive tbs arbitrary “-and-capricious

test wi thout an iota of evidence having been introduced for
the Con mission, may it. not?
MR. FIRESTONE:

'3b believe that if there is absolutely

no record support and no basis for coming to suppositions, that
it could rise to a level of being arbitrary and capricious.
Q

Is it r-wt difficult to find arbitrary and

capricious on a five-year period of time?
MR. FIRESTONE:

Your Honor, the place where it was

arbitrary and capricious m-.s the Commission's failure to order
divestiture.

It is a failure to apply its prospective rule.

MR. FIRESTONE;

The five-year standard is not what

we say is arbitrary and capricious.

What happened here is that

practices and which are inconsistent with the Communications
Act.
A second point I hops to make in my argument is the

«insuring that there is a free flow of information, the public's
right to know, it derives from but not just the First Amendintot.

It also derives from Section 303(g) of the ConBaunicatic-ns

Act, which is at page A-29 of th® Joint Appendix, where it

saysi

Congress mandated the Commission to promote the effective—the
larger and more effective us® of radio.

The Court in NBC said

60

that this included a concern about monopolization of th® media.
But the Commission did come out. with a standard.

They said that

it is i nrealistic to expect true diversity from newspaperbroadcast station combinations.

And, therefore, in looking

only to the broadcasting stations—and they are not trying to
regular © newspapers—-they treat newspapers the same as they
treat television stations to the extent that you cannot own two
television stations ir the same market.

And they look to the

equality, more or less, in terms of where people get most of
their news and information.
But when it cams time to apply this to renewal, the
Coramisoion--«yen

though tiara is a three-year limit on a

rsaewe) ost by Congress and even though the Communications Act
requires them to or mandates them to have a larger and mors
of feet:' vo use of radio—-the Commission moved to immunize
existir.g licensses from, structural challenge on the basis of
cencsniration of control.

And on these three points that, the

C Fimis*.ion rs-t to o-r.rriti this strong factor of diversity,
the Commission itself has said that diversity is the primary
licensing factor.

And yet they looked to these three over­

riding factors, to this diversity criterion.
And the first, Mr. Justice Stevens, with regard to
local ownership, the first thing that the Commission did was
ban local ownership ir the prospective rule.

If a 1ccal

newspaper wants to acquire a local television station, they

61
cannot do it.

The factor of diversity overrode.

Secondly—
Q

That did net bar local ownership.

That just

barred local ownership by a newspaper.
MR. FIRESTONE:

Right.

But. certainly here what it

showed is that they preferred the criterion of diversity over
local ownership for the prospective rule but turned around and
used this criterion to override diversity for existing
licensees when 25 percent of them were not even local ownex-s.
Secondly; the Commission only looks to local
ownership traditionally « ndnd in the 1965 policy statement on
renewal s.

They only looked at to the extent that there is

integrotion of ownership into management.

And here the

broadc stars claim thcit the newspaper owners were not. integrated

Q

Does not the Coir miss ion’s reliance here supersede

MR. FIRESTONE:

Except that they have not disavowed—

they heve not—perhaps, they could supersede it, but they did
not do it here.

They did not really explain what they were

doing here.

Q

They just

And it just goes to the arbitrariness of

decision here.

Mr. Firestone, I know the newspapers argued

that they were not involved in the management of stations much.
Did the Commission so find?

The. Commission stated that were it not

far many mere divestitures.

They did not actually make a

finding that—they did not look into it anymore.

They basically

relied on these representations<
Q '

Are you saying it would be irrational to attach

any weight at all to the requirement of local ownership unless

the loc. 1 ow.ior were actively involved in management?
MR. FIRESTONE?

Under existing Commission law, unless

the Commission had changed it—
Q

Lot us follow Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s suggestion.

Maybe all the past Commission law has been irrational.

The

63
question is whether this particular ruling was rational, is it
not?

And would it be irrational for the Commission to attach

some Widght to a factor of local ownership, even though the
local owner were not actively involved in management?

Is that

not the question?
MR, FIRESTONE:

I do not think it is the question,

but if it wore—

explair any reason for that.

But they did not

And they just mentioned it.

In

fact, in this case they actually purported to be following past
policy.

They alluded to the 1965 policy statement.

And I do

not think it was their intention to retreat from that integra­
tion of ownership into management factor.

64
Second, the issue of local economic dislocations was
another example.
Q

First of all—

Let mo just ask one other question, Mr. Firestone.

On remand, I taka it, it would not be open to the Commission to
rewrite its opinion entirely and say we reviewed the entire
matter from a new angle; we overruled a lot of prior decisions;
we now conclude upon fresh review that the grandfather clause is
proper and the prospective ruls was proper, both.

Could they

write £ better opinion, and still sustain that rule under the
Court of Appeals mandate?
MR. FIRESTONE;

Under the Court of Appeals mandate

they—the quick answer to your question is I do think the
Commission could rewrite the opinion and—
Q

And reach the same result?

MR. FIRESTONE:
very herd to determine.
Q

—and reach the same result.

It is

I cannot really determine that.

If you assume they could have written a better

opinion and reached the same result, you must be assuming it. is
not totally irrational.
MR. FIRESTONE;

Right.

I think that: that is the

Chsnsry idea-"
Q

is not -the Chenary .remand—it is not a remand

that to say go ahead and restate your reasons» ycu reasons do
not. adequately support the conclusion.

As I understand it, the

remand is to carry out the direction of the. Court of Appeals as

65
to what the rule should be.
MR. FIRESTONE:

We do not read that decision.

We

read the decision,- for instance, in footnote 53 to contemplate
that there might be a totally different rule, totally different
even prospective ruls , in terms of

a

30 percent criterion,

as was suggested by some people, including some of the parties
here.
But getting on to the local economic dislocation
criterion, the Commission says, "We are afraid that”—in fact,
they do not. make it clear.

Again, we are not sure what they

said except that counsel explains that they say that they are
concerned about reinvestment, of having enough money through
increased interest rate.

They ware concerned that interest

rates vould increase if there was a widespread divestiture,
and they were concerned that there would be enough money to
invest

in the programming.

And yet the Commission specifically

has refused to look at: this question in licensing cases.

And

the Alt ansa case which we cite is an example where the Court of
Appeals has affirmed the Commission's refusal to look into
this criterion in the public interest.

Wow they are using that

criterion to override their strong interest in diversity of
communi cations sources.

Similarly with continuity of ownership.

Anf; the to of course tha licensaa just. minimally served the pub­
lic interest over the years.

The C«imission did not. really and rationally deal with that.

media, of promoting diversification.

Yet what it has done is

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Mr. Griswold, you had some

observations right at the: outset of your argument about the
unconstitutional!ty of saying e newspaper cannot have the same
rights as anyone also,

How would you apply that proposition

to what I haves just bean discussing with Mr. Firestone on the
Star?

The Federal Communications Commission, it appears, said

to the Star, the new owners of the Star, "You cannot have this
television station.”

Under your theory, as you outlined it at

the outset that would be unconstitutional, would it not?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF ALL PRIVATE PETITIONERS
MR. GRISWOLD;

If dons by a blanket rule which pre­

vents the consideration of all of the facts and circumstances
with respect to that particular case.
Q

It was a blanket rule.

MR. GRISWOLD:

In this case, it is a blanket rule.

In'the Star case.

When the new owner bought the Star —

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Oh, the Washington Star.

—and WMAL together.

MR. GRISWOLD:

That of course, as far as I know, is

the only case or at least the only prominent case which
actually exists under this rule.

And I think it shows, among

other things, that -tills rule doss not promote diversity.

What

has happened by taking the ownership by newspaper into account
in a particular case with respect to the Boston Herald has been
to destroy the Boston Herald.

And what may happen-with respect

to the rule as applied fee the Washington Star may be to destroy
the Washington.Star.

And my contention is that the Commission

not only has no authority under its existing statute to make
a rule applicable only to newspapers but that it may well be
unconstitutional in doing so.

And in particular in dealing

with the final case to which Mr. Firestone referred, I would
like te suggest that there is nothing about, that in the record
of this ease.

And if the Commission was in error in that case,

it should ceme up in that ease on that record.
Q

Are you suggesting that constitution.?*!Jy the

prospective rule might; survive but the divestiture rule might

But could you

MR. GRISWOLD;

oh, I can conceive it, yes.

But I—my

position is that the prospective rule is not constitutional.
There is no previous case which applies any statute or any
rule ©:: the Commission to newspapers, to all newspapers, and
only to newspapers.

Reference has been made to the NBC case.

That involved the question of affiliation of a station with

Why should the owner of a broadcast station be

forbidden from acquiring another just because ha is a broad­

MR. GRXSWOLE:

I am quits sure it would.

That, it

seises to nss, is exactly what the Court decided in the Grosjcaai
i

case whair® it held that a tax applicable only to newspapers
was invalid.

And,- as this Court has said, with respect to that,

in the Oklahoma Press case, the singling out of the press for
different treatment from that accorded other businesses in
general is invalid.

73
Q

You mean tha statute would be unconstitutional.

MR. GRISWOLD;

The statute would be unconstitutional.

That is what I thoughfc I said.
Q

In other words, you say if there were a statute—

we repeal the Sherman Act and we pass a new statute and say
that monopolies and restraints of trade in the newspaper
business are hereby forbidden.

You say that is unconstitu­

tional?
MR. GRISWOLD %

Mr. Justice, I think that any legisla­

tion by Congress which is applicable only to newspapers would
almost inevitably, be a violation of the First Amendment unless :
maybe it gives them something.
Q

Yes, I was just going to say— Ilaughter]—I was

just going to call your attention to the Hswspapcr Trrcar/atixn
Act which permitted antitrust violations.
MR. GRISWOLD?

I

have always been troubled by the

newspaper Preservation Act, and that of course is a step in the
directim of easing the antitrust laws, giving them something.
and as long as --die antitrust laws nrr, applicable to newspapersand the labor relations Laws have also been held

to b©

applicable to newspapers—I would suppos® that. Congress can
minimize tins situations in which those statutes apply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
gentleman.

Very well.

Thank you.
