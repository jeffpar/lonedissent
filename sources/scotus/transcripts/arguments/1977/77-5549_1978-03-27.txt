Mr. Aprile.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP J. VINCENT APRILS,II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. APRILE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arises cut of a State criminal prosecution
In which the Petitioner, Michael Taylor, was; convicted of the
offense of Second Degree Robbery in violation of the Criminal
Code of Kentucky.
The two constitutional issues presented in this case
are, first, whether the trial judge denied Petitioner his due
process guarantee under the Federal Constitution when he refused
to instruct under presumption of Innocence, when he was requested
to do so by the defense attorney.

And secondly, whether or not

the trial judge denied Petitioner due process under the Federal
Constitution when he refused to give the requested instruction
on the indictment's lack of evidentiary value,
This is a relatively simple criminal prosecution.
State presented only one witness to prove its, case.

The

That was
/

Mr, James Maddox, the victim of the alleged robbery.

The defense

presented one witness, the-' Petitioner, Michael Taylor, testifying
in Ms run behalf.

Mo other-corroborative .evidence was presented

4
by the State of any sort, physical or testimonial.
An analysis of the facts of this case reveals that at
the Inception of the trial during the voir dire of the jury, the
defense attorney attempted to talk to the jurors concerning the
presumption of innocence and the indictment's lack of evidentiary
value.
In his open in.-;, statement* the prosecutor told the jury
that he would have but one witness, the alleged robbery victim,
and that the essence of the Commonwealth evidence would include
the fact that a warrant was taken ag inst Michael Taylor by the
prosecuting witness, and that the «rand jury had returned an indlctment against Michael Taylor.

He then was Instructed by the

trial Judge to rend the Indictment to the jury which he did.
QUESTION:

Would

our constitutional issues be dif­

ferent if ther i hod been ten witnesses on each side?
MR,- APRILS:

''o

You-

\ T- den '•*

necessarily would be, out 1 believe the facts of this case make
Lt a fine vehicle for :Y ev.si'ng on the impact of the presumption
\

of innocence.

In this case, it was clearly the word of one nan

against the word of another.

And if the status of the defendant

as a person who has beer.) arrested, indicted and arraigned is to
be used as any indicia of guilt against him, this could be the
crucial factor in this case to swing the jury to convict this
man in a very, very close case,
the facts in this instance.

and that is why I focused on

5
Without belaboring the facts, I would also like to
point to the fact that under the direct examination of this
prosecution witness, the prosecutor elicited from him that he
had, indeed, reported this crime immediately to the police, that
he had obtained a warrant against the Petitioner and that he had
testified before the grand jury seeking; the indictment, which,
of course, was eventually returned.
Also, the case boiled down to the fact that the de­
fense admitted that Michael Taylor knew the robbery victim, that
he had been to his apartment on three, or so, occasions, and he
adamantly denied that he had participated in this robbery or that
he was present on the night of the alleged crime, February 16,

1976,
At this point, with the evidence in this posture, the
parties met with the trial judge on the instructions.

At that

time, the trial defense attorney requested and tendered instruc­
tions on the presumption of Innocence and the indictment's lack
of evidentiary value.

The trial judge refused to give those in­

structions and gave no comparable version of them.

Instead, he

Instructed on only three things, one, the substantive elements
of the offense of Second Degree Robbery: two, he told the jury
about reasonable doubt and gave a general definition of reasonable
doubt; and third, he instructed them that their verdict must be
unanimous.
In this configuration ~~

At that point, the defense attorney is

still trying to talk to the jury, talk to them about the pre­
sumption of innocence,
QUESTION:

In this jurisdiction, Is any criminal case

ever tried without the essence, if not the exact contents, of the
indictment communicated to the jury?
MR» APRILE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,
How does the jury find out what the charge

is?
MRo APRILE:

Well, It is unique, I suspect, with

regard to other jurisdictions, but I have reviewed many tran­
script of records in which the indictment is never given to the
jury nor read.
QUESTION;

I don't mean given.

Someone tells the jury

wirt the crime —
MR» APRILE:

Normally, the prosecutor gives a synopsis

f the charge in his opening statement.
And I want to make it clear, Your Honor, that it is
not an attack made on the procedure of telling the jurors about
the content of the indictment or reading it to them, or even
giving it to them.

The problem seems to be,In this context,

that there is a conflict between being allowed to do this on the

7
part; of the prosecution and having some means of guaranteeing
that the presumption of innocence is not overridden by a mistake
on the part of the jury that that Indictment is in some way evi­
dence of the defendant's guilt.

And In this posture what the

defense attorney attempted to do was what is done in very many
jurisdictions, and that is to have the trial judge give a
cautionary instruction that the indictment could not be consldered as having any evidentiary value in the case.
QUESTION:

Wouldtyou think that would be more important,

more critical in a situation, as in some jurisdictions, the in­
dictment goes to the jury room with the jurors, along with other
pieces of paper that are evidence?
MB, APRILE:

Well, Your Honor, it might be in certain

cases, but I would say in this case there was not one exhibit
Introduced, this jury didn't have the slightest concept of what
an exhibit was.

All the evidence they heard came from the

witness stand or statements that were made in the course of the
trial*

do they would have no way, really, to differentiate a

paper exhibit, a documentary exhibit, from testimonial evidence.
Ho they were looking at what they had heard in that courtroom,
and they had heard the prosecutor, under instruction of the
judge, read them in complete verbatim fom the indictment.
do I think that while your distinction is valid, and
certainly comes to play in many situations, such as some of the
cases I’ve cited In the brief, it isn't really crucial in this

8
particular case,

I think we 1 : • e to lock at the inner play

that vie have in this partioi lar situation.
that occur.

There are two things

Number one, the trial judge never tells in his in­

struction the jury that the defendant is presumed innocent.
Number two* he does not give them an instruction that the in­
dictment lacks evidentiary value.

Add to this the fact that

even his reasonable doubt instruction that he' gives the Jury
does not deal with the burden of persuasion, that nowhere in' any
of those instructions that he gave does he ever say the burden
of proof is on the prosecution.

Indeed, his instruction .begins

on the substantive offense with the statement, "You will find
the defendant guilty’under this instruction, if and only if
you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt all of
the following."

bhen he .goes into his instruction on a reason­

able doubt, he says, "If, upon the whole case, you have a
reasonable doubt as to the defendant *s guilt, you will find hir.
not guilty," Number one, no statement that there is a presumption
of innocence accorded to this defendant,

Number two, no state­

ment that the prosecution bears the burden of proof, pregoing the
man guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Number three, this prose­

cutor did two things that coalesce both or'these, arguments
together.
Number one, he knew that the indictment had been read
to the jury and he questioned this one witness that lie had
whether or not he had appeared before the grand jury and

9
testified.

It looks to be* on the face of it* that what It was

was an attempt to bootstrap that one witness»*; identification.
In other words, it's an indirect way of saying*
before the grand Jury." "Yes* I did."
indictment?"

"Yes* they did."

"Did you testify

"Did they bring back an

"The grand jury believed you."

That was another reason why this cautionary instruction
was so important.

As this Court pointed out in Estelle v.

Williams* to guarantee the presumption of innocence and the
fundamental fair trial guarantee* you will look with close
judicial scrutiny at practices and procedures that conflict with ■
the presumption of innocenee,
I submit that .in this case the refusal to give the
instruction on the indictment's lack of evidentiary value con­
flicted with the defendant’s constitutional guarantee of a
presumption of innocence.
But look also at what this particular prosecutor did
in this case.

He had just heard* prior to his closing argument*

the trial judge refuse to give an instruction on the presumption
of innocence.

What did he do?

One of the very first things he

said in his closing argument was*

"The defendant* like every

other defendant who has ever been tried* who is in the penitenti­
ary or in the reformatory today* had the presumption of Inno»
cence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." That’s just
a presumption in his behalf.

What die he do?

Number osie, he

equated the presumption of innocence with the concept of people

tlumber two, he indicated ti/ t the presumption of innocence really
doesn't have any validity in a criminal trial, because it cer­
tainly didn't protect all those .

e who are presently con­

fined in tie penitentiaries and penal institutions of Kentucky at
the time of that tri 1,

Number three, he misstated, clearly mis­

stated, the definition of reasonable doubt which was given by the
judge., .fie told the jurors that reasonable doubt in this case
was a big doubt,

He also told them, "Here he Is,

This prose­

cutor is faced with absolutely no evidence but the complaining
witness,"

What did he .say?

He said, "The absence of evidence

in this case clearly equates with the defendant's guilt"-»

QUESTION:

If it is not bankrupt, as you say., and not

constitutionally deficient, what business does this Court have
addressing itself to it?
MB. APRILE:

Well, Your Honor, as I understand it,

you do not, this Court does not wish to evaluate Instructions in
some sort of isolation.

This instruction, while I’m not assuming,

arguendo, that it will pass constitutional muster, I would submit
that it still, standing alone, is so deficient, that it does not
guarantee or protect this man’s right to the presumption of in­
nocence and that hiS guilt be proven by probative evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

Well, similarly to that, Kentucky Appellate

tion.

was unable to find that what you say is the first question
presented, whether Petitioner was deprived of his constitutional
right to due process of law by the refusal of the trial court
to give an instruction on the presumption of innocence when
Petitioner's counsel requested and tendered such an instruction.
X was unable to find that that issue was ever raised in this
case in the trial court or in the appellate courts of Kentucky,
I've looked at the requested instruction, at that transcript.
I don't find that that was ever asserted as a constitutional
claim.

I've looked at the opinion of Judge Howard for the Court

of Appeals of Kentucky and I find that he says,in answer to the
contention, "The well established law of Kentucky has been that
as long as the trial court instructs the jury on reasonable doubt,
an instruction on the presumption of innocence is not necessary,"

that "the Supreme Court of Kentucky would now reject the old line •
of eases relied upon by the majority,"
And the antecedent for that is the Kentucky cases.
MR. APRILE:

Your Honor, it is also the antecedent for

that, the fact that in argument as well as in the briefs I pointed
out that if those cases still existed on the books, they were no
longer valid in terms of your pronouncement in 1976 in Estelle
v, Williams that made the presumption of innocence part and
parcel of the hue Process Clause,

ORAL ARGUMENT. OF. GUY C , SHEARER. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT '
MR, SHEARER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
I am getting a bit aged, I am afraid, to fight fire
with fire, but sometimes you have found yourself in such a
position that you have no other out.

I agree with Mr. Aprile

that this is a balancing contest, in speaking of' what occurred
nere.

Mr. Maddox, the victim in here, was robbed by Michael

25
Taylor.

He was a man who worked -- respected 51 year old man --

at a whiskey store., very diligent, had his own little place where
he had lived for 16 years and a job that he had occupied for 17
years»

He had known Michael Taylor for 15 years, and Michael had

come to his home two or three times, and apparently they were
friends.

On the night in question, Michael brought a man with

him, went to the door and told him they wanted to come In.

He

said,, "No, you can't come in because 1 want to go to bed and go
to sleep." He had a friend with him.
back to bed.

He locked the door and went

Shortly thereafter, fifteen minutes thereafter, he

returned to his home and told him that he was going to let him
In.

He didn't let him but he did unlock the door.

The two men

pushed in the house, pulled him out, robbed him, took his money,
$10 or $15, took his credit cards and the like and then the man
ran away.
QUESTION:

Now, the jury has settled all these issues.

MR, SHEARER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Sir.

Ho the only issue before the Court is —

MR, SHEARER:

The balancing contest was the only

reason for my bringing that up, Your Honor.
What we are here on today, though, is did the Petitioner
Michael Taylor have a constitutional right to have the jury in­
struction of presumption of innocence tendered by his counsel as
-.1 separate instruction.
The Instructions which were tendered here by counsel

QUESTION:

General Sherer# may I interrupt you with

one question# please?
MR, SHEARER:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.

Bo you dispute the fact that.the defendant

comes into court with a clean slate, as far as the jury is con­
cerned?

I didn't understand your argument about the clean slate.

You argued that the Instruction that the defendant tendered was
not correct# as I understood*
MR. SHEARER:

Yes# sir# was not correct as to form

and it would have been an error for him to have accepted it.
QUESTION:

Why is that?

Why does not the defendant

come into court with a clean slate?
MR, SHEARER:
Mr, Justice.

You'll have to a sic his counsel#

Oh# why isn't it?

Well# the prosecutor didn't put it in issue because
it did reflect on his integrity.

He was under probated sentence

for normally receiving, stolen property.

.One pear sentence.
l

23

QUESTION:

Is it not true that for purposes of the

matter on trial he was presumed to toe innocent and presumed to
come In with a clean slate?
MR, SHEARER:

Yes, I agree with you 100$.

It was to

toe — he was free as far as his charge was concerned, until
evidence was introduced against him.
QUESTION:

As far as his charge was concerned, did he

not have a clean slate?
MR, SHEARER;

No, yes.

But here is. the point.

If he

could get an instruction with the slate clean or clean slate
and which was no excuse at all because that was evidence, he
used it as the peg on which to get over to the jury in its
argument that this man was clean slate on everything all the
way through.

It's an old trick.

It's as common as the day is

long.
QUESTION:

As long as we‘ve had courts, we've had the

presumption of innocence.
MR, SHEARER:

Sir?

!

!•

QUESTION:

As long as we've had common law courts —

MR, SHEARER:
QUESTION:

i

That's correct, sir.

i

I

That's right, oh, yes.

MR, SHEARER:

And we've had this argument on this very
(?)

tolling here, goes back to King Dirus over 2,500 years ago.

And

:Ln that you didn't have any specific instruction on it that said
the mouths of two or three witnesses.

That was the burden of

proof you had to meet.

But it showed that the presumption of

innocence followed you until it was overcome and overwhelmed by
avidence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, is it the practice in

Kentucky if a man has the kind of clean slate where he has never
'"seen on probation or parole, or anything at all, then 'does he get
the instruction?
MR. SHEARER:
QUESTION;

Does he get the instruction?

Yes.

If this man had had the kind of clean

slate —
MR. SHEARER:

No. he was not entitled to it at all

with that word "clean slate" in there.
QUESTION:

Even if he had a completely clean slate.

MR. SHEARER:

If he had just said the presumption of

.innocence until he’s proved to be guilty, it would have been all
right, but the clean slate is evidence and has no place in there.
QUESTION:

That’s not'what your Court of Appeals said.

Your Court of Appeals said if the court gives a reasonable doubt
instruction, the court does not have to do any more.
M R, S HEARER:
QUESTION:

So that's the law of Kentucky.

MR, SHEARER:
QUESTION:

Tha t1s correct.

That's absolutely the law of Kentucky.

Up 'fc.il now

(laughter)
MR. SHEARER:

In the case of Coffin, the court did hold

30

that the presumption of Innocence was evidence,

Later,, however*

this Court* in Agnew and Holt. said that it was not evidence.

It

is pure argument*and argument has no place in the instructions
given,

in the cases of Holt and Agnsw* it was recognized that*

for the first time* by this Court that it was not proof or evi­
dence.

Then if it was not evidence or proof* there would not

exist any need for the judge to give an instruction on something
that was not proof.
dence.

The instruction must dovetail with the evi-

And Kentucky law is that the instruction should dove­

tail with the evidence;if the presumption of Innocence is not
evidence* then you can't dovetail an instruction with the evi­
dence.
The State has their own justice system* just as the
Federal court has its district system* has its court of appeals
system* its own rules* and the rules of this Court.
The reason some things weren’t mentioned and didn't go
into the argument before counsel was. it was not preserved at the
State level,,

It could have been* but was not preserved* and

should have been if they thought there was something detrimental
in it and that some deduction was made therefrom which was not
reasonable.

QUESTION:

V.'ell, uccc ’din0 to your brother these were

not brought up for the first time 'here, but were brought up in
the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in its brief, its constitutional
arguments.

Do you agree with that, sir?

Did they make their

constitutional claims in the Court of Appeals of Kentucky?
MR. SHEARER:

No, they did not.

You mean, did they

argue that this was within the constitution frame of conducting —
QUESTION;

No, did they argue that Kentucky law was

unconstitutional, under the Federal Constitution?
MR. aHEARER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

You say they didn't argue that in the Court

of Appeals?
MR. SHEARER:

They did not.

You.r talking about the one witness in this case recalls
to mind the ancient. Latin Legal Maxim• II, that witnesses are
weighed not counted.

And the weight in this case was what-they

were trying to circumvent through tendering an instruction.

That

could have been a good instruction if they had just knocked out
two. or three yjords in it, and then rewrite the instruction pre­
viously given by the court,

is the duty of his counsel.

That

Counsel in this case had no doubt

looked a long time before he found in that Federal form book the
one that contained those words "clean slate" which he tried or
wanted to turn into a peg on which to hang a hope that he could
talk the jury into believing this man's record was spotless.
QUESTION:

Mr» Shearer, am 2 right in thinking now that

the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is an intermediate appellate
court?
MR» SHEARER:

Yes, sir, it is now.

QUESTION: And your highest court is now called the
Supreme Court?
MR. SHEARER:
QUESTION:

Is the Supreme Court, yes, sir.

And I notice at page 59 of the record that

there is an order by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
denying what is denominated "discretionary review."

Does the

Supreme Court have absolute discretion to deny a petition for
Etny ~~ whatever the grounds in the petition?

MR, SHEARER:
QUESTION:

At the State level, that is correct, sir.

Even if it is a Federal constitutional claim,

:„t has discretion to deny it, does it?
MR, SHEARER:

Yes, sir, I think it does.

t

QUESTION:

Would they place that in a case like this on

the grounds that the Federal constitutional claim was not

33
preserved in the trial court?
MR* SHEARER:
QUESTION:

Yes,

That would be one of the bases of discretion'?

MR. SHEARER:

That is correct.

Now, in the Coffin case which was mentioned here, the
Court held it was e/idence,- but later held that the presumption
of innocence and the doctrine of reasonable doubt were not
equivalent.

They were not the same.

I think the Court was

correct in that ruling, but the error — and that was written,
I believe, in 1895* by Mr. Justice White and it was concluded
that the burden then, as it is now, is upon, the Commonwealth to
make its case.

And in this case, we submit that that was done.

Tendered instruction Number 3* tendered instruction
Number 4 all speak for themselves, all have things in them that
are evidence, and it is not evidence.

And the very case that was

cited by the defendant proves that they weren't evidence.
For example. Number 4 there,"the law. presumes the
defendant to be Innocent of a crime."
had stopped there,

That's all right if it

"Thus the defendant, although accused, begins

the trial with a clean slate,"

He doesn't say if no proof were

heard he would be entitled to acquittal or a preemptory dis­
missal.
They have to put oil this other in there to — and then
he ends up saying "bo that presumption of innocence alone is
' r t bo

3 defendant."

It's the lack of proof

alone that is sufficient;.
And as far as the indictment goes* it's a common
practice in our Commonwealth for the defense to get up and take
the paper and say "this is a piece of paper."
of paper with the indictment on it.

He has a piece

And the judge will either confirm it or deny it.

You've got it in front of the jury far

It certainly does.

And some quotations

It shows that thes*- went at great length

into it.
The other thing that was brought out about this slate
clean was that they were trying to make this mon who worked in
a liquor store, probably knowing that some people were prejudiced
against it, or dry, appear that he was not comparable with the
man who had robbed him and was in there using this, employing
this vehicle trying to get an acquittal.
The last thing that he has here in his second question
is that of having an instruction as to the lack of value of an
indictment, that it Is not evidence.
That it is not evidence.
Do not argue with them.

Well, clean slate was.

Those cases are all Federal cases.
But those are cases where they took,

Mr* Chief Justice, the indictment back into the jury room and
where they could place the indictment down and read it and re­
read it,
And these Federal courts have held, and very properly

Hiat if you are going to />•*> that,.an Instruction is going to

know that it is not evidence.

And that should be the law.

And nowhere in those cases is there any consideration given to
the instruction that the indictment lacks evidentiary value in
Kentucky or that it is a constitutional right.

Yet, counsel for

the Petitioner continues to contend that because of the cited
cases the Petitioner was entitled to an instruction on the in­
dictment’s lack of evidentiary value.
The burden of proving that such an instruction is a
constitutional right is not upon the Commonwealth, but it is
upon the Petitioner alleging it.

And this burden the defendant

has not met.
The sum total of the evidence in this case can leave
little doubt that there was nothing more imbued in the minds of
those twelve jurors than the doctrine of the. presumption that a
man is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
And that instruction was given by the judge and that judge

MR. APRILE:

They are not decided in constitutional

Also, I would point out that at no time did the trial
court or the Appellate Court in this cese challenge the giving
of this Instruction on the presumption of innocence, on the basis
that it was defective in any way.

The voir dire in argument was

certainly not part and parcel of the judicial Instruction, and
I've cited many cases to that effect.
