MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 76-5729, Oliphant against the Suquamish
Indian Tribe.
Mr. Malone, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP P. MALONE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. MALONE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
On behalf of the Petitioners, Mark Oliphant and
Daniel Belgarda, Attorney General Gorton and myself will di­
vide arguments of first impression before this Court in the
history of the United States.
That is, as an Indian Tribe, inherent governmental
police powers over non-Indian persons, citizens of the United
States fox* their actions occurring within the boundaries of an
Indian Reservation.
I will first discuss the facts and then argue the
issues involved under the Fifth and the 15th Amendments of the
United States Constitution and the Indian Civil Rights Act of
.

r

1968 which protect the privileges, rights and freedom

of the

Petitioners as non-Indians and non-members of the Tribe from

case,

situation?
MR. MALONE:

was released on his personal recognizance.

Then he

QUESTION:

When he was detained by the Indians, it

is your contention that it was the same as if he had been defcained by the Federal Government?
MR. MALONE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Port Madison Reservation is located entirely
within Kitsap County, Washington, approximately ten miles
across the waters of Puget Sound from downtown

Seattle.

Among the public services provided by the county
and state for the Reservation, as in any other area not within
the Indian Reservation, are school;?, roads, public utilities,
fire protection, social and health services and law enforce­
ment. .
The Suquaraish Tribe provides no services as such to
non-Indians except the police protection and lav.' enforcement
of tribal laws that are claimed in this ease.
The Reservation is similar to the Puyallup
Indian Reservation with which this Court, I am sure, is famil­
iar.

;
The land area of the Reservation is approximately

7,300 acres.

Two-thirds of that land is owned by non-Indians

and sore Indians in fee and that is; subject to local taxes for
payment: of public services.
One-third of the land, s.ppr oxiraa te Xy, in indivi­
dually-owned allotted land with title held in trust;by the
United States for the protection of those individual Indian

6
allottees and it is exempt from taxation and I would — a main
note to make a distinguishing factor that this allotment
arose here primarily under the treaty of Point Elliott...
QUESTION:

These days, is there a termination date

on the trust property?
MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:
MR. MALONEs

No, there isn't.
There used to be.
There used to be.

There was contem­

plated a termination date and as I understand, Congress ex­
tended that period.
QUESTION:
MR. MALONE:

Indefinitely, then.
Indefinitely.

In 1973, the time of the Oliphant incident, the
Tribe had leased to & non-Indian corporation with the approval
of the United

States the last remaining unoccupied, unallotted

trust lands on the Reservation and of that there was a. portion
known as the ballpark.

That is where the Oliphant incident

took place.

*
As of 1973, only SO adult and minor Tribal members

lived on the Reservation.
They were interspersed in the residential areas
among an approximate non-Indian residential population of
3,000 people.
No distinct community occupying any certain area
existed, anywhere on the Reservation in 1973.

7
Ia 1965, of the total enrolled membership of the
1.12 tribal members entitled to vote at tribal elections, 56
members sleeted and adopted a Constitution for the Tribe as
authorized by the Indian Organization Act of 1934 and approved
by the Secretary of the Interior.
It provides for limited powers of government by a
general council and a tribal council.

Franchise to votes is; in

the general council and through an election by the members,
they also elect officers in the tribal council.
The limitation on voting and membership is that
they mast be one-eighth Indian blood and generally 18 years or
over.

The tribal council as such is the executive branch of

the general council.
Bacjav.se of the limited executive powers of th©
tribal ordinances governing the Indians in the Constitution,
which restricts, in effect? the executive body to.regulating
hunting and fishing and shellfishing, ordinances may be pro­
mulgated through the tribal council as such, provided th®
Secretary of Interior approves.
Therefore, the most recent ordinances relative to
this case have been passed by a

general council of all of

the eligible voters and members of the Tribe.
In July, 1973, members of the general councils for
the first flirt® in the history of th® tribe adopted a law and
order code asserting tribal territory jurisdiction as an act

of self-determination over all Indians and non-Indians and
their land, within the Reservation.
The Code was not approved by the Secretary of
Interior.
Tribal crimes are defined in the Code that include
not only minor offenses but also major offenses.

Amongst

those major offenses are assaults,- burglary, theft and rape.
At the same time, the Code provides the tribe that
tribal courts established in the Code do not have juisdiction
over offenses within the; Major Crimes Act of the United States.
Since the Major Crimes Act applies only to offenses
by Indian Affairs, the Tribal Court therefore has jurisdiction
over the Code only over non-Indians and not Indians for those
major tribal offenses as defined, in the Lax* and Order Code.
The Code establishes a judicial system for the first
time in the history of the Tribe, providing for a tribal
court and an appellate court whose judges are the same.
They must be tribal members and have no further
efSiicational qualification than having graduated from high
school.

Their salaries are paid from funds of the United

Srates,.

At the same time, we would note that the members of

•t.'he jury, by recent enactment- of the Tribe, must also be mem­
bers or the Tribe and by being members of the Tribe, that
means tney must have one—eighth Indian blood or more.
In August of 1973, Mr. Oliphant, a.

non-Indian,

9
residing on the Reservation when the alleged violation took
place by him on the Reservation — for years prior to 1973*
a local American Legion had sponsored this event,.

It was

known as Chief Seattle Days and they also took place generally
in this ball park area.
[3]
In 1970, this is where the incident took place, in
the Oliphant case.

At the time, Mr. Oliphant became .involved

in an altercation with campers on the ball park that were
attending that event.

The record does not indicate that the

campers involved in the altercation with

him were tribal

members.
He was arrested and charged by newly-appointed
tribal police officers, not for the altercation with the cam­
pers but for assaulting one of the police officers and resis­
ting arrest.
Due to lack of jail facilities, ha was then im­
prisoned in the City of Bremerton jail off the Reservation for
five days, pursuant to contract that had been made by the
Federal Government with the City of Bremerton for the benefit
of the Tribe to jail prisoners of the Tribe.
QUESTION:

So the offense really that he was

charged with was an altercation between himself and an Indian
' tribal po 1 i.ceman 7
MR. MALONE:

It was — he was charged with resisting

arrest and assaulting one of those
police officers.

QUESTION:

Who was an Indian tribal policeman?

MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Mr. Malone?

MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
What is the size and composition of the

total judicial branch of the Tribe?
I imdersfcood you to say only 53 members reside with*
in the Reservation.

How many of them are members of the

judicial branch or what are their positions?

How many judges,

for example?
MR. MALONE:
QUESTIONS:
MR. MALONE:

There are two judges, to my knowledge.
How many police officers?
At the time, there were a number of

appointed deputies and at the present time I think there are
three or four police officers.
QUESTION:

Do they have a courthouse and a clerk?

What establishment?
MR. MALONE:
appoinr-ed clerk.

They have appointed court •— they have

The courthouse was — in the Belgarde case

was a barbershop.

through that.
I know of no restrictions otherwise.
Now, Mr. Belgsrde, also a non-Indian, resided on the
Reservation in 1974 when he was arrested by the tribal police.
He was driving his automobile on a public highway at the: time
tribal police cars took pursuit of him.
A roadblock was set up by those police on a public
highway on non-Indian land within the Reservation to apprehend
him.

Lelgc.rde * s car collided with one of the police cars and

he was arrested and charged with recklessly endangering a
police officer and damaging the police car.
He, again, was jailed some 50 miles —

MR. MALONE;

The problem there — I cannot answer

for certain because the exact words of the charge is a "public
car" and that the — I believe there was contract with the
United States Government for supplying of police vehicles and
whether the title to that police vehicle was in the United
States Government or in the tribe, I am uncertain,
QUESTION: Was it not clearly marked as a police
vehicle?
MR. MALONE;

And it was clearly marked.
Yes.

Well, in short, turning to the Constitutional situa­
tions here, we have a government — a tribal government may ba
characterised governing all the non-Indian3 on the Reservation
by some Indians and for some Indians with that system subsi­
dised by the Federal Government.
This, then, .leads to the constitutional problems
involved in this case.

I would first bring these problems in

perspective.
My clients and a number of non-Indians, I believe,
have no immediate interest in voting in the Suquamish General
Council.

Their immediate interest is to be free from the

tribal laws; and their enforcement promulgated without their
consent.
They do not want to be subject to independent

14
tribal powers over which they have no control except with resort
to the judiciary but if they may be not left alone,, if they
are to be subject to the tribal criminal code, then the best
choice would be that they would have the right to vote which I
believe and argue that they have under the Constitution.
This would mean, in effect, if non-Indians were
entitled to vote, the very purpose of the claimed powers •
hare or self-determination of tribes would end on such reser­
vations as the Port Madison Indian Reservation.
But if a choice had to be made for their freedom,
they would desire the choice and power and ability to
QUESTION:

vote.

The effect would be quite different in

the Port Madison Reservation on the one hand, which your client
came into contact with and a Reservation like the Navajo
Reservation, which is 20,000 square miles, largely populated
with Indians, would it rot?
MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:

Startlingly different.
Ard that prompts me to ask, Mr. Malone,

•whether whatever principles are forthcoming in this case, you
feel should apply to all Indian Reservations?

MR. MALONE:

I believe that, qualifying my state­

ment; is that, first, to have powers, you should have a commun­
ity that you should represent.
QUESTION:
involving the Navajos.

That is not in this case.

But it is in a case later in the week

15
Are you familiar with that case?
MR. MALONE:

Yes, I am, to a certain extent.

I

would say that as far as the Constitution, the Constitutional
principles apply here.

They apply to the Navajo Indian

Reservation, if they are asserting similar claims over nonIndians .
QUESTION:

Well, then, some of the facts are not

particularly important then.
MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:

That is true.
Unless you were going —* unless it were

possible that there would bs a difference between a crime
committed on trust property and off trust property but still
on the Reservation.

Or a difference between a crime committed

against the Tribe itself and not against the Tribe itself?
for instance, a trespass on tribal property.
Would you think -the Tribe could prosecute somebody,
for that, even though they might not be able to prosecute for
assault, for a. misdemeanor in some bar somewhere?
MR. MALONE:

I believe that the powers of the tribe

should come: from writing.

They should come from the Treaty

or Acts of Congress and not by implication or desire.

That

would be the first limitation so if the treaty — if certain
treaties, they do provide powers to exclude, they have the
powers to exclude people from their lands.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose somebody doss not exclude?

16

Suppose he comes on anyway and there is a tribal
regulation that says anybody who trespasses on our property
has to pay $500.

Then what are you going to say?

MR. MALONE:

Well, I think that -- that becomes

difficult, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION;

It is a little late, is it not?

They

should have put a restrictive covenant in about 1600, should
they not have?
MR. MALONE;
QUESTION;

I would — that is —
Well, Mr. Malone, I gather that you are

arguing what should be argued to Congress and not to a Court.
Now, show me that I am wrong.
MR. MALONE:

Well, I —

QUESTION:

You said the Tribal Civil Rights Law —

the Indian Civil Rights Law, did you not?
MR. MALONE:

Yes.
I

QUESTION:
MR. MALONE;
QUESTION:

Are you going to get to that point?
Ye3.
Before you address that, what other law

enforcement authority was available at the time and place of
these incidents?

What other police officers?

Laying aside

the judges for the moment.
MR. MALONE:

Well, there had been complete county

protection — local county law enforcement continually.
QUESTION:

Were they there

at the scene at

17
the time?
MR. MALONE:

They were at the scene at the Belgarde

case, yes, and there were tribal police cars at the festivity
at the Oliphant case — that took place.
Well, in short, as to the constitutional issues
involved here, I think they are quite clear.

One is the

Fifteenth Amendment of the Right to Vote.
The Fifth Amendment also protects my clients be­
cause of federal action.

There are cases cited in the briefs

that substantiate a direct connection betv/een the Federal
Government and the Tribe here.
QUESTION:

Well, is it your contention that the pro­

vision for the right of habeas corpus in the Indian Civil
Rights Act permits one to raise in that writ rights othe:r than
those that are conferred by the Indian Civil Rights Act?
MR. MALONE:

It reads, the right of determining the

tribal orders, as to the constitutionality of tribal orders.
But — is that my —QUESTION:

Well, I was curious as to whether you

thought that the express provision in the Indian Civil Rights
Act granting the right of federal jurisdiction to hear a writ
of habeas corpus on behalf of someone detained by an Indian
tribe permitted that person to raise claims other than those
granted to him by the Indian Civil Rights Act,
MR. MALONE:

Yes, I believe that the purpose of the

18

Indian Civil Rights Act was to give protection to any person
before — by tribal order of the court and it was not just
restricted to those rights in. the Civil Rights Act,
Section VIII of the Civil Rights Act, in effect, is
the same word language as the Fifth Amendment protections.
QUESTION;

But there is nothing in legislative

history on that point?
MR. MALONE:

Well, I have no answer to that, as to

the legislative history.
QUESTION:

Mr. Malone, you have submitted to us

here constitutional claims.

We do not reach those> however,

at all? do we, unless we resolve the statutory issues against
you?

Do we not first proceed to canvass the statutory issues

and determine whether or not the statutory issues to which
these briefs axe largely addressed determine whether or not
the law provides that non-Indians shall be prosecuted on this
Reservation by the Tribe under Indian law?
MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:

Yes, I agree.
Hava we got, in other words, the cart-

before the horse a little bit?
MR. MALONE:
QUESTION:

That is true.
I assume your co-attorney here is going

to handle the statutory issue.
MR. MALONE:

That is right.

The Attorney General

will take that up and satisfy the statutory issues because if

19
there is no inherent sovereignty and the Court holds that,
obviously we do not have the constitutional issues before the
Court.
With that, if

there are no further questions, I

will withdraw.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General.

3LADE GORTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON
ON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON AS AMICUS CURIAE
GENERAL GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
One remark, Mr. Justice Powell, on your factual
question; in each case, these Petitioners were jailed in state
facilities, city jails, in Bremerton and Port Angeles pursuant
to contracts between those cities and the Federal Government.
QUESTION:

And it would be the same if they had

been arrested by an FBI agent, would it not?
GENERAL GORTON:

Yes.

At the outset, it is well to

note the expansive scope of Respondent's claim, that the Tribe
has jurisdiction to try non-citizens in this instance under
its laws, even though they may not participate in making those
laws derived principally from the Tribe's retained inherent
powers of government which is unlimited except as expressly
qualified by treaty or statute.
QUESTION:

There is nothing really unique

that, is there, Mr. Attorney General?

If he

about

crossed the line

20

into the next state, he would be subject to some laws that he
had no part in making»
GENERAL GORTONs

Yes, on a residential basis,

Mr. Chief Justice, if he- went to Idaho, ha could become a
citizen of Idaho on that day under your decision in Dunn v„
Blumstoin.
QUESTION *

I am speaking —

GENERAL GORTON:
QUESTION:

For example, there is no duration -

— I am speaking of a man who is just

going over to a fair or a football game in the next state.
GENERAL GOKTCN:

That is true, but these two persons

are both residents of the Reservation over which the juris­
diction is asserted.
As a matter of fact, the Respondents* brief offers
no source for the power asserted here of the retained inherent
sovereignty.
claim.

The Solicitor General presents the same broad

The tribal jurisdiction here asserted is an aspect of

residual tribal autonomy which can only be lost by the terms
of the treaty or statute.
QUESTION:

Where do we **- Mr. Attorney General, I

suppose you were going to tell us

but where do vre turn to

answer that; question?
GENERAL GORTON;
QUEStXON:
law or what?

That is exactly where; 1 propose ~~

Is it some statute or just from case

21

law or what?
GENERAL GORTON:

It is a statuta or a treaty.

This Court hc.s rejected the analysis which
Respondents of the United States present here.

It has never

authorized any exercise of Indian jurisdiction over the person
or property of a non-Inclian based on the platonic notion of
sovereignty,

to quote: Mr. Justice Marshall in McClanahan.

This Court has upheld the Indian claims for tribal
jurisdiction over non-Indians only when this authority for
assertion can be found in a specific treaty provision or
statute and, of course, that is exactly the position which we
are taring here.
QUESTION:

Well, has it ever held that it could

not ba found someplace else?
GENERAL GORTON:

It has always been very careful

to avoid basing the finding on sovereignty even when it makes
lip service to it.
QUESTION:

Well, then, X guess your answer is no.

GENERAL GORTON:

Yes.

Yes, my answer is no.

To

our knowledge, there have been only three cases in which this
Court countenanced even a modest claim of Indian jurisdiction
over non-Indian activities and in each of these castes, the
Court used the McClanahan approach, finding the source in
either a treaty provision or a statute.
ln Morris v. Hitchcock in 1904, this Court found to
6

22

be valid legislation of the Chickasaw Nation levying a permit
tax on horses and cattle owned by non-Indians but grazing on
Chickasaw land.

The Court found the authority for the tax

lay both in the Curtis Act and the treaty under which the
Chickasaws

held fcbeir land but note, even so, even under

those circumstances with a highly-organized Indian government,
the sanction for failure to pay the tax was expulsion from the
Reservation by federal official, not a criminal prosecution in
the Chickasaw Tribal Court.
In Williams versus Lee -—
QUESTION:

The Chickasaws were one of the Five

Civilized Tribes?
GENERAL GORTON:

Yes, this was Oklahoma ™ well, it

was Indian Territory.
In William?; y. Lee this Court prohibited a- licensed
Indian trader on the Navajo Reservation from suing his Indian
debtor in r, state court, leaving him to pursue his claim, if
ha chose to do so, in the Navajo Tribal Court.
The exclusive: jurisdiction of that court was found
to res'; in the 1868 treaty between the United States and the
Navajos.
And finally, in the United States v. Masuria, you
validated an explicit statutory delegation by Congress of its
power >o control on-Reservation tavern licensing to the resi­
dant Indian Tribe.

But the M&suries were convicted of the

23
violation of a federal statute in a Federal District Court.
They were not before a tribal court charged with the violation
of a tribal ordinance.
Moreover,

this consistent view of this Court., that

claims of residual sovereignty standing alone are not suffi­
ciant grounds to support a claim of tribal jurisdiction over
non-Indians has been matched step-for-step by the Congress
and the Executive.
In 1834, immediately after the passage of the
Trade and Intercourse Act of that year, the Attorney General
of the United States expressed his view.

The Congress passed

that law, and I quote, "On the assumption that under the
treaties, Indian laws would be applicable only to Indians
themselves.S!
The same opinion takes the position that for such
author ity v:.o exist in an Indian Tribe, it must be given by the
United States.
Nor did the legislative history of the 1834 Act
proceed from any other assumption.

The clear implication is

that either the United States or the Tribe might have juris­
diction but not both.
The Congress elected federal jurisdiction over nonIndians .
In 1854, the Congress reinstated the Treaty
Exception in its present form.

24
QUESTION:

Is your submission that Congress has, in

effect, passed a statute or several of them that says, "There
is no such thing as retained power1'?
GENERAL GORTON:

It is our position that the law

of the United States is that the Indian tribes must show their
right to try non-Indian© either in a treaty or a —
QUESTION:

Well, now, I understand your position.

I am just trying to find out where you found the law on that.
Is that just something you just picked out of the air some­
where or are you saying that Congress in effect has a statute
which says, "No retained power and that the Tribe may exercise
only such powers over non-Indians as you can find in the sta­
tute or treaty."
GENERAL GOETONs

I ara stating that the Congress

has stated that there is no Indian power to try the nonIndians in these cases but that a subsidiary —
QUESTION:

You are nest just suggesting that Congress

has said that there is a law someplace that — some constitu­
tional principle or
general

what?

GORTONt

1 am stating two separate proposi­

tions, that, this Court consistently has held that Indian
powers over non-Indians must be found in a treaty or statute.
In add. felon to that, I am saying that the Trad© and Intercourse
Act rather explicitly denied that right and put exclusive
jurisdiction over this kind of activity in the United States

at the time of those Acts, that the Attorney General of the
United States at the time of the Trade and Intercourse Acts
took exactly that position on two different occasions than
that the courts of the United States, the courts lower than
this Court , were takingQUESTION:

on that position.

Do you say the same thing about the

tribal sovereignty over Indians?
GENERAL GORTON:

That, Mr. Justice White, is a very

interesting question which, of course, is not directly invol­
ved in tills case and —
QUESTION:

Well, can you just answer yes or no, do

the cases or the Congress recognize some sort of retained
inherent power of the Tribe over Indians?
GENERAL GORTON:

There is only one case in which

this Court, has even remotely based its decision on the retained
tribal jurisdiction ever over tribal members, in Tilton versus
Mayes.

Even there, the power to try the Indians in the first

place seems to stem from a treaty.
Whether or net this Court would continue that view
even as to Indians I think is a moot questions.
Mr. Justice Harlan, the 19th century Mr. Justice
Harlan dissented.

He might have been as prophetic in that as

ha was in Plessie versus Ferguson.
In any event, the jurisdiction of the Indians to
try Indians may be found in the Trade and Intercourse Act

26
which explicitly states

that the United States, in effect,

recognizes the rights of the Indian Tribes to try the nonIndians „
QUESTION:

Well, your response to Mr. Justice

White’s question is they all depend on implication, do they
not?

That Congress saw fit to confer particular jurisdiction

on federal courts in certain situations and on Indian Tribes
in other situations

and if that had existed independently of

Congressional action, Congress would not have gone ahead and
done it.
GENERAL GORTON:

Exactly.

In addition, there is

another statutory scheme in connection with these Reservations
in the State of Washington which I suspect but do not know is
paralleled in most other Western states.
The sovereignty of the United

States over the area

which is now the State of Washington under the concepts of
sovereignty which have always been accepted in Western civili­
zation and the United States came from explorations beginning
with those of Robert Gray and from a series of treaties, the
Louisiana Purchase, treaties with Spain and Great Britain
culminating in the treaty with Great Britain of 1846 under
which we settled the Northwest frontier of the Urii-ced States.
At that point, the United States claim t6
eignty over the Washington area was
plete.

sover­

total, absolute and com-.

27
Moreover, two years later, the United States
organised that area into the Oregon Territory and the Oregon
Territory Statute says on this subject, "Nothing in this Act
shall be construed to impair the rights of persons or proper­
ties now pertaining to the Indians in said territory so long
as said rights shall remain unextinguished by treaty."
"Rights of persons or properties," Now, does this
mean

that the United States recognised — this is before any

of the Indian treaties were signed —* criminal jurisdiction by
Indian Tribes over non-Indians, unlimited in subject matter
and geography except by the borders of the Washington Terri­
tory?
I think that to state that question answers it.

It

means exactly the opposite, that the United States, recognised
in the Inc!: ans no power except rights of person or property
which

.heme.elves depended on that Oregon Territory statute.

All ei' e was subsumed into the sovereignty of the United State».
In 1854, when the Trade and Intercourse Act was
passed in its present form, at least for the purposes of this
argument here today, the United States withdrew from federal
jurisdiction certain authority to prosecute Indiana.and nonIndians where a Tribe held exclusive jurisdiction — and I am
quoting now — "By treaty stipulations."
Later in that same year, 1354, in full knowledge
of this provision, the United States presented the Treaty of

28

Point: Elliott to the Suguamish Indians.

That treaty contained

no treaty stipulations conferring exclusive jurisdiction over
non-Indians to the Tribe and the next year, in 1855, the
Attorney General of the United States restated his early
opinion that Indian Tribas may receive jurisdiction over nonIndians only from Congress.
In 1878 a circuit court in Ex Parte Kenyon held that
the federal statute limited Tribal Court jurisdiction to
offenses by Indians against Indicans.
Now, from that point on, 1878 at the latest, the
judiciary, the Congress and the Executive were in complete
agreement.

As late as 1170, the Solicitor of the Department

of the Interior adhered to the same conclusion.

Indian Tribes

do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians.
True, that opinion was withdrawn in 1974 but not
until the Solicitor General's brief in this case has the
Federal Government ever expressed & contrary view.
Now, what has happened as a result of that view?
In reliance on these consistent, longstanding views,
literally tens of thousands of United States citizens have
purchased land and settled on Indian Reservations in full
confidence that they have not waived their rights to selfgovernment and to participation in the administration of their
criminal justice system.
Zt seems to ua far too late in the day now, at least:

29

in the absence of a clear declaration of Congressional intent,
for the United States to tell these citizens that it was wrong
and that they are"in the situation of anyone living in a for­
eign country," to quote precisely the

extraordinary sub­

mission of the Solicitor General in this case — not only a
foreign country, but a foreign country in which they could
never become naturalised citizens.
These citizens have not chosen to live in a foreign
country and they do not do so now.

GENERAL GORDON:

Under the McBratney Exception, if

the crime does not involve Indians,, the original crimes in
these cases — the altercation in the ball park — are clearly
under

they are under federal jurisdiction, absent Public Law 280.

GENERAL GORTON:

Congress at least has to try

Whether Congress car. con­

stitutionally give the Indians this jurisdiction, is another
point v/hicl. was at least adverted to.
QUESTION:

And you would not concede that.

31

GENERAL GORTON:

I do not concede that.

In our

view, whether by statute or by Constitution, tribal selfgovernment ends where the common self-government of all citi­
zens begins.
May I reserve the balance of my argument?
QUESTION:
Gorton.

Let me ask you one question, General

Your argument would apply equally, I suppose,to the

20,000 square miles of the Navajo Reservation and some person
driving from Phoenix to Denver and spending about 120 miles
on the road going through that Reservation.
GENERAL GORTON:

It would have a very substantial

impact upon that situation.

X cannot tell you that it would

govern it because there are at least two differences between
this and that situation, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
The first is that the individual whom you posited
is not a resident and therefore does not have any right to
self-government and secondly, the Navajo treaties may be
different from the treaties with which we are dealing here,
that jurisdiction may have been given to the Navajos but I
just do not know the answer to that question.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY D. ERINS TOFF, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. ERNSTOFF:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

32
The case before you I consider to be basically a
fairly routine except, of course# for the novel legal questions!
behind it — law and order case.
The only question really is — and I think the last
series of questions pointed this out — who is going to have
what we call misdemeanor jurisdiction over all persons within
an Indian Reservation?
The alternative

at thin point# so far as the law

is stated, is the Tribe or the Federal Government and I would
pose that tiny federal judge sitting in any of the federal
courts around this country who was told that he was going to
have to have in his courtroom all of the littering offenses#
failure to step for a stop sign, failure to signal for a turn,
that he would have to be prosecuting those under the Assembla­
ti ve Crimes Act, which is what the U.S. Attorney would have to
do, world tend to agree with the position.
QUESTION;

Well, the ones in the Sixth Circuit are

not crazy about prosecuting the Black Lung cases either, I
take it.
MR. ERRSTOFF:

1 would presume so, Your Honor.

But the question — I think it is a serious ques­
tion, ai matter of federal judicial policy aside from the legal
issues that are involved and that is —
QUESTION;

What do you do about old Army camps?

MR. ERMSTOFFs

Well, the Army camps -- my

33

understanding is, there is a system of military justice as
well as the federal courts.
QUESTION:

The federal magistrate is there.

MR. ERNSTOFF:

The federal magistrate is used.

QUESTION:

Well, put a federal magistrate here.

MR. ERNSTOFF:

Well, perhaps, but thus far, at least

in Seattle,, I am sure that the Chief Justice has heard every­
one complaining about not enough federal judges and federal
magistrates.

There does not seem to be a great deal of time

available,
QUESTION:

None of this will settle this case,

will it?
ME. ERNSTOFF:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I think, though, more important is to understand,
really, what the case is about in terms of the treaties and
the agreements between Indian tribes and the United States
and perhaps? .1 am trying to attempt to make this too large a
case for what seems to be a relatively minor issue in terms of
the offense but that is, what do the treaties do?
And I think it is important for the Court to under­
stand this „
The treaties established what was to be the final
homeland for Indians in this country.

Anyone who is knowledge

able about Western history, certainly in our state, knows that
k-''-.ucal.j.y ^.oameo tnrougnout rhe state anci ‘chey agreed

34
there were no wars in the State of Washington»

They agreed

basically to cede land to the United . States Government in
exchange for being given their Reservation as a homeland.
Now, I acknowledge that, because of the United
States Government, Federal Government, there is an anomaly
today and. that is that these Reservations, non-Indians were
allowed to settle on them, whether through the General Allot­
ment Act or through treaty provisions which in this case is
what prevails.

The allotments, the assignments of land were

rnacle through the treaty, not the General Allotment Act — or
whether through the opening up of Reservations to settlement.
And the question that remains now is, how is this
anomaly go:.ng to be dealt with?

I am the first to acknowledge

that it is, I think, an important question, the fact that peo­
ple living within the Reservation cannot participate in tribal
government..
But the question remains then, which way does one
go?

Ad it seems to me that the danger to American Indian

policy and to the promises of this government in telling
Indian tribes that in choosing between — because of this
anomaly — in choosing between these two alternatives, that
V7:> have chosen basically to eliminate any control you might,
have on your Reservation over non-Indian trespasses or other
committers of minor offenses is the wrong way to go and is
really going to harm Indian interests and the interests that

35
this Court has upheld in previous cases, in recent cases, much
more than the harm that might be done to the

non-Indian who

I admit is in an unfortunate situation.
I think that the question that was asked earlier
by the Court about 'Should you not be arguing to Congress about
this?" is the proper question.

This Court has always held

that Congress is the place to determine how jurisdiction
should be allocated amongst states, Federal Government and
the Indian tribes and in fact, Congress has taken this chalenge since the case began in the District Court.
Congress established an Xl-raan commission, the
American Indian

Policy Review Commission, to investigate over

a period of two years — a very extensive Congressional
Commission investigation — matters of jurisdiction on Indian
Reservations and to come up with legislative solutions and
that report was Issued — this was in the brief — was issued
in May of 1977.
There were six members of Congress on the Commission
and five Indians on the Commission, Indian leaders, and that
Commission said that they find that not onl^ do they as a
matter of lav/ consider that Indian tribes have jurisdiction
over non-Indians but because of the heinous situation in most
Wester?

fa cates5 the c it is necessary and there is a cataloguing of all
the problems in the

State of Washington.

36

QUESTION:

You don't suggest this is an Act of

Congress?
MR. ERNSTOFF:

No.

What I am suggesting, though,

is that the answer to the question, "Shouldn’t Congress be
dealing with this?" is correct.

That is where this ought to

be behind closed doors.
QUESTION:

The fundamental difference between you

and your opponent is, who has the burden of proof with Con­
gress, as I understand it.
Your opponents say unless Congress has conferred
jurisdiction on the Indian tribes they do not have it and you
say, unless Congress has taken it away, they do have it —
MR. ERNSTOFF:
QUESTION:

I think that is —

And I do not see how this rapport really

moves the ball one way or the other.
MR. ERNSTOFF:

It does not.

One hopes that legisla

tion will come for this and it is ny position that a legisla­
tive framework, a legislative solution which takes a great
deal of tire and lot of discussion and much testimony to de­
cide how to deal with these problems is a much better solution
than this Court having to deal with the problem in terms of
exacting definitions of elimination of tribal —
QUESTION:

But this case is here and now and not

five years from now.
QUESTION:

That all could have been handled by

37

not arresting these men*
MR. ERNSTOFF:

That brings up the problem of the

facts, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, before we move on, this is not

just a matter for legislative solutions,

if there is anything

in the constitutional claims made by your opponent because
even though your position were clear as a matter of legisla­
tion or treaty, we still, then, would have the constitutional
claims to deal with, would we not?
MR. ERNSTOFF:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

I was really *—■

Checking on the claims and, for example,

is there a jury trial?
MR. ERNSTOFF:

There is a right to a jury trial

under the Indian Civil Rights Act.

QUESTION:

For these offenses.

And how many eligible jurors are there?

MR. ERNSTOFF:

At this point, the number of eligi­

ble, jurors are the members of the tribe.
QUESTION:

Well, not even all members of the tribe.

I assume some of them are children, are they not?
MR. ERNSTOFF:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

that is a very important point and that is ■—

QUESTION:

Well, just answer.

MR. EKNSTOFF:

When' these problems come up — the

answer to the question is, it is very posssible, for instance,
that the lack of non-Indians on the venire to

be selected

for the jury is, in fact, impermissible under the Indian
Civil Rights Act.

You would have about the same jury every

case, would you not?
MR. ERMSTOFF:

The point I am making is that that

is exactly what the —
QUESTION:

What is the answer to my question?

The answer is yes.

At this point

QUESTION:

And none of the jurors would be of the

MR. ERRSTOFF:

That is correct and it may be

impermissible under the Indian Civil Rights Act.

It is up to

the Federal Court to determine that and it has not yet beer
determined,
What I am saying and this is what this Court said
in the United. States versus Mazurie.

Since 1968

there has been the Indian Civil Rights Act and these petitioner
had no problem invoking that act and in attempting to get

reviewed on what they considered to be the violation of their
statutory rights.
QUESTION:

Yes, those are statutory rights, though.

American citizens have constitutional rights, do they not?
MR. ERNSTOFF:

American citizens have constitutional

rights but most constitutional rights of the first ten

Amend­

ments are rights as against the state government and against
the Federal Government.
This Court in 1397, in Talton versus Mayes, held
that those constitutional rights, the Bill of Rights, did not
apply to the actions of Indian tribes.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Exactly.

And therefore, these

defendants are deprived of the; constitutional rights that are
accorded to most American citizens, if not all others.
MR. ERNSTOFF;

It is a matter of definition.

If

one doss not have a constitutional right and this Court has
determined that, one is not being deprived of it,

The question being presented here -

talking about here about that gap in law enforcement that
occurs when the only jurisdiction able to deal with misdemea­
nors on the Reservation is the Federal Government and the

3: can tell you as attorney for the Tribe how diffi­

cult it is to get the F.B.L to come out to an Indian Reserva­
tion to investigate something other than a major crime and the
question is not one of, does this Tribe have jurisdiction and
no one else?
The question is one of misdemeanor concurrent, juris­
diction .
I think it is important to realise in the history
of the cases since 1973 when this case started that there are
almost no, if any,, cases on any other Indian Reservations
dealing with jurisdiction over non-Indians and I think it is
an important question.
Many tribes, and the amicus briefs show this, are
exercising such jurisdiction.

Several tribes have had thou­

sands of non-Indians before their courts and not one of them
has filed s. habeas corpus action.

part of the Attorney General about what harms are going to be
done.

MR. ERNSTOFF:

I do agree with that.

QUESTION:

Well, what do we have to do with policy?

MR. ERMSTOFF: ■ Well, the Attorney General has
raised the question of what I consider to be policy of in what
way the misdemeanor jurisdiction should be decided and what is
going to happen to the residents of these Reservations and 1
am merely countering that to show that in fact nothing serious
has really happened to cause any federal court anywhere to
come down on an Indian Tribe that is exercising that juris­
diction ..
QUESTION:

Do you think that somewhere in the

<

f aera..;, law system that you find some authority for the Indian
Tribe to exercise the jurisdiction that you claim they have?
MR. ERNSTQFF:
QUESTION;

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

Where do you find this?

42
MR. ERNSTOFF:

Mr. Gorton attempted to say that this

Court has never decided this issue before and the answer is
yes, if you had, we would not be here today.

But this Court

has decided other cases that come close to the issue or deal
with analytical matters that come under that issue.

Let us

take tine United States versus Mazurie, decided tv/o years ago.
Clearly,, it was a delegation case, can the United
States Government delegate the power of the liquor to an
Indian Tri.be?

But Mr, Justice Rehnquist, in writing the

opinion, does not really rely on the question of delegation
because he notes that in order to delegate a power, the body
that is receiving it has to have soma sort of independent
power over the matters at hand and in the United States versus
Ma zurie. decided two years ago, this Court held that Indian
Tribas are unique aggregations, possessing attributes of sover­
eignty over both their members and their territory and used
that analysis to determine the fact the Tribe could decide
whether or not the Mazuries, non-Indians on fee-patent land,
could sell liquor.

Indian Tribes cannot

They cannot enter into treaties with other nations;.

But this Court has consistently held that there are powers
that have not been taken away.
Let me give an example.

If Mr. Gorton is right —

and you have got to look to some kind of federal statute to
determine what powers the Tribe has got, Indian Tribes would
not be able to point to one single treaty or statutory enact­
ment which would justify the exercise of most of their powers
including powers which this Court has upheld.

sis under those cases that Indian Tribes must retain whatever
it was they were except that which was expressly taken away
by Congress, by treaty, or, in the analysis of this Court,
has to be viable because if it is not, then Indian Tribes
really possess almost no power.

Court has recognized the: power, how can I point to a statute
which gave the Tribe that power?

All I can point to is

this

Court's analysis of the fact that one does not need a statute
or a treaty in order to determine that there is a power.
Take a look at Williams versus Lee.

Williams versus

bee in 1959, this Court said that a non-Indian must go to
Tribal Court for a civil matter in order to have a judgment
entered for him to be able to benefit from a debt that was
owed to him and the Court said, in Williams versus Lee:, "It
is immaterial that Respondent is not an Indian.

the Reservation and the transaction with an Indian took place
there.1!

after the Treaty with Great Britain and before the Treaty of

the Tr:;.be will give up jurisdiction, criminal jurisdiction
over non-lndxs'.ns and will have criminal jurisdiction only over
its own members — a specific provision.

This is in the brief.

That language was written by the attorney who was
the Secretary of the Treaty Commission on December 10, 1854.
Six weeks later, on January 22nd, 1855, the Point '

49

Elliott Treaty was signed.

The only provision of a 15-section

draft treaty which had been written for the purpose of nego­
tiation, the only provision that does not find its way into
the Point Elliott Treaty are those express words , that the
Tribe will give up, non-Indians will not have jurisdiction
over non-Indians and will turn then over to the United States
for prosecution.
Every other provision of the draft treaty is in

I can’t tell you that the Indians were

clever enough in IB55 tc negotiate a waive act because they
knew what trouble it would bring them but some conclusion must
be drawn from the fact that the Commissioners at that time —
and this is 20 years after the passage of the 18 34 Trade; and
Intercourse Act,felt it necessary to negotiate and to put into
a treaty a provision terminating jurisdiction which Mr. Gorton

QUESTION:

Well, what we have here, however, is not

fie 1834 Tx;t but the Amendment of 1854 which predated the' con­
clusion of this treaty,
MR. ERMSTOFF:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And that 1854 statute said that the

50

United States should have federal criminal jurisdiction within
any Indian Reservation with three exceptions and the third
exception, which is the only one applicable here, is any case
where by treaty stipulation the exclusive jurisdiction over
such offenses is or may be secured by the Indian Tribes res­
pectively,,
MR* ERNSTOFFs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And certainly the negotiators for the
«

United Stares of America, knew of the enactment of that sta­
tute in 18154 when they concluded this treaty in 1855 and they
realised that in the absence of stipulations to the contrary,
the Tribe, under the 1854 Act, simply would not have criminal
jurisdiction over the non-Indians.

Is that not the reason

that that original provision was deleted because it was not
necessary from the point of view of the United States?
MR. ERHSTGFF:

No, I do not believe so, Your Honor,

because one has to remember, again, we are examining a period
in time of which we have little record but it was well after
tna 18.54 enact.ir.ant that the Secretaries of the Commission,
before they actually went out on this trip to negotiate
treaties, put a provision in, not that gave the tribe exclu­
sive jurisdiction but that took it away.
After the 18E4 Act, it was not necessary to take
away tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians had the 1854 enact­
ment actually done that.

There had to be treaty stipulation to

50 the answer to the question is, no, we are not
claiming exclusive jurisdiction.

I can tell you that the U.S.

Attorney and the federal courts had really not much desire to

terms of a prosecution.

They are relatively minor offenses.

but for non-Indians — if the Tribe cannot do that, what is

And the second reason, and perhaps the more impor­

upon the Federal Government.
Norton

This Court said in' Mancari versus

just two years ago, it talked about the paternalistic

attitude of the Federal Government and the fact that Indian,
interests basically suffered because the Federal Government
said to Indians, "We'll take care of you.”

By the Tribe because that is consi­

MR. ERNSTOFF;

That is correct.

QUESTION:

money goes to the Tribe and to the

tribal uses and that is just —
MR. ERNSTOFF;

For the tribal use for all Indians

Law enforcement on the Reservation, the

tribal police officers — and there are ten, not three — the
tribal police officers and the three tribal police cars go
through the entire Reservation.
They

do not stop — and this Court pointed out,

for instance, in Moe and in Seymour versus Superintendent the
problems of trying to use a tract book in going through an
Indian Reservation to determine whether or not you are on
trust lane or fee land.
Think of how much work it would be if they had to
get out genealogical charts at the same time and bgfore,they
made an arrest, they had to look and see, first of all, is it
fee or trust land?

Secondly, is it a member of the Tribe or

not?

too, but the Tribe —
QUESTION:

X Do not see how you make these argu­

ments when you realize that.
MR. ERNSTOFF:

The situation would apply to

felonies, also.

But as to felonies, the Tribe basically has

not been involved in any kind of prosecution.

The Tribe has

allowed and would hope that the Federal Government and the
state would take that over.
The point I am making is that the lav/ would apply
and that is why, very quickly, to deal with the Fifteenth
Amendment question, that is why it is an irrelevant question.
Indianess is not a racial classification.

This

Court has already decided that in Mancari versus Norton.
Indianess is a political status.
A man can be barely an Indian in terms of his blood
and be a member of the Tribe and therefore come under the
definition of Indian at at the same time, another man can be
a whole-blood Indian but a member of a different Tribe and he
would be in the same status as the non-Indian resident of the
Reserva tier:.
Let’s make that very clear.

We are talking about

a political status and not a racial classification.
i believe that if this Court, were to examine the
authorities that are in our brief — and it is a very compli­
ca tea issue.

I acknowledge that.

It is one that has never

beers decided by the Court before or we would not be here and
if the Court were to taka its own analyses in related areas
and, more important, if the Court were to take a look at some­
thing like- the American Indian Policy Review Commission Report,

the Court would see that without this kind of jurisdiction,

MR. ERNSTOPF:

the supposition that non-Indians would not receive justice in
Indian tribal courts and X would venture to say that -the jus­

what the situation is.

I think that the non-Indians have available to them
the Indian Civil Rights Act and I think that the lav/ will
develop — we have suggested, for instance, in our brief, the
concept of a tribal subject matter interest test for this
Court to establish, which is really what you have been using,
where "he Tribe has an interest and can show it? where it is
not totally unrelated to the Tribe,, then the Tribe will have
jurisdiction and we have used, for instance, the long-arm

QUESTION:

Mr, Ernstoff, before you sit down, am I

correct, did 3/cur firm, in addition to the Respondents5 brief
also file a brief amicus?
MR, ERNSTOFF:

We represent a number of tribes and

two Tribes, clients of ours, requested that we file an amicus
brief on the issue only of Public Law 280 jurisdictions.
QUESTION:

So you get a one-two punch.

MR. ERNSTOFF:

Well, we could have put it in our

original brief, Your Honor but the United States had informed

G2
us that they were going to request that matter not be heard
as pare of this case since it is an ancillary issue.

It was

never decided by the Ninth Circuit in this case and we felt
rather than burden the Court with a very long brief, that it
made more sense to incorporate by reference an amicus brief
which set out the arguments should the Court want to hear them,
QUESTION;

Do you often file amicus briefs in cases

in which you are counsel, for one of the primary parties?
MR. ERNSTOFF:

We have done that once before in

this Court, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Which case Wets that?

MR. ERNSTOFF:

Tenaeio versus State of Washington.

A number of tribes filed amicus briefs on issues which were
ancillary to the basic issue.

We feel that our clients cer­

tainly have a right to fee represented and even though we
happen to be counsel for both sides.
And I did not write the amicus brief. Your Honor,
that was submitted.
QUESTION;

Yes, but your firm has done it end you

are a partner in the firm.
MR. 3RRST0PF:

That is correct, Your Eonor.

I did

not know that it was improper and if it is# we certainly would
not do it again.

We really were frying to relieve the Court

of the burden of a very long brief on what are really two
separate issues# one of which has been briefed very thoroughly

in another case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ernsfcoff, there is no conflict

between the position of your client and the position of the
amicus?
MR. ERNSTOFFs
Your Honor,

No, it is the exact same position,

We incorporate it by reference in our brief.

we felt the Court might want to refer to but not have in front

Because the issues in this case are numerous and

I would like at the outset to male© clear what the position of
the United States is and is not.
First, at the heart of our submission arid directly
opposed tc the position taken by Petitioners in the State of
•

»-

M

Washingtonf is the priciple that the Indian Tribes' do not
depend upor the United States for the creation of thair
powers of government.

These powers instead arc derived from

an inherent; sovereignty that antedates the European settlement

64
of the United

States and, indeed, the formation of the United

States itself.
Now, in the questioning earlier in this case, it
has'been asked whether, in fact, we depend on particular
federal statutes or treaties to establish that power.

itself.

QUESTION:

Or the Constitution.

MR. FARR:

Or the Constitution of the United States

We do not depend on those.

We believe that the

sovereignty antedates all of that and in fact, the reason
that Congress did not pass statutes, for example, creating
the severe:.gnty of the Tribes.
QUESTION:

And you suggest we should just assume

to recognise that?
MR. FARR:

I believe that the Court has recognised

it before and should again, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, even if we buy that position one

hundred percent, the question would still remain whether or
not that historic sovereignty included the power to try and
convict next-tribal members of criminal offenses in violation
o- tribal law and certainly historically, before the white man
got here, it did not, by hypothesis.
MR. FARR:

Before the white man —- a 13. right, before

there were anybody but Indians, it had to cover only Indians
itself.
QUESTION:

Right.

65

MR. FARR:

However, we believe that even when the

white settlers did. get here that the sovereignty of the Indian
Tribes —• who at that time, of course, were dealing by treaty
with the settlement nations, were occasionally at war with
them, did extend far enough at least to protect themselves
against intrusions by whites for crimes against the Tribe
itself or against its members and that that sovereignty con~
tinues now„
QUESTION:

Do you think that that was changed at all

by the first sentence of the First Amendment of the Fourteenth
Amendment that reads, "All persons born or

naturalized in the

United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are
citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they
reside ’?
MR. FARR:

Nc, I do not.

QUESTION s

You think that there is no negative

implication of ruling out other

sovereignties than the United

States or the state in that?
MR. FARR:

I think in terms of pure sovereignties,

which is the point I am going to discuss in just a moment, that
this Court has recognized and the Fourteenth Amendment recog~
n izes that there are principally the Federal Government and
the states.

There are two sovereignties.
However, the fact that the sovereignty of the

Indians is not a full sovereignty to the extent that the

65
Federal Government possesses sovereignty or the states possess
sovereignty does not seem to me to settle the question of
whether the sovereignty that they have is so thin that it
does not cover this type of thing.
QUESTION:

Well, it leaves it open, does it not?

I mean, you concede that it is not a full sovereignty — as
indeed, yc i must»
MR. FARR:

do concede that it is not a full

sovereignty.
QUESTION:

And the question is, then does it in­

clude, as 1 say, the power to try and convict and punish
either non-members of the Tribe or non-Indians?
MR. FARR:

That is right.

I mean, I think that

that is a question which the Court has to decide in this case.
QUESTION:

And you begin by concluding that it is

not full, so the —*
MR. FARR:

We* can see that it is not full.

We

recognize, as Chief Justice Marshall said away back.in
forcesngg. versus Georgia, that the Indian Tribes, are, to the
extent that they are sovereignties, dependent sovereignties
<

and that they are dependent upon the Federal Government, at
least if not to create their powers, not to take them away.
History and nearly two centuries of legal authority
demonstrate

that the Tribe's sovereignty is subject to the

greater screreignty of the United States and in the exercise

67
of its own sovereignty, the United States has established a
special relationship toward and a unique responsibility to
the Indians in the United States but we do agree with Peti­
tioners, Mr. Justice Stewart, that tribal sovereignty can be
and in many respects, has been circumscribed by the United
States so ;o that extent it is not a full sovereignty.
QUESTION:

Well, and also, it did not begin as

full sovereignty, did it?
MR. FARR:

Well, I think it did begin as a full —

QUESTION:

Not a territorial sovereignty, did it?

MR, FARR:

Well, it did not begin

QUESTION:

Was that not a concept, wholly alien to

Indian Tribes, the concept of territorial sovereignty?

They

were by — even those that were not nomadic did not stay right
within the meets and bounds of what is now a Reservation be­
cause there were no such things.
MR. FARR:

Is that not correct?

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

At the time before there was any Indian settlement —
QUESTION:

It was tribal self-government but it

was not territorial sovereignty was it?
MR. FARR:

Ever?

Well, in the beginning it was certainly

tribal self-government because, as you posit, they did not
have a sophisticated concept of land ownership and there was
not anybody else to govern.
QUESTION;

It was just them.

Or territorial sovereignty itself.

MR, FARR:

But that is because they did not view

territories belonging to particular individual tribes — that
is a concept to which the European settlers quickly educated
them.
QUESTION;

Correct.

MR, FARR:

Arid it is not clear to me that that

means that once they developed that understanding that their
sovereignty, because it did not depend on it at the outset,
was not sufficient to cover it, when it was developed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, you said they did not iuive a

sophisticated concept of land ownership.
QUESTION:

They did not have any.

QUESTION:

Did the United States recognize any

land ownership rights to the Indians, other than those grants
by treaty?
QUESTION:

None.

MR. FARR:

Well, no, they did not.

I think one of

the first sovereign rights that they lost, to the extent that
they would have been inclined to assert it at all, was the
right to own land as against the sovereignty of the United
States.
QUESTION:

And how did they lose that right?

MR* FARR:

I think that that is an essential part

of living, within the jurisdiction of a sovereign on which you

United Stetes exercising total jurisdiction over the territory
that theirj, what would ordinarily be a sovereign right, simply
was assumed not to exist?
MR. PARR:

I think necessarily it must»

I mean,

clearly the Indian Tribes —QUESTION Why does not the same argument apply to
the criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians?

By the same

analysis.
MR. FARR:

Because I do not think by necessary

implication that it is inconsistent with the right of the
United States to assert their own criminal jurisdiction to
assert that the Tribes can also have criminal jurisdiction,
whereas I do think that it is inconsistent necessarily with
the position of the United States as a sovereign over its lands
to say that the Indians could contract or make treaties with
foreign countries, could lease cut their lands for a naval
base of a foreign country so I do not think there is a neces­
sary inconsistency in this case.
As the result of these positions, we do believe it
is necessary, in order to resolve these cases, to examine —
a- the Court unsually has to do in Indian cases — the rele­
vant statutes and treaties in accordance with the principles
of sovereignties just discussed.
At the same time we -ask that the Court keep in mind

J

70
established rules of statutory construction that again are
repeated :.n all Indian cases, that, where the statutes and
treaties are ambiguous, that they should not be construed to
the Indians 5 detriment.

✓

Now, with regard to the present cases , the particu­
lar treaty provision at issue is the Treaty of Point Elliott
and the particular statute,, in our opinion, is 18 U.S.C. 1152
which comes at the end of a long line of similar statutes.
How, we find in that treaty, in that statute, no
clear expression of Congressional intent to cut off tribal
jurisdiction entirely ir, every instance where non-Indians
have committed a crime.
At best, we can find some provisions that seem am­
biguous, that are suspect, that can be interpreted, as Peti­
tioners and the State of Washington have done, to support one
conclusion or the other but we find no clear statement, such as
W3 think is required by the principles of statutory construc­
tion that this Court has laid down,,
QUESTION:

Well, when you say there is no intention

to cut rt off, you have to, first of all, have convinced your­
self and us that it existed beforehand.
MR. FARR:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And nothing you have said so far has

indicated that to me.
MR. FARR:

Well, I have, as I suppose, given my

71
bast shot,

I mean, I think that the case •— the authorities

we cite in our brief and the position we take is apparent
there and 1 believe that that sovereignty exists and it does
cover that point.
QUESTION:

Well, there was limited sovereignty

but there is no case in this Court where that sovereignty
included the power, was there, to try and punish for a criminal
offense, a non-Indian?
MR. FARR:

The Court has not said. that.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FARR:

That is true, but if that sovereignty

does not ersist to some extent, it is difficult to explain to
begin with, where the Indians get the sovereignty over their
own members.

That has not been conferred by anything in

particular,
QUESTION:

Well, that is tribal.

QUESTION:

But this; band peti­

MR. FARR:

But the Court has said that they are not

The opinion of the Court

ia Masnrle said that, that they are something far more than
tnat and that they have a unique position which is not that of

I believe they probably

could do so, at least to govern themselves by a voluntary
organization•
Fourth, and just completing our submission on this
general point, we do not. believe that Public Law 2 30 consti­
tutes a bar to assertion of tribal jurisdiction in this case.
Now, we have discussed this briefly in our brief
h -re and we have also alluded to it in our Amicus memorandum
in the- Yak:.ma Nation case which we filed late last week.
Although we recognize that Congress, in Public Law
2BO, has extended to the rights the opportunity to assert
jurisdiction over the Indian Tribes, we do not believe that
the assertion by the State of Washington is valid and therefore
it would not reach to this case,
Nov/, in the few moments remaining I would just like

73

to say a brief word about the practical effects of Indian
jurisdiction.

Although we do not underestimate the possible

difficulties, we do not believe that the result will be the
catastrophe that the Petitioners in the State of Washington
seem to predict.
We do not believe it is an extraordinary notion
that Indians would have a right to protect themselves against
crimes committed by other persons ~QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, could I ask you —

MR. FARR:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

— why does not Indian sovereignty, the

tribal sovereignty, extend to the prosecution of felonies?
MR. FARR:

It. does not extend to 'the prosecution of

felonies at this time because the Indian Civil Rights Act has
limited the punishment which the Indian Tribes can mete out to
six months
QUESTION:

Sc you are saying there is a federal

statute which cuts back the sovereignty?

Thera is a federal statute that cuts

MR. FARR:

I think encompassed within the notion of

tribal sovereignty is the fact that if a non-Indian came on

the Reservation and killed an Indian that they could have tried
him if the Federal Government had not taken that away.
QUESTION:

of an Indian.
QUESTION:

Sc- that in the killing of a non-Indian,

the tribal sovereignty that existed has been taken away?

You

would say.
MR. FARR:

In the killing of the non-Indian, the

tribal sovereignty — to the extent that

it existed there is

an open question and that is as to whether Indian interests
are sitificiently connected to that.

ereignty involved but to the extent that there was any

One was for speeding or reckless driving and ;he

would the Indian courts have had jurisdiction?
MR. FARR:

I believe, as I read the facts in this

case, that; they would have, that speeding through an Indian
Reservation is —
QUESTION:

Well, suppose Belgarde, instead of being

driving had just mugged another non-Indian on the Reservation?
MR. FARR:

I believe that would be covered by

I may ask just one other question,

putting aside all the statutes for a moment and going back to
what the Tribe retained as its original concept of

if I understand your position correctly, you do

not contend that they originally retained the power to try for
major crimes.
MR. FARR:
that.

I

Wo, I believe that our position is not

try for major crimes

if they had the sovereign power to

protect themselves and their members from anything.

Indians for major crimes?

They lost that in the Indian Civil

Now, there is no ques-

They never exercised it, though.

That is right.

QUESTION:

That is correct.

yes.
And the Indian Civil

Rights Act did not take away from them the power to punish
for major crimes, it just said you cannot sentence a person,
convicted of first degree murder for more than six months.
HR. FARR:

That is correct.

It defines it in terms

of punishment and not the actual crime but I think that both

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
\

SLADE GORTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON
GENERAL GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I trust that you have, noted how extraordinary that
presentation of the United States is, that until 1968 this
Indian Tr:.be could have hung1

a non-Indian for burglary

but

without offering him any constitutional rights whatsoever.
I ’think I do want to speak very briefly on the
technical, .y aofc-quite relevant facts about whether this —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gorton, before 1968, the State

of Waoninguon could have

hung an Indian or a white man without

offering him any constitutional rights at all, could it not?
Tnere was no 'Fourteenth Amendment.
GENERAL GORTON:
QUESTION:

Before 1968?

Yes.

GENERAL GORTON:

That may be correct.

There war at

least a Constitution under those circumstances for the state
and during: those year?- pre-1968 this Tribe had no Constitution,
either.

-here ware not even Indian constitutional rights but

t.uoy «:re claiming, the United States’ submission is that

78
Indian jurisdiction or, rather, yes, that the Indian tribal
jurisdiction on this Reservation over non-Indians, except
under the HcBrafcney Exception, was plenary and was not derived
from the Constitution.

It was not subject to constitutional

guarantees,
Here, the Respondent has constantly made the point
of what a terrible situation will exist as far as the enforce­
ment of the law on this Reservation is concerned unless they
are allowed to try these cases.
They fail to tell you that they have objected
vociferously and consistently to any exercise of state juris­
diction under Public Lav 280,

At this point, unless you hear

an appeal on it, they have successfully objected to that juris­
diction.
On the one hand they are saying the state should
come and enforce its lavs on the Reservation and on the other,
when we try to do so, they are saying that you can't cone and
enforce your lav; on the Reservation.
The cure to that situation is extraordinarily
simple,

Even if they are correct in their position on Public

Law 280, the Indian Civil Rights Act gives them the power to
ask the state to fake jurisdiction, total or limited, or- that
Reservation.
Our state has already deputized other tribal police
officers on Reservations such as the Yakima who have the

79

authority to make arrests for the violation of state laws.
Therefore, they do not need a genealogical chart

in order

to
QUESTION:

Does the 280 question — that question

relates to Indians and non-Indians alike, I take it.
GENERAL GORTON:

Yes.

No, that question relates

primarily to jurisdiction over Indians.
QUESTION:

Now

I take it now you do not say now that

the Indian Tribe does not have power to try
GENERAL GORTON:
QUESTION:

I do not.

But do you say the state does?

GENERAL GORTON:
QUESTION:

Indians?

I am sorry?

Do you say the state has concurrent power

to try Indians?
GENERAL GORTON:

Whether the state power has concurrent

power to try Indians depends on the validity of Public Law
2 30.,

That is a separate case which we have asked
QUESTION:

That question is raised in the Yakima

case.
GENERAL GORTON:
QUESTION:

And now in the Ninth Circuit decision —

GENERAL GORTCN:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is in the Yakima case.

We do not.

— you fio not.

GENERAL GORTON:

That Is quite correct.

Finally, to state the proposition that the state

80
and local authorities have no interest in providing law
enforcement authority for 3,000 of their own

voting citizens

on this Reservation — or perhaps for 25,000 potential voting
citizens on a Reservation someplace in Montana

is nonsense.

Of course the county has exactly the same interest
in the enforcement of tie law

in this area as it does in any

other srea in that county.
Mr. Justice Stevens asked a question of counsel as
to the situation of the Indian secant in 1350 after the Oregon
Territory hat but before any Indian treaties were signed.
Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe, could have asked a
much broader question and received the same answer.
Now, under the submission of the Tribes, the
Indiana would have had. the right to seek out that scout at
any place :.n the Oregon Territory and tried him for any
asserted violation of this code whatsoever because of this
doctrine of retained sovereignty.
We say there are at least two grounds under which
the answer is no to that question.
The Indians simply did not retain that sovereignty
under

:he way in which sovereignty is considered by the

United States.

As of 1846, by the time of the completion of

the Treaty with Great Britain, the sovereignty of the United
States over that territory, of the United States was total.
When t.ao United States, in the Oregon Treaty

81

Statuta, sought to preserve rights of Indians, it

did not

talk about some kind of retained sovereignty, it said that we
will not take away their rights, their personal or property
rights except by treaty.
Again I say, it is absurd to think that the United
States blithely left all of the settlers who were moving into
that territory to the plenary jurisdiction of

the Indians

under those circumstances until they could reduce them — but
reduce them geographically only — to a set of Reservations.
That simply is not consistent with the history of the United
States.
Thank you very much.
QUESTIONS

May I ask you, Mr. Attorney General,

is the Suquamish Reservation part of the historic area in which
the

Tribe lived or is it different?
GENERAL GORTON:

The answer to that question is

clearly no because the Suquamish Tribe did not exist —
QUESTION:

Right.

GENERAL GORTCN:

— until Governor Stevens came out

there and organized it as a political unit in order tc sign a
treaty with it.
QUESTION:

So that the area •—* the Reservation area

is one --GENERAL GORTON:

82
QUESTION:

And it is not one as to which the Tribe

had any Indian title originally?
GENERAL GORTON:

Well, there was no Tribe before

Governor Stevens created it in order to sign this treaty.

The

particular — some of the particular Indians who were later
denominated Suquamish may very well have lived in this area.
QUESTION:

That is what I want to know.

Did they

live in this area?
GENERAL GORTON:

They may have.

It is very

difficult ;.o tell at this point.
