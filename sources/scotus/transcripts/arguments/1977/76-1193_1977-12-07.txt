MR. CHIEF JUSTICE RURCER;

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 76-1193, United States against Estelle Jacobs,
also known as "Mrs„ Kramer."
Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on the Court’s grant, of the
Government's

petition for a writ of certiorari to review

the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, suppressing Respondent's Grand Jury testimony
as evidenced in the trial of a two-count indictment charging
her with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce and
with' perjury before the Grand Jury.
Respondent was employed as a skip tracer by several
bill collection agencies that subsequently became a focus
of Grand Jury investigation.
On one occasion she called the brother of an
L. u.;-viutial who had incurred gambling debts on a junket to
Puerto Rico and had not paid them.

In this call which,

unbeknownst to her, the brother recorded, she threatened the
debtor■s life if the debt were not promptly paid.
In June, 1974, Respondent was subpoenaed to

4
appear and did appear before a Grand Jury being conducted by
an attorney from the Department of Justice Strike Force who
was specially assigned from Washington for the purpose of
conducting an investigation that encompassed Respondent * s
activities„
Respondent, when she appeared, was given advice
of her privilege against self "incrimination, and was also
advised that she could consult with an attorney if she felt
the need to do so at any time and was warned about the
seriousness of the offense of perjury and the penalties
therefor.
She was not expressly told that she was a target
of the Grand Jury’s investigation.
Now, during the course of the questioning of
Respondent about her employer’s business and her own activi­
ties therein, the Government attorney read to her from a
transcript of the threatening conversations had with the
debtor's brother and she unequivocally denied having made
any of the statements

contained therein.

She was not told of the existence of the recording
of this conversation.
Respondent was thereafter indicted for the substan­
tive threat and for the falsa testimony to the Grand Jury
denying the threatening conversation.

She moved the District

Gourfc to suppress her Grand Jury testimony, relying on the

5

lower court decisions in United States against Handujano

and

United States against Washington» which in one instance had
suppressed Grand Jury testimony for failure to give full
Miranda warnings and in another, for failure to give target
warnings to a putative defendant»
The Government appealed

and the Court of Appeals

affirmed the suppression ruling although

on grounds of super­

visory power rather than on tfie basis of any finding of
constitutional violation *
In reaching its decision, the Court followed a
rather unusual practice of making written inquiries of all
United States attorneys in the circuit to learn their policies
with regard to the administration of target warnings and
having beer;, advised that it was their policy to administer
such warnings, the Court upheld suppression for the stated
reason of achieving uniformity in the criminal procedure in
this circuit.
The United States petitioned this Court for a
v-/x it ox. certiorari, which was granted and the case was
remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light
of this Court’s reversati in Mandnjano.
On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its
..■eo is ion.

It found aR occasion to depart from its prior

ruling because of this Court’s decision in Mandujano since
the suppression ruling in that case had been predicated on a

6
supposed

violation of the Defendant's constitutional rights;

whereas hare, the Court found that none of Respondent's rights
had been violated.
The Court thought its suppression order was justi­
fied as a remedy to ensure that various prosecutors follow
uniform practices.
In a striking self-contradiction, th€: Court stated
that its remedy was a one-time ad hoc sanction intended to
let our citizens know that equal justice is available to all.
The Court indicated that it felt comfortable in
pursuing its didactic purpose of teaching the prosecutor a
lesson in this case because, in its view7, the prosecutor
was not entitled to the luxury of a perjury count, as to
which the Court was effectively pardoning Respondent, when
there remained the substantive count upon which prosecution
of Respondent was still possible.
QUESTION;

What does the word "didactic" mean?

MR. FREYs

I assume it means educational teaching.

QUESTION %

Thank you.

MR. FREY:

x

811 mention that the substantive pro­

secution was impaired, although to a far-lesser degree, by
the suppression of Respondent's —
QUESTION:

Was this the educational function of

the Court of Appeals as distinguished from its supervisory
function?

7
MR. FREY;

I suppose I view the two as being

QUESTION:

Perhaps the two conjoin at times.

QUESTION:

If they had used the word "supervisor"

combined.

instead of that, you still would be here,
MR. FREY:

We would be here.

QUESTION:

That is right,

MR. FREY;

Of course.

The focal question in this case is the power of
the Court of Appeals to apply the remedy of suppression to
a defendant's Grand Jury testimony as a means of teaching
the Executive Branch the lesson that it must achieve unifor­
mity of prcsecutorial practices and secondly, assuming some
such power exists, the soundness of the Court's exercise of
that power in the circumstances of this case.
2 think it is best if I begin by making clear what
we are not contending and what the Court need not decide in
this case.
First, we are not contending that uniformity of
pre secutoria1 practice is undesirable.

It is the hope of

the Department fo Justice that similarly-situated persons
will be to the extent feasible, similarly treated by federal
prosecutors although I think it must be recognized that
there are so many different individual prosecutors handling
so many different matters of such somplexity that actually

uniformity in practice necessarily remains a goal
QUESTION:

Especially when a man from Washington

comes into it.
MR. FREY:

That, the Court of Appeals was disturbed

by that aspect of the case.

That is true.

Second, we are not here today to argue that target
warnings are undesirable as a matter of policy.

Indeed, the

Court of appeals itself did not assert in this case that
target warnings should be given.

It said that the Department

of Justice would be equally free to require target warnings
or to prohibit them if it wished to, as long as the practice
followed is uniform.
Thirdly, this Court need not decide whether the
courts generally would have the power to adopt the rule
prospectively, which would require

the administration of any

particular kind of warnings in the Grand Jury.
While I have serious doubts that such rules would
be properly promulgated by a panel of the Court of Appeals,
the issue lore is not the power to establish such rules as
a part of the Court5s control over the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. Frey, there is quite an

oversupply of former U.S. Attorneys on the Second Circuit.
Do you know how many there are there?
MR. FREY:
the moment.

I am not sure hoxv many there are, at

9

QUESTION:

Well, there are quite a few.

I meanf

they are not dealing in something they do not know about.
MR. FREY:

I do not believe that the three judges

on this panel included any former United States Attorneys.
QUESTION:

I am talking about the whole Court.

MR. FREY:

Well* I am not — I will get to soma

things that I think they did not understand a little later
in my argument about the prosecutorial practices..
In any event, I was trying to make the point that
the Court does not have to decide here the question of the
existence of power as an aspect of the power of the Court
over the Grand Jury.

Rather, the question here is the power

of the Court to impose the remedy of suppressior in the
absence of any court-made or statutory rule that the prose­
cutor has violated.
The suppression of Respondent's Grand Jury testi­
mony in this case represents, I submit, a wholly unprece­
dented exercise of judicial supervisory power and we have
educed :.n oar brief a number of independent grounds for
concluding that this exercise of supervisory power was
erroneous.
Now, first of

all, no one disputes that the judi­

cial supervisory power may be circumscribed by Congress.

I

io not think the Court disputed that.
In part one of our brief we have argued that two

10

statutes, Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and 18 USC
3501 deprive the courts of the remedy of suppressing rele­
vant evidence, especially if the evidence consists of a
statement by the defendant,
1 intend to rely on our brief with regard to these
points and pass on here to our argument that, apart from any
statutory restrictions on the supervisory power, the Court
of Appeals5 exercise of it was improper.
Now, first we can compare, I think, what the
Court of Appeals did here with any other past exercise of
supervisory power by this Court or, indeed, by ether federal
courts of appeals and we can see that there are some striking
differences.
The cases on which Respondent relies and on which
the Court relied by and large involve the exercise of super­
visory power over the conduct of the trial itself.

That is

rifch regard to such matters as voire dire questioning of
prospective jurors, conformity to rules of evidence pro­
ceedings, regularity in sentencing practice, rules of evi­
dence, rules regarding instruction of juries, the Allen
charge, those kinds of matters.
We do not for a moment question that these kinds
of rules ara inherently necessary as a part of the supervisory
powers of the Appellate Court over the conduct of the District
Court and except, of coarse, to the extent any statute

11
imposes restrictions»
We do not think that helps to justify the result
that the Court of Appeals reached here.
The only significant case, it seems to me, which
involves something outside of the trial context itself is the
McNabb case which, of course, is the famous instance in which
the pcfice violated the defendants’ rights for a prompt pre­
sentation to the magistrate and the court found that that
violation justified the application of an exclusionary rule
excluding the defendant!; confession.
Now, there are a couple of important differences
between McNabb and the present case.

The first and most sig­

nificant is that the probable basis for the Court's power in
McNabb, which was the power to make common-law rules of
evidence in accordance with reason and which was codified ip.
former Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, has
been abolished with the adoption of the Federal Rules of
evidence which is a fresh codification and which. I think
takes away the supervisory power over evidence that may
' previously have existed.
The second distinction between McNabb and the
present case is that in McNabb there was a flagrant violation
of an existing statutory right of the defendant and it was
as a means of enforcing this right of the Defendant that the
lourt acted.

12
Nov/,, here there was no right.

The Respondent had

no right to a target warning according to the Court of
Appeals.

There was simply an irregularity in the practice,

a departure from an informal departmental or U„S. Attorney
policy involved.

We think that is a very substantial differ­

ence from McNabb.
Now, I respectfully suggest that the assertion of
supervisory power here over proseciitorial conduct that did
not violate Respondent’s constitutional or statutory rights
is undisciplined and is intrusive on the proper allocation of
judicial and executive responsibilities.
What the Court of Appeals was doing here was, in
fact, exercising a Chancellors foot veto over law enforcement
practices of which it disapproved, something that this Court,
in turn, specifically disapproves of.
QUESTION:

Do you include in that, Mr. Frey, that

it trespasses on the rule-making power of this Court through
the judicial conference processes?
MR. FREY:

Well --

QUESTION:

In other words, would such a rule be

an appropriate rule as part of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure?
MR. FREY:

Well, the rule that target warnings

must be administered, if that were the rule, would be a
perfectly appropriate rule, preferably adopted by Act of

13

Congress or by amendment to the rules of criminal procedure,
which involves this Court, the Advisory Committee and the
concurrence of Congress.
The rule that prosecutors must act uniformly, we
don't care how as long as it is uniform, seems to me would
be difficult to include in the rules of criminal procedure.
QUESTION:

No, I am speaking of the

specific

rule that was laid down by the supervisory power here.

Is

that within the rule-making power of this Court through the
judicial conference under the statute?
MR. FREY:

Yes.

Well, I have no difficulty, if

such a statute were adopted through the rule-making power
V'

of this Court, I would have no difficulty with coherence to
that statute although it would still be a question as to the
proper remedy for a violation.

QUESTION:

It would have to be a statute.

QUESTION:

I wonder if you are giving up too much?

you?

Brady rules, —
QUESTION :

I am talking about —

MR. FREY;

— the Jenks Act.

QUESTION;

Yes, but not by the Court without the

benefit of rule or statute.

You wouldn't want to give that

up, would you?
MR. FREYs

Well, X am not sure.

For purposes of

this case certainly 1 am prepared — I do not think the
Court need decide whether, let’s say, the District Court
could adopt, such a rule or even the judicial council of the
Circuit, acting under Section 332D could adopt such a rule,
as has been done in connection with speedy trial, rules.
These are, I think, difficult philosophical ques­
tions but ere not at all necessary to get into to resolve
this case.
QUESTION:

But Mr. Frey, are we talking about a

rule requiring the giving of target warnings or a rule re­
quiring that, evidence be excluded if target warnings are
not given?

I think you ara talking about —
MR. FREY:

tinction.

I think that is a very pertinent dis­

As 1 suggested in response to the Chief Justice,

even if there were such a rule, it would not follow that the
remedy would be exclusion.
QUESTION:

And your view, as I understand your

brief, is that the Court would not. have the power to exclude

15
the evidence, even if it adopted such a rule.

It could not

enforce the rule by using the exclusion power to exclude
evidence under your reading of the rule of evidence.
MR. FREY:
on the

Well, our brief is essentially premised

non-existence

of any such rule outside of whatever

rule one might discern in prosecutorial practices.

We would

have a different case if there were a rule adopted either in
the rules of criminal procedure or adopted by a particular
district court.
QUESTION:
your brief.

I just want to be sure I understood

Even assume that a district court or a court of

appeals or this court adopted a rule saying prosecutors must
gr'.ve target warnings .

It would not follow from that that we

could adopt a further rule saying that if target, warnings are
not given, evidence may be excluded.
MR. FREY:

That would not necessarily follow, Your

In fact, your position is that we could

not adopt an exclusionary rule to enforce such a prosecutorial

MR. FREY:

Yes, I'm sorryP I was —

QUESTION:

Your argument on the statute is we

could not police the rule in effect, even though we could
adopt it.
MR. FREY:

Well, if it were adopted by the mechan­

ism suggested by the Chief Justice, it would be by statute or
by rule adopted under statutory authority which is what -QUESTION:

Yes,- but if the rule adopted is merely

one saying that the prosecutor must give target warnings,
that still would not enable the court to include evidence
obtained by failing to give target warning.
MR. FREY:

Well, I think that insofar as the

rule is based on our statutory arguments, or the issue here
is based or. our statutory arguments, you would have to find
a rule that, was violated and we are not. suggesting that if a
constitutional right or a statutory rule or a rule adopted
by this Court pursuant to statutory authority had bean vio­
lated, the Court would necessarily be without the power, as
in McNarb, to adopt some kind of an exclusionary rule.
We think it should not even than because -—
QUESTION:

Well, how could we have the power if

the statute means what you say it means?

As

I read your

brief, you are saying Rule 432 now deprives all federal
<: ourfcs of any power to adopt a rule excluding relevant
evidence unless the evidentiary rule is compelled by statute

17

or the Constitution.
Maybe I misread your brief, but I think that is
what you have argued.
If that is not your argument, I do not understand
your Rule 402 argument and I hope you will explain it to me.
MR. FREY;

Well. I think you are probably right

that that is our argument.
ever.

We have a number of steps, how­

My point is that even if you were to disagree with

the conclusions that Rule 402 is an absolute bar, it seems
to me that Rule 402 requires the admission of evidence unless
there is an underlying violation of Constitutional statute.
In other words, Rile 402 does not, I think, over­
rule the Weeks-Mapp exclusionary rule.
that it does that.
QUESTION:

I am not suggesting

I do not know that Congress does.
One further question because I really

/ant to be sure I understand it.

Assume an identification

iroblem in say, those cases where there is a question of
whether evidence should be excluded because identification
procedure in the station was improper -- a line-up case.
Now, is it the Government's view that that, evi­
dence could not be — the federal courts could not adopt an
exclusionary rule for the federal system that is different
rrora a constitutional rule they might impose upon the states?
- do not know if I make my question clear.
MR. FREY:

Well, 1 think that is right.

Of course,

18

there is a specific statute covering line-up identification,
so I assume you are not ~QUESTION;

Well, I am just thinking of any example

Does the Court have any discretion with respect to super­
vising federal courts that is different in terms of admissi­
bility of evidence that is dif£e.rent from its power over
state courts?
MR. FREY;

You mean, apart from all the discretion

that is provided in other parts of the Federal Rules of
Evidence such as the discretion to weigh prejudicial effect
against probative value in tie discretion and the hearsay
exception?

I mean, there is much discretion which is vested

by the evidentiary code in courts to make evidentiary rulings
We don3* question the existence of that discretion.
QUESTION;

This does not include the power to

exclude because it wants to, in effect, require the police
to follow a certain practice or something like that.
MR. FREY:

No, I don't think it does.

Unless

Congress could not constitutionally abolish it.
QUESTION:

If we read 402 literally, the power to

snforce exclusion rests exclusively in the Constitution or
::he Congress.

Or through the rule-making power and no indi­

vidual judge and no collection of individual judges could
impose such a rule, unless that 402 does not mean what it
nays.

19
MR. FREYj

I think that is right.

You would have

to find that the exclusionary rule was derived either express­
ly or by implication from the Constitution, from the statute
or from the rule of procedure.
QUESTIONS

Well, all the rules of evidence that

the courts have developed down through the years prior to the
codification of the rules have been replaced.
MR. FREY:

I think that is right, by the federal,

by the code,
QUESTION:

Mo court is any longer free to follov?

a rule that it used to follow if it is inconsistent with the
federal rules.
J

MR. FREY:
evidence.

If it is inconsistent with, the rules of

I think that is right and in fact, the rules of

evidence abolished the part of Rule 26 or the rules of
criminal procedure that previously had conferred that power
the courts so I do not see that that is a serious problem.
QUESTION:

Then, why does not 402 then invalidate

the rule of Weeks against the United States?
MR. FREY:

Well, my suggestion is that if a rule

is constitutionally compelled and I assume that the rule of
ffeeks against the uni.ted States must be constitutionally
compelled today in light of Mapp —
•QUESTION:

But not .in light of Weeks.

MR. FREY:

I understand that.

20

QUESTION:

Or in light of

Elkins.

MR. FREY:

I think Elkins is overruled by the rules

of evidence.
QUESTION:

McNabb?

MR. FREY:

I think McNabb is overruled.

It is

separately overruled by 3501,
QUESTION:

3501 overrules —

MR. FREY:

But I tie an, we are relying on two

statutes, each of which we suggest independently takes away
the power the Court might previously have had prior to the
enactment cf those statutes.
In any event, to return to the question apart from
the statutes of what is a proper exercise of judicial super­
visory power, I suggest that the Chancellor's foot veto
that was condemned in Russell

is even more inappropriate in

the case of supervising a prosecutor's conduct than it is in
supervising police conduct in entrapment situations.
Now, in this connection the words of the Chief
Justice as a circuit judge in Newman against the United Statas
are singularly apposite and Z think worth quoting here:
The Chief Justice said, "An attorney for the
United States, as any other attorney, appears in a dual role,
Re is at once an officer of the court and the agent and
attorney for a client.
,r In the first capacity, he is responsible to the

21
court for the manner of his conduct of the case.

That is,

his demeanor, deportment and ethical conduct.
"But in his second capacity as an agent and attor­
ney for the executive, he is responsible to his principle and
the courts have no power over the exercise of his discretion
or his motives as they relate to the execution of his duties
within the framework of his professional employment.
"To say that every United States Attorney must
literally treat every offensa and every offender alike is to
delegate him an impossible task.

Of course, this concept

would negate discretion."
Jlnd now, this is an important point.
"It is assumed that the United States Attorney
will perform his duties and exercise his powers consistent
with his oaths and while this discretion is subject to abuse

or misuse, just as is judicial discretion, deviations from
iis duty as an agent of the executive are to be dealt with

oy his superiors,"
dow, in this case I want to reiterate that there
is no suggestion here of any deliberate impropriety by the
Strike Force Attorney or any departure from a statute or rule

or even a published policy or policy of general application,
This was, at most, a negligent mistake on his

part.
.'ted now I would like to come back to a point that

22
I mentioned earlier in connection with the wisdom of the
courts

attempting to enforce upon the prosecutors policies

and that is, that courts can often make mistakes, that per­
haps the Executive Branch with regard to its own pplicy
would not make.
On page 5a of the Appendix to the petition in the
Court of Appeals second opinion in this case, they relied
upon the guidelines involving the relationship between the
Strike Force and the United States Attorney and they invoked
the guideline that says,

"When

a

specific investigation

has progressed to the point where there is to be: a nresenta*tion for an indictment, the chief of the Strike Force shall
then for this purpose operate under the direction of the
United States Attorney who shall oversee the judicial phase
of the case«. "
Now., my understanding is, contrary to the Court
of Appeals understanding, that what that means is that the
Srike Force attorney is on his own until he is ready to pre­
sent the case for an indictment and that the conduct of the
investigation in the Grand Jury is not under the direct
control of the United States Attorney in this sense.

It is

only when ha decides to indict that he comes to the United
States Attorney for the authority and the United States
Attorney takes over.
Now, I do not rely on that point for anything more

23

than to show that when courts gat outside what seems to me
to be their legitimate domain, they are in danger of making
mistakes.
QUESTION:

Well, what is that statement about not

forgetting what you know as men?
MR. FREY:

Excuse me?

QUESTION;

Not forgetting what you know as men,

even though you are a judge.
MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You

MR. FREY;

Yes.

QUESTION;

Justice Frankfurter.

remember Lane against Wilson?

/

Well, I am saying,

these former prosecutors know and you and I know that there
has always been some tension between Strike Forces in Washin­
gton and government lawyers —
MR.- FREY:

Well, quite obviously the court did

not like the idea of —
#

, QUESTION:
point at all,

I do not think you should press your

I think you should recognize it.

MR. FREY:

oh, no, I — 2, of course, understand

that.
Now, in terms of the didactic effect on future
prosecutorial conduct, I suggest that what the Court has
done here may have exactly the reverse of what was intended
because what they have done is, they have discouraged — to

24
the extent they were relying on what they perceived to be a
uniform prosecutorial rule or practice and punishing us for a
departure from that practice, they are encouraging us not to­
ad opt such practices since what is implicit in the decision
of the Executive Branch to adopt a practice like this is the
Executive Branch's expectation that it could enforce the
practice.

It can decide how

important that practice is and

what sanctions are appropriate.
QUESTION:

Is there anything to prevent the

Attorney General of the United States from repealing and
revoking that practice in the Second Circuit or any other
U. 3, Attorney's office tomorrow?
MR. FREY:

No.

He, of course, could do so but I

think it is more likely that he would do just the opposite
and possibly require target warnings as a matter of practice
but not with the intention that the courts can —
QUESTION:

And then, I was thinking purely of

MR. FREY:

He has the power and the Court of

power,

Appeals did not contest that power,
QUESTION:

And he allows — the Attorney General

has traditionally allowed variations in practices among
various districts in order to encourage experimentation.

Is

that not so?
MR. FREY:

That is so and it seems to me that is

25
one permissible approach, that this is not a matter in which
there is any external requirement that there foe a uniform
rule or that it is so important that the courts are justified
in stepping in and saying there has to be one.
QUESTION:

The Second Circuit, at least at one

time or perhaps the Southern District exhibits all Grand Jury
evidence which very few, if any other districts do.
Is that still so?
MR. FREY:

I am not —

QUESTION:

It is not that material but I merely

suggest that — that variations —
MR. FREY:

There are.,

There are variations.

I

wanted to make two more points very briefly if I may, before
my time expires.
One is that to compare the exclusionary rule which
the Court has, in effect, applied in this case with the Fourth
Amendment Exclusionary Rule and to point out that there are
some significant differences here.
The most important is that in Mapp ac-ainst Ohio,
the Court said, in effect, "We have no way to control the
conduct of the police.

The only way we can make the police

respect the peoples’ constitutional rights is by imposing the
sanction that we have at hand and that sanction is exclusion
cf evidence and we hope by the employment of that sanction
that we will accomplish the

salutary objectives of conformity

26

of police conduct to the requirements of the law.
Now, in this case we are dealing with prosecutors.
If the Court announces a rule that target warnings should be
given if it feels that appropriate -- and let's assume it
has the power, what reason is there to suppose that prosecu­
tors will deliberately violate that rule with such consis­
tency that exclusion of evidence is necessary or that if they
do violate that rule, the Court does not have in its hands a
simple remedy of direct discipline against the prosecutor?
So the situation is very different.
Now, in closing, let me point to %^hat seems tc me
to be the quintessential irony of the Court of Appeals' ruling
here.

In its seal to insure uniformity of prosecutorial

practice, the Court has indicated that it will engage in
apparently sporadic, haphazard imposition of penalties on
prosecutors; not in all cases under some identifiable stan­
dards but from time to time when it feels it necessary to
teach the prosecutor a lesson.
/.

They have sought to arm themselves with the Sword

of Damocles to wield as they wish from time to time.

In

effect, equal justice in the courts is foresworn in favor of
supervision over the prosecutor’s activities, a supervision
that ought, in principle, to be exercised by the Executive
3ranch itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Prey, may I ask one question before

27
you sit down?

I understand, of course, you challenge the

exercise of discretion in this case and you rely on Rule 402
of the Federal Rules of Evidence
bility.

in Section 3501 on admissi­

If we were to assume for the moment that 402 and

3501, neither of those was controlling, would you concede
that apart from those restrictions, the Court of Appeals had
the power to do what it did in this case?
MR. FREY:

Well, I -— let me put it this way;

The

Court of Appeals, whether it had the power is a matter for
review by this Court.

This Court can — I don't know, I mean,

as a philosophical matter, if this Court says it. is improper
to apply the

remedy of suppression under these circumstances,

I do not know whether the Court of Appeals has the power in
some sense to do that or not.
QUESTION:

In other words, whatever their super­

visory power may be, it is subject to the supervisory power
of this Court?
MR. FREY:
,-o it,

Definitely.

And if you say they cannot

-hen, in a sense, they do not have the power.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Seidman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING P. SEIDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SEIDMAN:
-he Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and if it please

28

Mr. Frey has most reasonably stated the underlying
factual pattern in this case.

However, whether it be from

the standpoint of the legal issues or the philosophy underlying the legal issues, I believe that the thrust of the ar­
gument has failed to address the problem.
I do not believe this case involves an instance
where the Appellate Court seeks to direct the prosecutor in
what he must or must not say and 1 believe the underlying
opinion of the Court of Appeals expressly states that if the
prosecutor wishes, or the Attorney General wishes, they need
not, as the; law is presently constituted, give any type of
warning.
I believe what the Court of

Appeals was con­

cerned about and what I was initially concerned about as the
defense counsel in this matter who brings ten years of having
been a prosecutor as a background to this type of case, was
the conduct that would be taking place before an arir of the
court, to wit, the Grand Jury.
I heard many questions of Mr. Frey which seemed to
address the problem as to whether or not this was a chancel­
lor's veto of the Executive Branch of Government concerning
what was or was not to be said to a witness who is a pros­
pective defendant before a Grand Jury.
1 submit to you that that is not the question,
that is not the thrust of the Court of Appeals decision in

29
this case.

I believe what the Court was concerned about and

is concerned with and properly concerned with is that the
Grand Jury, which is an arm of the Court and not of the Exe­
cutive Branch of Government, was being used in a manner that
it

determined required its action within the scope of its

supervisory power.
And again I wish to reiterate that the Court in
its second opinion as well as in its first opinion indicated
that the prosecutor could adopt any policy he wished concer­
ning the granting of any warning to any prospective defendant
so therefore, to seek to have this case revolve around a
contest between the exercise of executive power and the exer­
cise of judicial power, I believe begs the question and fails
to identify it properly.
QUESTION:

But however you define it,

it consti­

tutes a command to the United States Attorney and all the
United States Attorneys in the Second Circuit, does it not?
MR. SEIDMAN:
not.

I respectfully believe that it does

Number one, Your Honor, this Court —
QUESTION:

Wall, it imposes a sanction if he does

not comply with the order, does it not?
MR. SEXOMAN:
ca^e. Your Honor.

It only imposes sanction in this

I believe the Court was explicit in its

articulation of the legal pr uiciple concerning the exercise
of its supervisory power that A, this was not a general

30
principle to be applied in all cases, that it held considered
particularly this fact pattern which involved the situation
of the court's Grand Jury — the people!s Grand Jury, not the
prosecutor's

Grand Jury and what takes place before it and

Mr. Justice Marshall indicated that many members of the bench
that relate to this problem may be gentlemen who have prose­
cutorial background and I believe that if that is the case,
that it was important to the consideration of this case be­
cause any jurist, I submit most respectfully, who has not
logged

time in a Grand Jury as a prosecutor does not know

the omnipotent power that the prosecutor has in that room
concerning the witness and what takes place to it.
I submit to this Court that as a practical matter
the Grand Jury is a non-functioning body which constitutes a
rubber stamp for the prosecutor.
Therefore, what control, if any, can the Court have
over the conduct of prosecutors before Grand Juries when the
Court is net there?

The only one who is before the Grand

Jury happens to be the 23 jurors who are fundamentally mute
in the process that ultimately evolves, other than determining,,
hopefully, whether an indictment is warranted, the prosecutor
and the witness.
As a matter of fact, I do not believe that there is
even a statutory requirement that all of the colloquy that
takes .place in a Grand Jury be transcribed and therefore very

i

31
often, as may be the case in this case, the colloquy that does
take place is selected, assumed for good reason by the prosecutor and thus what appears before the Court -QUESTION:

Are notes taken of everything?

Whether they are transcribed or not.
MR. SEIDMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe not, Your Honor.

Is this the Southern District?

MR. SEIDMAN:

No, no, I am not suggesting — in

the Southern District there is a transcription but that tran­
scription begins and ends

this is the Eastern District.

That transcription begins and ends when at the direction of
the prosecutor there is that direction but I believe that is
a side issue in this merely to give the Court tie background
if it needs this as to what does and does not take place in
the Grand Jury,
The question, here is as to what motivated this
Court to exercise its supervisory power.
QUESTION:

Does it really have anything to do

tfith the Court’s concern about possible prosecutorial abuse
of the Grand Jury since, as I read Judge Gurfein's opinion,
so long as they do the same thing in every district, it does
lot make any difference what they do?
MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, within certain confines,

hr. Justice Rehnquist, I would agree with that statement.
QUESTION:

Then the reversal here was not based on

32

the Court of Appeals determination that this particular thinq
done by the U.S. Attorney was improper, had it been done
uniformly.
MR. SEIDMANs

What the Court did say, sir, is that

if the United States Attorneys in this circuit or the Attor­
ney General of the United States wished to adopt a rule that
no tarqet warnings were to be given, that since t:he;re is no
constitutional or statutory requirement, that it would be
possible for them not to give that type of warning.
QUESTION:

So it seems to me hard to support the

Court of Appeals decision on the concern you expressed for
abuses that go on in the Grand Jury room since the Court of
Appeals said to the U.S. Attorney, "Take your choice, but
just make one choice or the other and apply it uniformly."
MR. SEIDMAN:

I would disagree with that statement

for the following reasons, Your Honor.

I think what the

Court was seeking to do was to insure to the citizen who is
called before the Grand Jury, since I submit to the Court that
fundamentally that is a coercive and custodial situation,
although this Court has previously ruled under Kandujano and
its progenitors that there i , no constitutional safeguards
similar to Miranda that apply, that there are and there is a
situation here to be dealt with and what the Court was con­
cerned about is that given the large activity in this circuit
sy the Strike Force attorneys and the need that the

33

application of the law or the applicatiori of the Grand Jury
to a witness might vary depending upon the personality

of the

prosecutor, that there should be an adherence by the Strike
Force attorney to the universal concept of giving target
warnings in the Second Circuit and the Court cited back to a
decision written by Judge Medina in U„ S. v, Scully some 23
years ago.
QUESTION:

But the Court of Appeals8 opinion was

not based on the requirement that target warnings be given
but on the basis that whether they be given or not, the
practice ought to be uniform.
MR. SEXOMAN:

There might have been another

vehicle which would have caused the Court to come down with
a similar-type decision in a different set of facts, if that
is what the Court is asking ms, where there is a dichotomy
within the same circuit as to what prosecutors are doing.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that uniformity was not

the fulcrum of Judge Gurfein's decision here?

The Second

Circuit decision?
MR. SIEDMAN:
hera.

Uniformity was not the sole issue

I believe that in addition —
QUESTION:

You do not agree —

MR. SEIDMAN:

--in addition, I believe the lan­

guage of the decision seems to concern itself with the aspect
of fairness.

34
QUESTION:

Well, let me read just one paragraph,

then.
MR. SEIDMAN:
QUESTION:

Sure.

"In the interest of uniformity in

criminal prosecutions within the circuit, which is funda­
mental to the administration of criminal justice, we affirm
the dismissal on count two pursuant to our supervisory
function. "

Mow, is that not the basis on which the Second

Circuit decided the case?
MR. SEIDMAN;

That is the basis under which the

Second Circuit decided the case excepting there is other
language in the case that would indicate that it was not
uniformity limited to the issue of target warnings.
It was seeking to make sure that all witnesses who
/

appear before a Grand Jury receive equal treatment and that
the public be aware of that, Your Honor*
t

QUESTION;

Let me test this out on you, then.

Do

you agree with Mr. Frey's response to a quest lor:, from the
bench that the Attorney General of the United States could
tomorrow instruct all U.S. Attorneys in the Second Circuit
to go back to the general usual practice of giving no target
warnings?
MR. SEIDMAN;

If reading the Gurfein opinion in

the second decision, I would say yes.
QUESTION:

That he can.

35
MR. SEIOMAN:
United States

That the Attorney General or the

Attorneys in the Second Circuit could unifor­

mly change the warnings that would be given to targets that
they presently adhere to.

Whether that could be. attacked for

other reasons, I don’t believe is a matter before this Court
at the moment.
QUESTION:

And that the conviction would be valid?

MR. SEIDMAM:
QUESTION:

Well, as I —

Because — do not answer that because

if you do, I am going to say, will you then release this
woman?

Or retry her?
MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, Your Honor, if I understand

Mandujano and its progeny —
QUESTION:

I do not understand that the Court of

Appeals of the Second Circuit said that this rule could be
changed tomorrow morning.
MR. SEIDMAN:

Provided you accept the concept that

Mandujano avoided the requirement of constitutional giving
of. this type or warning and there is no statute that requires
it.

If there is no constitutional requirement, there is no

statutory requirement, Your Honor, then the only source of
the target warning in the Second Circuit is a matter of prac­
tice adopted within that
QUESTION:

circuit.

Then 1 have a grave problem.

Then this

just involves one person and no presidential value at all?

36
MR. SEIDMAN:

I would say that this case involves

one person, Your Honor and I believe the Court of Appeals
had a problem with that and also seemed to indicate -- seemed
to, in response to Mr, Justice Stevens' concurring opinion
the first time this matter was here it clearly stated that
this is not a general exclusionary rule and to talk about
this decision in general exclusionary rule terms does not
clearly identify what it said in the

circuit opinion.

I think what is being argued here is whether or
not, A, does the Court have this type of supervisory power
and B, assuming the statutory' and rule arguments aside,
whether or not the sanction which was imposed here was an
appropriate one, 1 would submit to the Court that this Court
should not interfere xvith the supervisory power of the Cir­
cuit Court, which deals in the everyday problems within the
circuit and I am sure that when it considered this case
involving Strike Force Attorneys who come into the circuit
and identifies a prior case where it concerned itself in
depth with the relationship of Strike Force Attorneys to the
Jnifced States Attorney — and that was in the Persico case
that the Court of Appeals must have had good reason to feel
that in this particular case, Mr. Justice Marshall, it would
apply the sanction of suppression using the lack of uniform
application of warnings under the exercise of its supervisory
power.

37
And it may well be that this is not a rule — and
I submit that it is not — that establishes from this time on
any misstatement by a prosecutor or failure to state something
that is customary or habitual, assuming it does not raise to
constitutional or statutory level, will be stepped upon by
the exercise of supervisory power.
I think the Court went to great length in an
attempt to assuage this Court by its language that it was
limiting this opinion to this particular case and getting
back to the didactic, it may have felt that this; case warran­
ted this action, given the urban environment of this circuit.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that if precisely

the same thing happened next week that the Second Circuit
would not exclude the evidence?
MR. SEIDMAN:
cuit., Mr. Justice.

Why?

I cannot speak for the Second Cir­
I do not know.

I know what the Second Circuit said in this case
and what it said was that it was not establishing an inexor­
able rule to be applied in each and every case, laor was it
suggesting that every time a prosecutor made a mistake con­
cerning accepted practice that it would utilize its super­
visory power and impose a sanction of suppression which
uxcimately results in the dismissal of a count in an indict­
ment .
QUESTION:

Well, suppose that it had mads such a

38

rule and just announced that you either do it this way or the
evidence will be excluded and said* this rule is made under
our supervisory power.
And you say that situation is not here.

Of course,

somebody might disagree with you and think that it is.

What

would you say about that?
MR. SBIDMAN 3

1 would compliment the Court and

suggest that —
QUESTION:

You do not think that it would be for­

bidden by the Federal Rules of Evidence?
MR. SE I DM AII:

I believe that the argument posed

concerning 3501 has no application to this case, that the
argument proposed by the Government with respect to Rule 402
has no application to this case; 3501 has no application
because this is a denial of guilt.
Therefore, through whatever attenuated concept,
I do not believe that that constitutes a confession.
The
opinion.

Court did not deal with voluntariness in this

Further, as to Rule 402, there is no doubt, as the

Court acknowledged, that all relevant testimony, evidence,

me inherenc power of this Court and the othex* federal court
x would assume that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not

QUESTION:

You say the Constitution of the United

States from which flow the inherent powers of this Court.

Do

you think that before Congress provided for appeals in crimi­
nal cases from the district courts

in 1889 or whenever it

was that —
MR. SEIDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, no, I mean 1889.

MR. SEIDMAN:
QUESTION:

1789.

Oh, right.

That's right.

For a hundred years there was no right

of appeal from a criminal sentence in the District Courts to
this Court.

Do you think there was some sort of an inherent

authority in this Court to review on appeal those kind of
criminal judgments?
MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, I do know that the Constitu­

tion states that Congress establishes the jurisdiction of
the federal courts and I am aware of that statute.
However, knowing the creativeness of the mind, I
would assume that possibly, in answer to your question, that
some learned legal scholars might have developed a theory
under our Constitution that might have permitted, that type
of approach by Appellate Courts to criminal lax»? matters.

MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, our concept of justice did not

change a great deal until 1954, Your Honor, so that may well
be true until then.
However, X am responding to your question most
respectfully and seriously when I state that and I am aware
of the fact that the jurisdiction of the district courts is
created by Acts of Congress.
\

QUESTION:
please?

Mr. Seidman, could I ask you a question,

Do you think

assume

we are persuaded by

Mr. Frey that interest in uniformity within the circuit is
n ot a sufficient justification for exercising the Court of
Appeals supervisory power, whatever it may be.
Do you think the court — this Court now, in

this

case has presented the question whether its supervisory
power would justify — apart from the Constitution — would
justify a rule such as the American Bar Association Standards
recommend, namely, that target warnings always be given and
that, therefore, we could affirm on the basis that a general
rule applicable to the entire federal system would be appro­
priate to implement that kind of policy?
MR. SEIDMAN:

I believe you could-, Your Honor and

I would applaud it, if "that is important.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think

MR. SEIDMAN:

I believe it became extra imporcant

that this Court through its rule-making and supervisory power

41

deal with the Grand Jury in view of its decisions in Manduano,
Washington and Wong and I do not stand here to suggest that I
condone perjury in this argument.

I do not believe that the

Court of Appeals condones it and the sole issue before this
Court is the exercise of supervisory power in the context of
what takes place before a Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

Mr. Seidinan, if I understand you correc­

tly, we could issue a rule that there must be uniformity among
all of the prosecuting attorneys in what they present to the
Grand Jury.

Is that right?
MR. SEIDMAM:
QUESTION:

I believe that —

Then should we not also say that the

judges should be uniform in their sentences?

I mean, while

we are at it.
MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, I think you are asking too

much of me and -QUESTION:

Well, once you get into that, it follows

MR. SEIDMAN:

But however, I think getting back to

Justice Steven's suggestion which I believe is a. manageable
ane and that is, given the fact that the American Bar Associa­
tion has done an extensive study in the criminal justice area
if I understood Mr. Justice Stevens — he was asking whether
>r not the Supreme Court of the United States should adopt
the recommendations of the Aim as is recited in the Jacobs
opinion and

possibly the Court of Appeals may have been

42
hopeful that the Supreme Court, taking a look at that where
it says, if the prosecutor believes that a witness is a po­
tential defendant, he should not seek to compel his testimony
before the Grand Jury without informing him that he may be
charged and that he should seek independent legal advice con­
cerning his rights.

That is a recommendation by the American

Bar Association.
QUESTION:

Yes, well, you may not be aware of it

but I was the author of that report and that did not mean we
were writing a rule of constitutional dimensions or that we
were undertaking to suggest clothing the courts with some kind
of supervisory power to impose uniformity.
These reports of the American Bar Association are
a statement of what a great number of lawyers and judges
thought would be the right way to do it.
MR. SEIDMAN:

I agree with the Court and I am not

suggesting that I assume that the entire standards as finally
adopted should become necessarily the —
QUESTION:

We are talking here about the power

of the Court of Appeals, not the wisdom of this rule.
MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, getting back to the heart of

this case, Your Honor, I believe that the Court of Appeals
exercised supervisory power not in conflict with Section 3501
or with Rule 402 and the best thinking of the Court as to why
it was doing it, I believe is the quote given in the opinion

43
where the Court quoted from Judge Friendly in U,SC v„ Esfcepa
and it stated,

"A reversal with instructions to dismiss the

indictment may help to translate the assurances of United
States Attorneys into consistent performance by their assis­
tants . "
Again, this is the sole, limited, narrow issue that
is before this Court and it does not particularly have re­
lationship solely with respect to target warnings»

It might

well be that the Court of Appeals, as stated by Mr. Frey may
in some future matter unforeseen seek to exercise its super­
visory power

and I cannot believe that this Court, given the

long line of cases, some of which Your Honor has written •—
Mr. Chief Justice Burger has written opinions on and has
identified and recognised the supervisory powers of the Court
of Appeals to deal with matters within the circuit and if I
may respectfully relate to Mr. Justice Marshall's dissenting
opinion in the first Jacobs case, the cases cited therein,
the Cupp v„ Naughten case, Barker v„ Wingo* , the United States
versus Thomas, Ristiano versus Ross and Murphy versus Florida,
some of which bear opinions from Mr. Chief Justice Burger,
clearly acknowledge the existence and propriety of exercise
of supervisory powers and at times the opinions seek to avoid
the exorcise of federal supervisory power in state criminal
cases bat use affirmative language which clearly states that
had this been a federal court matter, that the United States

44
Supreme Court in these instances would have recommended the
utilization of supervisory power to justify whatever court's
concept of fair and equal application of the lav? to all peo­
ple.
I submit to the Court that the sanction therein,
given the argument of the Court of Appeals which I am limited
to, is that the defendant in this case is not escaping jus­
tice so therefore, I do not know that the sanction part of
this case is that troublesome.
The only issue that I could conceive of as being
important and crucial to this is whether or not this was a
reasonable application of the supervisory power and again, I
wish to reiterate in my closing argument that this is not a
trial proper that is before the Court.
What is before this Court is the conduct and man­
agement of the Grand Jury which is an arm of the judiciary
and not an arm of the Executive Branch of Government and I
believe it was in this context that the Court of Appeals
sought to apply its supervisory power, not of the prosecutor
which is the effect of what has happened here, hut rather as
to what takes place before the Court's Grand Jury before
vhich the prosecutor practices as a part of the Executive
3ranch of Government.
And in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question,
in his concurring opinion in the first case, it is clear to

45

me that this is not an

inexorable rule to be applied in all

instances and this Court need not be fearful that with each
slip of the tongue in any particular criminal law prosecution
that there will be a dismissal for suppression which would
result in non-prosecutorial happenings with respect to people
who should be prosecuted and the Court of Appeals clearly
stated that in deciding this case, it abhorred perjury but
it felt that given the fact that there was another portion
of the case to foe tried that it could take this largesse, so

m ..
<•:

to speak, if the Court wanted it pictured as such and employ
the sanction of suppression and therefore, the dismissal of

MR. FREY:
Mr. Chief Justice.

Just

two short points if I may,

46

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
I think in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' ques­
tions about

whether there is any difference between the

Court of Appeals' supervisory power and this Court's super­
visory power, in the context of deciding a case, I do not
believe there is any difference.
Either the Court of Appeals has it and you have
oversight of that power or, I believe neither of you have it.
Now, you do have the power in the context of.pas sing a rule
of criminal procedure,as the Chief Justice suggested earlier
but that is a totally different procedure and ore to which we
would not take exception.
QUESTION:

You do not contend our supervisory

power is limited to rule-making, as I understand: it.
MR. FREY:

No, not at all.
\

%

QUESTION: You do not take issue with the
theory of the HcNahb rule, for example?

basic

I mean, you might

not approve of the exclusion of the confession but that the
Court had the power to adopt such a rule pursuant to its
supervisory power in deciding a case.
MR. FREY:

It did have it previously, yes.

But

we think that —
QUESTION:

That was basically a rule of evidence,

MR. FREY:

It was a rule of evidence and it was a

was it not?

47
rule that was predicated on an antecedent violation of
another rule established by statute or constitution.

Here

we have no antecedent violation, indeed, no rule to be vio­
lated.
There is not any rule.

We can do what we want and

that brings me to the point, to the extent the Court of
Appeals may have been hopeful that this would encourage us
to adopt the ABA standards, this may very well have had
exactly the opposite effect by the punishment that was admin­
istered in this case because I understand in the Southern
District of New York they now have stopped giving target
warnings in. order -- they no longer have a policy of giving
target warnings so that they cannot be accused of violating
their policy in having suppression administered on that basis.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:46 o'clock p.m., the case
was submitted and the Court was adjourned.]
