MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

burgers

We will hear arguments

next in Frank Lyon Company against the United -States.
Mr. Griswoldi- you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please ‘the Courts
This is a federal income tax case.

It comes here

on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed a judgmant for the
taxpayer in the United States District Court for Arkansas.
The question involved is the effect of a sal©
leaseback transaction involving a bank building between the
Petitioner, Frank Lyon Company, as lessor, and the Worthan
Bank and Trust Company, as lassea.
Before stating the facts, I would like to place -them
in context by briefly indicating the basic approach which w©
take in 'this case.
In planning a substantial business venture of the
sort involved here, taxpayers should be able to predict the
tax consequences with soma degree of certainty.

To tills end,

the tax collector should avoid applying the tax laws to
frustrate bona fid® bargains, unless h© can. point to some
reason for doing so, which is pragmatically based in tax policy.

4
This does not. mean that taxpayers should be allowed
to manipulate tax consequences with arbitrary labels , or with
maneuvers which have no economic substance,

But neither should

the tax laws be a joker in the deck for business plearninge
In a situation where ownership is inevitably
divided ~ and that's trua of most business property

no

transaction can b© safely planned if its tax consequences are
mad© to depand on an abstract comparison of the ownership of
bundles of sticks, which various parties carry0
The policy for which we argue is, in effect, that
there should be a presumption in favor of taxing bona fide
business transactions as they were bargained, structured, and
understood by the parties, particularly where, as here, there
is no realistic tax policy reason for scrambling the bargain
which was mads between Prank Lyon Company
QUESTION?
you tell me.

most; of the four million which was the maximum

that Worthen Bank could invest in bank premises,
QUESTION:

Is it correct that the costs to Worthen

of the facilities that were sold ‘to Lyon was about $7,5 million?

6
MR. GRISWOLD?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I see.

MR. GRISWOLDs

Okay.
Lyon paid essentially the cost.

There was e contract by which Lyon agreed to pay not in
excess of $7,640,000, and that is the exact amount which they
paid.
They were advised by the banking authorities that
Worthen could not legally own the building either directly or
through a wholly-owned subsidiary at a cost in excess of the
amount of its capital stock, which was then $4 million.
And that’s Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act.
In addition to this legal obstacle, there was also
a practical barrier.

Worthen Bank had planned to have a $5

million conventional mortgage, and to issue four million in
debentures.

But Arkansas law forbade Worthen from paying

mors than 6 percent: on debentures, and the bonds simply weren’t
marketable at that rate.
In this situation, Worthen sought both legal and
financial advice.

It consulted a number of potential investors

and lenders, including Goldman, Sachs arid Company, and EastmanDillon Union Securities Company of New York? it also made
preliminary contact with the First National City Bank of
New York for interim financing, and with New York Lifa
Insurance Company for long-term loan on the completed building.
In the course of these discussions, the suggestion

7
was mads that the practical and legal problem could b©
solved lay a sale and leaseback with an independent buyer and
lessor.
After -dies© discussions ware well under way, Frank
Lyon Co. decided to enter the competition.

Lyon, as I have

said, is an independent company, though its chairman, Frank
Lyon, is a director of Worthen Bank.
QUESTION? And what's its principal business, Mr#
GriswoId?
MR. GRISWOLDS
QUESTION:

What?
What is its principal business, your

client, Lyon Company?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Their principal business was the

Central Midwest distributorship for Whirlpool and Zenith.
But they had by this time also begun to branch out into other
things, and among other things at about this time they bought
the controlling interest in another bank in Little Rock, and
they were engaging in other business activities. But their
basic business was the distributorship for Zenith and Whirl­
pool.
QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, was Lyon a corporation?

MR. GRISWOLD:

Frank Lyon Company is an incorpora­

tion, yes.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. GRISWOLD:

Frank Lyon Company underbid 'die other

3

potential buyars by reducing the rent payable by Worthen for
the building by $21,000 a year for each of the first five
years*

And on this basis Frank Lyon Company was accepted by

War them as the investor-owner, and Lyon was approved by the
financing agencies„
After extensive further negotiations, Lyon entered
into a number of agreements, beta with Worthen and 'the
financial institutions.

Thera was first a ground lease by

which Worthen leased the land to Lyon for a term of 76 years
and 7 months.

That was actually a year and seven months for

construction and 75 years after the end of it.
The idea for leasing til© ground had been suggested
by some of the New York financiers as a way of simplifying
the ultimata transacti,on.
Thera was, second, a sales agreement by which Worthen
sold the building to Lyon -- and this is interesting, but I
don't think greatly significant — bit by bit as it was built,
for a price not exceeding $7,640,000.

As each piece of

material was incorporated into the building, it was sold to
Lyon.
Now, this was adopted because Worthen Bank could
not own banding premises in excess of its capital, and if it
built the whole building and then sold it, they would have
violated the lav?, and also because Worthen Bank was not subject,
to the Arkansas sales tax on the. materials which would have

9

amount*3-3 to something like $125,0000
Finally, there was a building lease, by which Lyon
leased -the building to Worthen for a term of 25 years, subject
to two sets of opticuso

Thera were, first, four options to

purchase the building at stated figures, at the end of the
11th, 15th, 20th and 25th years of the lease.

And -the basic

term of the lease, the original term of the leas© was 25 years.
And then there were eight options to renew the lease,
beginning with the 25th year, for consecutive five-year
periods»
If all the options to renew were exercised, Worthen
Bank would occupy the premises far a total of 65 years.

But

that still left a term of ten years at the end where Lyon's
ground lease would continue and it would have full entitlement
to the building, no matter what.
The transactions became effective on May 1st, 1968.
During ‘‘he construction period, Frank Lyon Company borrowed
tiie money to finance tl© cost from First National City Bank of
New York, in the amount of $7 million.

It did this on its

own note, on which it alone was liable.
When tiie building was completed, Frank' Lyon Company
discharged its obligation to First National City Bank and to
Worthen by putting in $500,000 of its own money and by
borrowing $7,140,000 from New York Life Insurance Company.
Again, Frank Lyon Company alone signed this note.

10
Worth©a was not a party to it.

Although Worfchen did join in

providing additional security for the note by mortgaging the
parking garage and the land to which it still owned the fee,
and also consenting to ensignmenfc of the leas© to New York
Life.
After Lyon had borrowed the $7,140,000 from New
York Life, it paid off its debt to First National city Bank
and had $500,000 of its own invested in the project»
The government has made much, of the fact that the
rent for the first 25 years under the ground lease was fixed
at. fifty dollars»

There’s soma

confusion in the record

about 'diis» Th© leas® itself says fifty dollars for the term?
at one place in the findings it says fifty dollars per year»
I think fifty dollars for the whole term is correct. I don’t
think it’s of any importance.
However, the amount of this rent is entirely
irrelevant.

Whatever rent was fixed for the land during the

initial 25ryear period would inevitably be taken into account
in determining the rent, for th© building during this period.
If th© rent of the land had bean fixed at $100,000 a year,
then, for simple economic reasons, the rent for the building
would have been increased by $100,000 & year.
It was a transaction that —
QUESTION;

MR. GRISWOLD;

No, you would have to increase the

~ if Lyon had to pay mors ground rent
QUESTION s The effect of it —
MR» GRISWOLD;

— it would have to get more

building rent out in order to cone out —
QUESTION; Well, but the effect of increasing the
ground rent later was to decrease the net rent paid by the
lessee,»
MR. GRISWOLD;

I'm talking about the initial 25-year

period, and simply this apparently anomalous fifty-dollar rent
for the term, I suggest that that is irrelevant.
QUESTION; Could you explain, while you're on that
point, why it was that they made a substantial ground rent’,
after ‘die first 25 years, I think it was, rather th.m simply
reducing the rent on the building?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Because they contemplated the very

real risk that Worthan would not renew the lease, that Lvcn
would b© liable for the .rent specified for the next fifty
years, forty years at high rates; Worthen could walk away
from it; and could collect in the later period $250,000 a year
rent., for which Worthen was liable,
QUESTION; For which Lyon was liable.
MR. GRISWOLD;

After which Lyon was liable»

Yes.

12

Of

course, Hr„ Justice,
After the first 25 years, as Isv« just said, the

ground lease provided for substantial and increasing rents
payabla by Lyon ovs*r the next 40 years, aggregating $7a5 million,,
And for the final ten years of the lease, a reduced ground
rent of $10,000 a year was provided.
The government contends that ifc*s inconceivable that
Northern would walk away from the building at the end of 25
years, or at any subsequent time.

But it's clear that these

escalating ground rents were designed to deal with precisely
this eventuality „
If it were a foregone conclusion that Worthen would
continui to rent the building throughout the entire 65-year
term, ground rentals of up to a quarter ©f a million dollars
a year would not have,been necesiary, just as in the first
25 years, which were binding on She partieso
Lyon also had the absolute right to all the
improvements made by Worthen to the buildingo

At any time

the building lease terminates, Lyon comes into full possession
of the building and all its appurtenances».

And this shows* a

significant benefit of ownership for Lyon, and operatas as well
to negate any inference that the parties never contemplated
Worthan relinquishing control of the building»
How, the ground lease must, of course, be considered
together with the building lease.

The rent payable by the

13

bank daring the first: 25 years of the building Isase exactly
put Lyon in funds to meet its liability to New York Life on
a quarterly basis»
Thereafter, as I have said, the bank had eight
successive options to renew the lease for five-year periods,
and the rent for such periods is fixed at $300,000 per year,
and by that time time Lyon has no longer any obligation to
the financial institutions»
Under -the building leas®, Worthen Bank had four
options to purchase the premises, at the end of 11, 15 and
25 years; these options and the purchase price appear at page
419 of the Appendix»

They are substantial amounts»

If Worthen exercised any one of these options to
purchases, both the building lease and the ground lease would
terminate« '
However, if Worthan did not exercise the option to
buy, the ground lease would continue in full force and Prank
Lyon Company would be liable for the aggregate of $7,600,000
of rent due for the fifty years remaining under the ground

lease»
In this respect, the government has significantly
misstated the situation in a footnote on pace 13 of its
brief»

I'm sure that this was unintentional, but it is

significant»

,

Tee government says there that, and I quote, "The

.14

ground leas a would terminate if Worthen did not renaw the
building lease", close quote»
As I have indicated, this is net true»

The

termination clause is paragraph 9 on page 369 of the Appendix»
Under this, the ground lease would terminate on the exercise
of on© of the options to buy, under Article XX of the building
lease; but there is no provision for termination of the
ground lease on the failure to exercise one of the options to
renew the building leas©»
If the options to renew expire at any time between
the 25th and the 60th year of the lease, Frank Lyon remains
liable for the rent stated on the ground lease, including
the rental stipulated for the fiaal ten years of the lease»
And during all of this period of potentially fifty years,
if an option to renew is not exercised, Frank Lyon Company
is the unqualified owner of the building, able to deal with
it in any way it thinks desirable, lease it to a new tenant,
replace it, sell it, or occupy it himself»
This is not a lease which provides for a bargain
purchase»,»

Th& prices payable if Worth on exercises the

options to buy are substantial.
The trial court has expressly found, on evidence,
that, mid I quota from page 30 4 of the Appendix, "There her
never been any understanding or agreement between Worthen end
plaintiff that Worthen will ever exercise any of its options

15
to purciass,”
And the trial court also found —* and this actually
appears at, three places in the findings, but Idle quotation I
give is also on page 304 — the trial court found that "it is
most unlikely and improbable that Worth on will exercise its
hoptions to purchase at the end of the first eleven years of
fch© lease or at the end of any of the subsequent option
periods„"
QUESTION; Did he give reasons for that conclusion?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr. Justice.

One of them, of

course, is the same capital bind that Worthen Bank is in.
Worthen Bank cannot exercise the option to purchase without
becoming the owner of a bank building which is in excess of
th© ~ of its capital, which violates th© law.
QUESTION: Any finding about the possibility of
increasing its capital?
MR. GRISWOLD;
As I recall.

No, there's no finding about that.

Of course, there's always the possibility, but

in these days of branch banking, 'this applies to all th©
banking premises, and the need of a bank not to put its
capital in the banking premises was certainly one of th© factors
which led tie court to come to that finding.
QUESTION;

Worthen must have been

small bank, with a capitalization of only $4 million.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Its capital has increased since 1968.

16

I don't knew what it is.

It has not increased to a Chase

Manhattan Bank figure»
QUESTION;

Or even close to it® And this building,

this $9 million building, that was certainly more than just
the offices of a small baric, -wasn't it?
MR* GRISWOLD;

Its capital has always been small,

and the record contains a number of references from the
banking authorities, saying Worthen Bank has a capital
problem, it must increase its capital; and they were aware of
this, and they were working at. it.
QUESTION;
Griswold?
it?

What kind of a building was this, Mr.

It was more than just the offices of a bank, wasn't

Of a small bank.

Was it -« did it have ~~ was it an

office building generally, or what?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Well, Worthen occupied a third of

the building —
QUESTION;

A third.

MR. GRISWOLD;

— at ‘Si© time it was completed.

And they leased it to other tenants.

But they did incorporate

into the building and the adjoining premises quite a substan­
tial amount of specialized bank equipment, such as vaults
and teller cages and things of that sort.

But at the time

they started, they occupied a third of the building.
QUESTION;

I share Mr. Justice Stewart*e inquiry.

I’ve always been under the impression the Worthen Bank is on©

17
of the major banks in Little Rock»

And this $4 million figura

does seam to me to be almost under™capitalization? per se»
They8 v© got a good location —
HR» GRISWOLDs

I’m not an authority on the banking

facilities of Little Rock»

My knowledge extends to the fact

that in 196 8 their capital was $4 million and that it has
increased somewhat since that time»
QUESTION2

Mr» Griswold? may I return to the options?

The trial court found that there was little likelihood of
an exercise of the option to purchase at the end of 25 years.
The option price of $201 million? I think it was.

Is not

one reason why the bank was unlikely to exercise the option
to purchase was that the present value of the extended lease
term was» a lesser value? something like $1, 8 million? and
therefore there would be no reason to take the purchase? they
probably could have bargained for the purchase of the building
for less toan the $2.1 million.
MR» GRISWOLD;

No? Mr. Justice? that is the line

which toe government is now pursuing.

After contesting to®

point vigorously below? to.© government now concedas that it
is unlikely that Worth an will exercise a purchase option.
But to© government maintains toat the reason Worthen
will not buy the building is because the rental options are
so attracti'V©? which is essentially your point,
QUESTION;

Wall? they are somewhat more favorable?

18
the dif f©remea between $ 2 „1 million and $.1,8 mil lion , as I
read it*

Is that

do I correctly understand the basic

economics?
MRo GRISWOLDS
QUESTIONs

The --?

That the value of the — if they renewed

on the lease basis rather than the purchase, it would be like
buying it for $1»8 million.
MR» GRISWOLDs

This is a — tills, of course, is a

question of assuming up to 25 to 65 years in advance what
interest ratas will be involved»

But I think the real

difference is a flaw in Idle way of reasoning that.

It is

said that it will only cost Worthen Bank $50,000 to occupy
this building in the later years, because the rental is
$300,000 in tiie later years; but the ground is $250,000»
But -shat ignores the fact that Worthen can walk
away and still gat the $250,000»

Frank Lyon is liable for

the rant on the ground lease, whether Worthen renews the lease
at all or not»
Bo the real question is whether it is advantageous
for Worthen to occupy the premises and,

in contrast to moving

away some place else, opening a new building and collecting
$250,000 a year from Frank Lyon the old one.
QUESTION:

I just want to be sure I understand your

side of the case on this, Mr, Griswold.
Do you disputes the figure -•» I don't know whether

19
it's a finding or just: in the brief — that $1,3 million is
a fair estimation of the valus of the —
MR, GRISWOLDS
we dispute that.

No, Mr. Justice, I don?t know that

We regard it as not necessarily controlling.

There are various reasons why Worthen might not wish tjo keep
its bank there.

The banking community might move away to

other parts of the city, as it has in various places, and, as
was suggested by the president of Worthen Bank in the
evidence in tills case, with the development of electronic
fund trains far, th© whole nature of banking may change.

You

may have simply outlets in department stores and things, and
your bank maV be out in a suburb.
Between the two, it is clear that the option to
renew is probably mathematically more advantageous than the
option to boy. But it still does not follow that the option
to renew the lease will b® exorcised. And if the option to
renew is not exercised, then Frank Lyon remains liable on
the ground lease for very substas.iti.al amounts „
Now, -die government says that
conduit.

Frank Lyon is a. mere

It relies on th© fact that the rental payments from

Worthen to Lyon are exactly the same as the -amount due from
Lyon to New York Life on th© long-term note.

That simply

means that they were not concerned with immediate cash flow.
What it means is that they ware- looking for protec­
tion on return to a combination of tax benefits in th© early

20

years, where they could use , as provided by law , double
declining balance depreciation, and also to profitable opera­
tion, potentially, in the years following the 25-year period.
I’ve talked mostly about depreciation»
briefly about the interest deduction,

Let me talk

I don5t sse how there

can be any question about that»
Section 163 of the Code provides that there shall
be allowed as a deduction all interest paid or accrued in
the taxable year on indebtedness»
Here Frank Lyon Company, an independent entity, was
indebted to First National City Bank and to New York Life
on its notes.

It borrowed the money find it paid interest,

Worthen did not borrow the money, Worthan was not- liable on
the notes, and did not guarantee the notes.

It didn't pay

interest»
Under the statute it seems to me clear that Frank
Lyon Company should be entitled to deduct the interest:»
Lyon is not a finance company„
in this transaction*

It was an entrepreneur,

It invested a substantial amount of its

own money and it undertook large liability on its notes and
on the ground lease.

With reason and with the advice of

counsel (- both parties proceeded on the understanding that
Lyon is the owner of the building and is entitled to the
depre ci«ition deduction.
There is no reason in fairness nor in the term’s of

S'
21
the Interne 1 Revenue Coda why Lyon should not have the
deduction» There is no need to take the deduction away from
Lyon in order to protect, the revenue»
Thera is, I venture to say, no real justification
for a. system which says that the depreciation and interest
deduction, in such a case as this, must wait until 'the final
decision of the highest Court,
Hare, if it had been known that Worthen was entitled
to the deduction, as in effect bald by the court below,
despite the fact that Worthen could not legally be the owner
of the building, than the parties could have bargained,
accordingly„

The rent would necessarily have been that much

higher»
It is important in a case like this, a three-party
esse — not. a case like some of the others where tinny are
just dealing with a finance company, and in the Sun Oil case,
with a tax-exempt pension fund — it's important in a case
like tills, a three-party case, where the owner-less or is not
a financing corporation, that, the transaction be given effect
for tax purposes on ‘the basis established by the agreement,
of the parties.
Tills is the conclusion which this Court reached
in the Lazarus case, thare's no valid reason in tax policy
for not applying that conclusion here.
The judgment below should be reversed, and the

22

judgment of the district, court should be af firmede
Thank you.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr, Smith0
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQa,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT,
MR» SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.;
The question in this case is simply whether this
transaction resulted in Frank Lyon having an investment in
this bank building that would support its claimed income tax
deductions for depreciation and mortgage interest.
A3 the arguments have thus far illuminated, this
particular -speci® of transaction, the sale and leaseback, is
no stranger to this Court, to the lower federal courts or to
the tax bar,
For, more than 40 years ago, this Court held in
Lazarus that the statutory tax deductions attributable to the
ownership of property do not follow legal title, but. turn on
c&pi tal inves txnant.
So the question really is:

Who made the requisite

capital investment .in this bank building, to justify
depreciation?

And who —-

QUESTION;

As I understand that, -the implication of

what you just said, Mr, Smith, and I guess it*3 clear in your

23

brief, that, you do concede that somebody is entitled to the
deductions for interest and depreciation?
MR. SMITH;

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

QUESTIONs

And you say it's Worthen?

MR. SMITH;

We say it’s W orthan.

QUESTION; Right.
MR. SMITH;

And who anjoyed the use of the borrowed

funds to justify the deduction for mortgage interest?
We submit that an analysis of the transaction compels
the conclusion that tee Court of Appeals? properly applied the
several principles in this area, so that Worthen Bank had
the investment in the building, because Frank Lyon, when the
transaction is properly analyzed, did nothing more than lend
Worthen Bank $500,000 to earn 6 percent interest.
QUESTION; Do you draw all of what; you’ve said up to
now out of tee Lazarus case;?
MR. SMITH:

We think tee Lazarus, case as-publishes

the basic principles in the area -— the basic principle in
tee area, that the statutory right to deductions for the
ownership of property do not follow title but rather follow
capital investment.
QUESTION* Well, all that said was that it was going
to treat it as a mortgage under the traditional equitable
rule? what appeared to be a deed outright, was going to be
treated as a mortgage

24
MR. SMITHs

That's true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

but I think ~~
QUESTIONS

It's a tv/c-page or two-and-a-half-page

opinion, isn't it?
MR. SMITHs

That's true, and — but I think that the

part of the opinion you've cited is -- was authority for the
Court adopting the Federal Tax Rule.

That is, there is nothing

unusual about the Court's decision, because essentially
equity in your property had had a similar rule.
But since the Lazarus case, end I think this is
really undisputed, the lower federal courts?-, the circuits,
have uniformly applied the Lazarus principle to analyze these
sale-leasebacks

under the — where the inquiry is s

made 'the capital investment?

Who

And that person or that entity

should get -the proper tax deductions.
I think the thing starts from Lazarus, but we now
have several jurisprudence with, you know, intermediate
appellate courts, commissioner's rulings, and what-have-you,
which set forth the basic settled principles in this area.
QUESTION?

Mr. Smith, I'm just curious, you just

said that Worthan was entitled to it. Does the record show or
do you know whether Worthen in fact received the benefit of
these deductions?
MR. SMITHs

Well, my — the record does not show.

Although my information is that the

for this particular1

25

taxabis year,. Worthen was audited — in other words, the
audits proceeded side by side, so that somebody would get it»
And that the Worthen case was settled, I think in favor of
Worthen,
QUESTIONS

It isn't a situation of the statute of

limitations having ran, as is usually the case?
MR. SMITH?
QUESTION?

No,

No,

Mr, Smith, if the primary inquiry is, as

you phrased it, Who made th© capital investment?, would the
government’s position be precisely the same if there were no
options involved in -the case, no options to renew or options
to purchase?
MR, SMITH?

It would be a much harder case for the

government,
QUESTION?

But would the capital considerations all

be precisely the same?
MR, SMITH?

Oh, no, because what — the capital —

well, yes and no, inthe sens© that I think, you know, on©
of the basic — on© of the basic considerations in our conelusion and the Court of Appeals conclusion, that Worthen Bank
made the capital investment, is that under the primary term

of the leaso, that is the 25-year term, when Worthen was paying?
making these payments which, although contractually it
obligated itself to pay directly to New York Life, it would —
it paid via Prank Lyon.

It made the capital investment,

26
because it: obligated itself, it locked itself into the deal®
In other words, New York Life insisted that Northern's obliga­
tion to pay, to make the payments be absolute, without any
deduction for setoff or counterclaim® And Worthen — and
Frank

Lyon, excuse me, signed the lease to New York Life,

and assigned its right to modify or te.nrd.nata the lease„
Worthen in fact, in turn, agreed to that assignment
and agreed that it would not cancel the lease®

So you have

a situation — and I think that fact is significant — that
Worthen, by making these payments and being legally
obligated, the documents themselves make it legally obligated
to make these payments, which pay off the mortgage, that in
effect it has mad® the capital investment.
I think, to answer your question, the option prices
establish a second and basic point, which the courts have
emphasised in this area; end that is, the option prices
demonstrate that there was no way that Frank Lyon Company
could get any more than $500,000 compounded^at 6 percent in
this deal.

Because if Frank — if Worthen exercised the

option at any point down the line, ‘that is, the 11th, the 15th,
th© 20th or the 25th year, these option pricas — and th©
record is undisputed on this point — were calculated precisely
to give Worthen — to give Freak Lyon $500,000 back compounded
at 6 percent interest.
QUESTION%

Mr. Smith, in answering Justice Stevens'

27

question a moment ago, you referred to our conclusion and
then, you corrected yourself to say that the Court of Apeals
conclusion*
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think that —

QUESTION: Well, let m© finish my question, if I may«,
Just how fra© are either you or the Court of Appeals or this
Court to substitute judgments as to what the realities of a
transaction was fox- the judgment of the district court?
MR. SMITH:

W©11, I think, Mr. Justice Relinquish,

that thure are two operative principles in this area
established by this Court which make this question freely
reviewabla on appeal.
Now, let ms just briefly mention them. The Lazarus
case itself stated that in the field of taxation, administrators
of the laws and 'the courts are concerned with substance and
realities, and formal written documents are not rigidly
binding.

That

we take that to mean, and the courts have

taken that to mean that if Frank Lyon calls itself an owner
in these documents, and Northen Bank calls itself a lessee,
that that

those labels, that nomenclature is not controlling,

Indeed, I suppose if A were to enter into a document with R
and call it a lease and say, “I'm going to lease you these
premises: for $100,000 for on© payment in perpetuity", ‘that
that would be rant by the terms of the document, but it would.
clearly be a sale

28

Now, the second point — and -this is a point which
I think needs addressing# because Mr, Griswold mentioned the
parties' expectations — that more than 17 years ago# in the
Duberstein case, the Court said, with some compelling force,
I think, that it scarcely needs adding that the parties'
expectations or hopes as to the tax treatment of their conduct,
in themselves h&v© nothing to do with the matter,,
QUESTIONS But supposing you talcs both of the
principles you've just stated as agreed to, that still doesn't
fully delineate the scopa of what is finally concluded by
the district court's findings and what appellate courts and
the Commissioner in the tax sphere may speculate about as to
probabilities of things happening on appeal»
MR» SMITH2

I tiiink tint's righto

I think that

the district court hud a role to play here» But our point,
as we'vt! more fully elaborated in the brief, in our brief,
is that the district court's finding did net

whether they
\

are accurata or not, didn’t analyze the transaction fully»
Let me elaborate on that, if I may, because it's a
matter of some concern between the parties»
QUESTION:

In that, process, will you say specifically

what was clcaarly erroneous in the district court's finding?
MR, SMITH s

Yes»

If I may call -she Court's attention to page 6a of
the Appendix, or actually going to the bottom of 5a, looking

29
at the district court's findings»

I’m sorry, Mr» Chief Justice,

this is in the Appendix to the Petition»
QUESTIONS
MR» SMITHs

0he

Thank you,

This is finding No» 6, at the bottom of

5a actually»
Ths district court said the annual rent for the
first eleven years was so much and so much, and the annual
rent for ths next 14 years was so much»
It then went on to s&y/’th© rent on the building
during the option periods totalling 40 years"— turning over
to 6a —•"is $300,000 per year,

Ths evidence reflected,

and the court finds,that the rent to h© paid by Northern during
the term of the. lease is reasonable,

h fact not contested,

by the defendant»"
Wall, let me say two tilings about, that»

The fact

that the rents were reasonable during the primary term is the
beginning of the inquiry and not the end of the inquiry»
Because the district court’s finding that the building rent

of $300,000 a year for the next 40 years is reasonable, while
not erroneous, misapprehended the fact that was brought out
in the earlier part of the argument, the affect of the ground

30

lease setoff.

Because# as you can see on page 7a# the ground

lease rents# after the first 25 years# started to mount up
quit® substantiallyo

And those sharp increases in the ground

lease had the effect of sharply decreasing the building leas®
—■* the building rent*
QUESTION;

Mr* Smith# is it correct# as your

adversary points out# or says# that had the option to renew
not been exercised# Lyon would have remained liable for these
ground rents during that extended period?
KRo SMITH;

That is true# and it*s the — the

footnote in our brief was inadvertent. The ground leas© would
only terminate upon condemnation or taking or upon Worthan’s
exercise of the options«
QUESTION;

Then isn't —■ with that in mind, it's

true the district court finding doesn't explain the fact that
the net income will be the difference between the building
lease and tils ground lease# but 'the finding is really a
realistic finding under that —
MR. SMITH;
Justice Stevens.

No# let ms say this in response# Mr»

I think the district comp's finding can

only be fairly read to say that -the reasoned 1© rant was
$300,00 0 for 4 0 years«
QUESTION:

Wo 11# the part of the building on which

the owner has to pay ground rant of a certain amount.
MR. SMITH:

Right.

But that point - that wasn't

31

the real rent» The real rent that. Worth an was going to have
to pay , if it went, into this option period, the renewal
period, was going to be, first, $200,GOO a year, and then
ultimately, for 25 years, was only going to be $50,000 a year,
and Worthen's own president characterized that as a very,
very cheap price.
Now, let me make another point.
QUESTION;

Well, but is that fair?

Supposing

they had rented a comparable building on soma third party's
land, and paid $300,000 for it, and that was a fair price,
they'd still get income from the ground rent, ground lease
to Lyon, to net it out anyway.
Don't you still look at the fair rental value of
that which they1 re ranting?
Because they always are going to get the ground rant.
MR. SMITH: Worthen is always going to get the
ground rent, if —
QUESTION:

Yea.

Whether -they rent this building

©r they rent a building on neighboring property.
MR. SMITH:

Well, the point is, in this particular

transaction, isn't the importent point that Worthen, who is
going te>, in effect, pay a sharply — I mean that Frank Lyon
I'm sorry ~~ Worthen is going to pay a sharply reduced
building rent*

And that building rent, when you figure it

out over the 40-year period, again was going to redound to

32
Frank — that was only going to pay off Frank Lyon to the
tune of $500,000 compounded at 6 percent interest.
QUESTION s

Is even that completely correct?

Is it not correct that if 'there had not been an exercise —*
if none of the — if all the options had been exercised, then
■die matter had run its course, so that at the end of the 65™
year period Lyon owned the building end had th© land there, it
would not have gotten its $500,000 plus 6 percent compounded,
unless :lt got some additional value during the ten-year
tag-on periodi isn’t that correct?
MR. SMITH:

It would have been slightly short of

that point, which I — it. seems to me that that indicates that
it wasn’t -even going to get $500,000,
All ray point was —
QUESTIONs
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:

There’s a risk —
Yes.
•— as to whether they gat the 6 percent.
Well, yes, but the risk goes the other

— I mean, sur point is that the risk goes the other way.
In other words, that Frank Lyon, in this deal, could
only hop© to get $500,000 compounded at 6 percent interest,
but might gat less.
QUESTION: Well, supposing the building turned out
to be very, vary valuable at the end of the 65th year?
MR. SMITH:

At the end. of the 65th year, they might

33

gat mors if they could rent it for more.
QUESTION:

So is it not conceivable that, with the

set of facts, that depending on what happened, 'they could have
gotten either more or less than $500,000 plus 6 percent
compounded?
MR. SMITH:

May I suggest that if the building

turned out to be terribly valuable, that Worthen probably
would have exercised its option to repurchase.
QUESTION:

You mean Lyon would have probably

charged them a handsome rent for the last XI years.
MR. SMITH:

Assuming they wanted to be in the

building.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes.
I think what -- I think the point, the

important point, you know,and our discussion has indicated it,
is that while Frank Lyon had soma upswing during that last
tan years, the basic — it was basically limited to $500,000.
The whole dual was structured to permit it to receive no more
than $500,030 compounded at 6 percent interest.
I think feat that's -- that is demonstrated from
the condemnation and talcing provisions. Because, at any point
during the transaction, if the government condemned it or it
was destroyed, Frank Lyon would

first the mortgage would

have to be paid off because New York Life was not going to
jeopardize .its position, then Frank Lyon would get $500,000

34

compounded at, 6 percent, interest, and then any excess would
go to Worthen .
The point that, we 'think is significant here, and
tile point that the Court, of Appeals emphasized, is that any
appreciation, any upswing, if this thing turned out to be
terribly veil,table, Worth an would benefit from the appreciation.,
To us this is inconsistent vrith the notion of
ownership of property0

If you own real property and it goes

up in value, you’re an owner, you expect to be able to benefit
from that appreciation in the profit.

You don’t, expect to

have it be taken away from someone in a set of documents who
calls itself a lessee»
And if that someone can take it away, even though it
calls itself a lessee, we submit that that indicates to us
— that it indicates that the transaction may simply be a
loan and not —
QUESTIONS

But let’s get it from the other sid©

for & moment, Mr. Smith.

You say if it appreciated in value

it's likely Warthen would have exercised its options and
retained control.
But supposing it want down in value, farther than,
the parties anticipated?

Who assumes the risk of that

happening?
M3» SMITH:

If it went down in value, it drastically

went down in value, then Frank Lyon would not get back his

35
five hundred —
QUESTION ;

Than what: is the purpose of the

depreciation deduction, to protect against increases or
decreases in value?
MR. SMITE;

The purpose ©f the depreciation

deduction, as Justice Brandeis said a long time ago in Ludey ,
is to permit a deduction for the —QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;

For declining value.
—» for getting the cost of an asset

over tins period —- over the period of the investment.
But the point is, what Frank Lyon is — Frank Lyon
has put $500,000 in this building and has set up the trans­
action in a way to insure that it will never have to pay a.
penny of its own money to pay off the mortgage.
locked in to paying off the mortgage.

Worthen is

And on this $500,000

investment, it is seeking depreciation deduction in excess of
$7 million.

To us there's something wrong with that.

If you look at it from the other side of the coin,
it —
QUESTION; But ray point earlier, Mr. Smith, -** I want
to be sure you've answered it to the best you can —• that would
all be true, even if there were no options to purchase or
options to renew on the part of Worthen.
MR. SMITH;

That; is true. That is true.

But, the

options to purchase end the options to renew, in our view,

36
emphasi z© the fact that Frank. Lyon was limited to what it
could get out of this deal* limited to recover its $500,000
compounded at 6 percent»
Much like any note-holder*

In other words, the

way the deal really worked, when you strip it down to its
essentials, is that. Worthen spent the first 25 years paying
off the New York Life mortgage, and then it was going to
spend the next 40 years, if it didn’t exercise, if it didn’t
pay it off immediately, paying off the, what I would call
the Frank Lyon mortgage*
QUESTION;

Mr* Smith, 1st me itsk just one other

informational question*

Does the record tell us what the

depreciable life of the building was?
MR* SMITH;

The record does not tell us what the

depreciable life of the building is, but we have a reference
to the f;act that the Treasury — the appropriate: Treasury
guidelines in this area call for a 45-year useful life for
such an office building*
And that, If I may, let me pursue 'that for a moment,
Mr* Justice Stevens, because I think it’s significant»
What you have ~~ takJng it from the other aids of the trans­
action, if you look. -;r, it from Worthen*s point of 'view,
Worthen has, in effect, paid off a mortgage over 25 years,
said called it rent*

It, in effect, will be getting, writing

off the cost of this building over 25 years, if this trans-

37

action has to be honored by the tax collector# when, the
useful life, the Treasury useful life of this building is
45 years.
£.nd that leads me to a point I wanted to make about
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, before you go on to your

next point, you assume, of course, that the bank will pay
off its rental obligations, it*s a likely assumption, I would
concede? but a number of banks do fail, including some
fairly large ones.
In that event, who would be responsible for paying
the New York Life?
MR. SMITH:

If the bank failed, Mr. Justice Powell,

Frank Lyon would be looking down this note.

We don’t have

any quarrel with that. We think that,, since it's been
mentioned that the Worthen Bank is a substantial bank in
Arkansas, I would think that that is despit® the confusion
over its capital, I would submit that that is -QUESTION:

You could name a substantial bank in

New York City that had a certain amount of trouble, couldn’t
you?
MR. SMITH:

Oh, yes.

But that's New York City.

[Laughter. ]
MR. SMITH: Anything can happen there.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, since I've interrupted you,

let me corae back to a fundamental.

What policy of the United

38
States and of the Internal Revenue Service is served by this
litigation?

I understand you concede that someone is

entitled, I think you say the bank, to the depreciation arid
the interest deductionse
Row, granted, in a particular case that may — it
may fall ir. the government's favor or it may fall against
tire government, depending on the tax posture or the taxpayer
at the momenti but what policy is served?
MRS SMITH:

The policy, Mr0 Justice Powell, we

submit, is that when Congress enacts these deductions and
permits people to claim them, it assumes — and necessarily
a rational system has to assume this — that idle proper person
is going to claim these deductions.
Now, in til© —
QUESTION: Well, that starts with a conclusion of
proper person,,
MR. SMITH:

Well, no —- in other words, that •—»

and only — well, in other words, if — I don't think it's a
conclusion: in other words, if someone goes to the doctor
and spends money for a doctor yon would assume that that
person would be eligible for the medical deduction.
Now, here we have a two-party transaction, Worthen
Bank and Frank Lyon. The depreciation deduction, as I've
mentioned, is keyed to capital investment.
who made the capital investment?

In other words,

39

Her© is a situation, where Worthen Bank has locked
itself into a deal and committed itself to pay $7 million for
a building over 25 years„

It managed to call it rent in the

documents, but in fact, it’s buying a building»
We submit that it is the proper party to claim the
depreciation deductions»

And the fact that it has bargained

them away, so to speak, to someone else
QUESTION;

But. under the law of the State, it

could not buy a building of that magnitudey a cost of
that magnitude»
MR» SMITH;
Justice.

Let me address that point, Mr» Chief

Under the banking regulations, petitioner has

claimed that it could not own this building» But, as we read
the statute, and it's set forth in our brief, the banking
regulations simply require that it seek permission from the
banking authorities, from the federal banking authorities,
before it made an investment in its building in excess of its
capital»

It sought that permission and the; banking

authorities gave its blessing to this arrangement.
And, in fact., one of the letters called it a method
of financing.

I mean, this is a very standard method of

financing a building. But it must be looked at as simply thats
a method of

financing.

The courts have» so looked at it,

the authorities have — the articles have looked at it.
And, in that sens®, Mr. Justice Powell, wen think the

40
policy has -- the policy has to ba that tha proper person
claim th© deduction,
Now, in th® ordinary case# •»- the record is silent
on this point — w© don't know what th© tax situation# the
tax positions of Frank Lyon Company and the Worthen Bank are#
for any of these years in issue.

But I can say that my

examination of the litigated cases, and this Sun Oil case,
which we've cited, which we set forth in a supplemental
memorandum which the Third Circuit has just decided,
specifically approved the kind of analysis that th© court
below, th© Court of Appeals engaged in.
the

That essentially

-hat th© tax policy has to be that the right, parson

claim the deduction.
And, as 1 . was saying, to pick up the point, that
normally in these situations the tax positions of the parti.es
are entirely diverse, and what you have is a situation where
a corporation in a lower effective bracket wants to finance a
building and trades off its tax deductions to a wealthy
individual,

Down th© road, this is a long deal, a bank

like Worthen company

after all, banks are subject to

special tax treatment and have special ways to write off bad
debts, the Worthen Bank may have losses at some point, it
may have anticipated that it had losses s and this was th©
kind of deal that it. could arrange with someone like Frank
Lyon Company, which was a burgeoning and profitable business,

41
to shelter Its income.
E©cause what: happens at the end of this whole deal
is Frank Lyon Company had $3 million of deductions over the
first eleven years of this deal.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Smith, you * ve answered my question

at some length shout policy, I’m not sure I understand your
answer, but let ms move to another policy question.
The Federal Reserve Board approved this transaction.
If it hadn't, ‘die bank would have been in violation of the
Federal Reserve Act.
It is conceded that the transaction that was mad©
was a bona fide transaction.

Her© another agency of th©

government comas along and says, in effect, No. 1, the
transaction was really illegal because your position is that
the bank still owns 'the building.

If it owns the building#

it’s in violation of the Federal Reserves Act.
Now, what do private parties do in these circumstances?
When one arm of the government tells them»

Go ahead with the

transaction, wcs'v® examined it and we approve it.

And,the

Internal Revenue Service comas along, several years later,
and takes a differant view.
MR. SMITHs
what, happened.

I don’t think, if I may, that that is

Th© banking authorities simply permitted

Worthen Bank to finane® this building in this particular sort
of way.

In giving its approval to this transaction, th©

42
banking authorities in no sense sought to speak to what the
tax consequences of the deal would be,
QUESTIONS

I understand that» That was not my

suggestion.
MR, SMITH:

And I don’t think that th©r© is —

with is making sure that; Worthen Bank did not carry this
building on its books , and they were able to satisfy th©
banking authorities that it would not ba doing that? indeed,
it’s not the nominal title holder.

Would it ba prudent banking to have a

the —
QUESTION; Are you suggesting that the banking
authorities were simply winking at th© idea?
MR. SMITH;

I thin); that the banking authorities

were addressing themselves to an entirely different point.
I think that they were concerned with making sure that the
bank was not overextending itself in some way to the detriment
of its depositors.

And I think that, th© — that th© — that

the bank convinced them this would noth© a problem.
But, in fact, the bank, if you look at the undisputed
legal import of the deal as th© parties mad© it, the bank

44
obligated itself to pay rent absolutely# without any setoff
or deduction for the first 25 years of the term, And that

So why don't you just admit that?
I think that -the government —• I think

that, the banking authorities were interested in who is carrying

this bank on its books,

I think the tax authorities are

concerned with who is obligated to pay off this thing,, and
be obligated to have — to that extent, I suppose that's
right.
But I don't think that's a confusion that necessarily
operafcss to the detriment of private parties,

I seems to me

-that the principles in this area, have been settled for a long
time.
QUESTIONS
QUESTIONS

Hr, Smith, let me ask —
Just a minute, When this Lyon Company

signs a pex'sonal note for the full cost of that building,
that they didn't have a right to think that they were buying
it?
MR, SMITHs

When Lyon Company signed a personal note

for this building, theymanaged to hook on the Worthan Bank
slid lock it into the deal and say, "You've got to pay me
every month'* —
QUESTIONS Then what good was the note?
MR, SMITHs
QUESTION:

Thenotss was simply -- that was simply —
The note which, if it fell through, Lyon

would have to pay it,
MR, SMITHs
Lyon would have

Absolutely,

If the bank defaulted,

to pay it,

QUESTIONS

But they didn't own it?

MR, SMITH: But they didn’t own it, because they

46

locked in Worfchen Bank ho pay offQ

It's simply that Lyon is

really in the posture of a guarantor, because Worthen Bank
has to make these payments.

It's a substantial — it’s a

substantial entity, and if for some reason it failed, then
the guarantor has to talc® over,

But guarantors aren't

entitled tc deductions until the operative facts upon which
the guarantee is premised arises.
I mean, that's our point.

If essentially th® --

if Frank Lyon Company ~~ if Frank Lyon Company ultimately
found itself holding the bag on this thing, than and then
only would it be entitled to depreciation deductions, because
it would then have, it would be forced -bo have an investment
in this building.
Until then, we submit that it was really simply a
passerby who is receiving -these rental payments from Worthen

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, I would like to correct one thing in th®

47

record.

The question as to what Worthen Bank has been doing

with tills depreciation does appear in tie record.

It's at

the bottom of page 201 end the top of page 202, where, about
two indies below the top of page 202 counsel for the
government says?

,5I believe -the bank has continued to treat

•the transaction as it was treated originally” , and though
that is perhaps a little inconclusive, it was tied up by
trial counsel, Mr. Williamson, on page 216 of the record,
where ha asked the president of Worthen Bank, "Has Worthen
Bank contested that determination or agreed to it?"

And

President Penick said, "We have contested it,”
lh© Worthen Bank is not accepting the determination,
Now, with respect to depreciation, x think that
Mr. Smith has been a little glib in talking about 45 years,
A building has lots of components, including plumbing and
m@5iian.lcal and electrical and ©levators, and the depreci.ati.on
period for them is 15 years.

For architectural and general

construction, it is 33 years. And finally, for the structural
frame, it is 40

years,

■lh© fact is chat a very high proportion of this
total depreciation is available within 25 years, more than,
close to 90 percent, and there isn't much difference over
25 years between double declining balance and straight-line
depreciation.
And then, final y, x would like to say that it's

48
perfectly plain here, Mr» Smith keeps saying in his brief
here that permission was sought: and it was given? wall, it
was given for this sale-leaseback arrangement»

Permission

was sought to build the building and own it, and it was
refused,
£nd this isn't, a purely cosmetic matter of a banking
official trying to keep this from appearing on the balance
sheet.

If Lyon's liability is as lessee, and that is the

way in which Lyon supported the — that is the way in which
Worth@;a supported Lyon's liability, the saiae way that any
building owner looks to his tenants to pay the rent in order
that ha car pay 'the bank what he has to have.
If Worthen went insolvent, I'm not instantly
familiar with the immediata details of the bankruptcy law,
but my recollection is that there would be a claim on behalf
of the depositors for two years' rent., but not for all the
future *
On the other hand, if Worthan Bank vras liable on
the nobs, there would be a claim in its bankruptcy for the
entire amount of the note, and that is a vary real difference,
and the reason why the banking officials, rightly, would not
allow Worthen to own the bank*
Thank you,
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, gentlemen.
