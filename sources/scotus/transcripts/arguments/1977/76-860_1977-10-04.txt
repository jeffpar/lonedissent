PRO FEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear first this

morning No. 76-860, Califano against Jobst.
Mr. Urbancsyk, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L. URBANCZYK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. URBANCZYK:

Mr. Chief Justice, find may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal by the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare from a judgment of the United
States District Court in the Western District of Missouri.

The

case generally involves entitlement provisions of Section 202(d)
of the Social Security Act.

Under Section 202(d), as the Court

may recall from its consideration of the same statute two
terms ago in Mathews v. Lucas, insurance benefits are provided
to the children of a wage earner who himself i.s receiving old
age or disability insurance benefits or who has died fully or
currently insured under the act.
This is the second time this case has corae to this
Court.

As I will explain in a minute, the insurance provisions

that are at issue in this case caused a termination in
appellee's child’s insurance benefits in 1970 when ha married.
Appellee instituted this law suit to challenge the discontin­
uance of his benefits on the grounds that the provisions
created classifications that violated the

Due Process Clause of

4
the Fifth Amendment.

Originally the District Court agreed

with appellee and declared the statute's classifications
unconstitutional as applied.
At the time of that initial judgment in early 1974
the record did not reflect that although appellee's benefits
were terminated—social insurance benefits were terminated—he
and his wife nevertheless were receiving benefits under another
title of the Social Security program, Title XVI, the new
supplemental security income program, and that those benefits
were only-- marginally less than the amount of benefits he and his
wife would have received had his child insurance benefits not
been discontinued.
Because, of the deficiency in the record when the
Secretary first appealed to this Court, the Court vacated and
remanded for reconsideration of the case in light of theses
now circumstances.

On remand the record was supplemented by

stipulation, but the District Court reinstated its original
judgment, holding that the supplemental security income program,
was irrelevant to appellee's claim.
The Secretary appealed a second time, and that is the
present posture of this case as the Court considers1, it.
Let me describe briefly the provisions of Section
202(d'

that are at issue in this case and their effect on

appellee.

Among other entitlement provisions of Section 202(d)

the applicant: for child’s insurance benefits—that is, the son or

5

daughter of a wage earner--must be unmarried.

Appellee was

unmarried in .1957 when he originally applied for benefits upon
the death of his father.

The other eligibility requirements

of Section 202(d) include the requirement that the child be,
at the time of his application, dependent upon the wag©
earner.
Lucas.

That was the requirement that the Court considered in
And also that at the time of the application the child

be either under 18 or a full-time student under age 22 or that
the child be disabled, the disability having begun before the
child became ag© 22.
Regarding the benefits of the disabled child, so long
as the disability began before age 22, benefits vrere continued
without regard to age.

Appellee, Jobst, for example, is a

person who has been disabled sine© birth.

And he was therefore

eligible to receive insurance benefits even though he was 25
whan his father died.

In contrast, the benefits to non-disabled

children ax® terminated when the child attains the age of 18 or
22, depending on whether or not he is a student.
Q

Counselor, do you know whether there are many

marriages each year between insured disabled parsons and
uninsured disabled persons?
MR. URBANCZYK:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, the record doss

not show the numbers that are involved in this case, and I am
not. aware of the numbers.

1 suspect—and this is confirmed by

the Social Security Administration—that the numbers are very,

6

very low.

But I do not have exact figures.
The statute does provide that there are certain events

that terminate child's insurance benefits.

Whan the non­

disabled child reaches a certain is age one we just mentioned.
Death is another.
marriage.

The event we ars concerned with here is

The statute provides, with one narrow exception, that

all child

insurance beneficiaries, whether they are disabled

or non-disabled, student or non-student, loss their entitlement
to benefits when they marry.
Q

That is what happened here,

If that stopped there, would it be constitutional?

MR. URBANCZYK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackinun.

As I will

go on to argue, the general termination rule Is itself
rational;; and because Congress amended the statute in 1958 to
provide a limited exception for certain disabled children does
not change that analysis.
into the inquiry.

It simply introduces a new element

And, as we have explained in our brief, the

classification created by that narrow exception is rational.
There was a reason for Congress to treat that special class of
beneficiary undor Title- II of the act and not appellee's
situation.
When child's insurance benefits were, first provided,
there was no narrow exception to the general termination rule.
In 1958 Congress amended the statute to provide that benefits
would not; be discontinued when a disabled child's insurance
beneficiary married an individual who also 'was entitled to

7
insurance benefits under the act.

In those cases the amendment

provided that marriage would not terminate benefits.

I will

explain Congress's reason for enacting that narrow exception
later.

But it is relevant here to know only that the rationale

or the amendment does not cover appellee.

Apnellee is a

disabled child's insurance beneficiary or was a disabled child's
insurance beneficiary.

But his wife was not an insurance

beneficiary under the act.

His benefits, therefore, like the

marriage of most other child’s insurance beneficiaries, were
terminated because of his marriage.
Central, to the District Court's reasoning in this
case—
Q

His wife was and is disabled?

MR. URBANCSYK;

That is correct.

That was central to

the District Court's analysis in this case, that his wife is
disabled.
Q

And the reason that she is not a beneficiary is

simply that her parent was not covered; is that it?
MR, URBANCS5YK:

That is right.

Her parent was not

an insured wag® earner and therefore she was not entitled to
benefits under Title II of the act by virtue of her mother or
father.

That was central to the District Court's analysis in

this case.-—that is, that his wife was disabled and unable to
provido support for him.

The court, suggested that termination

is rational whore the beneficiary marries someone who is able

8

to support him.

But where the beneficiary marries someone who

cannot support him the Court reasoned the need for support
continues and so, as a constitutional matter, must benefits
continue.
Th© record does reflect that Sandra Jobst, appellee's
wife, is disabled and unable to provide support.
point out. that it is because

I hasten to

of that disability and because of

their need for assistance that Sandra and John Jobst now
receive a monthly benefit under the supplemental security
incorns program.
Q

And, as I mentioned""
This is part of the same act, is it?

MR. URBANCZYK:
Social Security Act.

Yes, it is part of Title XVI of the

And the benefit provisions at issue in

tills case are Title II.

It is the same act.

It is a form of

federal relief.
Q

What is the difference in amount?

MR. URBANCZYK:

The difference in amount that the

record reflects in the stipulation set forth in our appendix,
Mr. Justice Brennan, is that at the time that stipulation was
entered into there was approximately a $20 difference.

That is,

Sandra and John Jobst were receiving $20 less than they would
have received.
Q

Per month?

MR. URBANCZYK:
Q

Per month.

Does that condition obtain today?

9

MR. URBANCZYK:

There has been soma change in

circumstances which is not reflected on the record.

I under­

stand from appellee’s brief that Sandra and John Jobst are
separated and nov;? divorced,

And I understand from the Social

Security Administration that that has caused an increase in
both of their individual rates for supplemental security
income.

That is, when they were married, they were receiving

a couple rate which per person was less.

Nov? that they are

separated, the per person supplemental security income is
increased.
Q

Under the general rule of the statute that

terminates benefits upon the marriage of the beneficiary, if
there is a subsequent divorce within the period that the

benafic.1Ui.ry

joule ba eligible-—i„©., under 22 or under 13,

depending upon whether he is a student or a. disabled person—
does the statute provide that the former benefits resume?
MR. URBANCZYK:

No, it does not, Mr. Justice Stewart.

There is a limited r<aantitlement provision, which is Section
202(d)(vi), and I think the only circumstance in which a person
i

who loser entitlement can then be reentitled is if he passes
the age 18 and then becomes a full-time student.

He can then

receive benefits from the time he becomes a full-time student
until ago 22,
Q
and divorce?

But there is no reentitlement after marriage

10
MR. URBANCZYK:

After marriage there is no reanfcitle-

meat after marriage.

Q

Or the death of the spouse?

MR. URBANCZYK:
correct.

That is correct.

Or the death of the spouse; that is
Only a very narrow reentitlement

provision.
)

I will discuss the significance of SSI in a moment.
But for now I would like fee argue that even if SSI ware not
in existences, the statutory insurance provisions that issue in
this case are constitutional.

In holding to the contrary, 'the

District Court reasoned, that or drew significance from the fact
that appellee ramaincjd needy after his marriage.

But in so

reasoning, I think the court fall victim to misunderstanding
both the

atv.v:<a of Title 11 of the act and the requirements of

the Due Process Clause.
Under Title II of the act an individual's actual need
in a welfare sense has no part in the allocation of benefits.
Benefits ire not -paid on the basis of an individual's need.
Rather# Titi® II is a program of social insurance designed to
protect the wage Garner and his family from a loss of income
occasioned by the wage earner's disability# retirement, or
death.

Benefits are paid to members of the wage earner's

family because they are presumed to be dependent on the wage
israin and they

the ones who are most likely ‘bo suffer from

a loss of the wage earner's income.

11
Thus, It is this relationship of dependency with the
wage earner that is the critical factor in determining an
individual's entitlement to what we call secondary insurance
benefits—-that is, benefits payable to the individual member of
feh@ wage earner's family on the basis of the wage earner's
account.

These, propositions are hardly new to this Court»

Indeed, in stating them I have been paraphrasing from many of
the Court's recent decisions, decisions in cases such as
Weinberger y„ Sal.fi, Mathews v „ Lucas, Califano v. Goldfarb,
Mathews v. do Castro.

These cases all stress that Title II

benefits are net paid on the basis of individual need but
instead

ii

re paid on the basis of presumed need, of the family's

presumed need, an individual’s membership in that family, and
his presumed dependency on the wage earner's income.

That is

why in de Castro, where the Court considered claims of the
divorced wife for benefits under the act the Court said that
arguments concerning the divorced wife's economic situation
were, quete, "hardly in point," close quote.

Divorce works a

substantial change in the relationship of dependency between
the wage earner and spouse.

And that was suffici.er.it, in the

Court's view, to sustain a different treatment of divorced
wives.

The same analysis is appropriate here.
Wholly aside from a concept of economic need, upon

marrying a child normally departs the wage, earner's family,
which Tit.la II was designed to protect, and he or she starts

12

a new family.

Like divorce for a wife, a child's marriage

generally changes or redness the relationship of dependency
between a wage earner and his parent.
Q

But it is not normal that the wife takes care

of th© husband, is it?
MR. URBANCZYK:
Q

Pardon me, Mr. Justice Marshall?

It:, is not normal that the wife takes care ©f

the husband, is it—-which would be required in this case,
would it not?
MR, URBANCZYK:

It is normal I think, no matter

whether it is the—
Q

When did it become normal, right now?

MR, URBANCZYK:
Q

Pardon me?

It is normal that a wife takes care of her

husband?
MR, URBANCZYK:

It is normal that when a person

merries, the relationship of dependency between the child and
his parents is reduced or ended altogether.

And I think that

is true without regard to whether or not the wage earner's
child is a woman or a man.
Q

The Court is prepared to emphasize the importance

of not thinking in stereotypes in this area, is it not?
MR. URBANCZYK:
Q
hi3 wife.

That is correct.

Especially—

The stereotypical picture is & husband supporting

13

MR. URBANCZYK:
Q

That is right.

What is the difference between that stereotype

and the stereotype that when you get married, you leave home'?
I guess it is whichever one you want.
MR. URBANCZYK:

I think in allocating benefits under

Title II, Congress has designed an insurance program, not a
welfare program or a general assistance program, and has
allocated benefits on the basis of these broad presumptions,
which this Court time and time again has sustained as consti­
tutional and . as a reasonable way of allocating Insurance
benefits
Q

To balance what the Court has said about

stereotype, the Court has also said many timer, that Congress
is entitled to legislate on the basis of the generality of
human experience, has it not?
MR. URBANCZYK:

That is correct.

I think the term

in Lucas was reasonable empirical judgments about the likelihood
of dependency anc the likelihood of an event's effect upon
dependency.

And that is what Title II is really all about in

so far as. secondary insurance benefits are concerned.

That is,

the likelihood of dependency upon the wage earner versus
membership in the wage earner's family.

And this: Court time

and. time «.gain has said that the Due Process Clause does not
require case by case adjudication of that.

Broad legislative

classifications such as are at issue hare are necessarily only

14
imperfect substitutes for case by case adjudication.

This

Court in cases such as Lucas and d© Castro, however, has held
that these broad legislative classifications are valid so long
as they reasonably reflect, the likelihood of dependency.
that is what the general termination rule here does.

And

It

reflects the common experience view that marriage normally ends
or substantially reduces
support.

a

child’s special need for parental

And that is sufficient to sustain the constitutionality

of the general termination rule.
The District Court and the appellee argue that even
if the general termination rule is rational, the narrow
amendment for certain disabled children creates an unconstitu­
tional distinction.

Remember in 1958 Congress; enacted a

narrow excaption to provida that benefits not be discontinued,
when a disabled child’s insurance beneficiary marries someone
who also is entitled to insurance benefits uncer the act.

And

the; arguirent in essence is that having dec!dec. to extend
benefits to that class of beneficiary, Congress is also
constitutionally required to extend benefits to appellee.
Q

Th-2 argument is that it is constitutionally

under-inclusive; is that it?

It is unconstitutional because

it is under“inclusive?
i

HR, URBANCZYK:

Yes, that is correct because there is

no real distinction between appellee and fch© class of benefici­
aries benefited by the amendment.

And, therefore, it was

15
irrational to extend benefits to one and not the other.
Q

Not to include the--

MR. URBANCZYK:

That is correct.

As we explain in our brief, the narrow exception to
the general termination rule was part of a broad set of
amendments in 1953.

Several ether provisions of the Social

Security Act providing benefits to members of the wage earner’s
family require that that beneficiary be unmarried or unremarried,
the widow or the widower, for example, of the wage earner.

The

1958 amendments added a savings clause to each of these
provisions, providing generally that insurance beneficiary's
benefits are not discontinued when they marry another ansurance
beneficiary under the act.
The principal reason for these amendments is explained
in thr* legislative history.

Congress understood that a marriage

between tvo insurance beneficiaries caused a simultaneous
termination of benefits.

If, for example, an a.gfd widow married

a disabled child's insurance beneficiary who, remember, is
paid benefits without regard to age, both of their benefits
would b© terminated under the act as it stood prior fee 1958«
Congress recognised that this was

e

speciei form of hardship.

And I say special because it was uniquely caused by the
internal workings of the Social Security Act.

So, Congress

detenlined tc remedy the problem or the perceived hardship by
amending the act rather than establishing a new program.

And it

16

was easy to remedy this problem within the existing benefit
structure without

added administrative cost or without altera­

tion of the method of allocating benefits under Title II.
Marriages between insurance beneficiaries was a readily
identifiable situation.

Roth of these persons6 status and

situation was known to the Social Security Administration
because they were already receiving benefits under the act.
Moreover, the problem presented by these marriages
could b® readily resolved by simply amending the statute to
provide that benefits not be discontinued.
In short, these amendments were viewed as an easy
cur© to what was perceived as a flaw in the internal workings
of the system.
Appellee did not marry another child's insurance
beneficiary.

Therefore, to the extent that he remained needy,

his continued need was not occasioned by circumstances that
Congress sought to remedy in 1958.

It is cf course a cardinal

principle of constitutional adjudication that Congress may
constitutionally spend money to solve one nroblem and not
another so long as the spending decision is not arbitrary.
Here there was a good reason for resolving the problem of
marriage between two insurance beneficiaries under Title II of
the act but rot resolving the problem created by appellee's
situation.
As I mentioned, it was easy to identify the marriage

17
of insurance beneficiaries.

But appellee’s need, which arises

from his marriage to someone who is unknown to the Social
Security Administration could not be identified without
substantial alteration in the method of allocating benefits
that is presently employed in Title II.

Title II uses broad

presumptions as to dependency, as we said,, and that method
would not identify appellee.

I suppose it would also not bs a

sufficient indicator of need that appellee’s wife is disabled
since presumably disabled people may have resources or be able
otherwise': in some other way to provide support.
So, whc.t would really be needed is a very close
analysis of marriages of all insurance beneficiaries to
determine who was needy and who was not.

And presumably that

inquiry would call for—-that determination would call for a
close detailed menth-by-month inquiry into eligibility.
Moreover, Title II would have to be further altered
to pay these persons on the basis of these individualized
determinations of need.

And, as I have explained today and as

I have explained at length in our brief, Title II is simply not
set up for that purpose, and the Constitution dees not require
that it he altered to accommodate that purpose.
Instead, without working such a drastic change in
Title II, Congress instead has combined general assistance
programs to work in tandem with the insurance previsions of
the act by providing for the relief of need that is not covered

18
by insurance programs.

Here in particular under the supple­

mental security income program provided for in Title XVT of the
act, benefits are allocated on a basis of an individual's
need.

Appellee's case rests ultimately on the fact that he is

a needy person.

But the supplemental security income program

has taken up where Title II has left off in providing appellee
with a form of federal relief.

I think when seen in this

context there can be little doubt that appellee has been
treated rational].'/ by the Social Security program and that the
Title II provisions at issue in this case are constitutional.
Q

You are satisfied that that is all you need to

indicate is rationality?
MR. URBANCZYK:

Yes, Mr. Justice White.

I think that

so long £ s the purpose is permissible—-and I do not think there
is any issue afccut that here—if the means are rationally
related to those end,, the Court has said that the social welfare
programs or classifications dealing with economic and social
welfare issues can b@ sustained as constitutional.
Q

It does deter marriage, I would suppose.

I mean,

a general marriage rule would deter marriage, would it not?
MR. URBANCZYK;

It deters marriage I suppos® in the

same sense that other laws which affect an individual and
whether or not he gets married—
Q

So, you do not think he needs to pay much

attention to the validity of your general marriage rule or

19
disqualification of marriage?
MR. URBANCZYK:

No,

1 think the focus-—appellee's

and the District Court’s focus—is ©n the distinction
created by the narrow exception.
Q

So, your answer is, "No, you do not need to pay

any attention to that"?
MR. URBANCZYK:

No, I do not need to pay any attention

to that, although I do think that whether they like it or not,
appellee's argument implicates that general termination rule.
I think we necessarily had to address the issue in our brief
and in this case,.
Q

Is it not sometimes true that -iwo individuals

who marry, each having an income, will pay a higher tax than
they did unmarried, separately?
MR. URBANCZYK:

The tax law was something 1 had in

mind whs;,-. 1 was trying to answer Mr. Justice White's question.
Q

I suppose

&.

state law -that permits a minor to

renounce his contract, so long as he is under the age of
minority or lot married, might be said to deter marriage too.
MR. URBANCZYK:
Q

Yes, I think that that is correct.

I was not suggesting that the rule would be

invalid generally,

I just suggested it might raise th© level

of scrutiny so that you have to make individual determinations
of need rather than have either an over-inclusive or an underinclusive, classification„

20

MR. URBANCZYK:

I do not think so, Mr. Justice Whits.

I think da Castro, it could be said, implicated the same kind
of personal decisions, the divorce or continued marriage of an
individual? and certainly the unanimous Court there did not
subject, the classification

to any higher form of scrutiny than

that which I have: identified today.

This is not to say that

the statute will not survive a higher form of scrutiny.

But

I think that we are talking here about the same—
Q

But you might have some troubles?

MR, URBANCZYK:

No, I do not think 1 would have

trouble, but I have not really, frankly, thought about: it.
Q

You certainly have given enough attention in your

brief to the validity of your underlying marriage rule.
MR. URBANCZYK:

That is right, I think, because

really what is at the bottom of the District Court's concern
is the fact that the underlying assumptions of the general
termination rule may not have worked in this case. Appellee may
have married someone who was not able to provide support for
him.

And I think that portion of our brief arc! the portion of

our argurent today points out that that is largely an irrelevant
consideration when we are caught talking about insurance
benefits and Titia II of the act.
Q

' /hat would happen if there is an annulment?

MR. URBhNCZYK:

That is a situation which the Social

Security Act does not address.

I do not know the legal effect

21
of an annulment.
Q

If fch© marriage ware void—

From everything you have said up till now, if

there was an annulment, he would be out of it.
MR. URBANC2YK:

That is correct.

Annulment is a

special circumstance that I had not given explicit consideration.,
Q

But he would be out?

MR. URBANC2YK:

I would think so, unless he had a

good lawyer who can make an argument that annulment voided the
statute ab initio so that in a sense, under the law, he was
never really married.
Q

That is what annulment means.

Q

Mr. Urbanczyk, is the SSI program relevant to

your constitutional argument at all?

I do not understand it

to be, but I just want to be sure.
MR.

UREANCZYK:

Mo.

I certainly think th© insurance

provisions at issue can be sustained as constitutional, should
be sustained . without reference to the SSI program.

I think

th® existence of the SSI program, however, underscores the
purpose c£ Titia II end how the Social Security program interrelates, th© different programs intarrelate.

And I certainly

think that to the extant that appellee's claim is based ©n the
fact that he is n?©dy, SSI's benefits provide relief for that
form of need,
Q

bub there was no constitutional requirement that

the SSI program ba adopted in order to save this particular

22

statute, if I understand you.
MR. URBANCZYK:

No.

I think the remand in the first

instance was largely to supplement the record to bring that
into the case, but our position is that the statute would be
constitutional with or without the SSI program.
We therefore respectfully submit that the judgment of
the District Court be reversed.

Thank you.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Riffel.

Yon may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME D. RIFFEL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, RIFFEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court:
I represent John Jobst.

Mr. Jobst maintains that the

decision of the District Court on remand should be affirmed.

I

think at the beginning there are certain things that we want to
emphasize.

1 lumber one, the holding of the District Court is a

very narrow one.

It is to the effect that 202(d) puts child's

insurance beneficiaries who are disabled into two classes.

One

class totally disabled recipients who marry other totally
disabled recipients and continue to receive Social Security
benefits, anc. a second class which marries totally disabled
non-recipients--in

this case a recipient of welfare benefits*—

and for this reason alone perpetually loses his right to life­
time Social Security benefits.

As was admitted by appellant,

23
this termination is perpetual.

Mr. Jobsfc, therefore, by the

statutes is relegated to a lifetime of receipt of welfare
benefits.

This is the case regardless of whether you call it

supplemental security income or whether it is federally assisted
welfare disability benefits under statutes of the State of
Missouri.

It is still welfare.
Q

It is still need based.

Mr. Riffel, could I interrupt you?

Is it really

quite correct to say the statute makes the classification you
describe?

There is nothing in the statute that places people

who married totally disabled, non-recipients in a special
category.,

There is a broader category of which they are a

part? is that r„ot correct?
MR. RIFFEL:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that the

statute ran be read to do specifically that, as was road by
Judge Oliver in Section 202(d)(5)(B)? it specifically speaks of
disabled child recipients who do marry other disabled child
recipients.

Sc, under that specific provision I think the

holding of the Court could b® very narrowly limited to that
Section B.

I'md perhaps the constitutionality of Section Af

which refers tc general marriages—like someone receiving old
ag® benefits--could be left alone.

That would bo one possibil­

ity.

It is people

Is

that not the. classification?
MR. RIPPEL:

If you look at the broadest spectrum? I

think it is, yes.
Q

That is the line the statute draws.

You are

saying that within that broad category -there is this smaller
category.
MR. RIPPEL:

Yes.

The statutory scheme, as a whole

generally provides anyone who marries another recipient who
is eligible under that statute continues to receive benefit.
All I am saying is that there is a narrower provision, which I
think is what the District Court was looking at in a specific
C&3@.

Q

Your submission is that the District Court's

decision should not be understood to affect the validity of
the gm&i. al provision of the Social Security Act?
MR. RI.FFEL:
Q

Yes, sir.

That would terminate benefits for a beneficiary

of tho csitegory into which your client falls who marries a
wag® earner or anybody els® who is just simply not disabled;
is that right?
MR. RIPPEL:
Q

Yes, sir, that is my precise point.

It does make it rather narrow.

MR. RIPPEL:

Another point we want to emphasis© is that

25
there is a substantial difference in benefits.

At the time of

the remand of this case there was considerable disagreement
between the government’s position and our position as to just
what effect SSI and Social Security benefits had as compared to
one another on the level of benefits.
compare that as to the family,

The government chose to

Mr. Jobst, the dependent of ;an

insured wage earner, however, admittedly was receiving far less
than h© would have had he been a Social Security recipient.
The reason for this is that SSI is based on need.

That is,

for ever}' $2 earned above $80, the benefits as.*® reduced by a
total of $1.
unlimited.

Under Social Security, Mr. Jobstcs assets are
He could become a millionaire by windfall and still

receive benefits.

Under SSI, the most Mr. Jobst can have in

assets i«; $2,250 and remain eligible.
Another important point is that Congress has in
fact discriminated at the level of benefits between Social
Security and supplemental security income from an historical
perspective.

This is clearly shown by the fact that at the

time of rsm&M in the entry of the stipulation which was the
record

ok

rsnand in this case, there was a difference of some

$9,000 S.z the leva! of benefits received by Mr. Jobst as compared
to what he would hav© received had he continued receiving Social
Security benefits.

I £il30 rant to emphasize that even had Mr. Jobst
remained :• -srxled-~which h.@ did not, his marriage has now bean

I

dissolved, he has no further relationship to Sandra Jobst, he
is now living alone—that ©van had he remained married, an
amount of $20, which it was at 'that time, per month for a person
or family with an income so low can be a hug© amount of money
for that family.
Just what did the District Court do?
it was a very strange holding.

I do not think

1 do not think the court

deviated in any way from any current standard established by
this Court.

Rather, I think that Court was looking to the

central question under the Social Security Act, that question
being, Was that person dependent?
the insured wage earner?
Q

Did he remain dependent on

Was that terminating event reasonable?

The District Court's

constitutional decision

was made in January ©f '74, was it not?
MR. RII’PEL:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

That was before our decision in Weinberger,

hofore our decision in Lucas, and before our decision in
d© Castro?
MR, EIFFELs

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, and

you would be a better judge than I of this.

But my under­

standing of your current opinions are that you can still apply
the standards established in Richardson v, Belcher and
Flemming v. Wester—that is, imposing the Equal Protection
standards ©f the 14th Amendment on -the 5th Amendment as to
federal logislation and stating that an utterly irrational

27
dis criminatory classification is barred by the 5 th Amendment.
\

1 do not believe that those more recent cases change that
standard.

And the District Court specifically cited Richardson

3L°

and Flemming v, Nestor.

This was the standard that

was applied and, under my understanding, this is still the
proper standard applied by the Court,
This is also consistent in the view of Mr, Jobst
with the case of Mathews v, Lucas and other more recent cases
which have consistently stated that it must be judged against
the standard of the actual purpose of Congress in enacting
child's insurance benefits.
What was that st.an.dard?

why was it enacted?

It is

quite clear that at the time of the original enactment of that
act in 1956 the. Congress had two objectives in mind.

The first

objective was to assure that dependents of insured wage
earners had a certain amount of security and income in the ©vent
of the death, disability, or retirement of tho insured wage
earner•
Tha second reason, which we submit is equally
important an3 under which there is as much discrimination in
this particular case, is to assure the American worker that in
the event of his retirement, death, or disability, a disabled
child who is unable to provide for himself will be taken care of
under the child's; insurance provision.

That original act

requires that the party establish dependency cm that insured

28
wage earner in order to be eligible.
Q

Is not the language of Congress one of the

bast evidences of the purpose that it had in mind?
MR. RIFFEL:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that you have

to go first to the statute itself and what it actually stated.
Q

And here the statute itself clearly bars your

client, doss it not?
MR. RIFFEL:

The statute itself—we argued at one

point that under what we called I think a libaral reading of
the statute that you could state the Congress never intended
this party to lose his benefits upon marriage.

I think that

that could be read into the act and that anything that
happened in this case in terms of discrimination 1 think may
have bean a non-intentional application of the act, something
they never thought ef.

But, on the other hand, undor a strict

reading of that law, yes, it is clear that as it was originally
enacted and as it exists, it doss terminate benefits.
But, on the other hand, the legislative history of
this law is guitcf clear.

We are not talking about a statutory

scheme which has been in effect for a certain period of time.
Social Security benefits have existed since the 1930s.
Q

Are you arguing that the legislative history is

contrary to rhe statutory language that bars your client?
MR, RIFFELs
Q

Yes, sir, I think it is.

Which do you take, ill© express legislative

29

language or legislative history in a case like that?
MR. RIFFEL:

I think any time you have a situation,

Your Honor, where a statute excludes a certain class that you
have to look at the legislative history and the central
purpose of that legislation,
statute says.

It is not a question of what the

It: is a question of whether that statute is

constitutional and whether it is proscribed by the 5th
Amendment,
Q

The question is whether what the statute says is

constitutional.
MR, RIFFEL: .Yes, sir, it is clearly the question.
Q

You go to the legislative history only if the

statute is ambiguous; is that correct?
MR, RIFFEL:

I think that is correct, yes.

I think

this Court has said time... and again that you can look at the
legis lati.ve Iii story- Q

Only if the statute is ambiguous.

MR. RIFFEL?
Q

Sure, but it still has some weight.

What about the statute is unconstitutional, the

wording of the statute?
MR, RIFFELs

The wording of the statute?

Your Honor,

in my view, if you look at the purpose of the statute—
Q

If you look at the wording—whet about the

wording is unconstitutional?
MR. RIFFEL:

The wording simply states that unless the

30
party marries someone who also received disability benefits
under Section B, that they are to be terminated.

And I think

that fails to recognize the fact that there are many recipients
who are suffering the same hardship as a result of marriage who
are disabled as are covered by the statute.
Q

Does that make it unconstitutional because it is

under-inclusive?
MR. RIFPEL:

I do not think it makes it unconstitu­

tional,. no, sir, if it is under-inelusive.

I think under

W©inberg< sr - Q

Aire you not really trying to got another

exception in the statute, to write it in?
MR. RIFPEL:

No, sir.

I think this is no more an

extension of the law then Jlminez v. Weinberger.

What wa are

saying is—
Q

Iii your case you want the statute to say that

when a person marries and is divorced, he comas back to the
original status'; is that not what you want us to write into the
statute?
MR, RIFPELs
Q

No, Your Honor.

Hew els© can we cover your man?

MR, RIFPEL:

You could just say that that statutory

schema as; applied is unconstitutional as to Mr, Jobst.
Q

To him because of his peculiar circumstances.

MR. RifPEL:

Because of his peculiar circumstances

31

and because of the peculiar circumstances of & very small
class of persons just like him whose benefits ere terminated,
who have the same continuing need for insurance benefits as
the other subclass and who are invidiously discriminated
against by effect of the statutory scheme.

I think that is

just fundamental constitutional lav? applied by this Court.
Q

You and I could agree that there might be

many such people who, after they are 18 years old, still have
the same needs of dependency.

Non-disabled children of a

deceased wage earner lose their benefits, secondary benefits,
when they reach the age of 18, unless they are students.

But

I suppose you and I could agree that many people over 18 are
in the seme economic position after their 18th birthday, one
day, as they were one day before their 18th birthday.
MR. RlFPELf

Yes, Your Honor, but I think that is a

completely different situation.

Marriage is

terminating an

event—
Q

A birthday terminatas an ©vent too.

MR, RIFFEL:

There is no question about it, yes, sir.

Numerous things can terminate.

But as to this? class of

disabled per sons I think as a reasonable empirical judgment
Congress could sfiy that as to a disabled person they very
often do not marry people capable of supporting them.

In fact,

general experience would indicato that they very often marry
people ilka themselves.

Most child’s insurance beneficiaries,

32
under -the legislative history as stated by Congress, it was
anticipated that they would have been disabled from birth,
birth defects in this case—
Q

The statute provides they must have bean

disabled before the death or disability of the wage earner,
does it not?
MR. RIFFEL:
Q

Before age 13, yes, sir.

Any time before age 18.

MR. RIFFEL:

It could be something like a car

accident or something like that.

But they were speaking of

what they anticipated to be the usual case.

For example, both

of these recipients suffer from cerebral palsey.

They have the

I have seen both of them with almost the

identical di 3aid 1.1 ty.
Q

Mr. Riffel, you started out by wmphasizing the

narrowness of the District Court holding.

Why would not the

District Court's reasoning apply equally to the widower
situation?

Assume your client were a widower who was drawing

benefits and married in one case a parson who was getting
benefits—-then his benefits would continue—in the other case
married someone who had cerebral palsey and was not receiving
benefits and not able to support the widower.

The benefit

Would it not be equally invalid under your

What termination would be equally subject to

MR. RIFFEL:

I do not think so because I think you

have just an accidental application in the case of-—it is not
very likely that the widower is going to marry another
disabled person.

And, under the statute, if a widower does

marry another—

Maybe not a disabled person, maybe just an

older parson who is too old to got a job and support him.
are talking about a man losing his benefits.

We

He could very

often marry a person of his own age who is unable to get a job
to support him, but yet this is not covered by the act.
MR. RIFFEL:

I understand that very often old people

do not marry, that they just live together because of that in
Florida and so forth.

But I think there is no such exception

as—
Q

What is the constitutional difference between

that situation and the one before us?

I do not quite follow

why you would not apply the same reasoning in both cases,
whichever way you come out, that is.
MR. RIFFEL:

I think if you look at the purposes of

the legislation, a disabled child, it is reasonable to assume,
is never going to accumulate enough work credits to receive
Social Security on his own.

He is always going t© be disabled.

It is not for a short period of time or a relatively short of
period of tine such as with an older person.
about—

We are talking

34

Q

By hypothesis.

My other example is one where

the person is just getting the secondary benefit.

By hypothesis

it is not a person who has got the Social Security benefit on
the basis of his own earnings.
MR. RIFFEL:

Where is the difference?

I think the difference is that Congress

has not recognized marriage as an exception in the casses to
which you speak, Your Honor.

In the case of child's insurance

benefits' Congress has actually said, "Look, we can see that
marriage of a person like this does not affect his dependency

on the insured wage earner." For example, Mr. Jobst's marriage
and his divorce were really unrelated, totally unrelated.
Congress recognised that.

They saw that hardship.

They

recognized the hardship of recipients, but there was a sub­
class of recipients they left out.

By koing so, by taking

this specific affirmative action, in my view under a proper
application of the 5th Amendment, you have a different
situation.

You have an actual decision, an actual recognition

stated in the statute, actually written in words, as to those
specific persons.
Q

But is there not the same statement in the

statute as to widowers who married covered spouses?

Is that

not exactly uhs same—
MR, RIFFEL:
I do not think it. is.

I do not know.

I did rot think it was.

As to a. disabled child who marries a

widower, his benefits would continue, if that is what you mean.

35

But I do not. think that a widower receiving benefits, who
marries a disabled child, necessarily continues to receive his
benefits.
Q

I thought that in all -these secondary benefit

situations, if the person who is covered marries another
person who is covered, the benefits of both continue, that that
is the overall effect,
MR, RIFFEL:
Q

That is why I suggest that the two cases really

are quits parallel.
wrong.

My mistake,

It does not mean you are necessarily

The only thing I question is whether ‘the holding is

quite as narrow as you describe it.
MR, RIFFEL:

In that ©vent it obviously could be

applied under other situations.

But I do think that the

sltuutictei is such that it could be a narrow holding.
someone else is going to come along and say,
situation."

I think

’It applies to ray

I do not think there is any question about that.

The child's insurance provisions then are a mere
restatement of the general purpose of the Social Security
benefits, and thi.it is to provide a continuing income to the
insured workar and his dependents in the event of disability,
retirement or death.

in this case, the Secretary has placed

great reliance or the premise that to promote administrative
ease in the administration of Social Security benefits this
Court should not look at this provision, should not question

36

Its constitutionality, because this provision is necessary to
©as© of administration of the act.

Under our view, when

compared with recent decisions of this case, this is not the
case»

There are, I am sure, certain presumptions which could

be established properly under this act to determine whether
Mr. Jobst

in fact does still need Social Security benefits as

a dependant of an insured worker.

But this is not a proper

classification.
For example, in the case of Weinberger v. Salfi this
Court examined a ninth month duration limitation statute which
in effect provided that a survivor and the children of that
person oE an insured worker must wait nine months following the
date of the marriage in order to be eligible for secondary
benefits as the survivors of a beneficiary.

The Court looked

at that duration requirement and compared it to the purposes of
the Social Security Act.

What the Court stated was that those

purposes wars related 'to the dependency of the insured wage
earner, that the classifications established must be measured
against the dependency of the insured wage earner established,
which was reflected by the classifications.
In that case, in the Salfi case, it was clear, one,
that Congress had stated a real concern over false claims for
benefits where individuals would marry sick insured workers
simply because they knew that person scon would be disabled,
die or retire, and therefore enable themselves to lifetime

insurance benefits.,
question.

This is not the case with child's

Congress had specifically examined this

It is stated in the legislative history that, one,

they need not be concerned with terminations of disability as
they were in the case of the other disability provisions for
insured workers, the reason being, one, this is a small class of
people»

There are not just very many disabled children

entitled to benefits.

Secondly, because of congenital problems

end so forth, in most cases the disability will be very
apparent.

When we compare this with the Saif;, case, "this is

a quite different situation which the Court is faced with than
in that case.
There i.s also the further consideration that the
standards of disability must have been very similar»

Disability

benefits under welfare statutes have bean controlled by federal
regulations under the

Social Security Act for a long time, a

long time; before ’the enactment of supplementa], security
income.

Under the supplemental security income*, program now

again the Social Security Administration has access to
informati on on those disability benefits.
find there is a further reason—that under the narrow
holding of this Court as to other disabled children, under
Section B, in most cases that disability is going to be readily
apparent.

For example, in this case she was a victim of

cerebral palsey.

She has been disabled from birth as the

record reflects and as the Social Security Administration
admitted.

Under an old line of reasoning/ going back to

Dandridgs, this classification simply is not rationally based.
On examination of more recent cases of this Court—Jiminez v.
Weinberger and Mathews v. Lucas"~this discrimination becomes
apparent.
clear.

This discrimination under Jiirdnaz v. Weinberger is

In the Jiminaz case this Court examined a presumption

in the Social Security legislation which denied illegitimate
children/ seme illegitimate children, benefits under the
Social Security Act while other illegitimate children and
legitimate children under that act were entitled to a. presump­
tion cf eligibility.

I think this case was the origin of the

over-inclusive, under-inclusive language which has sometimes
bean referred to by this Court.
At any rate, under the Jiminez opinion this Court
reversed a lower court decision which had stated that this
presumption ,*/as all right since it was intended to avoid
spurious claims, and this Court clearly said it is not
subscribed bp the 5th Amendment.

Why?

Because it is irrational,

because it is invidious, because the 5th Amendment has teeth,
because sometimes the government--maybe not intentionally, I
am sure not with an intent. Ho one sat down and said, "Ws are
going to nail John Jobst.

This guy ought to .receive welfare."

But neverthelesse by affect, that discrimination is invidious.
It is not rationally related.

39
Q

Mr. Eiffel, could I ask you one question about

the Court's relief?
MR. RIFFEL;

Yes, sir.

>

Q

As I understand the Court's order, the test of

entitlement of your client is whether his spouse was disabled.
S© that even if your spouse was disabled but not needy--say,
she was a wealthy person, had independent means—-nevertheless
he would recover? is that correct?
ME. RIFFEL;

Y©s«

He would bs precisely in the same

position as any other Social Security recipient who marries
another recipient.
Q

So that even under the Court's holding, the

test is not one of need?
MR. RIFFEL;

No, sir.

It is the identical test

applied in any Social Security case, Your Honor.
Under the later case of Mathews v. Lucas, this Court
sustained, a similar administrative aid.

Why?

Because it gave

some chance for those illegitimate children to came in and
prove they wsre still dependent.

Therefore, it was reasonably

related to tie legislative purpose and could be sustained.
this case, we submit, this case should bs affirmed.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L. URBANCZYK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. URBANCZYK:

If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, two

very short points.
First, I would like feo confirm, Mr. Justice Stevens,
*

that your unde,:standing of the act with regard to other
secondary insurance beneficiaries is correct.
take a widower.

For example,

Those provisions provide in Section 202(f)

that if the widower marries, the secondary insurance benefits
are terminated.

But then there is a savings provision in

202(f)(4) for when the insurance beneficiary

marries someone

else who is antitied to insurance benefits under th© act.
So, contrary to appellee's protestation about how
narrow this case is, I think a principle of broad application
is involved in this case.

Indead, I think it is broader than

that because the District Court's rationale, carried to its
logical ©xtrsrae, as I mentioned in my argument, I think would
require, Congress 'to tack a needs test onto all 'terminating
events such as non-disabled children reaching age 18, for
example.

It is true that there is not a congruence between

the District Court's judgment and its rationale.
Q

Let me just b© sure I understand what you are

saying because it is of seme importance to me.

You are saying

that prior to 1958 there was a flat termination when there was
a marriage; and after 1958 there are two broad categories.

One

41
if.; persons who marry other persons who are covered, and the
other classification is persons—that is, secondary bene­
ficiaries—who marry persons who are not covered,
MR. URBANCZYK:
Q
classification.

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stevens,

And you should test 'the statute on the

broad

I notice, in that event, actually when you have

a marriage between two covered persons, if you did not have the
1958 amendments, two people would be affected by the rule.
x

MR. URBANCZYK:

That is correct,

As I said, it would

cause a simultaneous termination of both of their benefits,
and that was the hardship to Congressmen concerned with it.
.Also to clarify, appellee mentioned that there was a

)
$9,000 difference in the payments.

That is covered in the

stipulation at ps.ge 15 of our appendix.

The $9,000 reflects

the amount of secondary child's insurance benefits that would
have been paid had these benefits not been discontinued,

The

Secretary ma.lnt.ains that if that money had been paid, he would
bs entitled to recoup as overpayment the amount of SSI benefits
that have: been paid.

That is approximately $3,000.

The reason

it is so low is that from 1970, when appellee married, till
1974 there were so SSI benefits.

Appellee was: receiving state

welfare insurance but not SSI.
For the reasons stated in our brief then, we
respectfully urge that the judgment of the District Court be
reversed.

Thank you.

42
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The cas3 is submitted.
