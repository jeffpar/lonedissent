0RS1L ARGUMENT OF DAVID H. FELDMAN ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR., FELDMAN:
tie Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

In the case now before you, the petitioner, the

president of the University of Maryland, urges this Court to
preserve :.he rational system of assigning tuition to students
that prevails at most public colleges and universities across
the Nation.

Following the 1973 decision of this Court in

Viandis v. Kline public institutions of higher education
adopted new policies for determining students' admission,
tuition rates and other charges.

The policies adopted by

the University of Maryland and most other publicly supported
schools look not only to the domicile of the students in
✓
granting preferential in-state status, but also are predicated
on a number of legitimate grounds for according differential
wn; iteration ;.n defining who is entitled to the benefit of
lower fees.

Thus, while the policy at. the University of

1 rAland generally looks to who is financially responsible for
bearing a student's educational and other costs and then looks
to the: domicile; of that person, whether it be the student,

hi.3 parent:, or spouse, in order zo accommodate the legitimate
interest served by the policy, it recognizes that variations
from general applications are both necessary and appropriate.
t

For example, both resident students and permanent
resident aliens can and do qualify for in-state status at the
University of Maryland.

By contrast nonresident citizens and

non-immigrant aliens are denied preferential treatment.
Similarly, the university's policy denies its benefits to a
group of citizens whose association with and contributions to
che State are likely to be minimal and transitory, specifically
to those member3 of the armed forces who come to the university
not by choice bit by assignment for educational purposes.
In Ms ' 1975 respondents, three undergraduate students
at the University of Maryland, filed this action for declaratory
and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for

*
the

District of Maryland.

on his father,

m employee of

Each was financially dependent
an international bank in Washington,

D..C., vrho held, as did his child, a non-immigrant G-4 visa.
G-4 non-immigrant visas are given to officers or employees of
international organizations and the members of their immediate
families.

As or:® seeking to be a non-immigrant alien, a person

applying for a. G-4 visa must state under oath the purpose and
length of his intended stay in the United States, can be
admitted for only such time and under such conditions as the
Attorney General, may by regulations prescribe and is required

5
by the applicable regulations to agree to abide by all the
terms and conditions of his mission and to depart at the
expiration of the period of his admission or the abandonment
of his authorized non-immigrant status.

Such non-immigrants

are decisively disqualified by Federal lav; from establishing
a permanent residence in this country because the Immigration
and Naturalization Act accords the privilege of residing
permanently i i the United States only to aliens lawfully
admitted for permanent residence.
In the district court? represented by counsel retained
by the international bank for which their fathers worked,
respondents urged that the university's policy of denying in­
state status to the holders of G-4 non-immigrant visas or
those financi illy dependent on the holders of G-4 —
QUESTIONS

What do you mean by "permanent residence

That is a term of our immigration laws.

That means you can

stay as long is you. — forever, if you wanted.
ME. FELDMAN2

That is correct.

That is a reference

to Section 11)1 (a) (20) of title XX of the United States Code.
QUESTIONS

You will get to it.

But that probably

doesn't have boo much connection with domiciles.
MR. FELDMAN:

If the Court please, I think it has

been suggested, bote by the Court's majority opinion in
Nyqur.s t v. Marne let last term and particularly by Mr. Justice
Rahnquist's dissent in that case that aliens who are non-

6
immigrants are under a disability from being domiciled in this
country or at least most categories of aliens

who are non­

immigrants , and for that matter, that is a factor which is
conceded by the respondents in this case, as I will note later
during the argument.
Respondents urged in the district, court that the
university’s policy of denying ' in-state status to them vio­
lated

the due process and equal protection clauses of the

14th amendment.

The district court held in July 1976 that the

university'fes policy as applied to G-4 non-immigrant visa
holders created a permanent irrebuttable presumption of nondomicile in violation of the due process clause and thus -the
district court did not reach the equal protection claim now
reasserted here by the respondents.
QUESTION:

Your position is that the United States

h'iz rover admitted these people for permanent residence.
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Only temporary.

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that is clear from the

conditions of their admission to this country, both by virtue
of their non-imjiigrant status and by virtue: of the regulations
prescribed by the Attorney General requiring -them to depart
at the conclusion of their authorised admission.
QUESTION:

Are they authorized to become citizens?

Could they apply for citizenship.'whixe they are in this status?

7

MR. FI:L'OMAN:

They would not be authorized to apply for

citizenship while in the status.

They would be required to

adjust their status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent residence and then they would be subject to the fiveyear requirement.
QUESTION:

They could always apply, but they could

not become citizens, you say, while they are in this status.
MRFiELDMAN:

That is correct.

The district court relied upon Viandis v. Kline in
its unvarnished state, that is, without reference to this
Court’s numerous decisions dealing with State classifications
where other irrebuttable presumptions not affecting fundament 1
rights -QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, you say Viandis in its unvarnished
\

state.

At least your alternate position here, is it not, is

than this case i:

different from Viandis v. Kline?

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, it is our position in this case

that even if VIandis had not been reinterpreted by Weinberger
v. Saif5. and subsequent decision of this Court, that the
presumption said to be at issue in this case, one, is not
permanent in the sense of Viandis

/. Kline, and, two, entirely

apart from that, that the presumption said to be at issue is
universally true and therefore not prohibited under Viandis v.
Kline.
QUESTION:

In other words, you would be saying that

for purposes of Maryland in-state tuition regulations, a non

8
immigrant ali in. simply by definition can’t qualify»
MR. FELDMANs
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is the position

And if you made your entitlement by

domicile, by definition

Maryland can se.y that you can

never be domiciled here because of the Federal law.
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is our position.

Therefore, a Viandis type inquiry, at

least under this hypothesis, would shed no light on anything
that the State uses in making its decision,
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think the 'Viandis type inquiry

does not preclude the State from showing that there are
legitimate policy objectives of the State in constructing
its policy and in essentially defining domicile in such a way
as to preclude these persons consistent with Federal law.
QUESTION:

The presumption is always true — as my

Brother Rehnquist says, presumption is always true, so there is
no violation.
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is —

When I said Viandis type inquiry, I meant

the type of inquiry mandated in Viandis to consider individual
circumstances.

Your position is that nothing that such an

inquiry would turn up would do these particular respondents
any good because they are by rule forbidden from acquiring
in-state tuition status.
MR. FELDMAN:

That would be true only so long as those

9
persons did not. adjust their status to that of an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence,.
QUESTION;

Mr» Feldman, in that connection, I want

to be sure I 'understand your position.

As I understood your

brief, you indicate that the university8s policy simply tracks
the State law of domicile, the Maryland law of domicile, that
under Maryland law a G-4 alien or somebody in his family could
not be domiciled in Maryland because they could never have
the necessary intent required by Maryland law to be a
domiciliary thereof.
Now, if it were shown by an authoritative decision
of the Maryland courts that the Maryland law is other than
what you undare :and it to be and represent it to be, would the
university change its policy to conform to the then clear
Maryland lav? or would it persist in continuing in the present
policy?
MR. FELDMAN:

I think ic is entirely possible that

the university would change its policy.

However, I think

petitioner *.s position in the matter would be that -.die
university would still not be required to change the policy,
the reason being that there are other legitimate objectives
of the policy such as cost equalisation and according
preferential treatment only to those who are liable for payment
of the full spectrum of State taxes.
QUESTION:

Then you would have a Viandis case.

10
I:; the university purports to differentiata a tuition between
domiciliaries and nondomiciliaries and if it were shown that
G-4s could become domiciliaries of Maryland and if nonetheless
you prevented any G-4 from ever having the lower tuition
rates, you would clearly have'a Viandis case, wouldn31 you?
MR. FELDMAN:

That would be true only if the

university's only objective in having its policy was determining
domicile.

The point that I have been trying to make to your

Honor is that there are other legitimate policy objectives
which are taken into account in the university's construction
of it's policy.
QUESTION:

Did I misapprehend your brief when I

thought you we::e saying that you no more than were following
the law of Maryland as to domicile and that under that lav;
a G-4 could never become a domiciliary of Maryland?
MR. FELDMAN:

That is the position of the university,

but it is further the position of petitioner in this case
that that is not the only basis on which the university's
policy rests,
QUESTION:

May I go back a moment, Mr. Feldman.

t'ou don't give us any Maryland judicial decisions, at least
any dispositive, which hold that G-4s can't establish
Maryland domic, le, do you?
MR. FELDMAN:
way or the other.

There are no Maryland decisions one

11
QUESTION:

Did you resist the effort to certify

to your court of appeals that question?
MR. FELDMAN:

No.

On the contrary, in the district

court and further briefed in the Court of Appeals of the
Fourth Circuit, the university took, the position that the
Federal courts should abstain on the question of whether
persons holding G-4 visas were in fact capable of acquiring
Maryland domicile in favor of a decision of the Maryland court.
QUESTION:
Court?

Do you persist with that position in this

I gather your certixxcation rule, notwithstanding

what happened in the lower courts
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

we could still certify it.

Yes, this Court could do that.

What is your position about that?

Should

we or should ie not?
MR. FELDMAN;

I am not urging the Court to dc that

principally because I think -tie university's —
QUESTION:

Do you object to our doing it?

MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Certainly not.

Mr. Feldman, if there were to be

certification, should the question be what is the general
Ms.ry.land law of: domicile or what policy is the university
permitted to adopt with respect to in-state tuition fees under
the law

of Maryland?
MS. FELDMAN:

I think it should probably be the

latter question because the policy of the university does try

to take account, of other factors in addition to domicile in
determining v; ho appropriately is entitled to the benefit of
lower tuition fees.

I think the difficulty, however, that

is potentially raised with certifying the second question is
that it essent?ally asks the Court of Appeals of Maryland to
make what I world suggest to the Court is a policy decision
which is more properly entrusted, to the regents of the
university.
QUESTIONS

But wouldn't the certification simply ask

the Maryland lourt of Appeals whether the

regents had the

authority under Maryland law to make that decision?
MR. FELDMAN;

If that were the question certified

to the court, I would submit that that would be entirely
appropriate.
QUESTION;

Mr. Feldman, let me just clarify one

tiring in my own mind.

You suggest that the present rule may

rest either on the domicile test or on these other considera­
tions, such as paying the full range of taxes.

Is it not

correct that the rule that is actually at issue is ore cased
on. domicile only?
MR. FSLDMaN:

If the Court please, and if your Honor,

Mr., Justice Stevens please..• that is not entirely the case,
and the proof of that is seen by reference to the university’s
general policy -which is reprinted, in the brief of petitioner
at page 7.

And first I might note that it is the general

13
pci icy which is described 'there* not only the focused sole
reason for what the policy is.

But in that regard I would

refer the Court to paragraph 1, subsection

d , which in a

list of classes to which in-state status is accorded, indicates
that such status is available where a student who is a member
of the armed forces of the United States is stationed on active
duty in Maryland for at least six consecutive months immediately
prior to the last day available for registration for the
forthcoming semester, unless such student has been assigned
for educational purposes to attend the University of Maryland.
I would submit that such a student assigned for
educational purposes to the University of Maryland might well
himself have been before entering the service and while in the
service a domic-liary of Maryland, but the regents have taken
the position in that case that since the Federal Government
is bearing the cost of the student's education and in particular
a military department of the Federal Government, that in that
instance

is not appropriate to accord in-state fees without

reference to domicile.
QUESTION:

I think that is a —

I was under the impression, and i may not

have completely followed that, that every person who could
establish that he or she was a domiciliary of Maryland would be
treated as an ir.-state applicant.
MR. FELDMAN:

That is only correct insofar as the

general classification is concerned.

It is not true in the

.14

instance of those military assigned for educational purposes
-ather than coning by choice.

It is further not true in the

case of non-immigrant aliens, the overwhelming majority of
which, if not all of which, we believe to be under a legal
disability from being domiciled in the State.
But the basis with respect to non-immigrant aliens
is as to those, for example, on student visas, who are on
other transitory stays in the United States, that their
relationship to the State and their liability for the full
payment of State taxes, if any, will be fleeting at most so
that in the long run their contribution to the university
will not be particularly great.
In the case of G-4 non-immigrant visa holders and
diplomats,, for example, who would be a similar category, such
persons are under no liability to pay Federal, or State income
taxation, and because of their non-liability for payment of
the full spectrum of taxes, their contributions to the
university in the long run would be minimal as well.
QUESTION:
differently.

Let me put the question just a little

if we did certify to the domiciliary issue to

die Court of Appeals in Maryland and they came back with an
answer that e. person with a G-4 visa is capable of forming
the requisite attempt to establish domicile, what would happen
i:.i this case?
MR. FELDMAN:

I think the odds are reasonably high

15
t. ;at. ohe caso would become moot because the university would
change its policy, but that judgment is one that would be made
by the regents, and I have suggested previously and I would
again that I think it is well within the discretion of the
regents in terms of —
QUESTION“

You say you could change its poliov„

Wouldn't it just apply it's existing policy and say that some
of these people .

would, then be eligible to be considered?

MR. FELDMAN:

It would not, because the existing

policy specifically precludes from eligibility persons not
United States citizens or alien." lawfully admitted for
permanent residence.

That preamble to the language is part

of the first paragraph of the general policy as currently

written.

The: general policy as currently written says it is

the policy of the university to grant in-state status for
admission, tuition and charge-differential purposes to United
Scates citizens and to immigrant aliens lawfully admitted for
permanent residence: in accordance with the laws of the United
States, in the following cases, and then" they are listed.
So there still would be a requirement of the policy being
amended.
I tried to suggest previously by one of my remarks
that we believe Viandis v. Kline

not to be the same case as

it was in 1973 in any event and that the university's policy's
premises need lot be universally crue or percect and

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, I am sorry to take so much

time, but really, I don't understand.

I read paragraph l.a.

of that paragraph, and why, if the Maryland court told us that
the parents were domiciled and the child, why doesn't l.a.
entitle the student to admission?
MR. FELDMAN:

Because l.a. is a specific subcategory

of 1, which limits a. and specifically says it is only a policy
with respect to United States citizens and to immigrant
aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, and the
G-4s are neither of those categories.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. FELDMAN:

I am sorry.

As this Court indicated list term in

\,

Califano v. Jobst, State classifications are not gauged
properly by focusing on selected atypical examples of the class.
Starting with Weinberger v. Saifi in 1975, two years before,
a long unbroken line of this Court's decisions makes clear
that State classifications not affecting fundamental rights
do not create unconstitutional irrebuttable presumptions or
otherwise violate the Due Pocess Clause if rationally related
to legitimate governmental objectives.

Obviously a claim of

a preferred tuition rate, whether or not the excess is paid by
a parent's international bank employer, does not involve a
basic human liberty or fundamental constitutional right and
thus the many legitimate grounds proffered by petitioner in
this case are more than sufficient.

i

17
Before discussing these rational bases, perhaps a
word or two should be said about Salfi.

Salfi involved an

irrebuttable presumption in the Social Security Act which
effectively held marriages lasting less than nine months to
be shams and denied benefits.

Absent from the Court’s opinion

was any language of strict scrutiny or least restrictive
alternative, and the focus was upon Starns v. Mai leer son
where the Court said what we believe should be restated in
tills case, benefits here are available upon compliance with
an objective criterion, one which the legislature considered
to bear a sufficiently close nexis with underlying policy
objectives to be used as a test for eligibility.
Like the plaintiffs in Starns, appellees are
completely free to present evidence that they meet the specified
requirements.

Failing in this effort, their only constitutional

claim is that she test that they cannot meet is not so rationally
related to a legitimate legislative objective that it can be
used to deprive them of benefits available to those who do
satisfy the test.
later

And in the Usary v. Turner case a year

the Court indicated that whether or not a classification

stated an irrebuttable presumption on its face was irrelevant
when its operation and effect were completely permissible.
Similarly, in Califano v. Jobst and the Massachusetts
Board of Retirement v. Murgia cases of last year and the year
before, the Court sustained

what were obvious facial or

18
otherwise irre:>uttc:.ble presumptions despite the fact that in
Jiirgia an administrative device existed but was not used in
annual physical examination to inquire into the factual matter
that was presumed, namely, that policemen -//ere unfit to serve
at age 50.

Oust how little is left of the irrebuttable

presumption doctrine was made clear by Mr, Justice Biackmun
opinion for a unanimous Court in Ohio Bureau of Employment
Services vr Kadori from last term, a case not cited in any
of the briefs before this Court in this case but one which we
now believe to be particularly relevant.

There a three-judge

court had invalidated on equal protection and due process
grounds an. Ohio statute denying unemployment compensation
other than because-of a lockout of an employer.

In reversing

the district court, this Court noted the legitimate interests
of the State in preserving the integrity of its fund and
dismissed the irrebuttable presumption claim in a footnote
stating,

'This argument requires several assumptions.

First,

appellee must assume that the purpose of the statute is to
measure innocence.

Then he must assume that the disqualifica­

tion provision represents a presumption that any person laid
off due to a strike is not innocent.

If the statute is

designed to serve any purpose other than measuring innocence,
appellee's implication of an irrebuttable presumption fails."
As we discussed below, the statute clearly has
purposes other than measuring innocence of the disqualified

19

worker.
Similarly, the policies of the University cf Maryland and
of

most other public institutions of higher education which

deny in-state status to non-immigrant aliens had a number of
purposes other than the measure of domicile.

These policies

effect, a reasonable decision to equalise the cost of college
and university training between those with continuing liability
to support public higher education by paying the full spectrum
of State taxes and those, such as non-immigrant employees of
the international banks,who do not have that obligation.
Tuition payments at public institutions of higher education
represent only a portion of true costs and the amount available
for state-subsidized educational benefits is not limitless.
QUESTION;
what.

Mr. Feldman, did the district court find

the Maryland law was with respect to domicile?
MR, FELDMAN:

The district court took the position

that under the Maryland law of domicile, G-4s were not
precluded from
QUESTION:

The district court has already answered

the question that there has been a suggestion that should bo
certified, to the Maryland courts?
MR. FELDMAN:

It has answered the first question that

Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested was a possibility, namely, whether
as a matter of theory G-4s could foe so classified.

It did

answer bis second question, whiqjf I think he suggested was

20

the preferred question.
QUESTION:

The district court, though, says as it

understands Maryland law, G-4s are not forbidden or not
precluded from becoming domiciliaries.
MR. FELDMAN:

That was the district court's

conclusion, that is correct.
i

QUESTION:

And you disagree with that interpretation

of Maryland law I take it.
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is also correct, your Honor.

Let's assume we were just bound to take

the district court's view of Maryland law, we should just
affirm, shouldn't we?
MR. FELDMAN:

No, I don't believe that to be the case

And that is the: point I am trying to make now, namely, that
flie university 's policies serve many purposes other than
measuring domicile, and I am trying to get to those in the
few brief seconds that I have.
QUESTION:

Did the district court — it didn’t

reach those questions.
MR. FELDMAN:

That is right, because on the district

court's finding, it determined that there was a permanent
irrebuttable presumption under Viandis that was not universally
true without reference to the later cases which cast doubt on
those requirements„
QUESTION:

Wasn't your position also that the

21

university’s rule is not necessarily the same as the Maryland
law of domicile ?
MR. FELDMAN:
Rehnquist.

That is entirely correct,, Mr. Justice

That is our position,, because the policy serves

other purposes, is clearly intended to serve other purposes.
QUESTION:

And the district court didn't treat that

aspect, did they?
MR. FELDMAN:

No, the district court never reached

those questions because -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
minutes left now to make that point.
MR. FELDMAN;

You have only about four
You better proceed to it.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The university's policy in addition to favoring those
with continuing liability to support public higher education
by the payment of the full spectrum of state taxes also
encourages the even-handed and efficient administration of its
in-state determination and appeals process, limiting hearings
for its 550 non-immigrant students to the objective criterion
of changes in their immigration status and reducing the need
for

all-blown hearings, many inquiring interpreters.

If

respondents! arguments are accepted, the university’s rational
dividing line will give way principally in favor of employees
described recently by a Senate committee as possessors of
cine-cures

where extraordinarily high salaries are common place

and pursuit of fringe benefits has been raised to a form of art.

22

It is the less fortunate categories of G-4 aliens that would be
left out in the cold if respondents' arguments are accepted.,
The university's policy and those of most other public
institutions serve all the purposes noted.

They do not measure

domicile only or view it in a vacuum -QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, I don't understand how it

serves the policy of encouraging the payment of taxes.

These

people are not. going to pay taxes no matter what the university
does .
MR. FELDMAN:

The university's policy as a general

matter -QUESTION:

Do you think someone is going to pay or not

pay his taxes depending on the result of this case?
MR. FELDMAN:

Ho.

The point that I am trying to make,

Mr. Justice Stevens, is that those persons who are given
preferential treatment by the university are those liable for
the fill spectrum of State taxes, whereas those who are not
favored, out-of-staters, non-immigrant aliens, those who pass
through the State for short periods or, in the case of the G-4s,
are not liable for taxes, don't receive the benefit for that
reason, because the State is already subsidizing them by not
charging them income taxes.
QUESTION:

In the case of any permanent resident alien

or any citizen, the question of whether or not he pays any raxes
is totally irrelevant to your standards of whether he is

admitted,

Isn't, that, true?
MR. FELDMAN:

It is not totally irrelevant because it

is generally those persons who are liable for the full spectrum
of taxes who are given the preferential treatment.

It is true

that the policy does not look in individual cases as to whether
an individual has in fact paid those taxes or is in fact
li.abls for them

because he has made enough money.

QUESTION:

Have not our cases taken note of the fact

that they a.re liable for taxes, liable for military duty if
they are here as permanent residents?
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, that is specifically the point

that was made in Nyguist v. Mauclet.
QUESTION:

Would these people be subject to compulsory

military service if we —
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:
law would be.

No, these people would not be —

We don't know? we don’t know what the

We don’t have it.

MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

These people I think it is clear —

If we require Congress to enact another

law and we don't know what that law could possibly be, how cculd
we possibly know?
QUESTION:

On the basis of the past law you are

certainly entitled to make that representation if that s your
view of the matter.
MR. FELDMAN:

I think it is clear that under the

24
present law, persons who are here on G-4 visas are not liable
for military service or not liable for Federal or State —
QUESTION:

There is no compulsory military service

now, of course„
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

That would be true even if —

Your position is that on the law as it

last was before the change, they would not be liable for
military service.
MR. FELDMAN:

That is correct.

I believe my time is up.

I am sorry that I haven't

gotten to the one or two other points that I hoped to make, but
I would be happy to respond to your questions.
QUESTION:

Am I under a misapprehension, but are

there not immigrant aliens who enjoy income tax immunity and
nevertheless able to qualify as in-state students in Maryland?
MR. FELDMAN:

’I think it is true that there are

immigrant aliens who enjoy income tax liability.

MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, I didn't hear you.

Who enjoy income tax immunity.

MR. FELDMAN:

I misspoke myself, I am sorry.

I

think it is true there are immigrants who enjoy immunity and
in fact in this: particular case, it is the position of
respondents that even were they to adjust their status to that

25
of lawfully admitted for permanent residence, that if they
continue to work for the international banks, they would still
not tse subject to Federal or State income taxation.

And I

think, the only point to be made with respect to that is that
if you focus in on that, you are focusing in on the atypical
examples which this Court indicated were not pertinent in
Califano v. Jobst, and as a general matter non--immigrants are
subject to the full spectrum of taxes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Scanlan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED L. SCANLAN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SCANLAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The three young students at the University of

Maryland and their family,

I think, who were named as plaintiffs

in this case and respondents in this Court are typical of most
of the members of the class for which I speak today.

Their

parents have owned property in Maryland ranging from 7 to 15
yours.

They pa 7 every single tax levied by the State of Maryland

except the income tax on their salaries which they cannot do
because by international agreement, treaty,

if you will, that

income is exempt from Federal and State income taxation.
They have lived here many years.

and. parochial, without interruption.
One of them has a. mother who is an American citizen

and can vote . r.. American elections.

They have no property —

their parents, I mean — no property back home, with one
exception.

There is a small bank account in England that pays

insurance.
QUESTION:

Would it make any difference to this case

if they had a million dollar estate out in the country somewhere?
TR. SCANLANs

Well, I could see where there would be

a difference in the ability to show domicile if you had a
chateau in Bolivia and returned there every year.

But ail we

are asking for, your Honor, is the opportunity, just the
opportunity, to prove domicile.
The university says, "No, you are not going to have
that opportunity; you have a G-4 visa, and that's the end of
the matter."
Now, prior to September 1973 the policy was a
rational policy.

If you owned and occupied real estate in the

State of Maryland, you satisfied the test.

Education Act which gave tuition grants and scholarships and
low-interest loans to American citizens, to people who had
applied for citizenship, and to people who were willing to

struck down.

It’s the subcategory of aliens, despite New York’s

argument that it only discriminated against a heterogeneous
class, despite that argument in New York, this Court held the
subcategory of aliens was a suspect class.

I think it said

something along the lines that the policy in that case,

the

New York education aid, in this case the implication of nonresidency and non-domicile, is directed at aliens only and only
aliens are haraed by it.

The fact that it doesn’t cut against

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Scanlan, do you think we

ought to certify this to the. Court of Appeals of Maryland to
find out. whether or not G-4 immigrants can acquire domicile in
Maryland?
MR. iCANLA'N:

No, Mr. Justice Brennan, I don’t,
In the court below, they asked the

to being withdrawn at any time?
MR. SCANLAN:

Permanent and present are two different words.
MR. SCANLAN:

As

among the categories of aliens,

Mr. Justice Marshall, among the category of non-permanent
aliens— there are a number of categories.

Many of them have

to sign the fact — the visas that they have say they havte
to maintain a residence abroad which they have no intention of
abandoninc.
Our aliens, and a few others like corporate executives
and the foreign media and I believe the treaty traders, don't
have to say that, so they can have an intention to stay
permanently in the United States even though they should lose
their job.

MR. SCANIAN:

If the

Court is going to overturn the irrebuttable presumption
doctrine or the Court is going to say that somehow Viandis
is not. applicable to this

case — residence there, domicile

here, I don't see the difference — but assume that the Court
says for some reason that eludes me that Viandis is not
applicable or should be overturned, the Court must still face
up to the fact that Nyquist v. Mauclet says you can't dis­
criminate against a subclass of aliens, and we have a subclass
of aliens,

As a matter of fact, our people probably could

at the Bank, then can petition for adjustment to permanent
status, because at that time, in that event, when they are about
to retire and they have a pension coming, they don't have to
secure a labor certification form.
That brings me to a point that the university has
made from the beginning.

Just change your status, that is all

you have to do, become a permanent alien.

What's so tough

about that.?
We jointed out from the beginning to them what they

Aren't all. those things indications of

MR. SCANLAN:

Well, I think the functional privileges

are necessary for them to perform their functions as inter­

But the critical thing in domicile always is the intention.

I am not saying, your Honor, that everybody in all
these other categories --QUESTION:

Let me- pursue it just a moment, if I may.

I had in mind the Dietz case a couple of years ago where the
Court said that you don't have to treat all aliens as citizens,
but you may draw a line somewhere along the spectrum of alien
agency.

Some are close enough to being citizens that we will

let them in, and you just have to pick a line somewhere.
Now, you would not say — I take it you are saying
your people are enough like permanent residents so they ought
to be treated that way, but you don't say the children of
Ambassadors are or a little farther down the line wouldn't have
to be.
Isn’t :.t t rue that the university is entitled to draw
some line and when you get real clpse to that line, it's going
to have an appearance of arbitrariness.

MR. SCANLAN;

Because then you are right back on

the equal protection point.

The Mathews v< Diaz case, written

by your Honor, involved the Federal power.

And the Court,

speaking through you, Mr. Justice Stevens, made it perfectly
clear in that case and again in Nyguist the Federal Government
can have powers of classification over aliens and subclasses
of aliens that is denied the States, because the Federal power
is also based cn the foreign relations policy of this country,
which is none of the business of the States, much less the
University of Maryland.

That really doesn't quite respond to -the

would not have to admit all aliens, say, illegal aliens or

MR. SCANLAN:

Well, I — let me put it this wav.

The Ambassador class, the diplomatic class, their privileges

the representative theory and the extraterritoriality theory.
One, they represent the sovereign, their sovereign, Nicaragua;
or, two, they are an extension of Nicaraguan territory.

Stanley

Well, it's also like the hearing in

— not the hearing in Stanley

where there was

— in the Burson v. Bell

a pre-suspension of license hearing, but that

42
hearing was meaningless in the case of a non-insured driver,,
and the Court, held having made the fact of liability critical
m that case,

t was unfair, violated due process, call it

an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption, if you will/ and
that was wrong,
I am not saying there are many cases.

It's only in

a case where the conclusive presumption is apparent*

in

Viandis on the face of the statute and here in the obvious
administration of the policy by the university where it is
apparent on the face.

In that case, yes.

I am not urging

that the Court go ferret out irrebuttable presumptions.

That

would be indeed substantive interference masquerading in a
procedural dress, and I am not urging it where the course of
individual determinations would be prohibitive or costly.
That isn't the case here.

We already had

the hearings.

We are only talking about my small class, 53 children
at the University of Maryland, 53.

That 500 figure obviously

involves student visa people who have to maintain a. residence
that they have no intention of abandoning.

And I am not saying

we should have irrebuttable presumptions that are wrong when
there is no other better alternative way to determine the
natter.

1 think it is perfectly valid to have age classifica­

tions for driving license, voting rights, and drinking rights
and maybe bar examinations for tasting lawyers.

And I am not

saying that we should have irrebuttable presumptions where

43

that wouldn't be any better qualified method to determine the
ultimate fact, like your Honor mentioned in Saifi, the marital
intent, the life expectancy, knowledge of terminal illness.
We are all uncertain with respect to those matters, perhaps
no better determined in an individual hearing than by an
irrebuttafcle presumption.
But leaving those situations aside,! say that the
Viandis type of irrebuttable presumption is proper; 1 say we
come four-square within Viandis.

If the Court is going

tc jettison Viandis, that is another matter.
they should.

I don't think

I think the irrebuttable presumption, contrary

tc the charge made about our analysis of it, is not dishonest.
It's a principal constitutional analysis that has applicability
and can reconcile the cases that this Court has decided.
But, finally, after all -that about Viandis, whether
Viandis controls, doesn't control, or is tc be overruled, I
say ilyguist v. hauclet controls and the alienist problem is
in this case, has been in it from the beginning.

We are

entitled to raise it here, have raised it I:ere.
I thank you.
