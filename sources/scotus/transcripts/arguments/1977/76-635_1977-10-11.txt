MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 76-633, United States Steel Corporation against
Multistate Tax Commission.
Mr. Griswold, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal from a three-judge
district court in the Southern District of New York.
The question involved is the constitutional validity, particularly under Article I, section 10 but also under
: ?•

the Commerce Clause

and the Due Process Clauses of the

Constitution, of the Multistate Tax Compact and of the
Appellee, the Multistate Tax Commission, which administers
g

the Compact.

::

\■

...

The text of the Multistate Tax Compact is set
forth at pages 54 through 79 of the white-bound Appendix to
the Jurisdictional Statement,

I may say that the record in

this case is really contained in two documents, the papers
which we filed in connection with the jurisdictional state­
ment and that includes the text of the Multi s tate
Compact at pages

Ta>:

to 79 and then the brown-covered

4
Appendix in which we did not undertake to reprint those
things which had already been put before the Court.
At the time this suit was brought, 21 states were
members of the Compact.

Since that time, four states,

Illinois, Florida, Wyoming and Indiana, have withdrawn from
the Compact while two states, California and South Dakota,
have joined it.
Thus, there are now 19 states members of the Com­
pact.
The basic question arises under Article I, Section
10 of the Constitution in language which I am sure would
have seemed clear to Mr. Justice Black, that "No state shall
$
without the consent of Congress, enter into any agreement, or
compact with another state."
The simple fact is that Congress has never given
this consent to the Multistate Tax Compact, though that
Compact went into effect, by its terms, when seven states had
joined it on August 4th, 1967, now more than 10 years ago.
As indicated by the references on page 10 of our
main brief, the blue-covered brief, the consent of Congress
has been sought repeatedly bat has never bean granted.
QUESTION:

Has it ever gotten out of a committee

or —■ has it ever been voted
MR. GRISWOLD:

I do not believe it has ever gotten

out of any committee nor been passed by either House.

QUESTION:

But it has never been voted down on

any —
MR, GRISWOLD:

It has never been voted down.

The

consent has never been granted.
QUESTION;

Has this Court ever had occasion to

address the question of whether an agreement from which a
state could withdraw at any time was a compact within the
meaning of the clause you are relying on?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, there are -- no,

I am not sure that this Court has ever dealt with that ques«

tion.

I can only say that Congress has dealt with it in a

hundred to a hundred and fifty instances and has ratified
compacts from which states could withdraw.
Certainly, the practical construction is that
that is the practical construction by the legislative
branches, that that is a compact within the meaning of the
Article I, section 10.
The Three-judge District Court held that the con­
sent of Congress was not prerequisite to the validity of this
compact.

It also found no msrit in the Commerce Clause and

Due Process Clause arguments and accordingly, it granted a
motion for a summary judgment in favor of the Appellees.
An appeal was taken and this Court noted probable
jurisdiction on February 22n3.
Beyond the apparent clarity of the constitutional

6

language, we rely on the substance of the constitutional pro­
vision.

This substance is. I think, given meaning by the

long-continued practice of Congress and the states in giving
effect to the constitutional provision.
In order to put that practice before the Court,
we have included two rather lengthy appendices in our main
brief.

This is the somewhat dark blue brief.
These appear at pages 53 through 120 of the blue-

covered brief.

The first of these, beginning on page 53,
*

lists in chronological order every compact to which Congress
has given its consent from the beginning through the Year
1976.

These are listed by title and with their statutory

citations.

There are something like 150 of them.
I may say that on page 53 there are a number of

typographical corrections
tion to.

I would call the Court's atten­

In the first place, the first compact listed,

Virginia and Kentucky Compact and the second and third from
the last one listed, Virginia and West Virginia Debt Agree­
ment; Virginia and West Virginia Boundary Agreements of 1866
I do not think are compacts at all and I think we should not
have listed them.
The first one is the act admitting Kentucky to the
Union and the second and third from the bottom are two acts
connected with the admission of West Virginia to the Union.
In the second supplement, we printed a list

compiled by the Council of State Governments in a publication
which it put out in 1966 and this lists the compacts up to
that time in alphabetical order.
To some extent, it duplicates the list which we
have in the first supplement but the second list also gives
additional information, particularly a list of references to
the states 'which are parties to the several compacts.

As I

have said, it only goes through 1866.Since we were reprinting
it from another publication, we did not feel free to make
insertions of the additional ones but the compacts to which
Congress has given its consent since 1966 are set out in
chronological order on pages 68 through 70 of the first
supplement,
And finally, we have included on page 121 a list
derived from the Council of State Governments publication
showing the compacts which ware in operation ir. 1966 which
had not received the consent of Congress.
QUESTION:

Now, where at page 121?

QUESTION:

The last page of the blue book.

MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, after the blue slip.

Some of these compacts may be invalid for the lack
of that consent.

I would mention particularly the Southern

Regional Education Compact which was, in its origin and effort
to get around this Court's decision in the Gaines case in­
volving the education of a negro outside of Missouri when

8

Missouri maintained a law school for white students exclu­
sively.
The House passed a joint resolution of consent.
The Senate debated it extensively over a period of several
days and eventually voted to recommit the bill by a vote of
38 to 37 after a suggestion had been made that

adoption of

the consent resolution would amount to an approval by Con­
gress of the segregation which was implicit in the compact.
In that connection, I would call attention to the
fact that the Western Regional Education Compact was con­
sented to by Congress in IS 53, only five years later.

No

question of segregation was involved there.
Prom this listir g, it appears that Congress has
given its consent to a wide range of compacts between the
several statas and that it has given its consent to a very
high proportion of the compacts, more than 90 percent, which
have been put into operation.
Many of the compacts to which Congress has con­
sented -QUESTION:
me.

Why c'.on’t you — Mr. Griswold, excuse

You just mentioned, a few moments ago, the Southern

Regional Educational Compac t and you told us that it may be
that several, if not all oi the compacts that have not
received Congressional approval that are listed on page 121,
supplement C of this brief, may be invalid.

3

Then I looked at page 111 which is, I guess,
Appendix B to this brief, supplement B to this brief -—
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Page 111.

MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Page which?

Yes.

Just to cross-refer to the Southern

Regional Education Compact and I noticed that it stated there,
"Congressional consent:

Not required.'5

Whose judgment is

that?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, that is the opinion of the

Council of State Governments.
QUESTION:
MR

I see,

GRISWOLD:

That is what I wanted to know.

It represents the same point of

view which is represented by the Appellees in this case.
That has no -QUESTION:

That is not yoUr submission?

MR, GRISWOLD:

That is not my opinion.

We have

reprinted here this list from the publicaion on interstate
compacts put out. by the Council of the State Governments in
1966 simply because we thought it would be convenient for the
Court and certainly without endorsing those statements.
QUESTION:

That was my question.

On several of

these it says, "Congressional consent not required."

But

that is not — you are not submitting that, as yours.
MR,, GRISWOLD:

That is simply reprinting the

10

listing made by the Council, of State Governments.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, does that not suggest,

though, that perhaps compacts may be submitted

for ratifi­

cation where, in the opinion of the submitting states, rati­
fication may not be required but they just do it in an excess
of caution?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes.

Yes, it does and it also

suggests, I think, that the time has come when this Court
should clarify when it is necessary to submit compacts for -QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Griswold, on that same thing,

were all of these compacts listed in Supplement C at 121
actually submitted to the Congress?
MR. GRISWOLD:

That I do not know, Mr. Justice.

I do know that the Southern Regional Education Compact was
submitted to the Congress.
others were.

I do not know whether any of the

In fact, I am sura that the interpleader compact

was not because I remember working with Professor Chaffee in
the development of that compact and that is ,an agreement for
opening up jurisdiction of courts.

Conceivably it should

have been submitted.
QUESTION:
a compact?

Do any of the uniform laws fall within

The many uniform laws that have been —*
MR. GRISWOLD:

Oh, there is no question that uni­

form laws are not compacts.

They can be enacted and repealed

11
at will.

It becomes a little more difficult whan you get

reciprocal legislation,
"This statute shall go into effect with respect
to any state which passes a similar statute,"
But I do not have any real trouble with that.
QUESTION:

But even that is revocable, is it not?

Each of the states under reciprocity is still free to with­
draw,
MR, GRISWOLD:

Each state is free to withdraw

though perhaps with the conditions of notice or things of
that kind and being bound as to actions that are taken while
it was in effect.
QUESTION:

I expect what I am really getting at —

do you suppose that in these several lists we have an ex­
haustive list of everything-that falls within the definition?
MR, GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice.

I think making an

exhaustive list is extraordinarily difficult.
QUESTION:

There must be many other types of

agreements.
MR. GRISWOLD:

These are simply the compacts which

were listed in that publication of the Council of States
Government.
form laws.

This Court has dealt, to some extent, with uni­
It has made passing references that they do not

come within the compact clause and in one or two cases, with
reciprocal legislation, particularly with respect to taxes on

12
interstate carriers but this Court has never upheld a multistate compact involving an administrative agency with dele­
gated powers from the states which has not received the con­
sent of Congress.
Now,, let me get back to what moved the court
below — incidentally, I may say that a great many of the
compacts which have been consented to by Congress involve
relatively small matters.

Eighteen of the first twenty-

eight involved two-state interstate boundary agreements and
I would call attention to the Ohio-Pennsylvania Amendment
listed on page 67 of the brief which affects motorboats in
Lake Pymatuning and increases the power which may be used
from six horsepower to ten horsepower.
The consent of Congress was sought to that agree­
ment and obtained.
I would emphasise

how diligently Congress has

reviewed the many compacts brought before it.

Congress has

often imposed conditions and restrictions including time
limitations before granting consent and Congress has refused
or failed to give consent in a number of instances, including
this one.
Well, how, then, was the Multistate Compact sus­
tained by the Court be lev;?
QUESTION:
Mr. Griswold?

May I ask one other question,

How many of these compacts has this Court

13

struck down or not —
MR. GRISWOLD:

This Court has never struck down

any compact for not having been consented to by Congress, nor
has it sustained any compact involving a multistate agreement
with an active administrative agency having extensive powers
delegated to it by the states.
QUESTION:

Well, is that because they just did not

come hers?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, Mr. Justice?

You say we did not sustain any.

Is

that because there were none presented?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No such cases have been presented.

Take, for example, the Southern Regional Educational Compact,
as things worked out, this Court's decisions in other cases
came along and the concern about it disappeared and there
was no occasion to attack it.
QUESTION:

Here, there —

Is not some of the financing of Mahari

Medical College ii Nashville financed through that compact?
MR. GRCSWOLD:

Yes, the first clause provided for

rnultistate financing of Mahari Medical School, the objective
being that that would then be a mediccil school for all the
state’s parties aid they could, send their students there and
not only be within the

Gainas case, but have a Congressional

enactment which could arguably be contended to be under
Section five of the 14th Amendment that that was a valid

14
result.
QUESTION:

And that medical school is still opera­

ting and it is still financed in that same xmy, is it not?
MR. GRISWOLD:

The financing of it, I suspect, is

very complicated, a great deal of it being charitable and a
very large amount of it being federal but I do not know the
financing of Mahari.
QUESTION:

But Mahari was long before then -— was

in existence long before then.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes.

Yes, it was.

The problem arises because of a dictum of this
Court in Virginia against Tennessee and it was clearly a dic­
tum, as is shown in our briefs.

The Court held that Congress

had given its consent long ago informally but effectively
and having held that, the Court then said, "It is evident
that the prohibition of Article I Section 10 is directed to
the formation of any compact attending to the increase of
political power in the states which may encroach upon or
interfere with the just supremacy of the United States."
Now, I 'would find out first, not only was that
dictum but it was a hard case.

It was a case where the boun­

dary line had been established and accepted for 90 years.
involved a one-tine, one-place bilaters.1 agreement and the
same is true in this Court's more recent decision in New
Hampshire acainst Maine a year ago on which the court below

It

15
also relied.
There the boundary was established in 1740 by an
order of the Privvy Council in England, more than 200 years
ago and the agreement before the Court was simply a stipula­
tion to settle a lawsuit involving a controversy as to the
exact location of the boundary over the water and I would
have thought that it would have been easier for the Court
simply to hold that since the Constitution gives the Court
jurisdiction over suits between two states, that a stipula­
tion between the parties settling that case approved by the
Court xtfas not a compact to which Article I Section 10 applied.
The essential fact* as I have said here,, is that
this Court has never upheld the validity of a modern compact
and I may say, the modern period in compacts really begins
about 1921 with the Colorado River Compact, the Port of New
York Authority.

Since then there have been a substantial

number of compacts involving multistate agreements with
administrative bodies and the Court has never given its
consent to a modern compact involving many states and crea­
ting an independent administrative commission to which Con­
gress has not given its consent.
Indeed, since almost all compacts have sought and
obtained the consent of Congress, few questions covering the
validity of compacts lacking Congressional consent have
reached this Court.

16
The cases which have come here have all involved
one time, one place bilateral boundary agreements and have
virtually no application to a wideranging multistate agreement such as that now before the Court.
QUESTION:

Each of those two in the latter cate­

gory you referred to, Hr» Griswold, the Tennessee, Virginia,
New Hampshire and Maine, were irrevocable compacts, were they
not?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, they were, Mr. Justice,

Again,

I think that really does not make any difference because as
long as they are joined together, the compact has an impact.
QUESTION:

Well, I am curious, though, as to what

consequences are visited upon your client by the existence of
this agreement that could not be equally well visited upon
them by similar legislation in the party states, separately
adopted,
MR, GRISWOLD:

I think, Mr, Justice, that I would

like to answer that, in part, by reading a sentence from the
Third Annual Report of the Multistate Tax Commission:
"The Multistate Tax Compact is, like all compacts,
making it possible for states to

accomplish cooperatively

that which they cannot do severally,”
This is really an instance — I hate to use it
because I am not suggesting that the states have been con­
spiring but under the law of conspiracy if three, four, five

17
people join together to do something ■— and it was recognized
200 years ago that that has — 300 years ago that that has
impact above and beyond what any one of the individual par­
ties might do,
QUESTION:

But they join together to audit your

corporation's tax returns,
MR. GRISWOLD:
crime.

I mean, that is no crime, is it?
I am not suggesting that it is a

I am suggesting that, when states join together, they

are doing something above and beyond what is done by each of
the individual states.
A great many of the compacts which have been sub­
mitted to by Congress, many of them approved, some of them
■with qualifications and conditions and time limits and some
disapproved have keen invloved advisory arrangements.
This

is an agreement with a clout.

This compact

provides that the Multistate Tax Commission has subpoena
powers and that these subpoenas may be enforced by the courts
of any state which is a member of the compact?
QUESTION:

it also *—

What if the states refuse to exercise

that particular provision?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, it would be violating the law.

The law of its legislature provides that it shall enforce
the subpoenas of the Multistate Compact.
QUESTION;

Could it be expelled from the compact

by the other signatories?

18

MR- GRISWOLD:
supreme court.

It would be reversed by a state

I do not suppose there would be a federal

question so it would be hard to bring it here but I find it
hard to — I think it might well

be regarded as a sport and

that is unfortunate and we’ll go on to the next case, but the
law is clear, that the courts of the states which are members
of the compact shall enforce subpoenas against a resident of
their state issued by the Multistate Tax Compact.
I am also reminded of an experience I had with
General Hershey.

I tried to get him to do something and he

said, "Why, I heve no power to do that.
recommend."

All I can do is

And of course, there was nothing that was more

emphatic than a recommendation from General Hershey and I
would like to call attention to a quotation from an article
which is cited on page 10 of our reply brief relating to the
Interstate Compact on Oil and Gas.

This is an article by

Leach cited at the bottom of page 10 with respect to that
compact which, incidentally, has been

approved by Congress

always with time: limitations, always with requirements for
a report to Congress; more recently with requirements that
there be reports to the Attorney General with respect to
antitrust implications and Leach says, legally it has no
power.
Actually, it is the most powerful and respected
agency in the oil and gas industry and so I say here that the

19
Multistate Tax Compact has an impact discussed at greater
length in our brief and that in the language of Justice
Frankfurter and James M. Landis who wrote the great article
in this field back in 1925, this is something where Congress
should exercise its judgment.
Now, they wrote in this article in the Yale Lav?
Journal, "Historically, the consent of Congress as a pre­
requisite to the validity of agreements by states appears as
the Republican transformation of the needed approval of the
Crown but the condition plainly had two very practical ob-r
jectives in view in conditioning agreement by states upon
consent of Congress for only Congress is the appropriate
organ for determining what arrangements between, states come
within the permissive class of agreement or compact.
"Even the permissive agreements may affect the
interests of states other than those parties to the agreement.

The national and not merely a regional interest may

be involved."
And hare there is a very clear national interest
involved as is evidenced by the pending treaty with the
United Kingdom, the avoidance of double taxation treatied
with the United Kingdom which contains a provision insisted
upon by the United Kingdom — and a number of other countries
are also concerned with it — of preventing the use of one
of the practices of the Multistate Tax Commission called

20

"combination."
It is a little like
is much broader than that.

consolidated returns only it

We have gone into it in some

detail in our brief.
The chairman of the Multistate Tax Commission has
appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in
opposition to that provision of the treaty.

The Task Force

on foreign Income of the Ways and Means Committee has reecommended that this provision be held inapplicable in foreign
taxation and a recommendation has been made to the President
that this be included in his current tax program.
Now, this seems to me to be the clearest possible
illustration of the fact that the activities of the Multi­
state Tax Commission do impinge upon the powers and authority
of the United States and that they ought not to be allowed to
be put into effect unless and until the compact has obtained
the consent of Congress.
QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, this case was decided on

summary judgment, I take it and is all or almost all of the
matters that you go through in your brief that you presented
here with respect to impact in the record?
all subject to judicial notice.

Or perhaps it is

I do not know but one of

the questions that you presented here was whether the case
should be decided an summary judgment but
■that in your brief at all.

you never developed

You simply prefer us to decide

21

whether you should have had summary judgment instead of the
other party.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Whether the case should have been

decided against us on summary judgment was a point which we
wish to preserve and so we raised it in our question con­
cerning —
QUESTION:

You certainly did not argue it very --

MR. GRISWOLD:

We did -- well, we wanted to avoid

having somebody say, "Well, you never raised that question."
That is one of the problems that counsel have.'5
We did raise, in the District Court, towards the
end, the question that in view of the compact clause, the
case, the summary judgment should go for the Plaintiffs and
our position here is that all of the material is now in the
record or is material of which the Court can take judicial
notice such as this reference to the treaty with Great
Britain, which is pending before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee now and the citation —
QUESTION:

Well, it certainly would require us to

deal with a lot of things the District Court has never dealt
with.
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, I do not think that there is

any requirement that the Court do that.

I think that there

is plenty of material in the record so that the Court can hold
tnat this Multistats Compact setting up an administrative

22
commission v?ith subpoena power, enforcement powers, power to
make regulations, is one which is covered by the compact
clause and cannot be put into effect without the consent of
Congress»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dexter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. DEXTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. DEXTER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
There are several issues and questions that have
been raised by Mr, Griswold's argument that I think need to
be clarified and clarified immediately and the first issue
is the one that is implicit in listing compacts or agreements
which have been approved by Congress and the reference to
the fact that the Multistate Tax Compact was submitted to
Congress.
First, :.t should be realized that two states, in
asking for admission to the compact and in enacting the compact, specifically made provisions in their admission legis­
lation for Congressional approval so Congressional approval
needed to be sought on that grounds,
Secondly, it certainly was a. matter of expediency
fco do so but the Attorney General's opinions, the opinions of
Counsel to the Commission clearly indicated that under the
Virginia versus Tennessee test, which has been the

controlling test for a number of years, no Congressional
consent was required.
QUESTION:

That was the Attorney General5 s

opinion.
MR. DEXTER:

The Attorney General of Washington

and the Attorney General’s opinion of Illinois.
two

Those were

opinions that were issued and there they indicated that

Congressional consent was not required.
They looked at the provisions of the compact in
light of the history and language of the tests to be employed
to determine its constitutionality of Virginia versus Tennes­
see and decided that this was not. the

kind of a compact or

agreement which needed Congressional consent so we simply say
that the fact that compacts are submitted to Congress for
Congressional consent are a matter of political expediency.
For instance, the Great Lakes Basin Compact which
the Appellants refer to in their brief which was submitted to
Congress finally for consent, the statement in the Congres­
sional Record regarding that consent simply says that, "In
view of the dispute concerning the necessity for the compact,
it seems clear that it would be more prudent to secura Con­
gressional consent rather than to forego consent and thereby
throw it out on the validity of the compact and on the commis­
sion ' s activities.
I submit that the taking and the throwing together

24
all the compacts that Congress has approved and than telling
this Court that that is the constitutional test, that is what
the compact means under the Constitution, is not appropriate.
We rather believe that the appropriate test to
m

determine the validity of a compact, including the compact
in question, is to look at the judicial history concerning
that compact clause.
In Virginia versus Tennessee it is true that the
language of Justice Fields was dicta.

It is also true that

he went at great length to explain and understand the purpose
and mean5:ng of the compact clause in the United States
Constitution and he, in that decision, laid down a test, a
standard by which that clause could be interpreted.
a test for all time.

It was

It was a test for all kinds of compacts

and then in that decision, he went ahead and applied that
test to determine the validity of the compact in question
and. this Court, in New Hampshire versus Maine followed
exactly the same procedure.
The first question is, what does the compact
clause mean?

Not

.n the context of a boundary dispute, but

in the context of uhe Constitution and this Court there
referred to the Virginia versus Tennessee test and simply
gave the compact clause that interpretation and then turned
around and applied it to the boundary agreement there invol­
ved and found no Congressional consent was required.

25

Since Virginia versus Tennessee, the state courts
have been uniformly for that test and that test simply is
whether or not a compact increases the political power of the
states in a manner which tends to impinge or encroach upon
just federal supremacy.
QUESTION:

You say the state courts have followed

that decision?
MR. DEXTER:

The state courts,, Your Honor, have

followed that decision and several of the decisions are put
forth in our brie::.

In fact, the earlier case than 1854,

jyAiWBranch Railroad Company, a Georgia case cited in our
brief, actually ended up with the same kind of standard.

It

simply said that the compact clause did not mean all agree­
ments, it. meant those political types of agreements which
would tend to interfere or encroach upon federal supremacy
and I think that fcJiat decision may well have influenced the
decision or Justice Fields in Virginia versus Tennessee.
QUESTION:

Wall, what about agreements that might

encroach upon the supremacy of the United States but which
might not tend, to increase the political power of the states?
Or do you think that any agreement which tends to
encroach would intend to increase the political power of the
states?

MR. DkrfoTLRj

i. would think that any encroachment

coaxes intend to increase the political power of the states-

QUESTION:

Sc, really, that is the .test?

MR. DEXTER:

Yes.

There are some cases where

this Court has upheld an increase of the power of the states,
for instance, reciprocal legislation such as that approved by
this Court in Port of New York versus 0’Neill,359 U.S. 1,
which I vrould like to call to the Court’s attention and I
have not put in my brief.
Eut in chat case, the Court recognised that by
reciprocal legislation which was in the nature of an agree­
ment, each court was really extending its enforcement powers
cooperatively by agreement in other states and under that
case, this Court upheld the extradition of the witness from
Florida to New York in a criminal proceeding as a result of
reciprocal lagis Xation.
QUESTION:

But if you show encroachment, you need

not go on and show separately, increase in political power.
MR, DEXTER:

No.

I think the fact of encroachment

is tantamount to Indicating that the states are trying to
interfere or encroach upon federal supremacy.
QUESTION:
where.

The power "would necessarily go some­

If it left the federal it would not just go in limbo,

would it?

It would be bound to flow in some fashion —
MR. DEXTER:

Yes.

Well, today it would have to

flow, Your Honor, to the states.
this is the

That, is right.

So we think

standard that this Court should apply in this

27
case.
QUESTION:

Let's put it another way.

Normally if

a state wants to find out about the tax basis of a corpora­
tion in another state, you have to go to the Federal Govern­
ment to do it.
MR. DEXTER:

Well, there is exchange of informa­

tion agreements between the states and between the states and
the Federal Government.

There is an exchange of audit in­

formation, and so forth.
QUESTION:

And you do not think that is involved

in this encroachment?
MR. DE [TER:

Mo, I think that if an agreement by

the states to exchange tax information is valid, that basi­
cally, the compact does very little more with the joint
audit program.
QUESTION:

Well, what is your answer to Mr. Gris­

wold's argument in light of what you just said about encroach­
ment in respect to the pending treaty in the —
MR. DEXTER:

Yes.

In the first place, as we

indicated in our brief, there is no provision of the Multi­
state Tax Compact chat has anything to do with combined re­
porting,

The only substantive income tax provision there is

contained in -Article III and IV.

Articles III grant the tax­

It permits a taxpayer with a minimal

presence and sales in a state to use a simplified form of

All multistate taxpayers, under Article III, have
a right to apportion or allocate their income as an option in
accordance with Article IV of the Compact.
Article IV contains the language of the Uniform
Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act.
to do with the division of income.

That language has

It has nothing to do with

combined reporting and there is no provision in the Compact.,
there is no rule <r: regulation the Commission has ever
issued.

There is no audit that has ever been conducted by

the Commission that touches upon the subject matter in the
United Kingdom Treaty.
I think we have explained that very definitely in
our brief.

It is simply a red herringApull in the U.K»

Treaty and indicato that this has something to do with the
Compact.
QUESTION:

Well, it is not your organization that

is planning to enter into a treaty with the United Kingdom,
i3 it?
MR. DEXTER:
QUESTION:

No.
It is the United States.
t

MR. DEXTER:

Right, and the Compact is not mentioned.

Article IX for the Compact would prevent the states
from including a foreign United Kingdom parent in a combined
return with a U.S. domestic subsidiary.

29

QUESTION:

But if that is inconsistent with some

provision of a federal treaty, I take it Missouri versus
Holland would invalidate it.
MR. DEXTER:

Oh, no question about that. Your

Honor, but the treaty has not been enacted and as we indi­
cated in our briec, if it doss, that practice

which is

state practice and has nothing to do with the Compact has
obviously to be changed.
But the United Kingdom Treaty has absolutely
nothing to do with the Compact or what has

been done with

references to its administration.
Nov;, I would like to indicate that this case was
here — is here

0:1

a motion for a summary judgment.

The

United States Dis :rict Court for the Southern District of
New York requires what they call a 9-G statement.

In that

statement, the party moving for a summary judgment has to
set forth what he believes to be the undisputed facts in the
cause.
We did chat and the Appellants came back, did
not deny anything that was set forth there and so those
statements in the 9G statement of the Appellees are uncontro­
verted .
It should further be indicated to this Court that
both the three-judge court below and the Supreme Court of
Washington in the Herts case found that what the Appellants

30
were arguing for is the constitutionality of the Compact on
its face.

They ask that the Compact be declared

void in

toto and that its Commission be disbanded.
We submit that this is a matter of law and all
that is required is to determine the constitutional test to
be applied under Virginia versus Tennessee, look at the pro­
visions of this Compact and see whether or not that test is
violated.
The nett issue that I would like —
QUESTION:

Was vour motion for summary judgment

ever opposed on the grounds that there were still factual
matters to be resolved?
MR. DEXTER:
of

Yes, the argued that there are a lot

factual matters but the lower court, in reference to

that argument, simply said this:

"Mo contention is made that

the Compact is be l ag administered other than according to its
terms.5'

I am reading from 3a of the Appendix — of Appendix

a of the Jurisdictional Statement.
"Mo contention is made that the Compact is being
administered other than according to its terms except that
the particulars governed by the substantive tax laws of the
respective party states.

The constitutional issues posed by

this complaint reduce themselves to questions of law.
"Certain of the issues of fact Plaintiffs would
seek to raise are purely hypothetical and speculative.

As to

31
these issues, Plaintiffs have not 'Set forth specific facts
showing there is a genuine issue for trial.!

Rule 50 6E

FR Civil Procedure.
"Certain other claimed issues of fact are plainly
not material to the determination of the merits of the con­
stitutional arguments raised here."
So, yes, there was an argument that we want more
and more discovery and they have drawers of discovery con­
cerning everything that anybody ever conceivably ever said
or did in reference to the Compact, including copies of every
audit that the Commission has ever made and et cetera.
So we do hot believe that there is here any ques­
tion but what this is a question of the constitutionality of
this Compact on its face.
Now, 1 would like to indicate that Article XII of
the Compact contains a severability clause.

Under that

clause, it is incumbent upon the Appellant to show what pro­
visions, if anyt of the Compact are unconstitutional and only
those provisions become inoperative under Article XII.
The remainder of the provisions remain in full
force and effect so you have to take the Virginia versus
Tennessee test of whatever test this Court wishes to apply in
interpreting the compact clause and look at it in reference
to each of the compact provisions.
I would suggest that the only real issue in this

cause is whether or not the tax administrators of the member
states can join together in a cooperative audit program and
to authorize the Commission of which they are members to act
as their auditing agent in order to enforce their own tax
laws .
Now, to understand that this is the only issue, it
is necessary to quickly refer to the substantive provisions
of the compact.
I have already commented on Article
Article IV.

III and

Those are optional provisions solely for the

benefit of the taxpayers.

They could in no wise burden

interstate commerce and they are no different than reciprocal
legislation such as upheld by the Court in Bode versus
Barrett and in New York versus tVNeill and need no further
comment,
Article V of the Compact grants certain options
to multistate taxpayers for sales and use tax purposes.
are for the furtherance of interstate commerce.

They

They are a

benefit to taxpayers; could not possibly deny the Appellants
any constitutional right and, we believe, raise no serious
questions.
The powers of the Commission or the authority,
this tremendous authority that the Appellants are referring
to in their brief are contained in Articles VII and VIII and
in paragraph three of Article VI of the Compact.

33
Paragraph three of Article VI of the Compact
gives the Commission only fchs authority to study, to recom­
mend and to issue proposals that would aid in the uniform
application and the relief of compliance problems in state
and local tax matters»
Now, this advisory and recommendatory function
of the Commission is no different than discharge by a myriad
of organizations b etween the states or the National Governors
Conference or the National Association of Attorneys General,
the National Association of Tax Administrators,
It is no different in function than that of the
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
They have the power to get together at the state agency to
recommend uniform laws that affect the national interest, I
suppose and affect the interstate commerce and —
QUESTION:
MR, DEXTER:

Do any of them have subpoena powers?
No.

Now, I would — the subpoena

power of the Commission is in Article VIII and I would address
that now although it is a little out of order of what I was
going to say.
The Article VIII does grant the Tax Commission,
as the auditing agent of a tax administrator to go to the
courts of the member states to enforce that subpoena.
Now, tills authority is no different than the
authority that each individual tax administrator has on his

34
own account.

This led the Supreme Court of Washington in

the Hertz case and the three-judge court below to conclude
that there was no shift of power among the states by this
subpoena power and that thers was no encroachment on federal
supremacy.
All that the Commission is doing is standing in
the stead of the tax administrator of each state as his
agent.
Now, it is true that Article VIII of the Compact
permits the Commission to go into any member state that has
adopted Article VIII and enforce that subpoena but it is sub­
mitted that this extension or increase of state power is
specifically upheld by this Court in New York versus the
O'Neill case, that uhe courts can make arrangements among
themselves and agree to make their courts available to en­
force the laws of another state and there is a whole series
of reciprocal legislation or agreements in the nature of
reciprocal legislation that the states utilise for'- this
purpose.
So we think —■ and it should also be realised that
that provision of the Compact is severable and it is not
necessary tor the

joint audi ; program.

Many of the "subpoenas

and court proceedings that the Appellants have referred to
in their brief

as abuses by the Commission ware really sub­

poenas by the individual stale courts asking their courts to

35
enforce that subpoena that requested that the multistat©
taxpayers turn their books and records over to the Commission
as an agent for all its purposes.
It was state subpoenas that were used that were
complained of in "ie Appellant’s brief and this is why we
asserted there that such allegations did not involve any
authority or power of the Commission.
But we believe even though the subpoena power is
severable, not necessary to the validity or working of the
joint audit program, that it suffers no constitutional defect.
Now, I would like to move on to the other substan­
tive provision in ihe Compact, Article VII and it permits the
tax administrators of the member states to participate in a
joint audit even though it permits the tax administrators of
the member states ;o issue advisory regulations and forms
where state laws are uniform or similar.
Now, th is is pureLy an advisory function.

The

only regulations fiat the Commission has promulgated at all
concern Article IV of the Compact, which is the optional
provision.

It contains the language of the Uniform Division

of Income for Tax ’urposes Act promulgated by the National
Conference of Commissioners

on Uniform Stata Laws.

Now, this ability to issue advisory regulations
that are optional with the states is no

different than the

ability of any person or entity whatsoever.

It is done by

36

the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Stats
Laws.

It has been done for years by the National Association

of Tax Administrators,

It could be done by the American Bar

Association, any other group or individual whatsoever.
are purely advisory.

They

They have no force or effect until they

are adopted by the state and surprisingly, the only regula­
tion that Appellants are complaining about here has to do
with an optional provision under the Compact,
Therefore, before the regulations under Article
IV adopted by the Commission can be applicable to a balance,
two things must happen.
One, they have to elect to apportion or allocate
their income under Article IV and secondly, a state has to
adopt those regulations as their own regulation.

When they

do, it becomes fchair regulations and not the advisory regu­
lations of the Commission.
QUESTION:

In that respect, I suppose you are

arguing that this puts it in the same category as the Commis­
sion on Uniform State Laws.
MR. DEXTER:
QUESTION:
MR. DEXTER:

Right,
Each member can take it or leave it.
This is precisely true, Your Honor.

It has no more binding effect than any recommendation of the
Commissioners.

Bac that so-called power in the Commission

is one of these great powers that the Appellants attribute

37

to the Commission and under their argument, contains a lot
of abuses, interferes with international affairs, it inter™
feres with the national interests, it interferes with the
interests of the nonmentber states and interferes with com™
merce.
Now, this is — it just cannot be that way.

There

is nothing of that kind of power involved.
QUESTION:

If it is all so simple, you ought to

be able to get it approved by Congress, could you not?
HR* DEXTER:

We have not sought to get it approved

by Congress for a number of years and the reason we do not
get -™ rnay not have; it approved by Congress leads me to
Article VIII and this may explain why we have problems with
Congress and why Appellants are bringing this lawsuit.
Article VIII of the Compact, in addition to the
subpoena power that, we have just discussed does give the
Commission the power to audit the books and records as agent
of a multistats taxpayer.
This power or authority is not exercised except
when a specific state authorises the Commission, as its agent,
to audit the books and records.
The Commission's auditors have no power or fix or
determine any tax liability, no authority to fix any policy
of any member state in regard to any issue.
as auditing agents of that member stats

They act purely

What the Appellants

38

are x*eally saying to this Court -QUESTION:
MR. DEXTER:

With the power of subpoena?
With the power to subpoena, Your

Honor, but only as agents of the tax administrator in carry­
ing that out.
As I said, a comparable power exists even as to
the

Commission's audits by the administrator himself issuing

the subpoena in his name, asking the taxpayer to turn its
books and records over to the Commission as that tax commis­
sioner's auditing agent so they are just parallel powers and
there is no shift of power to states that would in any way
encroach upon federal supremacy as a result of that provision
but what Appellants, are saying is that each state that wants
to audit the book.? and records, for example, of U.S. Steel
must have their auditors lined up at the corporate headquar­
ters of U.S. Steel and vrait their turn to conduct an audit.
And when they finally get through the corporate
door, they are entitled to pick up information only for that
one state.
The basic issue here is whether or not the tax
administrators of zhe members states responsible for adminis­
tration of state laws can work together in a cooperative
audit program.
The Appellants want no part of that and the only
reason that we can think that they do not want any part of it

39

is because this extends the capability of the states to en­
force their tax lavs and I submit to Your Honors that that
kind of capability is in the national interest»

It is in the

/

interest of the states and it is in the interest of all the
taxpayers»
QUESTIO;:'!;

New, you said you would tell us why

this problem made you difficulties with the Congress?
MR. DEXTER;

Because Appellants and Cause and a

lot of the multistate taxpayers are opposing it in Congress
and want other federal legislation.

The Compact arose out

of the possibility of restrictive legislation that the
Appellants and others were pushing in Congress and this is
why the Compact contains beneficial provisions for multi­
state taxpayers in trying to solve some of the problems.
What we are trying to get is uniformity and compa­
tibility in a state tax system and to help the states enforce
their tax laws and they want no part of that.
I would like to indicate the admissions of the
Appellants in regard to the effect of the Compact.

They say,

on page 12 of their brief, "The potential impact of such a
compact is not readily determinable."
We suggest that it does not have any potential
impact on federal supremacy and that is the reason it is not
determinable.
So all we are suggesting to this Court is, examine

40
the case law concerning the compact clause, look at the
specific provisions of the compact clause in the light of the
Appellant's argument and we are confident you will come out
with the same conclusion that the three-judge court did in
its well-reasoned opinion.
We do not believe it adequate for the Appellant
simply to throw judicial history out of the window, call it
dicta, limit it to boundary disputes and hopefully, in that
way, have this Court come up with some different and new
standards.

«
The Constitution means the same thing, regardless

of the subject matter involved, whether it involves boundary
disputes, reciprocal legislation and so forth.
Now, we believe the reasoning of Justice Felix
Frankfurter in the case of New York versus O'Neill is in­
structive and helpful in resolving this question.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dexter, is there anything in the

record — I take it there is not — as to why these states
withdrew?
MR. DEXTER:

These states withdrew, Your Honor,

as a practical macter, because the Committee on State Taxes
of the Council of State Governments composed of 106 of the
largest corporations in the United States have as one of
their objectives to destroy the cooperative effort repre­
sented by these provisions I have referred to you today and

41
that is why those states have withdrawn»

Is that in the record?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

would like to deal with the — with Mr. Justice Blackmun's

42

question first.

It is an instance of how this Commission

pays no attention to the Compact.

The Compact provides es­

pecially that each state shall have one vote.
California came in on condition that nothing
should be passed unless there was a vote of a majority of the
population of the states.
Not quite.

That gave California almost a veto.

But California and two or three other states can

veto and the legislative history is clear that that is the
reason why Indiana withdrew.
The annual reports of the Commission make it plain
that the genesis of the Compact was to head off federal legis­
lation with respect to taxation of interstate businesses.
In other words, in its very origin, it had ™ its
purpose was to interfere with the exercise of federal power.
Reference has been made to UDITPA, the Uniform
Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act.

UDITPA provides for

allocation of nonbusiness income but the Commission, by its
regulations, provides that virtually all nonbusiness income
shall be apportioned.
Here again, as several commentators cited in our
brief have shewn, the Commission pays simply no attention to
the law.

You can say, "Well, they only have recommendatory

power" but it recommends to the states that they proceed this
way and they do proceed that, way, as is evidenced by an itera
i:a the record where the Commission recommended to a number of

43
states that they make arbitrary assessments against corpora­
tions which did not comply with the actions of the state
commissioners and that this would be a means of bringing
about their capitulation.
I would like to refer particularly to an opinion
by Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach.
our brief we have mistakenly said#

In a letter by him in

"The Attorney General.”

He was later Attorney General but when he wrote
the letter, he was Deputy Attorney General, dealing with
the Great Lakes Compact in which he pointed out that merely
because it was advisory did not mean that it could not

have

impact on the powers of the Federal Government.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think that consumes

your additional time, Mr. Griswold.
MR. GRISWOLD:

We have limped along too long on

Virginia against Tennessee.

It is time for the Court to

bring the compact clause into the modern age.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:50 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
