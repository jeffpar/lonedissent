MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next on No. 76-1172, First National Bank of Boston, i!t Al,
versus Francis X. Bellotti, Et Al.
Mr. Fox, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS H. FOX, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. FOX:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This is an appeal from the Supreme Judicial Court
of Massachusetts, a declaratory judgment action in which the
Plaintiffs contest the validity of Chapter 55, Section 8 of
the General Laws which forbids corporations fron expending
or contributing monies in an attempt to influence the vote
on any question — referendum question other then a question
which materially affects the assets of the corporation.
It is specifically provided that no question which
relates solely to individual taxes shall be deemed materially
to affect the corporate assets.
In November, 1976 there was on the ballot a ques­
tion which related solely to individual taxes, whether the
Constitution should be amended to provide for graduated
income taxes.
Plaintiffs wish to expend or contribute monies
to oppose that referendum question by means of media ads and

4
the like»
They did not do so because of the severe criminal
penalties attendant upon violation and the threat of prosecu­
tion.
Plaintiffs are five business corporations located
in the state with deep and pervasive ties to the economy,
I

For example,, the plaintiffs banks have on. loan to business
corporations literally billions of dollars.

Plaintiffs

among them employ between 20,000 and 25,000 people ir. the
state.
The management of each of the plaintiff corpora­
tions believed that the interests of the corporetion would
be materially affected by the referendum question in various
ways the record spells out.
For example, the plaintiff banks believed that if
the graduated tax were viewed as one more anti-1 usiness lav;
in the state, it might detract from other businesses locating
in the state or staying in the state and thus diminish the
business of the banks..
Two of the- plaintiffs, for example, employ highlyskilled and thus highly-paid engineers.

They must thus com-

pe'-:e with other states to attract these engineers to the
state.

They felt that a graduated income tax might make it

more difficult to attract these kinds of people.
In any event, the management of each of the-

plaintiffs did believe, the record finds,, that the graduated
tax would affect the business of the corporations.
The Supreme Judicial Court, held, however, that
since there was no finding that in fact the graduated tax
would affect the interests of the plaintiffs.

The/ vers

without First Amendment protection for their prospective
speech here.
The Supreme Judicial Court upheld the statute.
Today vie appeal arguing First Amendment

Plaintiffs appeal.

Due Process in that the statute makes use of a presumption
yet is a criminal statute.

Also the underlying standard if.-’

self is unconstitutionally vague, materially affecting the
Assets and Equal Protection in that a single ballot question
is singled out for an absoluta prohibition as tc expenditures
or contributions whereas any other kind cf a ba3lot question
has a different standard applied, one of materially affecting
the assets.
Also on Equal Protection, the fact that business
corporations are the only entities that are regulated by
Section 8 from top to bottom, Section 8 regulates only busi­
ness corporations, not partnerships, charitable corporatiors
or other entities similarly situated.
Today I will address the mootness question.

tics they are no longer charity.

Is that not what the Massa­

chusetts law says?
MR. FOX:

Well, the Massachusetts lavr does, not

restrict charitable corporations in any kind of a haJ.lot
question at all, Your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. FOX:

They can lobby?
They can.

On page 46 of the jurisdic­

tional statement Appendix there is listed a number of organ­
izations which have advocated a graduated income tax in the
past.

These are the Americans for Democratic Action, Council

of Churches, this kind of a listing and whether they would
run into tax problems; or not, I do not know.
QUESTION:

Eut —

That is the question I was asking.

Does not the state law prohibit this?

No, it does not.

No, I do not believe that they all arc

I think some of them may be.

Seme of them

My purpose in listing them or referring to them

is just on the mootness question, Your Honor, tc indicate
that it is likely to come back again.

•7

I can say this, charitable corporations are not
forbidden from contributing or expending as to referendum
questions in Massachusetts.

Whether tax considerations

would indicate they not do it, I do not know.
I will address mootness, First Amendment end Equal
Protection arguments this morning or this afternoon and rely
on my brief for the other points.
QUESTION:

In that discussion, would you be good

enough to, if you know, tell us the status of the proposed
amendments to the statute that we are dealing with?
MR. FOX:

Yes, it is in the nature of a bill that,

is still pending in the legislature.
bills that ware introduced.

It combined 13 separate

An advisory opinion was requested.

The Supreme Judicial Court declined to answer the questions QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

They have the power there,
They have the power to but they declined

to for the very reason that this case is pending and the bi11
is wending its way through the legislative process,

I have

X

no idea whether it will pass or not.
I know it has not as yet passed.
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

And what does it provide?
The bill would amend Chapter 1>5, Section

8 in other material respects to — it would not touch the
graduated income tax prohibition or the materially-affecting
standard but it would put a $1,000 limit on the mount that

8
corporations could contribute to any question if they are
materially affected.
It would require that committees not tale tore
than $1,000.

It would forbid outside--of-the-state corporation

from making any contributions.
QUESTION:

So it would not eliminate these res­

trictions and would add others.
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
But does it not make it, the require­

ment of materiality, a little easier to fulfill for pending
legislation, this

two-thirds vote of the stockholders?

MR. FOX:
requirement.

No, I look at that as an additional

If it is material, you must get two-thirds vote

and you must, meat the material-affecting standard as well.
And you can. only spend $1,000.
And with a. public corporation, Your honor, that
might mean that to get two-thirds vote, they micht have to
spend $5,000 or $6,000 to get the privilege to expend $1,000
if it is materially-affecting.

3ut those amendments are not

before the Court except by way of, perhaps, relevance on the
mootness question.

I think they are not really relevant

on that, either.
The election is over but the case is not. moot
because it comes within the capable of repetition yet. evading
review principle which, as enunciated for nor—c3 as „■ actions

:3

in Weinstein versus Bradford requires that there be t. reason­
able expectation that the same offending order will e.ffect
the seme plaintiffs in the future and that the time within
which to seek full review will ba too limited to allow it.
In an analysis with raspect to the facts in this
case, it would require a reasonable expectation that there
will be a grad tax on the ballot in the future, that the pro­
hibitory legislation will remain intact, that that prohibi­
tion will affect these plaintiffs in the future and that the
timing will preclude review .
Looking at the first question, will there be a
graduated tax on the ballot in the future?

J. would point out

that four times in the last 14 years the legislature has put
this question on the ballot for the people»

Each time they

have done so. by overwhelming votos — votes in the order of
200

to 40, this kind of thing.
The statistics appear at footnote 5 of our brief.
The Legislature obviously feels certe in financial

pressures — this and every other state legislature.

There

seems to be no abatement in those financial pressures»
Thirty-six out of the 50 states do have graduated
taxes.

There are public interest groups that advocate and

have advocated the graduated income tax as beinc necessary.
While it is not mathematically certain what will
happen in the future, I think there is a reasonable

10
expectation that with nothing to lose, the Legislahare will
once again put this question on the ballot to enable itself
to get a more efficient taxing vehicle.
Will the prohibitory statute remain intact?
The efforts of the legislature to put this question
before the people have been matched in that .14-year span by
efforts to cirrive at the right statutory formula that will
completely preclude corporate spending in the campaign.
Earlier versions of the prohibition led. to narrow­
ing court constructions which allowed corporations to contri­
bute.

Having now arrived at a complete and utter ban as to

any corporate contributions or expenditures, it is unlikely
in the extreme that the legislature will soften or elimina
that ban.
As I have indicated, they may indeed expand the
concept to make it more difficult as to other questions but
the likelihood that they will change this absolute prohibi­
tion is remote.
Will these plaintiffs be affected in the future?
Well, the record of their opposition is a strong
one,,

They contributed to oppose the grad tax ir

1371.

Three

of them brought the case that gave corporations the right to
do so.

They brought this case in 1976.

They appealed the

decision even after 'die election was over in order to able to
oe able to win the right to contribute or expend in the

11
future.
They remain unalterably opposed to a graduated
income tax and will oppose it whenever and wherever it comes
up,
QUESTION:

And there is a good possibility that

First National will still be in business for a few years.
MR. FOX:

I certainly hope so. Your Fanor.

They

owe me some money.
The opposition of the plaintiffs will not cease,
I think.
As far as the timing is concerned, I will rely
primarily on my brief.

We point out — and in the resply

brief we point out some of the scheduling am so forth that
would be encountered by any kind of a test case.
This time it took the maximum time that we could
have had to test.

It was 18 months.

There is no likelihood that there wi31 be more

It is vital that these procedures be straigh­

tened out before the election.

It is a First Jmendment cose.

There is a statute on the books that prohibits speech and as
Nebraska Press versus Stuart and other cases indicate, it is
also very important that these matters be straightened out.
Going on to the First Amendment question of the
argument here, there are numerous First Amendment issues.

I

would say numerous First Amendment errors, here.
QUESTION:

The very first issue, is it not,

Mr. Fox, is whether a corporation as such is protected by
the First Amendment.

I mean, we all know that the New York

Times Company and that, a producer

of a movie or those cor­

porations are and there are many cases so holding.
But are there any cases holding explicitly that
corporations like the Riggs Bank or General Motors or your
client, the First National Bank —
MR. FOX:
QUESTION;

No, that is where —
— the First National Bank Corporation

has a First Amendment right, at least to the same vigor as an

13
individual human being does?
MR. FOX:

Well, not as to ■—

QUESTION:
not have opinions.

It is one thing that a corporation can­
It is inanimate.

MR. FOX:

Its agents can

but —

I had rather say that whatever positions

or opinions the corporation may have must really be those of
some individuals who are acting in their representational
capacity.
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

Of its management.
Yes.

I would say that the Li• img.rk

Associates case, Your Honor, which did involve £ corporate
plaintiff and entailed a First Amendment boldine, is evi­
dence in that regard.

The Virginia Pharmacy case ' think

could not possibly be applied to eliminate corpcrations from
the ability to advertise drug prices.
I was about to suggest that while the Court below
said that is the first question we must decide, I think that
that is not so.

The Court below construed Section 3 as

creating two separate crimes.

One is the crime of contribu­

ting or expending to influence the vote on the referendum
question other than when it materially affects the assets
of the corporation and the other is the crime of contribu­
ting or expending with respect to a referendum question per-’
fcaining solely to individual taxes without regard to whether
that affects the corporate assets or not and the court is

14
very specific in that: regard.

Under this so-called "second

crime" what must be shown bv the prosecution to convict is
that a contribution is made in an attempt to influence the
vote on a matter pertaining solely to individual taxes, peri­
od.

It is no part of the prosecution’s task to show non­

materiality to corporate purpose.
The Court below construed the First /amendment
constitution -- not a statutory construction here but consti­
tutional law as allowing a

corporation, to have First Amend­

ment rights if it proved the affirmative of a very complicated
economic principle, namely, that although the referendum
question relates solely to individual taxes, it does, in
fact, materially affect the corporation.
The Court held that if the corporationswished to
>

prove that, then it would be afforded First Amendment pro­
tection for its speech.
We say that the analysis is inappropriate.
that the analysis should be as follows:

We say

money is speech.

Speech is protected unless and until it comes up against a
compelling state purpose in carefully-drafted legi, lation
which serves the purpose in the least-restrictive manner
available.
In other words, the prohibition should be made to
justify itself.

The focus should be on the prohibition.

corporate speaker should not be made to justify air.

The

15
prospective speech.
If one shifts the focus from the corporation — and
the Court below went into an artificial, I think, analysis of
the rights of corporations, their nature and what are; cons:, stent with their existence and so forth -- if one takes the
focus from that and

scrutinizes the prohibition here, one

will find that there is no compelling interest served by this
prohibition and if there is any purpose served, it is not
done in the least-restrictive way.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pox, would it

be constitutional

for a state to provide that no corporation may publish a
newspaper unless its articles of incorporation expressly
grant it that power?
MR. FOX;

I think not, 1’ our He nor.

3 think if

the state allows the creation and existence of t n. entity
capable of communication, it cannot squelch that communica­
tion without running into serious problems under tie First
Amendment„
Ultra vires is a possible concern of the state
but it is not served by this statute here which prohibits
only expenditures as to one kind of a political question, the
question relating to individual taxes.
Every other kind of a question, the relation to
the corporate purpose has a different standard applied to it.
But here you cannot contribute or expend, whether it is in

16

your articles of organization, whether it is absolutely
necessary for your purpose at all, if it relates to indivi­
dual taxes.
QUESTION:

Well, I tmdersfcand that about that

statute but your submission is that a state may not limit a
corporation to business other than newspaper publishing.

Any

corporation, once incorporated, has a right to publish a
newspaper.
MR. POX:

I would say so, yes, Your I oner.

I

would say the state could go to that corporatior — • or a
stockholder could go to the corporation
QUESTION:

Even if they do not publish a newspaper,

they publish annual reports and would you not think they
would have First Amendment rights in their annual reports to
their stockholders?
MR. FOXs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you think the corporation could be

required to get the consent of two-thirds of its stockholders
before it engages in a publishing activity?
MR. Fox."

Do you mean a statute saying that any

corporation wishing to communicate or publish should first
get the vote of two—thirds?
QUESTION:

Yes.

First take that as a. separate

requirement and then take it as a requirement that a corpora­
tion, before it does anything, has to get the vote of

17
two-thirds of its stockholders.
MR. FOX:

I would have less difficulty with the

statute that says a corporation, before it does anything,
must get two-thirds approval.
When the state comes in and says,"If you are going
to do some communicating, some publishing, you must get twothirds approval," I think there must be a compelli g purpose
found behind that and whatever it is, you must examine it to
see if there is not a less-restrictive way of serving that
purpose.
QUESTION:

Would you have any difficulty at all

with a requirement that a corporation, before it engage in
any corporate act, obtain the consent of two-third
shareholders'?

cf its

Any constitutional difficulty?

MR. FOX:

I would have difficulty with

:<

t in that

it seems to me that the primary emphasis on the Fi: st Amend­
ment is in the right of the hearer to listen, the right of
the public to hear and if you are going to restrict that, it
should only be to serve a very compelling purpose and this
would restrict it in some way because getting two-thirds
vote may be. a very difficult procedure.
QUESTION:

Well, surely you would have no question

about a statute that said in Massachusetts, there will be no
corporations.
MR. FOX:

No, I would not have any problem with

18

that.

If they said, publishers may not incorporate, I would

have problems with it.
QUESTION:

Well, do you have eny --- T. take: it that

you disagree that a corporation may be prevented from com­
municating about a political issue that does not affect its
interests,

QUESTION:

Oh, so you do say that it is contrary

to the First Amendment to limit the communications in that
manner?
MR. FOX:

Well, for the criminal lav/ to prohibit

a communication, I think ~~ I think it is possible for the
criminal law to do so.

I am just saying there must be one

whale of a public purpose served before this Court would allow
that to occur.

Now, what —

QUESTION:

In this case you. say that it was un­

constitutional for Massachusetts to say that yov have to have ~
the interests of the corporation have to be involved before
you may communicata about an election issue.
MR. FOX:

Well, of course, we are attacking the

second sentence primarily which says you cannot, contribute or

19

expend as to a referendum question relating to taxes, period.
QUESTION;

What if we were to accept the legisla­

tive declaration that individual income taxes do not affect
your interests at all?
MR. FOX:

Well,. I think that that is — if the

purpose is ultra vires, or to protect the: corporate share­
holder , it is an irrational device to serve that because it
is not logical to assume that the only way in which corporate
management could commit waste or commit acts of ul :ra vires
is with respect to a referendum question pertaining to taxes.
QUESTION:

Well, I know that is your opinion, bit

what if we assumed — what if we agreed with the. legislative
declaration that individual income taxes do not involve the
corporate interests and therefore the corporation may not
communicate?
MR. FOX:

Well, I think, if Your Honor please,

we would have to identify the purpose served.

If it is an

ulura vires purpose, the purpose of protecting the share­
holders, that it is assigned that a communi catior on indivi­
dual taxes is corporate waste, I guess I would say that that
thao would violate equal protection under the Moslay principle
where the State of Illinois cannot presume that non-labor
picketing is more vioxent than labor picketing and so forth.
QUESTION:

Do you think your position would have

any bearing on the constitutionality of the Federal Practices

20

Act which forbids corporations from contributing in federal
elections?
MR, FOX:
attack that.

No.

No, it is no part of my purpose to

As a personal opinion, I think perhaps it

would be difficult.
QUESTION:

You do not think the principle that

you are furthering here would undermine the federal statute?
MR. FOX;

No.

Here's why.

The purpose served by

the federal statute is to avoid the fact or appearance of
corruption.

A candidate repaying his heavy contributors out

of the public trust after he is elected is, as this Court
held in Buckley and Valeo, a very high purpose.

There is no

equivalent purpose in a candidate or a campaign relating to
referendum questions.
The prospect of corruption is non-existent.
one gets elected.

No

There are no political debts created.

Every court that has construed this kind of question since
Buckley — and there are four of them and they a re on page
one of our brief — has so held, Your Honor.

Sc that I

would say that the Federal Court Practices Act serves a conpel ling purpose.
Whether it is necessary to restrict corporations
to an absolute, prohibition is a different question, even
whetaer that federal statute xs serving a compelling purpose.
QUESTIONs

I have a little problem, !■>. Fee;:, vciti

21
this corruption point and the rights of individuals.

You

have a campaign to get a graduated individual income tax and.
candidate Jones for governor* a candidate for governor* is u
great exponent of that.
MR. FOX:

Would you. not be helping him?

I think there could be circumstances

where the particular
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

That would be inevitable* would it not?
But you see* the portions of the sta­

tute dealing with candidates — and this is a highly-regulated
area* at least in Massachusetts* could get indirect methods
as well as direct but in this record there is absolutely no
connection with a candidate or any partisan political issue
as car as compelling purposes.

Corruption cannot be won be­

cause there is not any likelihood of corruption,

/.voiding

undue influence of wealth is a purpose laid to v ealtl. by
this Court in Buckley versus Valeo where the Court said that
the concept that one element of society may have its speech
restricted in order to enhance the relative voice of another
element of society is contrary — alien to the First Amend­
ment .

position has been recognized by Co^rt’ viac in this Court to
*3® ct secondary purpose at best as far as corporate share—

nolc.i-.s3: s are concerned as distinguished from labor unions

^

22

where you might have compulsory union membership.

You might

have compulsory dues and union membership may be a precon­
dition to employment.
Here labor unions are not regulated in. the- least
hut as far as a corporate shareholder is concerned., this
purpose is definitely secondary and it is ill-served by a
statute which expresses that concern only as to one and one
only of the infinite number of referendum questions

.hat may

come up.
If I could go on to the Equal Protection portion
of it — before I do go on to that, if this Court is satis­
fied that the second sentence of the statute which prohibits
expenditures as to a particular question is unconstitutional,
1 do not think the Court need draw a line arounc what is
ultimately going to be First Amendment corporation free
speech.
If the Court would look at the facts set forth
between pages 15 and 27 of our Appendix here and rule that
on these facts a corporation may not constitutionally be
squelched from whatever communication it wishes to make
regardless- of the statute,
QUESTION:

That is — you are beginning with the

second step, are you not?

Really, as my brother Rchnquist

suggested in his question and you agreed with him in your
answer, Massachusetts or any other state can say to

23

individuals,, "In this state, you cannot carry on business
at all in corporate form."
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

I think they could, Your Honor, yes.
And the corporation laws generally of

each state set out the conditions under which individuals
can associate together in order to carry out their joint
endeavors in corporate form.
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And maybe they can say to individuals,

all of whom, of course individually are protected and have the
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment,"You can in corpor­
ate form
these."

only carry out your individual rights subject to
Those are the other conditions and is that rot sort

of like a time, place or manner restriction'on tow ard where
an individual can exercise; his First Amendment lights.
MR. FOX:

Well, the state cannot attech unconsti­

tutional conditions to the grant of any privilege and if the
state wished to serve: the purpose of keeping corporations
close to the track of their own business, perhaps a purpose •—
QUESTION:

Couldn't a state say, "In the state you

can only incorporate for purposes of carrying on a grocery
business and for no other"?
MR. FOX;
protection problems.

Well, I think there would be equal
If the incorporated form is : valuable

form and it is very meritorious to restrict it to one kind

of business or one element of society, 3t probably would be
an equal protection violation and maybe a Ifirst Am. ncment.
What I say is, the state could come in and say,
"Mr. Corporation, you should not be running newspapers.

You

should be selling shoes" and maybe get them in trouble as
far as the selling shoes is concerned but they could not shut
down the presses.

Once you are going to communicate, the

First Amendment is going to protect that communication.
If the shareholders want to bring a proceedings
civilly to assure that this something is changed, maybe so.
Criminal law should not go in.
QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that the share­

holders could not impose an advance obligation that you are
not to go into certain activities or you are not to go beyond
specific activities described in the charter without getting
a. two-thirds vote?
MR. FOX:

I think the shareholders ccul.-

do that.

Your Honor.

Xf the shareholders were to say, "Re are going

to hold —"

if the shareholders were to hold the corporation

to its purpose, it would seem to me that if the purpose gets
off into communication, then there must be constitutionally
a discretionary factor in management as to whether it is
reasonably related to that purpose that the shareholders
have set forth in the articles of organization.
Otherwise, you. would have management avoiding

25
communications and there would be a chilling effect»
The two-thirds approval, if it applies across the
board to all corporate activities, I would have no particular
problem with it.

Applying it to communication activities

only, X would have problems.

Applying it to one question, of

a number of political questions, I would have even greater
problems,
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fox, supposing that Messnchusetts

had these two statutes on the books; one, a prohibition, a
criminal prohibition against a director who violated a reso­
lution passed by a majority of the stockholders at the last
meeting and spent corporate funds in violation of that reso­
lution and then supposing that one of the corporations in
this suit, at its last stockholders meeting, passed a resolu­
tion saying, "We are sick and tired of having the First
National Bank of Boston spend money opposing this income tax
and we adopt a resolution saying that no more money like that
shall be spent."
Not/, could the president of the bank be prosecuted
criminally under that statute?
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

Mo, Your Honor.
Why not?
As I understood your hypothesis, the

source was a resolution of the corporation, not a criminal

QUESTION:

Welle the criminal statute says; that

any officer of a corporation who spends money contrary to a
valid resolution of the stockholders may be criminally prose­
cuted .

ture took place -QUESTION:

Amendment addressing that.
QUESTION:

In other words, you think that if a

president of a bank is simply on his own, so to speak, with
respect to the stockholders, if he figures he wants to com­
municate something, 99 percent of the stockholders cun toll
him no and he has still got a First Amendment right to do it?
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

Well —
And Massachusetts cannot punish him

criminally for doing otherwise.
MR. FOX:

QUESTION:

Then the State of Massachusetts cannot

adjust that baliince between shareholders and directors and
managers?
MR. FOX:

I think the State of Massachusetts

could but my point would be this:

If they are coirg to back

whatever the shareholder's right might be with the criminal
process,, I think they would have to have an element cf dis­
cretion vested in management, to make the judgment, call as to
whether the particular expenditure is related tc the business
purpose or not because otherwise you would have corporate
managers fearful of

making any communicative act whatsoever

last they go to jail.
Now, this case here does not involve any share­
holder rights.

The Massachusetts court in Lustwark indicated

that ultra vires is available in this kind of a situation.
That is a 1962 case.

But it held — I think the holding is

that the decision on corporate management’s part must be a
reasonable one and if it is, you cannot nudge it.
If the state wanted to come in and beef that up

28

with criminal penalties, I think the only way they could do
it would be to give a wide area within which management could
make a decision that somebody Plight second-guess later but
the First Amendment would not allow a jury to second-guess
management's decision and put him in jail if it is arguably
close to the corporate purpose.
QUESTION:

What you are saying, in affect, is that

the State of Massachusetts could not by statute place this
hypothetical law as a condition for using the corporate form,
for a bank in this case.

Even though they could abolish the use

of corporations totally.
MR. FOX:

I would think so,

First Amendment.

I would have no doubt on that.

Mr. Klley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. KILEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. KILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Appellants assert an absolute constitutional
right to expend money to influence the outcome on a ballot

29-30
question which was presented to the voters in 1976 and which
would have authorized the imposition of a graduated personal
income tax in the State of Massachusetts.
I might add that their desires relate to a ques­
tion that they would have no power to influence directly by
voting.
We state that there is no such right and. that only
the taxpayers of the Commonwealth and their duly-elected
representatives ought to be able to decide how they are
taxed.
Despite the arguments that Mr. Fox has just ear­
nestly advanced,, we think there are real differences between
corporations and individxxals, between elections of officials
and elections on referendum issues and the expression of
voter sentiment contained in referendum votes ard between the
graduated income tax amendment which appeared or the 1976
ballot and other kinds of questions.
I think that before wa reach those specific
differences — and I. address myself to those -— I would like
to reiterate a little bit about the way the Massachusetts
statutory framework works.
In Massachusetts we have approximately 70 years of
experience with a ban on corporate political con tr;; but ions
and roughly an equivalent amount of experience with questions
appearing on the ballot.

31
Throughout the history of the Massachusetts
statute, the prohibition against corporate contributions has
been applied to questions presented to the voter under the
initiative in referendum
our state constitution.

amendment and under Article 48 of
That includes constitutional amend­

ments like the grad tax.
Under the Massachusetts statutory framework, the
popular initiative and referendum reserved to tie people,
that is, to the voters, the right to submit questions and
laws to the voters for acceptance or rejection v.hen the nor ­
mal political processes do not work and it is this process,
this narrow process that Massachusetts seeks to eliminate
corporate influence from.
Throughout the 70-year period, as I say

we have

had a history of interaction between the questions which
appear on the ballot and the ban on corporate contributions
but it has not been a static history.
Throughout our history we have evolved the statute
and the statute now, we think, at least complies with consti­
tutional standards.
For the last 14 years, there has been a dialog
between our State Supreme Judicial Court and between the
Legislature as to what it is that tha Legislature can pres­
cribe by way of corporate contributions.

V

We have carved out a process for the

people

32
within which they can interact and at the same time strive to
protect the rights of businesses to contribute to questions
which in some way might materially affect them.
Under the Massachusetts statutory framework,
individual citizens can contribute up to $1,000 to a candi­
date, to a committee organised on behalf of a candidate, to
a political party or to committees organized on behalf of
questions which appear on the ballot.,
Business corporations and any kind of business
entity which carries on certain kinds of en umere ted businesses
generally-regulated industries like banks, canals, railroads
cannot contribute to candidates, cannot contribute to com­
mittees organised on their behalf, cannot contribute to poli­
tical parties.
There is a narrow range of participat ion open to
them under the Massachusetts framework and it permits them
to contribute to questions which materially affect their
business and only in those instances.
And I might add that when that narrow ranee of
participation is open to them, unlike individual citizens
they can contribute without limit and they may expend; money
without limit in order to protect the business interests.
Now, corporations are not totally excluded: from
the referendum process, the amendment to the constitution
process.

They uave a number of roles that they can tlav in

33

the process,
In order for a constitutional amendment like the
graduated income tax to appear on the Massachusetts ballot,
it has to first be affirmatively voted on by two consecutive
legislatures,
Now, that is not two legislative years, that is
two separately-elected legislatures.
QUESTION:

Weil, the banks could not contribute to

any of those legislators, could they?
MR. EILEY:

Banks cannot contribute to the legis­

lators in their quest for elective office.

What they can do

and what any business -— any artificial or natural entity in
Massachusetts can do is

contribute and expend money in a

lobbying effort while the matter is being considered in the
legislature.

You mean that the bank here can contri­

MR. KILEY:

It is a standard kind of statute.
My question was, unlimited money.

MR. KILEY:

Unlimited expenditures for legislative

agents, yes.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

General Kiley, is that only true if the

graduated income tax materially affects the businet f of the
corporation?
MR. KILEY:
QUESTION:

That is not.
On any issue, they can lobby without

limit.
MR. KILEY:

That is correct, Your Hon:>r.

Any

artificial entity, any natural person in the Cons nor; wealth is
free to expend unlimited amounts of money while a ratter is
before the legislature.

35
QUESTION:
it

I have just one small question.

Why is

that a bank is allowed to spend unlimited money in the

legislature to lobby for or against an act but cannot: do it
through the referendum?

MR. KILEY;

My answer, Mr. Justice Mars

is

that in Article 48 of our State Constitution, we have carved
out for the people a certain process by which they can res­
pond and enact statutes and amend their constitution when the
normal political processes are not available to them and un­
toward results are being produced by the legisleture.
The initiative and referendum procedure which is
at the heart of the issue in this case, was borr. of a. popu­
list movement around, the turn of the century anc was designed
to return to the people

the reins of government, and to

eliminate the big business influence in that narrow range of
governmental interests.
QUESTION:

But there is an ironic twist, is there

not- in that the legislature overwhelmingly passed the income
tax and then the people rejected it.

You have the fact that they were defeated.

You also know that the amount: of money that was

way you —

To the legislature or to the voters?
No, that is to the voters.

That is in

That is in contributions to committe os which

favor or oppose the question in 1372.

It was presented to

the voters in 1972.
But this is not an absolute ban on corporate par­
ticipation even while the people's process, the referendum
process, was going on.

In view of corporate management,

there is the lower court opinion which makes clear it can be
disseminated to the public in a wide variety of ways.
The banks may publish articles in the- in-house
publications.

They may hold press conferences.

They may

use the economists that they have hired to make public state­
ments.

There is a whole host of methods for that corporate

view to be disseminated to the public.
The only restrictior that is operative during
these months immediately preceding election is t prohibition
against the expenditure of corporate funds to influence a
vote which in this case may hare affected the ccrp rate
management in their taxation but could hot have affected the
taxation of the corporations.
After the amendment passes, this is not a self­
executing amendment.

In order for- a tax to be imposed, it

would again have to go back to the legislature and the

income tax and the —
QUESTION:

Would there be a bar that you know of

for the officers to give interviews to newspapermen and to
broadcasting stations about the problem?
MR. KILEY:

The lower court opinion, I think, in

a narrowing construction of the statute makes perfectly clear
that there is no prohibition.

It is the contribution or

expenditure of funds not in the natural course of business
that .is interdicted by the Massachusetts statute.
And again, after the amendment is passed when it
is before the legislature, the Appellants' business corpora­
tions and regul ifced industries have a free hand in seeking to
protect their interest when a specific tax is proposed so
the prescription operates only in a very narrow time frame
during what I have characterized as the people's process.
And in a really significant respect, the rights
of corporations when they can participate in that process are
even greater than those of individual citizens because they
can spend or expend monies —
QUESTIONi

General Kiley, is it not true that if

your position is correct, as a matter of constitutional law
Massachusetts could withdraw the privilege of trying to in­
fluence the legislature by spending money?
M.'lo KILEY:

I think that if my position on the

constitutional aspects of the case is correct, that Massa­
chusetts can clearly eliminate the right of corporations to
lobby except where their business interests are affected.
QUESTION:

And as a matter of law, they can say

that their business interests are not affected by an indivi­
dual income tax.
MR. KILEY:

I do not know whether the judgment in

the particular statute would be as defensible as it is in the
matter that is before this Court.
QUESTION:

How would that be different?

I do not

understand how that would matter, whether that is the consti­
tutional amendment or the statute.
MR. KILEY: In this particular question that was
presented to the voters, we have a non-self-executing state­
ment of authorization for the legislature which deals; only
with personal income as opposed to corporate income taxes.
Passing the question of whether or not a personal
income tax can have an impact on the business property or
assets of the corporation, we are still faced with the fact
that in order for there to be any conceivable impact on the
business itself, the legislature at some point would have to
take an additional affirmative step and impose

With the votes in the record, there is

not much doubt about that, what is going to happen when you
get to that stage, is there?

There may be grave questione as to

the form of the particular tax, the levels of taxation, the
degrees of gradation.,
QUESTION:

General Kiley, why does your constitu­

tional position limit you so that you have to allow a corpor­
ation to spend money when its own business interests are
materially affected?

Is there a constitutional right of

self-defense?
MR. KILEY:

I would start with the bald proposi­

tion that corporations have no First Amendment xigats of
free speech per se.

I would agree with the Court below that

to the extent that corporations do have any rights of speech,
that they are an incident of the Due Process Cleuse cf the

QUESTION:

No and certainly it is not the position

the Court has taken but it seems to me that your case is on
stronger grounds if you say that one must first pass through
the person loophole of the 14th Amendment than if you say the
14th Amendment without any reference to any of its language
sa/s no state shall abridge the freedom of speech or freedom
of the press.
MR. KILEY:

I think that I would agree with you,

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. KILEY:

Yes.

And which position do you take?

The position that I advance today is

simply that the lower court has found that there in a right
to protect businesses, whether it is under the Federal
Constitution or the State Constitution and that we will abide
by that decision by the lower court, under the State Consti­
tution if not the federal.
QUESTION:

But which position do you take with

respect to the First and 14th Amendments to the Federal
Constitution?
MR. KILEY:
QUESTION:

I would take a position -Do you think you first have bo show you

are a person in order to take advantage of the First Amend­
ment?

41
MR. KILEY:

I would say that you do not and you

would not simply because there is a right of speech when busi­

leges and immunities clause of the amendment.

What, is your position?

It is very confusing, it seems

42
MR. KILEY;

The challenge that was brought to the

specific statute embodies a host of due process - equal pro­
tection kinds of challenges.

The Appellants challenged the

statute on*its face and as applied to them and asserted that
there was a constitutional right to contribute or expend
money when there was a material affect.
Justice Learchos in his opinion appears to have
agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment and the State Constitu­
tion confer that kind of right and finds that as applied to
these particular defendants, this statute is not unconstitu­
tional.

He also appears to concur with the legislative judg­

ment that a graduated income tax amendment on its face can
have no impact on the

business interests

of specific cor­

porations .
In accordance with the provisions of Rule 16 of
this Court, I will turn just briefly and just by way of di­
gression to the moo tries s arguments that have been raised in
this particular case.
I agree with Mr. Fox that there is a doctrine which
has been applied by this and other courts permitting it to
review and decide cases which are capable of repetition yet
evading review even after the specific controversy has passed.
We disagree as to the application of the principle
to this particular case.

We do not believe, as Mr. Fox

asserts, that this case is likely to recur in any real sense.

l

43
In the 16 years since we have had our current form
of amending the Constitution and in the 29 general elections
that have passed, a graduated income tax question has appeared
on the ballot but four times and three judicial challenges
that, eventuated challenging the corporate prescription against
contributions to oppose or favor that tax.
But in each instance, the nature of the specific
amendment, the form, of the prescription embodied in Chapter
55, Section 8 and its precursors and the form of the specific
challenge that a judicial challenge eventuated has varied.

I.

would submit that it is sheer speculation to suggest that if
a First Amendment argument is again raised and if the legis­
lature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts again nuts a.
grad tax on the ballot ahd if corporations again w mt to
oppose it, that these issues .will arise between th.-ae parti-1:;,
that there ha these; same

issues or that it will fciia thin

format..
Furthermore, in the second part of the analysis,
tu-fS record amply illustrates this case, the First National
yenl versus Belotti- did not arise in a time ’ fr&me so short
'-het complete Appellate review was impossible.
The Appellants could have brought their case* as
the lower court noted in Note 15 of its Opinion, a full yeabefore they did bring their case.

Had they brought their

case reasonably close to the date on which the controversy

44
arose and had they sought and obtained expedited review in
light of the impending election, the Appellants clearly could
have obtained plenary consideration by this Court within the
available time frame.
Their delay and their delay only is the reason
that they have not managed to obtain complete Appellate review
in this case.
Under these circumstances, the capable of repeti­
tion yet evading review doctrine is inapposite and the case
has become moot.
Turning once again to the First Amendment issues
that have been raised, the Commonwealth has search, sd three
basic interests which we think justify any incidental impact
that this statute night have on any imagined First Amendment
rights.
We start first from the proposition though, that
corporations do not have First Amendment rights per se, that
they are not natural persons and that they may be restricted
to protection oi the rights that are contained in their
charters.
The Fourteenth Amendment is not inapplicable to
V

these Appellants because they are artificial entitles.
QUESTION:

If this ware a First. Amendment case

strictly speaking and in the Fedora1 Government, y u would
not be dealing with any question of whether they ware natural

45
persons because the First Amendment by its terms does not
require that it be a person to take advantage of it.
MR. KILEY:

I think, though, that this Court has

never held chat the First Amendment rights per se, the right
of free speech

per se, attaches to business corporations

whose charters do not relate either to the press, the communi­
cation of ideas or the advancement of other first Amendment
rights or, in the alternative, unless there has been some
finding of a business interest.
The business corporations are simply quite
different from natural persons and the opinions of this Court
have held that they do not exercise other purely personal,
rights such as the privilege again it self-incrimination,
right of —
QUESTION:

Let us see if I understand this.

How

do you explain the presence of the New York Times case?
MR. KILEY:

involved in the dissemination of news and was involved in the
business of the First Amendment.

Again, protection of arguably a busi­

Like the commercia1 speech case, I would

assert that in every case in which a pure — in which a

46
right of speech has been found, that there is either a busi­
ness interest as in the commercial speech cases or that there
is an idea of dissemination of First Amendment ideas.
QUESTION:

I think in most of those cases, the

First Amendment issue was not specifically raised in the
sense, is it applicable or not to a corporation problem.
MR. KILEY:

1 think, Mr. Justice Blackman, that

Mr, Foxes answer to the Court was —- and I believe it was to
Mr. Justice Stewart's question — was as good an answer as
could be provided.

There are no cases which hold directly

that the First Amendment right of free speech per are applies
to business corporations as such.
The issue is — this is, 1 would submit, a fairly
unique case.
QUESTION:

What would you say about the proposi-

tion that corporations could be-organized in such a way that
after the declaration of corporate purpose would b* a state­
ment generally,

"And to engage in the dissemination of infor­

mation and knowledge necessary for the well-being if the
United States and the people thereof."

Would that give them

First Amendment rights then?
'4R. KILEYt

If that was also the charts r of the

New York Times J would clearly answer yes,
QUESTION:

Well, I do not know what the Hew York

HlBS. charter says, but it must be. something like that.

47
MR. KILEYs

The reason that I would answer yes is

that when an individual invests his money in a corporation
like the Mew York Times or like the Boston Globe, there is
the idea that his money will be utilized in the dissemination
of certain ideas.
When an individual invests his money in Digital
Corporation, in Wyman-Gordon, in the First National Bank,
there is an expectation on the part of the individual that his
funds -- that the corporation will exercise ifes best efforts
to protect his investment and to enhance his investment and
that to the extent that political contributions and political
messages are not his views, that permitting corporations to
make political statements is an opportunity for the corpora­
tion to — the corporate management to abuse the trust placed
~i; them on the one hand and at bast? and at worst, to coerce
contributions from their shareholders, to use their funds for
purposes which are ir.imicab.le to their own constitutional and
political beliefs and I think that that, is antithetical to
the real purpose behind the First Amendment»
I see my time is passing and X just want to make
sure that I get to assert one time the three interests that
we say the state has ii restricting speech of this nature.
First, ws think that the state has a legitimate
interest in preserving the integrity of the referendum ini­
tiative and amendment processes as the people's forum.

Second, we think that there is a legitimate state
interest in preventing even the appearance of impropriety a.2
it relates to that process and by that 1 mean that we feel
that we have the right to remove even the suggestion of a
domination by corporations in the political sphere.
Now, that is not an imaginary evil.

In 1972 the

corporations -- many corporations banded together and spent
$120,000 to oppose the graduated income tax as opposed to
$7,000 or $15,000 by the proponents.
Now, that is not the same undue influence argument
that the; Court, in Mr. Foxes view laid to rest in Buckley and
Valleo.

We are not saying that an individual who is a

millionaire cannot use his funds to promote his political
beliefs or that an individual who is talented iri political
debate cannot use his talents.
What we are asserting to the Court is that the
state has a right of keeping corporations which do not belong
in the initiative process in the first place from preventing
a .lull and robust debate among those individuals who have a
direct interest in the correct answering of the questions
before the Court.
And the third interest that we assert to the
Court is that the state has a legitimate interest in pro­
tecting the minority shareholders of these individual cor­
porations and I would suggest to the Court that Co t versus

49
Ash has not said that protection of minority shareholders is
a secondary interest at best, that Cort. and_ Ash is a statu­
tory construction case in which this Court did not find the
existence of an implied civil right of action under the
federa .1 election.

QUESTION:

MR. KILEY:

Correct.

And in fact, in the opinion

below, Mr. Justice Loarchos has indicated that in his view,
protection of minority interests is a very important element
of the Massachusetts statute.
QUESTION:

General, may I come back to the ques­

tion 1 asked you a little while ago?

Will you take a look

at page 19 of the Appendix of the Jurisdictional
MR, KILEY:

statement?

Certainly.
This i« the opinion of your court and

t* at part of the opinion is addressing the vagueness argu­
ment and look at the second full paragraph that starts,

"On

consideration of, these constitutional guidelines" which are

50

cases involving vagueness, the next sentence goes on to say
tiiiss "We recognise that the ’materially affects’ limitation
is general in nature."

The court is thus saying it is not

vague.
"But we also note that the statutory proscription
in question hare — the prohibition against corporate expendi
tures on a referendum question solely concerning a personal
income tax — ie both precise and definite."
Now, I read that plus the language I referred to
earlier as indicating that your court would say that quite
without regard to affect on the business or assets of a Cor­
poration, that money could not be spent.
Now, do you agree or disagree with that interpre­
tation of this opinion?

I think that

no reasonable man viewing the dialog between Supreme Court
and legislature in this case could argue that this statute
is vague.
Indeed, Mr. Fox, in his brief, concedes that this
prescription was tailor-made to apply to him.
