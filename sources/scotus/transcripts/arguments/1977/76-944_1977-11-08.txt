Judge Sirica agreed with that consensus and denied

the r©quests.
A few weeks later but still during the trial, formal
applicant mis were filed by the respondents in this case to

Those applications were assigned

ho Judge Crc&il of the District Court and were opposed by
Mr. Nixon.

Judge Sirica, like Judge Gesell, noted that, in his opinion,

And the only thing that the respondents

have claimed in this case—they do not really claim a right
to a' copy of the entirety of the court copy, tha trial copy,
of the tapes.

As; I have paid, that trial copy contains many

conversations that arc still confidential.

Actually the item

that the respondents claim i right to copy docs not now exist.
They ask that ' that item—i.e., a tape of all tie conversations
that wore played to the jury-—be produced.

Q

Is it perfectly clear that the portions of the

tapes that, were not played to the jury are not involved here?
MR, JEFFRESS:

to them, Mr, Justice White.

Q

Why would they not have a right?

MR, JEFFRESS:

We submit that their argument wonId

seem to establish that they would.

They, however, appear to

concede that 'those conversations—
Q

I suppos® I should ask them why they concede

that.
MR. JEFFRESS:
Q

That is correct.

There is no property-interest claim here, is

there, because the Congress in. effect condemned the originals
under the act we construed last spring?
MR. JEFFRESS:

If the Court recalls, the Court did

not rule on the actual title to the tapes.

And the Court will

also recall that Mr. Nixon had claimed a title to those tapes.
Q

You still do, do you net?

MR. JEFFRESS :
Q

And we still do.

If Mr. Nixon did have title to those tapes,

Congress has provided just compensation for hin in that act.
MR. JEFFRESS:
G

That is correct.

So, he would have no property claim 3 n this

case.
MR. JEFFRESS:

No issue in the case depend; on

whether he has title to the recordings or not.

As I have said

before, if these, were wira-tap recordings, the same issues
•*

would b® present.

Or if they were subpoenaed from my custody

15
and they might belong to my brother-in-law or whatever, I do
not think that that would control any issue that is presented
in this case.
Q

Mr, Jeffreys, who in general were parties to

these conversations in addition to the president?
MR. JEFFRESS:

The president and his closest aides

would summarize it generally.

The conversations primarily

concern Mr,. Mixon and certain members of the cabinet and
certain members of the Whites House staff.
Q

Are any parties recorded in thea® tapes who

ware not. associated with the White House?
MR. JEFFRESS:

There are parties who ware recorded

on the original recordings that are in Judge Sirica’s custody.
If I recall correctly, there are not any portions that were
actually playad to the jury that involved such persons.
Q

Mr. Jeffress, your argument is being recorded

on that machine over there.

Are you suggesting that, there is

any limitation on this Court from releasing the tape of your
argument to the media or anyone else?
MR. JEFFRESS:

If the Court please, it is my under­

standing that the Court does impose certain restrictions on
release of the oral arguments.
Q
that, there arc

That was not my question.

Are you suggesting

limitations on our power to release the.

recording'of your azgumenc?

IS
MR. JEFFRESS:
Q

No, X do not think so, Your Honor.

How is this any different from the racording

that we are talking about?
MR. JEFFRESS:

The recordings we are talking about

are not the property of the Court.

They were obtained by

judicial process for a limited purpose from Mr

Nixcn,.

There

are reasons, we would submit, why courts do not. and should rot
allow the broadcast of recordings made of judicial proceedings.
But at the least those recordings are the court’s recordings.
They are recordings that the court has the absolute power to
do with as they please.
Q

We could release them if we decided to do so

for playing on the 6:00 o'clock news tonight, or the 7:00
©8 clock news, whenever it comes on.
Q

And you are still drawing the distinction

between the transcript, which is readily available to any
attorney, and the original tap© with all the voice inflections
arid everything els®.
MR. JEFFRESS:

Certainly, Your Honor.

We submit

that the Court cf Appeals decision that, th© common-law right
involved th© right to cop;/ tape recordings in th© custody of
th© clerk is inconsistent with the recognition-—th© uniform
racognition by the courts up to this time—that a tap® is
different from a transcript.
Q

And I might point out—

But you do not make that distinction us to your

17
own argument here.

Your argument is being recorded by that

machine, and it: also will be transcribed, and there will be a
•transcript of it after this argument.

Do you still suggest

there is no limitation on our power to release the voice
recording with all its inflections and everything else to the
news media for broadcast tonight, if they want to?
MR. JEFFRESS:

But if the Court please. this is a

public-—
Q

Then you do not?

MR. JEFFRESS:
Q

No.

You do not?

MR. JEFFRESS:

No, I do not contend that.

But if

the Court please, where you have wire-tapped conversations,
where you have privately recorded conversations that are
obtained by judicial proces-:, you have a different kind of
animal than you have in a recording that a person makes with
expectation that it is: being made in public discour.se, with
an expectation that it is even being mad© over television,

it

is not unusual for participants in private conversations to
speak irrever@ntly.
Q

Was not all of that lost one© it was played in

court?
MR. JEFFRESS:
Q

No, Your Honor, it was not.

It was lost as to 12 people, was it not?

MR. JEFFRESS:

The only thing that was lost—

18

Q

Was it not?

MR. JEFFRESS:

The 12 people on the jury heard it.

But we have said. Your Hon' r, and

contend—
Q

Or you do not think that means anything?

MR. JEFFRESS:
Q

I do not think that it means-—

It is no longer private, is it?

MR. JEFFRESS:

It is no longer private.

The only

thing lost—
Q

Then what are you arguing, limit it?

MR. JEFFRESS:

We do not argue that there is an

interest in confidentiality per se that is still maintained as
to these tapes.

We do argue that there is a legitimate

interest, an interest that the Court may respect, and an
interest that the Court should respect in a person whose
private conversations are recorded anc. which contains the same
sort of language, the same sort of discourse that would ha—

MR. JEFFRESS:

No, I do not believe it would be.

very purpose for which the tapes would be produced.
be played to do justice in a criminal proceeding.

It would
That is

the purpose for which the tape recordings were produced.
Q

And that is the reason that the respondents

want to re-reproduce it for the public.

It is a little larger

public.
MR. JEFFRESS:

They want, to have it in a form where

it can ba played in any manner that they think appropriate.
Broadcast on television, that is the purpose of some of the
respondents.

Others of the respondents say they would like to

provide it for home use, for library use, for scholarly
purposes.

But the fact i.s that once released—-the point I

was trying to make before—
Q

But ny point is it has already been released.

MR. JEFFRESS:

It has not, lour Honor, been

released in the sense that copies have been provided for these
uses.

We submit that in these private conversations that are

recorded, whether 'wiretap or otherwise, it is one thing.
is going to be embarrassing to the participants .

It­

It. is going

to cause them pain for those conversations to be disclosed.
for these conversations to be printed in transcripts: and
disseminated.

Q

Mr. Jeffress, as you know, there are some states

20

•that televise trial proceedings.

Suppose this had been a

televised trial so that, the recordings at issue here had been
broadcast in the course of the trial.

Would you still be

making the argument you are?
MU, JEFFRESS:

Yes, Your Honor, we would.

And

interestingly enough where at least the canon of judicial
ethics permits the televised court proceedings

it requires

the consent of the witnesses and the parties and of the
counsel, 'which is essentially a waiver, a decision that that
sort, of intrusion on their privacy ought to be made.
Q

This Court has never he.d any occasion to decide

whether a defendant can refuse or a witness can refuse to
appear if the proceeding is broadcast, has it?
MR, JEFFRESS:

Wo, Your Honor, I do not believe it

has.
Q

The Estes case was the closest, I guess.

MR. JEFFRESS:

The Estes cast would be the closest,

but that was a matter of due process to the defendant.
Q

Mr. Jeffress, may I ask a question about how to

go about deciding this case?

I gather you would agree that

in some instances it is appropriate to permit public copying
and access to exhibits and in others it is not, depending or
the impact on the privacy of the witness or the. person
producing the exhibit.
argument.

1' think that ir implicit in your

If that is true, how is one to decide whether or not

21
to release something like this without hearing it?

And that

then leads to the question, Should we not, have som® kind of
obligation to defer to the District Court, which has heard
these materials which we have not heard?
MR. JEFFRESS:

I would like to make two responses

to that, Mr. Justice Stevens.

First, I do not think you

interpret my argument correctly when you assumo that it is a
matter involving the balancing of particular privacy interests
in a particular case against 'whatever needs the public asserts
for the material.
Where a subpoenaed exhibit that is not the property
of the court comes into the custody of the court, we submit
■that the court should not, as a policy matter, make those
available bayond the uses for which they were subpoenaed.
Non© of the authorities recognize that the court has any such
power—not ths Manual fox District Court Clerks , not' any of
the common-law cases.
The second responsa that I would 1.1k® to make to that
Mr. Justice Stevens, is that in this particular case no dis­
trict judge has exercised this discretion, ©van if it is e
matter of discretion, to make release of the recordings.
As to exhibits, if an exhibit is obtained, the
question arises, Is there a distinctio:-:, between documentary
and taped exhibits that come into the custody of the court
under subpoena?

Even as 'to documentary exhibits-—

22
Q

May I just stop you for a moment?

You say the

general rule is that no copying is permitted except in
exceptional circumstances?

Judge Gesell certainly thought

the law was to the contrary on that.
MR. JEPPRESS:

Judge Gesell found a practice is the

District Court for the District of Columbia that exhibits
were routinely made available for copying subject to contrary
directions by the trial judge.

So far as we are aware, no

instance had aver arisen where there, number one, anyone had
actually copied a taps recorded exhibit or, number two, anyone
had copied any exhibit obtained from a private party over his
objection,
Q

Should the: rule be different for tape recordings

than for any other document or pictures or anything like that?
Should you not. have a general rule applying to all exhibits'?
MR. JEFFRESS:

We submit that there are reasons for

a distinction, but we do contend that there should be &
general rule for all exhibits.

If a party, for example, under

subpoena produces a photograph and there are reasons why that,
person, who has the entire power to control what is done with
that photograph except for the subpoena, there are reasons to
respect that person’s wishes, if he should make the request,
that that document ?..ot be provided for showing on television
or in newspapers.
Q

If that- is true t why do you make a motion to

23
seal the record?

That is the exception, not the rule,

MR. JEPPRESS:
Q

But if the Court please—

Is that true, that sealing the record is the

exception and not the rule?
MR, JEFFRESS:

Sealing the record is the exception

9

but—
*

Q

Then why do you do that if it is; already

sealed?
MR, JEFFRESS:
Q

Why do you not-~

You said it is already sealed.

You cannot

copy it.
MR. JEFFRESSs

The party could make a request for

sealing of the record, but T. might point out—
Q

You mean if you go in the clerk's office and

say, "I want to see the exhibits in such and such a case,"
they just hand them to you and you arc; allowed to copy them?
MR. JEFFRESS:
in most jurisdictions.

They do not, Your Honor.

They do not

There are three rules in fact, actual

rules ©f district courts that prohibit that, except to the
parties to the case.
If the Court please, I woulc like ■>© reserve the
rest of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Jeffrees.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to start by trying to be as clear as I
can about precisely what the tapes are that involved her© and
the degree to which they have already come into the public
domain.

Some of these tapes wars subpoenaed by Special

Prosecutor Cox in 1973.

And after the Court ©:: Appeals

ordered them to be turned over by Mr. Nixon and after
Mr. Cox's dismissal, they ware turned over.
subpoenaed by Special Prosecutor Jaworski.

0idler3 ware
And after this

Court's ruling in 1974, they were turr.sd over.
Tilth respect, to the tapes involved hare, we do not
deal with any other than those introduced as exhibits in the
Mitchell trial.

All were heard in open court.

And indeed all

ware hoard not just by the 12 jurors, Mr. Justice Marshall,
but. by everyone in the court because everyone that came into
the court was provided with earphones so that they could be
heard by everyone.

The computation in this case is that

something on the order of 1300 individuals heard sore or all
of the tapes„

Bo, everyone in the courtroom heard everything

that is at issue in this case.
printed.

And all of the tapes have been

And, as Mr. Nixon's brief correctly states, all of

the tapes, the transcripts of them, continue to bs available;

25
around the country for public reading and reflection.
Q

That is the printed transcripts.

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, sir, all of the printed transcripts

are available.
What has been missing from the public is what we came
to court to seek, the right of

the public not present in court

to hear the tapes that everyone in court, heard.

There is no

question here about the ability to reproduce these tapes
without destroying the original tape from -which they were
made.

The clerk of the court so stated in his affidavit, and

we have not heard anything to the contrary frost Mr. Nixon,
Nor is there any issue as to Mr. Nixon seeking their return in
any sense of these tapes.

His reply brief submitted to this

Court last week explicitly disclaimed any effort on his part
to

get these teipas back

from the

clerk—page

brief.
The legal issue?, as we see it, that are before
this Court are relatively narrow.

But before 1 reach them, I

would Ilk® to ba very clear as to what Judge Gesell held in
his opinion which the Court of Appeals correctly stated it was,
as it were, affirming.

Judge Sesell*s first opinion—-only

opinion, as it. were,, in this case—said in so many words that'
the tape exhibits are in evidence—I am quoting now—and have
therefore corns into the public domain and the public should have
a chance to hear them.

Mr. Nixon's opposition was denied by

26

Judge Gesell.

Judge Gessll, to be sure, required us to

formulate a plan for distribution of the tapes and a plan which
would avoid certain commercialisation and the like.

We

submitted a plan? it was rejected by Judge Gessll.
Judge Sirica then, held a hearing and refused to-—
Q

Why was he concerned about commercialisation?

If it is open, why not commercialize it?
MR. ABRAMS;

Mr. Justice Blackraun, I think he was

improperly concerned about commercialization after the
initial distribution of the tape.

I think it was quit©

within the Court's province to say that in the first instance,
when the tapes were to be reproduced—-that is to say, a
master tape made and initially distributed, to the public—-I
think it was proper, at least we take no quarrel with the
proposition, that an to that he could properly say that -the
Court, should say that there should bo no commercialization.
The only problem that w© have with Judge Gesell*s opinion It
that he may have inferred-—we do not think he cid in his first
opinion,

a, incidentally, did not think he did in

his first opinion—he may have inferred that after the tapes
were out to the public, that there were constitutional
limitations which could be placed on its use.

In so far as

Judge Gesell did believe that, we think he was incorrect.
Q

Do you have any quarrel with Judge Gesell*s

suggestion that whatever plan you came up with, you had to pay

2?
for the time of the clerk of 'the court and that you could not
just turn the court into an annex of CBS in order to get the
tapes—
MR. ABRAMS:

We have no problem with that at all»

Justice Rehnquist, and we have now submitted to the Court a
plan which would take everything off the Court’s hands, underwhich the National Archives would take full responsibility
for the making of th© tape and the distributiori of the tape
to the public at minimal cost.

We do not need and we do not

seek any aid from the Court here at all, save the ability to
have these tapes reproduced by the National Archives and then
distributed generally to the public.
Q

Mr. Abrams, how about my question to

Mr. Jeffress on the parts of the tapes, of the original tapes
or the copies of the tapes, that were not played to the jury?
MR. ABRAMS:
White.

They are not involved here, Mr. Justice

We have taken the position in this case, that all we

are seeking are, court exhibits.

The material which Judge

Sirica received, which was not admitted into evidence, we
had made no claim for in this case.

They have never been made

available generally to th© public.

They were tot heard in open

court.
Q

But they were subpoenaed.

MR. ABRAMS:

Q

Yes.

They were lodged in court and they are still

28
there, ar© they not?
MR, ABRAMS:
public record.

They are in court, but they are not

They are in Judge Sirica's vault, as it were.

And they are under a protective order.
Q

So are the tapes you are after there in his

vault.
MR. ABRAMS:
Q

Yes, sir.

Who knows whether they are public records?

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, the question is whether they are

public records.
Q

How do you distinguish between the two, the

parts that were played to the jury and the parts that were not?
MR. ABRAMS:
exhibits.

Because the parts we seek arc

court

The parts wa seek were played—
Q

You mean they were admitted.

MR. ABRAMS:
Q

Admitted into evidence.

MR. ABRAMSs
Q

They were admitted.

Into evidence.

Is that as far as you go on exhibits?

MR. ABRAMS:

That; is all we are seeking, Your Honor,

yes.
Q

1

die not ask that.

Doas your theory only g©

that far?
MR. ABRAMS:

Our theory goes this far.

Wo think

the Court of Appeals was correct in saying that as a general

29
matter, materials held by the Court are available to the
public'—as a general matter—at least in the context where
they are court exhibits and have been admitted into evidence.
There is material, to be sure-—grand jury, for
example, we are told,
jury.

The material is submitted to a grand

That is not, by anyone's standards, public i nformation.

And we do not. seek any such information.

We do not take the

position in this case, Mr. Justice White, that we are entitled
to everything that, finds its way to court in some fashion or
another.

We accept the proposition of the Court of Appeals

that there are situations in which things, even when intro­
duced in evidence, rnay not be made publicly available for one
reason or another.

Of course if it is .introduced in evidence

under seal—
Q

What reason?

MR. ABRAMS:

If it is contraband, for example.

it is, for example, pornographic literature.

If

If it is subject

to copyright laws.
Q

How about th'i copyright, laws?

Suppose it war?

copyrighted material that ws,s introduced into evidence.
MR. ABRAMS:

Thera' is case law which we believe is

correctly decided at the lower court level indicating that
copyrighted materials introduced in evidence may not

hC;

reprinted certainly without: violating the copyright law.

As

to whether they may be obtained—I am pursuing Mr. Justice

30
R©hnquist*s question earlier—obtain and where on© could
print, as it were, and take one’s chances, that may be.

We

would not even object to a rule, and we do not even go so far
in this case as to urge a rule, which would routinely allow
anyone to walk in and get ahold of copyrighted material in
that sens®.
Q

There are trademark copyright cases where even

the pleadings are secret.
MR. ABRAMS:
Q

And are sealed.

MR. ABRAMS:
Q

Yes.
Even the pleadings.

Ahsolutely.

what about; the question I put. earlier?

May

this Court impose limitations on the distribution of the
recording of your argument today, limit it to particular
purposes and particular groups, and deny it to CBS or the
news media generally, if we want to?
MR. ABRAMS:

You understand that is u delicate

question for me, Mr» Justice Brennan.
Q

It may be, but I wish you would answer it.

MR. ABRAMSs

I certainly think that there is a vast

distinction between any limitations placed by courts,
including this Court, on the; use of arguments or trials or the
*

like than there is on—
Q

Which way does it cut?

MR. ABRAMS:

We can or carnot?

You have more authority, in ivy view.

31
under authority such as the Estes case to limit the public
dissemination of the tape of this argument than would bs the
case of an exhibit filed in this Court, which I would urge
upon you is more generally available.
Q

You say "more authority."

That does not sound

as though you concede we have plenary, total, and final
authority, do you?
MR. ABRAMS:

Your Honor, I do not deny for a moment

that you have complete authority to do that.

In giving an

answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, what I was attempting
to urge was that it would give me a lot of constitutional
qualms if you were to limit the accessibility of court
exhibits in this very courthouse.

I could not deny that you

could do it, but it would seem to me inconsistent with many
years of American practice.
Q

That is academic perhaps because you could get

them before they got here.
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes , and if other courts were 'ho do. the

same thing, I would make fchcs same argument to them.
Q

1 am not sure how my Brother Brennan reacts to

your answer to his question, but it seems to me a perfectly
good answer exactly the opposite to which you gave could be
made, that an exhibit furnished by a third party and simply
drawn into court by judicial process perhaps ought to have more
protection from dissemination than the proceedings of a public

32
body that are pursuant to rule and that do not involve any
unwilling participation by third parties.
MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Rehnquist, I cannot be put in the

position of disagreeing that the constitutional arguments for
limiting dissemination of the arguments here are very weak.

I

think that there is a strong constitutional case to be made for
having as public a disclosure as is possible of this very
proceeding.

X take iu the reason it is not made available

are the kinds of reasons that are referred to in the Estes
case, the possibility of inhibiting counsel, affecting the
dignity of the court proceedings.

Our positior that you can­

not inhibit an exhibit, that there is nothing in what is
involved in this case which is analogous—
Q

Why do you get to a. constitutional question?

Is it not in both cases basically a housekeeping question of
what a particular court is going to do with material physically
in its possession?
MR. ABRAMS:

As a. housekeeping matter, Justice

Relinquish, it does seem to us to have long-standing roots< -%s
the Court, of Appeals said.

But as a general matter, copies

may be made of things held in courts, subject to exceptions and
subject ‘ho abuse.

But. as a general proposition, court records

arcs available to be inspected by the public and copied by tlrs
public.
Q

Do you go so far as to say that the Constitution

33

requires this Court to maintain that taping process ever there?
MR, ABRAMS:
Honor?

The taping of this proceeding, Your

No, I would not, Your Honor,
Q

It seems to me—

So, we could do away with it and not violate

the Constitution?
MR. ABRAMS:
Q

I think so, Your Honor.

Do you claim a constitutional right, to get

these tapes?
MR. ABRAMS:
Justice White.

We do make a constitutional argument,

We do argue that, pursuant to izhe Cox

Broadcasting case, or at least pursuant to the same theory
as the Cox Broadcasting case, which is; not this case, that
there is a lot more-—
Q

Cox did not gc that far.

MR. ABRAMS:
to suggest that it did.

No, sir, it did not.

And I do not mean

It is our position in this case that

if Cox is correctly read, as I do, as saying that there is an
advantage to the public in -the widespread dissemination of
information even as offensive as the name of a rape victim
and that the privacy interests and the father of a rape
victim can be overcome, must be overcome, because the informa­
tion is contained in a court record.
By parity of reasoning in this case, court exhibits
introduced in evidence, not to say these court exhibits
introduced in evidence, should b© made public.

34
Q

Short of a constitutional &rgumant, what are

you arguing?
MR. ABRAMS:
we

Short of a constitutional argument,

,

argue, as did the Court of Appeals

that there is a long­

standing common-law practice and right to make copies of court
documents and to make copies of court exhibits , that this
right is not an absoluta right, that it has exceptions to it,
that none of the potential exceptions to it ought to be
applied in this case, and that indeed there is a very signifi­
cant argument to be made in favor of release of these tapes,
I would put it this way, Justice White-—we think
that even if the Court of Appeals had adopted *.n opposite
test, a presumption against release of information such as
this instead of on® placing the burden on Mr. Nixon, we think
w® could meet \

;his case'.

We think ir

s case

there is such a public interest and there is such a public
utility ir. having these tapes made available that m an if the
presumption were against us, we could neat it.
Thank you.

Mr. Williams.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, WARNER
COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
MR. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I think it would be useful if I spent just a couple

35
of minutes, if the Court please, identifying what

I conceive

■to be the non-issues in this case which have been raised as
questions in the courts below in the tortuous journey of this
case over three years to this courtroom.
First of all, the peg to which Judge Sirica latched
his memorandum and order is now moot.

There are no more

prospectiva defendants, no more prospective trials and, there­
fore, no more prospective prejudice.
Secondly, we are not here contending that in every
single instance there is a right to inspect and copy and
distribute every exhibit that, goes into a courtroom in the
trial of a case.

We recognize that in the ercei else of dis­

cretion of -the ferial judge there may he instances where he
will deny that right where there are property rights involved,
where there* are illegal wiretaps which are offered in evidence,
where in a wiretapping criminal case, for example, or where
there is contraband offered as part of the prosecution's case
in a criminal trial.
Q

Do you think, in other words, it; is pretty much

in the trial judge’s discretion?
MR, WILLIAMS:

I think there is an exercise of dis­

cretion here for the trial judge, Mr. Justice Stewart.
We are: not hero assailing the traditional rules of
court which preclude access end distribution of the tape
recordings of trials or indeed of court, arguments.

We are not

36

here making that assault»
Q

Mr- Williams , would it be a valid reason for a

trial judge to deny the right to copy if he felt that the
material would be embarrassing to a witness and might
discourage future prospective witnesses from wanting to come
forward and testify in trials and so forth?
MR. WILLIAMS;

I do not think, Your Honor, that

embarrassment per se would be a legitimate reason for denial
of access.

Indeed, I think that is what petitioner’s position

is reduced to.
Q

How about a photograph of someone hurt in an

automobile accident or a particularly unattractive photograph,
something like that?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think that would be within the

discretion of tbs court.
0

Would it be a permissible reason to deny on the

ground of embarrassment to the witness?
MR. WILLIAMS:

If there were a proprietary right

and if-Q

Ho; no proprietary right, just; pur© embarrass­

ment.
MR. WILLIAMS:

I do not think embarrassment per se

I

would ba sufficient, Your Honor,
0

Would ever be sufficient.

MR. WILLIAMS;

And I say this with no meanness of

37
spirit,

But I think that is what petitioner‘s argument is

reduced to.

It is that an alleged conspirator has the right

not to he embarrassed by the sound of his inculpatory words
solely because he was president when they ware uttered.

I

think that .is the reducti on of the petitioner ’ s argument in
this case.
Q

Hr. Williams, the Court, of Appeals said the

normal practice is that court exhibits are returned to their
source when the case is over.

These cases are over.

Suppose

the exhibits had been returned and then you wanted to get
them.
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think our position is,, Mr. Justice

White, w© are not engaging in any debate about title.

We are

saying that while they are :ln the custody cf the court, we
have the right to inspect and copy, and they are in the custody
of the court.

And 1 think had they been returned, we would be

on a different footing.
Q

Yes, but the Court of Appeals made its judgment

whan the casas were still going on.

And it said normally tb®

exhibits are returned when the cases are over.

The cases are

over and they have not bean returned.
MR. WILLIAMS:

They have not been returned, Your

Honor, because I understand that the Manual for the Clerks; cf
Court,-which has been promulgated out of a judicial conference,
mandates that records of 'this kind be kept for a period of tan

38
years.

They are in the custody of the Court.

been returned.

They have not

And our position is quits narrow.

It is that

while they are in the custody of the Court, we have a timehonored, traditional common-law right to inspect those
documents and to copy them and make such distribution—
Q

Is it common law for the federal courts?

MR. WILLIAMS:
District of Columbia.

It is a common-law right in the
It has been recognized for 100 years

and—
q

Federal common law.

MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Yes, sir.

In response to Justice Stevens* question,

Mr* williams, you referred to Mr. Nixon's right to claim
embarrassment.

Do you think he has the right lao assert

similar claims or contentions on behalf of people whose voices
might be heard on the tapes?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think he has not, Your Honor.

And

fortunately the persons whose voices were heard on the taper
were all parties defendant, in the case below, captioned
u„s. v. Mitchell, et al., in petition for certiorari was
denied in this Court last spring.
that.

There are exceptions to

There are two advisers to the president who are not

parties defendant to that casa» whose names appear in those
tapes and whose voices are heard on those tapes.

Thsy have not

seen fit to register objection or claim embarrassment.

And I

39
suggest, that that is a concern that can easily be handled at.
the time that the method for distribution is promulgated in
the Federal Register.

They should be given an opportunity to

come in and assert what Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out a few
moments ago, their right not to be embarrassed or their right
if they—
Q

Why should they be given that right?

You say

that is an insufficient basis for an objection anyway.

MR. WILLIAMS:

I think it is an insufficient basis,

but there are a lot of rights which axe asserted with an
insufficient basis such as petitioner’s right in this very
Court, in my opinion.
Q

Mr. Williams, suppose you have a celebrated

criminal case, kidnapping, rape, murder, something of that
kind, and on© of the» claimnl i of evidence introduced et the
trial are statements made which in the aggregate amount to a
confession by the defendant or one of the defendants at some
point, at least at a point where the court admits them in
evidence, and these statements are all on the record now in
■fche trial, not subpoenaed in the. ordinary sense, but produced
by the prosecution, now—
MR. WILLIAMS:

Extrajudicial statements, Mr. Chief

Justice?
Q

Made outside of court—

MR. WILLIAMS:

Extrajudicial.

40
Q

—-perhaps at a time when he was in custody or

perhaps not.
MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Yes, I understand.

At any rate, they are received in evidence.

They are on the record of the tape recording of the trial.
MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And in written transcript.

The jury then

acquits the defendant and at the conclusion then efforts sure
made, as are made here, to produc® them for broadcasting, for
tape recording, to juxtapose the admissions, tie confession,
against the jury's verdict.
MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Yes, sir.

Do you think that would be subject to being

broadcast?
MR. WILLIAMS:
reasons.

I think so, Your Honor, for these

Just as the written transcript of the trial would be

available for publication by newspapers, periodicals, and
publishers if they chose to use the transcript—and we.are all
familiar with many instances where transcripts have been used
as bases for books.
C

You clo not see any difference between the voice

and 'the printed wore.?
MR. WILLI AMI':
Justice.

I do see a difference, Mr. Chief

I think a fortiori the argument obtains that they

should be released if they are oral as distinguished from

41
visual exhibits for these reasons.

If you look at the

transcripts, the written transcripts of the exhibits which
ears in question here, you will see that they are laced with
the expression "uh~uh,” U-H-U-H.

Now, "uh-uh" can be "uh-uh,"

or it can be "uh-uh," or it c®n be "uh-uh?"
has a separate and distinct meaning.

And each of those

And I think when

representations are being made with respect to oral conversa­
tions held extrajudicially, the very best representation of
those oral conversations is not in a written document but in
an oral transcript.
And so I say, Mr. Chief Justice, that the argument
is a fortiori when we are dealing with conversations.
Q

Suppose after that, after the jury acquits this

person, the judge, as son® judges have been known to to,
excoriates the

jury, a matter which we know, in the code of

professional conduct is discouraged, if not forbidden.

Would

tha members of the jury have any bacis for stopping the
broadcasting of the. judge's denunciation?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think they would have no more basis

for stopping tha broadcasting, Your Honor, than for stopping
the publication.

And we are ail familiar with news stories

that have been written in recent years about judges remon­
strating with juries for their verdicts.

And I say once again,

Your Honor, that the same rights should obtain with respect to
reproduction of that orally.

Of course we have, as you know,

42
Mr. Chief Justice, rules throughout our federal system which
foreclose the right of access to the tape recordings of the
trial proceedings in all of our courts, and that applies also
to our appellate courts.
Q

What if after -then, in this hypothetical case,

the court having denounced and excoriated the jury which has
found the defendant not guilty and thereby discharging him,
the court then proceeds to denounce and excoriate the
defendant himself.

You would say than too that is available

for broadcasting?
MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

We have all had that experience,

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think it is a part of the proceeding.
It may be an unfortunate part of the proceeding.
part of the court record.

It becomes

It is in the written transcript

and therefore in the public domain.

And I suggest also,

absent the rule which forecloses access to the oral transcript
of the trial proceeding, that there should be

z.

right also to

broadcast such a~~
Q

What about the validity of that rule against

access to the oral recording?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think it is a good and salutary

rule at, the trial court level, Mr. Justice white, because I
think the search for truth :1s difficult enough.

When we look

at the fragility of a hum's powers of perception, the
fragility of their powers of recollection, the fragility of

43
their powers of expression, and then introduce their veracity,
it is difficult enough without putting him on stage and having
them conscious of the fact that every word that they utter in
a courtroom is being recorded.

I think that would be an

inhibiting factor.
Q

If Mr. Nixon had been a witness in this case

and had objected to having his testimony recorded and than
broadcast, you would say that if the court acceded to his
request and forbade publication, you would accept that?
MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Yes, yes.

MR. WILLIAMS:

There is such a rule existing now—

—so you would not have to make, that

But I think if there were not such a rule and he

said, "I d© not want to be recorded," I think he world loss
that just as if he said, "I do not want to have my words
taken down on the transcript."

I think he would lor:; that

because I think the court would say quits properly that we.
want to have a. check on tne a icuracy of the court re porter,
and we need it.
Q

But if the court said, "Mr. Nixcn, you do not

need to make that request because we have a court rule that we
do not turn loose any of pur oral recordings of our trials,"
you would accept that?
MR. WILLIAMS:
say, Mr. Justics White.

That is what I think the court would

44
Q

And you would accept that?

MR. WILLIAMS:

If I were counsel for Mr. Nixon,

won Id I—
Q

No, no, no.

If you war® counsel for the

broadcasters who would like to take the oral transcript and
broadcast it, the oral recording and broadcast it.
MR. WILLIAMSs

I would accept that for the reasons

that I have just-—
Q

Just yes.

MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Yes.

Just yes, you would accept it..
I have answered that, I think.

Yes, indeed.

MR. WILLIAMS:

I have answered -that because I believe

there is a different rule that obtains at the iarial level from
that which obtains at ths appellate level.
Q

What is the rule at the appellate level?

MR. WILLIAMS;

At the appellate level, my under­

standing is, Mr. Justice Brennan, that wa may not have access
to the oral arguments of this Court or any circuit court across
the land.

I do not think that is a salutary rule.

is a wrong rule, sir.

I think it

But I am realistic enough to recognise

that if I made that contention and lost, X would have nowhere
to go.

[Laughter]
Q

You might.

You might.

The Congress enacted a

statute saying that all such records of arguments here be made
public under the Freedom af Information Act..

We of course

45
might have further recourse to say then the recordings will
not h© mad©.

Is that so?

MR. WILLIAMS:

Oh, you could certainly do that, yes,

sir.
Q
to go.

Mr. Williams, you say you would have nowhere

What would b© your argument that we could not put

limitations ©n this—
MR. WILLIAMS:

I would argues, if 1 were put into

that position—which I an not, fortunately, today.

As I said

at the outset of this argument, I am not here assailing that
rule or any rule covering that subject..

But I certainly would

argue that the transcript of my argument today is a public
record of a judicial proceeding and that the public should
have access to my oral argument and that if they have access
to it, there is a concomitant right t© copy.

And tie concom­

itant right to copy gets constitutional dignity, in my view.
Q

And by copy you do not mean a-—

MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

—-written copy.

MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

Written.
You mean the precise, oral—

I do, Mr. Chief Justice, yes.

I think, Mr. Williams, a& will look forward

to how the taps; comas out with your several inflections on

U-H-U-H.
MR. WILLIAMSs
Q

Thunk you very much.

Hay l add to this par ad».; of horrible axamples

46
by putting one more to you?

Let us assume that instead of

having this case, we had a case in which there was a domestic
litigation between, let us say, a very high official in
government and a wife internationally known»

hot us assume

further that you had tapes of various lurid indiscretions.
Would you be making the same arguments for the availability
of those?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think, Mr. Justice Powell, that in

the exercise of the court's discretion it might refuse access
to those if they were pornographic in nature.
carved that out as an exception.

And I have

I think there are certain

•things where there are rights of privacy, where there are
rights of privilege—for example, Mr. Justice white talked
about the tapes that were not offered in evidence.
privileged.

So, we cannot claim those.

They art

They are presumptively

privileged under this Court in 1974.
0

Mr. Williams, may I come back to my example?

Where would the privilege be as between the parties to this
divorce 11tigaticn?
MR. WILLIAMS:
Mr. Justice Powell.

I would not say there is a privilege,

If the court in the exerci.se of its

discretion believed that the testimony which had been taken
in court constituted pornographic material, I think, it might
exercise its discretion to foreclose „

Q

But only if the court concluded that the

47
recordings anci the testimony constituted pornographic
material?
MR. WILLIAMS:

No, I think there are other situa­

tions where it. could exercise its discretion, Mr. Justice
Powell, to foreclose the right of distributing broadcast
material.
Q

Do you mean the super embarrassment of the

parties?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think in cases--to delineate them

specifically—I would think in cases where the prosecution
offered illegally obtained wire-tapped material to prove a
case against a wire tapper, where it offered hard core
pornographic material to prove that the defendant trafficked
in it.
Q

That is not what Mr. Justice Powell is asking

you about though.

He is asking you about material that is

actually admitted in evidence.
MR. WILLIAMSIt is admitted in evidence.

And from

the question he propounded, I assumed that be was talking
V

about materials that were pornographic in nature.
Q

And in a public trial?

MR. WILLIAMS.

And in a public 'trial.

And I suggest

to the Court that in. that instance the trial judge should
exercise his discretion to not inhibit access to it because
it is in a public trial.

It would have bean printed unless

48
he, excluded the press.
Q

And the reporters who heard it could not print

it?
MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

No, I did not say that.

You said a public trial.

MR. WILLIAMS:
Mr. Justice Marshall.

Mo, I said they could print it,
I think they can print it.

If I were

the trial judge, I would not put that inhibiting rule,
regardless of the e:nbarrasanont that flowed.

But it is a

consideration that a trial judge might take in the exercise
of his discretion.
in

And all that we are saying here­

Suppos® the recordings are laced with

expletives.
MR. WILLIAMS:

These are laced with expletives, ard

w© contend tirifc there is a right to irepect and copy them.
Q

And broadcast them?

MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

I think—

Expletives and all.

MR. WILLIAMS:

I do not think that w«s can get

constitutionally into what use is made of those records one®
they &r© released because we

run into countervailing First

Amendment considerations, and we are ' now dealing in a question
of taste rather than law.
Q
then -K

£■-.

You nr® net going to try to plead this decree

dsfor-oo to whatever use—any suits that mi ght arise

49
out of your subsequent use of the material.

This is just a

question whether you get access, not to your total right to use
it for whatever purpose you see fit.
MR, WILLIAMS:

It is a question, Mr. Justice

Rehnquisfc, of access, copying, and distribution; and whoever
distributes has to take the full risk of distribution and
whatever actions may be brought by any aggrieved parties.
Q

Mr. Williams, do you adhere to your answer that

you gave me earlier that embarrassment is never a valid
reason for denying access?
MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

I think it should not be a reason.

Unless it is pornographic.

You have to go

pretty far t© get something pornographic.
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think that what we are talking

about her© is material which, by the very—wher i use the
term "hard-core pornography," I am using really a description
of materia 1 which is contraband, namely, the very possession
of it.
Q

You would not 1st the judge even balance

embarrassment against other considerations.

Ycu would simply

say embarrassment of a witness or a third party is naver a
valid objection?
MR. WILLIAMS:

Mo, because I think whatever

embarrassment there may have been has already taken place in
the public trial and by the publication of the materials.

50

Q

You do not think there would be additional

embarrassment by the difference between the different kinds
of "uh-uhs" that you described?

I mean, after all, your whole

position is there is a material difference between reading and
hearing»

Can there not also be a material difference in the

terms of embarrassment as well as public interest?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think so.

I think that embarrass­

ment per se is not a sufficient basis for the denial of the
common-law right and the concomitant constitutional right that
flows from inspection.
Q

Does not. your position in part assume something

of this nature, that if a courtroom holds 130 people and 130
are entitled to hear everything that goes on—as they are—
that that means that there is some constitutional right of
13 million people to hear* it by way of the reproduction of
the recording?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that there

is a difference between extrajudicial recordings that are
offered as exhibits in a trial and the transcript of the
judicial proceedings per se.

And I have said that we are not

gainsaying the rule which inhibits the transcription of
judicial proceedings because there are countervailing
considerations, the inhibitions that witnesses feel when they
are talking for oral recordings.

I think there is a difference.

But we are dealing solely here, Mr. Chief Justice, with

extrajudicial recordings that were made exhibits in the court
below, that were played to the jury, that ware played to all
the persons who were in tdie courtroom, that were visually
transcribed, reproduced, sold as books, sold in 'the form of
periodicals and magazine pieces across the world.

That is

what we are dealing with here.
Q

Let me them return to Mr. Justice Powell's

hypothetical, and you have divorce proceedings between two
internationally prominent people, known all over the world,
and the man is a prominent political or other public figure,
and we reverse the roles that sometimes apparently occur and
we have the husband suing the wife for divorce on the grounds
of misconduct with respect, to her visits to some gentleman's
establishment, gentleman's apartment; <md unkown to her, all
of the conversations were recorded by this third party,
ungallant as that might be.
it and subpoenas them,,

And the husband finds cut. about

Now you have the subpoenaed material

brought into the courtroom, going one step beyond year
response to Mr. Justice Powell just now.

Now that is available

too for all the networks.
MR. WILLIAMS:

It is offered before the

jury? and

since it is a cause celebre, as described by Your Honor,
presumably it is offered to a packed courtroom and presumably
it is published by the press and by the periodicals covering
the trial so that ei the moment the recording is pli-yed, it is

52
in the public domain, the facts are in the public domain, and
it is now out, as it were.

Now we have the question as to

whether or not a member of the public can get access to the
exhibit in the form of an oral transcript, and w© contend yes,
that there is a right, a common-law right, to yet access and
then a concomitant constitutional right to reproduce after
getting access to that record»

I think the court cannot

concern itself at that time with what use is mads.

The

user would have to take Us risks thereinafter, whatever they
may be, for actions that might be brought against him by an
aggrieved party who would contend that he has a right, as
Mr. Justice Stevens has pointed out, a right not to be
embarrassed.
I do not know of any common-law right not to be
embarrassed by one's own inculpatory words.

Ar,d I think that

finally is the position that the petitioner is urging before
this Court today.
Q

The gentleman whose conversations I am mentioning

is not inculpated in any way.

He is somewhat guilty but a

third-party bystander so far as the trial is concerned.

His

voice and his conversations are—
MR. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Chief Justice,

I am constrained to say that sounds like a male chauvinist
remark, that he is not guilty.
Q

No.

No, he is not charged with anything.

53
. MR. WILLIAMS:
Q

1 thought he was—

No , he is a third party whose conversations

a.re being produced in litigation between a husband and a wife.
MR. WILLIAMS:

Uh-huh.

But then I gvess I have to

quarrel, Mr. Chief Justice, with your premise that he has no
guilt because I have to think him in equal guilt with the
defendant wife, and I would have to once again say that he has
no right not to be embarrassed by the sound of his inculpatory
words if that were transcribed.
Q

I do not like to prolong this unduly, but-—

[laughter] — let us change this, and it. is the husband, the
trial having been concluded and the matter having been
terminated.

It is the husband who does not wart to further

embarrass himself or his wife or anyone.
MR. WILLIAMS:

I suppose he had an option not to

bring the case on those grounds.
Q

It is a little late in my hypothetic*1 now of

course.
MR. WILLIAMS:
lata.

It is a little late.

It is a little

But 1 think that he has no standing, having brought the

case and having offered the evidence in a public trial, having
subpoenaed the transcript of the inculpatory words evidencing
inculpatory conduct, now to claim that he will be ©embarrassed
if it is further reproduced after it. has been offert d in open
court—

V

j

54

Q

The principle you are plugging for I suppose

would cover the situation where the words, the voices, or
whatever is said is rot inculpatory at all»
MR. WILLIAMS:

Oh, I think so, of course, a fortiori,

a fortiori, yes,
Q

So that it really is not the point here.

MR. WILLIAMS:

I do not thing it is.

I think

embarrassment is really not-—not th© point.
Q
but it might

The publication might be extremely embarrassing
not be?, inculpatory in the sense of being

criminal ©r indicating any guilt.

It is just embarrassing.

And your principle would cover it.
MR. WILLIAMS:

I believe it would, Mr. Justice

White.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. WILLIAMS:

Very well, Mr. Williams.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Jeffress, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. JEFFRESS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JEFFRESS:

If th© Court please:

To say that the injury that is involved here is ora
of embarrassment or one of mental anguish doss not, it seems
to n®, demean th® importance of the injury that will be
suffered.

We have plenty of insta:1:-cas in the law where

55
precisely such an injury is protected against.
the law of privacy.

Certainly in

Certainly in the statutes in sortie states

and court rules that provide for sealing the record in
juvenile proceedings.

That is what is involved in those cases,

preventing--call it embarrassment, call it mental anguish.
But the second thing is that we need to recognize that taoes
are different from transcripts.
have already been disclosed.

The transcripts of course

But tapes are susceptible to

uses that are far snore affensive to the people whose, voices
are captured on the tapes than are transcripts.

And, as we

have tried to point out» it is one thing to produce the tapes
pursuant to subpoena for use in a criminal trial, but the
effect of holding that there is a common-law right of the
public to obtain copies of those items that are; submitted
pursuant to subpoem is in essence to say that the effect of
a subpoena is not just to require production to the court and
the parties; but the effect of a subpoena is to require
production.
Q

Why is it that the Court did not restrict the

tapes in court, that he allowed them to be playad rather than
the transcript?

MR; JEFPRESSj

That is a necessary—

>

Q

Getting back to ray original discussion with

you, then not only the transcript was? released from privacy
but also the voices were; released from privacy, correct?

56
MR. JEFFRES3;

Yes, Your Honor, the Court felt that

that was an incident of a public trial that ought to be done.
Q

Could he not have ruled that; you did not need

it, you could bo satisfied with the. transcript'.’

But the Court

said you needed both; did not the Court say that?
MR. JEFFRESS:

1 am not aware of any order in which

he said that there was a constitutional reason--Q

The Court did say that these could be played

to th© audience and everybody in that courtroom.
MR. JEFFRESS;
Q

Yes, he did, and he provided—

He made it to that extent public.

MR. JEFFRESS;

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Marshall, but he did not rule at that time that, while the
tapes were going to be played in the courtroom and the trial
was going to be conducted as publicly as a trial can possibly
be, that once that trial was over there was any right of the
public, any interest in the public in obtaining copies of
those tapes to do with them whatever the public; pleased,
I would like fee mention one other thing.

As for

the Mar.ual for District Court Clerks, it has been our
position—and we think this is supported by the coot :;on-law
casos, the oases that establish the common-law right—that the
common-lav/ right is applicable to materials that arc- property
of the court.

It is said that the Manual for District Court-

Clerks provides that in cases of great historical importance

57
that exhibits are. to be retained by the clerk and are to
become a part of the clerk's permanent records.

But the

quotation that is relied on by Judge Gesell, by the Court, of
Appeals, and by the respondents is not the correct provision
of th© Manual for District. Court; Clerks.

The Manual in fact

recognizes that th® clerk, should not dispose of documentary
exhibits- not physically filed with the case—that is, in the
court jacket—and not claimed by parties to the case.
is item No. 10 in Chapter 13.

That

In the comment ho that it says

that case exhibits impounded by th® court or voluntarily
submitted as evidence normally remain the property of partias
to the case.

So. the Manual doss not stand for the proposition

that these are part of th© traditional court re.cords that are
subject to the common-law right of inspection.
And

p

cl £5

we have said, there is nothing in the

purpose of a subpoena, there is nothing in the function of e.
court, that justifies the court in so treating them.
Q

But does not the act that we had before us last,

spring affect at. least th© property of a claim that your client
might otherwise assert?
MR. JEFFRESS:

I believe the claim doss affect any

property right that he might assert.

But, as I have -tried to

say, there is no question here of title to the capas, no
argument that we make depends on the title.
Q

Are you distinguishing between property and

title?
MR. JEFFRESS:

One thing is clear? Mr. Justice—no,

I am not distinguishing between property and

title.

But I am

saying that one thing that is clear is that th * tapes are not
the property of the Court.

The tapes are in the custody of

th.® Court for a limited purpose.

Whether it is the Government

of th.® United states through GSA or Congress that should
decide whether to make these public or whether it is
Mr. Nixon himself that should decide whether to make these
public, the fact remains that it is not th© Court, which has
the tapes only for a limited purpose; and there is no commonlaw principle which would apply, regardless of ownership, and
say that these sorts of exhibits must be supplied to the
broadcasters and record companies.
Q

Have these tapes nor been delivered to the GSA,

pursuant to the opinions of some time ago, last year sometime?
MR. JEFFRESS;

Mr. Chief Justice, I must confess that

I do not know whether the underlying original recordings have
been delivered.
Q

The Court copies certainly have not.
Assuming for the moment that they were in the

possession of GSA and not of the clerk, would the GSA be a
necessary party to any effort, to reproduce them?
MR. JEFFRESS;

I certainly think th© Court: could not

grant effective relief if the GSA were not a necessary party.
But as the Court is aware and as explained in our reply brief,

59
the GSA originally took fell© position that no tape subject: to
that act would be copied and provided to the media and the
public.

That has gone backa and forth between GSA and

Congress in course of changing anc! resubmitting regulations .
And the current regulations? though still not final? appear
to, or may at least, leave that decision dependent on the
decision of this Court in this case.
Q

In other words, we are talking not just about

a housekeeping policy of the Court but GSA is going to make
its decision dependent on what the housekeeping policy of
the clerk's office of the District of Columbia la?
MR. JEFPRESS:

Odd as that may seem, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that appears to be what is in the latest proposed
regulations submitted by GSA to Congress.

It i.s provided

that the distribution or dissemination of the tapes wi.ll
depend on the ultimate relief granted in this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen..

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:25 o'clock a.m. the case was
submitted.3 -
