MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON., ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - CONTINUED
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The respondents challenge Washington's gross receipts
tax on stevedoring under both the commerce clause and the
import-export clause.

Both are relevant, as the stevedores

provide services for goods both to and from other states and
to and from other nations.
Since Complete Auto Transit last year, the rules as
to the validity under the commere clause are easy to state.
Labels attached to the tax are irrelevant.

The tax is not

invalid unless it discriminates against interstate or foreign
commetce, is improperly apportioned, is unrelated to any
services provided by the taxing state, or applies to business
to which the taxing state has no substantial nexus.

None of

these objections can be fairly applied to this tax.
The import-export clause, on the other hand, is both
more peremptory and more narrow, but a tax may run afoul of it
for reasons which would also invalidate it under the commerce
clause.

A non-discrminatory property tax against goods in

transit is an example which you used in Michel in Tire.

Such a

7
9

tax, of course, would also be improperly apportioned.

13
QUESTION:

Could a tax violate the export™import

clause without violating the ccmmere clause?
MR. GORTON:
Justice Rehnquist.

Precisely.

That is my next point,, Fir.

The peremptory ban of the import-export

clause itself, however, is directly only against imposts and
duties on imports or exports.
QUESTION:

Such an import —

But unlike the commerce clause, it is a

direct prohibition on the states?
MR. GORTON:

It is a direct prohibition and in that

sense it is much more peremptory and specific than is the
commerce clause.

Such an impost or duty is invalid even though

it meets all of the commerce clause tests, but in fact there are
relatively few such levies.
An example:

If the State of Washington imposed a

manufacturing tax on widgets and a compensating tax on widgets
imported from Japan, the latter tax might well meet all. of the
tests of the commerce clause, but it would still be an impost
or a duty on an import.
Another example is a tax on bills of lading, the
documentary evidence of goods in commerce, and thus a tax on
the goods themselves.
But Article I, section 10, does not apply to a tax
which is not an impost or cl duty on imports or exports.

In

Michel in Tire, you found the property tax there not to be an
impost or a duty even though the tires might still be imports.

14
This case,, we submit, is easier them Michelin Tire.
Not only is our tax not an impost or a duty, it is not on
imports or exports either.

Canton Railroad points cut that

the effect of the import-export clause is narrower as to
services related to imported goods than it is to the goods

J

themselves, and that, it does not extend to transportation
services consisting cf handling of goods at the port, which in­
exactly what the respondent stevedores do.
Our tax is on that local service only.

It ignores

both the goods aid their value, deals with a subject which no
other state can conceivably tax, arid is designed to defray the
fair share of the costs of government provided to those who
are engaged in the stevedoring service.

It ignores that large

class of imports and exports which do not require stevedoring
services; thus it does not impinge upon any of the purposes of
the export-export clause which you outlined in Michelin Tire.
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, in Michelin those

tires had come to rest.

Does that amount to anything in this

case?
MR. GORTON;
QUESTION;

It does not —

QUESTION:

So you don’t see that that has any sig­

nificance at all?
MR. GORTON:

— so I do not believe that that has

any significance here.
Yesterday, Mr. Justice Blackmun noticed respondents’
claim that Washington's gross receipts tax was not general
because it did not apply to every single business occupation in
the state.
general

Under re spondei its5 theory, no property tax is

because some property is always exempt.

The federal

income tax is not general .because seme categories of income
are exempt.
As a matter of fact, we would be hard pressed to find
under that theory a single general tax anywhere in the United
States.
QUESTION:

In that connection, General Gorton, is

any service industry in the State of Washington taxed at a rate
that is different from what is applied to stevedores?
MR. GORTON:
Blackmun.

Yes, railroads are higher, Mr. Justice

But most services, the great bulk of services are

taxed at this rate.
QUESTION:
stop.

I have one ether question and then I will

As I understand the state's power here, it was exercised

through a revenue ruling?
MR. GORTON:

Yes, but it is a .revenue ruling which is

totally consistent with the state

statute.

The only reason

16
that the state statute has not been applied to this activity
previously is your decision in Puget Sound Stevedoring, which
of course resulted in an injunction against our exercise of
that statute.
QUESTION:

And I take it, in any event, your opposi­

tion raises no question about the fact that it was applied by
a revenue ruling as distinguished from something else?
MR. GORTON:

I don’t believe that it does, but I

will have to leave that -QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

I didn't find it in the brief.
— for Mr. Piper.
Under your theory that coastal states,

whether East Coast, West Coast or Gulf Coast, would always have
some taxing advantages that: the inland states would net have,
I take it, simply by virtue: of the fact that stevedoring
activities are conducted in those states and not in other
states?
MR. GORTON:

If one concentrates, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, only, upon stevedoring services, I suppose some in­
land states would be able to do so.

QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
can tax coal mining.

Wyoming has coal mining.
That is exactly the answer.

Wyoming

California and Florida can tax the

17
production of oranges.

These in a sense are advantages to

those states because of their peculiar geographical nature, but
they don’t rise to constitutional significance.
QUESTION;

Except to the extent that the tollgate

mentality that your opponents mention and you criticized
yesterday, does seem to have been on the minds of the framers,
whereas the taxation of oranges and coal mines does not seem to
have been.
MR. GORTON:

Yes, but you have held as recently as

Michelin Tire that the mere fact that a no nd is criminatory
state tax which does not affect, which does not deal less
favorably with imports than it does with domestic goods, does
not violate the import-essport clause because it doesn't root
any of the purposes of the import-export clause.
In other words, the mere fact that a tax or a service
adds to the costs of goods or services in some other state, if
the tax is a fair one and fairly apportioned, is not a ground
for finding it to be invalid.
QUESTION:

Only the coastal states could impose a tax

on saltwater fishermen, which would presumably increase the cost
of fish in the interior states.
MR. GQRTGN:

Everywhere in the United States, but you

would not void that on constitutional grounds.
QUESTION:

Do the coastal states have some revenues

that the orange states might not have?

18
MR. GORTON:

Certainly.

In this case* the coastal

state has the burden of providing police services and fire
services and every other governmental service for stevedores.
The State of Wyoming has no such burden for stevedores.
QUESTION:

In a more concentrated way on the water

front*, in other words?
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

We have to protect our waterfront.

Wyoming has no waterfront which it has to protect.

We are

levying a nondiscriminatory tax against businesses on that
waterfront.
QUESTION:

You collect a sales or use tax on trans­

actions involving imports, imports that are delivered into the
State of Washington?
MR. GORTON:
Washington.

Only when they are sold in the State of

We cannot levy a sales tax against an item which

is sold in another state, whether it is an import or not.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Well, I suppose you levy use taxes?
We would not levy a use tax on an item

which is in the process of commerce, no.
QUESTION:

That is what I wanted to know, whether you
%

wou Id or not.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

No.
Well, don’t, you levy a use tax on goods

that bought over across the border in Oregon and brought back
into Washington?

19
MR. GORTON;
QUESTION;
MR.

Yes,,, we do.
How about imports?

GORTON;

Yes, I believe that we would tax an

import which came to rest in the State of Washington and was
being utilised by a resident of the State of Washington, but
not an import --- this would, of course, involve no burden on
people in other states.

We would not levy a sales or a use

tax against an import which was on its way to Idaho.
QUESTION;

You don't think Atlantic Richfield applies

the other way then?
MR. GORTON;

Atlantic Richfield, it seems to me,

first you spoke of taxes rather than imposts or duties ir.
Atlantic Richfield.

Secondly, Atlantic Richfield’s decision

does not need to be reversed or overruled in this case.
Atlantic Richfield —
QUESTION;
MR. GORTON;

Some other day?
I think not.

Atlantic Richfield’s tax

was invalid under your lone- line of decisions to the effect
that a sales tax can be levied only by the destination juris™
/

diction, which in that case: California was not, and your cur­
rent law has not threatened, by any means the holding of the
Atlantic Richfield case, and we do not. challenge it.
One final point which is raised by these respondents
is the implication that they are somehow politically powerless
outsiders in a marginal business.

Interstate and foreign

20

trade are vital to the economic health of the State of
Washington.

These private corporate respondents reside in and

do business exclusively in the state? and the Public Ports
Association respondent represents municipal corporations so
politically powerful that they have obtained a special state
constitutional exemption from property tax limitations applic­
able to every other governmental entity,, including the state
itself, save one.
In summary, Washington’s gross receipts tax here at
issue does not tax imports or exports at all.

In fact, a large

proportion of the imports and exports passing through the state
are not even affected by the tax because they do not require
stevedoring services.
The tax is levied on the handling of goods only and
not on the goods themselves.

Those services are performed

entirely' within the state a.:ad the tax is thus precisely appor­
tioned.

The tax does not discriminate against interstate or

foreign commerce and is fairly related to governmental services
provided by the state.
As Walter Hsllerstein says in his masterful Michigan
Law Review article of last June on Complete Auto Transit and
Michalin Tire, "In each case, this Court’s opinion can fairly
be read as stressing a common doctrinal themes

So long as the

state doss not discriminate against or impose buirdens upon the
constitutionally protected interests, the

1
tax will be

sustained."

21
Perhaps the sole serious aberrations from this theme
are Puget Sound Stevedoring and Carter £ Weekes.

We submit

that it is time to put then to rest.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Piper.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN T. PIPER, ESQ.,
IN BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PIPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The respondents are stevedoring companies of the
State of Washington and also the Washington Public Ports
Association, and to that extent and by their participation,
they have one segment of the public contesting with another.
5

The respondents, by the record, load and unload ships

between the first and last point of rest on the pier or dock
and the ship's hold.

We are here to defend, as you know, the

validity of two of your decisions, the Puget Sound case,
decided in 1937, the Carter & Weekes case, decided ten years
later, in 1947.

And we invoke two clauses of the Constitution

commonly called the import-export clause and the commerce
clause.
We see the clauses as different in force and effect.
Until this morning, it was our impression, from the briefs of
the state that they saw the clauses as imposing substantially
the same prohibitions on corn ere e, namely

your tax is okay

if it doesn't discriminate and if it apportions.

22
We hear today that the import-export clause does have
more force,

I must admit that I didn3t catch the exact point

on which it has more force.

But we will, of course, say that

it does and will try to be specific as to the additional force
we think it has over the implied prohibition of the commerce
clause.
We start therefore with what might be our best foot
forward, with the import-export clause, which does contain an
express prohibition.

Our thesis under the .import-expert

clause is this, that the express prohibition which in para­
phrase says that no state shall lay duties on imports and ex­
ports, does cover in a literal plain-meaning sense loading and
unloading because, we suggest, two reasons:

loading and

unloading is in a functional sense right at the heart of the
import-export process.
We also invoke we think a kind of approach suggested

by this Court in Michelin, where Michelin pointed out that the ■
tax there, a tax on the mass of goods and the property in the
state after they had come to rest, was avoidable by the
importer,

Wa say here that, on analysis we think anyone would

come to the conclusion that a tax fastened on the loading, on
the unloading would not be avoidable by the importer-exporter,
that if tie state were given power over that link in the
process, they
as a whole.

would have effectively power over the process

23
QUESTION;

How would you distinguish the statute in

one levied in terms of a charge on the use of the wharf or.the
dock by the -- on a publicly owned wharf or dock?
MR. PIPER;

The wharfage kind of case, cases like

that have been regarded as a kind of collateral, things that
seem to ba supplemental or an aid to the process, not integral
to it, have been treated traditionally as collateral.

I am

not sure that I would say that it couldn't have been decided
otherwise, but that is the law.
QUESTION;

Well? I am wondering how you distinguish

it from police and fire protection?

Certainly when you are

importing oil, you have a particularly high fire risk or at
least something even more volatile, the risk goes up.

How is

that fundamentally different for constitutional consfii^Hr-ional
purposes from police and fixe protection, in the routine case
of fire?
MR. PIPER;

As we read your cases, this Court seems

to have focused on the essential import process, bringing the
goods in, getting them sold, and the things that are peripheral,
in aid of, as a matter of first impression, perhaps they might
have been protected, but they haven't been.
QUESTION:

You can't bring them in without the

vehicle, can you?
MR. PIPER;

That's correct,

I think the only answer

I can give is that there has been a very bare bones kind of

2H
protection.

It has not included such things as wharfage,

cranes, renting cranes.

In the first stevedore case, for

example, among the actitivites that the stevedoring company
did was to make longshoreman available by hire.
protected, although it was in aid of process.

Tht was not
So it is kind

of a hardcore line, aid I cfuess what wa are saying here is that
even the strictest definition would, find the landing of the
goods essential to import, the loading of the goods essential
to the exporting.
There is a negative side to our thesis that we may
have to deal with also.

The state,

it seems to us on brief at

least, has attempted or suggested that they would graft onto
the clause a kind of implied limitation which would be to the
effect that it was — a tax is all right if it doesn’t di3criminate and it is apportioned.
reasons that I will state.

We would resist that for

We are not, of course, sure just

how strongly they feel about that limitation after this morn­
ing, but we will deal with it anyway.
Returning to why we feel that we are covered by the
express language, the language that is actually there in the
clause, I turn against to the functional ideas

If importing

is bringing things into the Country, what can be more central
to that than putting it on the land.
This Court, in Brown v. Maryland, in fact, expressly
said that a tax could be as effective to control imparting and

25
exporting if it attached at the instant of landing as if it
attached out at the entry of the harbor.

Going in the other

direction, what could be more central to getting the goods out
of the country, exporting, than getting them aboard the ship?
Another test, as I have suggested, came out of your
decision we think in Michelin.

There you pointed out that the

tax there could have been avoided by the importer just by
keeping the goods moving.

Nov?, the implication of that reason­

ing, it seems to us, is that if the function that is involved
here is so fundamental to the process that the importer cannot
avoid it, it is part of the process.

In other words, if you

give the state a power over this link in the chain, he has
power over the whole process.
The Brown v. Maryland case is instructive there.
That was the one that this Court relied on principally in
Michelin.

There the tax was a license to sell, and this Court

reasoned that without the ability to sell the product, the
act of importing was useless.

So that by fastening on the

ability to sell, they effectively taxed the process itself.
The Almy case, we!ve cited on brief, is another ex­
ample.

Ther s. there was a etax not on the importer but on the

carrier, or more precisely on the carrier's bill of lading, and
this Court took notice of the fact that a bill of lading is
really essential to commerce.

Therefore, if you fasten on

that bill of lading, you have fastened on the process itself.

26
In short, what we are saying is that we come under
the literall, express language of the clause as written, that
if you give the power, give the state the power to fax, this
link in the process, they can effectively tax the process.
Now, I come to wliat I won Id call our negative part
of our thesis under this clause, is there an implied limita­
tion in the clause that says in effect that no state shall lay
a duty on imports except that the state may do so if the tax
is unapporfioned and nondincriminatory.
The clause, as you know, has one express exception,
a state may tax in order to enforce or execute its inspection
laws.

But there is an imperative in that exception.

It says

it may tax to the extent absolutely necessary, so we are
faced then with just one exception that is express, and a
rather stringently restricted exception at that»

May you

graft on, should this Court-, graft onto the express clause an
implied limitation that a fax is okay if it is unapportioned
and nondiscriminatory.
Mow, despite counsel's statement this morning that
the import-export clause does have more force, we haven't in
our minds at least detected what force it would have beyond
approving taxes that are nond iscr iminat or y and apportioned.
Certainly, there is no suggestion in their brief as to just
why a tax would be struck down if it could meet those two
r equirements.

27
We give you three exceptions that v;e take to the idea
that there is some kind of limitation here in the nature of
taxes are okay if they are nond is criminatory and apportioned.
Your decision in Richfield has dealt with this question at length, very carefully taken into account the history
of the Constitution, the standards by which the Constitution
should ba expounded.

I am not going to repeat it because we

dealt with it at length in our own brief at pages 11 and 12.
I want to go as my second exception to the idea that
we can impliedly limit this clause to the purposes of the
clause.

Counsel yesterday stated correctly that this Court in

Michelin identified three purposes of the clause.

One of the

purposes we discussed on brief, which is the prevention of the
transit fee:

Michelin said that the clause was fashioned to

prevent transit fees, and the experience under the Articles of
Confederation had taught that the seaboard states were inclined
to fasten on these transit fees on goods flowing to the inland
states.
Throughout the decision in Michelin, there are re­
peated careful distinctions of the transit situation from the
tax on the mass of the property involved there.

For example,

the holding of this Court in Michelin, as stated, in the last
paragraph of the opinio», begins, "Petitioner's tires in thi.y
case were no longer in transit.'5
There is at page 290 of the Michelin opinion a

2b
statement or I think a very strong suggestion — I am going to
put it that way -- that even a nondiscriminatory property tax
might have to exclude or would have to exclude goods in transit.
So we think the transit idea has been carefully set aside and
preserved in the Michelin decision.
Now, the state wants to do exactly what that purpose
was intended to prevent.

They want, to have a transit fee.

Now, to be sure, it is a kind of sanitised transit fee, because
it is nondiscriminatory and. apportioned, but it is a transit
fee nonetheless.

It enlarges their tax bass by the increased

volume of traffic at the expense of the inland states.
I address myself now to the other two purposes that
you identified in Michelin that underly this clause.

We did

not address them as counsel correctly pointed out on brief, but
I do now.
The federal government wished to avoid having the
states share with it the revenues and the power of regulation
over foreign commerce, and we say that the state's brief
asserts the power to do exactly that.
a title,

They say at page 32,

in

state may, consistent with the Import-Export Clause,

impose a tax on the act or privilege of engaging in the business
of transporting goods moving in foreign commerce. "
Now, that business would include 'the business of the
foreign carriers themselves.

Stevedoring or the loading and

unloading is the issue here.

But the business of transporting

29
goods moving in foreign commerce, that is a business that the
foreign carriers are engaged in.
Suppose, for example, that they asserted that tax
and the foreign carriers, perhaps not being accustomed to that
kind of treatment, resisted, payment.

Zealous collection

officers presumably would take the most practical means of
collection, namely seising the ship.

That would have I think

some impact on foreign relations.
Again on the regulation point, if the power to tax
is the power to regulate, this Court has, as we have pointed
out on brief, previously said that our stata, which is a dairy
state, may tax oleomargarine — this is the 19309s — without
violating the rules against discrimination, which are veryloose, we say very feeble rules.

Well, why couldn't they if

they ware granted the power they ask here, to tax handling or
tax loading and unloading, why couldn’t they discriminate
between what is being unloaded and loaded, like discriminate
against oleo, against South American beef, why couldn't they,
in other words, use the power tc tax

loading and unloading to

wreck their own tariffs?
Now, this is speculation.

1 guess the point we would

say is that the speculation or the concerns expressed hero were
considered by the framerr of the Constitution, and it is not, we
suggest, appropriate for them to be second-guessed.
the

Those are

purposes that the framers thought merited this expressed

30
prohibition, and we suggest that they should be accepted and
the language should be applied as it was written.
Now, I come to the last reason why wa excepted the
idea that there is seme kind of implied limitation here, and
it comes back again to the idea that we think there surely
must be more force in an expressed clause -than in an implied
one, and therefore whatever you may decide is the rule in the
commerce clause, we of course assert that the commerce clause
has a stronger prohibition than the state does.
But whatever you may decided, surely there is some
additional strength cr force and effect in the import-export
clause than you would find in the commerce clause.
In connection with this question about the greater
force of the import-export clause, let me mention die Canton
Railroad case discussed by counsel yesterday as being the case
in which impliedly overruled the stevedoring cases,,

That was

a case written by Mr. Justice DOuglas,
Now, the language of that, opinion and its companion
did in fact consist of the word "handling.”

But if you look at

the facts carefully, "handling" covers things that are really
not loading and unloading.

It covered storage, wharfage,

weighing of loaded freight cars, furnishing a crane — these
are the peripheral sort of things, Mr. Chief Justice, that, as
I said, i:a tradition just Lave not received, 'the protection,
currently not being close enough to the core.

This was in fact

31
a distinction made in the first stevedore case.
Perhaps the closest thing to transportation there was
switching of cars frcra one point in Baltimore, that is from
the piers to the trunkline railroads.

Mr. Justice Douglas

said that was more remote than stevedoring and he distinguished
the stevedoring case.
Lest you think that that was a mere perfunctory
distinguishment that Mr. Justice Douglas made, I call your at­
tention to the fact that Mi.-. Justice Douglas participated in
the second stevedore case in 1946, just four years before
Canton, and there he voted to sustain the tax under the com­
merce clause.

But under the import-export clause, he switched

over to the majority and weis joined by one other Justice so
there was a 7-2 decision there, and he said to him the express
prohibiti 3D of the import-export clause made the difference.
And again it was Mr. Justice Douglas who wrote the Richfield
opinion, which said lack of discrimination is not enough to
save a tax that applies to import-exports.
I turn now to my argument on -QUESTION;

Just one observation there.

What he says

in Canton, because this is pretty close, he ends up his dis­
cussion by saying, "Hence, we. need not decide whether the
loading for export and unloading fcr import are immune from
tax by reason of the import-export clause," and cites Carter &
Weekes,-

when it would sea® that Carter & Weekes had already

32

decided it.

He said we need not decide whether or not to over­

rule Carter & Weekes.
MR. PIPER:

Isn’’fc that a fair reading of that?
Yes, I believe it is.

And if we had

nothing more to go on, I would say that it would be fair to
-=V

imply that perhaps he has some doubt in his mind because we
need not decide this sort of language, and that is why I call
your attention to the fact that just four years before he had
purposely switched his decision.
QUESTION:
MR. PIPER:
QUESTION:

p

He had been (ine of the two standards.
Yes.
One other question.

He draws the line,

they actually begin and end at the water’s edge, he uses that
language in the Canton case.

This activity actually goes

beyond the water's edge, doesn't it?

It goes into the hold of

the ship?
MR. PIPER:

It overlaps.

It is from point of rest,

the last point of rest into the ship, from hold of the ship
back to tie first point of rest.

That language is not precise

I think the distinction that he. makes of the distinguishing of
the stevedore cases, you just have to take as adding the pre­
cision that the language itself does not contain.
QUESTION:

And why is an income tax on a stevedore,

a state income on a stevedore, why would it be acceptable?
MR. PIPER:

I think traditionally, with some real

economic merit and force, this Court has regarded property

33
taxes, net income taxes as standing in somewhat better con­
stitutional grounds as far as movement in commerce is con­
cerned, because it tends to tax accumulated wealth and it
QUESTION:

Well, that may be but not for commerce.

But you say the clause you've got here, it has a deeper
bits.
MR. PIPER:

Your question would ba what would happen

if you attempted to —
QUESTION:

why is an income tax valid under this

clausa, even if it wouldn’t violate the commerce clause?
MR. PIPER:

I am actually tr-ing to recall whether

a decision has been made that says that an income tax is
j

valid.
QUESTION:

Well, whether a decision is made or not,

you are cutting new ground now or you don't want to cut new
•ground, why wouldn't a — what is your justification for
sustaining an income tax?
MR. PIPER:

I turn now to the commerce clause which as we have
said is an implied prohibition, therefore it is weaker.
leaves large areas

available for taxation.

It

For example,

under the commerce clause, the interstate sale itself is
taxable.

The state of the market may tax the production of

the goods, the manufacture or extraction of the goals is
.

taxable.
A good deal of transportation of interstate goods
is taxable.

Our thesis here is though that there remains and

should remain in the law an area of protection of

36
transportation, of movement in commerce, and I propose to
develop that thesis and draw the lines, referring to your
decisions by some illustrations.
Assume first, a journey from Alaska to Seattle,
unload©!, let's say, by stevedores, to a local carrier and
proceeding from Seattle to an inland city in Washington,
let’s say Walla Walla.

Your decision in Complete Auto

Transit permits a tax on the carrier that handles the
transit from the port of Seattle to Walla Walla.

That in

fact is not a new rule, it was an, old rule. The case of
Philadelphia Railroad v. Xnigb.t, which was distinguished in
the first stevedore case, involved a taxi service that the
)

interstate carrier had set up, and that taxi service was
considered local transit.

So that may be, that segment of

the carriage of the interstate goods may be taxed.
Going the other direction, Walla Walla to Seattle
and then to Alaska, your decision in Interstate Oil would
allow the local transit from Walla Walla to the port of
Seattle to be taxed,,

Now, we come to the area where we say

there should be some protection.
Assume a journey from Alaska through Washington to
\

an inland state, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois.

Washington,

under the stevedore line of cases cannot tax it.
QUESTION:
MR. PIPERs

With no stop in the state of Washington?
We will assume in this case that a

37
carrier from Alaska to Seattle, unloaded by stevedores, put
aboard an interstate railroad and continuing on through, we
would say no tax there, and we think that that not only
reconciles your decisions but we suggest that it makes good
economic sense, to emphasize the points or the rationale that
you have made in Complete Auto Transit.
We point out to you that if the tax on the in­
coming goods, say from Seattle to Walla Walla, if there is a
tax there, the people who are going to feel it are the con­
sumers in Walla Walla.

There is going to be operating the

normal political restraints against taxes.
Likewise, if the goods are going from Walla Walla
)

to Seattle, the people that are going to feel that tax are
the producers in Walla Walla whose goods become somewhat lose
competitive.

But on the through traffic, there really isn’t

any political restraint, and we have suggested, to you that
the rules that you have against discrimination just aren’t
quite enough.

They just allow too much latitude.

For example, our tax I should think could be In­
creased at least up to the railroads, which is 3.6 times
what they are now.
^

So we commend to the Court a considera-

tion of retaining what we think is a reconciliation of the
cases on their holdings to protect the through, transit, the
interstate carrier, which would include stevedoring on my
hypothetical, because you don't have the political restraints,

38
you have the transit fee syndrome.
QUESTIONS

Isn't that as a practical matter though

pretty much moot because your destination state is going to
impose a use tax and so they will be able to show that there
is in fact double taxation if Washington as well as, say,
Minnesota, the state of destination, taxes?
MR. PIPER:

Well, if excises of course can be

taxed upon any number of different acts.

Now, a use tax

would be imposed by the destination state, let’s say, on the
use by the consumer in that state, but it would not I think
■— I am suggesting that unless we are able to sustain the
authority that we are defending here, I think we need the

would invoke the use tax as a rationale.
QUESTION?

But isn't your typical tax that you are

opposing here, it is imposed on the privilege of doing busi­
ness and then measured at a certain percentage, isn't it?
MR. PIPER:

Yes», it is.

We say though that to the

extent that it fastens on to movement, which is a throughtype movement, it has been struck down and should be because
we sea no
^

again, we see the transit fee syndrome there.

We don't see the political restraints that yon have in the
destination state or in the origin state.
We have pointed out in our brief why we think that
the rule against discrimination just isn't enough of a

safeguard to protect against the transit fee syndrome.

NOW,

we, of course, recognise that the transit fee is a parpose of
the impart-export clause.

We suggest that the policy behind

the transit fee is worthy of consideration as you weight, as
you are allowed to do

under the commerce clause, the various

interests of the states for revenue and the interests of,
let's say, a common market.

We think that this protection

of through goods against a transit fee is a good common
market concept.
We in our state, for example, are making a distinc­
tion or we did make a distinction not long ago not only be­
tween butter and oleomargarine, but we tax billiards and
pool and golf but not bowling.

For a while there in our

state, if you rolled balls along the grass or along a felt
surface, you were taxable, but if you roll them on a wood
surface you were not.

Those distinctions ace permitted,

There is perfectly goal law.

The rules against discrimina­

tion give legislatures tremendous latitude, and they are
just not an adequate safeguard we think against the transit
fee syndrome.
Having said to you that we think the transit fee
syndrome is worth considering, as you are allowed to do under
the commerce clause, we return in summary to say under the
import-export clauso it has been considered, and the framers
said we don't want

it.

They have said we don't want the

That question is really not up for a reconsider"

It has been settled and there should be no implied

ORAL .ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Cour 1:
You asked Mr. Piper to distinguish the tax in
Canton Railroad from the one which the stata proposes to im­
pose hare, and the answer was simply that wharfage was
collateral or peripheral, I believe

were the words used.

There is no direct answer to the question.

The

services in Canton Railroad, and even more graphically in
Western Maryland Railway, which was a companion decision in
the early 1950's, were clearly beyond per adventure of doubt
taxes on transportation on the service of transportation,
, and they were upheld against charges that they violated the

)

import-export clause because, as we have already discuss®!,
while the import-export clause is peremptory and is an
absolute bar, it is a very narrow absolute bar.
Mr. Piper keeps speaking of its application to

41
taxes.

It does .not mention taxes.

It speaks of imposts or

duties on imports or exports.
QUESTION;

How about Brown v, Maryland,, there the

tax is on the sale, wasn’t it?
MR. GORTON;

There the tax was on the sale, and

there in the early days, before this Court used the commerce
clause and the built-up doctrines of discrimination and the
like, that tax was determined to be a tax against imports
because it was discriminatory.

The only sellers who had to

pay the tax in Brown v. Maryland were sellers of imports.
The competing seller of local goods was not charged with
those at all.

It taxed e..n import., in other words, as an

import, not as one of the goods that ware commonly located
in the state.

MR. GORTONs

a id n' t.
You, the Supreme Court of the United

States looked to the import-export clause and saM now this
clausa may have a great breadth when the tax is on the imports
or exports themselves.

At that time you might very well have

extended it as far as Michel in Tire.

In any event, you ex­

tended it until the imports were out of their original
packages, wherever they eventually left.

But even back in

the 1950's, when Canton Railroad, you said the clause is
much narrower when it is applied to services related to goods,
specifically in that case the handling services.

Those

handling services were an integral part of the transpor tation
of the goods, absolutely integral.

They could not — the

imports could not get into the United States without getting
off those chips, and without being transported to the trunk­
line railroads

and then in Western Maryland transported by

the railroads.

They couldn't have done it at all? nonethe­
