MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76”5344* Moore against Illinois,
Mr, Hughes, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK J, HUGHES, JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, HUGHES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Petitioner here is challenging the validity of
his Illinois rape conviction, a conviction -- based on the eye­
witness identification testimony of the one and only eyewitness
to the crime.

The victim, who is a white woman was sleeping

in a darkened room when she was awakened by a noise.

She then

had, at most, a ten to fifteen second opportunity to observe
the face and the figure of her masked black assailant,
sorry, unmasked black assailant.

I am

Subsequently, he was masked,

during the course of the commission of the crime *— a conviction
for which the Petitioner is presently serving a 30 to 50-year
sentence of imprisonment.
The crime occurred on December 14, 1967.

In the

week after the crime occurred, this witness had two opportuni­
ties to view various photographs, but made no identification of
anyone from those photographs.

Seven days after the assault,

without any showing of exigent circumstances, without any
showing of necessity, the police brought this sole eyewitness

4
to a courtroom where the Petitioner was scheduled to appear
charged with the crime that was committed upon her.

The witness

was brought to that courtroom specifically for the purpose of
making an identification.

That identification proceeding was

to be her first opportunity to view any person since the date
of the crime, since the time of the assault.
suspect prior to that time.

She had viewed no

When she arrived at that courtroom,

over her objection and before she viewed the suspect, she was
asked to sign the formal charge that had already been placed,
against the Petitioner in that courtroom.

She was then placed

in that courtroom to wait,and while she was waiting there she
saw other cases.

In the course of seeing those cases, as the

defendant's name in those cases was called, the defendants were
brought out from the lockup.

The defendants in custody were

brought out from the lockup, and she observed that happening
for some period of time before the Petionercs case was called.
The Petitioner's name was then called, a name she recognized
because she had seen it on the complaint that the police had
asked her to sign a few minutes earlier, a complaint she didn't
want to sign without making identification but which nonetheless
at their urging she did.

The Petitioner was then brought out

from the lockup and stood before the bench, before the judge.
The Complainant, the sole eyewitness, was then asked by the
clerk —* her name was called by the clerk and she was aksed to
come up.

She was brought up to stand seven or eight feet from

5
the place where the defendant., Petitioner, was standing, in
front of that same judge«

At the time that the Petitioner

stood there, not only was he an indigent without counsel but
in violation of an Illinois statute which specifically required
that the judge advise him of his right to have counsel, he was
not so advised.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hughes, the Appendix at page 43 and

44 has an apparent transcript of that proceeding.

Is that the

entire proceeding?
MR» HUGHES:

No, sir.

I believe that you will find

that the entire proceeding is reported on pages 48 and 49 of the
Appendix.
QUESTION:
MR» HUGHES:

So this is just an excerpt.
Yes, sir.

The entire proceeding is

found at pages 48 and 49«
The witness then — this sole eyewitness then
heard the prosecutor tell the judge that certain items taken
from her home at the time of the assault, at the time the crime
had been committed upon her, were recovered from the Petitioner's
apartment when he was arrested»
true.

That statement was wholly un­

The prosecutor's next statement was that the clothing her

assailant wore was recovered from the Petitioner's apartment
when he was arrested.

None of that clothing was ever intro­

duced in evidence in the course of the trial of this case.
These statements were then Immediately followed by the

6
prosecutor asking the witness to identify the Petitioner as her
assailant, which she did.
The critical nature of this proceeding in this case,
the identification procedure in this case, is emphasized by
what we believe is the lack of other reliable evidence.,

For

example, at the tine, subsequent to the assault, the Complainant
victim advised the police to look on a file box that was in the
apartment for fingerprints,
print.

They did, in fact, find a finger­

The compared that fingerprint with that of the

Petitioner and it was not his.

The clothing, certain clothing was

taken from him. at she time of his arrest, and that clothing in­
cluded a pair of trousers.

The fly area as well as the rest of

that area was tested by a Chicago Police department lab tech­
nician* and that technician testified that he found no semen,
no female cells, no matching hairs or fibers and no blood in
the trousers, even though at the time of the assault
examination by a doctor a few hours later disclosed that she
was menstruating,
Our major contentions are first, that this indigent
Petitioner had an absolute right to counsel at that initial
court proceeding.

At least the State, we believe, concedes in

its brief that he had a right to counsel at that proceeding,
QUESTION:

Do you think your first contention was

treated by the Supreme Court of Illinois in its opinion?
MR, HUGHES:

No, we don't think that it was treated.

7
sir.
QUESTION:

Was it ever treated in any other State

court proceeding?
MR» HUC-HES:
two»

It was not treated»

There were only

There was the trial and then the appeal in the Illinois

Supreme Court»
QUESTION:

And it wasn't treated in either of those

proceedings?
MR. HUGHES:

No»- Well* the defense lawyer raised it

during the motion to suppress the trial and in his argument as
grounds for his alleged* his argument that the lineup-was so
I mean the showup was so suggestive that it violated the
principles of Wade* Gilbert and Stovall»

It was alleged in

that sense»
QUESTION:

Was it pursued in the Supreme Court of

Illinois?
MR, HUGHES:

It was not pursued* as such* in the

Supreme Court of Illinois* in terms of right to counsel,
QUESTION:

What do you do about the exhaustion

requirement of habeas?
MR, HUGHES:

We are -- Clearly the issue of violation

of Wade.* Stovall arid; Gilbert was raised in the Illinois Supreme
Court,

The suggest-ivity of right to counsel was raised — I

mean the suggestivity of the confrontation was raised.

As a

matter of fact* during the trial of the proceedings* as I said*

8
in the State court, the issue of.absence of right *— lack of
right to counsel was brought out by the defense lawyer»

When

the ease got to the federal district court, it got there be­
cause Petitioner filed his pro se habeas corpus petition, and
in that petition he alleged suggestiveness.

He alleged that

the showup was conducted in violation of the principles of Wade,
Gilbert and Stovall, and he also alleged that the conviction
was tainted by the prosecution{s untrue statements which were
not available to his counsel at the-time because his counsel
was denied a transcript of that initial court proceeding.

The

district judge dismissed the case on,the grounds he had not
exhausted his State remedies and not filed an Illinois post­
conviction proceeding petition.

The Seventh Circuit said:

"We believe that the Petitioner has made sufficient allegations
to make it clear that he is now entitled to have a hearing in
the district court" or at least a decision in the district
court with respect to all the events which led up to his con­
viction in terms of the ideas of suggestibility -»■» the ideas of
violation of Wade, Gilbert and Stovall.
QUESTION:

Prior to this courtroom episode, there

had been at Least two, I guess there were two opportunities for
her or exhibits to her of various photographs, were there not?
MR. HUGHES :
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES:

Yes .
And what happened at those?
The first one was a group of about two

9
hundred from which she selected people who had general physical
characteristics of the person that she described as her assail­
ant»

It was not intended to pick out any person and she

clearly did not.
QUESTION:
MR, HUGHES:

What was its purpose?
The purpose,, apparently, was to narrow

down as much as possible the number of possible suspects.
QUESTION:

But it did not have as its purpose any

effort for her to Identify her assailant?
MR» HUGHES:

Well, I presume that one of the

police’s interests was to have her make an identification if
possible, but it was clear in her mind, and I think clear in
the detectives'.1 testimony because they testified at the
hearing on the motion to suppress the identification at trial
that essentially that viewing was of a large number.

It was

almost; like the police folder book which in some jurisdictions
is kept in the police station.
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES:

It was a, mug-shot book.

Some 200 pictures.
Some 200, probably 200 different people,

yes, sir, although the record doesn't Indicate.
QUESTION:
MR, HUGHES:

And then the second one?
And the second one she was shovm

approximately between 9 and 12»
would indicate that there were 9.

The record, I think, would
At that time, I think, the

record makes it clear that she never identified any one person.

10

Ohe did pick out 3 which she said had similar physical char­
acteristics to her assailant.
ultimately was,

But, I think, her testimony

"I did not make an identification of any

person from a photograph."
QUESTION:
included?

Was his -- Was Petitioner's photograph

In the 200 or in the smaller number 9 to 12?
MR# HUGHES:

The police detective Investigating .the

case said that it was so included.
i
' QUESTION: In both?
MR. HUGHES:

However --

Only in the subsequent, as far as we

know, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHEo:

In the 9 to 12.
Yes.

However, we don: t know which 9 to 12 were shown to
her because the police department didn't mark them in any way
at the time they were shown.

So, when the hearing on the

motion to suppress, identification came up in the trial court,
the detective said, "To the best of my recollection, I am
pretty sure. I'm reasonably sure that some of these" or 'these
are the photographs that were shown to her when we showed her
QUESTION:

What you are saying, I gather, is that

his photograph was in that -- among that smaller number and
that she die not pick out that picture as her assailant.
MR. HUGHES:
so

She picked out three of the nine, or

11

QUESTION:
MR. HUGHEia:
CUEGTIQN:

Was his one of the three?
His was one of the three.
There seems to be some difference in

understanding as to whether of those 9 to 12 photos there was
only one picture of a person with a beard.

You say somewhere

in your brief that only the picture of the Petitioner depicted
a person with a beard, and on page 5 of the Respondent's brief,
they said "Mine to 12 photos all of which were male Negroes,
several of whom were bearded.'1

Now that is a matter of fact,

but you apparently differ as to what the facts were.
MR. HUGESiS:

I believe «— although we can't be sure

\\/hich ones she was shown because the detectives weren't sure.
The detectives were reasonably sure that she had seen three of
those before.

The other six they weren't sure.

sure which ones she had seen before.

She was not

As a matter of fact, she

was not even sure that the one that was shown her at the time
of the hearing on the motion to suppress, the one that did in
fact have the Petitioner's picture on it, she wasn't certain
whether or rot that was the photograph she had been shown by
the detectives previously in the police station during that
week.

It is possible that one or more of those twelve had

beards.

Of the three that she picked out, persons having

similar characteristics, narrowed it down to three as having
similar characteristics, without saying any of those three were
the one.

12

QUESTION:

You say three and again in Respondent’s

brief they say one or two,
MR, HUGHES:

On page 5 of the brief,

Well, my best recollection of the

record is that of those nine, or so, perhaps, one or more had
some facial hair.

We don't know.

'QUESTION:

Perhaps one or more.

She picked out one or two, is what's said

on page 5, referring to the record at page 232.
MR. HUGHES:

If you read the record, including her

testimony, both at the hearing on the motion to suppress and
during the trial and finally including a portion of the
testimony in redirect examination by the state’s Attorney,
she makes it clear she was not identifying any person when she
picked out those three photographs.
QUESTION:
it says one or two.

Now, you say three, and, as I say, here
Now, again, it is helpful to us if you

can get together, at least, on the facts,
MR, HUGHES:

I believe that of the nine she saw at

the second viewing she did, in fact, state that she picked out
three of those nine as having similar physical —
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES:
a beard,

As resembling her assailant,
That's correct.

Only one of which had

The other two did not,
QUESTION:

Mr, Hughes, admitting that her testimony

was confused and the State's testimony was confused, the
record isn't confused, is it?

Now, what does the record show?

13
Does the record show that the three had beards or one had a
beard or none had beards or two had beards?
MR. HUGHES:

The record shows of the three that she

picked out as being persons of similar physical characteristics
one of those three had a beard.
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES :
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES :
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES :

And that was whom?
That was this Petitioner.
That was him.
Yes, sir.
And that the others did not have beards.
The other two did not have beards,

that's correct* sir.
QUESTION:

What about Wasilewski”s testimony at

88 of the Appendix, "She selected the photograph."
gather* , was the examination of . the nine .,

This, X

"she selected the

photograph of the defendant as being the man who had attacked
her.

She also selected one more vjith the same physical

characteristics of the man."
MR. HUGHES:

That was his testimony.

Her testimony

is to the contrary. Your Honor,
QUESTION:
now?

How many courts have reviewed this case

Two state courts and two federal courts?
MR. HUGHES :

Two state courts and two federal courts,

yes.
QUESTION:

And they found any errors that occurred

24
in the trial to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, is
that correct?
MR, HUGHJ2B:

Well, the record that they based it on

was che record that we are here arguing has constitutional
significance ox the issues»

In other words, we don51 think

their finding of fact is necessarily entitled to any more or
less — They didnec make any findings of fact, let me put it
that way»

The record —- The district court made its findings

based on the record, the same record that was available to the
Illinois Supreme Court,
QUESTION;

On the day of the trial, in the courtroom,

did she identify this defendant, the Appellant here, as the
attacker?
MR, HUGHES;

In the course of the trial before the

jury she did so identify him, yes, Your Honors

But I would

like to talk about that with respect to my second and third
points.

As I said, we believe that at that proceeding, as far

as Point Number 2 is concerned, that initial formal criminal
judicial proceedings had in fact been instituted, and under
United States and Gi lb e rt v „ Ca 1 If orn la . that
our.Petitioner was entitled to counsel at that initial
court proceeding.
QUESTION:
MR, HUGHEh:
their brief does.

You say the state concedes that point,
We believe they have,

I am not sure

QUESTION:

Is part of your contention that, assuming

that you did have a right to counsel, that the in-court testi­
mony about the out of court pretrial identification was per se
excludable.
MR. HUGH-2?:
QUESTION:

We believe that that's righto
Let's assume that that testimony about the

out of court identification was automatically excludable, with­
out showing any taint or any undue suggestivenessP just the
fact that there was no counsel*

Assume that there has been no

finding of harmless error in this case, with respect to that
evidence.

If there is a finding of harmless error, 1 would

like to know*
MR, HUGHES:
evidence.

Not specifically with respect to that

There has not been.

And that evidence, the evidence

of that confrontation, in fact, went into evidence in the
State's case in chief.

The identification elicited was not

merely, "Miss Witness, do you see the person in court that
committed the crime upon you,’1 or words to that effect.

But

the state also in its direct examination of the witness dwelled
at length upon this initial in-court confrontation and identi­
fication.
QUESTION:

Your basic claim is that this is simply

a violation of the Un.11ed . ? fc ates _y. Wade, isn't it?
MR. HUGHES:

That's one of our claims, but we would

say independently of that. Your Honor, independently of that

16

when we are talking about identification, eyewitness identifi­
cation, the lynch pin, I think this Court called it, of that
is its reliability»
QUESTION:

Isn't the rule of United states v. Wade

a per se rule?
MR* HUGHES:
QUESTION:

Yes, we believe that it is.

Yes, sir.

And if there was a violation of that

doctrine here, that's the end of it unless Wade is going to be
re-examined, isn't that right?
MR* HUGHES:

We think that is so because the right

to counsel is such an integral part of the fact-finding process.
QUESTION:

And if you say that the criminal proceed­

ings had begun against this person —■
MR* HUGHES:

We suggest there is just no doubt or

question about it.
QUESTION:

— so that under the Kirby qualification

or clarification of Wade, it violates the rule of United
Statesj/_. Wadea
MR» HUGHES:
that's clear.

That's correct, Your Honor*

Vie think

Although Kirby uses the word ’’indictment," we

think clearly —»
QUESTION:
MR. HUGHES:
QUESTION:
of other words.

The initiation of criminal proceedings.
That's right.
Uses the word "indictment" among a series

MR, HUGHES:

Thafc ?s our position

If 1 just may get back a little bit to the concept of
reliability, because that's what we are talking about in iden­
tification,

I think the thing this Court should keep in mind

is that defense counsel never knew about those suggestions,
QUESTION:

As regards the right to counsel, it is

irrelevant whether it — insofar as the in-cou.rt testimony
about the out of court identification is concerned, reliability
is irrelevant, isn't it?
MB., HUGHES:
QUESTION:
MR, HUGHES:

We think so.

Yes, sir.

Well, isn’t that what Gilbert held?
We think that’s what Gilbert held, yes,

sir,
QUESTION:
MRo HUGHES:
QUESTION:

Wade and/or Gilbert?
Yes, sir,
Mr, Hughes, may I come back to an issue

of fact that was suggested by a statement I think you made to
the effect that the missing musical instruments were not
found in defendant's quarters.
MR, HUGHES:
QUESTION:

Were they ever accounted for?

As far as we know;, no, sir,
There was no evidence with respect to

where they were?
MR, HUGHES:

No, sir.

They were never found, as far

as we know.
QUESTION:

Any explanation of the statement made at

18
preliminary hearing that they had been found in defendant's
apartment?
MR„ HUGHES:

In the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,

the Assistant State's Attorney who made those statements said
in substance in an affidavit which apparently the court con­
sidered in terms of arriving at its decision and its opinion,
that if the statements were untrue they were not made with
knowledge of their falsity and that if he made them, that at
the time he made them he made them thinking they were true*
Because apparently what happened was very simply they recovered
two musical instruments from the Petitioner at the time of his
arrest, a guitar and a flute.

It happened that the victim o.f

the crime had a guitar and a flute taken from her, but they
were lot the same items»
QUESTION:

They both just happened to be music

lovers,
MR.* HUGH B :

They both happened to possess musical

instruments, yes, sir»
QUESTION:

Xn any event, that statement to which

my brother Powell referred was not in any way brought to the
attention of the triers of the fact on the trial of his
innocense or guilt, was it?
MR, HUGHES:

No, sir, it was not brought to the

attention of the triers
QUESTION:

So what relevance does it have?

I mean

19
what bearing does it have?
MR. HUGHES:

Our position was that it has a great

bearing on the reliability, because the triers of the fact
are the ones who determine reliability.
QUESTION:
this statement.

Yes, but they didn’t know anything about

You just told me.

MR, HUGH .hi:

Right.

And, therefore, they could not

calculate into their evaluation of the witness 8 reliability
the very suggestive and impressive confrontation which was
never brought to their attention, as it was never brought to
the attention of the trial judge during the hearing on the
motion to suppress.

And it wasn’t brought to their attention

because the defense lawyer had been denied the transcript,
and so he didn’t know those statements had been made, and he
at no time was able to plumb into, to bring to the attention
of the trial judge or the jury their suggestibility, to ask
the witness whether or net they, in fact, had affected her
ability to make a fair eyewitness identification.
QUESTION:

At the time of this courtroom confronta­

tion, as you call it, what was the status of the criminal
proceedings against your client?
MR, HUGHES:
9/10*a percent

formal term for that.

It is the first time a person is brought

In Illinois, if you are arrested, and cannot make

bail,because in a felony case bail is almost always set unless
you are arrested within a few hours of the court time, you are

you sometime in the future,
QUESTION:

the judge and it was at that time that this confrontation took

MR. HUGHES :
QUESTION:

And the purpose of that proceeding was what,

to find whether or not there, was probable cause to bind him

Is there anything in the record to show

who arrested him and why?
MR, HUGHES:

tied him into —
QUESTION:

Who signed — You mean you can pick up a

MR. HUGHEc :
QUESTION:

It is unclear whether or not
Is that normal in Illinois, you can just

MR* HUGHES:

It is hot normal.

There is some

question as to whether in this case an arrest warrant was
issued by a judge.

The State's Attorney said there was.

Attorney’s office, the record is bare in that regard,,
QUESTION:

Didn’t they find some letter or address

book, or something?
MR. HUGHES:
QUESTION:

They found a letter, yes, sir,
You don’t claim that there wasn’t probable

cause to arrest him, do you?
MR. HUGHEo:
QUESTION:

I don’t think it is an issue.
That’s not an issue here.

MR. HUGHEo:

I don't think it’s an issue.

I don't

think we have to admit or deny it.
QUESTION:

Don't you think it is a matter of interest

as to how this man ended up in custody?

I am interested, if

nobody else is.
MR. HUGHEo:
QUEoTION:

Well, Your Honor ~
I want to know why this man was in custody.

The woman had not signed the complaint, and she had refused to
sign it, and yet he. is in custody and I would like to know
why.

If you don’t

know It i!s ■ all- right, but •»

MR. HUGH-1.0 :

We tried to find out, Your Honor, when

we got in the case because we didn’t represent him at the
trial, and we subpoenaed all the records and there were no
records available of any arrest warrant issued for him and we
had sketchy excerpts from the police reports.

The rest of the

materials, police documents, had already been destroyed and a
search by the clerk's office, pursuant to subpoena, came up with

23

no arrest warrant,
QUESTION:

I find difficulty focusing or finding a

focus on this matter of the address book,

Can you shed some

light on that?
MR, HUGHES;

At the trial, there was- admitted .-w.

into evidence a checkbook-like document, a checkbook, I guess,
would be the best description of it, although apparently it
didn't have any checks in it.
QUESTION:
MR, HUGHEE:

Pocket checkbook type?
I would think it would be the size like

most people carry who carry checks.

In that book, was a

That book was found

The police tracked — when

she got *»“ after the assault, she went to pick up that book
thinking it was hers, anc! when she looked in she expected to
find $60, or she thought perhaps the assailant had taken her
$60. . dhe looked at it, saw the letter and determined it was
not her checkbook, so she turned that checkbook over to the
police.

The police, in turn, contacted, apparently, the woman

whose letter it was and had made some association between that
woman and the Petitioner.

And that's how they came to arrest

the Petitioner, I believe, but I am not sure because the record
doesn : t contain all of the issues with respect to probable
cause.
QUESTION:

What was the linkage between that book

24
and Moore, the Petitioner here?
MR, HUGHES:

Mr0 Moore — The woman who wrote the

letter had been his girlfriend up until a day or so before the
alleged rape.
QUESTION:

There is some reference in the briefs, if

not in the record, that on the following day, or shortly after
\

the attack, he went to the bar inquiring about the existence »“
whether that checkbook had been found in the bar.

Is that

correct?
MR, HUGHEs;
QUESTION:

That Ss correct „

Yes, sir.

Is that not some linkage between him and

his possible presence in that room that night?
MR, HUGHES:
things:

I think it may be, Your Honor, but two

Number one —
QUESTION:

Put it this way;

Eo, you think

the jury hearing that could reasonably infer that he had been
in that room, at some time and had dropped that checkbook?
MR. HUGHES:

The jury could infer that, but if I just

may recite the evidence..

The Petitioner introduced evidence

indicating he had lost that book the night before in a bar,
a bar where he had concededly. met and talked briefly with the
victim in this case.

Vihen she woke up — i mean, sorry, not

woke up, after the assault when she went to pick it up she
thought it was hers.

Sh? might well have picked it up that

night he lost it and brought it home thinking it was hers.

25
QUESTION:

VJe are confronted now with what the jury

would reasonably have had a right to believe„

Would the jury

— I think you indicated the jury would have a right to infer
from that evidence that if his property was found in the room
of the victim, that perhaps he, too, had been there.

Would

they have a right to assume that?
MR, HUGH-do :

Certainly, they would have a right to

assume that, but I think. Your Honor, again when we are
talking about reliability we are not talking about it in terms
of either corroborating evidence in order to determine whether
somebody committed a crime.

Reliability of an identification

means the circumstances surrounding the identification, and
that's all,

For example, the same way as right to counsel

does not mean even when the evidence is overwhelming that we
can convict them, without a lawyer if they don't intelligently
waive the right to a lawyer.

And I think the same analogy

applies.
QU;i>TIGN:

Mr. Hughes, before you sit down; Your

brief and your opponent's brief were both filed before our
decision las t spring in Mans on v. BrathwSy. .

mo you think that

case has any bearing on this one?
MRe HUGHho;

I think ours is a right to counsel and

that is suggestive confrontation only, due process, Fourteenth
Amendment.

X think they are different.
QU2STION:

Tha t * s y ou r ex p la na t ion ?

26
MR * HUGHE.- :

Yes, sir.

But even if it did. we think

in the record in this case we would still survive any examina­
tion in light of the factors in Mans on.
Thank you.
MIR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levad.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLEo H. LEVAD, ESQ.,
FOR THE RES PONE ENT
MIR. LEVA!):

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
If I may, I’d like to address myself initially to
soma of the factual allegations that were made by Mr. Hughes*
and maybe I can clear up some of the factual problems that are
in the record at this point.
First of all, with regard to the purpose of the
hearing that was held on December 21, 1967, I think it appears
from the record and under Illinois law the first time an in­
dividual appears before the court is for a setting of bond.
As a matter of fact, that is what happened in this case.
QUESTION:

Why is he there at aX12

arrested as a result of what?

He has been

Aftd a complaint has been filed

against him?
MR. LEVAD:

Complaint was filed prior to this hearing*

yes. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Or does this happen just if he'd been

arrested, even if no complaint had been filed?

27

MRo L-VAE :

It happens even if no complaint has been

filed.
QUESTION:

Anybody who has been arrested is brought

before the court rather promptly and the purpose is to set
b ond ?
MR, LEVAE:

The purpose is to set bond.

On a

complaint filed prior to the arrest, tentative bond is set,
but he is still brought before the court for bond hearing»
QUESTION:

But this complaint was not filed before

a

cO

MR. LEVA-:

Apparently, it was not. Your Honor.
Apparently?

The record shows that it was

MX?« I *EVA.: - :

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.

I am

s orry,
QUESTION:

Well, why was he arrested?

Stick to the

record, if you can»
MR* LEVAD:

I will, Your Honor»

I can, Your Honor,

to the best of my ability»
.1 donf,t think it is entirely clear from, the record
as to whether there was an arrest warrant or not, but I think
the record does indicate that there was probable cause for the
arrest, whether there was a warrant at that time or not»

Prior

to the arrest, the police detectives had the letter which was
explained by Mr» Hughes and, if I may amplify on that a little

28
bit:

It was stipulated at trial that the suspect. Mr. Moore,

had obtained that letter from the girl's apartment, and I think
and it appeared on Miss Miller's floor immediately after the
rape»

I think the jury and the police officers — the jury

later and the police officers at that time could infer and use
that as a basis for probable cause for the arrest.
QUESTION:

I am not being critical, but on that basis,

you. say it is unimportant as to who did actually make the
arrest.
MR. LEVAD:

I am not saying it is unimportant, Your

Honor,
QUESTION:
MR. LEVAD:
QUESTION:
MR. IjEVAI) :

It is not an issue in this case.
It is not an issue in this case.
Right.
The probable cause for the arrest has

never been challenged below in the state court or in the federal
court.
QUESTION:

MR. LllVAL :
QUESTION:

And it is not an issue here.
That is correct.
Getting her to sign the complaint after he

was arrested was just an abundance of »=■
MR. LEVAR:

No, it was necessary to file a complaint

anyway.
QUESTION:

Oh, it was?

they had tc file the complaint?

Under Illinois law at sometime

29
ME, LLVAD:

Yes, Your Honor,

And when an arrest is

made prior to filing complaint, Illinois lax? requires that it
be filed as fast as possible,
QUESTION:

Sometimes, I suppose, it is filed by the

police, by the arresting officer, isn't it?
MRo LEVAD:

Yes, it is,

I might address rnyself to the issue of whether there
were other individuals — strike that — The photo identi­
fication that was made and which Mr, Hughes discussed, I
maintain, was an Identification prior to this bond hearing.
The record indicates primarily during the motion to suppress
that Miss Miller indicated that she did identify one individual
from the nine that were shown her.

That testimony is op page

155 of the record,
QUESTION:

Do you happen to know if it is in the

Appendix?
MR, LEVAD:

Yes, it is-, Your Honor, Page 68 of the

Appendlx,
That was presented by Detective Joseph VJasilewski
who apparently was present when she did pick out that photograph
of the defendant,

However, indicative, I think, of what

happened during this identification process, Miss Miller when
she picked cut that photograph didn't say, "That's the man."
She didn't say, "That's the man that raped me,"

She said,

"It looks like the man, but I'd like to see him in person,"

30
I think it indicates that she was using some care in
the identification,

I think the first photospread that was

shown to Miss Miller, the spread of 200, also indicated that
they were using great care in going about this identification,
X might point out that the Illinois Supreme Court,
in its opinion,after reviewing the record, saw the identifi­
cation made at the December 21st hearing as merely a confirma­
tion of a previous identification she -- that Miss Miller had
made during the photographic process, when she was shown the
phot ogra phic s pread,
New it should be noted and I think perhaps where some
of the confusion has come up during this ~ or with regard to
this question, is that Miss Miller, apparently, isolated three
photographs from the nine initially.

There was testimony that

the defendant's photograph was the only one with a beard, but
on page — strike that

but there is testimony in the record

and I believe that's the same page, 155 of the record, 68 of
the abstract, that the defendant's photograph was not the only
photograph in that spread of nine that had a beard.

He was the

only one of the three that she initially isolated that had a
b ea rd.
Mr. Hughes indicated also that no fingerprints «** a
fingerprint was found at the scene of the crime and it was not
that of the defendant, and there was nothing on the defendant's
pants when they were examined.

I

might point out that this

31

doesn't negate his guilt, but merely indicates that the
evidence v/as absent, or any evidence that may have been there
was not at the time that it was checked»
QUESTION:
this question:

boesn[,t this case really parse down to

In the Made and Gilbert cases', it was held by

this Court that at a lineup there is an absolute right to
counsel and no evidence of a lineup identification can be
introduced at a subsequent criminal trial if that right has
not been accorded»

I think that is more or less a correct

summary of the Wade and Gilbert rule.

And here, there was

concededly no counsel present and no advice that he had the
right to counsel»

And isn't the question whether or not this

was a lineup or its equivalent?

Because if it was, then doesn't

the Wade and Gilbert rule require that your opponent prevail?
MR o L-fVAL): That's correct,

I think that is the

issue,
And I might point out that Gilbert was decided back
in 1967 by this Court and at that time the Court stated the
balancing test that has been used by this Court on a number of
occasions, most recently in identification cases of Neil v,
Blp-gers and 34ans on y. Brethway.
may quote two lines:

And the Court stated, if I

"The desirability of deterring the

constitutionally objectionable practice must prevail over the
undesirability of excluding relevant evidence,"

That rule in

Gilbert was enunciated that time without any comment, but the

32
factors that the Court was weighing about the alternatives that
the Court was rejecting at that time.

I think that that rule

was a mistake.
QUESTION:

Your comments seem to be premised on the

assumption that there was a right to counsel at this hearing
that took place.

And I take it your brief indicates that at

least you assume there is the right to counsel.

When do you

think the right to counsel did attach in this case?

MB.. LEVAD:

I don't think there is any doubt in

this case., Your Honor, that the confrontation that occurred on
December 21, 1967, was in the midst

or after the institution

of a criminal charge.
QUESTION:

You think, under Vja.de or Gilbert, the

right to counsel had attached, and that there was a violation
of it.

was a prior identification.

There

The individual was identified,

there was other evidence against him; based upon that, a
criminal complaint was filed, and he was brought into court.
At some point during the legal proceedings against him,the
defendant would be confronted by his accuser.

He has a perfect

right to that.

In this case, it happened on his Initial appear­

ance in court.

The proceeding itself was a bend hearing.

QUESTION:

Your argument is that at this hearing no

right to counsel had attached at all and so Wad_e and Gilbert
have no applicability at all.

I don't think the right —

in this case,

MR, LEVA.a:

If this was a lineup —
If this was a lineup, Your Honor
— then Wade and Gilbert would apply,

equivalent to a lineup*
MR» LEVA j:

I don't think it is anything near a

lineup, Your Honor, or what one would ordinarily call a lineup*
QUESTION:

Are you arguing that this identification

at that hearing is the same kind of an identification as was
made in open court at the trial?
MR* LEVAD:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor# I believe it is*
In other words, your argument is it was

not a lineup at all.
MR* LEVA]):
QUESTION:

No, it was not.
Except the trial a fortiori had a right

MR, LEVAi):
QUESTION:
MR# LEVA,.):

Yes, that is correct.
Long before Vi ad e and Gilbert.
That's correct, Your Honor.

Primarily, what I am asking this Court is to re­
examine the Gilbert, v. California rule.

I think the recent

decision, Mans on v, Brathway, does have a very definite impact
on this case,

In that case, this Court held that the approach

to pretrial identification testimony, where challenged--on .due
process grounds, is to be subjected to the test of its
reliability.

What we are dealing with is --

QUESTION:

You haven't argued this in your brief,

have you?
MR» LEVAI):

No, I have not. Your Honor.

36
QUESTION:

If you lose on the Vlad e-Gilbert point, are

you relegated to an argument that this is harmless error?
MRC LEVAD:

I think we would have that opportunity to.

Yes, I am arguing also that there was harmless error, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

No lower court has ever addressed that

question.
MR. LEVAD:

The harmless error issue?

Not as such.

Your Honor, because the rulings were in favor of the state in
each case below, in each of the four courts0
QUESTION:

You don't have a finding of harmless error

until you first have a finding of error,
MRo LEVAD:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Mr * Levad, in the footnote on page 8 of

the State's brief, as I read it, you state that despite these
reservations about Wade°Gilbert, you go on to say Respondent
will concede for the purposes of this appeal that a Wade-»
Gilbert violation occurred at this preliminary proceedings.
Is that your present position?
MR. LEVAD:

Essentially, Your Honor, to the extent

that1 this was a lineup which would fall under Nad e-Gilbert»
QUESTION:

.1 don't quite understand that.

Are you

taking the position in argument here today contrary to the
footnote that Wade^GlIbert does not apply?
MR, LEVAD:

No,

What I am saying is I think Hade-

37
Gilbert does apply, to the extent that if this was a lineup
or an identification proceeding that's covered by Wade-Gilbert,
then a Wade-Gilbert violation does occur,

I don't think I am

taking a contrary position,
QUESTION:

Doesn't that footnote concession to which

Mr0 Justice Powell has referred guide you to a harmless error
position?
MR* LJJVAjj:
QUESTION:
ask:

No, it does not, Your Honor,
That's the next question I was going to

Where do you go from there?
MR, LEVAD:

First of all, the Wade-Gilbert rule and

the remedy that Gilbert applied to the in-court identification
were applied in that case to a post-indictment situation.

In

Kirby v, Illinois, the Court rejected that rule and that
remedy for the situation where the confrontation occurs prior
to institution of any criminal charge, indicating by dicta that
the right accrues after institution of a criminal charge.
This Court has never held that Gilbert applies to a
pre-indictment situation,

I am not arguing — I am urging the

Court not to extend the Gilbert rule to cover any more situations
and, as a matter of fact, to re-examine that rule because it is
inconsistent with the reasoning of the Court in Manson v,
Brathway and Neil y, Blggers,

In both those cases, the Court

was dealing with exactly the same testimony, testimony in a
pre-trial identification.

The Court —

QUESTION: Neither of those cases involved a lineup.
Wade-Gilbert is — that rule is applicable to a lineup and
only to a lineup —

QUESTION:

That's true,
or its equivalent.

And X suppose your

submission is that this case, like Mans on v, Brathway and like
the Biggers case and,uniike Wade and Gilbert, did not involve
a lineup.

Isn't that your claim?
MR. LEVAD:

Your Honor,

That's true.

That's' my-first claim,

Alternatively, if this is a lineup, that the

Court would hold —
QUESTION:

If this is a lineup or its functional

equivalent, then, as your concession pointed cut by my brother
Powell,

indicates, you concede there was a violation of Wade

and Gilbert,
MR, LEVAD:

That's

correct»
QUESTION:
was not a lineup.

Would you elaborate on why you think this
What is the difference, practically speaking,

between an accused person in the circumstances of this defen­
dant and one in the circumstances where you would concede there
were lineups, or was a lineup?
MR. LEVAD:

The purpose of a lineup — and 1 think

the purpose of the proceedings that the Wade-Gilb e rt-S fcov a11
trilogy were concerned with were proceedings during which

39
evidence was to be obtained to be used at trial, identification
evidence, in which there was some doubt as to whether that
evidence would accrue out of those proceedings
we already had an identification.

In this case,

As a matter of fact, the

Illinois Supreme Court specifically said this only confirmed
the prior identification and it was introduced as evidence,
going to the amount of bond that should be set.

It was like

a mini~prelimina.ry hearing, but it was part of a judicial
proceeding, and there was net doubt, I don't think, prior to
this that there would be — or not great doubt «— that there
would be an identification.

The other evidence had been

The purpose of the lineup —

40

QUESTION:
MR. LEVAD:

— is to identify.
Is to identify, that's correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVAD:

So the difference is what?
The difference is that prior — lineups

prior to trial have as their purpose the obtaining of evidence
against the defendant to be used at trial and to be used at
judicial proceedings prior to trial, and this was the use of
that evidence.

That was the difference.

QUESTION:

If you had a lineup in the magistrate's

officej it is your position that you wouldn't need a lawyer,
under Wade and Gilbert?

Yes.

made after the start of the hearing, correct?
MR. LEVAD:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

She signed it in the office, right then

There was no lawyer present.
Mr. Levad, let me ask you a question

about the trial itself.

The prosecutrix testified at the

trial that she had previously identified this defendant at the
preliminary hearing, however you may characterize it.

Did she

not?
MR. LEVAD:
QUESTION:

Yes, she did.
Would your case be any stronger or any

different if she had not referred back to that prior identi­
fication, but had merely confined herself to an in-court
id ent if ica t i on ?
MR. LEVAD:

To the extent that Gilbert v. California

may apply tc this case. Your Honor, yes, it would directly fall

4-2
under U»S» v« Wade, in which the only testimony that is used
at trial is the in~court identification.

Yes, it is.

Maybe I can clear that up a little bit.

The letter was a letter that was written by the girl that
testified, who testified that she had gone with the defendant,
and it was written to her doctor and was kept in that check­
book and the last tine she saw it was two days prior to this
incident,

on December 12. 196?, and on that day she gave

Mr, Moore the keys to he:.- apartment to remove some of his
possessions.

Mr, Levad, I donft quite understand that.

It seems to me that the per se rule, the automatic exclusionaryrule of Wade, and Gilbert applies only to the testimony about
the out of court identification.

It certainly doesn't apply

to the in-court identification,
MR, LEVA.!:
QUESTION:

That's true, Your Honor,
And the Court of Appeals here found that

there is an independent basis, and I take it that that is
equivalent to finding no taint on the — in connection with
the in-court identification caused by the out of court.

So,

if you are talking about a harmless error rule, unless we are
going to review and overturn the Court of Appeals 8 decision
that there was an independent basis, it leaves the in-court
identification as, perhaps, the most important piece of
evidence

attaching the Petitioner to the crime.

And if the

only thing that is going to be reversed is the -- if anything
is going to be reversed — if the only thing that's going to
