MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear first this

morning Number 75=1662, United States against Board of
Commissioners of Sheffield, Alabama.
Mr. Days.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHAI?? OF THE PETITIONER
MR. j-jAYS ;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of■ whether all
voting changes within a state designed under Section 4(b) of
the Voting Rights Act of I965 must be precleared under Section
5 of the same act.
The facts of the case are these:

In August 1965*

the state of Alabama was declared subject to Section 4 of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.

la March 1975* the City of

Sheffield, Alabama, notified the Attorney General that it
was submitting to its electorate a referendum on the question
of whether it should abandon its present three “-member commis­
sion form of government and return to an.- aldermanie or mayorcouncil form like that which governed Sheffield until 1912,
The Attorney General responded within the appropriat
60 day period that he would not interpose an objection under
Section 3 to the holding of the referendum which by that time
had already carried, but stated that any voting changes made

4
in order to implement that referendum, approving the return
to the mayor-council form, would be subject to preclearance,
The City of Sheffield’s submission to the Attorney
General of these proposed voting changes 'was
May 19?6o

completed in

In. essence, Sheffield was prepared to go to a

system in which a mayor and a nine-member council would govern.
The city would be divided into four wards.

The mayor and

council president would be elected at-large, without any
residence requirement,

The other eight council members would

be elected at large as well, two from each ward, under num­
bered post and residence requirements.
In July 1976* the Attorney General informed the
City that he would not interpose an objection to the at-large
system for electing the mayor and council president, but would
object, under .section 5* to the arrangements for electing the
eight council members.

Thereafter, no declaratory judgment

was sought by the City of 'Sheffield before a three-judge court
here in the District of Columbia, as provided by the Act,
In August 1976, this action was commenced by the
United States to enjoin elections scheduled by the City of
Sheffield, pursuant to an arrangement for electing the eight
council members to which the Attorney General had objected
A temporary restraining order was denied by a single court
single judge court and the election was held.
In December of 1976, a three»judge court dismissed

-

5
the Governments complaint on the ground that the City of
Sheffield was not a political subdivision* as defined by the
Act, because it did not conduct registrations for voting.
Therefore, the court held, it was. not subject to the preclearance requirements of Section 5°

It held additionally,

one member dissenting, that even if the City of Sheffield were
a political subdivision under the Act, the Attorney General
waived his right to object to specific elements of the mayorcouncil form of government once he indicated he had no objec­
tion to the holding of the referendum itself.
The three-judge court was clearly correct in finding
that the City of Sheffield was not a political subdivision
as defined by the Act.
QUESTION:

When the Attorney General responds to a

Section 5 request, Mr. mays, does, he ordinarily categorically
affirm or disapprove, approve or disapprove, or does he
sometimes say —
MR. DAYS:

He does not.

QUESTION:

there are just no objections.

MR. DAYS:

In some cases he says there are no

objections. In other cases request is made for additional
infornation. In other cases we indicate, acting on behalf of
the Attorney General, that there is not adequate information
upon which the Attorney General can exercise his responsi­
bilities under the Voting Rights Act.

6
In this particular case., having to do with the
holding of a referendum, it is not unusual for the Attorney
General to permit the city to go ahead with the referendum,
reserving the right to see exactly what the impact of that
referendum will be on voting rights, if in fact the referendum
has carried»
We respectfully submit that the three-judge court
erred, however, in including, based upon its determination
that Sheffield was not a political subdivision alone, that
the city was not required to submit voting changes under
Section 5 for preclearanee.

Such a reading finds little

support in the language of the statute itself in its original
legislative history, in decisions of this Court, in the admin
isfcrative practice of the Attorney General, and in the circum­
stances surrounding the extension of the '65 Act twice, in 1970
and in 1975»
The language of the statute, properly read, speaks
in terms of geography, geographic factors, not functional
terms.

Section 4(b) Indicates- • that the .substantive provisions

of the Act shall apply in any state which satisfies the pro­
visions of 4(b), namely, that it maintained a test or device on
a date specified in the Act and, secondly, that less than
50$ of its voting age population was registered or voted on
.the date specified in the Act*

Once that is established,

then 4(a) requires that no citizen shall be denied the right

7
fco vote in any state or local election because of his failure
to comply with any test or device in that state»

The preposi­

tion "in" as used in Sections 4(a) and 4(b) should reasonably
be read to mean within the geographic Confines of,, in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary.

Reference to local

as well as.federal and state elections reflects the reach of
the Act es provisions to all public elections held within a
state, not just those conducted under direct state supervis ion c
Moreover, the language of Section 4(a) which de­
scribes how a state covered

under the terms of 4(b), may

terminate such coverage, requires the state to show that for
an express period of time no denials or abridgments of the
right to vote on account of race or color, through the use of
such tests or devices, have occurred anywhere in its terri­
tory.

The word "territory" is not defined in the Act, but

it is commonly regarded as a geographic, not a functional,
term,
Where a state meets the first requirement of
Section 4(b), namely, it maintained a test or device, but
does not satisfy the second, the entire state may not be
subject fco the provisions of 4(a).

Under such circumstances,

the Act reveals that a political subdivision of that state
may be covered, however, as a separate unit.
the conjunctive phrase,

The use of

"in any state or in any political

8
subdivision of a state" in 4(b) dictates such a reading*
It is at this point that the definition of this separate
unit* the political subdivision* becomes pertinent* for only
one in which less than 50$ of the voting age population has
registered or voted on the specified date can be designated*
Section 14(c)(2) defines the political subdivision
as any county or parish,except that where registration for
voting is not conducted under the supervision of a county or par­
ish* ..The , term shall include any other subdivision of a state
which conducts registration for vofcing„

Thus a county or

parish or any other entity that supervises the conducting of
elections, which does not meet the less than 50$ of the voting
age population prevision cannot qualify as a political sub­
division for purposes of the Act.
QUESTION:

You concede, I take it, Mr. Days, that

Sheffield, Alabama, does not fall under that statutory
definition of political subdivision,
MR. .lAYo :

vie do concede that.

political subdivision under the Act.

It is not a

But we submit that the

term "political subdivision" has no operative significance
under the Act unless it is tied to the percentage-triggering
mechanism of 4(b)*
As this Court has recognized,Congress intended
through the enactment of the Voting Rights Act to rid the
country of racial, discrimination in voting.

The Act, itself.

9
was designed not only to end discriminatory practices which
Congress had found denied or abridged the right of citizens
to vote on account of race or color# but also to reach new
practices in the future that might have similar purpose or
effect»

Congress was urged by the Department of Justice to

enact the 1965 legislation because it had concluded that powers
given to it under earlier statutes to enforce the Fifteenth
Amendment on a case by case basis had proven ineffective»
This ineffectiveness had stemmed largely from the persistent
creation of new stratigems to perpetuate racial discrimination
in voting as soon as present tactics were outlawed.,

In re­

sponse# Congress marshaled .an array of potent weapons against
this evil# with authority in the Attorney General to employ
them effectively»
There is nothing in the legislative history of the
1965 Act to support the view that when a state was brought
within its provisions Congress intended to include certain
types of voting changes within that state from pre-clearance
while excluding others»

The reach was clearly designed to be

geographic and to affect actions of the state, state being
defined traditionally under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments to include any instrument of the state# such as
cities or other governmental bodies»

The legislative history

of the Act also makes clear that the term ’’political sub­
division” was defined in 14(c)(2) for very practical reasons»

10
In those situations where an entire state was not
covered under 4(b), the only smaller geographic area for which
the Director of Census could make a determination under the
formulation of 4(b)(2), as to the percentage of voting age
population that was registered and voting in the 1965
Presidential election, was the county or parish.
Although Congress has never explicitly addressed the
issue presented in this appeal, Congress extended the Voting
.■lights. Act in 1970 and in 1975 under circumstances that justify
the conclusion that it understood the preclearance provisions
of Section 5 of the Act to apply to all voting changes occur­
ring within a state or political subdivision designated under
section 4(b),
First, Congress was aware of the fact that the
Attorney General, the federal official charged with responsi­
bility for administering the Act, had consistently interpreted
it to require preclearance of all voting changes within
covered states or political subdivisions, . irrespective of
whether the submitting authority supervised the conduct of
registration for voting,
During•the consideration of the 1970 extension, the
failure of the City of Anniston, Alabama, in 1968 to obtain
preclearance of a change in its electoral system was brought
to the attention of: Congress as an example of why an extension
of the Act was required,

Anniston, like Sheffield, does not

11
conduct registration for voting,
QUESTION:

Is it clear, Mr. Bays, from that

colloquoy, the part of the legislative history you are
relying on, that Congress focused on whether or not the
particular subdivision conducted registration for voting?
MR, i,AYbs

It is not clear that Congress focused on

that particular issue to determine whether the reach was going
to be down below the county or parish level, but we think that
the environment does indicate that Congress understood what'the
reach would be.

There is nothing in the legislative history

that specifically indicates that Congress was concerned with
the city or school board level of election.
In- 1975» my predecessor, 1,..Stanley Fotfcinger
testifying in favor of further extension of the Voting Rights
Act, informed Congress that section 5 objections had been
lodged against the cities of Birmingham, Talladega and Mobile
in Alabama between 1970 and 1973^ as well as against cities
in a number of other states.
Between August 6, 1965, and May 1, 1977, the
Attorney' General has received more than 8.000 proposed changes
by nonvoter registering political units,
QUESTION:

Mr, Bays, what is a local subdivision

which is not a political subdivision as defined by the Act?
It isn't a political subdivision, but is it the state?
Section 5 says that whenever a state or poliuicc.l

subdivision makes a change it is supposed to submit *
Wow, if it is neither one of those, why is it
required to submit or how does it even get to the Attorney
General?
MR8 uAYS:

Well, the interpretation that we urge

upon the Court is that once a state is covered then all
political units —
QUESTION:

2 know it could be that it is covered

for purposes of flection 4 but there might be a clearance
procedure there going to court, but this Section 5 just says
“whenever a state or political subdivision makes a change*1'
MR* FAYS :

Well, I think it says —

QUESTION■;

You donct say the subdivision is a state,

MRo jOAYo :

I do not, but -«*

QUESTION:

Well, how does Section 5 apply to a non­

do you?

political subdivision, unless it is the state?
MR8 BAYS:

I think that the interpretation of the

term "state" as reaching to all governmental units that are
creatures of the state is how that should be interpreted*
We are not particularly concerned whether a city actually does
the submitting*

The state attorney general could do that*

QUESTION:

For purposes of Section 5 then,the

political subdivision is just irrelevant, I take it, if a
state is covered

MR, DAYS:

That5 s exactly correct;. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Then what meaning does the language.»

’’political subdivision, " have, Mr». Days?
MR., DAYS :

I think its meaning is tied to the

triggering mechanism under 4(b)'{2).

In other words, the Act

is not designed to cover every political subdivision.

It

covers only political subdivisions within those states that
have tests and devices and which meet the 5Q% or below ^0%
triggering mechanism.
One cannot understand the use of the phrase,
"political subdivision," in 4(a), for example, merely by
looking at 14(c)(2),

One has to look to 4(b)(2) and that

triggering mechanism to understand what it means.

If one were

to look at 14(c)(2) alone and then look at 4(a), the conclusion
that one would have t.o reach is that any county or parish
that conducted registration would be covered by the Act, even
though it did not meet the below 50$ triggering mechanism.
In other words, 14(c)(2) is defined in part by the triggering
mechanism of 4(b) (2).
QUESTION:

I think a political subdivision cam.be

covered even though the state in which it exists is not,
MR, DAYS:

That is .correct.

The three-judge court, itself, recognized that once
a state was .covered every political subdivision within the
state would be covered as well.

Of course, under those

circumstances ,count A es within the State of Alabama would not
be specifically designated.
state designation,,

They would some in along with the

And it makes little sense, we submit,to

suggest that subdivisions below the county or parish would not
also be brought in under that logic,
t might say that over TOO of such changes submitted
to the Attorney General from Alabama, under'section 5? have
come from nonregistering units within that, such as cities»
The second thing that Congress was aware of was the
fact that this Court had construed Section 5 to reach voting
changes in covered states or political subdivisions that
altered the election lav; in even a minor way, even where such
changes did not relate directly to the registration process
itselfo
This Court's decisions in Allen were specifically
mentioned in the testimony in legislative history of the 1970
extension.

And the Perkins decision was much discussed in

the proceedings leading up to the 1975 extension, particularly
as it related to ending voting discrimination in Texas cities,
Moreover, Congress was aware that the Attorney General had
adopted a reading of Section 5 consistent’with this Court's
rulings in Allen and Perkins to reach changes involving redistricting, annexations, relocation of polling places anc.
of election laws relating to numbered posts, staggered terms
ano candidate riling fees, at the state, county and city level,

15
We respectfully submit that the factors I have
described demonstrate that the interpretation given Section 5
by the three-judge court exempting certain voting changes
within states designated under section 4(b) from preclearance
requirement# depending on whether they supervise,

the con­

ducting of registration for voting# is erroneous and should
be reversed,
• Over half of the submissions to the Attorney General
since 1965 have been from non-registering governmental units.
The intent of Congress to subject to Section 5 preclearance
voting changes of governmental units that did not conduct
registration is most clearly seen in the legislative history
of the 1975 extension* for there the major focus of the testi­
mony and debate over extending coverage to the ctata of Texas
was that it would serve to check changes to at-large majority
runoff systems by cities and school boards# governmental
entities that do not conduct registration in the dtate of
Texas £
If the court below was correct# then Congress which
enacted the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and extended it twice,
thinking that its provisions would eradicate the insidious and
pervasive evil of discrimination in voting, devised a solution
that missed the mark by half.
Your Honor, at this time, I would like to reserve
additional time for rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. BURGER:

Very well, Mr* Days*

Mr* McAlisterc,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VINCENT J0 Me A LISTER, JR., ESQ,.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MRa MeALISTER:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
"I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the
destiny of democracy.

I urge every member of both parties,

Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every
section of the country to join me in that cause.

At times

history and fate meet at a single time in a single place
to steps a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.
So it was at Lexington and Concord*
at Appomattox...

So it was a century ago

So it was last week at Selma, Alabama."

From that lofty and noble beginning by President
Johnson in March of 1965, the Voting Rights Act was presented:
to a Joint Session of Congress.

Today, twelve and a half

years later, X appear before you representing the City of
Sheffield, Alabama, in a suit which we think is. out of the
shadows and perversion of that great Act.
Sheffield, Alabama, is a city of 13,000 people.
Vie are located in Northwest Alabama, about 20 miles equal
distance from Mississippi and Tennessee.

We are on the banks

of the Tennessee River, 40 miles upstream from Shiloh Landing,
a part of the Muscle Shoals and Tennessee Valley Authority area .

Our town began in 1885 with a mayor-council form of
government which we retained until 1912 when we changed to a
commission form of government»

The commission form remained

in force from 1912 until 1975 when* as a result of a special
referendum* the citizens elected to revert back to the mayorcouncil form.
The laws of the State of Alabama govern the creation
organization and function of cities in the state.

The law

requires that in cities of Sheffield's population that -cities holding a mayor-council form of government — that the
councilman be elected at-large and reside within the wards
established.
The change in the form of government in Sheffield
in 1975 was precipitated by voter apathy in the commission
form, a desire to have a full-time mayor and the hope for
more citizen involvement in local government.
in harsh of 1975* prior to the referendum, the
mayor of the City of Sheffield wrote the Attorney General
advising of the proposed referendum and the Attorney General
replied that he did not interpose any objection to the refer­
endum.
Let me stop at this point to emphasize that under
Alabama law once you elect through a referendum and the
citizens vote in the referendum to change the form of govern­
ment, that sets in motion a slain of events that cannot be

18
stopped by the will or choice of any elected officials in the.
city.

The city must than prepare for the change from the

commission to the mayor-council.

That involves qualifications

of candidates, setting of election-dates, establishing of the
wards „
QUESTION?

At the time you.wrote to the Attorney

General, you certainly must have thought that Sheffield was
covered,
MR* McALXSTER:
QUESTION:

Well, the Mayor wrote that letter*

Well, he thought that Sheffield was

covered5 didn *t he?
v

MR* Me AI .ISTER:

V

'

He thought that possibly it was

covered»
QUESTION:

Any doubt expressed in his communication?

MR. McAIiISTER:

In his communication, he expressed,

he said, "I don't, think that, we are coveredj I am just
writing you out of an abundance of precaution," in essence*
And we say at that particular point if the Attorney
General had an objection,he knew what the laws of Alabama ware
as well as we did, and he knew that once the citizens voted
to have a mayor-council form that we were bound under state
law to have our election at-large.
candidates were to run at-large.

In other words, the
That's what Alabama law

required *
QUESTION:

Now you are directing your argument 'now

19
to the second issue there#. aren't you?
MR, McALXLTLR:
QUESTION:

That's right•

I am.

Which-we don't reach# if you are right on

the first issue,
MR. McALIQTER:

That's correct.

So, we think that at that point if he had an objec­
tion to what we were doing,the time to object should have been
right then, but to wait over a year later and come in and say
"We approve everything else you've done# but we don't approve
of your electing your candidates at “large,11 we think, you know,
that was ridiculous.

Let's object to that in the beginning if

t ha tE s wha t you a re ofo ject ing to,'
QUESTION:

May I come back to a point you made?

MR, MeALISTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

Loss Alabama law require that elections

in Sheffield be at "large, once that vote was favorable in the
referendum?
MR, MeALISTER:
QUESTIONt

Yes. sir.

Mo option whatever at the local level?

MR., Me A liIS TER:

No, sir.

Further, the Attorney General seeks to impose what
we think is hi& will on the City of Sheffield through the
force and power of the federal government, without any basic
of law.

There is a dangerous equation in this ease to the ray

the Attorney General thinks with the law.

At the risk of being

20
elementary, I would remind the Attorney General that it was
out of that same Lexington and Concord that President Johnson
referred to in 1965 that produced' these words:

"In the

government of the Commonwealth of' Massachusetts, the legis­
lative, executive and judicial power shall be placed in
separate departments to the end that it might be a government
of laws and not of men»"
The Voting .Rights Act does not apply to Sheffield.
It doesn't require any strained semantics or legal gymnastics
to make it apply.

The Act applies only to a state or a

political subdivision that denies or abridges the right of
a citizen to vote on account of race or color.
^

A political

subdivision is defined in the Act, and everybody admits that
Sheffield does not fall within that definition,
QUESTION:

Loss the City of Anniston fail in that

definition?
MR. Me A LISTER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Roes any city in Alabama?

MR. MCALISTER:

No, sir.

No city in Alabama

registers voters,
QUESTION:
^

All I am saying is:

Has the Attorney

General said that?
MR. Me A.I, IS TER:

I thought that the Solicitor General

just said that,
QUESTION:

That all of the cities are exempt from

dx

the Act?
MR* Me A LISTER;

He said that no city in Alabama

registers voters and is not a political subdivision within
the definition of the Act*
QUESTION:

But did he say Anniston was included

under the Act?
MR» McALISTER;
QUESTION:

I don't think so*

His position is that Sheffield is* too*

Anniston* Sheffield, all of them are*
MR, McALISTER:

His position is that every political

unit in a state is within the Act*
QUESTION:

)

A state *— in the State of Alabama,

MR* McALISTER:

Yes, sir.

Of course, he doesn't say what a political unit is
either,
QUESTION:

Well, he says that, in effect, once a

state is covered you look to the nature of the change, rather
than to the type of political unit that’s making it*
MRs McALISTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but what kind of change?

Well, the kinds of change, I suppose, that

have been decided in previous cases of this Court.

4
MR0 McALISTER:

In what kind of political unit?

In

other words, in a state or in a local community you might have
an agricultural stabilization committee or a water drainage
district.

In our area we have a water district that might take

The University of Alabama?

Yes, sir,

MR* MCALISTER:
QUESTION:

We don’t know»

No, sir»

Well, then, it is not a political sub­

Would you agree?
MR. MeALISTER:

No,, sir,

I don’t know what the

definition of a political unit is,
QUESTION:

I thought your position was that the

statute tells us what a political subdivision is.
MR* McAIISTER:
QUESTION:

That’s exactly right,

So we don’t have to wonder under your

submission.
MR c Me A LISTER:

Yes, sir.

We say that the Act does not purport to apply to a
city that does not register voters.

And, again we point out

that the aim of the I9S5 Act was to register voters.

And,

again referring to President Johnson’s speech, he says:
(the bill) will provide for citizens to be registered by
officials of the United States Government if the state
officials refuse to register them»*'

"It

The bill was introduced in the Congress in 1965>
the following day, if we recall, that President Johnson made
his speech.

Mr. Katzenbach, the then Attorney General,

appeared before the Congress and explained the Voting Rights
Act to the committee that was handling the bill.

He testified

at length and I have quoted in my brief from his testimony
before that committee,

Mr, Katzenbach had no doubt in his

mind, how voter registration was conducted in the State of
Alabama.

He stated that he knew how it was conducted in the

State of Alabama„
And we state this to the Court:

How can a piece of

legislation like the Voting.Rights Act that was aimed at a
particular state, Alabama, aimed by the President of the
United States -»- that triggered his speech, Selma, Alabama
aimed by the Attorney General of the United States —
Mr, Katzenbach said he knew how voters were registered in
Alabama «« and aimed by the Congress, why do we at this point
have to end up, according to the argument of the Solicitor
General, looking to some type of ambiguity in the Act to come
forth with, the way the Attorney General has, construed the
Act and the subsequent re-enactments of the Act by the
Congress?
It just doesn’t make sense to us that an Act aimed
at curing a particular wrong could end up to be so ambiguous.
We say it is-not ambiguous,

we say it is clear.

We say that

24
the construction that the Attorney seeks to place on the Act
is clearly erroneous.

The only justification for his argument

«— and he makes it in the brief -»«*> is that we need, uniformity
in the application.of this Act.

Also, he says, that the case

by case process of solving voter problems is inefficient.
V/e. would answer that this way.

Oliver Flint, the

black councilman in Alabama, Sheffield, that was elected in
this at “large election, he doesn't appreciate the uniformity
argument at all, and he would prefer the case by cage method
because he would be assured under that method of retaining
his seat on the council.
Also, vie state that the argument cf the Attorney
General fails completely under scrutiny.

Section 4 of'the

Act, upon which Section 5 depends, deals exclusively with
state and political subdivisions that use discriminatory tests
or devices to deny persons the right to vote.

You must be a

voter registering state or political subdivision to have a
test or device.

Sheffield has none.

QUESTION:

Well, a state is covered whether or not

it does carry on a registering function.
covered,

A state is ©imply

It's covered, isn't it?
MR, MeALISTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Sir.

There is no test as to whether or not it

registers voters, is there?
MR, McAnlYTER:

Well, it says in 4 that the triggerir S

feature in 4 is a state or political subdivision that has tests
or devices.

Ordinarily the state legislature would have pro­

vided for the so-called tests or devices that were struck down.
QUESTION:

So a state that has a test or device is

covered, —
MRa MeALieTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

— and a political subdivision that has

a test or device is covered and a state, everybody, presumably,
knows what a state is.
MR * McALISTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.,

And this case involves the issue of what

is a political subdivision.
MR» MeA LISTER:

Yes, sir.

VJe also state that under the Act, in using our logic,
it is completely sensible to apply it that way.

Under Section

5 of the Act, if you recall, there is a procedure for a
declaratory judgment in the District Court of Washington,
JD. C,j by a state or political subdivision.
I think we could go into the District Court in
Washington, E, C., and get dismissed because we are not a
political subdivision and we can't get that declaratory
judgment.
QUESTION:

X doubt if the Attorney General would

file a motion to dismiss —
MR. Me A LI - TE R:

The court might on its own motion.

Further, our third point about the argument of the
Attorney General is:

We think it leads to absurd applications.

.1 mentioned that before.

He says political units and we say

to apply this Act or seek to apply it to school elections,
water districts, drainage districts, agricultural committees
and others is a perversion of a good Act.
In conclusion, we say that the City of Sheffield is
not covered by the Voting Rights Act and that the opinion of
the district court should be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. McAlister.

Do you have anything further, Mr, Bays.?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DAYS:

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice, just a few

comments,
Counsel was asked whether Sheffield doubted its
coverage under Section 5»

I believe page 14 of the Appendix

which contains the March 20th letter, indicates that Sheffield
did not consider itself.excluded from Section 5 coverage.
There was* merely some question about whether that specific
change was subject to Section 5.

Page 14 of the Appendix.

The first time that the specific issue *aised here was
presented to the court was in the postalrial brief of the
City of Sheffield,

2?
QUJbTION:
letter

ok

How about the second paragraph of that

page 14, General Days* where It says — of the

Appendix

"while it is doubtful that this proposition as to

change of forms of municipal government is covered by the
1965 Voting Rights Act," donEt you think there is some
intimation in that language or of the position now taken by
the Appellee here?
MR, DAYS:

I would concede that there is some

intimation but I think that read more exactly it refers to
not whether the city itself is covered but whether this
particular change is covered under Section 5 and requires
preclearance.

QUESTION:

That5s whafc it says„

MR, DAYS:

Now, insofar as the force of Alabama

law is concerned, once a referendum of this kind takes place*
I submit that the record reflects that there xuas a great deal
of confusion as to exactly how Alabama law would come into
play in this case.

The city itself said it was returning to

the form of government in existence in 1912.

An opinion of

the Attorney General of Alabama in 1968 seemed to indicate that
a return to that form would require election by districts, not
at "large.

The Attorney General's opinion is in the Appendix

at page 54=
And, therefore, there was some, we submit, reason­
able doubt as to how the Alabama law would apply, whether the

28

law in force in 1976 would have any force and effect at all*
insofar as how far down Section 5 provisions reach, we think
)

that there is some guidance on counsel's example of University
of Alabama elections.

First of all, this Court has spoken in

such cases as Terry v. Adams about elections at which public
issues are decided, that that's what the Fifteenth Amendment
is designed to reach»

Secondly, on page 26 of our brief, we

quote a statement by Attorney General Katzenbach in which he
responds to a question:
a school board?"
Mr. Chairman.
I

"Would it cover an election for

And he responded:

"Yes, it would,

Every election in which registered electors are

permitted to vote would be covered by this bill."
And finally, the Act itself, in Section 14(b)(1),
provides some guidance as to its reach because it talks about
elections such as primary, special or general elections, and
talks about candidates for public or party office and proposi ­
tions for which votes are received in an election.
We submit that all these definitions give a fairly
clear sense of the scope, of .section 5, insofar as elections
are concerned.
Thank you, very much.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:44 o'clock, a.m,, the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
