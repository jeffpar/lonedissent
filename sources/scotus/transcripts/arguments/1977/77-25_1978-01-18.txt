MRS CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Altman., I think you may proceed whenever you’re
ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALVIN ALTMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS FLAGG BROTHERS
INC,, ETC,, ST AL.
MR, ALTMAN*

Ms:, Chief Justice, may it pleases the

Court:

f
The, issu.-a before the Court is the presence or absence

of State action in tira sale by a warehouseman of household
goods t a & ..'?/,••• of t:na household goods deposited by a warehouse
depositor i-’lu hca defaulted in payr-airt of the storage charges,
tha sale being made pursuant to New York Uniform Commercialc Cod®, Section 7- 210.
The petitioner is the warehouseman t respondents are
two deposi3 of warehouse goods, household goods»

While

the xacts in c.i.ch case ar® not identical, they are substant!..ally
similar.
Both -respondents, tenants in an apartment dwelling
in Mount lemon. New York, cunre evicted from their s^sp^ctiva
.r m.: Tits by court ordsr,

■>n the. day of tha ovictiot, its petitioner warehouse**

4
i»aa, acting on behalf of

landlords, tbo ©dieting landlord,

to effectuate the removal of the household goods from th©
apartment to th© sidewalkf appeared at th© apartment and
entered into discussions with th© respondents.
1 may point out to -th© Court that these two occasions
did not; occur on the same day, they were separate occasions on
dif ferent days.
As a result of the discussion in th© Brooks case,
respondent Brooks requested teat her household effects be
removed from tee apartment to petitioner’ a warehouse rather
than leaving tea goods on th© sidewalk.

|

--n tu® uonea case, th© respondent Jones was present
w.v~th the warehouscman in th© apartment at the time of
ission, made a call to tee Department of Social Services

'V

purpose of obtrd.ni.ng: approval for getting funds to pay

tee iirasispsrotation charges and to pay storage -charges'.

\

v.-ii.e Department of Social Services approved one month’s

After & period or time ©lapsed, both accounts became

Section 7-210 was unconstitutional, being in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment due process.

present.
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.
,

Since the bedrock principi® of the Fourteenth

Amendment is a prohibition against State action and not
individual action, no matter how harmful or hurtful, the
question is:

whether the State of New York was so involved
*

in the sal® that the action of the warehouseman may be
t
fairly treated as the action of the State of New York?
QUESTION:

Mr. Altman, in that connection, just as

a matter of curiosity, if you prevail her©, what remedies do
the respcncisnts he.v© under the New York system for any
alleg®d wrongs?
MR. ALTMAN:

If w * prevail here, Your Honor, the

remedies of the respondente are, of course, to go into court t
to onjoin cnj action in which they f«s®l the warehouseman has
not complied with the rigorous- safeguards of the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. ALTMAN:

For damages, if they haves?
They hc-.v-c an action for damages, Mr.

Chisf Justice, for any infrachion of the statute, no matter
how minute? sad they have an action

for conversion in the

complaining about; is that th® UCC gives your client an
additional dafens© to a claim for conversion in th© State
courts of New York, isn’t it?
MR. ALTMAN:

Well, that is so, Mr. Justice.

Rehnquisjt? but, of course, in addition, they have taken the
position that th© conferral of th© right of.sale upon th©
<r

warehouseman is an action associated with sovereignty -- is a
right associated with sovereignty, which you deny -QUESTION:
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:

But if th© UCC weren't even in existence
Yes, Sir.
*— end there was nothing on the books at

ail with rasp-ect to what a warehousemen could do, common law
or statutory law, presumably if ‘the warehouseman, without any
vSt.

!"i

contractual right to do so, tool? a

.

illor's goods dfct and

sold them, the bailor could sua fox* conversion.
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And ti.a UCC simply says that you follow

these, wh&t you describe as rigorous procedures ~~ and l
presume your opponent characterizes thorn otherwise — you
will hr.vs o. *::;.vsfens'a to that, Stats court, action for conversion.
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Th«rv.:'si no .v./tt&cik here on th® *— even,

assuming e Utera action, thera’s no -attack on the lien itself,
is there?

7
MRe ALTMAN:

No, Your Honor.

The only attack is on the control of the right of
sale.
QUESTION:

The control of the right to sell, and

th©
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— in fact, in these cases there was no

sale with respect to either one of the named parties now
before us —
MR. ALTMANs
QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor.
Is that correct?

MR. ALTMAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Yas.

QUESTIONs

Was there a contract between the ware­

houseman and the party whose goods wars stored?
MR. ALTMAN:

In the on© case. Mr. Justice Powell,

there was a storage receipt, a warehouse receipt, which w©
claim has all of the elements of a contract in it.
QUESTION;

Is the warehouse receipt in the record

here?
MR. ALTMAN

;■

There-

is — the warehouse receipt of
-

the particular petitioner tvarehousaman, and there is also a
warehouse receipt which is used more commonly throughout the
industry y so the Courts has before it the receipt issued in
this particular case, plus the receipt which is in common

$

8
us age,
QUESTION;

Does that; receipt# the on© issued in tills

case, refer to Section 7“210?
HR. ALTMAN;

Not in those words# Your Honor.

QUESTIONs What does it say that’s relevant to this
case# if anything?
MR. ALTMAN;

There is

&

provision in that warehouse

receipt which confers the right of sal© by the warehouseman
in the event of a default in payment.
However# there is no specific pointing out of
S e c tl on 7-210.
QUESTION; Could you rely on that contract# rather
than the New York statute?
You can in a deed of trust in my State.
MR. ALTMANs We believe that you can rely on that
contract.

Of course# in this c&sss# if I may point out# Your

Honor# we have a special situation in that it was an emergency
situation.

Thera was not the normal time to prepare the

storage contract# the warehouse receipt in the ordinary case
where there is

&

removal to storage. This was an emergency#

whereby the goods were being removed to the sidewalk? and# in
order to prevent that# the warehouseman took the goods into
s torags.
QUESTION;
r@cai.pt,?

Did the bailor sign the warehouse

9
MR. ALTMAN:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So how could it be a contract then?

MR. ALTMAN:

W® submit that ther«s is an implied

contract based on all of the facts in this instance.
QUESTION:

Hut not a writing signed by the party

to be charged or anything?
MR. ALTMAN:

That is correct. Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, it’s like if you want to store your
goods, you store them on these terms or we won't store them;
and

so they stored the goods.

That's what it amounts to,

1 suppose.
MR„ ALTMAN:

Not quit®, Your Honor, if I may

disagree. There was —
QUESTION: Well, whet more is there?

In this case

at least.
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:

There was the right —■
In terras of a contract.

MR, ALTMAN: Well — right. Thera was the right of
the bailor to obtain a different warehouseman if she did not
■agree to the terras as specified by this particular warehouse­
man,
QUESTION:

Yes, but she —

QUESTION:

You mean she had the choica not to give

QUESTION:

Well, you couldn’t suggest that she

it to him?

10

knew anything, had any notion of what the terms were when
you took th® goods away.
It was an emergency, as you said.
MR. ALTMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

The choice was to either give it to .him

or to leave it out in the street.
MR. ALTMANi

Or try to obtain the services of

another warehouseman; that's true, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTIONs But. your implied contract must imply a
power of sale, which is in the written contract, isn't it?
MR. ALTMAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION; How do you imply a power of sale in just
a storage contract?
MR. ALTMANs Well, Your Honor, we imply it, first,
because the statute itself should b® considered, and the
statute itself should be considered in the terms of & contract.
That is one way.
And then we say, Your Honor*, that this is a —
QUESTION:

There are statutes of limitation on

the power of the parties to contract, is there not?
MR. ALTMAN:

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice.

Yes, it is

definitely a limitation.
QUESTIONs

Why shouldn't the warehouseman frame a

contract that would solve this problem?

11
That: is consistent: with the terras of the statute.
MR. ALTMAN: That could very well be dona, and that
is the case,- Hr. Justice Powell, in the vast majority of
warehouse deposits, the contracts are specific on this point.
The documentation, the warehouse receipt of the storage
contract.

It so happens in this particular* case that was not

don® for the reasons that I've mentioned.
QUESTIONi

This case cam® to the Court of Appeals

after the district court dismissed the complaint?
MR. ALTMAN: Y©s, vYour Honor.
QUESTION: And tbs posture of the case, therefor®, is
that we assume that the allegations of the complaint are all
true; and, taking those allegations, there’s no contract in
this case.
The question, as you quite accurately said at the
outset of your argument, and the only question before us, is
whether tha action of your client was State action.
MR. ALTMAN: That's correct, air.
QUESTION:

Isn't, that right?

MR. ALTMAN: That’s correct, sir.
We respectfully submit that State involvement in a
disputed private act must be significant, affirmative, all
but ordering the challenged activity, and that tha delegation
of sovereign, power in an economic due process setting is
insufficient to cross the Stata action threshold.

We would

12
points out, that the New York Commercial Coda is a permissive
statute. Th©r® is no direction in the statute to sell.

The

decision to sell is tha decision of the warehouseman, it’s a
private decision arrived at by a private party in a private
transaction, with no State official bsing present, no State
encouragement whatsoever.
QUESTIONS

On that point, Mr. Altman, without a

contract and without a statute, do you think your client would
have gone ahead and sold?
MR. ALTMAN; Without a contract and without the
statute
QUESTION:
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:

You say that —
— I would —
Isn’t the statute a fairly important

part of the whole picture?
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION*

Yes.

Yes, it is.

Otherwise, you’d have to go to court too

foreclose your lien.
MR. ALTMAN: That is correct.
QUESTION:
MR. ALTMAN *

Yes.
That is correct.

QUESTION: And the question, I guess, is whether
it’s under color of State law, in the sens© that it's something

that would not have been dons without the statute.
MR. ALTMAN: That** right, sir.

13
And on til at. issue, may I say that: the conferral of
this right of sal® is not the delegation of a power associated
with sovereignty.

Far

from being a power associated with

sovereignty, this statute is the codificati.on of a power to
dispose of property which any private party' had at common lav?.
The power of sale was an attribute of ownership,, and at common
law, position was deemed to be, was presumed to ba ownership.
QUESTION:

That doesn't -— now, you state that

under the law of bailor or bailee at common law, the bailee
could sell the property7 without taking it to court?
MR. ALTMAN:

The bailee could sell the property under

common law if possession had bean voluntarily delivered to
him, yes, Mr. Justice
QUESTION;
MR. ALTMAN:
QUESTION:
may, Mr. Almam:

And without going to court at all?
Yes, sir.
Let me ask you one more question, if I

Supposing that, contrary to your answer

»

4

Mr. Justice White, at common law the bailee had absolutely
no power to sell without going to court, but the New York
Court of Appeals, without any statute at all, had said,
"We're not going to follow that branch of the common law,
we're going to enunciate' a new principi® that the bailee does
have the power to sell"7 so that without statute, but as a
result of decisional law of the New York Court of Appeals
your client would have the same right as now conferred on it

14
by statute.

Do you. think the case would be any different

here?
QUESTIONs

No, you don't,

MR. ALTMAN;

In. so far as a seizure is not concerned

in this case, in so far as possession was delivered voluntarily,
I don't think there would be any difference.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. SETH GREENWALD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LEFKOWITZ
MR. GREENWALD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
My c©-*counsel has stated the relevant facts of this
case.

The Attorney General of the State of New York has

intervened, end intervened at the district court level, by
the way, to defend the constitutionality of the State law?
and at this time there is only on© provision involved,
Uniform Commercial Cod©., Section 7-210.
And, of course, the New York State Legislature,
several years ago, passed that statute; but it is my contention
that that is not enough to make this a matter of State action.
I think there's really no dispute about that”.
And that -~

That is, the simple enactment of the

QUESTION: Well, really, what w© hav© here is whether
we're relying on the language of 1983, or whether w@'re relying

The fact of the matinr is there has to be soma

once again getting back to the magic words -*- there must be
some State action that has deprived you of your constitutional

MR. GREEN WALD:

MR. GREENV/AliDs
QUESTION:

Yes, it has to *—

-- constitutional right, no matter how

gross the deprivation might be.
MR. GREEI1WALD:

Yes. And I think that was determined

back, in the civil rights cases, I think over a century ago.
QUESTION:

There's been a lot of water over the

dam sine© then!
MR. GREENWALDs

Well, I don't think that much, 1

think the law still is — has been reaffirmed only a few
yearn ago by this Court in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison.
But I think it's worthwhile to emphasize to this
Court that not only has New York passed the Uniform Commercial
Code, 48 other State Legislatures plus the District of
Columbia have passed this section that's under challenge
her®.

So, of course, it's rather obvious we have a statute

with nationwide impact.
And this statute simply regulates and authorises
the exercise of power of non-judicial sale by the warehouseman.,
where his customer may have disappeared, don© any sort of
thing, and not paid his bill.
Now, there may be a dispute about the bill, but
that's something else.

That's not a constitutional dispute.

at r say, in spa.■ ki^g about the UCC, this statute, though,

18
datas much further back than. UCC, which a product of a
distinguished group of legal authorities of the late 50’s
and early 1960's.

It dates back in New York, back to 1879.

And it is based on,

and I'd emphasize tails, it's part of

a uniform statutory scheme of warehousemen having a specific
possessory lien over stored goods in his possession, and th*s
statute, by regulating sal© by the warehouseman, is basically
a wholesome statute*

And —

QUESTION: Well, what, difference does it make when
New York first enacted th® statute?

Supposing that there was

no statute on the books and no decisional law in New York,
had just become a member of the union, and the Court of
Appeals was first estellshed and had no cases at all on thin
subject, and this precis© case cam© before it. The Court of
Appeals would have had to decide on® way or another, whether
the bailor, b&JLie© — whether the bailee had a right to sell
without going to court, wouldn't it?
MRe GREENWALD: Well, 1 put. it this way:

age is not

a determinative factor, and of course — but when we speak of,
and this Court hart spoken of, the traditional function of the
State, it becomes of interest. And I simply say "of interest",
how old is the statute? because when tee court below, the
Court of Appeals decision, said that w@ had transferred by tee
UCC provision a traditional function of th© State, and I can
cit:©

and thoy t von themselves cits th® fact that it dates

13
back 'to 1879, and perhaps even longer in other States, it.
hardly becomes a traditional. Stato function for a warehouseman
to exercise the power of non-judicial sale when his lien,
which is not under question her®, is still outstanding.
QUESTION; Ar© you going to touch at any time on the
question of possible raootness?
MR. GREHNWALDs Well, I have in my brief, of course,
pointed out that —
QUESTION:

do

If you want to rely on th® brief, you may

,

30

MR. GREENWALB:
brief.

Yes, I would prefer to rely on my

As I say, I have many things to say here, and I think

they would go to the merits.
As I say, and I mentioned Jackson v. Metropolitan
Edison case, which had to do with utility cutoffs, this Court
ehumarated, went so the extent of ©numerating what are
traditional functions of th® State.

And, quite interestingly,

not on© of them even closely approached non-judicial sals by
a v&rohc-usramaa or anyone else.
It's really & total sbroth of th© imagination to
call a non-judicial sale, which was only thro&taned in th®
instant case and never carried out, or it cannot be now, to
V

call that a traditional function of a sheriff.

Because &

sheriff has a significant power of sovereignty that th©
warehouseman does not have.

Basically stated, a sheriff

20

seizes property, and this is something that & warehouseman
cannot do, did note, do in this case, and never will do»
Because his lien is based on voluntary conventual possession.
And there*s another aspect when yen’ re speaking about
State action»

It has been generally recognized that this

Court and any court is much quicker to find a delegation of a
Stats function, Stats — a traditional State function in a
case that involves racial discrimination.
racial discrimination

Because that

is at th© heart of the purpose of the

Fourteenth Amendment when it was passed, and what we all
know is that debtor-creditor relations really had nothing to
do with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not
involved on® iota.
And I think it's rather obvious that in New York a
sale by a warehouseman, like they are challenging here and
claiming the State action th® respondents ate claiming, is
not a traditional State function.
Now, there is some authority in the New York Court
of Appeals which th© respondents cite that says it is a
traditional State function.

That is the Ulya case.

But:; I emphasize — and I was involved in the Blye
c&s®, I argued that to th© Attorney general up in Albany.
That

c&stj

involved a lien sal®, it did not involve a lien —*

it involved, ©reuse me, liens, simply liens, not & lien
sal®? involved an innkeeper's lien which is a basically differ-

21
ent type of Him than & warehousemen * e 11®»«
And finally}, and most importantly, the decision of
the Hew York Court of Appeals simply doesn't control this
Court, even the cases that respondents cite show that you make
®a independent determination in a case where there’s a federal
constitutional issue.
And, once again, X would emphasise ‘that the question
°£ State action is one of great importance because, at the
present time, w® have & conflict in the Circuits:

the Ninth

Circuit in California has clearly stated —

Hr. Greenw&ld, you’re down to five

liR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION %

Y©s, I'm going to ~~

<*•“ ara you going to get to the Chief

Justice’s question of mootness?
As X understand it, that Miss Jones paid the money
and that the other oaa, by agreement they removed her*
MR. GREENWALD: Well, as i said, I said *•*» and the
Cfc.i.©f Justice accepted my statement, that X would raly on the
brief.
QUESTION; Well, I didn’t.
MR. GREENWALD; But you haven’t.

Okay, then I will

address my answer —» yes, the point is that Mrs. Jones,the
lafea Mrs. Jones, at the termination of the district court case,,
by her own action, paid her bill and got her goods back,

it

22

wasn't a cose of Mr. Altm&n trying to moot; this case out,
tills was a matter ©£ the plaintiff taking action, in effect,
to rssolvo the question.

Of course, she now states that she

didn't gat all her goods back, and some war© in damaged
condition? but that is a State law question, it's certainly
not a constitutional issu®.
And I might point out also, of course, that my c©~
counsel has differing views as to the mootness of this case,
and he has a client who would fight, is very anxious to get
this matter resolved, because it has been around for an awful
long tiis®.
40

But I have pointed out to Your Honors that, having
an actual case of controversy is a necessary ingredient to
the case, end I felt the obligation to inform Your Honors.
At ‘this point X would like to reserve my remaining
time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN A. SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it; pleas©

•fchs Courts
Before I

commence my argument, I vjould Xik© to

address th@ question of mootness.
Mrs. Jones claims that th® $1600 payment she mad©
during the course of th© litigation was not mad© voluntarily,
but at least in part bo cause of th© threat of sal®.

Sh®

would have a claim for damages, at least for part of that
$1600 payment.
la addition, I closely point out to th© Court that
th® defendants charged Mrs. Jones an auctioneer's fa®,
presumably for a scheduled sale, and under the Cod®, in order
for a person whose goods are stored to exercise a right of
r@dempt.ion, part of th© cost which must be paid are the fees
involved in the carrying out of the contemplated or actual
sal©.

I think this claim for damages is sufficient to keep

th® case alive.
I would ©iso point out that in all of these consumer
due process cases which have been brought th© last few years,
there is virtually an inherent problem in mootaess.
this out to the circuit court.

W® pointed

Wo prepared an Appendix in

the circuit court which listed th® various cases, and the
status of the goods during the litigation. And it is inevitable

25
that: & threat of sal© will act continua during an entire
lengthy litigation period»

W© brought this case at th@ time

the threat of sale existed,

We submit that was th@ proper time

to bring the cm®, to try to stop the sal©»

The laws serve

that purpose»
But it’s not reasonable to suppose that that will
continue during the course of a three or four-year litigation
period»

X would say that the “capable of repetition yet

evading review** doctrine would also apply to this type of
situation.
And X would also point out. **»*
QUESTIONS

Wall, it seems to me that & woman# X

of not being able to pay storage ia the future.
MR. SCHWARTZs

She —

MR. SCHWARTZ:

that $1600 payment —

But. she claims it was not a voluntary

This woman was left without all her possessions, —
. QUESTION:

For how long?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Your Honor.

— for virtually a two-year period,

And of course the payment of the auctioneer's

26
fss® would only have to b© mad© because the statute was
invoked against; h«ar.
I also would Ilk© to point out th&t we have filed an
action on behalf of a client whoa® goods have bean sold
already in th® Southern District, and It has bean assigned
to til® same judge before whom th® Brook© case was assigned®
And th© only reason that w® could not move to intervene

that client into the Brooks

action is because the circuit

court stayed its own mandats© remanding th® action to th®
district court pending proceedings in this Court®

S© there

is another case which has been filed; as I say, it if as just
& mar® formality®
I would also point out that th© parties did stipulatis
to til© propriety of the class here.

There was no certifica­

tion, th© district; court fch©r© so ordered th© stipulation,
but we -«
QUESTIONS

Well, some of the parties stipulated,

not all ©f them —MR. SCHWARTZs

Well, at the tim® stipulation was

entered into, 'Hour Honor, th© Attorney General and th®
Associations were not parties to the lawsuit.
QUESTION'S

But now they are.
*

MR® SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION;

Nov; they are, but «*-

And they have it stipulated.

MR. SCHWARTZs

Well, I would also point out that

27

the action clearly meats all th® requirements of Rul© 23(a)
and (b)(2).

It's clearly the type of action that subdivision

(b)(2) was intended to apply to.
QUESTIONs Well, wa can’t consider it unless it’s
certified.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I understand that, Your Honor. I'm

just saying that it’s another factor to consider if the cases
was remanded back to the district court as the circuit court
contemplated.

Th© circuit court ©pinion, I believe, contem­

plates that the action is a proper class action, but that
to© only question is th© propriety of to® scopa.

We did

©very thing possible to get this cl-ass certified.
We entered into a stipulation, went to oversight
or whatever, to© std.pulat.ion wasn't approved, we moved for
class certification, th® district judge didn't pass on to®
cert-1 fic&tei on.
QUESTION: And then you —
MR. SCHWARTZs

W© appealed —

QUESTIONS And then you asked for summary judgment.
MR. SCHWARTZs

I mean, ws moved for a class

certification and summary judgment at th© same time, Your
Honor.

We then appealed from to© denial of th© class

certification as well.

As I say, th© only reason there's

any mootness problem her© at all is because th© circuit
court stayed its own mandat®.

Otherwise, this new client,

28
Mrs, Svendsen, would have intervened into 'She Brooks action»
But w® do have an acid on filed on behalf of somebody whos©
goods were sold»
Your Honors, the plaintiffs’ intention is that
Stata actiosi is present in tills case, foe cans© we have a
direct, precis® and significant nssxus focrtwesn the State and
th© contested activity»
The State has delegated two warehouses tfo® extra­
ordinary power to summarily sell a bailor’s goods» And in
doing so, w© contend that New York has delegated to warehouse­
man the public functions of lien enforcement and non-consensual
dispute resolution»
QUESTIONs Without that delegation, where would the
power of sale foe?
MR» SCHWARTZ:

Thera would be no power of sale,

Your Honor, and ctespit© what my adversary said, the authorities
era ia consistant agreement, and wa’vca cited them in the
brief, there was no power of sal© at common lav?.

It is

clear, I don't know hew my adversary can make the statement
to tli® contraryt but the bailee's right at common law was
merely the right to retain possession of the goods.
QUESTIONS

What about —

QUESTION :

And go to court, h@ could go to court»

MR. SCHWARTZi
QUESTION:

H© could —

And foreclose his lien.

29
MR. SCHWARTZ:

The norm at common law, if the

bail®© sought to enforce his lien, his remedy was to bring an
action to court, and if h® proved his claim and defeated
defenses and obtained a judgment, the sheriff would then
levy execution on the vary goods that were sold.
QUESTION: Well, in some respects that involves
almost mors State action than this, doesn't it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I would say that this is a direct

substituta for that pro csss.

That is a judicial process,

judicial deterralnatioa, and judicial enforcement.
And cur position is 'dint & person whose goods are
sold under this statute, under Section 7-210, stands in the
precis© posture of a defendant in a judicial action, against
whom a judgment has been gotten and enforced with on©
exception, and that exception is that the person whose goods
are sold under Section 7-210 does not get an opportunity to
b© ha&rd prior, to sal©.

Whora&s, the person whos© goods are

sold after a judicial process ding presumably does,
QUESTION:

Well, is your claim of State action

based on the Legislature's enactment of the statute?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Our primary claim, Your Honor, is

that the tmactsaenfc of the statute constitutes tSie delegation
of power which is normally associated with sovereignty,

QUESTION’:

Okay.

Supposing that without any such

statute the New York Court of Appeals, as a matter ©f common

30
law, had reached precisely the same result:?
MR» SCHWARTZ;
same.

My position would h&v® to fo© the

If the New York courts, if te© New York Court of

Appeals had recognized that the ostensibly private sector
had th© power to ©3c©rcis« functions which are governmental in
nature, w® would nevertheless have a delegation from th©
public sector to the private sector of governmental power»
QUESTION: So it*3 not the enactment of the statute,
it*a tho -- any recognition by a body in New York that is
capable of laying down law, that a warehouseman has a defense
to a conversion action in this situation?
MR» SCHWARTSs

It's th© delegation ©f sovereign

power by any branch of the government? that's right, Your
Honor»
QUESTION:

Well, when you say dcslsg&tion ©f

sovereign power, but all it really is is a da fans® to a
conversion action»
MR* SCHWARTZ:

It’s more than a defense, Your Honor,

because these goods ar® sold without a hearing»
QUESTION; But in a conversion action th© goods
would have b®@a taken without a hearing*
MR» SCHWARTZ;

That’s — & conversion action would

corns about fo@cs.us© ©f an unlawful sal©»
QUESTION; And her©
MR. SCHWARTZ;

What this statute does is make this

31
sale lawful*

It makes what would have been an unlawful act

a lawful act.
QUESTIONS So it gives thorn a defense to an otherwise
unlawful act by way of conversion
MR* SCHWARTZS

§It gives them more than a defense*

It gives them much more than a dafans©*

It gives them a

defense if an action in conversion is brought* but if an
action in conwrion is not brought* it gives them the power
to resolve this dispute by selling a parson's goods summarily*
QUESTIONS Well* just as if a converter takes your
goods and does away with them and you never a urn him* h® gmta
away scot-£r©a.
MR* SCHWARTZ:

Well* that's true, but if a case

was brought, it would be an unlawful act*

The Stats hare is

making lawful what would otherwise would be clearly unlawful
at common law*

There's no question about that*

QUESTION;

Well* you don't just mean —

QUESTION;

Not that alone* certainly* you've got

to go further than that*
MR* SCHWARTZs

We don't rely on that at all*

W© «-

the heart of cur claim is this* that this parson whose goods
are sold stands in the same position as a defendant in a
judicial proceeding* against whom a judgment was taken and
against whom that judgment was enforced by th© power of sal®
of his goods*

And w@ would say that what is involved her®

32

are tha combination functions ©f non-conssnfcu&i disputa
resolution, which is normally, historically and judicially
carried out by the courts, together with lien enforcement,
which is an enforcing mechanism which is normally carried out
by sheriffs and constables®
QUESTION?

If it wen clear at common law that

tills power of sale existed, would you b© making the same

argument?
MR® SCHWARTS?

I would have to, consistently, Your

Honor, because the common law would then be recognizing that
tii@ private sector has what we claim to be a power of the
sovereign®

I cannot
QUESTION;

I cannot

So you view their argument as to what

common law was to b© immaterial?
MR* SCHWARTZ;

No, I don't think it's immaterial*

Perhaps the circuit court stated the proposition too broadly,
whan they spoke about ths-s statutory reversal of the common
law in a vacuum.

I think the statutory reversal of the common

law is relevant in two somewhat limited respects,
First of all, how tha function was carried out at
common lav? tends to give us soma evidence as to whether that
function was in the private and public sector*

For example,

in tills case it's clear that the private sector did not haw
the power bo determine these disputes and to enforce liens.
So it's some evidence that the power was not lodged in the

33
privat® sector at common law.
And, on the contrary,

in response to Mr. Justice

White's question, I stated that what happened at cosmon, law
was that the — it would in fact b@ ©nforc@d after &
judicial proceeding and enforcement by th© sheriff.

So that

at common law this is a function which historically and
traditionally was carried out by courts and sheriffs and
constables.
In addition, I think the lack of common law authority
is significant in that it shows that when th© warehouseman
doss exercise his power, h© is acting under and only under
this particular statute.

He must be acting in reliance upon

the statute.
QUESTION:

Would you b© making the same argument

if all the State law said is that in bailor-bail©® situations
we’ll go just by the contract, whatever the parties agree to?
if the parties agree to a private sal®, that's the @nd of it.
*

MR. SCHWARTZi
QUESTION;

Your Honor, —

That would be State authorization of a

private sal©, and that would be enough for you, I take it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
contract.

Your question presupposes a valid

If —
QUESTION; Well, ysa , it does.
MR. SCHWARTZ;

All right.

If w© had a valid

contractual power of sal®, I would say that this would be a

34

prims example of a creditor's remedy which cam© about: as a
result of a contractual voluntary agreement»

That is —

QUESTION? Even though it comas about becaus® of
this State law simply authorizes parties to agra© on a private
salai would that be State action?
MR» SCHWARTS;

Well, now you’res assuming th©

existence of th© statui®»

Yes, 1 am.

I'm just trying to

Then it would bo State action,

QUESTION;

Well, the statute says — th® statute

says whatever th® parties agree to with respect to a privat®
sale is all right with us» That's what th® statute says»
And the parties agree to a private sal®»
Now, is the State involved in that —•
MR. SCHWARTZ;

If it’s totally contractual, I would

say that th© State is not involved.

But —•

QUESTION: Well, the —
QUESTION; But th® wh©l© source of enforcement of law
V

for contracts is th© State sovereignty, under Austen or anybody
els®.

In many societies a written agreement b®tum@n tern

parties is not enforced by the sov©r®ign.

35
MR. SCHWARTZi

But if w© have a valid contract,

with &, power of sal® in that contract, «•«
QUESTIONs

Well, valid, you jautomatically have

reference 'to State law right there,
MR, SCHWARTZ;

Well, w© may haves reference by

to State lawi but the power of sal© came about b©cause the
parties mutually, consentu&lly agreed that upon default the
w areh o us am an would have th© power of sal©.

That’s

not what

w@ have in this case.
In this case we have a power of sal© which exists
only by operation of the statute.
QUESTIONs

Well, you dd agra© that there’s a lien?

MR, SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

We d©

not contest ~~

In common law there was a lien,

MR. SCHWARTS:

W® do not contest th© lien.

Th©

constitutionality of the lien we are not contesting.
QUESTION:

Well, what doss th® lien mean, that you

can sell it?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Th© lien at

common lav? is defined

as th® right to detain the?, goods indefinitely, until th®

bailor makes all tha payments which the bailee claims are
due and owing.
QUESTION:

And?

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

No.

And that is all.
And ha can go to court*

36
MR» SCHWARTZ*

H© can go to court, but any other

QUESTION: Right»
MR» SCHWARTS:

T!i© norm is for a creditor, who

claims h© has an amount due and owing, to bring a judicial
proceeding, provs his claim, if ha can defeat defensas,
obtain a judgment? and seek to ©afore© that judgment.
This statuta, in effect, short-circuits that entire

process.
If X could get. back to Mr. Jus tie® White's question,
the differences batsman a contractual power of sal© and th©
statutory power of sale is tha difference between voluntary
dispute resolution, which hes historically and traditionally
b© in the private sector, and involuntary, non-consentual
disputa resolution which has historically and traditionally
been the fmotion of tin© courts and sheriffs.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN A. SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS — R@EU.mad
MR. SCHWARTZs

Thank you, Your Honor.

In Jack a on ..vs. Metropolitan Edison Company, this
Court: stated that the characterization which the Stata courts
giva to a function, as to whether that function is public or
privata in nature, is entitled to weight in making th©
datmmination whether the State has delegated a public function
to the ostensibly private sector.
The rational© for this, we respectfully submit, 1»
that just as th® State courts have the expertise —
QUESTIONS

Well, new you say a public function.

You sort of lost m® there.

What about ~~ the State of New

York, I assume, grants licenses to — dees it grant licenses
to truck lines as well as -~
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Th® granting of the license itself,

of course# would be a public function? but th© activities
carried out under that license might be public,might fos
private, depending upon th© nature of th© powers that were
delegated.
QUESTIONt Well, soma trucking companies own ware-

33

houses, and aora® warehousing companies own lines of trucks,
too, don’t th@y?
MR. SCHWARTZs

The general every-day acti'vities of

warehouse companies, I would concade, are functions which are
privat® ia natur©-

They are generally contractual relation­

ships, contracts of moving and storageThe question here is whether the State's delegation
of the power of summary sale is of that type of nature, whether
it's privat® in natures or whether this is the type of function
which historically and traditionally has been associated with
sovereignty, whether it's a public function.
And ray point is that the characterisation given by
a State court as to whether that function is public or privat®
in nature should b® given sera© weight by this Court in making
that determination.

And the rational© for that is that tee

State courts, just as they have the expertis® on questions of
Stats law, are in a particularly good position, particularly
the highest court in the State, to evaluate whether a function
is public or private in the particular State.
And in this case, in New York, the New York Court
of Appeals, ia Blye vs. Globa-Wamick® Company, has concluded
that in New York lien enforcement historically and traditionally
has been the function of the sheriff.
Now, the Attorney General seeks to distinguish the
Blya cas© as a cm® involving a seizure of coeds under the

39
innkeeper*s lien law.

However, th® Court; of Appeals # in Blye,

did not, hold that, it’s th® seizure which constitutes a public
function# bus, rather# held that it’s th® execution, of a lien,
xeg&rdl&ss of th© method of lien ©nforcement, which in Now
York has been the function of th® sheriff. And in fact cited
two typos of lisas, judgment liana and liens which arise from
an action to judicially foreclose a mortgage, which are lians
which can bc2 enforced by sale and without seizure.
In addition# the Appellate Division in New York has
concluded that lien enforcement# where accomplished by sal©
and without seizure# is also & function which historically and
traditionally has been th© function of th© sheriff in New York.,
QUESTION:

But you don’t — you don’t contend that

th© actual sal© is an act of th© State# do you?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It’s not an act by a State official.

But wo say that th® —
QUESTION; Wall# is it by th© Stats?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It is an act which is equivalent, to

tfii® exarcie® of sovereign power,

it is something which we

contend historically —
QUESTION.; Wel-1/"'you wouldn’t say the State is liable
if# for example, th© person misuses th© power?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

W@ would not say the State if liable,

any more so than w© would say that the State would be liable
in Evans vs. Newton, in the case whs»© the function of running

40

a park has been delegated.

It's public under the State

action doctrina, it doesn’t mean that the State has liability
for the acts of th© defendant.

That would b@ true in all the

public functi,on cases which this Court has d©cid©d„
I would also stress that the decisions —

hm

But your point is that this defendant

MR. SCHI'?ART2:

Our point is that this defendant, is

QUESTION: As though
MR, SCHWARTSs

it were a State.

That’s right.

And •Suer®for® it's liable under 19 83,

That’s right.

MRo SCHWARTZ;

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

W®

contend that that makes tills statuta worse than the statutes
which wore involved in the Sn.ig.dadi, Fu&nfeB and Dl Cham cases.
QUESTION:

Would your theory mak© all powers ©f sale

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Absolutely not, Your Honor. Because

they come about an a result of a contractual agreement.
W® sharply distinguish -~
QUESTION;

But as a substitute for what, I think,

you have at least implied, is that traditional common law
sovereign act.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It’s a substitute, Your Honor, when

it’s exercised as a result of non~cons©ntual dispute resolution.
When it’s a substitute for the functions exercised by the
courts and sheriffs.

It is not a substitute when it comes

about m a result of a voluntary mutual agreement between the
parties.

That, historically and traditionally, has be®n in

the privat® sector.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schwarts, may I ask you & question?

If t3i®r® were compliance — or non*»compliance with a statutory
procedure, it says failure to give a notice the statute
requires, something like that, would you say that was State
action?

43

QUESTIONs Sure,
QUESTION:

Could you sue in a federal court, on the

ground that there was a failure to comply with the Stats —*
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Th@ failure to give the no tic®

slight constitute not only a Stats rule law, but if there is
Stats action in this am®, as w© contend, then it would also
constitute a violation of th© du© procsss clause.

Because

our subs tanti've claim is that an owner of the goods should h®
given adequate notice ©nd some opportunity to be heard prior
to the sal®.
QUESTION:

But if h© acts without the statute,

without complying with the statute, is fe© then acting under
color of State law?
MR. SCHWARTS:

Your Honor, hs might be acting in

violation of State law, but in threatening to soli or in
engaging in the sal® itself, he would necessarily be invoking
the power of th© statute.
Otherwise he could not sell.
QUESTION:

What I*ei really asking is, is it your

position that th® federal court has jurisdiction ofevery case
arising under on® of these statutas, or are you only contending
that th© court has jurisdiction to determine a constitutionali1^
of til© basic procedure?
I guess you’re arguing the former.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

W« ara only arguing that the court

44

has th© jurisdiction to determine whether there's been &
constihution&l violation, a violation of du® procsss, which
I take it to be the latter»
QUESTION; But there could be a violation of du©
procsss resulting from a failure to follow the state
procedure?
MR® SCHWARTS;

That's right®

Because our basic

claim is that due procsss r@£@rs som@ opportunity to b® heard
prior t& the sal©®

The statute does not provide for any

opportunity to fos h@&rd.
QUESTION*

You say there's the same kind ©£ state

action whether or not the defendant complies with the statutory
procedure?
■ MR. SCHWARTZ:

I can't see a distinction, Your

Honor, because the —QUESTIONs

Wellg in on© cas© he's acting under color

of the State law, and the other

to the State law®
MR. SCHWARTZ;
QUESTIONs
MR. SCHWARTS:

But in You don't draw a distinction —
'Ia exercising th© power of sal©,

h©*s invoking th© statutory power.

He may have engaged in

soma procedural irregularity along th© way, but when h© makes

that determination to sell, and he in fact sells, h® is

MR. SCHWARTS:

That's right..

Now, whether he

requirements, those &rs all, of courses, generally questions of
State law.
QUESTION: Well, th© State deprived him ©f his
property without clue procsss of law.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's right.

I might also say that those are normally questions
which would be determined at a hearing prior to th© sale.
Whether th® warehouseman has a proper lien, the amount, ©f the
charges, the extent of the lien, whether #ie proper notification
provisions were given, and so forth.

Those are questions,

primarily questions of State law, which would be resolved at
a du® procsss hearing prior to the sale.

It's the lack of that;

Mr. Sehwartz, vrhat

about th® provision

MR. SCHWARTZ;

Your Honor, there is no contractual

power of sale in this case.

In the case of plaintiff Jonas,

What about the other one?

MR. SCHWARTZ;

In th© case of plaintiff Brooks,

imaginable, it refers to a right of sale if goods &r® not

this Court indicated that there were several factors that might

lead & court# as a matter of Stata law# to conclude» that this
tar pa of contractual power of sal© would be an invalid contract
of adhesion# the unequal bargaining power, th@ fact that the

a fine-print form contract# these would b® other factors
which might lead the court to conclude that there was no valid

But your argument leads you# doesn't it#

to conclude —
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Does what?

Doesn't your argument lead you to the

ton that you could have a voluntary agreement between
the bailor and bailee here# which didn't comply with the
Uniform Warehouse — with the UCC provision* but was perfectly
valid under the Fourteenth Amendment# sine© it was entirely
consensual?
MR. SCHWARTS:

If fears is a consentual power of

sal©# and it was valid as a matter of State law, —
QUESTION:

Well# supposing it's invalid as & matter

of State law?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well# then W8 would not have a

contractual power of sale.

Then# in that case# fee power of

MR. Schwartz s

A person who is interested in the

dispute, such as the war©hous©man, should not have th@ power
to unilaterally resolve that disputo by the forced sal© of
another person's property, without giving that other person
an opportunity to b© heard.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Schwarts.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Greenw&ld?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A. SETH GREENWALD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER LEFKOWIT2
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes.

In response to respondento5

argument, early on there was a mention of & — and it’s been
mentioned again — a stipulation about class action.

As has

b-aen recognised by this Court, the Attorney General didn't
sign this, and an awful

many other parties did not sign

this so-called class action stipulation.
So we are parties to this case, so are these other
people; so it basically is inoperative.
Furthermore, 1 think I should emphasize that the
respondent seems to fos saying that h© wants us to bring —
not us, but the warehouseman to bring — serve a summons and
complaint and bring a court action.

As has been pointed out,

X think in the reply brief of the petitioner Flagg Brothers,
that brings into play, when the sheriff goes out to execute
the judgment lien, brings into play the question of to©
household goods exemption provided by the New York State

51

statute, said makes a world of problems, which I don’t have time
to go into now.
Now, I think that, one© again, there's a claim here
tliat there isn't an opportunity to b@ heard.

Well, the claim,

as I now hear it, that there's no opportunity to b© heard,
ha says h@ has no opportunity to fo© heard before to© sal©.
Well, that's questionable.

But what I wish to

emphasize to Your Honors is that the sal® is not such a
significent event.

The customer can be heard before the

sal®,

if he has a vigorous attorney and that he wants to be heard
before the sale, seeking an injunction or to® like; or he can
be heard, as he very frequently is, after to® sale, claiming
in an action of conversion

that toe sal® wasn't properly

conducted and the Ilk®.

This is a completo opportunity to be heard.

It can

result in th©
QUESTIONS

Yes, but that's after his property,

some of it perhaps personal, irreplaceable personal property,
has been sold.
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, once again 1 would point out

that we’re dealing here with personal property, and you use
to® term "irreplaceable".

I would say the personal property

can be replaced by money.

Money.will replace it.

QUESTION;

Of course# it's really a question of

whether there's a violation of the due process, rather than
the State action issue, I guess.
MR. GREENWALD;
QUESTION;
State action issue?

Right.

May I just ask you one question on the
Some'times a hypothetical will illustrat®

a position.
Supposing New York passed a statute that said;

if

a man is large enough and strong enough, h© can go next door
and take his neighbor's chattels, his lawn mower, on© thing
and «mother, and then h© has the power to sell them to a third
party and give good title.
to that statute.

And som-aone does that, pursuant

Could you get federal jurisdiction to

challenge that statute?
MR. GREENWALD: Well, that raises another issue,
which is not in this case.

That raises the issue of general

non-possessory liens, which, is a totally differant problem
from the warehouseman's lien.
QUESTION;

Well, under that hypothetical, do you

think the man would be acting under color of Stat» law?
Within the meaning of 1983»
MR» GREENWALD;
before us»

Well, I don’t think that question is

But I would say that th® State of New York cannot

QUESTION:

But the question is, how do w© decide

when Stats action is involved, -~
MR» GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Well, —

— when action is authorized by a

statute, but no State official participates?

Is it your

view teat unless a State official participatas, there's never
a State action?
MR. GREENWALD:

Right, I would say teat where a

State official does not participate, it's much more difficult
to find State action.
QUESTION:

In racial disputas —

That’s th©

question.

QUESTION; Do you think that would implicat® State

conversion could go into the district court and say; The

MR. GREENWALD:

No, because w@ actually had that

case with our no™fault law, and I think it was appealed up
to this Court, where we, under the no-fault insurance provision,

57

we provided that any dispulse about, no-faults benefits, auto
insurance, ±e subject, to binding arbitration, it basically
was •taken out of tile courts of the Stats of New York because

that is the example that is operative in that situation.
