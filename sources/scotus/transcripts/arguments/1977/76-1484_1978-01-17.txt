MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 76-1484, Eurcher against the Stanford Daily et
al and the related case.
Mr. Collins, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. ERIC COLLINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS BERGNA ET AL
MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
These consolidated

casas come tc you on writ of

certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed a summary
judgment affording declaratory relief in a Federal Civil
Rights Act case.
The case involvas search warrants and attorneys’
fees.

i'i

I appear on behalf of the District Attorney and
his deputy and I shall sfc,.;te the case for you and attempt to
argue the search issues and the fees issues insofar as they
affect prosecutorial and judicial immunity.
Mr. Robert Booth, Junior, here, wi ll appear on,
behalf of Chief Eurcher and the Police Petitioners and will
argue those fees issues.
l

lie will take ten minutes.

should like, Mr. Chief Justice, tc reserve a

couple of minutes for rebuttal.

Thank you, sir.

On Friday, April the 9th, 1971, the medical dir­
ector of Stanford University Hospital called upon the Palo
Alto police to remove a group of demonstrators who had barri­
caded themselves in Stanford University Hospital.
Now, the main action and the press and the police
was on the west side of the building.

There, the demonstra­

tors had barricaded the doors, chained them shut and papered
over the glass panels„

The police attempted to force the

doors and were driven, back by a shower of heavy missiles.
Several were injured.
Eventually, ropes were brought,
dragged partly open.

One door was

The chains were cut and the police got

in.
Now, they tried first, of course, unsuccessfully,
to persuade these people to move peacefully but this failed.
Now, that was on the west side.
there were also doors.

On the east side,

These, too, had been barricaded shut

and papered over, preventing police identification.
When the police broke in the west side, suddenly
the doors on the east side were opened and all the demonstra­
tors erupted out of them.
Now, on the cast side there was a squad of eight
men.

Four were facing to the rear, where there were sympa­

thisers in the hall and four were facing the glass doors.
Trey attempted to hold the baton line and were successful for

5

four or five seconds but were clubbed to the ground.
nine were injured, three severely.

They could not identify

That was on Friday.

Now, the following Sunday a special edition of the
Stan ford Daily,

the student newspaper, was published.

That

showed clearly that a photographer or one of them of that
newspaper had been in the position where he could have seen
and photographed the east side entrance and that is what we
are concerned with.
The police went to the District Attorney, District
Attorney Brown, asking for a search warrant.

Brown had had

poenaes had been unsuccessful.
The editor testified to the effect that a few of
the photographs were aval.'table.

The others had been mis­

The defease had had full access to the

photographs and he had done the best he could.
Another staffer had the temerity to testify that
the photographs were dangerous to have around and some had
been sent to Tokyo for safekeeping.
Now, this was the District Attorney's experience
at that time*

He decided,, with the officer, to apply for a

search warrant, a search warrant which, .recording bo California
law, specifically authorises the seizure of evidence from any

6

person or placa, provideri, of course, there .is probable
cause and the rest.
V

Judge Phelps of the Palo Alto Municipal Court
issued the warrant.

He authorised a search for film, nega­

tives and photographs.
Monday afternoon.

The warrant was executed at 5:30 on

The officers asked for but; did not get

cooperation in producing the photographs.
After waiting a few minutes, they searched the
photo lab and the main office which was ir. some considerable
disarray.

They searched desk tops, unlocked drawers, filing

tops and, I add, no materials were ruined.

As far as possible,

they returned everything to the place it was found.
During the search the officers were subjected to
harassing comments and they were photographed many times.

No

claim of confidentiality was made by any member of the staff
at any time to any person.
The search lasted 15 minutes.

Nothing was seized.

One month later, in May, 1971, the Stanford Daily
filed suit in Federal District. Court seeking injunctive and
declaratory relief.
Affidavits were filed.

Depositions were noted.

Put before the depositions of the Stanford Dailyhs witnesses
could be taken, their motion for summary judgment was granted
and declaratory relief was afforded.

Wa3 *-n i§72.

The District Court laid down two new rules.

One,

7

in all third party searches — that is to say, searches of
persons who are not suspected of crime, in addition to the
historical requirements of particularity, specificity and
probable cause, the affidavit must also contain probable cause
to believe that the materials will be destroyed or removed
or that otherwise a subpoena was impractical„

That is one.

There was a special rule where First Amendment
values are involved.

This time, said the Court, there must

be a clear showing that first, the materials are important
and secondly, that a restraining order would be futile.
In 1973, attorney's fees were awarded by separate
opinion on a private attorney's general theory.
In 1974, these fees were set at $27,500.
In 1977, the Ninth Circuit adopted che search
opinion but they used the 1976 Civil Rights i?ees Awards Act,
Attorney's Fees Awards Act, to authorize the granted fees and
then confirmed the District Court's calculation of $47,500.
Rehearing and suggestions for hearing on banc were
denied and these petitions come before you.

Those are the

facts of the case and the statement of them.
Your Honors, it is our essential position that the
District. Court and, indeed, now, counsel did not realize the
extent of the rule they fashioned.
QUESTION:

If, Mr. Collins —

MR. COLLINS:

Yes, sir?

8

QUESTION:

If a subpoena duces tecum must be

sought first, or these other preliminaries and v;e decide
against you, that would be the end of the case, would it not?
Because there was not any subpoena duces tecum sought and
there was not any allegation of the kind that the District
Court prescribed.
HR. COLLINS:

It

is certainly true, Your Honor,

that in the affidavit presented to Judge Phelps, there was
no sworn statement of the impracticality which in fact,
attended to this case»
QUESTION:

Then, would we have to go on to decide

whether the public statement of the Stanford Daily made pre­
viously that they would not aid any prosecution or preserve
any evidence or submit any evidence that would help the socalled "political prosecution" ~~ we would have to then move
on to that question.
MR. COLLINS;
that it reads as follows:

Yes, sir.

May I remind this Court

"Negatives which can be used to

convict protestors will be destroyed.

The Daily feels no

obligation to help in the prosecution of students for crimes
related to political activity."

That was before.

Noy, in all fairness to the Daily I must add that
afterwards that policy was somewhat amended.

Now it apparent­

ly is, the standing policy is to destroy ail potentially in­
criminating unpublished py ,y, ;.raphic material.

9

I might add that even on this, the Board was split
and as to these particular events involving the injuries and
the damage caused, the Board split 50—50; 50 percent thought
it warranted and 50 unwarranted.
QUESTION;

Yes, sir?

Mr. Collins, if they destroyed them

immediately, then you cannot — what are you going to do then?
MR. COLLINS;

Your Honor, it is our hope that the

Stanford Daily will not set a precedent for the remainder of
#
the media. If they do destroy it immediately, we obviously
cannot get it.

You are quite right.

But if we were to take the disarray of the offices
as indicative of the efficiency —
QUESTION;

I io not think that has; anything to do

with this case.
MR, COLLINS;
QUESTION:

Very well, Your Honor.

I just think that the duces tecum

should do it without a search warrant.

Should it not?

That

would be the normal way.
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, it is true and —

And then there would be a motion to

quash and you could have it out.

Everybody would have his

day in court.
MR. COLLINS:

In any event. Your Honor, they are

going to have the day in court.,
QUESTION;

They do not have the day in court if

10

you qefc- an ex parte seam warrant and come in there and
search the place.
MR. COLLINS:

May I distinguish between two situa­

tions, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

Well, help yourself,

MR. COLLINS:

In the run, it is undoubtedly true,

if Your Honor's point is this — if Your Honor's point is,
there is not a prior full adversary hearing to the taking of
those photographs, then of course Your Honor is correct but
may I add this?

It is undoubtedly true there will be an ad­

versary hearing on the return.
QUESTION:

The question facing —•

Then we do not need a warrant any how.

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, there are in this case,

considerations that would indicate a warrant should fce used.
First, as the affidavit:-: show, thepe are staffers
who have a flirting relationship, I think is a fair charac­
terisation, with the paper.
Now, as to their, whether they are bound by this or
not, we do not know,

They

are the stringers and so on.

Secondly, what I am suggesting is this, that I may
say, I will do X but my efficiency in doing so is a matter
that may or may not occur.
QUESTION:

It may or may not.

I do not know of any injunction that

can control all of mankind's actions.
MR. COLLINS;

I thoroughly agree with Your Honor.

11
In fact, I would say this, that any attempt by any
court in advance to exercise that kind of restraint over the
press should be abhorad.

We could not do it.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Of course not.

If you wish to reserve

any time for rebuttal and allow your colleague-ten minutes,
to.speak ~MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

This would be the time

to think about that.
MR. COLLINS:

four Honor, of course.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Booth.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT K. BOOTH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS SURCHER ET AL
MR. BOOTH:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

I represent Chief Zurcher and the four other Police
Petitioners in this matter.
Our contention is two-fold; first

that no claim

has been stated o-r proven against these officers under section
1983 and secondly, that whether or not such a claim has been
stated or proven, the- judicial and prosecutorial immunity
should extend to the court’s agents in carrying out lawful
c ourt orders.

At the very least, the special circumstances

here make it manifestly unjust and unfair to award attorney* s
fees against these officers.

12
First of all,

even though the Respondents in this

case sought an injunction and were granted declaratory relief,
there still is a necessity to prove elements of tort in order
to hold them

liable»

Any duty which these Petitioners owed

to the Respondents has bean fully met.
Chief Zurcher did not order, did not supervise
and was not evan aware of the acts complained of in this suit;»
Neither was District Attorney Bergna.
QUESTION;
to costs?

Would you concede that they are entitled

That the prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to

costs in an injunctive action such as this where; you say one
of your clients was not even aware of it?
MR. BOOTH;
Justice Rehnquist.

Not as against Chief Zurcher,

He is not a proper party to this case.

He is not at all.
QUESTION;

Well, supposing someone is found to be

the proper subject of an injunction because of his participa­
tion in an unconstitutional activity or his failure to pro­
perly supervise employees, something of that sort sc that an
injunction issues, although he did not have any knowledge of
the act for which he was •— which was on the basis of the
injunction-

If an injunction issues against him is the Plain­

tiff entitled to costs?
MR. BOOTH;

1 think under those circumstances,

yes, Justice Rehnquist, but X do not believe under Section

13
1983

-that there is any such theory of respondiat superior.
QUESTION:

Well, so then your argument about, the

impropriety of awarding attorneys' fees is based on your con­
tention that the Plaintiff should not have prevailed on the
merits against your client?
MR. BOOTH:

No, it is based on a lack of a cause

of action against my client and also on what I believe should
be an extension under the circumstances here of the judicial
and prosecutorial immunity because these officers were acting
as agents cf the court carrying out the command of the court.
QUESTION;

But judicial prosecutorial immunity is

an affirmative defense which might not disentitle the Plain­
tiffs to an injunction or declaratory judgment even though it
might disentitle them to damages and if they were under those,
circumstances entitled to declaratory judgment, would they
also be entitled to costs or not?

Assuming that they did

state a claim under 1983 and should have prevailed cn their
declaratory judgment action but should not have gotten
damages because of the immunity defense.
MR. BOOTH:

It is my recollection that they would

be entitled to costs, Justice Rehnquist.
talking about a great difference

However, we are

in degree here.

The costs

in a suit of the type you described are substantially less
and not the type of burden, nor do they carry

with it the

stigma that an award of attorneys' fees against these clients

14
would.
QUESTION:

Well, that is the problem we had after

Edelrnan against Jordon, isn't it, of the old Fairmounfc
Creameries case and this ease where the court said you could
award

costs against a state, you cannot award damages against

a state and the questions are, are attorneys’ fees more like
costs or are they more like damages?
MR, BOOTH:

I think whan they reach this type of

level in the circumstances under which they arise, I believe
that they are more like damages-,
I would further point out that one of the addi­
tional police officers should not be held liable here, either.
He furnished an affidavit which was the truth.
contested that.

No one has

And- again later on, he participated in the

search yet his acts violated no duty to these Respondents.
QUESTION:

responsibility of each person you are talking about?

MR. BOOTH:

Bee, they ware, Yov.r Honor.
And they were held to b e liable?
Yes, they were, Your Honor.
Wei", what are you arguing about now?
I am arguing that they were improperly

They were held
QUESTION:

And you want us to reverse that holding.

We have to go all the way back to that holding, do we not?

15
MR. BOOTH;

1 believe that is the case and I think

you can do that by finding that there was no cause of action
stated under Section 198S
QUESTION:

But I do not see how you separate the

attorney fees of the finding.
both of them.

I think you have to get rid of

That is all I was saying.

MR. BOOTH;
QUESTION:
MR. BOOTH:

Wall, I think, Mr. Justice —
Can I separate them?
Yes, I believe you can do it,

Mr. Justice Marshall,
QUESTION:
MR. BOOTH;

What authority do you have?
I think that regardless of whether a

cause of action was stated, I think that the special circum­
stances of this case would make it unfair to penalize these
Petitioners even if they are liable for the search here, with
t

attorneys' fees.
QUESTION;

And what statute is the unfair statute?

I mean, I cannot do it as being unfair.
MR. BOOTH:

It arises out of interpretation of

statute, the 1976 Civil Rights Act Amendments.
QUESTION:

You want me to use the Chancellor's foot

MR. BOOTH:

I am sorry, sir, I die. net understand,.

MR. BOOTH:

Well, in a sense,

I think

that the —
QUESTION?
MR. BOOTH;

Or would it be more than that?
Well, I do not believe that under the

circumstances here where attorneys5 fees were awarded in 19 71,
five years before the Act was amended and the circumstances
of this case with summary judgment and never an opportunity
to present defenses like pood faith and probable cause, that
it would be unjust to apply attorneys' fees regardless of the
outcome of the remainder yZ the case.
We would point out that the Court acts only through
its agents.

In this case it is police officers and under the

'ireumatances they should be put in the same category here as
court clerks, bailiffs and other agents of the court.
did not do anything improper.

They

They got an order of the court.

They served it in a proper and appropriate fashion.
You do not have the kind of facts that lead to the
aggravated situations in which all of us would be offended.
These officers acted in a proper fashion as agents of the
court.
In fact, Judge Peckham, in dismissing the municipal
court judge from this case found "Nothing but good faith in
discharging his judicial responsibilities" in the judge and I
would suggest to the Couch that that type of finding should,
be extended in this case, to thane police, officers•

They

17
acted in

good faith also, carrying out the command of the

court.
QUESTION;

Quite apart front any immunity, would

not they then have a Wool against Strickland kind of defense?

In part, yes, Your Honor.
Which is, as far as the Court has so

far decided, is available to any defendant
QUESTION;

sued under 1983.

But you take the position that summary

judgment prevented that.
MR. BOOTH:

Well, I think that is part of it but

I think also it was a misinterpretation of the applicability
of 1983 and also was completely ignoring the
which should be applied in this case.

We have cases like

Piersen versus day and Rhodes versus Houston, a Federal
Supplement case, Imbler versus Pachtman, which, I think should

be applied to the situation here.

arrived at this fee of $47,300?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very Well.

Mr. Falk.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME B. FALK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. FALK:

Thar.k you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
This case is

:x

a somewhat curious posture,

When

we received Petit::•.• ns:cru opening briefs, it struck un that
their quarrel on the merits of this case was with the District
Court's opinion and not so much with us.
We had gone tc court to obtain protection against

19

further searches of a newspaper in situations where a subpoena
would suffice.
Petitioners, in their brief, barely touch upon
this aspect of the case with its First Amendment overtones
and aim their cannons at \:he District Court's opinion which
they perceive to create a rather broad par se rule barring
third party searches in all cases of all sorts of people.
We dealt with those problems in the practical

law

enforcement kinds of problems which they perceived to arise
from that opinion in our reply brief in which we suggested
that the power of the police to search non-press third parties
is at least subject to the rule of overall reasonableness and
that five factors, which we summarized on page 41 of our
brief made this, search in this cases unreasonable cn these
facts as demonstrated to the Magistrate.
QUESTION:

What should a. police officer do in the

Ninth Circuit after affirmance of the District Court's
opinion?
MR. FALKs

Well, I concede that the District

Court's opinion, you know, which this Court has before it
stated a broader rule than we advocate as governing this case.
■'JESTIONs

Kail

that was not my question.

My

question is, what should a police officer do in light of what
has happened in the Ninth Circuit?
MR. FALK:

Well, he must present, in the light of

20
what has happened —QUESTIONs

In any third party search, he must con­

form with the District Court's opinion which was affirmed by
the Ninth Circuit?
MR, FALK?

Well, he must at this time. Your Honor,

QUESTION:

How are we to determine or, more appro­

yes „

priately, how is a police officer to determine when it is a
third party search and when it is a criminal suspect search?
Neither party, as I recall, cites the Koffa against the
United States in its brie £ but there is language in Hoffa that
says that the police are not required to guess at .their peril
the precise moment, at which they have probable cause to arrest
a suspect, risking a violation of Fourth Amendment if they
guessed wrong.
MR. FALK:

I think the question you asked me,

Mr. Justice Relinquist, goes to the difference between the for­
mulation of the District Court which I concede is Somewhat
broader than ours and our position is set forth in part two
of our brief.
What we say is that the subpoena — and what the
Solicitor General's brief calls the "subpoena first rule" —
what we say is that that applies where the evidence submitted
by the police to the Magistrate affirmatively shows that the
person is a non-suspect.

21
I-efe me just give a couple of examples that I think
will bring this into focus beyond this case.

Plainly, the

evidence in this case showed that the evidence submitted to
the Magistrate in this case showed that the

Dal ly

had this evidence by virtue of the fact that it was a neutral
party gathering —
QUESTION:

Those are easy cases.

Supposing the

affidavit shows that there is reason to believe that there is
secreted on the premises of the Stanford Daily 500 pounds of
marijuana?
MR. FALK:

I think that is an easy case as well and

it goes in the other diraction because the possession of mari­
juana itself is a crime.

Noone could be a non-suspect, I

think, in possession of a quantity of marijuana.
QUESTION: Even though there is nothing in the
affidavit that suggests that there is any knowledge on the
part cf any Daily employee.
MR. FALK:

I think so and I think that — I think

further that may not give sufficient evidence for a conviction,
i' ydj

•!
f tf' f

It certainly raises the inference that someone in possession
and control of those premises has knowledge that a. crime is

I think realty that what you indicated

is the easy case is the typical case.

MR. FALK:

My bottom line is that they both have

the same right to be free of entry in' this kind of a situa­
tion but the analysis has to be different because the First
Amendment re quires a stricter scrutiny of the process than
would be applicable to an ordinary business, which a bank is..
So my answer is that there are different analyses
that are applicable.

May I ask you this question —

MR. FALK:

Of course they would not destroy evi­

dence of that nature.
QUESTION:

Let us assume you had a picture of the

commission of a' crime.

For example, in banks they take pic­

tures regularly of, not only of robbery but of murder commit­
ted in a bank and there have been pictures taken of the ac­
tual pulling of the trigger or the pointing of the gun and
pulling of the trigger.

There is a very famous one related to

the assassination of President Kennedy.
What would the policy of the Stanford Daily be
with respect to that?

Would it feel free to destroy it at

any time before a exit poet) a had been served?

MR. FALK:

concern to which this editorial statement was addressed was
the concern that their files would be routinely taken advan­
tage of by many people, including but not limited to the
police.

have also subpoenaed the press.

these people who wrote that editorial, "Do not wait for a

MR. FALK:

I do not understand --

QUESTION:

Do you think that that editorial would

lead a reasonable man to believe that maybe a search warrant,
a summary procedure was essential to gat the evidence?
HR. FALK:

We3.1, I understand that both subpoenas

and search warrants are summary procedures in the sense that
both can be obtained very quickly. • Both are obtained ex

take effect the moment that they are served.

43
QUESTION:

Judge Peekham said he was in good faith,

MR. FALK:

He did.

did he not?
He said he was in good faith

and we have never contended otherwise but the point is that on
this record, that is all that was before the Magistrate and
I think that that is all that there could ever have been be­
fore the Magistrate in almost any newspaper search that one
can imagine.

If there ever is a case in which there is reason

to believe that the newspaper would destroy the evidence, the
rule cf the court below would permit a search warrant to issue
and we have no quarrel with that.
I want to stress that although the conceptual
issues that have been discussed this afternoon are
at the core cf this case are law enforcement problems that do
not exist.

They do not exist.
There are pro!lems — I concede that there are

problems

Someone subjected to a subpoena

has several, usually several days to respond.

He

can argue whether he had custody of the stuff that was sub­

MR. FALK:

I think there are two answers to that.

At least in California, subpoenaes can be made returnable on
extraordinarily short notice, the next day, if that is appro­
priate .
Secondly, if there is a motion of some kind to
quash the subpoena., there really are only two possibilities,■
it seems to me

One-is that the motion 13 not well-taken

and surely courts are able to deal with that situs to

by

summarily denying them if there is a situation of urgency.
If the motion is well-taken and there

I grant that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

out I would respectfully say that if that — if there is that
kind of a case, whifch ultimately this Court found it appropri­
ate to review, it would be inappropriate to render that moot

Yes;.

MR. COLLINS:

A subpoena.

They cannot be obtained.

Now, 'that is a. fact on which I can assure you I am correct.
The grand jury does not sit as do the federal’s
and I noticed the United States in their briefs do not concede
this point.

They bring to your attention the fact -it will

hurt them.

Their grand juries, even, do not sit but once

every sixty days in the Middle West or the Rockies or whereever it was they cited.

I cannot remember.

Ours cover 3.0 percent of the total cases in our
state.
