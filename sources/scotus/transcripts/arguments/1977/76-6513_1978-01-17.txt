ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. FRED HOEFLE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOEFLEs

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court::
Before commencing with th© more formal part: of th©
argument, I think it would bs helpful to.delineate the issues
briefly and to go into the Ohio statute,,

both as the legis­

lative history has developed it and as it is operational
at the present tiros.
The basic issues that w@ see in the challenge of
the constitutionality of the statute are, first, doss the
Ohio statute place unconstitutional limitations upon the
meaningful consideration of mitigating

factors?

Secondly, whether 'She Ohio capital mitigation, set
forth :x,

statute, .is so narrowly circumscribed by the

st&tufcift and„further by the judicial glees put on it by the
Ohio Supreme Court that it precludes consideration of these
•.

: u fc favors :snd therefore iff virtually a mandatory end

therefore unconstitutional capital system?

Finally, does the Ohio statute permit a sentence
or 0w«i requires a daath ssssitn&ca which is grossly dispropor™

4
tionate to ~~ such ;as to violate the Constitution?
And wo claim that ‘iit® answer to those issues is
affirmative in all three ins time as.
The Ohio capital statute presently in effect had its
genesis before the decision of this Court in Furman,» as part,
of an ovar-all of all of Ohio's criminal statutes.

When it

wm first introduced and passed by the Ohio House, it was a
model of constituti one lity as we have coni® to s©s from the
Gregg cases.
included.

It had cp@n»@nde>d, broad mitigating factors

It had jury participation in the sentencing

process guaranteed.

It had a broad roster of aggravating

circumstances and the statutes provided for a bifurcated
proceeding o
While that bill had passed the House and

was

presently •••• or was at that time in the Sea at;® of Ohio, this
Court, decided the Furman case.

And the Ohio Senate felt

required by Furman, due its own legislative service committee's
rsolanroeadafciona which are cited in the amicus brief, -that to
permit discretion even though there were specific mitigating
factors anumerafcad, to permit any discretion might be to result
in the statute's being declared unconstitutional tinder Furman.
So the final bill, a3 it was passed, retains the
bifurcated proceedings-, retains all of the, I believe, eight
aggravating circumstances.

Then mitigating circurestraces which

war-.a ©p«- .v~@nd©d war-u ^Ximiwisad end hut threes narrow mitigating

5
circumstances w©r© put: into the statute.
Also omitted from the final version was jury partici­
pation in sentencing <,
Wo feel that the Ohio Legislature# as did the
Legislatures in Louisiana and North Carolina# misconstrued
Furmano

They felt# I think# chat Furman was.— stood for the

position that any discretion on the part of sentencing would be
uncons titutional .
In the present statutes, two statutes within the same
group specifically remove discretion from -she trial court in
sentencing»

2929.0 3(E)# which is cited on page 5 of our

brief# indicates that if the court finds that "none of the
mitigating circumstances listed in division (B) ©f 2929»04 of
ths Revised Coda is established by a preponderance of -the
evidence, it shall impose sentence of death on the offendor®
otherwise, it shall impose sentence of life imprisonment on
the offender®”
Now# it's fairly clctar in itself# but; they go on# on
page 6 of our brief ...it is cited# they repeat this? and this is
in 2929.04(B) down at the bottom of the page# where the three
mitigating circumstaces which w© will discuss in a moment
are listed»

Again it states the death penalty is precluded

when# "considering the nature and circumstances of th©
of fens© and th© history# character, and condition of the
offender# on® or more of the following is established by a

6
preponderance of the evidencea"

"Is precluded".

So the

sentencer really has no discretion at all ’under the Ohio
statutes»

If the facts are as found 'ho constitute a mitigating

circumstances, then the offender will live»

If the facts do

not constitute one of the three statutory mitigating factors,
he will die»
s© there is no senfencing discretion whatsoever»
An even more significant change that the Ohio Senate
mad® in the statute, in response to Furman, was th© narrowing
of the mitigating factors»

Th© broad, open-ended mitigating

factor was eliminated and but three remained»

I would dis­

tinguish that from, I believe, eight in Florida and th© ©penended statutes in the Texas and Georgia statutes»
Th© most important of -th© mitigating circumstances,
because it is th® only mitigating circumstance that has anything
at all to do with the personality and th© individual offender,
is th© third»

And that provides that th© death penalty is

precluded if "the offlense was primarily th® product of th©
offender* s psychosis or mental deficiency, though such conditlon
is insufficient i» establish the defense of insanity»**
V.;©11, psychosis, has been defined as a major, severe
form of mental disorder or disease®

That’s Random House

Dictionary's definition? and Webster adds the adjective,
"profound mental disease**.
So either a person who is —

7
QUESTION s

How does that, compare with the American

Paychi&trie Association definition?
MR» HOEFLE:
Your Honor»

On psychosis, 1 believe it's close,

I frankly haven't seen the American Psychiatric

definition of psychosis»

I believe that is fairly close»

At any rata, I think it is sever© — in nxy collage
psychology course it said the way to distinguish a psychotic
is h® has to go to the hospital, and a neurotic need not»
That, may be a lay definition or a. distinction»
[Laughter»3
MR. HOEFLE;

But tht-s mental deficiency is the key,

because that is not defined in the statute, but the Ohio
Supreme Court has construed it.

And they have construed it

as being equivalent to mental retardation.

This was in their

first pttstr*Fjaym»n capital caso, S •’„t,e. ve» Bay less.

They cited

two medical dictionaries, case law, and the court psychiatrist
in that particular case.

Th@ medical dictionaries they cits

indicato», to furthar characterize what retardation is, is that
a moron is the highest retard in intelligence and an idiot
is -the lowest, and an imbecile is in between.
The authorities, the psychiatric authorities cited
in our brief, indicate that a moron is someone with an I.Q,
of 70 or less, a mental age of 12 or less, and the other two
are below that.
Therefore, under tho Ohio statute, under this third

8
mitigating circumstance, the only on® dealing with the off@nd.ar
hlmsalf, only a psychotic., & moron, an imbecile or an idiot
has a reasonable chsnc© of surviving the sentencing process«,
And then only if that condition, that mental condition caused
the offense.
The oth$r statutory factors —
QUESTION:

That's a fact finding, isn't it?

MR. HOEPLEs

That is, it is strictly fact finding,

yes, sir.

And that is fact finding by the trial judge or the

three, if it went to a three-judge panel as w© did, then the
three judges decide, and they must unanimously find that non©
of the circumstances are present before they can sentence a
man to death»

If one of th© judges finds a circumstance

present, then th© sentence is life, ©van though the other two
may feel that th© d&ath penalty is warranted.
The first of those three mitigating circumstances,

mi it appears in th© statute, is victim inducement.
victim induced or facilitated his own death.

That the

If -lixis can b@

shown to a preponderance, than the offender will escape with
his lifts.
However, we must remember that we* re talking about
an aggravated murder situation, not all taking of life is
aggravated murder.

One of th® aggravating circumstances must;

be present.
Th© only one that I could conceive would foa murder for

9
hire.

But: that: would involve th® victim hiring his own killer.-,

And I suppos® if a case like that ever comes along, perhaps the
victim inducement mitigation will have some significance.
w@ fael that it's basically illusory.

But

Although th@r@ was one

Northern Ohio appellata cas© where the court did find victim
inducement, where the victim was armed and involved in a
narcotics purchase.
However, -that unreportad appellate case added another
element, They said that th® only tin© you can even consider
using victim inducement as mitigation is if the victim himself
is acting unlawfully,

.And that condition is not even in th©

statute.
The final mitigating circumstance is that it is
unlikely that the offense would have been committed but. for th©
fact that the offender was under duress, coercion or strong
provocation.

Duress and coercion, though, has been interpreted

in Ohio’s capital context by -die Ohio Supreme Court? is such
compulsion that will overcome the mind or volition of the
defendant so that h

acted other than h© would ordinarily have

acted in those circumstances.
Which we feel„ at least, blows th© distinction, if
any, between mitigating duress and coercion and the duress and
coercion which is a defense to any crime.
And in our own case they have further blown that
distinction by. applying the doctrine <£ withdrawal.

On page 142

10
of the Appendix, the Court said:

"Ewan if it; were believed

that, appellanti5’ — that’s Bell -- ,sv7&s apprehensive of Hall and
was ’forced* to go along with the crimes, the hard fact, remains
that: appellant: could very easily have quit the schema while
following in another car.M
And in the other case, th© Moods case, that we have
referred to in our brief, the Ohio Supreme Court has, in
discussing the doctrine of withdrawal, withdrawal as applied
•to the defense of duress, really blowed the distinction between
th© ts?©o

There really is no distinction*

If a defendant isn’t

acting of his own free mind or will, then h® is under such
duress or coercion that it makes him not guilty of the offens©
at all, and he won’t even have to worry about getting to a
penalty trial, because he’ll be found not guilty at th® close
of the trial*
Now, it’s important to note her©, extremely important,
that ‘these are three exclusive mitigating factors.

There are

nc other mitigating factors in Ohio, either in the statute
or in the interpretation * There’s a lot of talk about some other
factors in some of the cases.

But there are no other mitigating

factors *
And in ©ur particular case, where we have alleged
several mitigating factors which this Court has held to be
constitvtr©:.&c*»lly srgnific&nt, which we will discuss in a moment,
but basically th©y are th© youth of the offender, his non-

11
participation, in the offense, his cooperation with the polie®,
his drug involvam®at, his ©motional disturbance, his domination
by someone else.

None of these factors were considered, at

least independently.
Th© Ohio Supreme Court said ~~ this is at pag© 141
of the Appendix — "w® will examine each of the three mitigating
circumstances provided for in the statute to determines if the
evidence established that such a mitigating factor existed."
That is the scope of the inquiry in an Ohio penalty
trial.

And that is the only scops.
QUESTION;

Well, if you place very much rest on this

domination of the on© by the stiver, you must also — w® must
also, I suppose — consider that at the time he was arrested,
ho was engaged in tea same kind of an enterprise again? so
you haw) to make-out a case of continuing domination of the on©
by the other, do you not?
MR. HGEPLHs

That’s correct, Your Honor. And we

would point out to th© Court in teat connection that at the time
econd event th<

ext day', the — Hail still had tee

sthogun, h© was still ordering Bell around, as tee testimony
of th© \ 1 trees indicated, Bell was 16 years old, 50-som© miles
away from home, having been driven there by Hall, h© didn't
know when he was.
QUESTIONj
to separate. hims©lf?

No opportunity in that interval of 48 hours

12
MR e HQEFLSs

I would think that the Court might,

reasonably conclude there would have been an opportunity before
the killing of Graber, but afterwards I would say definitely not.u
Ball was still under th® influence of drugs»

Hall drove the

two to Dayton, 'and, ass far as we know, Ball had never been
there.

Hall still had th© shotgun.
The fact is„ I think, that if we’re talking about

strong domination, ‘that’s the kind of — if it's not particularly
strong domination* maybe he would have broken away.

But it’s

strong domination which I think hm been recognised as mitigating,
is th© type of thing which will more ©r less coerce someone
into going along.
The fact remains further, in discussing th® mental
deficiency aspect, as defined by th® Ohio Suprema Court, that
the Court; has had many cases before it where mental problems
hav© been alleged, and in not on© has it reversed th® sentence
of death.

In fact, it —

Yes, air.
Your argument must b© directed only at th©

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD KIRSCHNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KIRSCHNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

th® Court:
I feel that the basic matter that is currently be fora
this Court in so far as the Ball case is concerned, and as I
reflected in my brief, is & cantarpoint between this Court's
decisions in Furman, and this Court's decisions in Woodson.
In Furman, we have unbridled discretion? in Woodson,
wa have no discretion.
Now, if we take th© pronouncements of this Court in
which it is reflected that there should be some discretion
in", that there th© sentence should be tampered and adjusted
as to th® individual defendant, or party charged with an
offense.
Th© Supreme Court, or this Court, I should say,
has reflected that the Court should set forth with some

24
spa ai ficity

th© grounds of th© aggravating

fch® grounds

for th©

mifeigafeing

circumstances

and

circumstances.

I don’t believe that there is any question that th©
aggravating circumstances under Ohio law clearly follows the
decisions of this Court in which the death penalty is pr®~
eluded, except in certain specific instances*

in other words,

you da not get th® death penalty in Ohio for ©vary murder*
It is only where it is a calculated, preconceived thought of
murder, the perpetration of murder, and relative to certain
specific instances, such as th© assassination of fete President,
a person who is incarcerated, where there ar© t&io or more
parsons who

are

supposed to ba killed in mi over-all plot? and

they are specifically ©numerated.

25
And I think that; Ohio fe©k@s and follows the pro­
nouncements of this Court, as set forth in the group of cases
set forth by Gragg and those that followed it, in which th©
Ohio Legislature has set forth a statute whereby they specifically
open the statute with the pronouncement, “regardless of whether

onm or more of ths aggravating circumstances listed in
Division (A)” which is the specific types ©f murder for which
the death penalty can be imposed.

Regardless; that is the

first word,
"Th© death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded
whan, considering the nature® and circumstances of th@ offense
and the history, character, tod condition of the offender, on©
or more of the" items are reflected in the mitigating circum­

Now, the

I find it unusual that

la reading th® briefs and the response —» I apologize for
this expression «*- you're damned if you do, and you’re dawned

But basically it would appear that that is

what the proponents, the petitioners — the abolition of the
death penalty so far as the Ohio statute is concerned — are
presenting to this Court*
With on® hand they -sail us that I am citing unreported

out of the cases of Ohio, the Supreme Court of Ohio, which
the Supremo Court shouldn’t btj saying,

Now, I beliove that this Court is bound to give th©

This Court still has th© final

MR, KIRSCHNER:

If Your Honor please, it is my

But I also v;ould like to,

MR. KIRSCHNER:

Well, I*ra saying .the Ohio —

QUESTIONs Do you want us to ignore the statute? .
MR. KIRSCHNER:

Yss, Your Honor.

Because to© Ohio

Supreme Court ignores it.
QUESTION;

Now, how in the world — oh, I didn't

so® that they had ignored it there, they said it had never
been amended* or changed.
MR. KIRSCHNER;

No, they said that to© Ohio Supreme

Court has never modified this position and pronounced it.
In other words, I am speaking ~~ to© Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals, in toe case of

ton vs. Sun Life Insurance.

QUESTION; Well, do we have to follow to© Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals* interpretation, of Ohio laws too,
while we're at it?
MR* KIRSCHNER;

Mo, Your Honor.

What I am trying

to present to tola Court is the fact that Ohio has a statute
which says;

unreporfcad decisions ar© not binding on tih© courts.

Now, in interpreting that statute, to© Ohio Supreme
Court has said that although it is not binding, on the courts,
it does have m influence in interpretation of the law, as
pronounced by a court for other courts to follow.

And I

submit that, in Ohio there ere numerous occasions in which the
Ohio Supreme Court, where there has been a contrary opinion
coining up from two different, districte, unreported cases are

30

accepted, and this rule is followed more in. its breach than
in its actual quotations by the Ohio Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

We would agree, wouldn’t we, Mr, Kirschnejc,

that a decision or opinion of an Ohio Court of Appeals, whether
or not reported, even though fully reported, -MR. KIRSCHNERs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

~~ is certainly not binding on th©

Supreme Court of Ohio?
MR. KIRSCHNER:

Th© opinion of a Court of Appeals of

Ohio is definitely not binding on the Supreme Court of Ohio,
and I would go on© step further, it is not binding on any
other, as you mentioned previously, Ohio is divided up into
districts, —
QUESTION: Righto
MR. KIRSCHNER;
QUESTION:

• •— but it does have, in so far as —

It; may have

MR. KIRSCHNER:

may b® an- influences,

—- other courts, a great amount

of influence, and it does have soma influence in presenting
an issue never previously decided by the Supreme Court of
Ohio, for which that court has not modified by some other
decision.
So that it doag haves influence, although it may not
bis binding ea that court.
QUESTION:

Ohio’s judicial system, in short — and

I’m now advised it hasn’t berm changed —

31
MR* KIRSCHNERs
QUESTIONs

No, sir»

-- it's almost; an exact analog of th®

federal judicial system0
MR* KIRSCHNERs

Yes, sir*

Now, in the case of Weind vs, state, which subse­
quently appears in th© Ohio Supreme Court, that Court of
Appeals — and, as I say, it is not binding on th® court, but
I would like to just gives this interpretation, if I may*
Referring to She mitigating circumstances involved, th© Court
held, and this is Judge McCom&dc of that district who,
counsel in their brief reflected, said that th® Ohio statute

is mandatory, in considering this mitigating circumstance
relative

to th© offender*s psychosis or mental deficiency,

they said, and X quote, "In considering this mitigating the
circumstances, the court is instructed to consider th© nature
and circumstaneoss of the offers® and th© history, character,
and condition ©f th© offender*

This permits, if not instructs,

■the court to consider such factors as prior history of criminal
activity, the amount of participation by the defendant when
accomplished by another person, th© youth of th© defendant at
the time of the crime, as well as th© mental and physical
.condition of th© defendant*N
to, I ©ay that th© Ohio courts are giving a broad
rsng© of in feirp rotation to >h.i.& ete/feuis, and they &r© following
th® Supreme Court pronouncement*

32
QUESTION: Excusa me for intes.rrupti.Jig, but; may I ask
you a question along th© line of your argument?

State v.

Bay lass , the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio undertook
to define mental deficiency*»
Has there been any more recent definition of mental
deficiency by your court, or is that th© defini id on that you
consider binding?
MR.. KIR3CHNER:

I would say that th© interpretation,

reading all of the cases and putting them all together, mental
deficiency reflects the connotation of th© entire background,
not arising to that criteria or weight, it would be a defense
to the crime itself.
QUESTION?

Is there a more recent case than Bayless?

That specifically undertakes -So define mental deficiency?
X have in mind th© :as© ~~
MR, KIRSCHNER:

At d.ie moment, to b© quite honest

with Your Honor, I do not know, I think there is, but I cannot
specifically quote the expanded version of that definition»
QUESTION:

In Bay lacs, as I read it, mental deficiency

is defined to mean, normal or subnormal, whether it's normal
or subnormal intelligence.

And I ask you now, does Ohio have

laws that limit the age at which minors may marry?
MR. KIRSCHNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: What age is that?
MR. KIRSCHNER:

I believe it’s 18 now, except that

33
they may gat permission of the juvenile court or the probat®
court, X think it’s either 14 ox 16? but X do not know.

The

18 is th© ag-s of consent in Ohio, though»
QUESTION: Do©s Ohio h&v© & law that invalidates
contracts mad® by minora? if so, at what &g@?
MR» KIRSCHNER:

Ohio has a law that invalidates

certain contractual relations — certain ones — contractual
relationships of minors»

However, Ohio has several laws that

require that minors be responsible for some ©f their tortious
actions civi1ly»
QUESTION:

Are these laws X’ve been talking about

based on the intelligence of the minor or on the assumption
that tine experience of mankind suggests that up until

certain

ag as thore may be a lack of maturity or lack of judgment, or
soma other deficiency that may affect the conduct of the minor?
MR. KIRSCHNER:

I would say that this is a l®gis~

lativ-a determination, in which they have set the cutoff data
at age 18»

They could just as easily have, based on their

legislative det©rminatlon, set it at 17 or ag© 21, which it
was up until a few years ago*

So that 1 would say that -this is

a determination by the legislature which, absent a basis of
discrimination in choosing that age, is for the Legislature to
dstarmism, and 'that was the ag© that they picked, was 18«
QUESTION:

Well, granted there’s a certain amount el

arbitrariness in selecting these ages, the point I am making.

34
or asking you about; is whethar or not they relate to th© 10Qo
of tii© individual at the time of the act in question?
MR. KIRSCHNER:

I would say this hers, that the

Legislature has picked an ags, considering many factors.
There are many people above that capability who are stabs tanfcially below that age group? there are many people who are
below it, who are# age-wise, above that age group the Lsgis~
latur© has picked.
QUESTION; Do you think it is too high?
MR. KIRSCIHNER;

I am trying to respond to your

answer, that X don’t think that there is a definite fixed thing
by the Legislature saying age .18, I don’t think that means that
if you*y© under 18 you don’t ha.vs th© sensm to do anything and
you’re not bound by anything you do, and if you’re over 18 you
have got; all tho sens© that you need and we're not going to
consider any maatal deficiencies.

I think each individual case

must be taken in its entirety, and I think that th© Ohio
simtufco reflects that it is being taken in. its entirety, and
th© Supreme Court in this cast- so reflected in considering ago,
as to whether the ago in effect affects th© parson’s mental
ability, mental psychocis, mental deficiency. In soma people
it doss, in soma people it doesn’t.
QUESTION; But no consideration of maturity or judgment;
or perceptibility to th® influence of others?
MR. KIRSCHNER; Well, —

QUESTION: That’s what, your court has said in effect,
as I reus'd Bay l«sss » which ends up defining mental deficiency as
subnormal intelligence.

No, I —

You know, you can be 15 years old and
But your judgment might not h@ vary

MR, KIRSCIINER:
have gone to that extent.

I don’t think that til® Ohio courts
I ‘'chink that they have reflected
*

this in this

Ball css®.

For one, they1 re saying that you take

the nature and circumstance of the offense; the character,
history of th® defendant himself, in going into that total
picture. And I don’t think that th® courts' in Ohio are
restricting ths matter to th© fine legal definitions, because
if it was restricted to th© fine legal definitions, then,
under those circumstances you would have th© defense to th©
crime Itself; and Ohio specifically held that they are not
going to hold the person to the seme weight or totality of the
evidence as they would in a deafens© to the basic crime
itself.
And this has been pronounced several times in their
opinion

MR. KIRSCHNER;
QUESTION;

Well, this was —

— if tlier® were & case in which there

could be no conviction because, either of duress or insanity,
tiie insanity of th® defendant or th© duress upon the defendant,
then there would b® no death sentone® for this statute to

MR. KIRSCHNER: That is correct, except that is on®
of the arguments which counsel for th® petitioners have raised
in their brief, by saying that there is no basic difference
batween this basic defense itself ©ad th® mitigating factors.
Lxid as I said at the outset, you’re damned if you
do and you’re damned if you don’t.

And I submit further proof

cl that, and I quote from the brief of the respondeat in this
matter, at peg® 11«,
There was recently another aggravated murder ces-a
in Hamilton County, in which a person was charged with the
crime, he was an accomplice, fee was not th® basic perpetrator.

37

they w©r®. claiming duress, they were claiming youth, they were
claiming undue influence»
Counsel, I am certain, is better able to tell you
everything they were claiming, because it so happens the same
counsel that is sitting before this Court today was counsel in
that case»
QUESTION: That’s the Ervin case?
MR* KIRSCHNERs

That’s the Ervin case, Your Honor»

And in the Ervin case, which was in Common Pleas Court,
and which is not, shall we say, binding on any other court than
that court, but it is of some advisory»

The Common Pleas

Court went beyond what we believe the statuta reflects, and
they held hi at all of these matters are taken into considera­
tion. — referring to accomplice, referring to age, referring
to duress., referring to coercion, and everything else -- and
%

I quote:
'’All of these matter’s were taken into consideration
and ©new you take all of these into consideration, the death
penalty is precluded if these three things are there*

But

still the <srial court has discretion, as to whether or not the
death penalty should be pronounced»M
And I think that's what the Legislature intended
v?h@n they used th® word ”regardless" as th© pralud© to Section
(B) of the death penalty sentence»
And he went on to make his determination based (1)

38

cm th© facts that: this was an accomplice and th© fact that: the
person might h&v<& been influenced, his ags, his cooperation
with th© police, et cetera, et. cetera, which are not specifically
reflected in th© three .1 tarns, but are in the totality of
nature and consideration»
And then we have this statement, with a judge who is
doing exactly what defense counsel is asking, or petitioner
is asking tills Court; tso do, and I quote his statement, page 11
of his brief:
f’Thu., Ervin decision, to th© extent that it represents
tin® law of Ohio, incurably infects Ohio capital procedure with
the arbitrary and capricious discretion to impose the death
penalty condemned in Furman vsu Georgia»"
And I think that is exactly what w© are trying to say
her©»

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. FRED HOEFLE ESQ.y
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOEFLE:

Yes, Your Honor; thank you.

Mr. Chief Justic®, may it pleas© the Courts
In Mr. Kirschner's argument, Justice Powell asked a
question regarding the definition of mental deficiency and
whether or not that had been changed.
On pages 23 and 24 of our brief, w© cite all of the
Ohio Supreme Court cases to date involving allegations of
mental deficiency.

The Bay less case explicitly limited mental

deficiency to retardation or Low intelligence, and excluded
« notional, c irfc:iral or behavioral abnormalities.
QU.USTIONs Vfh&t* page did you say?
MR. IIOEFLS:

Pages 23 and 24.

The Hargis case explicitly holds that a 17-year- aid
sociopath is not considered psychotic or mentally deficient
uriifer the statute.
The Roys tar case refused to equate I.Q. with sisitd
d ifialsu::,cy, and held that there was no mental deficiency in the
c«oa of a defendant whose I.Q. was 75 in 1962, 61 in 1966,
and 54 in 1968

46

The teaxda cas® explicitly holds that educational
deficiency does act equal a xncantal deficiency; and finally, in
our casa tine court found no irwsntal deficiency, even though th©
defendant was 16.

At that tin® considered emotionally immature,

not only ms an adult by adult standards, but on & peer group
standard he was lass mature than th© average 16-y©ar“old.
Ha was on drugs for a daily basis, on a daily basis for thre©
years, up until th© day he was arrested.

warranted under the statute in taking age into consideration
in determining a person's mentality?
MR. HOEPLE;

deficiency as I*ve given it, Your Honor, because -QUESTION;

Well, X didnTt ~~ you raight not even --

if someone wants to srgu© that; because a person is young it's
more likely that he isn't mentally competent? is that kind of
