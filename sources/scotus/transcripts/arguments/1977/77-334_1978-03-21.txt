MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-334, First Federal Savings and Loan Association v.
State Tax Commission.
Mr. Howe, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHESTER M. HOWE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HOWE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
We start with the uncontested proposition that
federal savings and loan associations are federal instrumen­
talities.

As such, they may be taxed only as Congress

authorises us.

The Congressional authorization appears in

Title 12, U.S.C., section 1465(h).
QUESTION: . What- you really mean is federal instru­
mentalities for that limited purpose, they are not federal
instrumentalities in the use of that term as it is used under
the Federal Tort Claims Act, for example?
MR. HOWE:

They are, as that phrase is used, I be­

lieve, in the national banking cases.
QUESTION:

It is a narrow instrumentality, not a

MR. HOWE:

I would agree with that, Your Honor.

broad one?

The congressional authorization appears in section
1464 (h) and it provides in pertinent part that no stat<j shall

impose any tax on federal associations or their franchise,
capital, reserves, surplus, loans, or income greater than that
imposed on similar local mutual or cooperative thrift and
hone financing institutions.
This is a case of first impression which should de­
termine the extent to which Congress has authorized state
taxation of federal associations.
In 1966, Massachusetts elected to tax federal asso­
ciations.

The tax as imposed by measured by a deposit element

and by an income element.

The statute is now challenged on

the grounds that it conflicts with 1464(h) because it discrim­
inates against federal associations and also because it
violates federal constitutional provisions.
I propose to address four issues presented in our
brief.

The first is that the state statute exempts entirely

all Massachusetts credit unions from the tax.

The exemption

is discriminatory if state credit unions are similar to
federal associations within the meaning of 1464(h).

The

largest credit unions in. Massachusetts are functionally
similar though not identical in both powers and purposes and
in operations of federal associations.
The next two issues which I would like to address is
whether the tax is a franchise tax or -whether the commerce
clause is violated.

Both arise from one statutory defect, and

that is that the statute has no apportionment provision.

As a

5
result, all income earner catsMo of Massachusetts by federal
associations is taxed by the commonwealth.

Federal associa­

tions had earned during the years that we have statistics
about a third of their income from states other than
Massachusetts.

The associations are a part of a national

housing program and necessarily do a large out-of-state busi­
ness.

Other states provide a variety of benefits upon federal

associations through their recording facilities and in other
ways.
The statute makes no attempt to exclude from the tax
bass the benefits conferred by the other states.

By defini­

tion, a franchise tax measures only the value of the benefits
conferred by the taxing state.
that.

Massachusetts goes beyond

It fails to limit its tax base in any way.
The commerce clause parallels the franchise tax

issue.

Again, no apportionment is provided for income earned

outside the commonwealth.

The risk here is one of double

taxation on the federal associations which ought to be pro­
hibited by the commerce clause.
•The final and perhaps most important issue is that
the state court found that the income measure of the tar;
discriminates against federal associations.

The discrimina­

tion is caused by the deduction from income for required addi­
tions to surplus.
requirement.

All thrift institutions have that kind of

The terminology may vary from institution to

6

institution, but they aro calleo guaranteed funds, surplus,
r

something equivalent to that.
The state court finding of discrimination is clearly

accurate, it should be dispositive of the case; however, the
state court excused the discrimination on the grounds that its
source was the federal regulatory agency which regulates the
amount of the reserve requirements of federal associations.
The court also said that the associations had failed
to show a competitive, a substantial competitive disadvantage.
Neither justification is valid.
This case arises as a result of a declaratory judg­
ment by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
consists of

stipulated facts in an affidavit.

The record
The court up­

held the state statute against all challenges presented.

It

was the second time that the state statute had been before a
court.
In 1373, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
held the deposits element of the tax to be invalid as against
the federal associations on the grounds that it was discrimina­
tory against them under 1464(h).

The basis of the holding was

that in general the mortgage deduction loans which were a
deduction from the deposits element were applicable solely to
the state institutions.

Out-of-state loans were not deductible

and the greatest impact of that limitation was against the
federal associations.

7
The Court of Appeals abstained from adjudicating
the income element of the tax on the grounds of comity, in­
dicating that there was an adequate remedy in the state court.
Beginning with the credit union issue, the state
court found that credit unions are in fact mutual thrift and
home financing institutions.
were not similar.

However, it concluded that they

The court said, "The test for similarity

is not what each type of institution might do but rather what
each does in fact."

The association so urged that the standard adopted
\

is erroneous.

The test is otherwise in other tax cases.

Since 1935, this Court’s leading decision in Morrissey v.
Commissioner, the character of an institution has been deter­
mined by its powers, not by what it does in fact, but by what
it might do.

The basis of the holding is that an institution

may exercise the powers granted to it fully at any time.
In the national bank taxing cases involving a statute
related to 1464(h), the test is also based upon powers.

For

example, in the Mercantile Bank of New York case, the sole
emphasis for testing similarity between New York trust companies
and national banks was the respective powers.
QUESTION;

Could I interrupt you with one question?

MR. HOWE:

Surely.

QUESTIONS

Supposing you had a thousand state savings

and loan institutions and credit unions, all which were taxed

8
at the same rate as the federal, and then the State of
Massachusetts granted an exemption to say two or three in­
stitutions so that they would not be taxing all of the similar
institutions but just 97 percent of them.
them to repeal the tax on the federal?

Would that require

Is there a require­

ment that all similar institutions be taxed?
MR. HOWS:

As I read 1464(h), I would think that

would be the answer, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It just says the rate can’t be higher

than that imposed on other similar local units, and there is a
tax on state savings and loans, and the rate on the federal is
the same.

What is it that says that they must — that every

similar state agency must be subjected to the tax?
MR. HOWE:

Well, if I can try to answer it by assum­

ing that all such institutions, stats institutions that you
axe describing earned exactly the same level of income as did
all federal associations, excepting for the two or three that
are exempt.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HOWE:

The rate of tax in the aggregate on the

state institutions would be lesser perhaps by a relatively
small amount but nevertheless in the aggregate lesser.
QUESTION;

I see.

So you say they have to foe taxed,

all of those that are similar —
MR. HOWERs

That3s correct.

9

Interestingly, the stato court failed to respond to
these precedents and the State Tax to ri..

i.hy

failed to address them.
QUESTION;

So if you prevail in this, the state

could not collect the tax from the federal institutions at
all for the use —
MR. HOWE;

For the years in question, that would be

the answer, Your Honor.

But on that score, I might note that

the federal associations have been challenging the tax from
the outset on the grounds that it is discriminatory.

It

isn't something that comes out of the woodwork late in the day.
Referring to the statutory differences which exist,
they tend to be trivial.

For example, a credit union may

mortgage up to 90 percent of the value on an individual hone,
as compared to 80 percent by an SSL.

A credit union may in*“

vest a total of 80 percent of all of its assets including
surplus in the mortgage field, as compared to 95 percent for
federal associations of deposits only.

So that while the

figures are 15 percent apart, they in fact axe closer.
The maximum loan on an individual residence is
$50,000 for a credit union, whereas it is $55,000 for a
savings and loan association.
QUESTION;

Incidentally, were these similarities, I

gather is what you are arguing, true whan section 11 was
enacted?

That was in 566.

10
MR. BOWER*

There have been continuing changes, Your

Honor, even beginning with —

involved —
QUESTION:

That's all right, don't waste your time

MR. HOWE:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Was it about the same?

MR. HOWE:

About the same, yes.

QUESTION:

So any changes since '66 have paralleled

with it,

one another, have they?
MR. HOWE:

They tended to escalate presumably re­

flecting the fact that everything costs more.
QUESTION:

To the same degree for each?

MR. HOWE:

If you are asking that in terms of per­

centages, I am not able to answer the question. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Amounts.

MR. HOWE:

If I may answer it in terras of comparability,

yes, but not by dollar amounts.
QUESTION:

I take it that withdrawals, there being a

great deal less liquidity in the employees’ association, what
did you —
MR. HOWE:

The credit union?

QUESTION:

— the credit union, the typical credit

union is not intended to have the kind of liquidity that a
federal savings and loan has?
MR. HOWE:

I am not sure if I understand the term
1

"liquidity. "
QUESTION:

If they invest 95 percent of their assets

in mortgages, they aren’t going to be able to respond to their
depositors very rapidly, are they?
MR. HOWE:

The federal associations, Your Honor, the

95 percent applies to federal associations.

There is, however,

a regular —
QUESTION:

There is a waiting period for withdrawals,

isn’t there, on all of them?
MR. HOWE:

Generally speaking, 90 days.

As far as

the SSL’s are concerned, however, there is a liquidity re­
quirement independent which is not in any way incorporated into
the tax statute.
The state court in fact did note that there were
statutory differences and commented that the primary area was
in the details of the loans that might be made and in the

lending powers.

Beyond that, it made

larger credit unions, the percentage of mortgage loans made
begins to approximate the percentage of the loans made by
federal associations.

There were 99 credit unions with over

$2 million in assets each in 1973, and that $2 million figure
is important because the powers of credit unions are scaled
according to their sise.

At the $2 million level, the powers

that I have been addressing are with the credit unions.

Below

that, the loan provisions are lesser.
Of the 99, that group invested $330 million of their
assets in mortgage loans.

Twenty of that group had more than

50 percent and 10 of that group had over 60 percent of their
assets in mortgage loans.
The major difference which exists between the two
kinds of entities is -the federal associations invest almost
exclusively in mortgage loans? whereas credit unions do a sub"
stantial personal loan business.

They invested approximately

43 percent of their assets in personal loans; nevertheless,
other conceivably similar institutions invest substantial por­
tions of their assets in non-real estate loans.

And by way of

example, the state savings banks in 1972 invested over 35 per­
cent of their assets in corporate securities, a power which
the federal associations do not have.

State savings banks are

conceded to be similar.
In considering this question of similarity, it should

13
be remembered that dif

similarities can
Similarity denotes difference, a

without differences there would be identity, if we don't have
differences we would cither 'nave only oral it unions or only
federal savings and loan associations.
The state courts which have considered this issue in
tha past have failed to recognise that simple proposition.
They have universally permitted very minimal differences to
be the basis for the exemption of credit unions.
Unlike the state court# the Tax Commission empha­
sises differences in lending powers to support the finding of
dissimilarity.

To proper assess this contention# it should be

remembered that Congress intended to protect federal associa­
tions from discriminatory tax treatment.

If a state institu­

tion has powers greater than those of the federal associations#
the local institution has an advantage# an economic advantage.
The broader lending powers conferred upon the credit
unions provide than with that kind of advantage? adding tax
exemption adds to their competitive advantage.

In substance#

the Tax Commission would have the Court believe that the credit
union# with over $65 million in assets# with larger investment
powers# needs special protection by way of tax exemption.
Stating the proposition demonstrates its invalidity.
Both the State Tax Commission and the state court
also assert that the preference for personal loans

do not have, and in any event it is not restrictive.

it
'jitions
Any

credit union which invests in accordance with its tatutory
powers — that is, for example, up to the. 8 0 percent on mort­
gage loans — cannot validly be criticized.

The Commission

cites no case or regulatory proceeding to show that the statu­
tory language regarding personal loans has ever been enforced.
That fact in itself indicates that there is no validity in
the distinction.
QUESTION:

Whose burden is it to show whether that

language in a conceivably existing statute or regulation has
been enforced, on the person seeking to sustain the validity
of the tax or on the person who seeks to invalidate the tax?
MR. HOWE:

Proof

of a negative seems to be some­

what difficult, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. HOWEs

Yes.
I haven’t found one, and that may fo©

simply inadequacy, but absent that I don’t know what kind of
proof might exist.

Presumably the state would have better

records than, at least in the regulatory area than would be
available to us.
QUESTION:

But it is your view that burden should be

on the state and not on you?
MR. HOWE:

If they have that data, yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

It does not tax federal credit unions?

MR. HOWEs

That’s correct, Your Honor.

It makes a

great point of that at one point in their brief, and I would
like to address that.
One other point on the standard of proof that the
state court imposed on us with respect to credit unions.

They

required proof of competition for the same kinds of investors
and borrowers, without indicating the character of the proof
that 'tight be required.

It seems to us that the proof

obviously must be made on the basis of class, based upon
purposes and powers.

It cannot require an individual survey

whatever.

It seems to me that it would have to be and

typically has been in the national banking cases on the basis
of what the institution is designed to do.

And in that regard

both entities have similarly insured deposits levels and the
mortgage lending powers we have already discussed.
Here again, if the investors and borrowers are dif­
ferent for the two classes of entities, the state court and
the State Tax Commission have failed to show what those dif­
ferences may be.
QUESTION:

And you say again the burden of proof is

on than rather than on you?
MR. HOWE:
Honor.

No, I don't say that precisely, Your

I say that from our point of view- the standard which

we are employing, that is o£ powers arid purposes, where the
i

deposit levels generally are $33,000 in the one instance and
going up to $66,000 for a joint account, versus the $40,000
level of insured deposits for federal associations, are so
comparable as to incline toward the same type of depositor.

clusion is incorrect, the state hasn't brought it forward.

.ors and purposes indicate that the classes

are identical because of the similarity.

If there is proof

•that that proposition is incorrect, it has not cone forward,
and that burden rests on the state.
Regarding the legislative history, the State Tax
Commi.ssion relied heavily on the fact that the federal taxing
policy

toward

position.

federal and state credit unions supports their

We believe that the reliance is misplaced and the

reason is that the federal legislation began in 1934.

At

that time, a federal credit union was empowered to make loans
with a maturity of not over two years, and the maximum loan
by a credit union could issue was $200.

In 1951, which is

when federal credit unions became taxable —• excuse me, when
savings and loan associations became taxable under Title 26,
the Internal Revenue Code, the maximum maturity for loans for
federal credit unions was only three years.

The differences

in powers and purposes of the federal credit unions aid federal
savings and loan associations clearly justified the federal
difference in treatment in taxation.
Federal credit unions continue to be exempt from tax
for federal purposes.

States, however, have been empowered to

tax federal credit unions from the outset.

If taxed, however,

they had to be taxed at a rata not greater than that imposed
on local banking institutions.

The fact that Congr

19

federal credit unions with banking institutions establishes
that the federal credit unions were considered to be like
banking institutions and not some unique kind of entity.
The Massachusetts tax policy, on the other hand,
began in 1966, thirty-two years after federal credit unions
were first created.

In doing so, it was obligated in 1966 to

make the comparison between federal sssociations and credit
unions to see whether at that time they were similar.

There

is no point in comparing credit unions as they existed in 1934
and federal associations as they existed in 1966.
Moreover, our view is that 1464 ought to be read to
impose a continuing obligation on states to maintain a nondiscriminatory tax on federal associations.

That is the whole

function of 1464? when compared to all similar institutions.
If a local entity is to have its tax exemption continue, the
exemption must be reexamined each time there is a substantive
change in the powers of either federal associations or the
local entity.

It is not something that can be once looked at

and then forgotten.

An exemption from tax not discriminatory

in its origins may become so over time.
Finally and most importantly —
QUESTION:

may have been a basis for concluding that the state credit
unions were dissimilar and therefore did not have to be taxed

you?
Perhaps the

most important aspect of the statutory history is what
President Carter has asked the Congress to do .

The President

21
has said in his message to the Congress on January 21 of this
year, ’’Credit unions are tax ©tempt, yet their powers and
functions are defined so broadly that the terra "credit union"
can inclii.de financial institutions that are functionally
identical to a savings and loan association.

The tax exemption

provides them with an unfair advantage over their competitors.!
That is precisely what we have been saying since 1966.
The federal statutory and legislative history,
rather than supporting the State Tax Commission, clearly
establishes credit unions to be similar banking institutions,
nearly identical to federal savings arsd loan associations.
There is no justification for the exemption of tax for the
credit unions.
The next two subjects can be handled together, and
briefly, I hope, and they arise because the state statute pro­
vides for no apportionment for income earned outside the
commonwealth.

The failure to apportion is fatal, in our view.

The two simple propositions are presented here, and the first
is definitional.
The state court labeled the tax a franchise tax and,
of course, 1464(h) permits a franchise tax.

The real question

is is it a franchise tax within the meaning of 1464(h), and the
answer, it seems to me, is a clear no.

By definition, a

franchise tax must measure only the value of the privileges
conferred by the taxing state.

Here Massachusetts taxes the

22
entire value of the federal franchise, without regard to the
benefits conferred by other states, and the other states do
confer substantial benefits.
Federal associations are part of the national hous­
ing program.

One of the functions they serve in that is to

put mortgage loans out throughout the nation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. STEPHEN ROSENFELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. ROSENFELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I wish to argue three points on behalf of the Common
wealth this afternoon.

First and primarily, as it turns out,

23

credit unions axe no-;: similar to the appellant associations,
either as the word ,!similar" was intended by Congress in 12
U.S.C., section 1464(h), or under the current facts as pre­
sented in the record in this case.
My second argument will be that the Massachusetts
tax is neutral and fair and nondiscriminatory under the stand­
ards of 12 U.S.C. 1464 (h)? and, finally and briefly, that the
tax does not intrude upon interstate commerce.
For purposes of the whole argument, I wish to empha­
size these elements;

What Massachusetts is attempting to do

with this tax is to have the appellant associations' domicili­
ary corporations contribute their fair share to support the
costs of government.

The acts of Congress which authorize tax

taxation of federal institutions such as this and national
banks plainly support that state tax policy.

Additionally, the

appellants have presented no independent substantive federal
policy which is violated on supremacy clause grounds by the
state tax in question.

Given the fact that Congress and this

Coiirt have accorded state tax policy-making broad discretion,
we believe that the appellant associations come to this appeal
with a heavy burden of persuasion.
I am going to turn initially to the tax treatment of
credit unions which the appellants
oral argument today.

have emphasized in their

The appellants say that by treating

credit unions differently, Massachusetts has violated federal

24
law because in their view credit unions are similar to federal
savings and loan associations as the word "similar" is used in
section 1464(h).

This is not the case, however.

Credit unions are not included in the state tax,
that is true, but they are not similar either as a matter of
congressional intent, the primary standard for this Court, or
as a matter of current actual fact.
Appellant made no argument about congressional intent
at all in the brief they presented to this Court, and they
could not.

The legislative history to the Home Owners'Loan

Act, and it was the Home Owners’ Loan Act that established
savings and loan associations and also enacted 1464 (h), the
federal statute in question ■—• that Federal Home Owners' Loan
Act and the legislative history to it presented in our brief
makes plain that the 73rd Congress did not intend credit
unions to come within the definition of the word "similar."
t

What the Congress had in mind was state savings and
loan associations, state savings banks and state cooperative
banks.

It is interesting to note that the very same Congress

which enacted the Horne Owners? Loan Act was the Congress that
enacted the Federal Credit Union Act creating federal credit
unions for the first time..

The Federal Credit Union Act was

enacted one year later, in 1934.
The Congress which had created savings and loan
associations, one year later, in establishing federal credit

25

unions, established a wholly different, wholly separate
regulatory structure for federal credit unions which differ
significantly from the Federal Home Loan Ban!': Fioard and
federal savings and loansassociations, not assigning its view
that similarity was its view of credit unions.
Finally, in terms of congressional intent, what
Massachusetts has done is tax the franchise of savings and
loan associations and, while not taxing the franchise of credit
unions, folloxvs almost exactly the tax policy that Congress
itself has chosen for purposes of federal income tax.

Congress

has always exempted all credit unions, state and federal, from
the federal income base tax, but has since 1951 imposed a
federal corporate income tax on federal savings and loan asso­
ciations, including appellants.
It would be anomaolous to say that the state is pre­
cluded from adopting the same kind of taxing policy in terras
of supporting its cost that Congress itself has chosen in
imposing the federal income tax.
One additional point, my brother suggested that
federal credit unions were subject to taxation by the states.
In fact, I believe that is not true.

The citation is 12 U.S.C.,

section 1768, and suggests — the language is that federal
credit unions, their property, et cetera, shall be exempt from
all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States or
by any state, territorial or local taxing authority.

It appears

26
clear to P.3 that the Congress views credit anions, federal and
state, as different and subject to different forms of taxation
than federal savings and loan associations.
Turning now to the record in this case and the actual
facts, putting aside for the moment congressional intent, we
believe that appellants have not shown similarity in fact.

In

addressing similarity, we believe it is a comparison between
classes of institutions that should be paramount, rather than
picking a single institution from one class and seeing whether
it may bear some similarity to a single institution from
another class.

And in looking at the classes of institutions

in question, the facts are theses
Credit unions are very small.

They are tightly

limited in their membership by state statute to those who have
a common bond in either employment, affiliation or residence.
They have far less assets than the appellants, and their
/

mandate, their mandate by state statute is to emphasize the
small personal loans to its members.
QUESTION:

What does affiliation mean in the st<

statute?
MR.

ROSENFELD:

It could mean religious affiliation,

club affiliation, and social —•
QUESTION:

Could it just mean affiliation with the

credit union?
MR. ROSENFELD:

No, it could not.

As I sa id, the

27
mandats is to emphasize small personal loans, and it is note­
worthy that this is an activity that is virtually shunned by
the federal associations.

On the other side, GO percent of

the credit unions have no real estate lending activity whatso­
ever.

And as far as tho remaining 40 percent of the credit

unions are concerned, appellants have not shown that their
loans are at all competitive with the federal associations’
much larger and far more pervasive real estate lending activity.
And they couldn’t show competition because the credit union
loans are once again limited to their members.

Credit unions

simply cannot go out on a general market and seek to compete
with other institutions who lack the kind of limits that
credit unions have.

The facts, in short, are against the

arguments that appellants are making, and they do not support
excusing appellants altogether from state tax, as they would
have this Court do.
At bottom, the argument here that appellants present
is one on tax policy.
gested

The fact is, as appellants have sug­

with their statement from President Carter, they said

policy debate that is now going on between the legislative and
executive branches, and Massachusetts believes that this Court
should resist an attempt to draw the judiciary into the debate.
I would like to now turn just briefly, because
appellant has not raised this issue in their oral argument, to
the question of discrimination between federal associations on

the one hand and the state’s treatment of those state entities
which they do tax under section 1464(h).
savings banks and state cooperative banks.

These are state
The question is

whether Massachusetts has unfairly favored local savings in­
stitutions somehow at the expense of the federal associations.
The vital facts are these:

The statute, Mass.

General Laws, Chapter 63, section 11, is neutral on its face.
The rate of the tax is the same for the federal and state in­
stitutions, the types of deductions are identical, and the
appellants offer nothing apart from the face of the statute
to suggest that it was passed, enacted as a hostile or un­
friendly act. towards the federal institution, and these are
the words that this Court has used in assessing the question
of discrimination.
As far as the appellants' factual proof goes, they
have made no showing of discrimination or disproportionate
in result between the taxing of federal and state institutions.
Chiefly, they have made no showing that their actual tax burden
in dollars and cents is any heavier proportionately than the
tax burden of state institutions.

And under the decisions of

this Court, the failure to show a difference in impact, prac­
tical impact on account of the state tax is fatal to their case.
The appellants, while they don't present evidence of
actual tax impact, do present sane evidence about the amount of
their deductions under the state tax as compared with their

29

total assets, and they present ratios comparing the amount of
their deductions wit

tal assets and compare that ratio to

the ratio for state institutions.

Well, that ratio has no

approx ornate relationship to actual tax burden about which the
record is silent.

But even looking at the ratios which are

presented, there is no clear pattern disfavoring the federal
institutions.

What those ratios of federal and state insti­

tutions show is that in some years the state’s institutions did
enjoy a proportionately or comparatively greater deduction
than the federal institutions, but in other years the reverse
is the case.

In three of the years presented by the appellants,

it was the federal institutions which enjoyed a greater ratio,
a greater benefit from the deduction, using the ratio evidence
that they presented and relied on.
Finally, on this question of discrimination, this
Court's decisions undes: section 1464 (h) and the companion pro­
vision permitting state tax on national banks, 12 U.S.C. 548,
this Court’s decisions under both of those sections leave no
doubt in our view that the state tax is valid.

Those decisions

require fairness and even-handedness on the states.

Appellants

have shied away from these principles and instead their argu­
ment demands rigid mathematical equality between state and
federal institutions.
Following their analysis, no deduction which had a
disparate result or even the potential for a disparate result,

30

no matter how small, could stand under the principle of dis­
crimination which they advance.

In oar view, following this

Court's more practical standard of fairness, the appellants'
claim of discrimination falls short.
Finally, I would like to turn to the question of
whether or not the state tax intrudes impermissively on inter­
state commerce under the principles laid down by this Court
under the commerce clause.

We believe that on this issue, the

appellants do not have lav/ c.v evidence on their side.

There

is no direct evidence whatsoever of the extent of income that
the appellants derive from interstate commerce.

The record is

bare on how many borrowers, real estate mortgage borrowers
live out of state, and there is no evidence on how many of
these loans were culminated out of state.
However, wa do know this?

We do know that every one

of the appellants have all their offices in Massachusetts, and
therefore all of the processing of the loans, all of the
monitoring of the loans and all of the receiving of the loans
goes on in Massachusetts.
What we believe the record thus establishes are two
independent bases under fch? commerce clause principles for the
tax that Massachusetts

has imposed.

The first relies on the

fact that Massachusetts is the state of domicile for the
«■

appellant associations, and under this Court's decision a
strong presumption exists in favor of a state's right to demand

I

31

a support and contribution in the costs of government when
that demand is made by the home state of the corporation.
And second, quite apart from domicile, putting domicile aside,
the record shows in this case a close connection between the
taxing state, Massachusetts, and the activities and income
upon which the Massachusetts tax is levied.
As a final point under the commerce clause, appellants
raise the specter of multiple taxation, but they simply have no
foundation in our view for arguing that interstate commerce is
in jeopardy of multiple taxation and the burden that would
flow therefrom.

There is no overlapping tax that exists right

now, and it would be strange, we believe, to strike down this
current justified tax on the basis that in the future some
state with a lesser claim and. a lesser right might impose seme
tax burden or might stake a claim to a tax burden on some
f -

portion of appellant's income.

In our view, this is thin ice

for a constitutional challenge to a state tax, and we believe
therefore for this reason and other reasons that I have pre­
sented, the reasons the commonwealth has presented in its brief,
that the state tax should stand and the judgment of the court
below should be affirmed.
Thank you very much.
