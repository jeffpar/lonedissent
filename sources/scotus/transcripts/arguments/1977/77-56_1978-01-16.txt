MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will fce&r arguments

next: in 77-56, In the matter of Edna Smith,
Mr. McClain, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF RAY McCLAIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. McCLAIN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
I am Ray McClain of Charleston, South Carolina.

I

represent Edna Smith of Columbia, South Carolina, a. member of
the bar of this Court, who is seated to my left this morning.
Miss Smith, is before this Court seeking reversal of
professional disciplinary punishment imposed on her for
advising one Marietta Williams that the services of the American
Civil Liberties Union were definitely available for Mrs.
Williams, with whom she had previously consulted.
Mrs. Williams was a welfare recipient in Aiken, a
. 1 community i.u. South Carolina.

Mrs. Williams had bean

sterilized in early July IS 73 as a condition of her receiving
.••c^atsasmt as a Medicaid patient by a physician in Aiken.
This case presents important questions, both under
the First Amendment and the: dm process clause.

The due process

clausa particularly as -bo the vagueness of the rules prior to
thair construction by the — or, in fact, as constrvrsd by the
crura

alow

4
I shall limit, my Comments her© to those issues
relating to various aspects of the First Amendment concerns
and rely

on the brief as to other due process mat .-s.rs, mil-rs.-j

the Court, has specific questions.
It's our position that this case is squarely controlled
by this Court's opinion in NAACP vs. Dutton, & decision in which
the organizational activities of the American Civil Liberties
Union were expressly referred to, and referred to with
approval.

And that decision, as it has been amplified- in cases

o f Brotherhood of Railroad ^Trainman vs

VireTinia, United Mine

Workers va. Illinois, and -the (hiitad Transportation JUnioa jwb..,
Michigan..
The force of those cases, we submit, has been
augmented also by this Court’s decision last term in Betas vs.
Stafra Bar of Arizcnr.-, V7h«r© the Court extended th© applicable
of those prior associatior.al casas to protect advertising of
the availability and price of legal services.
Bused on J/h-sse prior daclslons,
QUESTION s

Would you suggest that the right to

solicit, face-to-face solicitation is co-exlssnsive with the
right to advertire said announce the fees which, will b© charged
for a particular service?

extent that the same interests of providing information for
informed decision-making by the person to whom th

is direct:",-id,

First; Amendment concerns are equally relevant:,

tile balancing of interests may b® differente
QUESTION:

Well, as solicited, do you suggest that a

face-1»“ face solicitation by a trained lawyer on -Ola one hand
end the. untrained layman, untrained at least in the law,
presents the same kind of arm's length factors as an announcement
in th© paper of Schedule of Fees?
MR. McCLAIN:

Well, in the first place, I think 1

should point out that in this case thsi conduct which is ah ice .-sc.
to be solicitation, the letter which was written by Miss Smith,
was not a face-to-face confrontation of that sort*
QUESTION: I was referring to —relating it; to
ft..: case which we just heard argued.
MR. McCLAIN:
prior

Right.

And with respect to the

1 think that, clearly any time there is a face-to™face

confrontation, th^rs; are other factors operating that are not.
operating in a. written communication,

QUESTION:

Do. you tend to ~~ do you think the

written letter is equated roughly ‘to take annomeemant la the
aswspaper?
MR. Mc.CL.AINs

I think it’s closer to that, certainly,

-than an impersonal solicitation.

is that, it: protects associarion&l activity to initiate litiga­
tion, to support litigation in so far as such litigation, may
further legitimate goals of the organization by assuring meaningful access to th--a courts.

And that 'meaningful access dotas not

of their rights are members of the association or not.
were not in the Button case.

They

Obviously, the information

disseminated in the Bates case was not disseminated to any
particular limited associational group.
And, further, that attorneys may participate in such
organisational and associational activities with similar
First Amendment constitutional protection.
indeed, td.e parallels that this ease presents with
th© Butter-, case are very striking.

A very important activity

of the NAACP in Button was providing legal services.

Th©

Court said it had -an extensive program of providing legal
services to aggrieved parserf in certain types of cases.
That’s similar to :':h© situation here.
The IIAACP limited th© scope at the outsat of its
undertaking rep.resfmt&tlea of anyone, but thereafter exercised
no control over the actual conduct of the litigation.

The

aCiu follows a similar practice*

In Appy ..., ,a.-v

11 cited •: •

‘.ly rai',"v3r aggrsssiv. Ay

m who, according to the opinion in' the Virginia

Supram-p Court, had never ©Kprsased. siy inter-ash in litigating.

had no idea they would be ro®t by an attorney when they went to
various community meetings , and y@fc attorneys war© ther©
participating in the attme&t to persuade people at these
Meetings to join lawsuits, to

t

k practices of segregation.

And those attorneys, in the litigation that follows, were
cofapensatod on something which was not 'the case with respect
to ACLU attorneys.
The matter here, as in Button, was a suit attacking
government practice®» in this case tie provision of Medicaid
services.
QUESTION;

In thi.J case, Mr, McClain, though, your

client pursued a little mora aggressively than in Button,
didn't ehe?

I assn, wasn’t she present at tho initial meting

and then v&s told that if the client wished to employ her
let her know, and than, nonethels
your client followed up with a kind ©'<£ a second solicitation?
MR, McCiAJNs
f'v;f ff'-av: Xmwr*

The record doss not really reflect

Tfea only thing that's clearly reflected by

■■it-3 record is that on® Gary Allan, who had organized the

i

©f thcs letter, Your Honor.

don't agrcua with that characterisation,

I belies® that the record is clear

that Miss Smith wrote a latter,

l do not balisiv© that it c«m

fairly b® characrorJ. zed as an, attempt to persuade her , end la
her testimony sha ixpli.citly stated that she was not try lag
to p@rsuao.S3 anyone — in- fact# Mrs. Williams testified# th©
only evidence that Mrs. Williams# the person allegedly
solicited# had on the question of persuasion was that Edna
Smith had not attempted to persuade or pressure her in any way
to file a lawsuit.
QUESTION; Moll, putting to one side the characterise,tion of the letter, which nay be subject to reasonable inter*»
prat.rfelo: sa on both sid-arj, the follow-up letter is a fact that

wasn't pres-anh in i up «e-., ;! sn* h it?

they read rJboufc them 'in the newspaper.
QUESTI-QH s well f

was there or was • there-, act evidence

of follow-up letters in Button?
MiM McCLlklH::
QUESTION:

To my knowledge, I know of none*

Km, I'm not sure» whether your colloguy

8
with Mr. Justice Rahaquist refers to tha letter which I thought
was the only letter * you read part of it. and —
MR. McCLAIN:
QUESTION:

It is.

—■ she wrote and said, "You will probably

remember me from talking with you at Mr. Allen's office in
July about the sterilisation performed on you.

Th© American

Civil Liberties Union would like to file & lawsuit on your
behalf for money against the doctor": is that the latter v/e’rs
talking about?
MR. McCLAIN: That is the letter that, we*is talking
about- Your Honor. The letter gees on to state in addition
that the — in the next paragraph —* in fact., there in the next,
sentence she said:

“We will be coming to Aiken in the near

future and would like to explain what is involved" — this is
va page 9 of the State’s brief — “so you can understand what
is going a,"
The next, paragraph proposes a magazine interview, if
Mrs. Williams is ii

lie: zing the issue of forced

-i, which Miffs arnii-h makes quite clear iff t;ctelly
up to Mrc- • Williams, whether she would participate in that
practice or not, ia that interview or not.
*'

■■■-'. pff-ff.ffff.b:

And asks, in the.

,r About; bte Iffffvff'ffir, i:§ you err iai

,

let me know” ? tear®5;? really no persuasive content to this
letter.

And,

in

fact, as it was characteri zed by Kiss Smith

in her testimony before the hearing panel, this latter was

essentially an attempt. t» advise- Miss Smith — excuse me,
advise Mrs. Williams tirt tie AChU would in fact give Mrs.
Williams assistance if she wanted it.
Wa have to take into consideration, Your Honor, the
that
fact that Mrs, Williams was relatively uneducated ,/Miss Smith
had perceived her as not being very well informed about her
rights, not understanding tie initial conversation very well,
and this was simply a letter in which there was an attempt
made to be sura Mrs. Willieuss had considered the matter fully
before she decided what, she was going to do,,
Mrs, Williams, shortly thereafter, called Miss Smiths aid, ,:I*m not :f vter?st: in bringing a lawsuit”, and that was
th-i end ©f it,
Mrs o Williams: never mad© any complaint to any agency
that she ha 1 been pressured by Miss Smith, or never complained
in any way about Miss Smith's conduct,
QUESTION:

Mr, McClain, would -the theory of your case

i differ--... , If /our c3lent had been an ACLU lawyer who would
tried the case, had this solicitation been successful?

QUESTION:

- etczel zsi Button on that parricuirr

10

point:?
MR» McCLAIN: Well, I think that this case is lass
extreme than Button»
QUESTION; Right»

Yes,

To carry it on© step further,

assume further that the ACLU lawyer, contrary to its practice,
allowed counsel fco handle damage suibp , which would have bean
this suit, a percentage recovery .as the fee — a percentage
of the recovery as the fee? would that make tills commercial
speech rather than non comma rci©1 speech?
MR. McCLAIN;

I believe, Your Honor, that the

dis ‘tincti on between commercial and noncommercial speech is a
much more narrow one, shah Your Honor’s opinion in the Pittsburgh
Press case, for Example, appears to characteris© commercial
speech as only 'that speech which has no other purpose but
commercial»
QUESTION: Sc gt-m if trears wore an interest, fee
irooresk la xz\& damage recovery, you would not regard that as
comm©rei &1 s pee ch ?
MR. McCLAIN:
speech.

I don’t believe that makes it comma reds!

And that’s true in the — that’s been true in tim
\

pornography and obscenity area, -that’s been true in the —
in many censas before this Court, that there is a financial

read the opinions.

QUESTION :

Mr, McClain, I don't think that die-tincti on

would hold up. Supposing th© letter were writtesn to a, stock­
holder and tiler® was an offer to represent a class of stock­
holders to get a big recovery, and a statement in the letter
that “we won't charge you a dime» it would be free to you” ,
would that be noncommercial solicitation?

MR, McCLAIN: But I think it’s really different,

QUESTION5
for the litigation.

No charge to the person being solicited
Isn't that ~~ what about this case?

It

was contemplated that, they would recover dollars, and that
those dollars would in part go into the coffers of the ACLU,
that’s what the —
MR. McCLAIN:

No, sir, not at the time the letter was

.written I don't believe the record supports that.
QUESTION:;

Suit for damagess it was described as a

suit for damages.

MR. McCLAIN:
QUESTIONS

That's correct.

Money carnages.

MR. McCLAIN s

A suit for money damages ? but that

all would gc to the client.

Nona of that would go to the ACLU,

in any respect»
QUESTIONs t ill;, the — don’t we have to accept that
the Stata Court's view of that matter, that it was contemplated

that a fee would be paid to the

ACLU, and that would faa

dollars.
ME. McCLAIN ;
QUESTION:

The.t might be ordered by the court.

Yes.

Just like the damages would b©

ordered by the court.
MR® McCLAIN i
i-.S'js»

What I would -•* but in a different;

But. fch:;i£. ii'.portcvvi, c r

important factor is thst,

fer example, it;.® record doss not support any notion that Miss

14

Smith knew that the ACLU v-buld ask for attorney's fees ia
coxia©cti.on with any litigation,

Pert of that —

QUESTION:

Isn't that a reasonable inference*.?

QUESTION;

Welly what if she did, what•• would - that

violat©?
MR. McCLAINs Sir?

I’m sorry.

QUESTIONs What if she did?

Then what would that

violate?
MR. McCLAIN;

Well, I’m just making the point, Your

Honor, that the record in this case does not reflect that Mies
Smith was acting in a fashion to get money for the ACLU.
QUESTIONs Well, what if she were?
MR. McCLAIN:
QUESTION:

I think it's protected —
I mean, she was charged with aiding an

corganisation to promote hsr legrl services, or that of her
«
raise some muaey.
MR. McCLAINt Well, one of the things that the State
Court relied on was the possibility of financial benefit to the
ca- animation, making it. a nen-ssxempt organization.
f:\ad that persuasive.

I did not

But that was relied on below.

QUESTION s But I had understood all of this colloquy was
whether this was commercial or noncommercial speech.
-

directed at that.

-

•

15
MR. .McCLAIM 5

I believe that, is she way it started

out, Your Honor»
And X think that brings mo back to a point which X
wanted to make, that th.s court found, as far as this case is
concerned, the ACLU had only entered cases in which substantial
civil liberties questions are involved*

So that with respect

•to the ACLUfs actd.viid.es, wc. are dealing with a situation where,
even if scit® fees might be paid to them eventually, it’s in the
context of substantial civil liberties litigation»
QUESTIONs When you. say substantial civil liberties
libation, what do you raw.un?
MR. McCLAIN:

You mean a constitutional right?

That constitutional or possibly a

statutory right protects these civil liberties —
QUESTION! Well, how does one know the contours of that,
if you include within, it statutory rights?
MR. McCLAIN: Well, for example, the — there ares a
number of stehuixs which are d©@:a>sd to enforce provisions of
the .Bill of Rights ox- interests related to the Bill of Rights»
Certain provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control Act involving
vesdropping, go after the — or are aimed at the
interests that are protest tt

mdiaent.

QUESTION; Whati about a State statute chat gives you a
right of action against someone who deliberately runs you down
in a car for personal damages? is that — that is not a civil
liberties statute?

16

MR. McCLAINs

No, sir.

That's not:.

QUESTION: Well, what's the difference between that:
«tad a sterilization.- which is a bad form of battery, I guess.
MR. McCLAIN: Well, the issue that was raised in. the
litigation which — the related litigation on behalf of other
wbjndn who had been sterilized by this doctor, was whether or
not that violated — making that a condition of receipt, of
gov©mmenha 1 ly supported services violated the Civil Rights
Act,» 1383 and 85»
QUESTION:

I was? under the impression ~ maybe I

have the wrong view of the record -» that this doctor did these
services free at this ~~
MR. McCLAIN:
QUESTION:

That, is not correct:»
That's not, I see.

Ho would do it if

• ht patient would agree to this condition., is that what it
was?
I» McCLAIH: W®1I, thy patients were Medicaid
patients, -*•
QUESTION:

Right.

MR» McCLAIN:

~~ and -:sh© doctor would accept them as

Redicaid patients only if they would accept, st® r£ 11 zafcion.
He in fact — if the patient we:ae able ta pay, he would not
require sterilization after the third pregnancy; but that's
what ha would require with respect to Medicaid patiente.
QUESTION:

Thesy v?era — these were all maternity

17
cases?
MR. McCLAIN:

With respect to this doctor, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

They ware Medicaid cases of pregnant

women, and the expenses were la connection with the birth of
their children;is that it?
MR. McCLAIN:
QUESTION:

That's

ray usiderstending, Your Honor.

And after tfo® second or third — I guess

it was the third child, he said, "No, I won't be your physician,
any more unless you agree to be sterilized”?
MR. McCLAIN:
record.

That's my understanding - of that

I was not involved in that case, myself.
I would simply like to ©mph&siz© that the State
that-the first meeting at which Miss- Smith met with

1:

o Will last: m-js protected, and, in its brief on page 30 ,

it said it was protect yd tc* advise her of her legal rights,
her legal r*medias, and of the availability of the ACLU.
find it difficult to see why a letter to a person who Miss
Smith did not perceive to fully understand her rights, even

t conversation., a single letter, is stripped of all
consi±tuticnal protection once that first concession is made
■>c».v. v-'r:j initial melting w«s a protected meeting.
>

QUESTION: W©I 1, certainly you don't claim feat just

>scause scathing is a letter the writer of it can't be
punished

id all sorts of context.

A blackm&iling 1stter

18
certainly can be punishable undwr the criminal law of any
Stas© constitufion&lly.? can** if be?
MR0 McCLAXN:

That's correct, sir»

But the re would

have to. b® some interest like that.
QUESTION z A letter written by — demanding ransom,
©r —
HR. McCLAXN:

That's correct.

QUESTION $ But just the fact ±t*s a letter doesn't
give it a free ticket constitutionally to go unscathed through
all the criminal statutes. State and federal, of the United
0

States, does if?
MR» McCLAXN:

Jtesf as speech, which is extortion

in nature is not protected at all by the First Amendment*
QUESTION5

And all sorts of speech, isn't if?

Exceptive speech, fraudulent speech. —

ME. HcCLAIN;
QUESTION;

■ te„

~~ blackmailing speech,

HE. McCLAIN :

Agreed. Wo have a© dispute with tfc-at*

QUESTION: That would b3 true also if a coded
classified ad were put in ?hf. paper- in a newspaper, a
legitimate newspaper, forking out tea ad which purported to be;
®n ad for the sal© of a house which, in fact, was, by a pre­
arranged botes,

si

direction for how to pay the ransom in a

kidnapping, that wouldn't. b@ protected, would it, just
because it Was in the newspaper?

19

MR0 McCLMN s

I would hardly think so*

QUESTION:

Ho»

QUESTION:

Mr. McClain, you said you didn't see a

difference between, the oral meeting in July -and th© letter in
August* Exits the oral meeting was advie© on the merits, as I
understand it, and th© August letter was a solicitation after
giving advice on th© merits*

There's at -least a difference,

isn't there?
MR. MoCLAZN*

Well, ¥c-;-.r Honor, the only difference

is advising th© client, a prospective client, that the ACLU
is definitely available to provide counsel -~
QUESTION;

"Would like to bring an action on your

behalf, end. this practice nust stop,: and so forth*

It is —

it was within th® • power of th© court to treat that as a
s7 licitation, I believe•

Wouldn't you agree with that?

You couldn* t say

such a finding was clearly

erroneous*
' *.

ME., McCLAIN:

Or.© of th© problems, Your Honor, is

that solicitation was never defined*
cls-.r *

to what was.

j.

-,.

So I’m not absolutely,

by solicitation,.. it was not £V:
3

r

.

guilty of 2™103(A)*
QUESTION; Bub don't you think it's fair to r-aad that
letter as racommanding -that she file a lawsuit?
MR. McCLAIN;

1 think it could be subject to that

20
iij.t® rp rstafcion,
QUESTIONS

I would think so.

"This practice must;

stop" is what tins letter says,
MR, McCLAIN;

Thais’s an expression of an opinion

about oh© distd.nct: activity —•
QUESTION;

By the author of the letter to the person

who's reading it, yes,
MR, McCLAIN;

It*s a speech activity in commenting

on an, issue of public interest.
QUESTION:

Thane towards the end of the letter, she

said, "Call me after Labor Day. call me collect", and gave her
a telephone number.
MR. McCLAIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Doesn’t that; support the concept of

solicitation in the finding?
MR. McCLAIN:

You have to remember that the letter

also said, "If you are interested, let me know."

It does

not — it dess invite further discussion.
QUESTION:

Well, presumably, by hypothesis, you

wouldn't say in a letfcar, "If you are not interested, let roa
know.”
[Laughter.I
MR. McCLAIN:

No, but it. also did not say, "Please

sign this letter and ratum by return mail and wo will repres-oat you.M

It was c,u. invitation for further discussion wifi:

21

res pact to the conversivtion.
QUESTION s Cor Id X ask you;

What rule was she .found

to h&v© violated?
MR. McCLAIN;

It was 2, Your Honor, DR 2-103(D),

which , as you commented earlier, involves promoting her
activities - and 2-104 (a.) (5) F which 2 never understood.
QUESTIONS

Wall, that isn’t a — do you think that's

The only disciplinary

rule that: talks about what I would think of as solicitation is
DR 2-103(A) e which is the recommending of the employment of
yourself or your associates * And 104(a) which is the acceptance.
The rules that axe clearly involved in Mr. Ohralik's case.
Neither of those rules is involved in this case, and so it’s
hard for me to adroit that this is a solicitation case.

I*m

It; is undisputed that Mtb. Williams, who appellant sought as

requested legal assistance facorn Miss Smith or from any other
person.

Appellant Smith and a Mr. Gary Allen, for the purpose of Hiss
Smith advising certain women about, the sterilization, performad
