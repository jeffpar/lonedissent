ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT KARRIMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES — Resumed
MR. HARRIMANj

Mr. «Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court, ?
At this time I * d like to complete the argument on
the equal protection phase of this case, and get on to the
second question which involves the allegation of a burden on
intersfeat© commerce.
In addition to the exceptions discussed yesterday,
the appellants complain of two others s

on® is that it grants

longer load privileges to the hauling of pulpwood.

Pulpwood

is produced on Wisconsin farms, and this exception bonefits
farmors.
They also complain of a twin trailer allowance in

55-foot lengths for hauling of milk, from the point of
production to the point of first processing. This also
ben®££t® farm®rs.
No^.r': o& thssu exceptions, which l*ve jurfc nser.ti.oned

Which would imply, to tm at least, that a double trailer of

It assumed that, in

talking about not railroad trains —• that there was an element
of danger.
QUESTIONS

So that, if what you say is correct,

and certainly your brother on tie other side agrees with you,
the district court really wrote its opinion under it mis­
apprehension, didn’t it?

This Court has announced different testa in deciding
interstate amaero© questions.

Th© first, cm® is Sm rational

basis test, announced :ln South Carolina _vs. Barnwell, and
which tills Court applies to highway safety cases,

it’s &lao

announced — another test, we call the balancing test., it appears
to have appeared first in e<5i® long train case in Arizona,
Southorn Pacific vs. Arizona, and more recently stated in
Pike vie Bruce Church.
Th® rational bi-sis test has been applied in safety

39

cases , and tea balancing test in other cases*
The question before this Court is whether the
balancing test should be extended and applied to highway
safety oasss*
Thfe older esses clearly pointed out that size» and
weight are elements of safety, and may b® taken into account
by Legislatures in regulating highways*
The leading case, in 1933, S oute.Carolina^ vs* Ba.cowol 1»
said that regulation of th© us© of State highways is peculiarly
a local concern*

Now, the Court has never retreated from this

statement*
It also said such regulations aro inseparable from
a substantial effect on interstate commerce*

QUESTIONs

¥@t, Mr. Harrim&a, I'm fresale to say

that; I'm disturbed by this long list of exemptions that
Wisconsin has, and don't those exempt products and the like
creat® just as much safety has&rd on Wisconsin roads as the
non** exempt?

MR. HARRIMAN%

I think, comparing any one truck

in any one spot at any on© time, I think the answer would have
to be yes.
Th© hauling of —* from plant to plant, that we have,
like in American Meters, is a limited trip. We discussed it
yesterday.

It's 45 miles.

• These milk hauls -- I don't know just. what, these
milk hauls, where they go, but they go from the farm to the
plant, where th© milk is hauled, delivered for processing.
Pulpwood is hauled usually from the farm or field
or woods somewhere to on® of our paper mills $ and of course
thssa car carriers run all over th© State.

And obviously

tlisir length is as dangerous, or non-dangerous, depending on
which side of this case you take, as perhaps any other vehicle.
But I think it's a justified police power exception,
because automobiles are very long and you can only gat a few
on a trailer.

This extra tan feet makes it. possible for

them ho haul an extra two vehicles.
And, of course, th© State apparently takes the
position that it* .9 batter t© hava only that many long trucks

41
running than to have a large, much larger number of long trucks
runningo
Til© --

QUESTION: Well, do you suggest that: the States can
be more tolerant on the safety factors with respect to local
industries than intarstats haulers?
MR. KARRI MAN;
police power purpose»

Yes, if it* s b&s-\3d upon a proper
But I don't think that meny of these

are more tolerant on the locals than they are on interstate
haulers»

The hauling of -these automobiles is one*

And, like

shipping from Milwaukee to Kenosha on this plant—ia~plu»t,
I mean, that’s something, by its vary nature, interstate
commerce *»«■ I’m sorry? intrastate commerce»
That kind of a thing couldn’t be applied to inter­
state commerce, I mean, by its very nature.

favor interstate common —- intrastate common carriers over inter­
state common carriers?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H„ LHDERER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR» LEDERERs

May it pleas© the Courts

In answer to your question, Mr. Justice Stewart* on
interchanging these vehicles, it is true that each cf -the
vans of a twin trailers: can bra hauled separately by t twin
trailer tractorc

But a twin trailer tractor is a different

piece of equipment than a semi-trailer tractore

A twin

trailer cannot b© interchanged with a semi-trailer tractor,
and, similarly, & send-trailer van cannot b® plaoad on a twin
trailer tractor.
Thus, Wisconsin# by forcing us© of semi-trailers
in the State of Wisconsin and through th© State of Wisconsin,
interferes with interchar.ging of equipment, because the
Wisconsin equipment is not compatible with the ©quip neat used
in the other States, the equipment which is the industry
standard for general commodity carriers.
I think it pvsrtinent in this case that the S'sate
Highway Commission, who are the authors of the administrative
regulation which bans twin 'trailers of any length, or prevents
permits from being issued for them, the Chairman of 3hct
Commission was asked whether he had any opinion an to
safofev ©f these vehicles.

He stated that he was not prepared

to comment on that, and would choose; not to comment on it.

No Wisconsin Highway official has: testified that

51

twin trailers am unsafe»

Indeed, the only Wisconsin Highway

official who had an opinion as to their safety,. Mr. James
Kama, who was -the Motor Vehicle Commissioner of the- State,
testified that he had reviewed the record *— net the record
in this case — but ha had raviewed various reports md
surveys in preparing to testify before a public hearing, and
he had concluded that twin traibars were safe.
No one in this entire record has stated that twin
trailers are unsafe? no one.

The consistent opinion of the

experts, the consistent opinion ©f State officials who have
had experience with these vehicles is that they are safe»
I think tills factor removes this case f corn other
cases.

The Court is not called upon to second-guess the

State Legislature.

Hera the Stats* Legislature, or the Highway

Commission, mo.rs properly, has made a decision apparently on
no data.

What it has dor© is it permitted &a anachronism ‘to

exist in the State.

They are unable to justify the burden

that ;hey* ve imposed o:i interstate commerce by anything other
than the supposition that it might serve safety, and that
supposition h&s been destroyed by the evidence in this case.
Only if there is an irrebufcabl© presumption, a
presumption where it does not matter what the fs,s;p aw, an
irrebut&ble presumption that vehicle sis® is tied fcc safety,
da X think that Urn Stata of Wisconsin should prevail in this
csss.

Because that is the sole thing that they have going

52
for thorns

the presumption, and the assumption, which seems a

reasonable one on the surface, that larger vehicles are less
s&f© vehiclesc
That is not, the cases her®,
I thank the Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ledsrer, on the discriminatory aspect

of your claim, do you -think that your client as a carrier can
raise a claim ©£ discrimination as between Wisconsin manu­
facturers and out-of-State manufacturers, if the -"ireatment
between interstate carriers and intrastate carriers is evenhanded?
MR. LEDERER:

I believe they can in regard tie the

interplant permits, because those permits apply not just to
the manufacturer but fe) the manufacturer or its carrier.
Thus, —
QUESTION:
MR. LEDERERs

But then —
— there-, is no difference in the

application that I knov? of to the carriers theraselives.
In other words, if we war® to assutae that amftrican
Motors or perhaps Cargill Boat Company which rims beate- from
on© sides of Wisconsin -do the other desired to hire an eut-of)

States manufacturer — or ©ut-of-State carrier to carry its
boats, presumably it could. But that would suam u»li?:ely,
given tfcs situation,
QUESTIONs But you don’t contend thwrv !a discrimina-

53
tion as to th© -«• in fa® manufacturer’s right to hir*& an
interstate carrier as opposed to an intrastate carrier for
that purpose# do you?
MR. LEDERER x
tion there.

No# I don't think there’s di.scrimina­

I think the discrimination that exists hers is

the fact that Wisconsin, has exempted so many ©£ its own
industries, those that are of importance to the State, from
the regulation# while continuing to apply the regulation to
industries not import-act to the State.
QUESTIONS

Can yon# as a carrier# object to

discrimination against an industry if there is no discrimina­
tion between carriers?
MR. LEDERER;
QUESTION:

Yes# I think w© can.

What’s your authority for that?

MR» LEDERER;
QUESTION:

I don’t —
Hasn’t the rule bean, rath ::: than

discrimination against carriers# infearstats carriers# is that
the distinction between intrastate commerce and interstate
commerce?
MR. LEDERER:
QUESTION:

Yes# I think thte
If an inters feat© carrier •**■* if a carrier'

teat engages in interstate commerce hires out to- do in-':xasfate
commerce, it is still engaging in intrastate commssrcu at the
ti-Tiss ."•.fe does it.

X mean, if you hired out

the intarplant carrying, you would still be % intrastate

54
commsrc©, 1 suppose; for that; purpose.
MR, LEDERER:
