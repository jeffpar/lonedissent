ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, E£Q.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

idle Court:
This case is also iere to review a judgment of the
Court of Appeals for -the Second Circuit, in this cas© fighting
an order of the District Court dismissing criminal contempt
prosecutions against the two respondents herein, on the ground
that Artie It s XV (a) of the Interstate Agrser.ont on Detainer;, had
been violated when these federal defendants were returned to
state prison between arraignment and trial.

I have a lot of

ground that I would like to cover, and I think the facts essen­
tially ar® very simple and cm be stated very briefly.

The

criminal -contempt indicto® nti ware r^turnad at a time when both
Mauro and Fuse© were prisoners in New York State prisons.

They

wear© returned in the Eastern District of New York—in tlie same
state, in other words.

A writ of habeas corpus ad proseguondam

was issued. No detainer was over lodged against them on this
criminal contempt charge.

They were brought into federal court.

They pleaded not guilty.
Their trial was scheduled,

Thar® was same discussion,

ebout. whether they would stay in the metropolitan correctional

4
mentor, which is a federal pretrial detention facility in New
York.

Fusco indicated that he, wanted to be returned to state

orison,

Mauro that he wished to stay in the federal holding

facility«

In fact*,, ‘the federal holding facility was over-

crowded, and both of them were returned to state prison.
Subsequently their lawyer, in what I think is a
stroke of genius,, mad© the motion to dismiss under the Inter­
state Agreement on Detainers and prevailed.

The Court, of

Appeals, in a two-to-ona decision upheld that action, concluding
that if the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendam were not
■treated as both a detainer and a request, the effect would be
jo

ai.low the Federal Governmsnt to circumvent the requirements

of the Interstate Agreement 3n Detainers by not lodging a
detainer against the prisoner.
I would like to discuss first the general considera­
tions , which I believe are the same in this eas© as in the
prior oases

cor why the writ should not he construed to

constitute either a detainer or a request.
is

The Interstate Agreement on Detainers effected a
cri-iVi* -,1c change in the way shat© prosecutors could procure
cut-ef-state prisoners for trial, and it provided for them &
re&^-.eci mechanism to deal with, the vory real probl®m in tl

cas© of state-to-state transfers and with federal adherence!
to the agreement to deal with a real problem securing federal
prisoners for states trial,

it gave federal prosecutors,

5
however, nothing that they did not as a realistic matter fully
«anjoy before federal adherence to the agreement.
There may have been an occasional instance in which
a federal ad prosequendam writ was not honored.

1 think in

,;die Ford ease respondent's attorney found maybe two cases
where that occurred.
It simply was not a realistic, practical problem,
and it was not on anybody's aind.
Q

However, you assume that when it was net

honored, the Federal Government just dropped the matter?
MR. FREY:
Q

That is apparently what happened.

In the Gordon, case, it was about two

witnesses.
MR. FREY:

I think they were co-defendants.

They

were also wanted as witnesses •
Q

And the statement that they use, this dictum

MR. FREY?

The issue arises in cases where the

observes and then cites the Ponzi

case for the proposition

that compliance is a matter of comity.

We are fully prepared

to stand on the proposition that the Supremacy Clause would
compel requirement in the event that there were a federal/state
confrontation, which is not fco say that the state would and
could not come into federal court under an analogy to the
extension doctrine and say, for instance, "We are in the middle
of a state trial.
Q

Would you”—

We do not have t© decide that question here.

MR. PREY:

Absolutely not.

It is only pertinent in

terms of.understanding whether there was a problem that was
dealt with by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, and

we

maintain that there was absolutely no problem the federal
prosecutors getting state prisoners for trial that was the
concern of either the Council of State Governments or the
Congress.
C

On this issue you agree with Judge Mansfield?

MR. FREY:
Q

On the Issue that the—

Whether or not this is a detainer.

MR. FREY:

Whether or not this is a detainer, but

when you say this issue, I a a addressing the broader issue
first because if we win on tie issue of whether the writ is a
request, we win this case.

We cun also win this case even if

i$i<a writ is a request on the grounds that the writ is not a

detainer.

The arguments as to why the writ is not a detainer

7
are I think fairly clear and have been well canvassed in oar
brief and Judge Mansfield's dissenting opinion-

And I hops to

address myself principally to the legislative history, the
Speedy Trial Act, and the other factors that we think compel
the conclusion that it is net even a request, let alone a
detainer.
Q

The things that our questions prevented you

from addressing yourself to in the first argument.
MR- FREY:

Perhaps, but they are fully relevant to

this case.
In focusing on what the problem was that prompted the
Council of State Governments to adopt a provision such as
Article IV, I think it is crystal clear 'that they ware not
talking about the federal procedure with the ad prosequendam
writ; and I would like to quote just a sentence from the
statement of 'the Council of State Governments in connection
with the circulation of the agreement as a proposal that they
were recommending.

They state:

"In ctddition, the only way

that a prosecuting official can secure for trial a person
already imprisoned in another jurisdiction is by resort to a
/

cumbersome special contract with the executive authority of
•the incarcerating state.

Because of the difficulty end red

tape involved in securing such contracts, they are little used."
That is obviously not a description of the federal experience,
in procuring state prisoners.

8
Q

if the states had the same right, they would not

need the bill at all,
V

MR, FREY:

If the states had a habeas corpus writ

that ran outside their boundaries, that is true.
Q

They would net need it at all.

MR. FREY:

There would still be problems about how

fc© handle expenses,, about—c-ne of the great concerns, one of
the reasons a sending state was reluctant 'to relinquish a
prisoner was they wanted an assurance they would get him back
after the trial in the receiving state.
Congress enacted the Interstate Agreement as federal
law in 1970.

I 'think it is unmistakably clear to anybody who

.reads the legislative history that the motivation underlying
federal adoption of the agreement was for two purposes and two
purposes only.

The first was to facilitate the efforts of

states to procure, federal prisoners for trial and to supply
for federal prisoners a mechanism for clearing state detainers.
This was thought particularly pressing in light of the decision
a y©;n. earlier in Smith v. Hooey involving the trial obligations
of states with respect to federal prisoners.
The second objective was to provide a means for the
District ©f Columbia to procure state prisoners for trial.

It

is impossible to believe fchet Congress meant to alter the means
whereby the Federal Government acquired state prisoners for
•trial and to impose new conditions such as the no-return end

9
the speedy trial requirements of Article IV in connection with
those proceedings.

There is no mention of any such conse­

quence in the section discussing the need for the legislation,
and it seems at least passing strange that if Congress
envisioned this consequence for federal prosecutions, this
aspect of the agreement was confined to the effect, on the
District of Columbia.

And of course the statement by the

Commissioner of the District of Columbia or the Assistant
Commissioner, which was not echoed by the Deputy Attorney
General's explanatiora of what the bill would accomplish, I
think should be given vary little weight.
Moreover, a review of th© various provisions of the
.-agreament reflects anomalies that surely would have been
addressed had Congress realised that it was changing the
procedures whereby th© Federal Government obtains the presence
of state prisoners for trial.
The agreement is set forth in the appendix to our
brief in Ford,

The most obvious provision, which has been

much discussed, is th® proviso to Article IV(a), which is at.
page 8-A of the appendix, which gives the governor 30 days to
air.approve th© request.

I am- sure that Congress thought that

when a state prisoner was wanted for federal trial, the
governor had no power to say, "Mo, we will not deliver him,"
fifty Kiore than the southern governors had power after Brown v.
Board of Education he interpose state sovereignty to resist

/

10
federal orders there.

And I think it would be extraordinary

for Congress to create such a power in state governors, which
•shey surely must not have thought previously existed without
saying a word about it.
Indeedc whatever problems there may have been with
the occasional case prior to federal adherence to the agreement
where some state warden refused to honor the writ, these
problems would surely b® multiplied if this proviso in the
agreement applied.
Secondly, Article IV(c) of the agreement is signifi­
cant because it refers to in respect ©f any proceeding made
possible by tills article.

Tiat is the speedy trial provision.

Che notion that underlies this is that. Article IV was making
possible certain proceedings that, were not previously possible
or feasible, that it was providing—
Q

Mr. Fray, on that point, I must say you are

probably arguing the Ford case more than the Mauro case now,
but that is all right.

On that very point, supposing Indiana

mid Illinois prior to the adoption of this agreement had worked
out an informal procedure whore they exchanged prisoners upon
request and worked out the finances and all the rest so that
they never hacl a problem.

Would this article apply to them

after they both signed the agreement?
MR. FREY:

Not if ihsy continued to use the prior

procedures, not if they did not procure prisoners by filing—

11
Q

They would have to use that particular form,

or ©is® the agreement would not apply,
MR, FREY £

That form or scmo other statement,

invoking their rights under Article IV of the agreement,
Q

So, your construction is that the agreement

only applies to those states which could demonstrate that they
had previously been having problems getting prisoners,
MR, FREY:

Even those states I think by and large

-abandoned their resort to—
Q

So, even if they us© the agreement form, your

argument would still apply because if they had not been
\

having any difficulties before, the procedure would not have
been made possible by the agreement.
MR. FREY:

But I think what that language means is

that wheh you—what the framers had in mind was that this
agreement was providing a mechanism that did not previously
exist, that was different from ones that previously existed.
'There was, after all, extradition, which the states could still
resort to.

There were 'these special contracts which the

state—Q

This very technical reading of the language is

that the criminal trial had to have been made possible? is
'.’hat right?
MR, FREY;

do, I ds not think so,

I think that is

talking about a proceeding to receive the prisoner from one

12
state fc© another.
C

l see.

But you would say that if there were

a pre-existing procedure-“I am just not quite clear on your
argument.
MR. FREY:

I would say that if there were pre­

existing procedure—I do not think what they mean by this is
that the agreement applies only when it was impossible
previously to get a prisoner from one state to another because
:Lt was not impossible previously.

It was just extremely

have availed yourself of the mechanism which we have supplied
you here, then thefe are certain costs that arc associated
with certain responsibilities that we are going, to impose on
you,

no-ratura obligation.

The second ia the

These are a quid pro quo for & very

substantial benefit the state prosecutors were getting, and I
think that is what that—
Q

So, in other words, you would read it as though

i.t just said in respect of any proceeding under this article?
Basic ally that is the way you interpret it?
MR. FREY;

X think it means more than that for us

because if that was all it said, it would not help me at all
because that would—
Q

That is exactly my point.

MR. FREY:

•—not got around the question.

X -chink

13
what it means is any proceeding that is facilitated by this
article.

I do not think they had in mind the situation that

Indiana and Illinois were going along swimmingly before and
really they did not gat any advantage out of this? but still
for some reason they used this form and made a request under

this agreement.

.agreement and custody was delivered in accordar.ce with the terms
of this agreement, then the consequence would be that the
conditions—
Q

Then it all comes back to the question of whether

the writ is a request under the terms of the agreement, still
the same basic argument, the same basic issue.
MR. FREY:

But 1 d3 not think that the speedy trial

provision literally road can apply on—I think it is clear that
the meaning of that provision is that your procurement of 'she
prisoner has to have been facilitated.

I do not think it makes

imy sense to say that this procedure-—
Q

You say that In the status/federal context, but

toen you say you do not make that argument as between two
states that wear® getting along swimmingly.
MR. FREY;

i would make the same argument if Illinois

procured a prisoner from Indiana under their old procedures and
then the Court—
Q
13G days ,

Signed this agreement and then kept the man for
You would say he had no right under this agreement?

14
MR. FREY:

I would say if the defendant said,

"You

should treat this whole procedure as a request under this
agreement in order fees prevert them from circumventing the
agreement,” I would disagree with that.
\

Q

If Illinois asked for him under IV, and

Indiana said, ”w© will give him to you under the old rule,"
would you think that is okay?
MR,, FREY;

I am act sure.

I mean, there are a lot

of combinations that can be played on this.
Q

What I am trying to get at is, Who controls

the destiny of this prisoner, the receiving state or the
delivering stata?
MR. FREY:

The receiving state has the right under

the agreement or under other procedures that may exist to
secure—
Q

You would hava the right, under either, would

you not?
MR. FREY:

Probably under either.

We might have

■she right under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers if we
wanted

to

invoke it.
Q

Could a couple of states enter into a sid©

agreement, saying, "We will only use the Agreement on
Detainers when we really need it.

Our general practice shall

be the old-fashioned one where you give to us and we will take
it.

We will let the detainers still have all the adverse

15
consequences that it used to have.
trial rights, all the rest cf it.

There will be no speedy
We will just stay outside

the agreement"; would that he permitted?
MR. FREY;

It would be with respect to Article IV.

There would fa® no problem.

The evils of the detainers were

really addressed in Article III.

And if states were adherent

to the agreement, the prisoner would have a right to demand
a trial under Article III.

But what we are talking stout here

is Article IV, and that is not addressed t© th© evils of the
detainer system at all but to the difficulty of th® state
prosecutor obtaining a prisoner from another state for trial.
So that I do not think there would b© any problem in saying
if th© statss wanted to not take advantage ©f what Article IV
had given to them, they also would not have, to pay the price
that is associated with using Article IV.

And we have not

taken advantage of Article IV.
Q

But is not th* 120-day speedy trial requirement

for the benefit of the prisoner, not for th® demanding state?
MR. FREY;

to th© state prosecutor, which he desperately needed, certain
conditions were imposed.

If you are going to do this, you are

Q

What if the—I am not saying it normally

happens--but what if the prosecutor says—somebody comes in
and says, "Look, there is no use your grabbing this guy
because we cannot try him within 120 days."

And the prosecutor

says, "Take back that Article IV thing, end let us go by

That would be wrong, would it not?

Q

You and I cannot conceive of a prosecutor doing

that.
MR. FREY;

But I an not sure»

I do not think—©nee

think he could stop it.
Q

For any reason

MR. FREYi

Except "'for continuance in open court for

good cause and so on.
Th® conclusion that nobody understood federal
udh@re.ace to the Detainer Agreement to alter th© traditional
use of th© writ is confirmed by the events that followed its
enactment.

Although the speedy trial and no-return provisions

would obviously constitute d<mg@rous boobytraps for th® unwary
federal prosecutor, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested earlier,
if federal procurement of state prisoners was to be regulated
by Article :-:v, the Justice Department, which had sponsored this

17
legislation in Congress, breathed not a word of these dire
consequences to federal prosacutors.

Instead it assigned the

responsibility for administering federal participation in the
agreement to the Bureau of Prisons, which was intimately
.involved with the responsibilities as a sending state but had
a mostly tangential connection "when the United States is a
receiving state .
Q

Mr. Frey, do you think that federal courts that

.Ignore the dire consequences of the Speedy Trial Act on the
ground that Congress did not know what it: was doing when it
asked federal judges to handle all of these cases without having
enough federal judges to do 'she work?
MR. FREY:
Q

No.

Because Congress obviously did not know the

consequences of that statute
MR. FREY:
consequences.

The

question here is whether these are

I would agree that if Article IV(a) said, "Any

proceeding instituted by the writ of habeas corpus ad
prosequendam by a federal prosecutor shall be subject to the
following conditions," then regardless of how little considered
it was'

or what the consequences were, the courts would be

obliged to follow it.

But it certainly is a basic tenet of

statutory construction that, in deciding how to deal with
ambiguous—or even in Train \Colorado^Public Interest
Research Group with, what seems to be very clear language, the

18
Court can consider the absurdities that might be created, the
extent to which it defeats the congressional purposes, and
the extent to which it creates problems with other legislation.
And in this connection the Second Circuit made no mention of
the Speedy Trial Act? but. I think it is very important to
judicial consideration of this statute.

The Speedy Trial Act

was adopted by Congress only four years after it had adopted
the Detainer Agreement.

And in adopting it, Congress reflected

not the slightest awareness that it had already legislated on
the question of trial deadlines .and procedures for state
prisoners brought in for federal trial.

The result is a

senna© that is at best redundant with the speedy trial protec­
tions that the Court of Appeals found already existed under
the agreement, and is in several respects inconsistent with
them.
Q

There was, was there not, soma opposition to

■'the enactment of the Speedy Trial Act?
MR. PREY;

Yes.

The Speedy Trial Act; was a much

considered*—-in contrast to the Interstate Agreement—-it was
considered in quite some detail.

And the Justice Department

had some opposition to some of its provisions and structure.
Q

Was the Judicial Conference of the United States

involved?
MR,
been

FREY:

I am not sure.

I think it. may well have

13

Q

Yes, it. is a natter of public record that by

unanimous vote th® Judicial Conference opposed the passage of
the act*

But no hearings were conducted of any significance

to let that opposition bo heard»
Q

Did any of the opponents to the enactment of the

legislation mention in any way the existence of the Inter­
state Detainer?
MR. FREYs
escaped my attention.

I am not aware of it? if they did, it
I think ncbedy mentioned it because it

is quite clear that nobody thought it applied.
Q

They were asleep at the switch, as I said

earlier.
MR. FREYs

That may be.

But I think in terms of

what Congress thought, in terms of wh«*t the Department of
.Justice thought, in terms of what the courts thought, in terms
of whrr. the defense bar thought, nobody thought it applied.
Everybody thought when th- Government proceeded by th© ad
prosequendam writ, it was clorng what it had always done.
Q

That is true.

get you very far in
MR. FREY;

That, much fa true.

That dec:' rvot

the argument.
I think it gets me quit® a way because I

think that it shows that there is no reason why this Court
should go out of its way to ray that a request under Article
lYi&l of the agreement—that a writ of habeas corpus ad

prosequendam is a request.

f hero is no linguistic equivalence

20
in those two terms.

The writ on its face is a command.

It is

true that you could say a command is a kind of request:.

But

this is an area in which the Court has full flexibility to do
what seems appropriate to achieve 'the congressional purposes
sad to produce a harmonious and rational scheme of legislation.
And the problems-—if you rule against us in tha speedy trial
area, there are serious problems of inconsistencies that will
bedevil the courts in 'th® future.
To take one example, the telling provision for
extending the time beyond.
Detainers you have 120 days.

Under the Interstate Agreement on
Any extension thereafter must

be for good cause shown and it has to be in open court with the
defendant or its counsel present.
On the other hand, under th© Speedy Trial Act, you
have 60 days.

There are tolling provisions, however.

So that

if in th© middle of those 30 days there is a competency
inquiry, there is an interlocutory appeal by the Government,
some ether event, those days simply do not count, which is
quit© different from th© Interstate Agreement.
What is more, continuances can be granted under th©
Speedy Trial Act.

They do nut have to be in open court.

defendant or his counsel does not have to b© present.

The

But, on

the other hand, there does have to h© a statement of reasons on
ishe record, either oral or-written.
Q

I suppose,if you lose, the prose enters and courts

21
will just, have to abide by the highest common denominator of
•’she two overlapping statutes, the most restrictive
MR. FREY2

provision.

There are going to be a lot of states

which will accomplish no substantial protection of anybody8s
rights but an awful lot of litigation for the courts.
Q

People say that about the Speedy Trial hat

generally. MR. FREY;

Well—

Q

But Congress enacted it.

Q

Its:*. Frey, are you going to argue the moral

case?
MR. FREYOh, yes.

First of all, every on® of idles©

arguments is—
Q

If you win on that argument, you win them all

because th© issue in th© moral case, as I understand it, is
whether the writ is a detainer, not whether the writ is a
request.
MR.

freys

Of course, our contention that the writ is

not © request—
Q

If you win on th© first point in the other case,

you win both cases.
MR. FREY:
Q

That is right.

I would agree with that.

But you are not going

•to argue the moral case separately because you have really
S', quite strong argument in th© moral car.®—

22

MR. FREY:

Oh, I have a very strong argument.

And,

as I indicated earlier to Mr. Justice Stewart, I had intended
to rely largely on Judge Mansfield’s dissent.

I think it is

clear that whatever else was intended, the framers of the
agreement in Congress were dealing with the problems that were
created by the lodging of a detainer.

And I think it is clear

that the writ ad prosequendam is not a detainer.
in a differant way.
Q

It functions

And there is no reason to do—

May I ask this, Mr. Frey:

You emphasize the

practical situation? there are some 5,000 people,

is it each

year there are 5,000 writs issued?
MR, FREY:
•ah® Marshal Service.

That is the information that w® have from
That does not mean 5,000 different

people because the writs could ba issued more than once with
rraspacfc to the same person.
Q

First for indictment and then for trial.

MR. FREY:
Q

First for arraignment, yes.

Am I correct that about 5,000 of those are

•casas where there was a detainer and the other 2,000 there was
■io detainer?
MR. FREY:
Q
Mauro case.

That is our information.

So, feh© 2,000 would be solved if you win the
As to the 3,000, supposing this issue ecuId not

b@ raised on collateral attack—and that is something we do not
have here.

Is it not true that that would solve a great many

23
of these, that are outstanding now?
MR. PREY:
Q

That would solve many of the past casas.

Would it not minimise the overwhelming character

3f this problem?
MR® FREY:

It would minimize the problem, but it

would by no means eliminata it because there are not only the
inconsistencies with the steady trial I have just mentioned
but there are even worse problems with the no-return provision.
The no-return provision—
Q

Could you not solve the no-return problem by

just asking the prisoner if he wants to go back or not?

And

usually, as X understand it, when you pull him out, you have
got him in a temporary, very undesirable facility.

So, would

he not normally want to go back to the more permanent placa?
MR. FREY:
G

He might or might, not. want, to gc back.

Xf ho is awars of the problem and you give him

■‘she optica, what is the difficulty?

MR* FREY:

Just give him the choice.

The problem could be solved *

I am not

saying that in the normal case—
Q

is it not a very simple problem, extraordinarily

simple problem?
MR. FREY:

It is not extraordinarily simple because

:L£ you look at a case like Thompson, the Third Circuit case
which we have a pending petition

for certiorari in, Thompson

was in a state jail which happened to be also the facility

24
where federal prisoners are held..

A detainer had been lodged

against him, and he was then indicted on heroin distribution
charges and brought in by writ into federal court to plead and
returned several hours later to the same jail that he came
from, which also was the jail where he would hrve been kept as
a federal prisoner.

But the paperwork that would have trans­

formed him from a state prisoner into a federal prisoner was
not dons.

And what

we are going to have to rely on is that

the secretaries in the marshal's office do not make a mistake
with their paperwork because if they :.o, a defendant is going
to get a windfall dismissal,
Q

You say this was during the period when this

was kind of

e.

was there.

But once you know the problem, can you not handle

time bomb ticking away, and nobody realized it

the paperwork?

MR. PREY:
mistakes arts made.

Yes, it can be done.

But I am saying that

Wa know what Rule 11 requires district

judges to do in the course ©:: accepting a guilty plea.

But 1

can f.ssure you that across ray desk are some dozens of cases

in

which they do not do it.
Q

We should repeal Rule 11 because judges do not

follow it?

MR. FREY;
Q

No, I an not suggesting—

Should w® abandon this agreement because people

are going to make mistakes and not be ®hl® to follow it?

I do

25

not understand this kind of legal argument.
MR. FREY:

I am simply suggesting that you should

not assume—-I am not asking you to do anything affirmative on
that hreunti sd much as 'asking that you hot assume that there
will be no problem in the future as an empirical matter, if
you make it clear that the agreement applies because in fact
there will bo problems.
Q

But, Mr. Fray, is it not a fact that this whole

■statue was adopted because there is a very serious problem of
people subject to detainers being subjected to unfair treat;a©nt?

Is that not to be weighed in the scale?
MR. FREY:

There is no evidence, Mr. Justice Stevens,

•Shat there was any concern on the part of Congress or indeed
on the part of the Council of State Governments with the effect
of federal detainers.
Q

There is simply no—they were not—

Does not the svidance indicate that about half

the detainer?: were issued by the Federal Government?
MR, FREY:

That is true,

And yet it is clear from

•die focus of the discussions that it was on the effect of
(state detainers.

And let me make another point because the

Speedy Trial Act now provides a mechanism for the state
prisoner to clear the federal detainer.

So, we are back in the

situation where we do not nssd two mechanisms.
both the agreement and the
under the Speedy Trial Act,

Speedy Trial Act.

We do not need
Ha can do it

Congress dealt with the problem

26

'ihere consciously, which I do not believe anybody could
conclude it did in this ares.

And I think, just to sum up, if

the Court holds that the provisions of Article IV of the
Interstate Agreement are in applicable when the Federal
Government uses the writ, this holding would not undermine
the expectations or goals of Congress.

It would not subvert

the concerns that led the Council of State Governments to
adopt the agreement.

But rather it would create a harmonious

relationship between the habeas_corpus, statute, the Speedy
Trial Act, and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

The

state prisoner with a federal detainer can clear the detainer
under the Speedy Trial Act.

The state prosecutor who wants

x federal prisoner can resort to the agreement, and speedy
trials ar<s guaranteed under the Speedy Trial Act.

I cannot

secs why the Court should go out of its way to construe the
writ as a request to undermine this essentially

symmetrical

system which provides adequate protection for all of the
defendant interests and the interests of the criminal justice
system.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Frey.

Mr. Ross.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN G. ROSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas®, ’the Court

I would like to stress at first a few facts with

27
regard to the Mauro casa that I believe were not covered
sufficiently.
Mr. Fusco were

The first thing is this.

Mr. Mauro and

prisoners in the Auburn Correctional Facility

in Auburn , New York at the time of their indictment in the
Eastern District of New York.
Auburn, New York is approximately 300 miles from
Brooklyn.

After their indictment and at the beginning of

November, 1)75, they were produced in Brooklyn by writ.

They

were arraigned on November 2 3th, and they again appeared on
December 2nd in court.

They were returned, however, on both

December 11th, I believe, and December 19th back to Auburn,
The reason why I stress these facts is that this is not a case
in which a prisoner is produced on writ for the purpose of one,
discrete appearance in court and then returned the same day to
his pi see of incarceration so that he has no substantial
damage to his prospects of rehabilitation

or treatment.

This

is a case in which there was a clear abuse of the purposes of
the agreement.
The reason why 1 say this is that the Second Circuit
las recently decided the case in which precisely this issue
was before the Court..

The nan® of the case was United Stat.es v.

Chico, and 1 am sorry it. was not in my brief? but it was
reported after our briefs were filed.
Q

In that case—•

Do you have the citation there?

MR. ROSS:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

It is 558 F2nc 1047

23
In that case, interestingly enough, Judge Mansfield
wrote the decision.

And in chat case there was production of

a prisoner on writ in the District of Connecticut, and he was
returned the same day to his place of incarceration.

Judge

Mansfield, writing for a unanimous bench, held that under
theso circumstances there has not been -die change in condi­
tions of confinement which would warrant the enforcement of
1:he Interstate Agreement on Detainers.
From this case I believe I see a coherent scheme
in the interpretation of the agreement; and that is this.

We

c.o not look at the document which causes the transfer of the
prisoner.

We look at the. transfer of the prisoner.
For example, in thv Mauro case we have a case in

which the prisoners were shuvtled back and forth over a matter
of months.

They remained in Manhattan for three or four weeks

at a time.

For this reason “ do not think it would matter

that the document itself that causes the transfer of the
prisoner is called a writ instead of a detainer.
The Government attempts in its brief to distinguish
the wr. .t from the detainer by stating that the war it is
iiisaa.j.di..-itely executed and therefore it does not have the longfarm perspective effects or luture damaging effects of a
detainer,

However, I believe, that the same analysis applies to

that argument.

The; writ itself, although immediately

executed, causes a complete c is junction—I am sorry—-a complete

29
fragmentation of the continuity of rehabilitation so that the
■prisoner is shuttled from ora jurisdiction to another.
Q

What do you think the word "detainer" in the

statute means?
MR. ROSS:

of course this is one of the main issues

of the case. Your Honor.
Q

That is why I thought I would ask you.

MR. ROSS:

As Congressman Kastenmeier said, a

detainer is a notification cf charges pending against, a
prisoner, and that is the position that I have to take.

And

I believe that that is really what the detainer is all about.
What we are looking at is ho» the notification is received
by the authorities holding the prisoner.

I have to believe

that it is only human nature that when a warden receives
notification of charges pending against a prisoner that his
status is consequently adjusted.
regard to Mr, Mauro and Mr. Fusco?

What was the case with
The original detainer in

•■she case, which was for civil contempt, was lodged against
Mr, Mauro and Mr. Fusco.

Thsy lost all footing.

And it was

for this reason in the Court below that they argued that a
detainer had been lodged against,
I would also like to point out that it is cur
position that the Interstate Agreement does not construe an
.implied repeal of the writ.

For one thing, there are still I

believe four states that at© not. signatory to the agr@ern.ervt.

30
lliili regard to 'these states, therefore, the writ remains
without any restriction in tie production of prisoners.
Moreover, as had been mentioned in the prior argu­
ment , there, always has been a question with regard to whether
or not the writ is mandatory process or whether or not a state
government complies with the writ as a matter of comity.

This

being tin* case, we see that the agreement is a framework which
allows the writ to be implemented.
With regard to
to say this,

the Speedy Trial Act, I would have

There is no indication of a congressional intent

that the Speedy Trial Act abrogated any of the terms of the
state agreement.

Number one, it is always hazardous to elicit

a gleaning of the intent of an earlier Congress from the act
of a subsequent Congress.

And, second of all, there is no

express provision repealing toe agreement.

Thirdly, there is

iin express provision in the Speedy Trial Act which preserves
the prior law with regard to the legality of prisoner transfers
from one jurisdiction to another.

Although the Speedy Trial

Act is complementary, .it serves a different purpose than the
Interstate Agreement.
Q

It is your position as to the definition of

"detainer" in Article IV, I take it, that the governor of New

York could have vetoed the Government's habeas corpus ad
prosequendam if he had done s;o within the period provided
therein?

31

MR. ROSS:
Q

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

And that Congress consented to that?

MR„ ROSS:

Yes, it is, Your Honor, because I believe

that—wall, to be perfectly frank with you, I d© not think
that that state of affairs was ever considered,

But if we

look at the scheme of the agreement as a whole. I believe that
that is the only conclusion that can be drawn because at the
■sin® there was an understanding that there was at least great
doubt as to the mandatory nature of the writ.
A very important f sature of the Speedy Trial Act is
iihat it. does not have a no-rsturn provision.

And I believe

that this is the most important issue of the whole case.
Without the no-return provision, there is no Interstate
Agreement on Detainers.
There are two main purposes of the Interstate
Agreement on Detainers.

The first is the prompt disposition

of criminal charges against prisoners.

The second is the

prompt disposition of detainsrs that are lodged against
prisoner.3.

It has been recognised in the cases decided by the

circuit courts of appeals after the Second Circuit

decided

this case that there is a disastrous, disruptive effect upon
the rehabilitation of prisoners where a prisoner is shuttled
from, one jurisdiction to another.

However, this is always seen

J.n the context of the shuttling of the prisoner from one
sending state

to one receiving state.

But if we look at many

32
of the cases that spoke of compliance with the writ as a
matter of comity» I believe we see that oftentimes there ar©
more than one receiving state which competes for the custody
of the prisoner.

In these circumstances there is only one way

in which a prompt disposition of criminal charges or an
orderly disposition of criminal charges against a prisoner can
be resolved, and that is to provide that when a receiving
state acquires custody of a prisoner»

that receiving stata

must terminate prosecution before giving back that prisoner
to the sanding jurisdiction.

Othe-rw**•© vh*> w<n»jhd h*rr<»n

we would have the case of a prisoner bouncing from on®
jurisdiction to another repeatedly by writ, which I believe
has happened in this case an3 in other cases.
Q

When you sp&&< of this process of interrupted

rehabilitation, I suppose that in cases where the prisoner
files a petition for the traditional writ of hebeas corpus
in the federal court and secures a hearing, he or she is
transported for the hearing.

That has the same disruptive

effect, as you put it, as I suppose the one you have described.
MR. ROSS:
Q

Hot if

i© is successful, Your Honor.

H© does not know at the outset whether he is

going fco be successful or not, and he may not hear for quite a
while.
MR. ROSSt

This is so. Your Honor;

I would distinguish

that, first of all, because i believe ray argument is limited to

33

the writ of habeas corpus a<i prosequendam-C!

But you arc; «emphasizing the interruption of

rehabilitation.
MR. ROSS:
Q

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

As though this were something peculiar to the

kind of cases we are dealinc with here.

In other words,

prisoners frequently cause sn interruption on their own
account.
MR. ROSS:
Q

Yes, Ycur Honor.

And we do not think that is bad,

MR,, ROSS:

do we?

No, in that case there is no way that I

could say that that is bad.

I do not believe at all that that

would b® th® type of thing w.iich is contemplated by the
Interstate Agreement.
Q

And there wars in one recent year more than

12,000 of those eases by escaped prisoners in federal court.
Ho, I am simply suggesting that you are perhaps putting undue
weight on tills interruption
MR. ROSS:

of

rehabilitation.

Your Honor, the weight that I am asserting

is weight of the disastrous effects of prosecution upon
rehabilitation, and that, is che case with Mauro and Fusco.
Q

I suppose it :ls disastrous on a person--the

prosecution is disastrous in that sense if he is at-large and
rot. confined.
MR. ROSS:

Yes, Your Honor.

For that reason, I would

i

34
like in, the Interstate Agreement to a prisoner's bill of
right, especially after having dealt with the Maur© case
S'inca its inception because I sea what happens—*1 did se® in
that case, what happens when a prosecution is initiated against
a prisoner.

And I do not think it is a fair analogy to

rtdune those facts to the facts of the writ of habeas corpus
proceeding where a prisoner is attempting to have an
adjudication with regard to the legality of his custody.
In conclusion, I would have to say this, that wi :hcut
toe no-return provision, there would he w*
Agreement.

The fabric of the agreement would be destroyed?

if the Government is unilaterally allowed to exercise the
writ at any time, then the agreement has no meaning.

Its

purpose is. frustrated, and the agreement itself is destroyed.
Therefore, 2 think it was wito very good reason that the
Second Circuit, Court of Appeals held that in this case

the

Infer stats Agreement controlled the use of the writ.
Q

Before you sit: down, on the issue of whether the

writ, is a detainer, Judge Mansfield cites a great deal of
history about detainers causing harmful consequences on the

pr .1zemva

against whom they have, been lodged.

Is there

\

anything in all this history that preceded feh© enactment of
ti-in agreemnt or the adoption of this agreement and to©
of the statute following it indicating that there
had ixan any comparables abuse of the writ of habeas corpus

35
.?,d prosequendam?
MR. ROSS:

Mot that I am aware of, Your Honor,

However, in the Mauro and Fuses case and in casses comparable
to it, it seems as if there has been that abuse-, because 'the
last consideration is the considaration for the prisoner.

And

the writ has been used without consideration to the prisoner
to shuttle the prisoner back ©nd forth.
Q

But we cannot really rely on the facts of this

case to explain what
MR. ROSS:

.the statute means.
1 understand, Your Honor.

However, I am

not aware in the history of any record of the use of the writ
an that manner.
Thank you.

X cannot understand the argument that it is a dreadful

thing to return the prisoner to his state prison between
ixralgament and trial in a federal case.

If a prison in

Illinois is brought in for a federal trial in Indiana, let us
say, he is likely to be

kept in a local jail, which is

severely overcrowded and where there are surely no rehabilita­
tive programs of any kind; whereas instead, if he were

Indeed, in the Ford casa I think

Lt is significant that at sentencing -Judge Motley said that
she was impressed with the fact ‘that despite Ford's serious
criminal record, he had taken advantage of an opportunity
offered in prison in Massachusetts to earn a high school
equivalency diploma and apparently continuing
courses.

to take further

So, it is clear that Ford actually benefited.
Q

Mr. Frey, if the United States were held to be

a receiving as well as a sending state but the writ is not
deemed to ha a detainer, is the United States in serious
trouble or not?
Ml. FREY;

If you are suggesting that, what we could

do is radically revise our procedure for lodging detainers-—
Q

Was there a dsfcainer in this case?

Thar® was

siot.
MR. FREY:
Q

Not in this case.

It was not something you called a detainer.

MR. FREYj

There is a form which is normally used

which is labeled a detainer.
Q

That is the question in this case.

But if w©

held that what, you did here was not a detainer and it would not
be a detainer in any other case, just to proceed by habeas

37

corpus, which is what you would like us to hold—
Ml. FREY;
Q

That would —

--that would help you»

KR. FREY;

That would help us in 40 percent of the

cases„
Q

If you really do want to use the detainer.

MR. FREY %

We d© ise the detainers because they do

perform an important function.

It is normal.ly useful and

important, particularly since we are going to proceed
promptly

with disposition cf the charges under the speedy

Trial Act; it is useful and important to tell the state
custodian that indeed there are charges pending, that the
person should not be released to the street without letting
us know since that increases the possibility of escape, and
associated problems„

There are good reasons for filing

detainers, particularly in the federal system where the
detainers are not—at least now with the Speedy Trial Act—
accompanied by any of the abases.
Q

Of course if it were clear, if the act. had

said on its face that the United States is a receiving as
well as si sending state, the passage of the Speedy Trial Act
would not help you much, would it?
MR. FREY:

There would be an issue as to whether

the Spsedy Trial Act would operate in some way as repeal of
inconsistent provisions in tie prior legislation.

I think that

33
would be an Issue.

I do not think we have to confront that

issue.
Q

I know you think not, but we might disagree

with you on whether the United States is a receiving state
undsr this act.

And if we did, you say that we should then

see ;„£ the Speedy Trial Act did not partially repeal it.
Ml. FREY;
for si minutes,

Mo, because the—well, let me

backtrack

if you disagree with us that the United States

is not a receiving state"*-an issue which I do not think yon
actually have to reach to decide these cases—you may neverthe­
less agree with us that the writ is rot a. reguest...
Q

You wrote a lot of interesting words about it.

MR. FREY %

But the words that we wrote*—we struc­

tured the brief that way because the words that we wrote \m
feel ara fully applicable to the proposition that the writ, is
fcot & request-.

It does not iauch matter to us which ground you

«argumenta.

There is, however, a difference which is that

Q

Is it clear under the act that if a state asked

he says, "Great, I would lika to gat tried and I waive
