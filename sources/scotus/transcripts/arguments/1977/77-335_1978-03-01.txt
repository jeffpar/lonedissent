MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in No. 77-335, Oppenheimer Fund v. Sanders,
Do I understand you are submitting now?
MR. BERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I have been informed

I have only nine minutes of my time remaining, and with your
leave I would like to reserve those for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. BERMAN:

You may do so.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ruby, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD N. RUBY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF IHE RESPONDENTS
MR. RUBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Before proceeding with the body of my argument, I
would like to correct an erroneous statement that was made by
petitioners' counsel yesterday in response to a question I
believe from .Mr. Justi.ce Rehnquist.
Contrary to petitioners’ contention, a request for
information as to the names and addresses of class members
pursuant to the discovery rules was orally made by the plain­
tiffs at a conference with the District Court in June 197 4 and
the defendants had a full opportunity to argue in the District
Court that the cost of discovery of this information should
be borne by the plaintiffs rather than the defendants.

This is

4
manifestly clear from the briefs submitted by the parties in
July of 197 4 as requested by the District Court dealing with
the issue of whether such information may ba obtained through
discovery and, if so, the appropriate application of the cost
of discovering this information in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ruby, what was the ruling of the

District Court on that discovery motion?
MR. RUBY:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the court finally

issued a decision, as you know, in which it determined that
the defendants should bear the cost of obtaining this informa­
tion.

As I will indicate in connection with the briefs sub­

mitted, the matter of the application of the discovery rules
and who should bear the cost under them was argued and con­
sidered.

The District Court did not specifically in its

opinion make reference to it, but I think the thrust of
petitioners' position is that they were in some way prejudiced
because they had no opportunity to in effect make a protective
order or to deal with the question.

And I think as far as that

is concerned, the record would indicate clearly that they had
a full opportunity to express their views.
QUESTION:

Well, one of the District Court's reasons,

as I read it, for requiring your opponents to bear the $16,000
cost was that they had opposed your motion to define the class
action, and I would think that might have more relevance if it
had

gone on class action so far as Judge

Griesa was

5
concerned than if it had come up at the discovery stage,
MR. RUBY:

Nell, I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and

I cannot, of course, state preicsely what was in Judge
Griesa's mind, but I can say clearly thathe did give consider­
ation to the question of the discovery rules.

For example,

if

I may just refer to a brief submitted by the unaffilidated de­
fendants which was requested by Judge Griesa — and I am
quoting now from Document 90, which is referred to in the
index of documents filed in the appendix •— page 3 of the de­
fendant's brief says, "Since the discovery here sought is
solely for the purpose: of enabling plaintiffs to fulfill their
obligations under Rule 23, the cost of such discovery should
clearly be borne by plaintiffs."

They go on on page 4 to say,

"Even if, as suggested by the Court" — meaning the District
Court — "the cost of identifying the members of the class to
whom notice can be mailed is a cost of discovery.

The pertin­

ent decisions in the area of discovery make it clear that such
costs must be borne by the plaintiffs,"

And likewise the

defendant, Oppenheimer Manager Corporation, submitted a brief
in which one of their topic headings x/as in Document 92,
"Under the discovery rules, the cost of identifying class
members are properly chargeable to the plaintiffs."

So at

least I think it is clear that the Court considered it and they
had a full opportunity to argue it.
QUESTION;

But you said Judge Griesa did not rule on

6

it?
MR. RUBY:
Justice.

Well, I cannot say that, Mr. Chief

I can simply say he didn't specifically refer to it

in his opinion, but I think a fair reading of his opinion would
indicate that he considered all of the arguments that were
made.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ruby, Judge Mulligan in his opinion

s»caid chat the plaintiffs have never sought discovery relief
under Rule 3 4.

I take it you view that as erroneous?

MR. RUBY:
erroneous.

Mr. Justice Powell, I view that as

It is true that we did not file a piece of paper,

but I don't think that is really the issue here.

At a con­

ference with the District Court, an application was made,
considered, and everyone had ar. opportunity to address them­
selves to it.
QUESTION:

Orally?

MR. RUBY:

Orally, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ruby, that was before the class had

been determined, was it not?
MR. RUBY:

Yes, it was, Mr. Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

What exactly did you request orally?

MR., RUBY:

What we requested, Mr. Justice Stevens,

was that if this information should be required and •—
QUESTION:

What information?

MR. RUBY:

That is information as to the names and

7
audresses or class memiiers.
QUESTION:

Which you couldn't possibly know who they

would be until you know what the class was, could you?
MR. RUBY:

Well, we had requested the class defini­

tion, Mr. Justice Stevens.

We had asked the court to define a

class which would encompass people between March 23, 1963 and
April 24, 1970 and who were still stockholders of the fund.
Now, we took the position —
QUESTION:

Of course, your opponents took a different

view of what the —
MR. RUBY:

They opposed our class definition.

QUESTION:

--- and the court agreed with them?

MR. RUBY:

The court issued a decision, Mr. Justice

Stevens, in which it determined that it would accept the pro­
posal made by the defendants, tut I would respectfully submit
that a fair ireading of the District Court's opinion and the
whole proceedings relating thereto would indicate that the
District Court was issuing a decision which really was inter­
related in the sense that it was considering what the various
proposals were, and I think it took into account the defendants'
position as to the class definition and then determined that —and I don't think it determined necessarily on this ground
alone, but at least it took into account that fact in deciding
that it should have the defendants bear this -QUESTION:

But if I understand you correctly, if he

8
had granted your discovery request at the time you made it,
namely asking for those who were still stockholders in 1970,
you still would have needed more -MR. RUBY:

Mo, Mr. Justice —

QUESTION:

-- because that wouldn't have been the

whole class.
MR. RUBY:

Mr. Justice Stevens, if I can answer you

in this way, our position was that if we had the class defined
as we proposed, which was the people who bought during this
period who were still stockholders of the fund, it would not
have been necessary at all to obtain this information because
what we could have done is to send out a notice to all of the
current stockholders of the fund directing, of course, the
notice in a sense having an introductory part that said this
is directed to those who purchased during this period.

If we

had done that, individual notice would have gone to all the
class members, the class would have been sufficiently defined
so that judgment could have been entered under the rules of
23 (c) (3)

and the information would not have been needed, at al
So what we vrere really saying to the District Court

is, Your Honor, we don't think we need this information, how­
ever, if you were to accept the position taken, then we ask
that it be obtained through discovery.
The main issue before this Court, at least as
initially presented by petitioners' brief, is whether the

9
District Court has discretion to require defendant Oppenheimer
Fund to bear the expense of identifying class members in this
case as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in its
en Dane decision, or whether, as the petitioners contend, there
should be a hard and fast rule in all cases that the plaintiff
must bear the expense of obtaining information as to the names
and addresses of class members and that that the District Court
should have no discretion in this area.
It would appear from netitloners' argument yesterday,
during which petitioner scarcely mentioned this question, that
petitioner does not place great weight upon its position on
this issue.

The petitioner instead appeared to place primary

emphasis upon a subsidiary contention, that is that the
District Court abused its discretion by requiring the defendant
fund to bear the expense of culling out the names of class
members from its computer tapes, arid that, the Court of Appeals
erred in affirming the District Court's discretionary deter­
minat ion.
The question of whether the District Court abused
this discretion is a rather limited one since, of course, the
issue is not what appellate judges would have done in like
circumstances but rather was the District Court's determination
so clearly erroneous or arbitrary as to constitute an abuse of
discretion.
I might note that this Court in fact has usually

10

declined to even review cases involving discretionary determin­
ations.
In the instant case, as I will more fully discuss in
my argument later, the District Court’s discretionary determin­
ation was well supported by the record in this case, by the
applicable discovery rule, and by well recognised commentators
on the subject.
QUESTION:

You are relying then on the discovery pro­

District Court had discretion in this case and we believe that
the discovery rules are applicable.
QUESTION:

Well, .if it weren't the discovery rules,

what statutory or case authority is there for the District
\

Court to shift the cost of financing a part of the law suit
from the plaintiff to the defendant?
MR,. RUBY:
Rehnquist:

I only suggest this to you, Mr. Justice

In the Nissan case, which my adversary relies

upon heavily, the Court took the position that it did not be­
lieve that the discovery rules controlled or governed the
question of whet her or not the plaintiff or the defendant
should obtain the information and who should pay for it; al­
though it did not say that the spirit of those rules and the
decisional law under them may offer guidance.

It felt, how­

ever, that Rule 23(d) was in fact the more appropriate rule.

11
But I think the important thing from Nissan is that
the court in that case,

the Fifth circuit, reviewed the de­

cisions in this area and noted that the courts, contrary to
what this Court had indicated in Eisen, that is that the cost
of preparing and mailing the notice has to under the usual
rule be borne by the plaintiff, the courts that had dealt with
the question of the identification of class members or the
attaining of information thereto had in some cases placed the
burden on the plaintiffs and in some cases placed the burden
on the defendants because it was recognised there that you
were not dealing with the same kind of activity and that the
District

Courts should have discretion.
And even the Firth Circuit, Mr.

did not set down any hard and fast rule.
QUESTION:

Justice Rehnquist,

ing that he had run out of fees to pay his attorney and needed
$10,000 to continue to maintain the lawsuit to require the
defendant to supply the $10,00C pending the outcome of

the

lawsuit?
MR. RUBY:

Not at all, sir.

Not at all.

I think this

is an entirely different situation.
QUESTION:

Well, what happens if he comes in and says

I have ordered these records and they cost $17,000 and I only
have $7,000?

MR. RUBY:

I would say this, Mr. Justice Marshall.»

has the money.

term inat ion —QUESTION;

You do recognize that back in the good old

days the defendant won Id tell you to go shop, wouldn't he?
MR. RUBY:

Yes, he would, sir.

certainly that is our primary position.

Yes, he would.

And

I simply wanted to

point out, in response to Mr. Justice Relinquish’s question,
that even the Firth Circuit in Nissan, which the defendants
rely on heavily, recognized that there should be discretion in
this area, even if Rule 23(d) were to be appropriate rather
than discovery rules.
Since the petitioners do devote a fairly extensive
par t of —
QUESTION:

Mr. Ruby, on the question of discretion,

do you think that it was an appropriate exercise of discretion
for the trial judge to rely on the fact that since the de­
fendants had taken a position with respect to the proper
definition of the class and he agreed with then, that therefore
they should pay the cost?
MR. RUBY:

I think it was fair, Mr. Justice Stevens.

I think, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the arguments
made by the defendants may have been entitled to some consider­
ation, but they did net require a determination that the class

should be defined as the defendants wanted to have it defined»
I think this Court has indicated that classes may be defined
in various ways, there is no magical one definition necessarily,
and I think in a footnote in the Eisen case this Court in­
dicated. that it may be permissible for the plaintiff in that
case to redefine its class with the specific intention of re­
ducing the costs of notice involved.
I would say this in answer to your question, Mr.
Justice Stevens, that if a defendant takes a position and says
I want to have a class defined mere broadly than the plaintiff
does, I think it is fair for a court, as long as you are not
dealing with an obviously improper class that, the plaintiff was
proposing — and I suggest we did not offer an improper class
and I think the Court of Appeals believe that to be the case —
QUESTION: But your class would have excluded people
who had in some sort of an equitable sense an equal interest in
the recovery?
MR. RUBY:

Not necessarily, Mr. Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

They would have paid too much for their

shares, wouldn't they?
MR. RUBY:

Ho.

I think there is a distinction which

even the Court of Appeals noted, that people who were no longer
stockholders because they had both bought and sold, might not
have been damaged because they might have been -QUESTION:

Oh, I see your point.

MR. RUBY:

So I would

suggest that it was a fair point for the District Court to take
into account.

I would —

QUESTION:

What is your reason for saying that notice

and the names of parties should be treated differently?
MR. RUBY:

Welly if I may get to that, Mr. Justice

QUESTION:

nerore you qo, let me asx you this:

say this is a discretionary powerof the District Court.
what factors would enter that discretion?

You
Now,

Assume hypothetical­

ly that a case were, instead of $16,000, as it is now or it was
at the time the case arose, the cost was $100,000, would the
judge say as part of his exercise of discretion, well, that is
just too much, we won t go that high?

Is the cost one factor

or what enters into the exercise of discretion?
MR. RUBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the ques­

tion here is not dissimilar from the problem which faces the
District Court any time it is dealing with discovery questions.
If a plaintiff seeks to obtain information from the defendant
or the other way around, the cmestion of whether or not. the
burden involved is undue, and I think that is the critical
thing, whether it is undue.

It is a factor which the District

Court must consider, and if we sought to require a defendant
or in another case another litigant sought to require his
adversary to produce information that cost him $100,000, as you

15
have indicated, Mr. Chief Justice, in is quite possible that
the District Court would say that is an undue burden and would
enter some order which would protect the interests of the def endant.
So I think what you are dealing with here is the
facts in this case, and I suggest to the Court that

based

upon the facts in this case, it cannot be said that the
District Court abused its discretion.
If I might go on, and in answering Mr. Justice White—
QUESTION:

Do you think the court would have it with­

in its power, its discretionary power requirement that the
plaintiffs put up a bond sufficient to cover the costs?
MR. RUBY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

He could have done that here, you think?

MR. RUBY:

He was asked to do so.

He was asked to

do so, because I think he considered the fact that bonds, of
course, are onerous, was it really necessary.

I think the

petitioner indicated in response to a question from Mr.
Justice Brennan yesterday that the plaintiffs here had about
$25,000 worth of stock.

I don’t think the District Court felt

under the circumstances that it was necessary.
The defendants' argument on this point about the
question of a hard and fast rule is based upon the premise that
the plaintiff is required in all cases to bear the cost of
discovery or obtaining information as to the names and addresses

16

of class members under Eisen IV as part of his obligation to
bear the cost of printing and mailing the notice to the class,
Eisen IV, however, did not hold, as defendants erroneously
claim, that information as to the names and addresses of class
members may not be obtained through discovery, nor did it in­
dicate that the cost of obtaining this information must be
borne in all cases by the plaintiff.
In point of fact, Eisen IV did not even deal with
the question of allocating the costs of obtaining information
as to the names of clciss members.
Defendants argue, nevertheless, that it is a pre­
requisite to sending the notice: mandated by Eisen IV that
plaintiffs obtain the names and addresses of those to whom the
notice will be sent and therefore the cost of obtaining this
information must be borne by the plaintiff under Eisen IV.
Defendants’ argument is not we! 1 founded, for several
reasons.

First, defendants mistakenly assume that simply be­

cause it is necessary to obtain the names and addresses of
class members prior to giving notice to the class, this in­
formation may not be obtained under the discovery rules.
this were

If

true, however, it would also logically follow that

information relating t:o the definition or scope of the class,
whether the members of the class can be identified through
reasonable effort, what is the best practical notice under the
circumstances, all of which presumably must be obtained prior

17

to giving notice to the class

could not be obtained through

discovery.
In this very case, discovery was permitted by the
District Court without objection by the defendants with respect
to these matters and other matters relating to the method and
cost of sending notice to the class, and indeed defendants in
their reply brief, I believe on page 9, appear to concede the
fact that such information may be obtained through discovery.
If plaintiffs are permitted under the discovery
rules to obtain information as to all of these matters per­
taining to class action requirements, it would be arbitrary, we
.... tf to hold that the plaintiffs iaaj -__ . obtain information
under the discovery rules as to the names and addresses of the
class members.
QUESTION:

The question though is the cost?

MR. RUBY:

Weil, I think, Mr. Justice White, that

basically what I am saying is that if you were talking about
the discovery rures» that the question of the allocation of
cost becomes a matter within the discretion cf the District
Court, and the question is normally whether there is an undue
burden or expense.
QUESTION:
side, I suppose

Maybe so, but the argument on the other
I imagine, I think it is that the discretion

is controlled by Rule 23 policies with repsect to cost.
MR. RUBY:

Well, I think there is no authority, Mr.

13
Justice White, that would suggest that the discovery rules and
the policies under the discovery rules should not apply.

Even

in the Nissan case, as I mentioned before, which is the only
court I know which has really suggested that Rule 23 (d) rather
than discovery rules might be governing the issue, even Nissan
says that the discovery rules, the spirit of those rules, the
decision in law under them may provide guidance with regard to
the question of the allocation of costs.

So I would really

suggest to the Court that while we believe that the discovery
rules are applicable, as the Court of Appeals in its en banc
decision found and we have cited authority in our brief support­
ing that decision, I think the federal discovery rules them­
selves, the language support our position — but even if you
were to say, as the Nissan court did, that Rule 23(d)

should

govern, I think it is a distinction Without a difference because
I think the issue is still whether or not within the discretion
of the court there is an undue burden or expense, and that the
spirit of the discovery rules would apply anyway.,
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't Rule 33(c) govern if it is

the discovery rules, where it says the burden of deriving or
ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the
parties serving the interrogatories for the party served?
MR, RUBY:

Well, the Court of Appeals dealt with

that, Mr. Justice
QUESTION:

I realize that.

MR. RUBY:

and I would like to answer your ques­

QUESTION:

Do you rely on anything other than Judge

tion.

Hayes' distinction?
MR. RUBY;

Well, we rely on first of all the fa.ct

that what we are dealing with here is clearly computerized
inforraation.

We are dealing with computer tapes, we are

dealing with computer material —
QUESTION:

But isn't it a fact that, the defendant

would have had to prepare a new program in order to provide
you with this information?

It isn't as if he could just have

a printout on an existing computer system.
MR. RUBY:

That is true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But

in terms of what is the appropriate rule, as you have asked,
I think the rules themselves plus the textual commentators I
think have recognised,, also the advisory committee notes have
recognized, that there is a significant difference in how you
treat discovery of ordinary business records and how you treat
discovery of computerized information.
Of course,

in the Second Circuit's en banc opinion,

they pointed out that Rule 34 is specifically applicable to
the computerized information, and in the opinion the court in­
dicated that unlike Rule 34, Rule 33 was not especially
tailored to the discovery problems posed by contemporary
computer technology, and then the court also went on to say

20
that the draftsmen of Rule 34 chose wisely in light of the
relative judicial inexperience with discovery problems posed
by computer technology not to burden discovery of computerized
information with the more rigid principle of Rule 33(c).
QUESTION:
what the process is?

Well, h at difference does it really make
If it costs $16,000, what difference

does it make whether it has to be done manually or by computer
or by some other method?
MR. RUBY:
Chief Justice.

1 think it makes this difference, Mr.

The concept

behind Rule 33 (c)

is that there are

records, ordinary business records and that one party, the
responding party can simply take these records and turn them
over to the discoving party because the burden of going through
the records and examining them is the same for both parties.
But we are not dealing with that situation here.

It is unreal"

bear the expense of doing this.

He can shift the cost to the

discovering party only on showing under Rule 26(c) that
justice so requires in order to protect himself from undue
burden or expense.

In many instances, the peculiarities of

computerized information actually will oblige the disclosing
party to engage in fairly sophisticated electronic manipula­
tion and analysis of the data in his computer system" —QUESTION:

MR. RUBY:

The transfer agent is not a party to this

case but has been essentially treated — anc. I think the
parties have treated him as the defendants’ agent.
QUESTIONs

Well, is that conceded?

MR. RUBY:

The defendants have not raised such a

question, Mr. Justice Powell.

QUESTION:

I am sure that the defendants pay the

mary duty?
MR. RUBY:

they are employed by and retained by the defendant fund.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume for the moment that the

material you seek were in the hands of a wholly independent
party, how would you proceed to get it?
MR. RUBY:

I think if the information I were seeking

they have treated it c.s in effect being in their hands, you
would have a different, a wholly different case because we are

Even where you are dealing with third parties,

Mr. Justice Powell, ycu can seek under federal rules discovery
from them, but the District Court would then have to make a

decision in the context of the fact that you are seeking it
from a third party having no relationship to either the plain­
tiff or the defendant.

So I would only say you would have a

different issue.
And I would only conclude by saying here that we are
in a situation here where we have a very different situation

than you have where you have ordinary business records.

holding that there was; discretion under the discovery rules
and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion and -QUESTION:

Mr. Ruby, just before you sit down, because

I didn’t quite finish before, what factor is there that supports
the exercise of the discretion the way the District judge exexcised it, just the fact that there was a lot of money in the
fund?
MR. RUBY:

No, sir.

No, sir.

I think what wouId

support their position is the Court of Appeals in reviewing
I

this pointed out two things:

They said first of all that —

QUESTION:- The defendant opposed the class and there
was a relatively small amount of money involved?

MR. RUBY:

Well, not a relatively small amount.

They

said that the burden imposed was not unreasonable in light of
the nature of the information sought and the extent and
character of the fund's business operations.
V

The Court of

25
Appeals pointed out that there was not an injustice when you
are talking about whether it is an undue burden or expense, it
was not an injustice in requiring one whose business is vast
and complex to go to proportionately greater lengths, and they
also pointed out that it was not unreasonable to demand of
the respondent that it employ its computer resources to provide
discovery information of a relatively simple nature where, as
in this case, the respondent fund makes extensive use of
computers in the operation of its business.
So really what they were doing was considering whether
the burden was undue, and for these reasons plus the fact that
they said it wasn’t unreasonable because the defendant had in
effect necessitated the costs by opposing the class definition.
So it was a combination of those things.

And I would support

that, given the rather limited consideration here about abuse
of discretion that it should not be found that the court abused
its discretion.
I would respectfully submit that the Court of Appeals'
en banc decision be
QU33TI0N:

Could I ask just one mere question.

Would

it have cost your clients approximately the same amount of
money to get the information from the transfer agent, assuming
the defendants had authorized the transfer agent to give you
the information?
MR. RUBY:

By ’’the information," Mr.Justice White,

do you mean the raw material?
QUESTION;

No, no.

I mean furnish whatever it was

you wanted the defendants to furnish you, they were going to
get it from the transfer agent, I take it?
MR. RUBY;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

And they were the ones who had the in­

agent, furnish it to the plaintiffs but get the money, get the
cost from them, would it have cost you approximately the same
amount of money as it would have cost the defendants, $16,000?
MR. RUBY:

I can’t answer your question other than

saying that I have no information that it would cost us more
or less.

It is possible that because of their relationship

with the defendant, it might cost the defendant less, but I do
not know.
QUESTION;

Nell, assuming that it would cost you the

identical amount of money, do you still think it is a Rule 34
thing rather than a 33 matter?
MR. RUBY;

Yes, sir, I would say that the federal

rules and the text writers, I think it is a Rule 34 case.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED BERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS—REBUTTAL
MR. BERMAN:

On the question of what the District

Court had before it and what in the way of requests for dis­
covery, the District Court's opinion at the very outset states
that plaintiffs have moved for class action treatment of a
part of these consolidated cases which consist of both class
and derivative claims, certain problems have been raised
mainly as to the definition of the class and as to who is to
bear certain expenses connected with the giving of notice.
That is the issue that the District Court thought he was deal­
ing with.

He didn't say we have here a problem in relation to

the discovery rule but as to who is to bear the cost of giving
notice.
Now, Mr. Ruby says that giving notice doesn't
necessarily mean coming up with a list of names and addresses
to which the notices are to be sent.

But if you are going to

start to.fragment the giving of notice, then he might as we11

to pay for the cost of notice, doesn’t say that we have to pay
for the cost of printing the letters that are to go to the
security holders.

They may even have a printing press in

their plant, let them print the notices.

It merely says that

we have to pay the cost of sending the notices.
start to fragment what is involved here —

Once you

28
QUESTION?

Mr. Berman, could I interrupt , because

there is one — the district judge seemed to place great
emphasis on the fact that the defendants' position with
respect to the definition of the class was adopted, and since
the defendants urged a particular definition they should be
responsible, and it is kind of a strange situation.

If I

understand it correctly, the defendants wanted a larger class
than the plaintiffs did, is that correct?
MR. BERMAN:

No.

There was a shifting about in this

sense during the course of the proceedings in the District
Court.

The plaintiffs, of course, initially asked that the

cioos be deliiKsd precisely as it was finally defined in the
court's order, that is covering —•
QUESTION:

Oh, they did.

I understood him to say

that he asked to exclude those who had sold their shares.
MR. BERMAN:

After the decision in Eisen II came

down and it became clear that the plaintiffs would have to bear
the cost of notice if Eisen III were sustained by this Court,
then the plaintiffs tried to diminish the cost and they said,
well, let's drop out all those shareholders who —

MR, BERMAN:

are no longer shareholders.
Now, why did the defendants oppose that?
And the defendants opposed it because,

as they read Eisen IV, Eisen IV said it is an unambiguous

29
requirement of Rule 23 that members of the class receive no
individual not ice , and it -—
QUESTION:

Well, that is how the class has been de­

fined, but I am asking why did the defendants -- it is normally

their potential for liability is smaller.
MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION:

In fact, the defendants —
Why did they oppose a smaller definition

of the class in this case?
MR. BERMAN:

Because we felt, as the District judge

concluded, that this was an arbitrary and unreasonable exclu­
sion of -those who were properly in the class and if we pro­
ceeded on that basis -QUESTION:

Could the District Court have reasonably

inferred that you thought this might impose an additional
notice caused on the plaintiffs and therefore possibly win the
lawsuit?
MR. BERMAN:

Well, I can't see how he could, in view

of his saying that this is an arbitrary reduction of the class
and I will not do it.
QUESTION:

The defendants really wanted to try to

protect the benefits of these fringe members of the plaintiffs"
class, protect the interests of those members of the class
who would be excluded by narrowing the definition?
MR. BERMAN:

Well, it seemed to us that the District

judge

having concluded chat it would be an abirtary exclusion

that he couldn't sustain, then to turn around and say to us
now you pay for it because you raised the question with which
I have reached agreement and therefore you pay for it for —*
QUESTION:

It is just sort of an interest in symmetry

It would have been arbitrary to exclude them, that is the only
reason, there was no financial gain for the defendants bynarrowing the claim?
MR. BERMAN:

No.

In fact, the defendants then sug­

gested to the judge narrow the claim —
QUESTION:

I mean by broadening the class, by broad­

ening the class.
MR. BERMAN:

— the defendants suggested to the judge

narrow the class to just the year 1968 because there can't be
any question that our prospectus for 1969 gave the kind of in­
formation they were talking about, and the judge said, well, I
don’t think I will, I think I will keep it at those two years
because the subsequent prospectus gave still more information
and I think it is at least arguable or it is a triable issue
that perhaps the '68 prospectus was net --

:he ’69 prospectus

was not adequate.
So we had ourselves suggested the narrowing it to
the one year, but the judge felt that it was not proper in the
circumstances.

So we were not trying to keep it as expensive

as possible, it would have beer less expensive —•

31

QUESTION:

But once the time frame had been estab­

lished, you wan ted to keep it -- between the two alternatives
within the given time frame, you wanted the larger class?
MR. BERMAN:

We thought we would all be vulnerable

if we proceeded by this arbitrary narrowing of the class, that
at some point in the proceeding we would be told that it was
wrong and it had to be done all over again with added expense
for everybody.
Now, there has been some suggestion by my opponent
that the Nissan decision does not actually hold that the cost
of assembling the names and addresses must lie borne by the
plaintiffs, and in our reply brief, since he has made that
point in his, we say that this contention ignores Nissan's
statement at 552 F. 2d 1102, reading, "Upon commencing a class
action, the class representatives must be prepared to accept
the concomitant responsibility of identifying absentee class
members as well as paying the cost of their individual notice."
So it says it as plainly as English would seem to be able to
say it* that they must bear the cost of identifying the class
members and, of course:, the whole thrust of the decision is to
that effect.
Now, a very important point that I won.Id like to
mention to the Court, although I assume that it senses it is,
that if the en banc Circuit Court of Appeals decision is to
be accepted with the type of reasoning set forth therein as to

the duties of one who has computerized information and has to
engage in furnishing devices to unlock it and so forth, if that
goes on and the costs have to be borne by the respondent, there
is going to occur a very significant broadening of the dis­
covery rules aid procedures at a time when there is great de­
mand from the bench and the bar for a ncirrowing of discovery
procedures and to do away with the obvious abuses that have
been taking place in the discovery field.
QUESTION:

Isn't there a committee of the Judicial

Conference addressing itself to that problem?
MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION:

There is indeed. Your Honor.
Wasn't that the appropriate place to solve

the problem?
MR. BERMAN:

That is my thought, too, Your Honor, and

we cite some —
QUESTION:
no use arguing to as.

One of us is a member of that, so there is
There is only one member and that is the

Chief Justice.
MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION:

Again, we find -Any rules they change must be passed upon

by the entire Court though.
MR. BERMAN:

That is a useful precaution, I would

think.
Again, there is a consistence by the plaintiffs"
counsel —in talking about computerized information —

33

QUESTION:

Mr. Berman, may I ask one more cfuestion

about the alternative definit:’/ ns of the c.1 ess?

Do I correctly

understand that if the plaintiffs' version had been accepted
rather than the defendants' version, most of this cost would
have been avoided?
MR. BERMAN:

What was accepted was plaintiffs'

initial -QUESTION:

I understand, but you know what I am talk­

ing ahou t„

MR. BERMAN:

language with a modified request.
QUESTION:
MR. BERMAN:

Yes.
Yes, if their request had been accepted

and you disregarded the then 18,000 shareholders —
QUESTION:
MR. BERMAN:

People who had sold.
-- who had sold, which incidentally by

now, of course, as I mentioned yesterday, there were many times
that amount, since there had been some 43 million shares —QUESTION:

Then the notice problem would have been

relatively simple?
MR. BERMAN:

Then it would have been relatively

simple because you have narrowed it to a much smaller group.
QUESTION:

And because they would have been identi­

fied on the existing list, that is the main point.
MR. BERMAN:

But of course, that is assuming that it

didn't also go to all the non-class members who were share­
holders who would then decide that there was a lot of wicked­
ness going on here and accelerate the rush for redemption of
shares with great harm to the enterprise, and so forth.
Again, there is an ignoring of the fact that the
basic important records that wouId have to be resorted to by
the transfer agent, as I said yesterday, and I hope you will
forgive the repetition, are those paper ledger sheets, not
tapes, that they have to start with, those transactions, those
daily transaction sheets which were recorded in *68 and '69,
every sale and every purchase and every transfer of shares.
The transfer agent said it would be great work to get them out
of the warehouse, but we will get those out of the warehouse
and we will then proceed to have these keypunch operators, we
are going to hire a keypunch machine, hire operators and they
are going to have to make a card for each purchase of shares
and we have estimated that there are 300,000 such transactions,
300,000 keypunch cards will have to be prepared, and from those
cards we will -then proceed to make magnetic tapes and then
those macrnetic tapes which will have those transaetions and
the account numbers will then combine with other magnetic
tapes and go on and after eight programs we will have the list
we finally want.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The

35
case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
