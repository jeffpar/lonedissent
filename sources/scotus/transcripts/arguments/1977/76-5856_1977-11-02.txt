P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 76-5856, Holloway against Arkansas.
Mr. Hall, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD L. HALL, ESQ.
On Behalf of Petitioners
MR. HALL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
There is one question presented — one point of
law presented to the Court for consideration today and that
is, whether the Petitioners were denied effective assistance
of counsel by the order of the trial court, appointing a public
defender to represent three defendants at the same trial
over their objections.
Prior to the trial, a motion for severance and
separate counsel was filed by the Public Defender with the
court and it was overruled.
Before the start of the trial, on the day of the
trial,, counsel for the Petitioners made oral motion which was
denied.
The trial started and during the direct examination
of one: of the Petitioners, another Petitioner who was sitting
at the counsel table objected to the question, to which the
court overruled and said, "Your attorney will make any
objections in your behalf."

4
Well, at that time, the Public Defender was asking
the witness a question, which the witness also happened to be
a co-defendant and he was unable to make an objection on be­
half of the Petitioner Holloway because he was also his
attorney, and attorney for the witness,
QUESTION:

Was there any difference in the general

nature of the defense as between and among these defendants?
MR» KALL:

Well, sir, prior to going into court,

there was but then when the Court says, "You will represent
all three, you cannot cross-examine your own witness, which
happens to be a defendant." X had to change my plans and I
could lot cross-examine my own witness to bring out incrimin­
ating evidence against he or the other two co-defendants.
QUESTION:

Did you make any proffer that the

witness was inherently a hostile witness and ask for crossexamination under the Hostile Witness Rule?
MR. EMI:
aIsoo

No, sir.

Because he was my client,

All three.
QUESTION:

Well, that would not necessarily bar

that scoffer with an explanation of why one witness might be
hostile with respect to another.
HALL s

But 1 had bean admonished by the Court

not to cross-examine my own witness.
examine.

I could not cross-

X believe his exact words were, "You have no right.

to cross-examine your own witness."

Then he told me to

5
proceed like he told me to.
QUESTION;

What was their defense?

Was it alibi

They testified., over my objections --

defense?

I mean, over my advice and denied being there, which I coaid
not state to the Court what they had told me in confidence.
In discussing the case with them, I talked to
each one individually, as they requested.

And so anything

one of them told me was out of the hearing of the other two.
QUESTION;

Mr. Hall, do I understand that the

respective alibi defenses were not incompatible, however?
MR. HALL;

No, sir.

QUESTION;

In

Arkansas, is a co-defendant per­

mitted cross-examination of .another defendant when, he takes
the stand?
MR. HALL;
are, yes, sir.

If they have separate counsel they

This is the first instance that I have come

across where I have been appointed to represent three over
my objections where there was a conflict of interest, in my
opinion.
QUESTION;

But it is clear that if they have

separate counsel, they may cross-examine?
MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

After the Court told me to proceed, as he had
told rne to, we went on.

1 was abiding by the ABA standards

6
that a lawyer should decline to act for more than one defen­
dant if there is a possible conflict but in this case, the
Public Defender *— we had to go ahead and take the three and
then make our motions to the Court.
At no time did the Court ever ask me to define
what the conflict of interest was.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Hall, do you want a per se rule?

.Are you asking for this, that one counsel may not represent
more than one co-defendant?
MR. HALL;

Well, sir, if there is no conflict and

after the attorney investigates and there is no conflict,
why, I have represented more than one; since that time.
QUESTION;

What happsns?

You have^how many Public

Defenders Offices do you have in Little Rock?
do you not?

Just one,

f.
MR-. HALL;

We just have one and three of us to

handle the whole area, the district of two counties.
QUESTIONt

Doss that mean that if you represented

one of these co-defendants that your office could not re­
present any of the others?
MR. HALL:

Well, there only being three Public

Defenders in the office, our files are all mingled together.
We have one secretary to type it up and that makes it kind
of hard to keep one file privileged from the other.
QUESTION;

So it would mean that the Court would

7
have to gc outside your office to appoint for the co-defen- dants, then?
MS. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Go back to the old system.

MR. HALL;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

But you do, I take it, insist that if

the attorney requests it, that ha should be relieved of a
joint representation.
MR. HALL:

Yes, sir, I think he should.

QUESTION;

To that extent, it is a per se rule you

are submitting.
MR. HALL;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Well, should it be just a request or a

request accompanied by a representation such as you did make
here that there were inherent conflicts which would impair
the

defense of each?
MR. HALL:

Your Honor, I filed a written motion

and two oral motions and each one of the defendants s.t the
trial got up and requested separate counsel and a severance.
QUESTION;

But the Chief Justice asked whether you

must also say that there is a conflict, in your opinion.
MR. HALL:

Yes, sir, there was.

QUESTION:

Well, must you then go on and detail

what the conflict might be?
MR. HALL:

Well, the Court did not ask rae and he

8

told me to proceed on, like he had fcold

me, not to cross-

examine my own witness.

me what the

QUESTION:

He did not ask

Well, I know, but

do you think the rule should be?

in this case, what

That you should have to

reveal what the conflict is, or that just your representation
is enough?
MR, HALL:

No, sir, I think there should be one

separate attorney for each defendant because if the attorney
reveals what his clients told him in confidence to the Court
• or anyone, than he loses his respect from his client and the
freedom there that he would go in and converse with him fur­
ther in the matter.
QUESTION;

Well, you have to go that far in this

case — pursuing Mr. Justice Blackmun’s inquiry, is it not
sufficient for you to say to the Court that in these circum­
stances, it was an abuse of discretion after you had repre­
sented that a conflict existed.
You said that you have since then represented
co~de fenda fits .
\::tr

MR. HALL:

Yes, air, where there has bean no

conflict of interest to either one and both asked for it«,
QUESTION:

Then wasn't it enough if you show a

claim, an abuse of discretion by the trial judge?
MR, HALL:
mind made

In this one he pretty well had his

up, YOur Honor, that we was going on and I had to

go as the Court said or be in contempt.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hall,, are funds available in. Arkan­

sas for the retention of outside counsel in a case like this?
MR. HALL:

Your Honor, at the present time we

are paid a fee on each case that, we try or are appointed on,
which goes into a fund.

When the fund fills up, they pay cur

salaries.
Now, that fee is $350 maximum with $100 for inves­
tigation if we use investigators.
If they was to appoint three different attorneys,
it would not cost the county.

Well, it would cost the county

because they pay us to represent three, we still get one
fee.

We would, if we had additional counsel, be paid more

but we are paid on a per case basis and it goes into the
fund and then they pay our salaries and office expanses out
of that.
QUESTION:

And that fund would foe available to

pay an outside counsel.
MR. HALL:

No, sir, the way the ordinance --

QUESTION:

Well, if your motion had been granted,

where would the lawyers have come from and who would have
paid -them?
MR. HALL:

It would have come out of the Gotmi..

general fund.
QUESTION:

The general fund?

10

MR, HALL:

Which they have a certain amount set

aside per year.
QUESTION:

That answered my question.

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hall?

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

As I read the State Supreme Court's

opinion in this case, they found there was no prejudice
resulting from the failure to appoint separate counsel.

Do

you attack that finding or do you say that notwithstanding
, that finding you are entitled to a reversal here?
MR. HALL:

I could not show them the prejudice with

out revealing the information my clients had told me and 3'
could not tell the Court or bring it out that they had told
me contrary to what they testified on the stand.
QUESTION:

How about telling the Supreme Court of

It was closed.

They went in a back door and

One man stayed at the top of the stairs.

Two of the men went to the room vrhere they were
.counting the money fcr receipts for the day and there they
robbed them, and two of the men raped two of the girls.
Now, there was no testimony that a. third man
raped them.

There were just two of them.

Each one was

II
raped twice and they testified it was by the same two.
Now, there is a question as to who was accomplice
there and who was involved in the rapes downstairs.

I had

that information and I could not cross-examine the ones that
did it.
QUESTION;

But did you tell what you have said in

response to my question just now, did you make that point to
the Supreme Court of Arkansas when you were arguing it?
MR. HALL;

No, sir, because it was not in the

testified.
QUESTION:

Why can you bring it out to us in a

way that you cannot —
MR. HALL;

I have not mentioned any names.

Well, but could you not have done the

same thing in the Supreme Court of Arkansas?

QUESTION;

This was not orally argued.

MR. HALL;

No, sir, and they did not ask me the

Mr. Hall, I am rather bothered the way
You are presenting a constitutional

12
issue iere and that means that we have to evolve some: stan'
dards.

I take it in your colloquy with the other justices

that you are really asking for a per se rule.

Am I not

correct?
This Court has never gone that far before.

We

certainly did not do it in the Glasser case.
MR. HALL:

Mo, sir.

QUESTION:

But you feel this is the only way to

handle it here.
MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

But only if the attorney demands separ-

ate representation.
MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Representing that there? is a conflict.

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Is it enough, then, that he demands it

Or do you think he should —
MR. HALL:

The attorney and the defendants also.

QUESTION:

Yes, but do you think he

should cone

up with something more than an allegation of conflict?
MR. HALL:

Well, if they was proof.

I mean, you

had to put on that it was of the confidential information
class.

I do not think it should be to the trial judge.
QUESTIONj

Well, in this case the trial judge did

not ask for it, did he?

MR. HALL;

He did not ask for anything.

MR, HALL;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

But you see, I am corning back to stan­

Is it enough merely to make the request?

Or must the

request be. accompanied by at least a proffer, as the Chief
was indicating?
«

And I would be interested in where

you think the

perimeters of this constitutional issue should be drawn.
MR. HALL;

Well, if there is a proffer of proof,

. it would have to be kept where the defendants' communications,
privileged communication to his attorney would be kept mute
and it is hard to — with different trial judges, it is hard
to —• >ne of them will discuss a matter and let something
slip where another' one would not.
QUESTION;

Well, on© way out would be this in

for that?
MR. HALL;

if it was a different judge, a judge that is not hearing the
case.
QUESTION

What was to prevent you from representing

to the trial judge, with or without an invitation from the
trial judge, exactly what you have responded now, without

MR« HALLs

I feel that the Court would remember

I was never asked by the trial judge or the -QUESTION s

My question to you now was, why could

you not make that representation to the judge but decline to
* identify which person was at the head of the stairs and so
forth?

Just as you have not disclosed that to us.
Was there anything to prevent you from doing that?
MR. HALL:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

But Mr. Hall, the record does show that

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

That was right here,,

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

And if you had been asked before, you

would have given it.
MR. HALL:

I would have told the same thing I have

told here this morning.
QUESTION:

It is not the role of the defense

counsel to he bashful in presenting his points in either this
" Coart or a trial court —- do you think?
MR. HALL;

No, sir.

QUESTION;

Mr. Hall, you did, if I understand the

record correctly, you did represent to the trial judge -—
you did not just ask for a separate lawyer — you did repre­

So your rale that you ask for is one

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

You have referred to the American Bar

Standards on this subject.

In those standards, is there not

Defender in a Public Defender office is presented with the
problem that you have, that then none of the members of that

MR. HALL:

That is right.

QUESTION:

Is that not true in most standards?

MR. HALL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

In other words, for those purposes,

the Public Defender's staff is treated just as though it
were a law firm.
MR. HALL:

One firm, yes, sir.

That is all I have.
MR. CHIEF «JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, thank you,

Mr, Hall.
Mr. Purvis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH H. PURVIS, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. PURVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court?
The Stats of Arkansas here would submit that there
are really but two issues.

The first is whether, in fact, a

conflict of interest did exist here

and the second or

broader issue is, if the issue of conflict arises, who bears
the responsibility for making that decision?
The Glasser decision that this Court in 1942
merely stated that ineffective assistance of counsel was
given where an attorney was representing conflicting interest
and the majority of jurisdictions in this country have held
that it is not an imaginary conflict that is spoken of, but

17
that it must, be shown that there is, in fact, some real con­
flict, something more than a possibility of conflict.
The State of Arkansas submits that the defense
counsel here submitted a petition for separate counsel that
stated merely that the "possibility of conflict existed."
Prior to trial, the trial court held a hearing on
this motion, in an effort to ascertain what, if any, conflict
existed.
We are not blessed in the record with a transcript
of that hearing.

However, the Court did find at the conclu­

sion that there was no conflict.
QUESTION':
conflict?

Where is that ruling that there was no

Where the judge said there was no conflict.
MR, PURVIS:
QUESTION:

The judge denied his motion for.
But where in the record is it that the

judge said, "There is no conflict"?
MR, PURVIS:

I don't know, Mr. Justice Marshall,

1 don't know that the Court elucidated those exact words,
but the Court — the Trial Court continually stood ready to
hear evidence of some conflict and there was none that really
existed here.
The defendants were not precluded any defense.
They all alleged alibi defenses that were certainly not in­
consistent.

They testified to tills effect.
There is no indicia that the defense counsel

18

could not have gone forward and made such a

proffer.

Now, the defense counsel has set forth some very
nice standards dealing with confidentiality and lawyer confi­
dences but. it seems to me that he overlooks the fact that,
number one, this case in particular involved no conflict,
that ha very easily could have outlined to the Trial Court
the general nature of the conflict and did not have to divulge
confidential information to the Court in order to show that
a conflict existed but apparently the defense counsel never
made that impression or conveyed that to trie Court and the
state would certainly submit that there was no confli.ct that
existed here.
Counsel made a great deal of the fact that he was
unable to cross-examine his witnesses,

Indeed, there was

nothing to be gained by the cross-examination of them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Purvis, let me ask you a question

about the practical preparation for the trial.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Supposing that one of the men was at

the top of the stairs.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And the lawyer made the judgment that

it would be better for that particular defendant to tell the
whole truth, explain that he was there at the top of the
stall's, the other two men were at the bottom of the stairs

13

and did -cite other things.
Could the lawyer, consistently with his obligation
to the other two people, advise that defendant to take that
posture at the trial?
MR, PURVIS:

I think had defense counsel done so5

sir, he certainly wotild have made a case of conflict, and he
could have merely outlined the —
QUESTION:

Could he have done that while he was

representing all three?

Could he have said, "X advise you,

who was the man at the top of the stairs, I think

you ought

to tell the whole truth,"
MR. PURVISs

I think he should have gone to the

Court when he perceived this conflict.

That is the nature of

the state's position, that asking for an early hearing and
explaining this without dealing in the specifics of confi­
dential information,
QUESTION:

But in order to go to the Court, would

he have not found it necessary to explain to the Court that
• these men were really guilty?

Would

that not have been

necessary in order to tell the Court about the problem?
MR, PURVIS s

Mo, sir, I think he could have gone

to the Court and explained,“Your Honor, I have one of ray
t

three clients who wishes tc testify and his defense is — or
the essence of his testimony would be totally antagonistic.
It will be exculpatory and it will cast the shadow of doubt

20

and try to thrust the guilt on the other two.”
I do not think that he has divulged or has conceded
that any or all are guilty.

He has merely spoken of what his

client will testify.
I think then, if the Court knows this — and I
think certainly here, had the Trial Court known this, it
would have granted the motion for separate counsel.
QUESTIONS
MR

PURVISs

QUESTION:

This would be before the trial?
Yss, sir.
Well, v/hat would happen if that deve­

loped in the middle of the trial?
MR. PURVIS?

I think if it develops in the middle

of the trial and the state does not refuta the position, if
at any time during the trial it can be shown that a conflict
actually exists, then I think the

Trial Court has the duty

to declare a mistrial if it is in trial —
QUESTION:

Then what do you do with double

jeopardy?
MR. PURVIS;
QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:

Arguably, due to —
Then it would be arguably?
Yes, sir.
All right.
It, is a vary grave danger here tout I

think the Court would have no duty but — or no choice but
to declare a mistrial.

QUESTION:-

Do you contend that the motion made at

the opening of the trial, which was a renewed motion, was
untimely?
MR» PURVIS:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I simply think that —
And you think the Court corractly said

*

that the inability to cross-examine a co-defendant who wants
to testify is an insufficient reason for separate counsel?
MR. PURVIS:

Mr. Justice White, there was no

indication, and the Court had no indication — the Court was
not advised as to even tha real nature of the potential
conflict here.
QUESTION:

All right, so 3/our answer is no —

that the Court was told that the defendants were going to
testify.
MR. PURVIS:

He was told that there was a possi-

, bility, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

A possibility?

They got up and said

they were going to testify.
MR. PURVIS:

Nov?, that was at the close of the

state’s case.
QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Well —
But tha Court had no information
That is right.

That is when it was

but you do not say that that motion was untimely, do you?
MR. PURVIS:

Not necessarily, no.

22
QUESTIONS

The Court did not say it was.

MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Biit ha just denied it.

MR, PURVIS:
QUESTION:

That is right, because the Court —
And he said, apparently the inability

to cross-examine is insufficient reason to —
MR. PURVIS:

Because the Court had no information

before it that the;re would be anything that would be antagon
istic or indicative of conflict at that time,
QUESTION:

Well, he did say, the Court did say,

of interest."

There is nc conflict

That is what the Court ruled.

MR. PURVIS:

Based on the information that the

Court had at that time, which was miniscule — merely that
there was a possibility of a conflict of interest.
QUESTION:

You do net think it would be ari appro­

priate rule that a court would be obliged to accept the
representation'of a member of the Bar, if he tendered that
as a member of the Bar and as an officer of the court? that
is not enough?
MR. PURVIS:

I think, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

Justice, that the trial court bears a very grave responsi­
bility and any such decision,such as this needs to be made
by an independent authority.
The state contends that the burden for bringing

•

23
up conflict of interest certainly lies with the members of
the Bar but it is the ultimate responsibility of the

trial

judge, the impartial, independent trial judge, to receive the
information outlining the nafcurs of the conflict and then to
make a decision as to whether a conflict does, in fact,
exist and if one does exist, than I think the duty is to
appoint separate counsel.
QUESTIONS

But there is no question that he did

deny him the right to cross-examine the other defendants.
MR... PURVIS;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, but there was nothing
But ha did it.

MR. PURVIS;

He did do that but there was nothing

to show that there was anything antagonistic and in fact,
their allied defenses were entirely compatible.
QUESTIONs

I cannot reach that conclusion as

rapidly as you can because I do not know what information
defense counsel has and I submit, I do not think you do,
either.

You do not know what he wanted to cross-examine on

because he was never allowed to.
MR. PURVIS:

No, sir, but this goes --- the state

would continue —
QUESTION;

Do you know what ha wanted to cross-

representations.

After his

24
MR. PURVIS:

I think we do now, Mr. Justice

Marshall and 1 think that, had defense counsel made a dis­
closure of this nature at the notion hearing, the Court would
have known.
QUESTION:

And if he had been asked, he would

have made it.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Asked?
The first time any judge asked him the

reasons was Justice Rehnquist and he immediately gave him the
answer and two, he stood there and said, if any other judge
would have asked him, ha would have told him.
MR. PURVIS:

Yes, sir, but we unfortunately are

not blessed with the hearing on the motion.
QUESTION:

But you are blessed with the record

which says you cannot cross-examine.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:

Yes, sir.
We are blessed with that.
Yes, sir.

But v/e would say that

there is nothing in there to indicate that the judge or any­
one knew of any reason why cross-examination would prove that
issue.
QUESTION:

He was not interested.

The judge said,
\

quote — what did lie say, now?
As I remember it, the judge said, "You know you
cannot do it."

That is all he said.

The judge did not give

25
any reason for it»

Am I right?

MR» PURVIS:

No, sir»

QUESTIONHe just says, "You cannot crossexamine your own witness»”
MR. PURVIS:
your own witness.8*

He said, "You cannot cross-examine

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Well, when he said that, was he arti­

culating the traditional rule about examining your own
witness?
MR. PURVIS:

I think that is what he was referring

to, Your Honor, because Arkansas had not adopted the Uniform
Rules of Evidence until July 1st, 1976, which was approxi­
mately ten months after this trial date.
QUESTION:

Dees Arkansas in the state courts per­

mit examination of a witness even when the witness has been
called by counsel, if there is some representation of his
being or her being a hostile witness?

MR, PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
It is the usual rule.
Yes, sir.
Well, did that apply here?
There was no —He says,

8You cannot cross-examine.81

There was no showing of —
So he denied him that right, did he not?

26
MR. PURVIS:

Yes, sir.

At the time of this trial,

Arkansas was operating under the old, traditional rules of
evidence that unless you could show or have the Court; declare
your witness to be a hostile witness, you were not entitled
to cross-examine your own witness.
The Court, it is our position, stood ready at all
times to receive sufficient information to let it be able to
declare him a hostile witness and show that there was a
conflict.
QUESTION:

Your brother’s point is that, he was

charged with representing that defendant, that witness.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Lastly, it would have been wholly

inconsistent with his representation of that defendant for
him to set out to cross-examine him and show that he was a
liar.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:
impossible dilemma.

Yes, sir, that is what —
So he was put in — his claim is

an

He was representing that defendant.

It

would have been wholly inconsistent with his defense of that
man to cross-examine him and show that his testimony was
untrue, would it not?
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION;

out to US.

Yeas, sic, but apparently —
That was the dilemma that he pointed

27
MR. PURVISs

Apparently# we are not given and do

not know an(j certeiinly cannot tell from the record what line
of defense the defense would have taken# had there been separ­
ate counsel or had there even bean allowed cross-examination.
There was nothing to show any inconsistency.
QUESTION;

Well# his point is that — not that it

was not allowed# but that# forced as he was to represent all
three# he could not# conscientiously, cross-examine any single
one of them and try to — which would have been damaging to
his own clients.
MR. PURVIS:

Yes# sir# but I think in order to do

that# you have the presumption that there is a conflict which
would necessitate or give benefit from the cross-examination.
And there was nothing in the record to note that such
existed at that time,
QUESTION:

Does Arkansas traditionally follow the

rule followed in many places# that if the client testifies
falsely# then counsel — even his own counsel must riot pursue
or aid that witness in any way?
Is that accepted in Arkansas?
MR. PURVIS:

I cannot answer that# Your Honor.

I

do not -- I believe that it is.
QUESTION:
whatever flaws

But you do recognise that at that stage

there may have been in the conduct of the

defense counsel in not. pressing the matter in the first

28

instance, when he got into trial, that he was presented with
an extremely difficult set of alternatives, was he not?
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
If he was going to try to help the man

who was the look-out man at the head of the stairs — and
presumably that is the man he was primarily concerned with.
MR. PURVIS:

Of course, then, too, under the

Arkansas law, the mere fact that he was at the

head of the

stairs instead of the actual rapist would have had no bearing
on his guilt of the two crimes or the two charges •— actually
three rapes — because he was just as guilty as those who
perpetrated the —•
QUESTION:

That may be true as a matter of law

but a jury might have taken a different view, for example,
and found the look-out man guilty of lesser charges than
finding such to the others.
MR. PURVISs

Is that not so?

That is true, Your Honor, hut here

f'
again, there is no indication that any of the defendants in
this case had any — or obeyed any inkling of ever choosing
to confess and turn state's evidence or admit to any facet
of this crime and the state would contend that were there some
indicia in the record that one wished to do so
QUESTION:

But there again, when these three men

had one common counsel, that counsel, the Public Defender,
was in pretty difficult position to go and negotiate with

29

the prosecutor for a guilty plea on a lesser included offense
for the man at the head of the stairs.
Is that not so?
MR. PURVIS:

Yes, sir, but there have been

decisions from the various circuit courts that hold, merely
because the evidence is stronger as to one or merely because
the defense counsel is precluded one particular line of
questioning or defense, -chat that does not necessari3.y give
rise to a conflict.
QUESTION;

Would you agree that the Arkansas

Supreme Court did not explore these questions as extensively
■

as they

have been explored here this morning?
MR, PURVIS:

the Arkansas

Yes, sir and I think simply because

Court did not have the information before it

that this Court has.
QUESTION:

And did not have oral argvanents.

Is

that right?
MR. PURVIS;

No, sir, they did not.

oral argument is not a matter of course.

In Arkansas,

It generally must

be sought by the party who is the Appellant, or one of the
two parties.

They usually have the right to do so but —

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, 1 understood you

to say that none of these defendants confessed.

Bit I thought

Campbell did confess.
MR. PURVIS:

Ho, sir, I did not say that none

30

confessed.

But Mr» Campbell vehemently denied making the

statement, committing the crime or ever having even been in
the restaurant.
QUESTION:

But his confession was introduced into

evidence.
HR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

His oral statement, yes, sir.
Yes.

And in that statement, although

he implicated the co-defendants, their names were stricken
from the confession —*
MR, PURVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:

That is true, sir.
— as introduced.
And then he took the stand and vehe­

mently denied, as he had done at the de novo hearing and
previously.
QUESTION:

Should he receive — should it occur

that he would receive a new trial now, I suppose some of
them may have opened themselves up to charges of perjury in
their original trial,
MR. PURVIS;
QUESTION:
MR, PURVIS:

Presumably so, sir.

Yes, sir.

At least it is a possibility.
It is a possibility, but the charge

of perjury is one that is rarely applied — or rarely tried
in the State of Arkansas, at any rate.

I am not meaning to

east any doubt on the jury system or the system of the
people in the State of Arkansas, but in a matter such as this

31
I think certainly they would be.
If this Court reversed, I think certainly they
would be retried for their crimes but the state would once
again contend that there really was no reversible error here
because there was no conflict and if counsel might speak
further as to the per se rule advocated by the amici and
apparently by the defense counsel, the state would reiterate
that

it wholeheartedly opposes such, because such a per se

rule is premised on the idea or on the belief that there is
conflict every time multiple defendants are represented by
sole counsel *—
QUESTION

%

Well, that is not what the contention

is, as far as 1 can see and he does not ask that there is any
flat

rule against multiple representation.
MR. PURVIS:

I think in one of the amici briefs,

such was ““
QUESTION:

Well, you said that you attributed the

same view to your colleague, here.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:
that way.

Yes, sir, I did.
And 1 do not understand his submission

His submission is that if the attorney makes a

representation and in his view, in his professional judgrsent,
there is a conflict, then there should be separate represen­
tation.

That is not a per se rule.
MR, PURVIS;

Well, the state would oppose that

32
rule as well, Your Honor because; I think* in addition to the
other summary* it certainly places in the hands solely

- in

other words* it divests from the Trial Court the making of
a constitutional decision and it removes the Trial Court or
divests it from the supervising protectionary power that it
exercises as to the defendant,
QUESTION:

You think that the Trial Judge should

be entitled to require counsel, in supporting his judgment*
to reveal confidential information imparted to him by a
client,
MR, PURVIS:

Mr. Justice White* I do not think

that such confidence- revelations are necessary in but a very*
very few miniscule cases.
QUESTION;
MR. PURVIS:

Well* how about answering my question?
Yes, sir, I think* if necessary, if a

counsel strongly believes that there is a conflict and it
would necessitate, I think, disciplinary rule 1-1Q$(c)(2), I
believe it is, would allow for that for the revelation of
confidences when so ordered by the Court,
QUESTION:

Mr, Attorney General, what is sc wrong

with having individual counsel?
MR, PURVIS:

Oh* I see nothing that is wrong

with it. Your Honor,
QUESTION:

The way you

keep arguing it and you

keep resisting it* it seams like it is something horrible.

33
MR. PURVIS:

No, sir, I do not,

In fact, I think —

certainly I know if I —QUESTION:

You think it is good?

MR. PURVIS:
QUESTIONS

It is good.
All right,

MR. PURVIS:

But by the same token, I do not

think that you have done anything wrong,

I do not think that

the Constitution has been violated by the multiple representa­
tion until you can show some actual conflict.
And I would simply close by saying that the state's
position as to what should be the rule as to the determina­
tion of conflict is outlined in the conclusionary part of
our brief.
Are there any further questions by the Court?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Apparently not.

Mr. Hall, do you have anything further?
MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor.,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
