Mr. Rya n.
ORAL A RGUMLNT OF A JEN A „ RYAN. ESQ.,
oN BEHALF OF THIS PETITIONER
MR. RYAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

C ou rfc :
This case is before the Court on cross motions for
entry of a third supplemental decree.

The areas in dispute

are two one-mile belts of water and submerged lands, surrounding
the two islands which together comprise the channel Islands
Nationa1 Monument.
X invite the Court's attention to page 68 of the
Appendix, the beige document,, which contains a diagram or a
map of the area in dispute and the surrounding area.
Auacapa Island is about 12 miles offshore and Santa
Barbara Island about 35 miles offshore the Coast of California,
%

The islands themselves are about 40 miles apart.

These islands

were established as the Channel Islands National Monument in
1938 by Presidential Proclamation of President Roosevelt.

In

1949s both jar ties agree, President Truman in a Presidential
Proclamation expanded the monument by adding to it — and I
quote from his proclamation which is on page 6j of the Appendix
adding to it. quote, "the areas within one nautical mile of

4
the shoreline of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Island, as indicated
or the diagram,' end quote.

The diagram being that on page 68.

The United states believes that by this language
President Truman added to the monument everything within one
mile of each of the islands«
QUdbTlC'N:

At the time of President Truman's procla­

mation, referring to this diagram — this is the identical
diagram to which you referred, is it?
Ml. RYAN:

Yes. Mr, Justice Stewart.

QUESTION:

And this was attached and made a part of

the proclamation?
MR» RYAN:

Specifically, it was, yes. sir.

We believe that that proclamation added to the monument everything within one mile of the shoreline, waters, submerged lands and natural resources.

This conclusion is sup­

ported not only by the words and the diagram of the proclama­
tion itself, but by the Executive history of the proclamation.
California contends that President Truman added only
recks and islets within one mile of the islands, although
California candidly concedes that both the language and the
Executive history of the proclamation do not unequivocally
support its reading.
If this Court decides that President Truman did,
indeed, include the waters and submerged lands within one mile
in his proclamation, it must then decide the second issue

5
presented by this case, that is, did the submerged Lands Act
of 1953 cede these lands and waters to. California, as
California contends, or were they exempted by Section 5
of that Act, which provides that the United States will
retain lands occupied by claim of right.
As to the first issue, the primary dispute between
the parties centers on what President Truman meant by the
wcrd "areas11 when he added, quote,

"the areas within one

nautical mile of the shorelines," end quote, of the two islands.
The word "areas" if, of course, far more inclusive than the
specific words "rocks and islets, " and California has yet to
suggest why, if President Truman had intended to include only
rocks and islets, he would have used such an expansive and in­
accurate word as "areas."

Furthermore, the map or diagram on

page 68, which was incorporated by reference into the proclamation, shows a boundary line running one mile around both
islands, with acreage figures that describe the total surface
area of the islands and of one mile of water surrounding the
islands.
Finally, the diagram does not depict a single rock
or islet within the boundary line, except for some rocks that
lie a few hundred yards off the shore of Santa Barbara and,
obviously, no one-mile boundary was necessary to include them.
California has yet to explain why a proclamation that
was designed to include rocks and islets within the boundaries

6
o: the monument omitted to describe or depict those objects.
In all. we believe it clear that the proclamation did
exactly what it said it was doing, adding all areas within one
mile of the islands, and that "areas" cannot be reasonably under­
stood to mean merely some rocks and islets, but must mean the
waters, lands, natural resources, in short, everything within
one mile of the two islands,
The parties have collected the various letters, memos
and other materials which led up to the signing of this proclam­
ation, sort of legislative history, as it were, and if any doubt
as to the scope of the proclamation exists this history certainly
removes it.

In a nutshell, this history reveals that after

President Roosevelt established the Channel Islands National
Monument in 1938 by reserving the islands themselves,, it was
almost immediately realized that those boundaries were inadequate
to protect the wide variety of marine mammaIs and plant life
that thrived in the waters around the islands.

Federal offi­

cials and naturalists agreed that Federal jurisdiction should
extend into the water.

But at that time California and the

United States were engaged in litigation before this Court to
determined tie three-mile belt around the — beyond the Coast
of California,

And these islands, I might add, politically,

are a part of the State of California, so that the three-mile
question at issue involved these islands.
In view of the conflicting claims that were then

7
before the Court, the United States during this period of the
mid-forties took no definitive action to expand the monument,
because there was doubt that it had the legal power to do so,
regardless of how advisable such action might have been from
a natura1ist standpoint.
That question, of course, was settled by this Court
in 1947 in favor of the United States, when this Court held
in the first California decision that the United States had
paramount rights over the lands, minerals and other things in
the Pacific Ocean lying seaward of the low water mark.
QUiiSTlON:

Does that mean that you concede that there

was no claim at all before the '47 decision, that the, U.tc
had no claim at all before 1947?
MR. RYAN:

No, 1 would not take that position,

Mix Justice Blackmun.

Before 1947, I would say that the

question was in dispute and there was no definitive resolution.
I wouldn't

50

so far as to say we had no claim.

I think our

claim — the United States' claim that was placed before the
court in California won.
QX-BTION:

But I take it that if the '47 case had

come out the other way, you would say you had no claim.
Ml. RYAN:

If the '47 case had corae out the other

way, we would have no claim, in 1949 -QUEST1 ON:

monument set up there.

3
MR.- RYAN:

It could not have been expanded in the

way that President Truman did so.

And if President Eisenhower

had tried to do this in 1959,- after the submerged Lands Act was
passed, it would not be possible.

It was only in that period

of time prior to the Submerged Lands Act that the United States
had claim to this territory.

How far back it went, in response

to Mr. Justice Blackmun ~~
QUESTION:

Well.- immediately before, the Submerged

Lands Act, while the *47 decision was still ruling the waves,
what was the difference between the United States' claim with
•*

respect to the seabed underlying the national monument and the
adjoining seabed?
MR. RYAN:
matter of law.

There was really no difference, as a

The only difference for these purposes is that

by making it a national monument that gives it certain protect i on.
QUESTION:

I guess you were just gping to tell me

then why the Submerged Lands Act didn't treat both pieces of
the seabed the same.
MR. RYAN:

It did not because of the claim of right

Had it not been for the claim of right exception,

QUESTION:

But both areas would be under claim of

MR. RYAN:

No.

right,
The area

9
QUUSTICN:

Well, United States can't do any more than

claim to own what it owns.
MR, RYAN:

That's true, but the claim of right

exception did not include those lands which the United States
owned, if you will, only by virtue of the California won decree,
the paramount rights doctrine.

The Congress specifically said

claim of right does not include that vast area of sea -QUESTION:

fxcept for that decision — you just said

if the decision had come out the other way

they wouldn’t have

owned the national monument either.
MR. RYAN:

Well, they would have oivned the island,

but had the decision come out the other way, I don't think that
President Truman in 1949 could have simply reserved this area
and said, "I proclaim it a national monument."

He may have

been able to proceed by eminent domain or other fashion.
QUESTION:

Is that how the Government acquired the

islands in the first place, by eminent domain?
MR, RYAN:

The islands were a Federal monument -~

excuse me, Federal territory, lighthouse territory, at least
as far back as 1854.

They have been in Federal hands at least

since that date when they were used as lighthouses.
QUESTION:

That is ownership of the real estate?

MR, RYAN:

Yes, sir.

Q Uj U TION:

The entire isla «3 ?

MR, RYAN:

The entire island, at least down to the

10
high water mark.
QUESTION:

Now,

that you have mentioned high -water

mark, somewhere along here will you talk about t id e la rid s ?
Mil. RYAN:

I will talk about it right now, and say

that the United States has no claim to the tidelands.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR» RYAN:

Because the tidelands, historically, have

been considered inland waters of a state.
QUESTION:

But if you are relying on the proclamation,

proclamation didn't except the tidelands.

President Roosevelt's

initial ~~
MR. RYAN:

President Roosevelt's proclamation did

not include the tidelands,
QUESTION:

But iifc didn ‘ t exc lud e them.

MR, RYAN:

Well,

in that case,

I would have to say

that it excluded it by implication, because tidelands, at least
since the case of Pollars Lessee by this Court,

tidelands have

been considered inland waters of the Btafce. and President
Roosevelt just by proclaiming it a national monument could
not have taken the tidelands back from the State.
QUESTION:

Your reliance,

in this case, as I under­

stand it — correctly me if I am wrong — is exclusively upon
President Roosevelt's proclamation and President Truman's later
pi oc lama t ion.
MR. RYAN:

Well, as to the territory at issue here —

11

t Id elands,

QUESTION:

President Truman's —

Ml, RYAN:

President Truman.

QUESTION:

Well.,

I don't see why you don't claim the

if your reliance is on those proclamations.
OUST ION:

The result is that the State owns the

tidelands and you claim the Islands and the seabed beyond the
tide lands»
MR. RYAN:

Right.

QUESTION:

So we have a little horseshoe ownership

of the state.
QUESTION:

I don't understand that because the tide-

lands may be inland waters of the State if the State happens
to own the shore.

But the state at the time of the proclamation

didn't own the shore.

Never has.

Doesn't yet own these

islands,
MR. RYAN:

The islands, politically, are a part of

the State of California, like Nantucket is a part of Massachu­
setts .
QUESTION: Well, that may be so, but the land is
United States territory, isn't it?
MR. RYAN:

Yes,

it is.

QUESTION:

But that holds true in Po 11aid'sXessee, too.

All the land was In the possession of the United States, and
yet this Court held that United States when it alienated the
land could not alienate the tidal waters.

12

MR. RYAN:

That the tidal waters remained subject

to state jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

That may be so, but as Brother Stewart

says, the proclamation didn't say a word about tidelands.
QUESTION:

And you are relying on the proclamation.

MR. RYAN:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

So why clo you concede away the tide lands,

unless you are relying on something else.
MR, RYAN:

We concede them away, if that's what we

are doing, simply -~
QUESTION:

That's your proposed decree, excluding

the tidelands.
MR. RYAN:

VJe are not before this Court asking for

the tide lands.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. RYAN:

And the reason we are not is because, as

we read President Roosevelt's proclamation in 1938 he had
power, if you will, only to reserve the areas that the United
States controlled, and the United States did not control the
tide lands.
QUESTION:

So you say the proclamation could not

purport to take -MR. RYAN;

Could not have.

QUESTION:

— legally and constitutionally could not

take the tidelands.

13
MR* RYAN:

Could not take the tidelands.

It does

result in an odd situation, where the. United States owns the
land and one mile beyond the land and California retains the
tidelands.

I won't argue that that is the most rational result

in the world, but under current state of affairs I think that
is what is the result.
QU.J.-TION:

Well, did President Truman have more power

than President Roosevelt, or is it just that his proclamation
is more express. „
MR. RYAN:
things.

Well, they were looking at two different

He did not 'have more power.

that he did.

We are not contending

President Roosevelt reserved only the islands.

That is specific.

He said, "These two islands are reserved."

President Truman, responding to the claims and the entreaties
of naturalists and Park Service officials and others, said,
"President Roosevelt didn’t go far enough.

The lands them­

selves are not adequate to protect the marine life.

We will

have to include the waters, and so forth, the submerged lands
around there."

And he used the word "areas" to achieve that

result *
QUESTION:

So, President Truman used broader language

than President Roosevelt did.
MR. RYAN:

Well, he did, yes.

QUESTION:

If he had said,-' "the , areas including the

tidelands," you would have said that he didn't have power to

14
include the tidelands,
MR» RYAN:

X would say that right now, yes,

Where do you begin the measure?

MR. RYAN:

California raises that point in their

I don't think that is anything more than an administra­

tive problem that can be certainly worked out between the
United .states and California as to who will administer what.
QUii.~T.TON:

It is not our problem, but it does bear,

I would think, on the reasonableness of the Government's inter­
pretation of these•proclamations.
MR, RYAN:

Well. I think. Mr. Justice, that it bears

not so much on the reasonableness of our interpretation as on
the realities of the law, that is, that the United States could
not have simply appropriated those tidelands in 19;19 or at any
other time, as it appropriated what was around it.

I am sure

that had those tidelands been available, President Truman would
h;-ve included them, and that would have been the only sensible
way to do it.

But as a matter of the law, at least since

ollard 's-Lsssee, those lands were not available to the United
States.

And I would say that whatever problems are presented

rf: administration by this 6-foot, or whatever it is, section
of tidelands, are something that can be worked out between
California and the United States.

And I would agree it is not

a reason to find in California’s favor in the case.
I think it is important to note that when the
question came up, especially in the post-proclamation adminis­
tration period of this area, as to whether the Federal

16

Goveramsnfc had jurisdiction over subraerged lands, the Nationa 1
Park Pervice, which was- charged with the administration of the
area* specifically referred to the submerged lands as being
under its jurisdiction and the parties have been able to find
no evidence that California ever contested that interpretation,
California, I am sure, has looked harder for it than the United
States did, but the joint Appendix is here and there is no
question raised in these materials as to any dispute by
California at the time that Federal jurisdiction -QUrk-TlCN:

Mr. Ryan, may I ask, getting back to this

measuring point, whatever may be the width of the tideland. —
you suggest that the width was only in feet -- whatever it may
be: seaward of the islands, wherever its boundary is, of the
tideland, isn't it from that point that you measure the mile

MR, RYAN:

That 's correct.

QJE.6TI0N:

May that not — banking on tides and

e\ ery thing else. -- may that not bet jusfc — a few feet? Whatever
it ’.s California has,
MR. RYAN:

What California has is determined by the
/

line of mean lower low water, which is a statistical measurement

17

drawn out over years,

It does not vary from day to day with

that day's tides.
QUESTION:

Well, do we know what that is?

MR, RYAN:

In relation to fches© islands ?

CUKu'TION:

Yes.

MR. RYAN:

I honestly do not, Mr, Justice,and it is

not in these records.

I am sure that someone does.

It is a

fact and it is a fact that judicial notice could be taken of,
if we knew what the fact was.
QUESTION:

It is an established boundary.

MR. RYAN:

Yes,

If the Court determines in favor of the United states
that all waters and lands were included in President Truman's
proclamation, that brings up the second question in the case
which is whether the Submerged Lands Act gave this all to
C a 1if ornia in 1953,
The submerged Lands Act was enacted by Congress in
1953 to give the States title to the lands and resources lying
up to three miles seaward of their coastlines.

Had Congress

stopped there, a case could be made that the disputed area
here was relinquished to California, but Congress, for very
good reasons, did not stop there.

In Section 5(a) of the Act,

it excepted from the operation of the -net, and I quote, 'Any
rights the United states has in lands presently and actually
occupied by the United states under claim of right," end quota.

18

The parties have stipulated, for purposes of this
litigations the disputed areas here were, quote* "presently
and actually occupied within the meaning of the statute by
the United States after the 1949 proclamation."

And ao we

agree that the only issue is whether the United States occupied
them under claim of right.
Both parties agree that the legislative history of
the Submerged Lands Act shows beyond any doubt that Congress
did not include, under the claim of right exception, the socalled doctrine of paramount rights,, to which I referred a
moment earlier, which this Court announced in 1947-

The reason

that Congress made clear that claim of rights did not include
paramount righto is obvious,

ouch a construction would have

retained everything that the Congress was trying to give back.
It would have rendered the Act a nullity.
On the other hand, the reason Congress inserted the
claim of right language, in the first place, 1% equally ob­
vious.

It was giving back to the states only those areas which

the United states occupied, or where jurisdiction extended,
based on paramount rights.

It was certainly not giving to the

States Federal military bases, naval ranges, national monuments
and other areas which the Federal Government was actually using
at the time for various purposes.

Congress also did not want

to give up any claim or rights that the United states might
have to areas then in dispute.

And so it shows the language.

19

'claim of right, " to include those disputed areas, as well as
areas which the federal Government occupied without dispute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ryan, what if then President Eisenhower

after the Submerged Lands Act had passed both houses of Congress
feeling that he didn't really like the Act

but knew he had to

sign it.,, issued a proclamation proclaiming the entire threemile. coastal, zone a national monument.
signed the bidelands bill.

And then went ahead and

i;o you think that would be a claim

of right ?
MR. RYAN:

Presidential proclamation for the entire

three-mile belt beyond the Coast of California?
C'UEbTXON:

Yes.

Ml. RYAN:

X would think you would have to look first

at what authority he had to do that.

The Antiquities Act of

1S06, which is the statutory authority for these two proclama­
tions,

C think, probably could not be construed to include the

thousands of square miles, like you suggest would include; but,
assuming there was some statutory authority to do that, and
he could reserve it as a national monument, or something of
that nature, 1 -would say that that would be a claim of right.
QUESTION:

But' you said there must be statutory

authority for the President -MR. RYAN:

At a minimum, the Presidential Proclamation

has to be a valid one.

For purposes of this case, I wouldn't

want to say that a claim of right could be voided if it could

20

be shown that the statutory authority underlying it was. inSL.f f ic lent.

QUESTION:

Does that mean that both the United btates

must have had title and the President authorized to make the
proc lama t ion?
MR. RYAN:

The United States did not need title.

A claim of right is something which is generally understood
to mean something less than title.
QUESTION:

It means at least good faith and reasonable

belief that you own it, doesn't it?
MR, RYAN:

Yes.

And a claim that you own it.

QUESTION:

And what do you say is the source of the

Government claim of right in this case?
MR, RYAN:

The 1949 proclamation by President Truman.

QUESTION:

And what was the authority for him to

MR. RYAN:

The Antiquities Act of 1906.

make that?
But California

has taken the position that the Antiquities Act of 1906 does
not authorize President Truman to do as much as he did in 194-9.
Our position is, first, that “s wrong, that it did authorize him.

But, secondly, if it came to that, that we would say that that
does not void the entire Presidential Proclamation.
QUEOTION:

Then we would still have to decide that

question, wouldn't we?

The claim of right exception, if you

prevail on it, simply leaves you where you were with respect to

21

the Vc. 1 id it j of President fruman's proclamation.
Ml. RYAN:

That's right.

The claim of right exception*

time after time, in the Congressional debate was considered to
be something that neither validated nor prejudiced any claims.
And we certainly don't rely on that as validating this claim.
It's the Presidential Proclamation.

But it is difficult to

imagine a claim of right more definite and more explicit than
a statement by the President of the United states that he is
reserving these areas for purposes* statutory purposes, author­
ized by the Congress.
QUBSTICN:

What if the United .'states owned them?

MR. RYAN:

There is no dispute, I think

perhaps

1 shouldn't say that, but we think it's certainly clear that
by the doctrine of paramount rights the United states had a
right to proclaim this area in 19^9.
QUl&VUN:

Now, whether ~~

X thought the decision in California

Mr. lunge rich.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP RU&wELL IUNGERICH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF QF THE RESPONDENT
MR. IUNGERICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
1 would first like to briefly address the question
of tidelands in this case.

California bases its ownership of

t id elands on the basic doctrine enunciated first in Pollard 5s
Lessee v. Hagen and followed most recently in the Oregon v.
Corvallis Land Jg,.Gravel case.

And that is that by virtue of

the equal footing doctrine, bji virtue of our sovereignty, we
receive title to all and ownership of all tidelands within our
political boundaries.

And since our political boundaries in-

eluded, not only the coast of the mainland up to mean low water
but also the islands off shore which were within our political
Jurisdiction,

the fcidelands around these islands are also owned

by the otate of California and not the United States* as was
originally claimed In this proceeding.
QUEaTUN:

The important —

The reliance of the Government in this

case is on the proclamations.
MR, IUNGE RICH:

Yes

23

QUESTION:

While absent a proclamation, as a general

rule, you,California owns its tidelands along its shores, in­
cluding around the shores of the islands that are part of
California.

But if the whole reliance of the Government., in

its exercise of paramount rights over both these islands, and
now under President Truman's proclamation, the one-in He belt
around them — and I know that’s the basic issue in this case
why didn’t it get the tidelands under the proclamation?
MR» IUNGERICH:

It didn't get the tidelands because

we owned them and because the Antiquities Act of 1906 says
that you can only place in a national monument -QUESTION:
you?

Well, you didn’t, in fact, own them, did

You had paramount rights to them -Ml. IUNGERICH:

It was more than that, as far as the

decision in 19^7 and later cases point out, that point — the
point that was made was that we did have rights with respect
fee the tidelands that I think were broader than the rights
that the Federal Government received in 19^7 in the one-mile
belt, and tnat those rights were historic rights that even
the Federal Government recognized and did not contest in the
3.947 decision.
QUESTION:

It wasn’t belt.

I thought that under

President Roosevelt’s original proclamation, providing that
"these islands shall be a national monument," the islands are
the islands, down to the shore.

24
MR, lUNG.GRIGH:

Well., if you take a close look at the

1938 proclamation of President Roosevelt and look at the calls
of the island that are set forth, tanta Barbara Island, the
calls are only to the high water mark.
Q USc TI ON:

No,, they ar en 11,

MR0 IUNGBRICH:

Recognizing only, with regard to

Manta Barbara Island. Federal ownership down to the high water
mark and apparently recognizing our ownership of tidelands
at that point in time, there is no mention specifically with
regard to Anacapa Island, but there is that specific call in
the Santa Barbara Island portion --QUESTION:

By its own terms, at least, with respect

to Manta Barbara Island.
MR, lUNGiSRICH:

So at least as far as the tidelands

are concerned, we think that we should have a decree affirma­
tively stating that California owns those tidelands, and clearly
specifying what the shoreline of the Anacapa Island is.
The United states' proposed supplemental decree would
merely exclude them from the proclamation and not affirmatively
state that California has its rights adjudicated by this Court
and tire fact that we have the right to administer those tidelands and exercise jurisdiction over them.
That does present,

if the Federal position prevails,

this problem of what appears to be concentric rates, and we
submit that the interpretation of the 1949 proclamation which

25
the Government presents here, is an erroneous interpretation
of that proclamation, and as a matter of law the proclamation
must be construed as not to have added either the submerged
lands of the one-mile belt around each of the two islands, or
the waters of the Pacific Ocean that are above those submerged
lands.
And we submit that that follows for the following
reasons,

First of all. if we examine the use of the word

"area," the preamble to the proclamation which we referred to
to discover the intent of the President or, in this case, a
statute and the intent of Congress, only refers to the islets
and rocks that are located in the one-mile belt.

And then at

a later point in the preamble there is a reference to the area,
hereinafter described, and making it very unclear what those
areas will he.
The use of the word "areas," as we analyze the
definition of the word "areas," normally connotes surface, or
is a term of surface reference.

In other words, a two-dimen­

sional reference which in its normal usage would only include
the surface of the waters.

Indeed, there is one document that

is cited in the Federal Government's brief, which specifically
indicates an intent on the part of the National Park Service to
add only waters.

And I refer to the U,S. Brief at page 15

and their reference to Joint Appendix, page 13, a Park Service
memorandum that suggests the addition of surface areas only.

26

Now, if that's the case, we are looking here at the
possibility of only adding the surface areas of the water,
QUESTION:

Well, that's not true when you are

certainly construing a deed that's deeding land rather than
water, is it?
MI» IUNGERIGH:

Mr, Justice Rehnquist. I think the

whole continuity, all of the factors in the matter of inter­
pretation have to be taken into account.

To look at this one

isolated factor, I'd have to concede that it might be equi­
vocal one way or another.

I think looking over the entire

proclamation with all the factors that I plan to bring to the
Court's attention, and which we have brought to the Court's
attention in the brief, we really cant tell what areas were
really intended to cover.

But one thing I can say, and one

thing the Federal Government has not brought out in its brief
or here at oral argument, is the fact that throughout the
.executive history, throughout the language of either the '38
proclamation or the 19^9 proclamation, there is not one refer­
ence to the term "submerged lands" as being intended to be
added to this national monument.

There is not one reference.

And they can cite nowhere in the record to a reference to sub­
merged lands,
We submit that what they were concerned about was
protecting the marine life that was out in the water next to
these islands..

And, as we make the point, in Executive Order

27

9633 in 194|3, President Truman had already reserved the sub­
merged lands of the Continental ahelf for future legislation
so that they couldn't have been added to this monument unless
there was a repeal by implication of the

proclamation.

And that's a point that the United States does not answer.
Thfere has to have been that revocation by implication, and that
revocation by implication cannot stand here because the infor­
mation from the language of the proclamation, the information
that we have from the .executive history points in many directions
But it does not support any claim to submerge lands being added
to the monument in 19^9*

And I think that's the relevant point

here.
It suggests, at most — Well, it clearly adds the
recks and islands within the one-mile belt, because they are
named specifically in the proclamation.

And it may add the

surface areas of the water and some rights in the water areas,
but we submit, under the Antiquities Act, the waters alone
could not have been added to the monument in and of themselves
without submerged lands.
QUESTION:

When you say the surface area of the

water alone, you do agree, don't you, that to deed someone a
surface area, of land, and nothing more, is almost meaningless.
If you can't* plow a six-inch furrow in the land, it doesn’t do
you much good.
are excepted.

Most deeds convey mineral rights unless they

28

MR. lUNG-RI H:

Well, the problem here Is we have

an inartful description and it is not clear what's meant.
1 don't necessarily rely on the surface areas.

And

I am just

trying to basically grapple with what President Truman intended.
QUIilTIGN:

But isn't one of the least reasonable

constructions the argument that he intended to reserve a kind
of a film of water -MR. IUNG' RICH:

It wouldn't be the film of water -

It would have to be the bulk of the water, but not the under­
lying seabed.
QUESTION:

Aren't you reversing the ancient approach

to it.that the critical thing is the owner of the land and
what's above it and what's below it.

Now, the water is above

it here* is it not?
MR. IUNGBRICH:

But the problem is that the land

has to be expressly placed in the monument and not the water
alone,

In other words, the Antiquities Act of 1906 says that

the Government can only add the lands owned or controlled by
the Government of the United States to a national monument.
Examining the Secretary of Interior's letter to the
President, he said he wanted to add the rocks and islets and
water within one nautical mile.
to areas.

That was subsequently changed

But there is no indication that submerged lands

were intended to be added.
QUESTION:

Would you take just the reservation

29

intended to reserve the United States the right to conserve
the sea life that lives on the bottom?
MR. IUNGLRICK:

No,

The proclamation., as 1 see it.

is not intended to protect sea life.

Because Assistant

Solicitor General Washington who wrote the memo that ultimately
went to the Attorney General and was then sent to the President,
recommending approval of this proclamation, specifically dis­
avowed any intention to protect marine .Life,
QUESTION:

Let's put it this way.

If you assume that

the proclamation was intended to reserve the water, I suppose
the United states could control sea life in it?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

How about the ones living on the bottom?

MR, IUNGLRICH:
that up.

Yes.

I don't know how we would divide

I think the simple answer to that is that it is

very difficult to grapple with the actual intent of the
President in this case because it is very hard to deal with
those terms,

I think the way to resolve this problem is the

way that California has suggested.
QUESTION:

And that is simply this —•

And if United States wanted to build a

pier, or something, out from the land, they would bs trespas­
sing,
MR. IUNGBRICH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And would have no right to have anything

built out into the water, under your submission.

30

MR, .LUNG .RICH:

Yes, sir.

What I am submitting hare is that the reason, the
probable reason why this term "waters" and the word "areas" was
used was the fact that in 19^5 there had already been a reser­
vation in Executive Order 9633 of the natural resources of the
subsoil and seabed of the continental shelf, which reserved
those lands for legislation.

Being aware of that in the

department of Interior, they wanted expressly to avoid the
possibility of taking some lands out of that reservation and
placing them in the national monument.

And so they carefully

tried to draft a proclamation that avoided that result.

And

the end result is a proclamation that will not stand the test
of the Antiquities Act because it didn't add the submerged
lands underneath, because there has been no repeal
QUhoTION:

But if it doesn't withstand what you call

the test of the Antiquities Act. all that means is the
President didn't have the authority to put it in a national
monument.

It doesn't mean that the Government no longer owned

it or had a claim of right, does it?
MR, IUNGLRICH:

If it didn't — If the Government

didn't own it, it does not have a claim of right,
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, do you think under the

Antiquities Act the President could proclaim all the incorpor­
ated area v ithin the City of Santa Barbara as a national
monument because of the early friars, and so forth, even though

31

the land was owned by private citizens?
MR. IUNGBRICH:

No, I do not.

It states that the

land must either be owned or controlled by the United States.
And that means that we either have to have come type of
public domain land or we have to have a type of land that
is under the control of the United States.

The question of

title was left in doubt in the 1947 U.S, v. California decision,
and the Federal Government was awarded paramount rights and
full dominion over the natural resources of the subsurface.
But, under -.hose circumstances, what we have there is the
Government controlling those lands in the sense that it had
very broad eights.

But if the Federal Government does not

own lands or does not control them, i submit the Antiquities
Act says that the President does not have any authority of
any type to put those lands in any kind of reservation.

And

I think that's a clear statement of what Congress meant
QUiibTICN:

Bo you think the proclamation was valid

under the Antiquities Act with respect to the islands?
-MR, IUNGBRICH:

Yes, it was, because those islands

were ceded to the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hildalgo, from Mexico, and as a result based on that they were
•public domain lands.

And being public domain lands the United

States could place them in a national monument down to the high
water mark.

But it couldn't place our tidelands in there

because, by virtue of our sovereignty.in I85C the treaty of

32

Guadalupe HildaIgo was in 1348 --QUi-.TXON;

Would you say that the Antiquities Act

would have authorized the President to reserve the seabed
beyond the tidelands if he had said so expressly?
MR. IUNG3RICH:

Yes, if he had said so expressly in

1949, he could have reserved the submerged lands in that one»
mile belt.
QUESTION:

The Antiquities Act would have authorized

that?

MR. IUNG1SRICH:

Yes.

The point is it is unclear

whether he did that, because he had already reserved those
lands in Executive Order 9633«

And this order can be construed

in such a way as not repealing by implication .Executive
Order 9633#

3n<3 giving National Park r-erv'ice jurisdiction

over everything that's in the water and still reserving under
9633 submerged lands for- purposes of natural -resource develop­
ment .
QUi&JTION:

How can you profit, though, from any

imperfection in the Presidential proclamations, based on the
Antiquities Act, since, as I understand the Antiquities Act,
it’s only purpose is,Congress says, "With respect to this kind
of land that the United States owns or controls, the President
may make a national monument of it."
Supposing he didn't succeed in making a national
monument, the United .states would still own or control.

33
MR» ''UNG-.'RI.H:

No* it wouldn't* because in 1953

and that's my next point — the Submerged Lands Act relinquished
to California all Federal rights in the entire three-mile belt.
And our point is that this is not a valid claim of
right that is preserved by section 5 in the claim of right

proclamation had been as clear as I think Justice Rehnquist

You ...conceded they had the power to do that*

■MR. IUNGERICH:

They had the power to do that, but

our point is that's a claim of right resting solely upon the
paramount rights doctrine of the '47 decision.
QUESTION:

Why isn't it a claim of right, resting

on the Presidential proclamation pursuant to the Antiquities Act

MR. IUNGERICH:

That proclamation is not a claim of right.

The antecedent claim of right to a piece of property is the
source of the Federal Government's title or its source of
control of that property.
QUESTION:

That just depends on how you interpret

claim of right in the Submerged Lands Act.
MR. IUNGERICH:

Nell, I would submit that the

clear indication here is that in talking about claim of right
and looking at the legislative history which California has set
forth in detail in its brief., the purpose of this was not to
preserve reservation of this language.

It was a savings clause,

that if there was a claim that might later be brought up in
court or claim pending in court that the United States had,

QUESTION:

Suppose the Government had — there were

MR. IUNGERICH:

They were expressly covered by

another exception, Your Honor.

They were covered by 'fell lands

filled in, built up and otherwise reclaimed by the United
States for Its own use."

They were expressly thought of and

35
were not encompassed in the actual occupancy under claim of
right exception.
QUESTION:

You don rt think a Presidential proclamation

expressly reserving the seabed would have been a reservation
for its own use?
Ml. IUNGYRICH:

suppose the President tomorrow

walked into your home and announced,

"I proclaim this as a

national monument," would he have a claim of right to that
property?
QUESTION:

That isn't the situation.

In 194-9* the

Let me follow through on Justice White's

suggestion ns to piers,

suppose today United states put out

On your theory, could they

Mil. IUNGE RICH:

Our theory is that we own that

36
QULTTITN:

If you lose this ease, could they do it?

M.R» lUNGERIGH:

If we lose this case, then you will

be adjudicating that they own the submerged lands and they
could put out a pier.
QUESTION:

How would they get over your tidelands?

MR. IUNGISRICH:
QUESTION!

Well, they would have to get a permit.

Then they couldn’t do it.

MR. IUNGBRICH:

I am not saying that California

wouldn't exercise its jurisdiction to allow them a permit
across their tidelands.

But, yes, there is that intervening

area and they would have to resolve that with the State of
California.

And we clearly own those tidelands,

And, basically,

what has ha opened here is that we have a situation that is
probably an exception to all of the uniform rules that mariners
can rely on, that governments can rely on, that the States,
at the present time, are the agencies that have jurisdiction
over the three-mile belt, except around Anacapa and Santa
Barbara Islands and possibly for Jefferson National Monument
in the Try lor togas in Florida.

But those are the exceptional

situations, where the Federal Government has claimed prior

to 1Q.3 in area.
But 31 submit a reservation is not a claim of right.
A Presidential Proclamation is not a claim of right in and of
itself.

It is merely a statement by the President that !'X think

under the Antiquities Act the Federal Government owns or controls

37
this property.'

And it is merely an assertion of that by the

President of the United states.
QUESTION:

It does not create —

What Js the diff erence between a claim of

right and an assertion of right?
MR» IUNGERICH:

Well, a claim of right must have a

basis, and the basia here is the paramount rights decision in
1949.

There is no basis.

I mean a reservation is simply a

mechanical feature that’s used within the department of Interior
to transfer normally public domain lands from the general cate­
gory where their entering sale is allowed over to a special
category where they are administered for special purposes.

But

I don’t believe that a reservation mefcamorphosizes a claim of
right based on the paramount rights doctrine into a claim of
right of come other nature to -- in the style of Gertrude
Stein — a reservation is a reservation is a reservation, but
not a claim of right.

-And that is the basic point I am making

as far as this particular area.

There was a reservation here

in 1949, r,- but for the 1947 decision the federal Government
had no claim that it had a right to own or to control the
submerged lands in the one-mile belt.

Without the submerged

lands, they had no right to control the supra-adjacent waters,
because the Antiquities «cfc does not allow addition of waters
in and of themselves.

It says expressly it must be lands that

are added, and then if we have any implied rights those rights
are to water

38
Vinat the Federal Government does is turn that on its
head and says, "Well* we reserved the waters and therefore we
ought to get the submerged lands."
QUE&TIGN:

But you put a great big "but for" in tiifcre

and it is the absence of that "but for" upon which the
Government relies* i.e., the 1947 decision in the first
California case.
MR* IUNGu-RXCK:

But the benafce report expressly states

■with regard to the claim of right exception that there is not
a good claim of right when that claim of right rests solely
upon the doctrine of paramount rights.
And I submit we don't look to the reservation,

he

look to the way in which the Federal Government owned or
controlled that land*

the reason why it owned or controlled

that land as being the claim of right.

That's my basic point

aid the basic point of difference with the United States,
he submit that if you look at the language of the Antiquities
Act* and the reason why the Government owned or controlled

it. that reason is the paramount rights doctrine of the '47
California decision.

In light of that*, the requirement has

tc be that it is not a good claim of right because it rests
solely •--QUESTION:

I'll repeat.

The Government's claim of

right doesn't r? It rests only derivatively on the paramount
rights* because it rests directly on President Truman's

39
proclamation
MR, IUNGE RICH:

I don't see a proclamation as being

a claim of right in any sense*
QUESTION:

You say a proclamation is basically a

reservation of land that the Government already owns, trans­
ferring it out of one category into a national monument*
MR* IUNGE RICH:
QUESTION:

The proclamation says --

That's the extent of their authority under

the Antiquities Act, too, isn't it?
MRo IUNGERICH:

In the statement of President Truman,

he says he does"proclaim the areas within one nautical mile
are withdrawn from all forms of appropriation and are reserved
as part of the Channel Islands National Monument,"
Now, the proclamation- in and of itself, doesn't do
anything.

It just reserves those lands, and it takes them out

of the area where they can be appropriated under public land
laws and it puts them into the national monument category*
It is not a claim of right in and of itself.

What we are

talking about is a claim of right where the Federal Government
has some claim that it owns or controls this land.
a claim that it owns or controls the land.

This isn't

This is merely a

statement that it is transferring it from one category to
another,

I think that is a critical point,
QUESTION:

argument:

Would this be a fair statement of your

V e should read the original decision and the statute

40
a-:.- saying,

in effect, that any claim of right shall be decided

as though the California case had been decided the other way?
MR. IUNGSRICH:

Yes,

I think that would be a fair

statement, because that's what the legislative history, the
'senate report, says, that we, in effect, are not allowing the
claim of right based solely on the paramount rights doctrine.
The 1953 Act.
QUraTlON:

The Submerged Lands Act,

MR. IUNGERICH:

Yes.

The claim of right language

that is contained within Section 5 of that Act.
QUESTION:

If it had been decided the other way,

then President Truman would not have had the power in 1949 to
make any reservations.
MR. XUNGERICH:

Thatf s correct.

And I would submit as wall,

in analyzing the legis­

lative history of the proclamation, that the essence of what
was intended by the actual occupancy under claim of right
exception was the situation where the Federal Government had
a claim in Litigation or a claim that may have been brought in
litigation,

and if that language had not been placed in

Section 5, all of those claims, either good or bad, would have
passed to California.
QUESTION:

Why, then, did California stipulate that

this land met the actually occupied clause?
MR. IUNGERICH:

he answer why it met the actually

occupied, because we don't think they've got a good claim of
right,.

And, therefore, the two parts of the language -~
QUAoTION:

You give away one ---

MR, lUNGiSRXCH:

We give away one part, but we don't

give away the claim of right part.
QUESTION:

Why don't you hold onto both parts of

your case and litigate?
MR. XUNGKRICH:

Because that would involve an ex ten-

sive factual issue, and I think probably that the Federal
Government would have prevailed on that issue and that was
a tactical j udgmenfc.
In conclusion, California submits that, first, with
regard to the interpretation of the proclamation, we have a
concession on the part of the Federal Government that both the
language of the proclamation does not cover the t id elands and
that, under those circumstances, California submits that it is
entitled to an affirmative decree such as it proposes, recog­
nizing its eights in those tidelands, and not really excluding
the t id elands, as the Federal Government does, from its decree.
We also submit that the interpretation of the :
IS'49 proclamation should be such that it should indicate that
the submerged lands had been placed in Executive Order 9633 in
IS45s and therefore, since there is an ambiguity as to what was
actually placed in 1949 in the Channel Islands National
Monument by the enlargement, without a repeal by implication of

42

the '45 proclamation- as a matter of law-, and by established
canons of statutory construction applied in this case to a
proclamation, there should be a determination, as a matter of
law, that, tain proclamation is interpreted as not including
submerged lands.

If it doesn't include submerged lands, our

argument is that waters alone could not have been added, just
the waters above the submerged lands, because the Antiquities
Act only permits the addition of lands owned or controlled by
the Government of the United States.

And it doesn't allow the

reservation of water, per se, without lands beneath them, or
without lands adjacent to them having been placed within the
ns t i on a 1 rn onumen t.
We further submit that as to the claim of right
exception the basic point here again, and X emphasize that is
that we look to the claim of right as being the underlying
claim that the Federal Government has that it owned or •controlled
those lands in 19^-5•

And, again, we submit that the claim of

right is not a reservation in and of itself, because a proclama­
tion such as this works no magic.

It doesn't improve the qual­

ity of the Federal Government's title.

It doesn't make the

Fed era 1 Government own something that it does not own. and it
does not take a reservation that was based solely on the fact
that the Federal Government adjudicated in 19*1-9 to own in one
sense or control in another sense the submerged lands of the
one-mile belt, and work a metamorphosis of that claim .into

^3
something that is separate and apart from the paramount rights
d oc trine,
And I think that's the fundamental pointy at least
as far as our case.

On either of these two points, I think

that the decree proposed by California should be adopted by
this Court and that judgment should be in favor of the State
of California with respect to this decree.
Ml, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Ryan.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A . RYAN, JR,, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE
MR, RYAN:

petitioner

California argues, as to the first stage

of this dispute, that the whole thing is really a problem with
sloppy draftsmanship, and that President Truman could have
accomplished everything that the United States says he did
accomplish had he only done it a little more carefully.
that, as I understand it, is a two-part argument.

And

He should

have said, according to California, rocks, waters, islets,
submerged lands, and so forth, instead of just saying areas.
Well, I grant you, had he said that, we perhaps
would not be in Court today.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, you would

They say that the

u~2 Submerged Lands Act would, nevertheless, run you out of

court.
MR. RYAN:

On that respect we would.

I am corrected.

The United States has contended that the Pwsfi-i

44
accomplished the same thing by the word "areas," and 1 don’t
see any need to go over that.
*

The second part of California's argument on this
point is that the 1945 executive Order, reserving the Outer
Continental Shelf, was not revoked by implication in the 1949
proclamation, as it should have been.

I think the answer to

that is to consider that the Executive Order of 1945 does the
following, and I quote from the order, itself.

As to the

Outer Continental Shelf, it is, quote, "placed under the
jurisdiction and control of the Secretary of the Interior for
administrative purposes, pending the enactment of legislation
in regard thereto."
And there it stood from 1945 until 1949.

In 1949j

two square miles of that 400,000 square mile Outer Continental
Shelf, l/4,000th of 1$, is conveyed, if you will, or trans­
feree3 from the Secretary of the Interior back to the President.
It is taken out of that category in which it was as a result
of the '45 decree and it is given back to the President, who
tl:en proclaims it to be a national monument.
Now, to call this s revocation by implication, if
that's the nest, then that's what it is,

Regardless of what

one calls it, it is vary clear that the land went to the
Secretary of the Interior in 1945, as part of the Outer
Continental shelf, and two square miles of it came back four
years later.

There is no problem with that.

There is no

45
necessity for the 1949 proclamation to say, "VJe revoke
1/4 #OOOth of the 1945 proclamation."

That's looking for

things that shouldn't be there in the first place.

It is a

very simple matter that the land went to the Secretary of the
Interior in '4-5 and it was given back, transferee! back four
years later,
QUESTION:

And then three miles of it all went to the

,.tc te, including these two miles.
Mil. RYAN:

Not including these two miles.

These

were not part of the two miles that went to the State.
QUESTION:

Because of the claim of right.

MR. RYAN:

Because they were specifically excepted

in Section 5(a), by virtue of the claim of right, yes.
QUESTION:

Yes, because of the statutory language

excluding claim of right.
.MR, RYAN:

Yes.

that this is simply an

£ thought it was, that it was fcransfered from the Department
of the Interior to the President and then he made a national
monument of it.
MR. RYAN:

The second part.
