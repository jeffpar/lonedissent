MR.. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 76~761, Ba1lew v. Georgia.
Mr. Clutter, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL CLUTTER,, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF of tee petitioner
MR. CLUTTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would first of all like to apologise both on my own
behalf and on behalf of Mr. Smith for the lateness of the motion
which allowed me to argue this case.

Mr. Smith is involved in

another matter and it was only at the end of last week that it
became apparent that that might interfere with argument here.
I apologize again for the lateness of that and any inconvenience
that may have caused the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

It is no inconvenience

to the Court at all.
MR. CLUTTER;

Thank you, sir.

This case involves a conviction in the state court of
the State of Georgia of two counts of distributing obscene
material.

The two counts are both predicated upon the same

material and involves two exhibitions of the film "Behind the
\

Green Door" in the sane theatre on two different dates.
The petitioner was tried on these two different counts

4
before a five-parson jury pursuant to the authority of the
Georgia constitutional provision which we challenge here.
was convicted.

He

The judgment of conviction was affirmed in the

Georgia Court of Appeals in the opinion and judgment which we
challenge here.
There are three arguments on this petition for cer­
tiorari.

I think in all candor that only two of them are

susceptible to any elucidation on oral argument.

The third

question relates to the obscenity of the fliras involved in this
case.

We certainly do not abandon that argument or in any way

retreat from it, but I don’t think that it could really be ex­
pounded upon much in oral argument.

We submit that qustion on

the arguments submitted in the brief# emd I would not choose* to
present any oral argument on that unless the Court has any
specific questions.
The other two questions involved are the five-person
jury# the constitutionality of the five-person jury before whom
the petitioner was tried, and the constitutionality of the jury
instructions which allowed a conviction on the basis of not
only actual knowledge of the materials but constructive knowledge
of the matariaIs.
The five-person jury question was one which was
specifically reserved by this Court — five persons or less was
specifically reserved by this Court in Williams v. Florida,
which approved a six-person jury and said that did not violate

5
the Sixth Amendment right as applied to the states through the
Fourteenth# reserving the question of whether any lesser number
might so vie lata it.
As is argued in the brief# I think there is just one
point that needs emphasis in this case which differentiates it
from cases like Williams# and that is that v*e are dealing with
a determination of obscenity and we are concerned in this case
thus not only with whether a five-person jury is as equally
able to determine guilt or innocence as a six or as a twelveperson# but whether a five-person jury is equally as able to
delineate the applicable community standards in. their determin­
ation of obscenity.
I think that since the First Amendment arguments here
differentiate this case from those like Williams, those are not
the only values upon which this argument is predicated# but I
think they are a separate and distinct line of argument.
QUESTION:

Then you are suggesting that this claim

about less than twelve jury is focused just in First Amendment
cases# is that it?
MR. CLUTTER;

1 am suggesting alternative arguments

to support the petitioner's position, Your Honor# that even if
the Court were to fine! that five-person juries might be con­
stitutionally acceptable as a Sixth Amendment matter in cases
not involving the First Amendment, that it should find that
five-person juries are not constitutionally acceptable in First

6
Amendment cases involving a determination of community standards,
QUESTION:

Beceoj.se that is not an appropriate repre­

sentative of a cross-section of the community?
MR, CLUTTER:

That's correct, Your Honor, that posi­

tion is espoused, pursuant to this Court’s —
QUESTION:

Could you make that argument equally that

in effect 24 would be more constitutional, even though we have
never used 24"-member juries?
MR, CLUTTER:

I don’t know if more constitutional

would be the appropriate t^ord to describe that.
QUESTION:

I am not sure either.

MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

I think —

But you are saying that it is not consti­

tutional to use less than twelve in a First Amendment case?
MR. CLUTTER:

We are submitting the argument that it

is not constitutional to use less than twelve in a First Amend­
ment case.:’ In the event that the Court finds that argument
without merit, that the drop in the number from six to five; is
even more important and even more suspect in a First Amendment
case than it would foe in another case,
QUESTION:

Well, would this suggest, Mr. Clutter,

that bench trials would be inappropriate in a determination of
obscenity, a single judge cannot?
MR. CLUTTER:

Your Honor, should a defendant invoke

his right to a jury trial, we would most surely submit —

?
QUESTION:

What if he didn’t?

MR. CLUTTER:

If he didn' t, he certainly has the right

to submit a determination of his guilt or innocence to a single
judge.
QUESTION:

Well, don't you have bench trials in

Georgia that determine obscenity, not in a criminal case but in
some kind of civil cases?
MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What about that, wen*Id a single judge be

able to determine an obscenity case?
MR. CLUTTER:

Yes, sir, pm*suant to the civil statutes

present in Georgia, a single judge —
QUESTION:

But you don't think that would present any

First Amendment problem?
MR. CLUTTER:

I think it does, Your Honor, but I have

to admit again that —
QUESTION:

Well, that is because of the waiver of the

co nstitut ion a 1 :c ight.
QUESTION:

I am talking about a civil case.

MR. CLUTTER:

In civil proceedings, even without a

waiver, I believe, although I can't state with certainty, that
it is possible to over a civil defendant's objection to try an
obscenity case before a judge and not before a jury.
QUESTION:

I thought we had had cases from Georgia

precisely of that kind, a judge trial and determination of

obscenity for purposes other than criminal.
MR. CLUTTER :

Your Honor, the only case I know of in

that regard that was here is Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton.

In

that particular case, which Robert Smith did argue before the
Court, I believe the defendant waived his right to a jury trial.
I am not sure, 1 am not positive of that, and I don't wish to
state that as a fact, but I believe that in that case it was
in the nature of what we would call a test case.

He wanted to

determine the constitutionality of —
QUESTION:

Well, a nuisance case in almost any state,

a nuisance case addressed to an equity court would very likely
be a single judge enjoining the display of film or book, would
it not?
MR. CLUTTER;

Most probably, Your Honor.

J. know of

no nuisance statute that is still extant that is held constitu­
tional.

The nuisance statute we [nave in Georgia as applied to

obscenity has been held unconstitutional by the Georgia Supreme
Court, and I think that nuisance statutes as applied to First
Amendment materials have met a similar fate in all the other
states fcliat I know of.

I don't know of any that remains.

I

know they have been struck down in Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana,
Illinois, Colorado, California, Nebraska, perhaps other states.
I don't know again whether juries were available in those other
jurisdictions.

All I know is that under Georgia's perhaps a

single judge could determine it, even over a defendant's

9
objection,, but that statute is no longer in existence,
QUESTION'S

Of course, there is at least one dissent

in this Court, Kingsley Books, back in *56 or 557, that was a
civil case —
MR. CLUTTERs
QUESTION:

Yes.

•— where it was suggested that the deter­

mination of obscenity ought always to be, bench trial or other­
wise , by a jury —
MR. CLUTTERS
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- because of its ftmction in a cross-

section of the community.

As far as I know, that idea has not

caught on.
MR. CLUTTER?

Your Honor, I think that argument has

taken on more significance post-Miller with the determination by
this Court that it is not a national community standards but
perhaps one person could as easily guess at as a group of six
or even twelve from a local community, when that standard has
been replaced by a standard of the local community, especially
with this Court's ruling that no evidence or. those community
standards need be submitted to the jury, to bring that into the
jury room with them, they live in the community and they bring
their own knowledge of community standards to the room with
them.

With that standard being applicable as opposed to some

national standard which they might only hear evidence on and
guess ou, I think that group deliberations are even more

10
important, even more constitutionally mandated»
QUESTION;

Wasn't your argument made and rejected in

McKinney v„ Alabama by a majority, where we are dealing with a
civil nuisance statute?
MR. CLUTTER;
addressed in McKinney.

I don5t believe that question was
I think McKinney dealt only with the

applicability of a civil determination to another litigant.
QUESTION?

Well, you may be right.

MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

And ~~

Well, I think Brother Relinquish was right

because at least ---- I have forgotten whether it was concurrence
or dissent.

It addressed it, but it was not raised.

MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

It was not decided by the Court,

ME, CLUTTER:

As far as I know, McKinney dealt only

with the applicability of determination of obscenity of a
criminal litigant later in foreclosing that question tc him in
a later sriminal obscenity case.
In the Court's enunciation in Williams, it did not
make any — it did not focus upon or decide the case on the
basis of historical analysis, but instead examined the purposes
of the right to trial by jury.

And as submitted in the brief,

I believe, in light of those purposes, both as to the determin­
ation of guilt or innocence of this defendant and as to the
determination of the. community standards in a First Amendment

11
area that the decrease from six to five or indeed from twelve
to five, since this is the first time the First Amendment issue
has aver been presented, is constitutionally suspect *

If the

right to a trial by jury is, as is said in Williams, safeguard
against an overzealous or corrupt prosecutor and it separates
the defendant from a compliant, biased or eccentric judge, 1
think that those values are little served if the compliant or
corrupt, biased or eccentric judge is only replaced by such a
jury.

And I think that the slipper slope argument, which is

recognized in Footnote 22, is squarely presented here, and I
just ask Your Honors to hold that time lias been reached to get
off the slippery slope, as the Court suggested that it would do
at the appropriate time in that footnote.
QUESTION:

Are you asking that Williams v. Florida be

overruled?
MR. CLUTTSRs

No, sir, I don't, think it is necessary

to overrule Williams v. Florida.

I think that there are two

alternative grounds for this particular question, either to
hold that Williams is inapplicable as applied to First Amendment cases, where pursuant to Miller a jury determination -excuse me, a determination of community standards must be made,
I think that even with Williams extant, the Court might merely
hold that the further step down the slope that was recognized
in that case in “65 is inappropriate but it certainly is not
necessary in either instance under either argument submitted by

12

this petitioner to overrule Williams.
The other question presented relates to the constitu­
tionally accepted minimum standard of scienter in obscenity
cases.

This question arises because the judge instructed the

jury in this case, pursuant to Georgia statute, that the de­
fendant could only be convicted far knowing distribution of
obscene material, that knowing in this content — and these are
the words of the statute — includes both a at. mil and construc­
tive knowledge, and a person has constructive knowledge if he
has knowledge or facts or circumstances that would put a reason­
able and prudent man on notice as to the suspect nature of the
material.
QUESTION:

Wasn't the charge constructive knowledge

of obscene content?
MR, CLUTTER:

Yes.

Again, that is from the wording

of the statute, is what it says.

The scienter requirement in

Georgia under the statute is worded as either actual or con­
structive» knowledge of the obsceno content.
QUESTION:

Well, 1 thought it was of a suspect con­

tent .
MR, CLUTTER:

Well, Your Honor, under the wording of

the statute •— and it is set forth in the appendix, it is stated
that constructive knowledge is knowledge of facts or circum­
stances — I3m sorry, Your Honor, it is not in the appendix,
but the wording of it —

13

QUESTION:

Well, I thought it quite important that

the charge was that the constructive knowledge was to be of a
suspect quality, not of the obscene quality.
MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

That is quite a difference —■

MR, CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor

Yes, it is

-■» and you made an argument based upon

that,
MR. CLUTTER:

Yes, sir, but both the constructive

knowledge of the obscene content and of the suspect nature of
the material is set forth in words in the statute, but what the
statute says is that one must have knowledge of the obscene
content of the material as a term of art —
QUESTION:

Were those the instructions to the jury?

MR. CLUTTER:

The instructions to the jury were that

that element could he met.
QUESTION:

Which element, of a suspect nature?

•MR. CLUTTER:

No, Your Honor, the element of knowledge

of the obscene content of the natsrial.
QUESTION:

Where are the instructions here?

MR. CLUTTER:

Your Honor, it is at the bottom of page

11, that the word "knowing' as useel in the statute is actual
or constructive knowledge of the obscene content —
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. CLUTTER:

but that element could be met merely

14
by showing knowledge or facts or circumstances that would put a
reasonable person on notice as to the suspect nature of the
material.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. CLUTTER:

So that it is applied both to the

actual and the constructive knowledge standard.
QUESTION:

I got lost.

You are reading from page 11

of what?
MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

The brief of the petitioner, Your Honor,

Thank you.

MR. CLUTTER:

The bottom of page 11 and the beginning

of 12, the beginning of the argument section of the brief.

I

would, like to —*
QUESTION:

So the instruction was, wasn't it, that he

was charged with constructive knowledge that the material is
obscene if there was enough information to put a reasonable
and prudent man on notice that the mater Lai was simply suspect?
MR. CLUTTER:

That's correct, Your Honor, they were

allowed to convict him on that basis and, again, that is the
wording of the statute.
QUESTION:

You don't se.-am in your brief or so far in

your oral argument to make much of -- unless I misunderstood
you — of the word "suspect.“
MR. CLUTTER:

Your Honor, I think, in light of this

Court's decision in Hamling, I think that all that the Georgia

15
statute means In that is that the defendant need not have
knowledge of the legal status of the material as obscene, and
we don8 t submit that he need —
QUESTION;

Or even constructive knowledge that it is

obscene, only constructive knowledge that it is suspect ™
MR., CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-- which is quite a different word frm

obscene, it means quite a different thing,, doesn’t it?
MR. CLUTTER:

Yes, sir.

All I wish to state, and.

the reason that particular element was not stressed in the
brief is that the petitioner does not here contend that he must
constitutionally be found to have had knowledge of the legal
status of the material as obscene, and that ignorance of the
law or failure to brush up on the law of obscenity would not
protect him, that he must merely have found to have knowledge
of the content of the material, and that falls within the
classification that it might be obscene.
But what the petitioner asserts in this case is that
he must have actual knowledge of those materials, not merely
that he finds himself in a circumstance where a jury might
conclude that someone else should have taken further inquiry.
QUESTION:

Do you. think there is any further differ­

ence in the standard to be applied for constitutional purposes
to a book store proprietor as opposed to a movie house owner?
MR. CLUTTER:

Your Honor, yes, in the sense that the

16

basic thrust of this argument is one of the chilling effects.
I think that the chilling effect in the distribution of bocks
would foe even greater, because of the longer time required for
a cautious bookseller to familiarise himself with his material
than for a cautious movie purveyor to sell movies.

However, I

am not aware of the factual circumstances under which movies
are distributed.
QUESTION:

Well, I would think typically a book store

might well have several thousand titles in it at any given time,
whereas —
.MR. CLUTTER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

-— a movie theatre presumably shows one or

two shows per night, doesn’t it?
MR. CLUTTER:

Some movie theatres, I guess with the

possibility of double-features and the multiple theatres that
I assume are present here may have six to twelve movies at any
given time.

But the chilling effect argument as put forth foy

this petitioner would relate net zo his exhibition of the film
but his original selection of it.

If a man is sitting in

Atlanta .and is trying to decide whether or not to order .a film
to show .in his theatre, a film with a title such as "Carnal
Knowledge,* which Your Honors are aware of because of Jenkins
v. Georgia, he might well under this statute not oven order
that film unless he has a chance to see it, and he might not
have a chance to see it before he orders it.

And if under this

17
statute he is worried that the mere presence of that title
would suscept him to — would make him susceptible to criminal
prosecutionf then he might well refrain from ordering that film
and exhibiting it in his community and thus deprive these
members of his community of a chance to see that film merely
because that title might later be held by a jury to have put
him where he were a reasonable and prudent man on notice as to
some suspect, nature of the material, so that it may occur even
before hs orders the material,
QUESTIONS

I notice in your brief that you describe

this film as a nationally acclaimed movie.

That suggests an

awareness by somebody of what the movie was all about or would
the answer to that foe that you d idn51 take a look at the movie
until after the case was brought? ■■-v.
MR. CLUTTER:

There is no evidence in this record, of

when he took account of it.,

If we were to go outside the

record, I could submit, as a. member of the court, he did in
fact not lock at it, but I don't think that is important to
this decision.

It was nationally acclaimed in the same way

that "Carnal Knowledge" was nationally acclaimed, but any in­
dividua! defendant may not have seen that material or been
made aware of circumstances that might later foe held to put him
on notice -QUESTIONs

He was first relying on hearsay —

MR. CLUTTER:

He was relying on hearsay as to the

18
general course of the film* he certainly wasn't --- and 13m not
even sure hew specific that hearsay was.

The national acclaim

of this film certainly didn't arise until after it had been
exhibited for sometime , and whether that was present at the
time he ordered the film or not, I am not sure.

But even if it

were, it was not specific enough, 1 would submit, to satisfy
the constitutional minimum standards of scienter, evan ware he
aware of that hearsay.
QUESTION:

Is it a fact that this petitioner had been

arrested a couple of times for shewing this film?
MR. CLUTTER:

Yes.

This conviction -- excuse me

this case involves two different counts of distributing the
film.

The first was on November 9, 1973, and the second was on

November 27, 1973.

Those were a couple of weeks apart.

The

film after his first arrest was continued to be shown and he
was in the theatre and under the prosecution's theory was the
manager of the theatre during that period of time encompassing
both of those dates.
QUESTION:

Which one of those arrests is before us

today?
MR. CLUTTER:

Both of them, Your Honor,

combined for a joint trial.

They ware

He was arrested., he was sentenced

to one year under each count, but those sentences were to run
concurrently.

He was fined, however, $1,000 on each count, so

that we have a punishment attaching to each count separately as

19
it relates to the fines, not as it relates to the tine to ba
served, however»
The prosecutor has submitted in his brief that this
question has already beer- answered by this Court - ani I think I
would just like to state briefly why I think it has not.
main reliance is upon Mishkin

His

v. Hew York and Ginsberg v. New

York, that involve two different New York obscenity statutes.
Tie first, of those was Mishkin

v. New York, and in­

volved the question by the petitioner very similar to the
question presented here, asks this Court to delineate the con­
stitutional acceptable minimum standard of scienter because
the wording of the statute there, which was section 1411 of the
New York statute, was fairly similar and authorising conviction
on the basis of constructive knowledge.
Howver , before that issue was addressed by this
Court, the New York Court of Appeals decided, People v.
Finkelstein, which is cited in this Court's opinion in Michigan,
and People v. Finkelstein decided that limited the scienter
requirement to what this Court described as a very stringent
element of scienter and required knowledge on those who are
accused, only those who are in some manner aware of the
character, not should be aware, not aware of facts or circum­
stances to put them on notice, but were aware of the content,
the character of the material are subject to prosecution, and

20

it is aimed thus not at innocent, even! stupidly innocent, but
calculated purveyance of filth.
With that limitation upon the statute, upon section
1411 of the New York Penal Codes, this Court die! not reach, and
it specifically says at page 511 of its opinion that it doesn’t
have to reach the constitutional minimum, that this statute as
limited, in this way to those who have knowledge is clearly
constitutionally acceptable.
That same result was reached in Ginsberg v. New York
a couple of years later, that involved section 484 of the New
York Penal Code.
Mishkin

The only difference from that, and the original

case was 484 dealt with distribution of material which,

although not obscene when judged against standard, of adults,
was obscene when judged against a standard of its appeal to
children.

It was specifically addressed to what today might be

called child porn or material which might appeal to children.
That had a scienter requirement again very similar to that
before this Court, and that was that knowingly means knowledge
or reason to know, belief or ground for belief.
I would admit that that is very similar to the stand­
ard here,

Again, that question was not reached in Ginsberg

because, again, People v. Finkelstein glossed on the statute,
was held by this Court to require that under that gloss that,
actual knowledge, those who are in some manner aware of the;
character of the material are subject to prosecution.

With that

21
gloss, this again, the Court again states at page 644 and 645
of its opinion, it is not necessary to decide whether or not a
constructive knowledge requirement is sufficient because in
this case there was an actual knowledge requirement.

Now,

neither of those eases reach that issue.
The only other case cited by the Solicitor in support
of his position in this regard is Rosen v. United States, a
19th Century prosecution under the federal statutes, in which
the Court said the issue was — the inquiry was whether a paper
which was mailed was obscene, lewd and lascivious, and whether
it was deposited in the mails by one who knew or had notice of
its content.
X think, however, taken in context, if you read on
from the quotation in the case which is cited by the Solicitor,
the following phrase is thus someone can be convicted even
though he did not regard it as forbidden.

I think all this

really is in Rosen is a statement that was repeated by this
Court in Ham ling, that one need not be aware of the legal status
of material as obscene.

And X just wish to repeat that the

petitioner hare does not put forth that position and does not
suggest that that position is even necessary to support him in
this case.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Clutter, do I understand you to take

the position that if the defendant can honestly testify that he
never saw the movie, has avoided seeing it, that he will always

22
have that defense?
MR. CLUTTER:
two things;

No, sir.

As stated in hare, we admit

First, the state certainly has the right to prove

knowledge on tha basis of circumstantial evidence? and, as this
Court said in Smith, that the judicial process and its ability
to ascertain truth is not foreclosed by someone’s denial, that
it may well be that a jury could find that a defendant knew
the contents of a film, whether he saw it or not.

All we submit

is that that knowledge has to be actual, .rather than construc­
tive knowledge.

I think that people know a great many things

without seeing them, and may know the content of material —•
someone who purposely, for instance, purposely refusas to view
films before showing them could wall be held by a jury to say
that the reason he refused to look at then was indeed exactly
because he knew what was in them.

And all we are arguing in

this case is that, although that may be sufficient —
QUESTION;

One other question, Mr. Clutter.

explained why Michigan and Kami lag are not important.

You have
What is

the strongest case supporting your position on this matter,
this issue?
MR. CLUTTER;

Your Honor, as it relates to construc­

tive knowledge, I know of none that specifically address the
question.

I think that the wording of Hamling as it goes

toward knowledge I think supports the position of petitioner.
But most strongly I think is Smith v. California.

The reasoning

23
of Smith is equally applicable to this case, although admitted­
ly to a less degree»

The chilling effect may not be as strong

if someone has no say in the requirement and can’t distribute
any material unless he actually reads it.

What we have here is

a chilling effect that results in suppression of material which
even in the slightest way may allude to sex and thus scare off
the cautious bookseller, the cautious film purveyor, until he
actually has personei! knowledge of the film or the book he dis­
tributes.
Tfcank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Fir. Rhodes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD W. RHODES, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RHODES;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
My colleague has already expounded on the questions
involved.

I will go right into the five-person jury question.

And under Georgia law, as authoritatively construed in numerous
cases, it has been held that all juries must return a unanimous
verdict, whether that'be a civil case or a criminal case, and
irrespective of the size of the jury.

This means that in the

case at bar, the jury was in fact charged that they must return
a unanimous verdict and that they must find all of the elements
of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, so that this means that
this jury found that Mr. Ballew in this particular case

24

participated' in the exhibition of this motion picture, that the
film was in fact obscene, that he knew it was obscena or was
aware of facts which would put a reasonable and prudent person
on notice as to the suspect nature of the film, which under the
Georgia lav; constitutes notice, and that he intended to commit
the crimes on both occasions.
New, how many jurors are necessary to afford a fair
trial.

As has already been discussed, the case of Williams v.

Florida, six: was held to be sufficient in a case, a felony case,
where the accused was charged with the offense of robbery, was
tried for the offense of robbery and was sentenced to life
imprisonment.
In the case at bar, the maximum imprisonment is twelve
months for each count, a misdemeanor offense.
QUESTION s

What was the sentence?

MR. RHODESs

Twelve months on each count.

Now, in Footnote 28 of the majority opinion in the
Williams case, it was written “wa have no occasion i:i this case
to determine whit minimum number

3an

still constitute a jury,

but we do not doubt that six is above that minimum.n

Now, it

follows that if six is above the minimum, five just cannot be
below the minimum.

There is no number in between.

QUESTION:

The question should have been decided then.

You say this question was decided right then and there?
MR. RHODES:

If we apply the Williams case co all

25

criminal cases, yes, sir»
QUESTION;

But the Court later said the question was

open, didn't it?
MR. RHODES;
Honor.

Well, I am not familiar with that, Your

That may very well be.
In Georgia, the Constitution or the Constitution of

the State of Georgia provides that not less than five jurors
may foe used to try misdemeanor cases.

The Criminal Code of

Fulton County, which has since been changed to the State Court
of Fulton County, and in the court in which this defendant was
tried, by statute, statute permitted by the Georgia Constitution
allowed misdemeanor cases to be tried by five-person juries.
That has sine® been changed.

It was changeel before this case

was on appeal, but it has been changed and now the minimum in
that court -- and I know of no other court in Georgici which has
fewer than six

the same court —

QUESTION:
trial today then

Well .7 if this petitioner were brought to

in Georgia, how many people would foe on the

jury?
MR. RHODES;

In this court would be six.

hs a matter

of fact, he -was brought to trial this year in another case and
he had six parsons on the jury.
In the case of Johnson v. Louisiana, 1972, the Court
there approved the legal maximum that the burden of proof by
state

that the state can require a burden of proof by more

26
jurors in a more serious case.

In other words, the lesser the

seriousness of the offense or the lass serious punishment by a
smaller jury and the more severe oases by a larger jury, and
that system, which the Court apparently approved, provided for
a unanimous verdict in juries of five where less serious crimes
were involved, by nine of twelve 'where more serious crimes and
more severe punishment was involved, and the unanimous verdict
of twelve in the most severe cases.
There has been considerable studies made in recent
years on jury size and rule of decision, and I would be the
first to admit that they fall on both sides of the fence.
There will be a list of numerous studies which will
be published this month, and I have been notified by authors
Tar.ke & Tanke, a husband and wife team out in San Francisco,
Mr. Tank® being a lawyer and his wife being a psychologist, that
they have formulated an annotated list of some of these studies.
It would bs printed by the American Psychological Association.
QUESTIONS

Do you. think we should withhold our de­

cision until that comes out?
MR. RHODES*

Ho, Your Honor.

out that I would note heres

There are sane already

The Journal of Personality and

Social Psychology, in 1975, Volume 32, pages 1 through 14, a
study of six and twelve-person juries, involving unanimous and
two-third majority rules, reported that neither size nor rule
decision affected the decision distribution.

27
In the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform,
1973, a report that minority jurors in

six-member j aries par­

ticipated more in the jury deliberations than did minority
jurors in twelve-member juries.

The same publication in a

before and after study of a change from twelve to six-member
juries, reported that there were substantial similarity in the
results of the verdicts.
In a publication

Jury Verdicts, "The Role of Group

Sice and Social Decision," by Michael J. Sachs, of Boston
College, copyrighted this year, having been assigned the
Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 76-44569, Mr. Sachs re­
ported that there were no significant differences occurring in
the conviction/acquittal ratio or the proportion of hung juries
as a function of jury size? but he did report that

smaller

juries will lead to a decrease in the number of convictions, or
at least his studies and report made a suggestion that the
smaller juries would lead to a decrease in the number of con­
victions .
QUESTION:

This is all psychology.

MR. RHODES:
QUESTION:

And, as I say, they —

And it has w'lat bearing on us?

Mil. RHODES:
Justice Marshall.

Right.

Well, empirical data, Your Honor, Mr*

I am simply citing — I know that there are

others on the other side of the fence, but these appear to bear
out my contention that a five-member jury is sufficient.

28
I call the Court's attention to the case of Sanders
v. Georgia, which this Court denied Servian on the identical
question one year before the question was — cert was granted
on the question in this case.

That was reported at 424, US 393.

Sanders was tried in the same court, a five-person jury,
appealed and cert was denied.
On the question of scienter, as has already been
stated, the Georgia law requires that in obscenity cases the
defendant have knowledge of the obscene nature.

The law further

provides that knowledge can be actual or constructive, and that
constructive knowledge is either knowledge of facts which would
put a reasonable and prudent person on notice of a suspect
nature of the material.
QUESTION?
it?

Well, that removes it one step, doesn't

This jury was instructed under the statute, as I under­

stand it, correctly constructed as far as the statute went that
a person has knowledge of the obscene content of the material
if he has constructive knowledge of the suspect nature of the
material.

That is two big steps, isn't it?
MR. RHODESs
QUESTION s

The statute provides —
Not if he has constructive knowledge of

the obscene nature of the material, if ha has — he was in­
structed that, he knows what the material is if he has reason to
know that it is suspect, not that ha has to reason to know what
it is.

29

MR. RHODES?

Well, the Georgia law provides what was

charged.
QUESTION :

I know that , and so the —

MR. RHODES?
QUESTION:

If he is aware —
The instructions were in accord with the

Georgia statute —
MR. RHODES:
QUESTION;

That's correct.
— but the question, of courses, is whether

or not that is a sufficient instruction in view of the First
Amendment, isn't it?
MR. RHODES:

That's the question, yes.

The petitioner

concedes that knowledge, while being required to be actual, can
be proved by circumstantial evidence.
QUESTION:

Nov?, we submit *—

But this jury is instructed that he knew

it was obscene if he had constructive knowledge, not that it
was obscene, but that it was suspect.
MR. RHODES:

Well, I fail to see a great deal of dif­

ference —
QUESTION:

The two certainly have quite different

meanings, those two words, don't they, even in this context?
MR. RHODES:

Well, our position is that if he is

aware of facts which would put him on notice of the suspect
nature of the material.

In this instance, on both occasions he

was aware that he was working in an adult theatre, he was the
manager, the film was advertised as being a triple-X movie,

30
signs not allowing anyone under the age of 18 or 21, I don* t
recall the exact age factor — we contend that those are facts
or circumstantial evidence which in effect warrant the infer­
ence that he knew that it was obscene and that —
QUESTIONs

No

but the jury’s instructions was that

it could and should find him guilty if he had reason to know it
was suspect, and if it is something suspect, it may or may not
be obscene.

The jury was instructed that they were to find

that he knew it was obscene if he had simply reason to know
that it was suspect.

QUESTION s
MR. RHODES:
QUESTION:

of a suspect nature? the material.
Yes.
That's correct.
Mr, Rhodes, suppose he knew that the narae

of the film were "Carnal Knowledge,” that would satisfy the
intent requirement under the statute, even though the film in
fact is not obscene, wouldn't it?
MR. RHODES;
QUESTION:

Not —'
Because that would put him on notice that

it was suspect.
MR. RHODES:
QUESTION:

Not today, I don't think it would.
Well, before this Court.8s decision in

holding that it was not obscene, he should by just knowing that
was the name of the film, that would put him on notice,
wouldn't it?

ME, RHODES;

MR. RHODES;
QUESTION;

I don't think so.
You don't think so —
I just —
Wouldn't that raise a suspicion,, wouldn't

that make a man suspicious that it might be obscene?
MR. RHODES ;

I think it would raise a suspicion, and

it should —
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t that exactly what the statute

requires, just exactly that?
MR. RHODES;
QUESTION;

Well —
It says knowledge of a fact, namely that

it is named "Carnal Knowledge," which would put a reasonable
prudent man on notice of a suspect nature material.
MR. RHODES;
QUESTION;

Well, I —
And under the statute and under the in­

structions then, the jury is told to convict him.
MR. RHODES;

Well, I would still contend and submit

that to prove that would also prove his knowledge of the
obscenity by circumstantial evidence.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rhodes, 2 notice that the Georgia

Court of Appeals, page A.S and A.6 of the petition devoted only
one paragraph to this claimed error in the instructions, and
at the top of page A.6 of the petition, it says one charge
complained of was a quotation of the definition of obscene
material as set forth in section 26-2101, which I think is the

32
one that petitioner refers to.
Is there any place other than in the record itself
where there wouId be available a. complete text of the trial
judge's charge?
MR. RHODES ;

It is here in the joint appendix, at

page -QUESTION:

In the joint appendix,, the full charge is

in the joint appendix?
MR. RHODES;
QUESTION:
MR. RHODES:

Faga A.7 of the joint appendix.
Thank you.,
Now, I would like just briefly to make a

comparison cf a number of the casas that Mr,. Clutter has already
mentioned.
In Rosen v. United States, notice of its contents,
notice of its contents was held sufficient.

In Smith v.

California, circumstances may warrant the inference that he was
aware cf what a book contained.

It was held that eyewitness

testimony that he had read the book was not necessary, but
circumstances which would warrant the inference that ha was
aware of what the book contained, despite his denial.
In Mishkin v. New York, it was held that in some
manner aware was sufficient, in some manner aware of the
character of the material.

In Ginsberg, reason to know, reason

to know, and we think that knowledge cf facts which would put a
reasonable and prudent person on notice of the suspect nature

33

would be the same as reason to know? or some manner aware.
QUESTIONS
MR. RHODES:

Reason to know what’?
Reason to know the nature of the mater-

ial.
QUESTIONS

Suspect, he is guilty if he has reason to

know that it is suspect, then under the instructions he is
guilty of knowing that it was obscene.

That hardly follows

just as a matter of rational inference, does it?
MR. RHODES:

Well, these cases I am citing, Mr.

Justice Stewart, make these statements, having notice or being
aware of the character of the material —
QUESTION:

Yes, but not being aware that the material

is suspect.
MR. RHODES:

Well, I fail to see a great deal of dif­

ference.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rhodes, does the same statute govern

both, apply to both, book stores and motion pictures?
MR. RHODES:

Yes, it does, Your Honor.

In the case of. California v. Kuhns, which cert was
denied by this Court, it is reported 61 California Appeals, 3d,
page 735, had a similar provision that is determined by the
appellate courts of California, be aware of the character of
the matter was the required.
In Hamling v. United States, it approved the reason­
ing in Mishkin and Ginsberg, and that was in some manner aware

34
or reason to know, reason to know.

Now, to me, reason to know

is still the same as having knowledge effects, it would put a
reasonable and prudent person on notice»
QUESTIONS

Well, one has to ask reason to know what?

Let’s assume, to take a ridiculous case, that your legislature
said that if you have reason to know that a book contains
paper and printing on it, then that is constructive knowledge
that it is obscene, and that clearly would be wholly irrational
and invalid law under the First Amendment.

MR. RHODES:
QUESTION:

Well -Now, they don’t say

and here they say

if you have reason to know it is suspect, then you know it is
obscene.

They don’t say if you have reason to know it is

obscene, then you know it is obscene,
MR. RHODES:

Well, I think here they are saying that

if he has reason to know it is obscene, if he has reason to
know
QUESTION:

The instructions dees not say that and the

statute does not say that,
MR. RHODES:

But in here,

in these cases, Ginsberg

and some of the others that I have cited., ho has reason to
know, and if he has reason to know that it is suspect, he has
some knowledge of it either way.
QUESTION:

Suspect, if he has reason to know it is

suspect, ha has constructive knowledge that it is suspect.

35
MR. RHODES:
QUESTION:
MR.. RHODES:

Well, if he has reason —
But these instructions didn't say that.
Well,. I might go one stop further and

say that he would be put on notice and he would be required
under the Georgia law, and I think under these other cases
where it says reason to know, would foe put on notice to look
further into the matter and to make an analysis of what ha is
doing to determine whether or not he should continue what he
is doing.
QUESTION:
subject.

May 1 ask one further question on this

Dc you think if Georgia had a law that said a man is

absolutely liable for distributing obscene material if it is
in fact obscene, regardless of whether he had. any knowledge
whatsoever about its contents, that would be consistent with
the First amendment?
MR. RHODES:
QUESTION:
MR. RHODES:

No, Your Honor.
You don't?
Mo.

I think he must of necessity be

aware in sera a manner of what ha is doing, he has to lave seme
intent to distribute or exhibit obscene material.
QUESTION:

I have one other question.

man jury point, are there other — how many other states have
five-person juries, of which you are aware, do you know?

MR. RHODES:

If I may in conclusion say that we ask

the Court to reaffirm that obscene material is not protected by
the First Amendment.

We ask that the Court view this film and

rule that it is obscene as has hssn so ruled on three occasions
in the trial court in this case, by the Appellate Court, the
Court of Appeals of Georgia, and by the Northern District
Court of Texas, and that you make it plain to those people in

How about the jury?

MR. CLUTTER;

And if the jury in fact was constitu­

tionally insufficientj, I thinke although it might be helpful in
a retrial of this matter to know whether the instructions

point for the Court to reach the question of what jury instruc­
