E^OCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in United States v. New York Telephone Company.
Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CHE PETITIONER
MR, WALLACE:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The issue in this case is the validity of an order

authorizing FBI agents to install and use pen registers, as
these devices are commonly called, on two designated telephones
and ordering the respondent telephone company tc furnish all
information, facilities and technical assistance needed to in­
stall the pen registers unobtrusively.
The order was based on a finding of probable cause
to believe that certain named individuals and others unknown
were conducting an illegal gambling enterprise in violation of
t

Federal law by the use of the two designated telephones at a
certain address specified in the order, and these findings
were based on an affidavit by an FEI agent shewing the reasons
for believing this information to be true.
4

The sufficiency of that affidavit and ef the orders
specificity and reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment are
not disputed here.

Indictments have since been returned with

respect to this investigation, and motions to suppress have
been denied.

It is in that proceeding that such issues would

be litigated.
Now, the order itself appears in the appendix at
pages 6 and 7, preceded by the affidavit, incidentally.

The

order has considerable particularity in Fourth Amendment terms,
and it contains a couple of provisions to which I want to draw
particular attention.
One is at page 7, at the conclusion of the first
paragraph, the order specifies that the telephone company is
to be compensated for at the prevailing rates for providing
the faciliti.es and technical assistance required, and the
other is in the next "wherefor11 clause, Fart E, the purpose of
the order is; specified here.

It is to ascertain by identify-

ing outgoing calls the numbers that are dialed in outgoing
calls, to identify associates and confederates of those who
prior investigation, including a prior authorized wife tap,
indicated were involved in this enterprise, and this is for
purposes in looking at the outgoing calls of ascertaining the
scope of the gambling conspiracy, where it is that bets may be
being laid off, as the expression is? when they may receive
more in the way of particular bets than they can. handle? . then
confederates, other gambling enterprises, will be called to
see if they can take a portion of the bet.
This is an investigative technique to indicate the
scope of the gambling conspiracy.
And that was the purpose of what was involved here.

5
Now,, the pen register devices themselves are famil­
iar to this Court.

They were involved in the esse of United

States v. Giordano and the District Court, there described in
some detail how they operate and what they do.

They disclose

only telephone numbers that are dialed from the telephone to
v/hich line the device is attached.

In the absence of some

further attachments to the pen register device which are not
authorized by this order, the pen register does not indicate
whether any conversation is occurring over the line let alone
hear any conversations, does not indicate whether it is a
result of dialing.

There is a ring, a busy signal at the

other end, how many rings, whether the telephone is answered:
None of that can be ascertained by the use of what was
authorized by this order.
So essentially the information that is received is
nothing different than what could be secured from telephone
company records to the extent that they are maintained.

Tele­

phone toll calls or message unit billing records, long­
distance calls — every telephone company has records that
can be secured without any showing of probable cause by grand
jury subpoena.
QUESTION:

There just are no records, however, are

there, of non-toll local calls made from an ordinary tele­
phone?
Ml. WALLACE:

There is no indication that there are

6

such records here.
Sorae local telephone companies do keep track of local
calls, do have records of them because of billing practices
based on message units.
QUESTION;

In limited •—

Well, that may show the number of calls,

but does it show the numbers called?
MRe WALLACE;

In some telephone companies it does,

that is my understanding.

There is nothing in this record

to indicate that one way or the other.
QUESTION:

My experience was, it v/as hot possible

to get those, in response to a subpoena.

7
MRo WALLACE;

Well, to the extent that they ax'e

available, they can be secured that way.

The telephone company

here says that they are not available •>-QUESTION;

And your argument is that this — as I

thought, the inference to be derived from your argument was
this would provide no more information than could have been
secured by subpoena, and that is not —
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

Well, if those records were there —

— your argument is not valid.

MR. WALLACE;

Well, that.* s right.

To the extent

those records are available, they can be secured by subpoena,
QUESTION;

Well, to the extent they are, that's the

whole critical 5iif" in your argument.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is correct, and the pen

register device is often used by the telephone company to as­
certain this kind of thing for billing purposes and to make
its - ,-m records when it has concerns relating tc toll billing,
but ■—
QUESTION;

-- internal use of the pen register for

its own purposes by the telephone company?
MR. WALLACE;

The record doesn't show it, but there

is showing of this in sources that we have cited in our brief
dealing with the use of pen registers.
QUESTION:

Do those sources show a widespread use, a

continuous use by the telephone company of pen registers for

their own internal purposes?
MR. WALLACE;

That is the principal use of pen

registers by the telephone company, rather than by law enforcement officials.
QUESTION;

This is New York City?

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Do you tell me that in New York City they

have pen registers on every phone in New York City?
MR® WALLACE:

Oh, not on every phone.

that the telephone company does use them.

It is just

I am sure that

counsel for the telephone company can shed more light on this.
There's nothing in the record on the extent to which they use
it.
QUESTION:

I mean, what is the percentage number?

MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION:

I have no idea.

It would be very small —

MR. WALLACE:

I would have no idea, Mr. Justice

Marshall„
QUESTION:

There are quite a few phones in New York

City.
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

It would be a spot

check situation, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggests, so far as I
am aware.
The purpose of my comparison is merely to point out
the very limited nature of the information that can be

9

3
ascertained through the use of these devices.

Many generali­

zations that are heard about the evils of electronic surveil­
lance are not responsive to the limited authorization, the
limited investigatory technique that is involved here, which
gives you nothing more than what you can get from the telephone
company with respect to long-distance calls.

Whatever the

situation is with respect to local calls, it's hard to see
why there’s a constitutional difference between local and long­
distance calls for these purposes.
And those records are not contested, would be avail­
able under this Court's decision that's.analogous to this in
X

United States v. Miller, with respect to bank records, and
more specifically, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals som**
years ago addressed this question in a case cited in our brief
called United States v. Gallo, G-a-l-l-o, a panel consisting
of the two judges, Hand and Judge Swann, who wrote the opinion,
holding that the evidence was competent taken from the tele­
phone company by subpoena showing calls between a phene in the
appellant's home and telephones registered in the names of
certain co-defendants who pleaded guilty.

It was of limited

probative value because it showed nothing but the existence
of such calls, but it was admissible, and the admission was
upheld, and the Court explained there that this was r.ot a
violation of Section 605 of the Communications Act, which at
that time'forbade the telephone company or anyone else from

10

4

disclosing the contents of wire communications*
The statute they held

and I wish I had known about

this in connection with United States v. Miller, I wish I had
known about this case — but the statute was not intended to
proscribe long-standing reasonable business practices of com­
munication companies.

When a person takes up a telephone, he

knows that the company will make or may make some kind of a
record of the event, and he must be deemed to consent to what­
ever record the business convenience of the company requires.
If by any stretch of the language of Section 605,
which no longer applies in this area, the making of such a
record could be termed an Interception of the communication,
it is one which the sender has authorized, hence it is not
within the ban of the statute.
QUESTION:

That should be cited in the brief.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

It is cited.

Oh, it is cited.

MR. WALLACE:

United States v, Gallo.

Well, I was

just reading from the opinion a pertinent portion which goes
to this question.
To the extent that what’s involved here could be
characterised as a communication at: all, it is a communication
to the telephone company requesting service, the dialing of the
number.

it’s not the kind of communication that either the

old Section 605 or current statutes have been concerned about.

11

Now, in response to the order, the telephone company
here did furnish all the information recmired to enable the
FBI to do the installation itself, identifying where the lines
could be found and that sort of thing, and if there had not
been compliance to that extent, the FBI would have been
physically unable to carry out the order.
QUESTIONS

Do you agree that the, that an official

pen register must have court consent and approval?
MR. WALLACES

Well, not necessarily court consent:

We think that it would require a warrant that can be issued by
a federal magistrate.
QUESTION:

So you don’t say that without any offi­

cial approval at all, the FBI could install a pen register?
You need a warrant?

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. WALLACE:

Here we did secure a warrant.

They

sent a finding of probable cause.
QUESTION:

I am not sure I follow that.

If these

were records which were available, which you assumed in your
colloquy with Justice Stewart, why couldn't the FBI just go
over and ask the telephone company to seo what they had?

12

MR. WALLACES

Well, my understanding is that these

records are not available in the New York Telephone Company.
QUESTION?

Well, to the extent that they axe avail­

Now, why couldn’t the FBI just go over and say, "What

have you got in the nature of pen register records, maybe just
long-distance calls, from this number?"
MR. WALLACE;

Is there anything —

They needed a warrant fee install the

pen register to ascertain the numbers that are being dialed
from these telephones.
QUESTION:
warrant?

Well, you say that, but what required the

What legal rule required them to get a warrant to

get additional numbers beyond those that are already recorded
by the telephone company?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, they showed a need in their

criminal investigation to get the numbers.
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand the practical reason why

they wanted them, but why couldn't they just do it independent­
ly?

Assume they had the technical know-how.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it could be argued that they

could.
QUESTION;

The Gallo case, it might follow that they

could.
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, it might follow, and it has been

argued in some c£ the literature that they could.

We think

that the implications of the Court of Appeals decisions on

1
13

this question and of the opinion agreed to by four members of
this Court in United States v. Giordano is that there is a
search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment involved
here, and in order to conduct the search, where there's time
to get a warrant, we ordinarily will get a warrant, make our
showing.
QUESTION:

You don't have to get into the point of

the right of the FBI to walk into a business establishment, and
tap a phone, do we?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

No.

Do we have to get to that point, to decide

this case?
MR. WALLACE:

We’re .not ••— not at all, we’re not in­

volved with a tap in this case, or what is commonly called a
tap.
QUESTION:

Physically how do you install that?

MR. WALLACE:

It's installed by — it’s installed to

the line, it’s a tap in that sense, but it’s not a tap that
enables you to listen to anything on the line.
QUESTION:

What I mean is, if you're going to in­

stall a pen register, say on my telephone, how is it. done?
MR. WALLACEs

Well, the ~way that it normally is done,

in order for it to be done unobtrusively, is by leasing a line
from the teleph<ne company which the telephone company can in­
dicate how that line car. be connected at a box where the two

14
lines emerge to the telephone that you want to attach the pen
register to, and then the leased line can be extended to a
location where the pen register can be attached to the leased
line.
Otherwise cables would have to ba attached to the
box in the apartment building or on the back of the building
where the telephone line makes what is called an appearance
in order to have a line to which the pen register could be
attached.

And as a matter of fact, that was the precise

problem here.
While the telephone corapciny was willing to pro-*
vide the information, it was not willing to lease the line
to the FBI which would enable the FBI to install the pen
register unobtrusively, without having to string cables.
Instead, the telephone company suggested to the
FBI that they should string their own cables from this
apartment building in order to install the pen register
and comply with the order, and after a four-day —
QUESTION:
cording device?

A pen register, I gather, i.s just a re­

Is that it?

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

15
QUESTION:

And does the FBI keep an inventory of pen

registers?
MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION;

They do have them? that is correct.

In this instance, would they want the

telephone company to provide the pen register from the tele­
phone corapany stock, or would they —
MR. WALLACE;

Not the pen register.

They would have

provided their own, or it would have been agreeable to them if
the telephone company had wanted to install its pen register
somewhere.
QUESTION;

Who manufactures them, the telephone com­

pany?
MR» WALLACE:

I don’t know the answer to that, but

the registers here were FBI property.
QUESTION:

How large a device is it, small?

MR. WALLACE:

There are pictures.

I don’t know

precisely.
But the point is that the FBI made a four-day sur­
veillance of the neighborhood, knowing that counter**
surveillance techniques were being used by this gambling en­
terprise which had a history, the record showsf of changes of
address and changes of telephone numbers quite frequently, and
they concluded that they could not execute the warrant un­
obtrusively without the leased lines that sending agents in to
string a line there would have resulted in cessation of the

IS

.0

gambling activities and frustration of the court's order.
So in the meantime.» the telephone company filed a
motion in the case seeking vacation of that part of the order
requiring them to provide facilitiesf and that order was
denied in all respects by the District Court, but granted by
the Court of Appeals in a fcwo-to-one decision, the majority
agreeing with the Court, of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in
a prior decision, and since then the Eighth Circuit has also
agreed with this, held that the District Court did have author­
ity to authorise the FBI to install the pen register, and it
assumed arguendo that it, that there was also authority,
either inherently or under the ill! Writs Act, to require the
telephone company to provide the assistance to enable that
order to be carried out, but it held that it would be an abuse
of discretion in the absence of specific legislative authority
on this subject to exercise that authority on the basis of
what might be called the first step down a slippery slope kind
o f ra tionale.
What is significant for our purposes in the opinion
can be found: in paragraphs on pages X3A and 14A of the appen­
dix to the petition, in.which the Court of Appeals specifies
that what it calls the most persuasive point argued by the
Government j.n support of the order is that without the appel­
lant’s technical aid, the order authorizing the use of the pan
register will be worthless 6

17
1
Federal law enforcement agents simply cannot imple­
ment pen register surveillance without the telephone company’s
help.

The assistance requested required no extraordinary ex­

penditure of time or effort by appellant; indeed, as we under­
stand it, providing lease or private lines is a relatively
simple routine procedure »- and I'll interject there that the
dissenting judge specified, this is on page 2G& of the appen­
dix, that the telephone company concedes that the assistance
required of it was not burdensome.

All that, was required was

the provision of certain plans and the flicking of a switch at
a central terminal»
QUESTION;

That is rather a sweeping concession which

the telephone company might not bo happy to rely on, that, they
can provide this technical assistance without fear of criminal
or civil liability.

Does the Court cite any authority for the

proposition?
MR. WALLACE;

The Court did.

The Court cited Section

2520 of Title 18, which is part of Title 3 of the Omnibus
Crime Control Act of 1968, and that provision specifies —
QUESTION s

Does that deal with civil liability?

MR. WALLACE:

It does, it deals with both civil and

criminal liability, and it specifies that a good faith reli­
ance on a court order or on legislative authorization shall
constitute a complete defense to any civil or criminal action
brought nud.sr this chapter or any other law.

18

.2

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit referred
to certain other legislation that would grant immunity from
liability.

Tha finding here was that because of Section 2520

the telephone company need have no fear of liability if it
acts pursuant to a court order, and of course the order pro­
vides for financial remuneration to the company.
So the —
QUESTION;

Mr» Wallace, has the Congress been in­

vited to legislate, do you know?
KE„ WALLACE;

13m not aware of any pending legisla­

tion, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
Now, the argument that respondent seeks to renew
here, although it did not petition, and we have agreed that
it's sufficiently closely connected with the rest of what else
is at issue that it should be considered by the Court, that
Title 3 governs this, seems to us to have been adequately ans­
wered in the concurring and dissenting opinion filed by four
Justices in Giordano, and I will have to leave that argument
to their opinion and to the brief, the legislative history is
very specific on. that point, that pen registers are not cover­
ed, and it was the content of the communication rather than the
fact of the communication that was to be protected.
What remains here are the question about the validity
of the order with respect to the authorisation itself, which
we think Rule 41 applies to, as it seemed to us the Court of

19
.3

Appeals assumed in Katz and Osborne with respect to seizure of
intangible electrical impulses of this sort, or since it's
sometimes referred to as an order in the nature of a search
v/arrant, one could instead resort to Rule 57B of the Criminal
Rules, which authorizes the District Court to proceed in any
manner not prohibited elsewhere.
Either way, the protections of the Fourth Amendment
are satisfied in this area, and the rule with some adaptation,
because it doesn't specify, it’s not drafted, in terms of a
durational search of the sort that's involved here, with some
adaptation —
QUESTION:

Bo we understand that Rule 57B is a grant

of jurisdiction?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we really are relying on Rule 41.

Rule 57B I think gives some authority to proceed in the nature
of Rule 41 when the terms of Rule 41 need to be varied some­
what, because of a different kind of —
QUESTION:

Let me ask the question again:

Do you or­

do you not contend that Rule 57 is an independent grant of
jurisdiction to a Federal court?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we haven’t made that contention.

I don’t want to concede that it is not, however.

We think

Rule 41 is satisfactory for our purposes here, and that the
issue then becomes whether, when, an order issued under Rule
11 cannot be carried out without the technical assistance of

20
a third party, whether a court or the telephone company, in
this case, is to decide whether the order will be carried out.
We think the Court has ample authority under the' All Writs Act to
effectuate its order, as has been done in many situations in­
volving injunctive orders to third parties, including cases in
which convictions have been upheld for contempt of such .in­
junctions when they were issued to uphold, school desegregation
decrees, for example, and there are other examples which I
really don’t have time to go into.
QUESTIONS
Wallace?

Why do you need the All-Writs Act, Mr.

Doesn’t 41 authorize the issuance of subpoenas and

discovery from persons not parties to the action?
MR. WALLACES

Well, it does, but the contention that

is being made is that it doesn’t authorise the requirement that

\
an unwilling third party assist, in the execution of a. search
warrant,
QUESTION:

Well, is that a matter of substantive law

or of the right form of action, as you understand the conten­
tion?
MR. WALLACE:

I think their contention is a matter of

substantive law, but I'm not sure? I’m not sure, Mr. Justice
Relinquish..

But there is a long history of the use of such

matters, and I — if I may, I just want to refer the Court to
one case. United States v, McKee, which is not cited in the
briefs, 196 Federal Reporter 586, which 3: informed opposing

21

15

counsel about last week.

One has to go back here to IS12 to

find an answer being made in some detail to the contention that
the All Writs Act does not permit writs to foe issued to third
parties^ and the Court's answer at that time was that that
hasn't been the practice at all.

There have been many instances

for the use of the All Writs Act in its history for that pur­
pose.

It's been true of injunction execution, subpoena ad

testificandum, subpoena duces tecum, writ

of prohibition, et

cetera„
It's an argument that one has to go back into history
to find an answer for, and if I may, I'd like to reserve the
balance of my time.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Wallace.

Mr. Ashley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. ASHLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ASHLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please tile

Court, New York Telephone Company is pleased that the Court has
granted certiorari in this case to resolve the, to provide
guidance and to resolve the conflict that exists in the cir­
cuits as to the right of the Government to proceed to get
orders for the installation of pen registers arcl to order the
affirmative assistance of the Telephone Company when it has not
chosen to proceed under Title 3 of the Omnibus Crime Act of
1968

22

We, of course, have no desire to obstruct law en­
forcement authorities in the discharge of their vital func­
tions and, in fact, we have a long history of extensive cooper­
ation in that regard.

At the same time, we also have a long­

standing policy of protecting the privacy of communications to
the maximum extent that is feasible with the needs of law en­
forcement when those exceptions are spelled out by clear re­
quirements of law.
While we believe we do have a legitimate concern
with potential civil liability if the orders that are here
sought are not lawful, and there have been a number of cases
in which the telephone companies have been sued because we’re
sort of in the middle in. this kind of situation, nevertheless
our primary purpose for being here and in cooperating in bring­
ing this matter before the Court is because of its implications
for the protection of the privacy of communications„
Given the extent to which the telephone system is
used for social and business intercourse in this country, we
believe it’s inconsistent with the rights of a free society to
have the privacy invaded any more than is found to be: war­
ranted by clear definitions and exceptions in the statutes.
This Court and Congress have long been concerned with
balancing these two interests.

The history goes back to the

0.1m,stead Case, in 1928, and then to the Nordonne Case in the
Thirties when this Court, on its own initiative, instituted the

23
17
exclusionary rule.

And then you corae on down through the many

cases intervening to the cases in the Sixties, Osborne, Katz
and Burger, which left the whole matter so complex and con­
fused around the country that Congress addressed it head-on in
enacting the Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets Control Act in
1968.

And Title 3 of that act deals very extensively with the

whole matter of electronic surveillance.
We believe that the Senate report indicates that
Congress intended to legislate comprehensively and pre­
emptively in the area of electronic surveillance.
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:

Did the Court of Appeals agree with you?
It agrees, 1' think-, that Title 3 is .

very sweeping and very comprehensive in scope.

It does not

agree that the requirement for pen register is —
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:

Is covered by Title 3?
-«• covered under Title 3.
And you disagree with that?
We think there is certainly a serious

question.
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:

Wall, are you entitled to urge that here?
We believe that it’s implicit in the

issue that's here, because there would be no authority to
order the telephone company to provide the leased line facili­
ties unless the Court also decides that the basic underlying
order was properly granted.

24
QUESTION;
narrower than that.
MR. ASHLEY;
QUESTION;

But the Court of Appeals' opinion is much
It said that Title 3 doesn’t cover this.
You're correct. Your Honor.
If you wanted to Challenge that, you

really should have cross-petitioned, I suppose.
MR. ASHLEY;

Well, it’s ray understanding that the

Government also believes that this is subsumed in the issue
that is before the Court.
QUESTION;

But the Government doesn't bind us

either.
MR. ASHLEY:

No, I think that's true.

But I think

if the Court goes, handles this case and passes upon the requirsment that the telephone company provide leased line facili­
ties under these circumstances, then it will for the first time
really have come to grips with the issue as to whether pen
register orders can be issued outside the scope of Title 3, and
this Court up to this time ban not specifically addressed that
point.
QUESTION;

Well, the Court of Appeals also thought

that Rule 41 authorized issuance of warrants for pen registers,
didn’t it?
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTION;
MR. ASHLEY;
QUESTION:

Yes, the Court —
And you disagree with that?
Yes, wa do, and we think —
Are you urging us to overturn the Court of

25
Appeals in that regard?
MR. ASHLEY:

We!re saying that this case being pro-

perly before the Court, that that issue ought also be addressed
head-on by the Court because of the wide disagreement, not by
circuits, but there have been other —
QUESTION:

But no one has challenged that rule.

MR. ASHLEY:

Well, Judge Oliver in the Western

District of Missouri felt **~
QUESTION:

I know, but nobody's presented that issue

to us in any of the papers here,
MR. ASHLEY:

Well, I think the matter is fully

briefed, Your Honor, in both the Government's brief and —
QUESTIONs

But if we agreed with you, you would be

enlarging tha relief the Court of Appeals gave you?
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTION;

Well, the Court of Appeals —
We'd be giving you relief the Court of

Appeals never gave you.
MR, ASHLEY:

It would be finding that the basic

underlying order is not warranted, and that is not a finding
that has been made by the Court below,
QUESTION:

The relief you did get, though, if you

were to prevail on these, assuming we could entertain your
arguments that the Court of Appeals is wrong in both respects—
MR. ASHLEYs
QUESTION:

We’re merely here —
— if we did, would that support, the

26
order that the Court of Appeals entered?
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTIONs

Our position with respect to —
Or give you a broader order,, which?

MR. ASHLEY: I'm sorry? Your Honor; I didn't under­
stand.
QUESTION:
MR, ASHLEY:

What was the relief you got below?
The relief that was allowed below really

goes to the issue of the extent of the order that should be
directed to the telephone company# and that is the matter that
does directly impinge upon us# and it is the matter in which
there’s a conflict «QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTION:

Well# does that —
— between the circuits.
And would yon be entitled to the order you

got below had you prevailed on your argument that the Safe
Streets Act »—
MR. ASHLEY:

If a different result hacl beer reached

as to whether the Title 3 order was warranted ir, the first
place# there would have been no need to reach the second order.
Thera would have.been no order to the telephone company at all,
under those circumstances.
QUESTION:

Even though you didn't cross-petition,

then aren't you in a position to urge these questione on us?
MR. ASHLEY:

We believe it's inherently involved in

the issue that is before the Court,

27
QUESTION:

The ordinary rule is that you’re entitled

here to defend the order below on whatever ground is available,.
MR. ASHLEY:

And there are various oases to that ef­

fect cited in the Government's brief, in which they agree that
the issue should be addressed,
QUESTION:

Well, you can do that without expanding

your relief, can you not?
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes.

Well, before I move on from that point, I’m. merely
hare urging because of the fundamental nature of it and be­
cause that issue has not been directly addressed by this Court,
even though there are numerous decisions assuming that pen
register orders ara outside the scope of Title 3, that this
Court in providing guidance to the courts around, the country
not start with the previous position and with a closed mind
with respect to that, but instead address that issue in this
case so that it will not be merely assumed without being ad­
dressed and analysed,
QUESTION:

Does this record show that you use pen

registers yourself?
MR. ASHLEY:

Not the record itself, but the briefs

and the statements that we have made.

In fact, we state

positively that the customary use of pen registers is for very
= jurposas within the operation of the telephone business.
For example, we may be required to check on the

23
accuracy of billing;, and this is the way in which that's done.
We may in certain difficult situations where there are harass­
ing calls and things of that sort, we may need to trace a call.
QUESTION:

Indeed, you actually listen in on conver­

sations .

Yes, and in other circumstances —

You do violate the rights of privacy of people.
MR. ASHLEY:

Well, Your Honor, I hesitate to accept

that characterization.

There is certain service observing that

is done on the way l.n which the operators handle a call —
QUESTION?
MR. ASHLEY*

Right.
— but when that is done, those are

timed out so that they do not go into the conversation itself.
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:

But they do listen in —
And the pen register that we're talking

about, when it is -« we do it only to the extent to prevent
fraud and to protect the integrity of the system, so that
there’s no violation of —
QUESTIONS
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTION:

So you do it to prevent violation of law.
Yes.
Nov, what is this pen register for the

29

Government wants?
MR. ASHLEY;

This is one by the Government in which

they want to intercept and listen in —QUESTION;

And prevent violation of the law.

MR. ASHLEY;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, but that, the ex­

tent to which Government has been permitted to use pen regis­
ters has a long history.

It goes back to the enactment of the

Communications Act in 1934, and for the entire period of time
from 1934 until the passage of the act in 1968, the use of pen
registers by law enforcement authorities was prohibited by
Section 605, and the cases are unanimous on that.
QUESTION;

In th* Gallo case it held otherwise?

MR. ASHLEY:

No, the Gallo case had to do with

securing the toll records of the telephone company under sub­
poena, not with the —
QUESTION;
MR. ASHLEY:

Use of pen registers.
use of pen registers.

In fact, in a much, much later case, the Dote Case,
when the Governsent secured the pen register information where
«

the telephone company had used the pen register in the regular
course of its business, it was found that that was an un­
authorized interception by the Government, that they had no
right to those pen registers.
QUESTION;

So that I fully understand, how much

use does New York Telephone Company make of pen registers in

30
the ordinary course of business?
MR. ASHLEY:

They use them when there is a complaint

about a billing error, to check the dialing to see whether the
machinery is working properly and so that the party is truly
billed for the number of calls that they make.

They may be re­

quired in certain instances, limited instances, to trace calls,
and that is done with the consent of the party, and as Mr.
Justice Marshall has brought out, in order to protect the sys­
tem against fraud, to prevent, you know, the use of blue boxes
and things which make calls, enable the making of calls without the charging on a selected basis, there is that sort of —
QUESTION:

Well, what you're telling me, then, I

gather is that it’s the exception, not the ordinary course of
business,
MR. ASHLEY:

Oh, yes, it is not ordinarily done, and

I’m also telling the Court that throughout the long history of
the use of pen registers, that there has been exceptions in the
law for the limited use by telephone companies in the neces­
sary conduct of the business, and that that has been one set
of rules, and the extent to which law enforcement authorities
have had the right to use pen registers has been governed by,
has been prohibited by statute until 1968.
QUESTION:

Well,

would you say to protect the system

against fraud, another way of saying that is to maximize the
company's revem-.es, isn’t it?

31
MRo ASHLEY;

Well, we're required under the Communi-

cations Act to to bill for all calls that, are made, and if
parties are enabled to bypass the billing mechanism and so
forth and perpetrate fraud on the system, we are in r.o posi­
tion then to carry out our responsibility under the Communica­
tions Act to provide service without discrimination and to bill
for all calls that are made.
QUESTION;

Well, are you suggesting that the Communi­

cations Act didn't require you to bill for all calls made,
you wouldn't do that?
MR. ASHLEY;

Well, we also have an independent in­

terest in seeing that we don’t lose the revenue, as well.

Yes,

Your Honor, of course.
QUESTIONs

I suppose as a utility, like railroads and

others, you would not be permitted to tolerate free service to
some customers.
MR. ASHLEYs

That’s correct, it would be an unlawful

rebate or it would be discriminatory as between customers if
that end result were to be permitted.
QUESTIONs

Well, I just wondered, Lave you had any

experience with a law enforcement agency wanting to

get from

you the results of a pen register surveillance that the com­
pany has conducted for its own purposes?
MR. ASHLEY;
QUESTION;

Yes, there are efforts to do that.
And what is the company’s practice then?

32

6

To require subpoena, or what?
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes, we would require a subpoena, but

prior to, if you go bade to the Dote Case, which is no longer
the law because now it would be ruled by whatever the provi­
sions of the Omnibus Crime Bill are, whereas Dote arose under
Section 605, but. the Dote Case was a case in which the tele­
phone company had pen register information, turned it over to
✓
the .law enforcement agencies, and this was held to be an un­
lawful acquisition of that information by the law enforcement
agencies.
In other words, if the telephone company had pen
register information as distinguished from toll billing
records, those were not available to law enforcement agencies
under the —
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:
QUESTION:

Without official process, anyway?
Well, that's right.
I suppose the grand jury could subpoena

them in your hard?
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes; yes.

I'd like to move to the second issue, because while
I do urge the court to address this underlying issue because
there have been numerous decisions«that have assumed that
Title 3 — that pen register surveillance is outside Title 3,
and four justices of this Court in the concurring and dissent­
ing opinion in Giordano assumed t ie same, so it’s .quite an

uphill struggle»

Nevertheless,. I don’t believe the issue has

been directly addressed, and I urge you to do that»
QUESTIONS

Before you leave the point, do I correct­

ly understand that in addition to arguing that Title 3 makes
the underlying order invalid, that there was no authority for
the court to order the pen register, you also argue in the al­
ternative that the underlying order is invalid because not
authorized by Rule 41 or any other Federal principle?
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes, that’s correct.

And we add to that

argument, Justice Stevens, that given the intent of Congress to
act so Comprehensively in this area and the long history that
is behind it, we believe that there ought not. to be assumed
any inherent «power and that since Rule 41 also does not cover
it because of the nature of the rule, dealing with intangibles,
the fact that — there are numerous reasons set forth in our
brief

we believe that Title 3 ought to cover any use that

is made of oer registers or else there should be remedial
legislation.
QUESTION:

Your position is that not only is this

particular order unauthorized by Title 3 or Rule 41, but that
under neither may the law enforcement agencies get a warrant
for a pen register?
MR. ASHLEY:

If they proceed under Title 3, they can,

yes.
QUESTION:

But not elsewhere?

34
MR. ASHLEY:

But not elsewhere,, yes.

QUESTION:

You say if Title 3 doesn’t reach it and

Rule 41 doesn't reach it, then they ought not be permitted
without additional legislation which does authorise it.
MR. ASHLEY:

We believe that pen registers being a

lesser invasion of privacy than full wire-tapping capability
are within the power of the courts to authorize under Title 3.
QUESTION:

If you're wrong about that —

MR» ASHLEY:

Well, if we’re wrong about that, then we

see no authority for it.
QUESTION:

And until there is such authority, you

say no court order can authorize it?
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes.

But we believe if they follow the

procedures under Title 3, and they are getting pen registers
across the country, and we have not resisted cooperating under
those circumstances.

QUESTION;

— for the Court of Appeals took even a

narrower view, I guess, didn’t he?

He said there was power but

that it was an abuse of discretion to exercise it.
MR. ASHLEY:

This is on the second issue, to which 1

would like to turn.
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes, yas.
Because I believe that it: is a very

fundamental issue, and it is, Justice Rehnguist, from our
perspective.- a substantive issue as well as a procedural issue.

35

9

And that is the extent to which courts have the power
to order private citizens, even telephone companies, to active­
ly participate in the act of criminal investigation without ex­
plicit statutory authority to do so,
QUESTIONt

Mow, you consistently equate the telephone

company with private citizens.

Is there not a substantial dif­

ference between the telephone of a private individual and a
utility which has received a monopoly by virtue of a franchise
from the Government?
MR. ASHLEY:
is.

Isn’t there a difference in duties?
Oh, yes, sir.

We don’t deny that there

But we believe that we are private citizens and there are

employees, or private employees, private employer, except to
the extent that, you know, special duties and responsibilities
have been imposed upon us by the regulatory statutes.

And there

is no question but what those are
QUESTION:

But over the years you have construed

that duty also to lead at least, the record suggests, to a good
deal of voluntary cooperation with law enforcement officers.
MR. ASHLEYs

Wd 11, what we’ve clone in the way of

voluntary cooperation, we believe, are within fcv,e «ootv» of
our privileges and rights as a private employer, and we have
responded in these instances to the extent that we believe
it! s —
QUESTION:

You don’t — you don't — then are you

rejecting the idea that as a utility having s. monopoly over

10

36
communications, that, you have a higher duty than the ordinary
citizen?
MRc ASHLEY;

No, we are not rejecting that, but we

say the extent to which that exists is spelled out by statutes,
and it should be spelled out by statutes, rather than be some­
thing that we would assume ourselves without any limitsf par­
ticularly in this instance in which we would be cooperating,
in the invasion of the private use of the telephone system
without explicit statutory authority to that effect.

We don’t

believe wo should assume to do that through any inherent obli­
gation of a public utility.

We believe that that should foe

spelled out.
QUESTION;

In that respect, as Mr. Justice Stewart

suggested, you're disagreeing with Judge Medina's view that
there is authority, but that was an abuse of discretion to
exercise it here?

MR. ASHLEY:

Yes, we believe that there is no actual

power, we believe the Ninth Circuit so held in the application
of the United States case in 1970, which was a Title 3 case.
But on this issue, the secondary issue as to the obligation of
the telephone company, whether it is appropriate for a court
*

to order the provision of leased facilities and the active in­
volvement of the telephone company, on that issue we believe
the Ninth Circuit decision is indistinguishable on the facts
from this.

37
;l
And what happened there was that the telephone com­
pany was ordered to provide lease 15.nes as hare, but in a
Title III situation, the court, the Ninth Circuit held it had
no such power, could find no such power to order it, and felt
it would be unwise to do so without specific statutory author­
ity.
Subsequent to that, then,

it was taken to Congress.

Congress did enact a statute which authorised the telephone
companies to provide these lines when Title III orders were
secured, and under those circumstances, provided immunity in
the statute, the immunity to which my learned colleague here
has made allusion.
/

But he is giving us, he is relying upon

the very statute that he says they do not need to follow in
securing the underlying authority.

He would use the very

Title III which he says does not apply to this case, and which
they do not have to follow, as a basis to give us the immunity,
which I find very strange.
QUESTIONS

Where do you get the authority to put your

pen registers?
MR. ASHLEYs
QUESTION:

Exception —
You said that you do not assume authority

as a public utility; you are just a private cltd.sen.

Well, for

private citizen I have trouble finding authority to put a pen
register in„
MR. ASHLEY:

No, not in this respect we are not

38
52
relying upon our rights as a private citizen.

Under both the

605, the Communications Act before 1968 and under the Omnibus
Crime Bill in 1968, exception was made for the telephone com­
pany in the necessary conduct of its business to do that.
QUESTION;
MR. ASHLEY;

And also to listen in?
Well, only to the extent necessary to

carry out its functions as a telephone company.

If we exceeded

appropriate, you know, bounds in that respect., we would not be
protected either.

Mr. Ashley, you may con­

You have a few minutes left.
MR. ASHLEY;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court, I would like to continue on the point

i
that1 regardless of the validity of the underlying Title III
order insofar as it authorizes the Government.,

that the Court

had no power to order the telephone company to actively par­
ticipate in the act of criminal investigation.

I would just like to say that this is another example
of where we try to strike a reasonable balance between the de­
gree of involvement of the communications common carrier with
the need for the efficient carrying out cf the requirements of
law enforcement.
QUESTION;

The typical recipient of a subpoena, he

does not feel he is entitled to strike the balance himself»
You know, when you're subpoenaed to produce something before a
grand jury, you -know, you are certainly privileged to argue the
subpoena is unauthorized, but I do not think ordinarily a pri­
vate organization feels that its dutv is to make the decision
as to whether to produce or not,
MR. ASHLEY;
true.

No, I think generally speaking that is

Of course, there are questions raised —
QUESTION:

— a subpoena is not used to require,

affirmatively require by specific affirmative action, the active
cooperation of a private citizen with law enforcement agencies?
MR. ASHLEY;

Yes, that was the distinction I was go­

ing to make preliminary to that, I was going to say to Justice
Rohnquist that private parties may raise the question of the
burdensomeness, of course, of the subpoena, and so forth, and
appeal to the sense of equity of the court, but I think the
real distinction —
QUESTION;

Isn't the remedy usually simply to pro­

vide financial compensation where the .issue of burdensomeness

is raised?
MR. ASHLEYs

That certainly is a major factor in

whether the court would decide to go that far ir requiring
discovery.
QUESTION:

The court did supply compensation for you

hsre, did they not?
MR. ASHLEY:

It is prepared to pay for the use of the

facilities cit the regular tariff rate; yes.
QUESTION:

Do you have any — did you challenge the

fairness of the compensation?
MR. ASHLEY:

No, we do not.

That is rot the basis.

The basis is really the precedent for us and for citizens in
general of requiring affirmative participation and acts in a
criminal investigative process.

We believe there is no prece­

dent for that.
QUESTION:

You suggested a precedent this morning:

You do it for your own, in the execution of what you consider
your own mission as a public utility.
MR. ASHLEY:

We do that only in the conduct of our

own business, within what we, you know, is lawful, but —
QUESTION:

You would not want to call that a selfish

interest, because it is not selfish, you have got to collect
your revenues, but you do it for your own purposes, however
appropriate those purposes are.
MR. ASHLEY:

Yes, and so do all citizens and all

41
15

individuals»

But it is extraordinary to expect citizens to

directly involve themselves in the law enforcement process.
The Ninth Circuit found that there was no precedent for that,
and when the matter was presented to Congress, then Congress
did amend Title III and provide that this should he done, but
only when there was a Title III order.

It did not go beyond

that and authorise it, except within those very strict require­
ments of Title III.
QUESTION:

How about posse comitatus?

That is cer­

tainly a traditional way in which citizens are involved in
the law enforcement process, is it not?
MR. ASHLEY:
posse comitatus.

Yes.

You have the precedent of the

You have the precedent of individual citi­

zens in an emergency situation where a felon may be escaping
and a lav enforcement officer asks for assistance.

There are

a couple of cases of that sort that are cited in the petition
by the Government.

One was the opinion by Judge Cardoso and

the Court of Appeals of New York, and another was here in.
Washington involving the Evening Star.

But those incidents

are really a time-honored marshaling of the resources of the
community in an emergency situation which the Ninth Circuit
said it was unwilling to find was a precedent for the kind of
thing which is asked for here, which is ahead of judgment and
without the emergency conditions that you had*
QUESTION:

Why do you feel that the Ninth Circuit

said that absent Title III, they would have reached the result
they did?
MR. ASHLEY:

I was responding to the analogy to the

QUESTION:

How would the Ninth Circuit have acted

with respect to a pen register absent Title III?

You do not

know whether they would have analogized it to a posse comita­
tus or not.

the telephone company could be required to —

QUESTION;

MR. ASHLEY:

No, I do not think so, except insofar as

they said Congress has legislated comprehensively in this
area, and if they intended —
QUESTION:

And

they did not go any farther than

this, so we will stop there.
MR. ASHLEY:

But I think, with all due respect, that

if they felt this was an appropriate power of the court, they
would have been more inclined to do it within Title III, where
there was the basic underlying authority spelled out, than
they would be in a situation where that was not the case.

And

43
57

Congress, as 1 say, came along and authorized it. in Title III
but did not go beyond that and authorize it outside of Title
I

III.
And I think it is very significant that when Congress
acted in this respect — and this goes back to the point that
you, Mr. Chief Justice, asked me just before the luncheon re­
cess — that Congress did not act solely with respect to com­
munications common carriers, but realized that the problem was
with respect to the right to require affirmative assistance of
citizens in general, and the language includes custodians,
property, and other citizens than communications common carriers.

They were all dealt with indiscriminately and the

rights and responsibilities were, no distinction was made be­
tween communications common carriers and others.
QUESTION:

the law and the question as to whether pen registers — Title

Well, I think with the question of the

coverage of Title III, whether pen register interception is in­
cluded within the scope of Title 111 -~
QUESTION:
MR. ASHLEY:

I am not talking about Title III.
— we would raise the question as to

whether we should respond to such —
QUESTION3

If you put a pen register on a man's phone

and you billed them pursuant to the pen register, you would
produce the bill upon subpoena?
MR, ASHLEY:

We would produce our billing records,

yes.
QUESTIONS

Upon the subpoena.

But you would not

produce the pen register?
MR. ASHLEY:

We would certainly raise the same kind

of question we have raised here, because of the precedent that
existed before the enactment of Title 111 in 1968, and raise
the question as to whether that did not carry over now.
There was a distinction made between pen register
records and toll billing records before 1968, and I think if
pen registers are covered under Title III, you have the same
question at least raised as to whether it would not be an in­
direct way of accomplishing the same result.
QUESTION:

Suppose, Fir-. Ashley, that there were wide­

spread complaints in a particular area that pen registers were
being abused by the telephone company for their own purposes

46

0

and perhaps for purposes unnecessary involving invasions of
privacy»
\

Could the Federal Communications Commission require

you by subpoena or other process to produce all of your pen
registers for the purposes of that inquiry?
MR. ASHLEY:

Well, the question had not occurred to

me before, Your Honor,

In investigations involving whether we

are lawfully carrying out our duties, I suppose under proper
safeguards of confidentiality and impoundment and that sort of
thing, yes, they would be, probably would0
■f
QUESTION: Confidentiality for what purpose, to what
end?
MR. ASHLEY:

I

Well, to limit the disclosure only to

the Federal Communications Commission and only within such
circumstances as ware necessary for it to carry out its lawful
functions.
We have had situations like that with respect to
national security matters, and all.

I am speculating with you,

but I think the question, if they had a legitimate investiga­
tion going as. to whether the telephone company was conducting
itself properly and carrying out its functions

under the

act, then I think you would have to set about to try to have
/

the necessary safeguards to prevent the disclosure of the in­
formation to anyone else, but probably under those circum­
stances , it. could be done.
QUESTION:

Do you see a lack of safeguards in the

47
41
present situation?
MR. ASHLEY:
)

Well? I see that there has been a long

history of trying to limit the circumstances under which law
enforcement authorities do get this kind of information, and
there have been throughout decades before, this was unavailable
to them, and Congress in enacting Title III set up only certain
limited crimes and required the permission to be secured from
the Attorney General or his designated assistant in order to
centralise the extent to which electronic surveillance was
available to the law enforcement authorities, and all of that
is circumvented if this can be done outside the scops of Title

.

III.
I would just like in conclusion to call the attention
agai.n of the Court to the pictures which are at the end of our
brief.

Questions were asked earlier about this.
The pen register in the modern version, which is the

last page, is an electronic cabinet about this wide and that
high, with the —- oh, ites about maybe 18 to 24 inches long —
but the modern version has all of these access points where
you can plug in whatever circuits or whatever function you
want to perform.
QUESTION:

Very well.

Thank you, Mr. Ashley.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ashley, our rules require, when the

argument portion of the brief exceeds 20 pagas, that there be
a summary of .irgument -inserted.

I do not think that rule was

48

complied with here, and 1 do suggest that you do it the next
time.

It makes it a little easier for us.

dent for me, and I am sorry if I did not abide by the rule.

Rule 4.1, it did comply in part. It did everything that was re™
quired of it under the warrant except the leasing of the line,
and it well might have felt some obligation to clo so.

It is

not standing hare in the shoes of an ordinary third party, an
innocent bystander.

It not only is a public utility, but there

was a finding of probable cause to believe that its facilities
which it is operating for a profit are being used in the con­
duct of an (interprise violating the criminal law in circum­
stances where it would be very difficult to conduct the enter­
prise without the use of the telephone company's facilities.
I

And that matter should not be lost sight of when arguments are
made generalizing about bystanders and whether courts can im­
pose duties on them.
The second point is that Title III, not only does the

legislative history specifically disclaim that it is intended
to limit the use of pen registers, but if Title III were to be
applied in this area, it would be a very serious interference
with the legitimate use of pen registers in criminal investiga
tions.
Title III, because it deals with wire-tapping, over­
hearing the contents of telephone communications, is very
restrictiveo

Net only are there cumbersome procedures to fol­

low which are quite time-consuming, but the list of crimes for
which it. can be used is quite limited, whereas pen registers
can be very useful in the investigation of escaped fugitive
offenses, civil rights act offenses, and various* others that
we have mentioned in the footnote in our brief that are not
covered by Title III,
Since we here complied with all the requirements
that would be necessary in order to be able to get a search
warrant to go into someone's premises and search through his
papers, there is no reason to limit a far less intrusive in­
vestigatory technique which can be very useful in these areas
of detecting criminal activity.
And finally —
QUESTION:

Well, your search warrant analogy

but

you do not compel the person whose place is being searched to
help you.
MR, WALLACE:

Well, it is not the individual whose

50

4

telephone is being used who is compelled to help in these cir­
cumstances , it is the telephone company, whose facilities are
being used.
QUESTIONt

Well, if you are searching a hotel room,

you do not coma in, you do not order the proprietor of the
hotel to help search.
MR. WALLACE:

There may be circumstances in which he

can be asked to cooperate in executing the search if his help
is needed to gain access.

There is a provision in Title XVIXI,

Section 3105, which indicates that when needed, parsons can be
required to help in the execution of a search warrant, but we
do not rely on that here.

But it is not an unprecedented or

unheard of thing.
QUESTION:

The proprietor can furnish a key to get

in the room •—
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct; that is the kind of

help that I am speaking of, and we frequently do get that
kind of help when someone is operating a facility for profit
and that, facility is being used in furtherance of criminal
enterprise, or at least there is probable cause to believe
that.
I

My final point is, what about the absence of action
by Congress here, other than its indication in the legislative
history of Title III that the use of pen registers is not to
be restricted?

51
The contention of the telephone company in effect is
that in the absence of action by Congress, the telephone com­
pany rather than the court is to decide whether an order of
this kind can be carried out when the telephone company’s
facilities are needed.
But I think that the jurisprudence of this Court is
to the contrary.

Of course, Congress is free to act.

There

is a case cited at page 18A of the appendix to the petition
for certiorari by Judge Mansfield in his dissenting opinion.
In the middle of the page there is a quotation from, this is
page 18A, there is a quotation from this Court's opinion in
Adams v. United States ex rel, McCann, in which a unanimous
Court, speaking through Mr, Justice Frankfurter — it was
unanimous on this point — upheld the authority of a Court of
Appeals to issue a writ of habeas corpus in circumstances
where the Court of Appeals concluded 'that there were obstacles
to the taking of a pro se appeal that warranted using habeas
corpus for review.
QUESTIONi

That was not ~—

MR» WALLACE:

Wall, they split on the merits, but

they were unanimous that it was proper for the Court of
Appeals in that case to use the extraordinary writ, and the
point that 2 want to make is that the quotation that appears
in the ? dddle of the page there leaves out the first part of
the sentence, but the first part of the sentence by a careful

52

judicial craftsman, speaking on behalf of the Court, reads;
"Unless appropriately confined by Congress, a
federal court may" et cetera,,
The idea is that in the absence of action by Congress
there is power in the courts, and it should be exercised in
order to effectuate the court's orders, and if Congress wants
to specify another method of proceeding, that, of course is
part of the legislative authority, and that is one reason why
we think it is more respectful of that authority to rely on
the All Writs Act, rather than a concept of inherent power
which seme of the Courts of Appeal have preferred in this area»
But there is no reason to think that in the absence
of action by Congress, someone other than the courts should
decide whether these warrants should be effectuated.
Mil. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

Thank you., gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:12 o’clock, pem., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted0)
