MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj

We'13. resume arguments

in Carter against Miller»
Mr» Masur, you may proceed»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT MASUR, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR» MASUR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
Luther Miller is an ex-offender, who was denied &
license necessary to seek employment in the city of Chicago as
a public chauffeur.
Before the Court today is a question as to the
constitutionality of that part, of the ordinance which bars
his Ecensure for life.
Unfortunately, Luther Mller*s story is altogether
too familiar in our society todaj.

A nan convicted of a felony

prior to the time he reached twenty years of age.

A man who

was sentenced to serve a term in prison and who, upon release,
c-L an adult, finds himself faced with numerous occupationally
disabling requirements,
QUESTION* Would your case be any different, would
the issue be any' different if his conviction had been at the
age of forty, let us say# instead of twenty?
MR. MASUR:

No, Your Honor»

similarly be unconstitutional«

The ordinance would

24
At. -tii® very 1iime when Mr. Miller's need for a job
is most acute, at the very time when it is most important for
him to attempt to establish himself as a reputable member of
the society, he finds that -the collateral consequences of his
conviction males it difficult for him to find employment.
Such was the case fox* fir. Miller.

Nina and one-half

years after his conviction, Miller applied for a public
chauffeur's license from the City of Chicago.

The license

is a prerequisite for a number of common unskilled jobs in the
City of Chicago, including private bus driver's, private
chauffeurs, and, most typically, taxicab drivers.
Miller’s application was denied because the ordinance
her® at question prohibits the 3.:' censure for life of anyone
who is convicted of en offense involving the use of a deadly
weapon.
No pardon from fchs @xe«utive, the State of Illinois.
No certificates of rehabilitation from a court of law.

No

conduct, which Mr. Miller might engage in subsequent to his
conviction, lawful conduct, will in any way remove that bar.
Mr. Miller's story is, therefore, both typical and
atypical in our society today.

It is typical because there

are, in fact, numerous occupational disqualifications which
are applied to ex-offenders.
It is for that reason that th© American Bar

Associa­

tion filed its; .amicus brief in this case, and it is for that

25

reason that; the ABA has: generally bean leading a nationwide
drive to remove the kind of disabling 11censura requirements
which is before the Court today.
This ordinance Is atypical because it is the most
sever® and restrictive ordinance that at least counsel for
the respondent has ever encountered.
QUESTIONS

If your argument were sustained, I suppose

the City of Chicago could revert to & policy of automatically
revoking licenses for — on the basis of conviction of a felony
for those who already have them, as well as denying them»
without violating equal protection.
MR. MAS UR:

Your Honor.* our argument does not rest

solely on whether or not a licem-ee may keep his license after
conviction. The statute, the ordinance as a whole is irrational.
Th® terms ~QUESTION: Well, what d< you mean "the ordinance aa
a whole is irrational"?
MR. MAS UR s

Is that what we're here to decide?

Your Honor, wa are only here to decide

a single specific part of the ordinance, but the ordinance —•
QUESTION:

But under what provision of the

Constitution do you say wa are empowered to decide that it is
irrational?
MR. MASURs

Th® ordinance — th© issue before the

Court is aha single question as to whether or not th® lifetime
ban, as to. Mr. Miller for conviction of aa offense involving

26
use of a deadly weapon, is unconstitutional.
QUESTIONS

Under what provision of the Constitution?

MR. HAS UR;

Th@ equal protection clausa and the due

p rocess clausa.
QUESTION.; Well, if your argument, under the equal
protection clause were sustained, couitdn't that be cured by
simply making exactly the same ban applicable to those who
already have licenses?
MR* MASUR:

No, Your Honor, because — and I intend

to get into it more completely later: but the basic — the
fact is that whan you. examine the ordinance as a whole, which
I believe you must, and not simply isolate one specific
disabling offense, the — one car ess®, as was demonstrated
yesterday, that the disabling offense does not serve rationally
th© purpose that the City articulates as its only defense,
which is to protect public safety«
QUESTION:

Bub surely Hr. Justice Rahnquist is

correct, the implications of his question.

So far as the
> ;

equal protection clause goes, if there are no more classifica­
tions , then there cannot.be invidious classifications and
your equal protection clause argument would fail if Chicago
treated all —* both of these? classifications identically; i.@.,
applicants for licenses and those who already have licenses.
And anybody convicted of .an offense involving a gun is
disqualified from e. license.

Thin there would be no further

27
classifications.
MR® MAS UR s Thar© are further classifications,. Your
Honor, because til© ordinance is ,-x unified systam, and there
are people who am subject to an eight-year ban on licensure.
People who have been convicted of misdemeanors involving moral
turpitude., and all other felonies, other than a very select
few.

Those are the felonies who are only subject to an eight-

year ban, and include such people as have been convicted of
murder by strangulation — that is., to say, not involving a
deadly weapon.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if Chicago treat ad both licensees

and applicants precisely the same with respect to this kind of
a disability, an offense involving a gun, or those disabilities
involving an eight-year ban., or whatever, there would be no
more classifications for you to complain about.
Would there?
MR. MAS UR:

Is n not si: re that I am understanding,

Mr. Justice Stewart*

There are a number of classifications

set up by the ordinance.
QUESTION: And if Chicago obliterated all of them,
and treated all, both applicants and licensees, identically —
MR. MASURs

And prohibited the licensure of anybody

who was convicted of any offense.
QUESTION: whatever they wanted to do, so long as
they didn't create any differences, any distinctions between

28

applicants and licensees.
MR. MASUR:

If there ware an ordinans© before “she

Court, which it. obviously isn’ f„, if an ordinance were before
tha Court which involved simply raying anybody ever convicted
of anything may never get a license —
QUESTION:

And any license© who was convicted of

anything loses his license.
MR, MASUR:

That’s right.

It is our position that

such an ordinance would also be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:
MR. MASUR;

Uiider the equal protection clause?
Yes, Your honor.

Because that kind ©f a

disproportionate treatment, as between somebody who was
convicted of an offense"15, 20 years ago, and someone who was
never actually convicted of an offense, the disproportionate
result teat’s created is — would violate the equal protection
clause.

That, for example, was
QUESTION:

You wouldn't, use tee Eighth Amendment

while you’re at it, cruel and ini'.uman punishment?
MR. MASUR: We raised tee issue, Your Honor, in the
trial court, but we have not — we have not —
QUESTION:

That’s a cruel and inhuman punishment to

tell a man teat he can’t; have & likens© to drive a car?
MR. MASUR:

Ky unde rat* nding of tee case law, Your

Honor, is that cruel and unusual punishment do»is not apply
to licensing situations like this , although I think teat it is,

in a sensa, cruel and unusual,
QUESTIONs
MR, MAS UR:

Well, you just: don't; agree with the law,
In that particular case* perhaps not,

Your Honor,
In Jamas v, Strang®, for example, where the State
of Kansas had a legitimate, as recognized by tie

Court, a

legitimate interest in recouping money from persons convicted
of an offense, when the State paid for their defense.
Nonetheless, -inis Court held, despite their legitimate interest,
that the disproportion&lity that was involved -Share —
QUESTIONs Thera were classifications in that case,
weren* t the ns ?
MR, MAS UR: Surely, the:-;.© were classifications as
between those persons end others 'who had not been in prison ~~
there are classifications here, too, Mr, Justice Stewart,
There would be a classification between all people —
QUESTION:

Justice Rehnquist's question was:

If you prevail on your equal protaction clause claim, couldn't
Chicago immediately solve, say, the constitutional defect by
simply treating licensees the

see s

as applicants.

And your

answer is no; I don’t quite understand why you say no, but I
understand that your answer is no, they couldn’t.
So you — I don’t want to take any more of your time.
MR. MASUR:

The licensing schema ■— and it is our

opinion that you cannot divorces the particular clause that’s

30

before the Court from the entire scheme — the licensing
scheme sets up a general system to evaluate the character and
reputation of ©very single applicant for a license.
QUESTIONS Are you saying that your client can raise
difficulties which you conceive to b© inherent in the licensing
scheme which did not. affect the denial of the license to him?
MR. MAS UR s

The difficul-fci.es that are inherent in

tills licensing scheme go to the rationality of the entire
schema as applied to tills particular clausa.
The ordinance -- and ti ls is Chapter 28.1-4
provides that 81 If the commissioner shall b© satisfied that
the applicant is of good character and reputation and is a
suitable person to be entrusted with driving a public passenger
vehicle ha shall issue the license."
As part of that decision that the Commissioner must
make in every single case, the Commissioner is empowered to
look into an applicant's employment history# his reputation
in the community, his physical qualifications# whatever the
Commissioner deems relevant for character and fitness.
There is# therefore# ar evaluative mechanism to
deal with every single applicant# except —» and that is
licensees and applicante alike — except as far as Mr. Miller
is concerned# and -die other few people who are barred for life
by this ordinance.
Hie licensing scheme hers# established by tha Chicago

31
Public Chauffour5 s Ordinance, creates & crazy quilt: of
categories and disabilitj.es, similar or identical offenses
are treated differently , past employment is sometimes relevant
and sometimes it isn’t relevant.

Character and fitness is

always relevant, except, when it isn't.
Thus, Luther Millar, who was convicted 13 years ago

of an offense involving the use of a deadly

weapon, but a

licensee who was convicted yesterday may retain his license„
Someone convicted of murder by strangulation,
kidnapping fo:c ransom, battery, ray be licensed after eight
years? Miller may never be licensed.

And people with drunk

driving records have no disability whatsoever.
QUESTION:
MR. MASUR:

I beg your pardon?
People with drunk driving histories have

no presumptive disability whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Oh, presumptive, wall

MR• HAS UR: Th at’s right.
QUESTION:

You left it out before©? you left out a

word.
I’m sure it was accidental.
MR. MASUR:

Yes.

Yes.

Presumably every applicant’s

past history earn be evaluated by the Commissioner. That’s
what makes this ordinance so irrational.

We are not saying

to this Court teat the Commissioner may not. consider —
QUESTION: Are you alleging teat in the State of

32
Illinois the Commissioner investigates every applicant for
a chauffeur’s driver’s license, os to his character, his
employment, ot cetera?
MR, MASUR:

Yes, Your Honor, that's what the

ordinance provides.

And how many ©f those a year?

QUESTIONS

Is it that you don’t know?

MR. MAS UR:

Yes, Your Honor,,

Yesterday the issue that was discussed most before
the Court was the issues as to the distinction between, licensees
and applicants.

And ti.se Court —■ th® Commissioner admitted

that the only purpose for the public chauffeur’s ordinance was
'io protect the public safety»
At the same time the Commissioner admitted that the
treatment ©f licensees had no relevance to the question of
public safetyj and, indeed, that the scheme turns reality on
its head*

That recent convictions become far more relevant

as to safety 'Shan past convictions.
QUESTION s

Is it your position that, ;a statutory

scheme of this kind is unconstitutional because it protects
the public against soma of the hazards but not all of the
hazards of having ex~felons driving taxicabs?
MR. MAS UR:

No, Your Honor.

It’s our position that

the irrational classifications created by -this ordinance, and
the disproportionate results that follow from it, do not in
fact

are not in fact

rational ly related to the only

articulated purpose for the ordinance, which is fee protect
th© public safety.
QUESTION:

I don’t —- your contention, therefore,

is that the city Council of Chicago, which is th© body that
enacted this ordinance — right?

Is 'that; it?

definition of lunacy, so *—
MR. MASUR;

I think that this ordinance is not

This ordinance, Your 1 ©nor, I think, is properly

viewed within the context of tradition;?.! offender disabilities
that have bean imposed upon people who once committed a crime.
Traditionally those disabilities grew out of a societal
desire to ostracise, to continue to ostracize, in fact to
prohibit th® re-integration of offenders into society.
QUESTION;

But our 1; vr is full of examples in

«very State of the Union, I would b® almost certain, and very,
perhaps very, very unwisely, as you and th© ABA and others
sayi but lack of wisdom doesn’t mean unconstitutionality.
MR. MASUR;

Wall, first, of all, the —- although

there are numerous laws across the country ~~
QUESTION: All sorts of disabilities imposed upon
eoavict®d feIons.
MR. MASUR;

That's correct, Your Honor, but 'die

fact is that most of those disability ordinances and statutes
are nowhere near as severe as this, and in fact the goner»!
trend in the country is to remove them or to —
QUESTION; By legislative action, right?

35
MR. MASUR:
QUESTION:

By legislative action.
Perhaps thafc's very, very wise, as you

say. But that does not have anything to do with the
constitutionality of

those laws.

MR. MASUR: But this ordinance, Your Honor, it is
our contention that —
1
QUESTION2
isn’t, I know.

Well, your contention is that, this on©

I understand.

MR. MASUR:

— that this is irrational.

Take, for example, the Commissioner says this is
for the public safety. And for the public safety w© must ban
people for life who committed an offense 13, 20 years ago.
He chooses, first of all, to ban people convicted of
the use of a deadly weapon.

As our brief establishes, you

could be convicted of the most minor

misdemeanor and fall

within tills lifetime ben.
In addition, the lifetime ban includes people
convicted of incest, or of the infamous crime against nature
which I believe is sodomy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Masur, just to pursue Jus tic,:
do
Rehnquisfc’s question befor®,/you really have standing to
complain about other people who are included in the ordinance,
who committed loss serious offenses than yc-ur client did?
New, we*re dealing with the question of whether the ordinance
can constitutionally be applied to one who committed armed

36

robbery 0

Is it, therefore, relevant to ask about people who

may have been convicted of unlawful possession of a hunting
knife? or something like that?
MR0 MASUR:

I believe it is? Your Honor? because the

ordinance as a who las —■ we’re not asking the Court to declare
unconstitutional that part of the ordinance which is not
before it? clearly? but -the ordinance as a whole goes a long
way in establishing whether or not in fact this is a rational
scheme that the City has set up, as applied to my client?
Luther Miller.
And it is our contention that if the Court looks at
the ordinance as a whole? examines tha categories that it
establishes
QUESTION:

Well, say wr agree with you that it’s

irrational to include incest? would that entitle your client
to relief?
MR» MASUR:

Not simply that, Your Honor, I agree.

However? the fact -QUESTION:

Or say we agree it’s irrational to include

misdemeanors involving a deadly weapon? would that entitle
your client to relief?
MRo MASUR:

The fact that these offenses are

included in a lifetime ban is an indication that what was
motivating the City Council, th® infant behind this ordinance
is not as th© Commissioner has argued before this Court, but

37
that there was soma attempt to pick out, to choose those
offenses which th@ City Council was morally upset by, and to
ostracise those people for life»

In that sense, the inclusion

of the armed robbery or the use of the deadly weapon within
there falls —~ it's some indication that in fact this is not
at all necessary, as they indicatis, to protect the public
safety»
In addition, Mr» Justice Stevens, the City has the
evaluative mechanism for every single applicant to determine "
QUESTION:

Wo11, they could have don® a better job

that’s true» But as stair® they had mixed motives, assume some
members ©f the Council thought they really ought to punish
people who have ever dons anything wrong in society, so don’t
let them ever drive a cab»
But some members of the Council thought there's
also a safety problem here, and people who hava committed
armed robbery do pose a greater* threat to the safety of
passengers than others de»

Would the mixed motivation deprive

the ordinance of rationality?
MR* MASUR:

Not in and of itself, but the mixed
t

motivation has? lad to en ordinance which is not in fact
rationally — does not in fact rationally further the goals
which they have established.
It Is also disproportionateMr» Justice Stevens,
in the sense teat they have chosen certain crimes and there's

38

a lifetime bar.

In fact, the City, in its opening briefs

on page 28, says something to tho effect that;

admittedly,

tile decision as to whether or not to impose a five-year ban
or a ten-year ban or a lifetime ban, is somewhat

arbitrary.

And those are the Commissioner’s words.
Well, if it were a five-year ban or a ten-year ban,
Hr, Miller would now bsi eligible for a license,
QUESTION;

It's your position that tie City in this

case justified every single one of the provisions of this
ordinance?
MR, MASUR:
QUESTION:
MR, MASUR;
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor,

It is ~

I thought that's what you said,
Mo, Your Honor, —
You said that it showed what their

motive is,
MR, MASUR:

What I'm suggesting to the Court is that

the — by looking at the ordinance as a whole, one can
ascertain that in fact this ordinance was not asteblished
for the sols purpose which they have — the Commissioner has
articulated today.

That as a general licensing schema, it is

irrationale
As to all ether licensing provisions in the City of
Chicago, they simply rely on a character and fitness standard,
QUESTIONs And my question again is:

that requires

th© City to justify each provision as being "rational”.

39
MR«MASUR: Well; it is true —
QUESTION:

Is that the burden of proof you want to

put on the City?
MR. MASUR:
QUESTION:

I don't think it’s a burden, of ~
Or is that the burden you want us to put

on th® City?
MRo MASUR:

I don't

no, Your Honor; but th©

fact is, of course, that th© City has ignored all of th©
other provisions in the ordinance, other than the immediate one
before; and that is, in ray opinion, because
QUESTION:

Well, then you say that th® City now

has to justify as.oh one, including incest?
MRo MAS UR:

I believe that th© City, in coming before

the Court and saying to the Court:
ance is public safety
say:

the purpose of this ordin­

is required to com© to th© Court and

th© position of Mr. Miller within that scheme is a

rational — he is being rationally treated as related to all
other people*

QUESTION: Supposa th© only probition were the one

still say it was unconstitutional?

Mr. Chief Justice# in saying if only-

armed robberies could not get a license and everybody els©
was eligible for licensura# would it be rational?

No# I

believe it would not b® rational* Because the City Council
would be in the position of setting out one group ©f persons#
a classification# and treating them radically differently
iron all other identically or similarly situated people# and
not just that th© treatment is different but that the
disproportionality of the* treatment is so great*
On the one hand# somebody is eligible immediately

Rationality as a criterion of constitutionality
want out. about forty years ago,

I thought»

Pcarhtps x mis­

understood.
MR. MAS UR:

Well, perhaps I chose the wrong word.

1 believe that it would be invidiously discriminatory as well,
Mr» Justice Stewart, to set up the licensing scheme that
looked like that»
As I indicated before, and I think it is appropriate
for the Court to look to the history of discrimination that
has been imposed on ex-offenders.

Ex-offenders, as a group,

are people who have no political power indeed, to —* mi til vary
recently, in most States they were denied the right to vote»
Because they are in that position, they are subject to this
kind of an ordinance, which allows the City to say to a person,
"If you have done something one©, the rest of your life is
meaningless in terms, at least, of seeking employment through
any licensing agency in the City of Chicago."
I think that it is important, therefore, that the
Court look to ~~ carefully at the ordinance, and not simply
to see whether -there ia a — whether- there is a line that
»

|

somehow might be acceptable here.
The ordinance, as the ABA points out, and a:;
presidential commissions have pointed out, is contrary to good
public policy.

Most Statas, or many Statas, including Illinois,

42

have rejected the presumptions behind this kind of an ordinance,
In Illinois, all licensing schemas provide that a conviction
may be taken into account; — which we have never denied here
— but they may not, in end of themselves, be presumptive bars.
The City of Chicago, for all purposes, except this
ordinance and one or two others, does exactly the same.
To deny a person the right to seek employment,
which is, after all, if not a fundamental right under this
Court’s holding, certainly a very important right, is certainly
unwise and in fact, in our opinion, unjust.
1 believe that there is substantial precedent from
this Court to establish the unconstitutionality of this
ordinance.

This is — the ordinance is disproportionate in

the sens© that Jamas v. Strange was.
rr-rurr* r 'ir-in. r-v -- »-rr3r - mkS' . r.nm+.mr

i^r

Schware vs . E-oard of Bar_ Sasaminens establishes that
in order to consider somebody for a license — in that case it
was a bar license **- one must.' look at their present fitness
for licensure.
QUESTION: Was that an equal protection case?
MR. MAS UR:

It was decided under the due process

clauss, Mr. Justice Stewart, but in In rs Griffiths, which was ■
an equal protection case, the Court cited and relied upon
Scl:.war©, and again condemned undifferentiated bars to employ­
ment.
Wq baliev® th© ordinar.ca hers* before the Court is

43
unconstitutional# that indeed without wishing to engage in
hyperbola# that it is contrary to many of the notions which
go verm our society; which, is to say that an individual ought
•ho h&v© the right; and the opportunity to seek — to improve
;an& to advance himself c.

And that to hold against him bacause

of a serious mis taka which h© mads as a youth# or as a young
man# is contrary to the notions on which we generally govern
ourselves.
QUESTION:
MR* MASUR:
QUESTION:

Mr. M&sur# —
Yes# sir?
— may I ask you two questions?

First# you attack the classification between
licensees and applicants on the ground that the justification
forth© ordinance does not justify that classification.
Well# perhaps the classification could be justified
by some other consideration, that generally

your opponent

argues that the right, to a job should be more respected in
the case of one who has the job than one who is merely seeking
thr. job.

What do you say about the validity of that general

justification for this kind of distinction?

I think he

acknowledged that it was not supported by case law

except

to the extent that hearings are provided in Roth and so forth.
Well# you haven't really attacked the classification
in general terms# apart, from th© fact that it doesn't *—■ that
it isn't related spacifically to the justification for this

44
ordinance»

Do you accept the validity of his distinction

otherwise or not?
MR» MAS UR:

No, Your Honor, I — the Commissioner

suggests two justifications for that distinction between
licensees and applicants»

One of them is a track record,

and, as w© point out, a license® in fact may not have a track
record at all»

Indeed, the irony is that the license®, even

if he has a track record, her® is a person who commits a
crime while ho1s a license©»
In addition, the track record argument doesn't deal
with the fact that an, applicant may have ssi employment
history, not driving a cab generally, but equally long or
longer than the cab driver»

And finally, even if — and this

turns more to his argument that essentially thara is an
interest involved *— even if the licensee has more of an
inherest in taking his -- in keeping his license, than the
applicant does in getting it, there is no justification in
cans a law for imposing differential standards as between
licensees and applicants»

And, indeed, even if th© interest

is there, the die proportionate rcssu.lt, in light of tha fact
that the license» has just committed a crime and my client
committed a, crime 13 years ago, the disproportionate result
makes it irrational.
QUESTION;

My second question, perhaps I shouldn't

ask, is th© Luther Miller in this case th© same as in Miller v

45
Toomey?
MR. MAS UR;

I believ© SO; Your Honor.

Thank you vary much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You h&va anything further,

Mr. Quinlan?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. QUINLAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, QUINLAN:

Just a few comments; Mr. Chief

Justice.
In response to Justice Stavoas* question of yesterday
and today, with the differential treatment, it's our feeling
that there has been so»© misconception in what the burden ©f
tha City is hare, and primarily who has the burden.
I think we’d all agree, if we'.re talking about
equal protection, then tea burden is primarily not that of
the legislative body or ‘the City in establishing justification
for the classification, it is presumed to be valid. And then
the second issue is whether or not there really is any
justification for treating the two classifications or two
parties differently.
And w-a submit: that there is a basis for treating
thorn differentlyf and that primarily i» because one has status
of being on tha job cr having a license, and has a greater
interest, said that must be considered in terms of this
Court’s rulings in Roth sad Sindermann, in terms of making

46

sura that it is not arbitrarily deprived and they are
entitled to a hearing, and they are entitled to more rights
and more consideration»
This has been traditionally the case in all instances
in dealing with individuals who have employment and individuals
who don't have employment? that their rights, that is, the
rights of the individual on the job, are greater than the
rights of the individual not on -the job» That does not suggest
that they can be arbitrarily dealt with, but they are dealt
with differently»
And we ares submitting that the test or the burden
of the City is not to demonstrat® there is not invidious
discrimination, and that there is a rational relationship,
but tliis is conclusively related to public safety»
But our burden is really to show that there is some
reason for treating the classes differently, and the burden
is on the* other side to show that there is no reason»

And

we submit that, there is. reason for taating the parties
differently»
And what we have liars also is a two-tier problem»
The first problem is tc- determine whether or not it is

reasonable to treat people who are convicted of a crime
dealing with a weapon differently than others» Wo submit
it is related to the goal of protecting tha traveling public
in, cabs»

That has been accepted by the court below, and we

47
think it is rational to submit that that is related to ifcc
Secondly, is there any basis for treating licensees,
that is incumbents, and applicants differently?

We submit

yes, that the rights and the interests at stake are different,
and that in the case of incumbents or licensees, Roth,
Sindermann require that they be given further rights and
farther benefits than do applicants, or are applicants
entitled to receive*
