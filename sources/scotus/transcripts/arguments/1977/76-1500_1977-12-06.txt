MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. O’Malley, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE P. O’MALLEY, ESQ. ,
ON BEIIALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. O’MALLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

t.i© Court:
This Court has granted the petition of the Commonwaalth of Massachusetts to isuue a write of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Thu basic issue raised on review concerns the
constitutionality of applying the federal excise tax on the us©
of civil aircraft to a State police helicopter owned by the
C xnmonwe&lth of Massachusetts and used exclusively for public
s s.£ety purposes.
Tha action was initiated by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts on a petition for a refund of the
tax.

The tax is computed by $25 flat fee plus & varying amount

based on the weight of the aircraft»
tha taxable year ended June 30, 1971»

The tax was $131,43 for
The total collected by

a levy on funds of the Commonwealth was $183,38.
The Coxtanonwsalth alleged in its complaint ~~
QUESTIONs

And that’s what's before us, 180 bucks?

4
MR* O’MALLEYs

For this taxabia year, Your Honor,

a hat’s not en accurate indicator of how ranch money would be
involved in the years between now and then.
QUESTION;

How many aircraft, do as tha Sta-ce of

K as s ach us e tts h av® ?
MR. O’MALLEYj

The State police has one, th-a State

Aeronautics Commission has three, and there’s a large bill
pending for those aircraft also*
QUESTION:
MR.

Yes.

O’MALLEY;

But it hasn’t been litigated.

It’s

now in abeyance pending disposition of this case.
QUESTION;

Also there’s what?

MR. O’MALLEY:

Other aircraft owned by the

Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission. And there are tax bills
in abeyance of a much larger figure than the $180 we’re
talking about, which is strictly for this year 1971.
The Commonwealth alleged that the helicopter was
used by the State Police only for public safety purposes,
sach as promoting highway safety and conducting searches for
sospected criminals or escapees from correctional facilities.
The United States moved to dismiss the complaint for
f lilure ho state a claim upon which relief could i>@ granted.
The district court allowed the motion, stating that the
decisions of this Court talking about State immunity from
federal taxation were essentially of historical interest only,

5
aad t3i© Court also stated that this is a classic c&s© of a
-aasr fee 3
That rational© was based on th© fact that th® r®v©a'oe

w
darivod from these aircraft taxes is used to make grants to
Stats-owned airports for airport expansion and development.
Oa appeal, the Uuitsd States Court of Appeals affirmed th®
judgment of the district; court, but only discussed

user
/

tm

rationale.

That rationales was based largely on an analogy

between ■»- concerning cases of this Court which have hald
wharfage foes by municipalities as rat in violation ©f th©
constitutional prohibition ag.ain.st duties oa tonnage.
Th© Commonwealth petitioned this Court
9

for certiorari.

Th© Solicitor General agreed that the case should be resolved,
because there is a decision by a federal court in Georgia,
which has sustained the immunity of Georgia from this particulas;’
tax,
Th® essential position of th© Commonwealth that this
particular tax violates th© constitutional principle of inter­
governmental tax immunity.»

Th© basic defense of the united

States its that this tax is also a user1© £@© and therefor©
exempt from the principle.
f

la the Commoas-jsalth view, the argument will be broken
emm into thr-ss© basic parts.

First of all, that : share is no exception to th©
principle of intergovernmental tax immunity for taxes which are

6

also designated user fees.
Second, that even if wa discuss th® user fe®
rationale, th© fe&x in question', even fails ©a those terms»
r

And, third, X would briefly discuss the implications
of the case of the Hatignal League of Cities vs, Usery, conearning the position of th© Commonwealth here.
QUESTIONS Did the Court of Appeals ©v@r address its*l£ to the question of whether tha general language of this
statuta neant that th® tax should b© applicable to th© Stateowned vehicles?
MR. O’MALLEYs

It was agreed by all that th® Common*»

wialth does emm within the definition, because th® definition
concerned all aircraft which e.m registered or must be
r agister:id with the ERA.

Thie aircraft was registered, sad,

W'j believe, must b® registered with th© FAR.
QUESTION*

There is some language in soma of our

css©» which is treated in part in th© Frey case, which cam®
out th® other way, X think. That even though you have general
language, sometimes you require more than that in order to
apply a particular regulation or tax to a Stato.
MR. O’MALLEY;
f

There is also legislative history,

Your Honor, which explains why fch® exemptions from the
piisssnge:?’ tax that used iso exist for government- employees is

no longer in effect, and the legislative history states that
■they think all aircraft should pay their way for the use of the

7
aircraft system, so that issue was never really raised, end we
don’t” contest the applicability of the tax a;s a matter of
s tatutory cons truction*
w
Tha tax is clearly n tax, irraspsctiv© of whether or
arc we also describe it as a user’s fee.

As such, it clearly

comas within the scope of tee principle, as historically a tat-ad.
First; of all, it; is a direct imposition on tee funds of th@
Commonwealth of Massachusetts? second of all, ©van though the
a aount of the tax is not excessive in direct terms, it* s only
$131 for this year, in @11 decisions concerning th® principle
of tax immunity, whether it’s federal immunity or State immunity,
tie Court has always stated teat the amount is immaterial.
The basic issue is whether or not there is an infringement of
sovereignty, not; whether or net the tax in question is
V

excessive.
And it, also is a
QUESTION:

Mr. O’Malley, what if 120 or 130 years

a jo , whenever it. was a crucial national issvsa, the federal
government had built a tell read over tee Appalachians and
charged everybody who was pulling a wagon over teat tell road
whatever, say a dollar? do yoi: think a State could have claimed
1

immunity from teat sort of a charge?
MR. O’MALLEY;

No, wa do not, Your Honor.

If a

particular charge is not a tax, but strictly a fee, such as a
tell, for tee us© of a particular road owned by the United

8

States, we would not claim free usage of the road, just ns w©
do not claim,

as-di© government says, that we think we should

b© able to use fcha mails for free, w@ have to bay ’die stamps
r

like everyone sis©.
QUESTION: Even though you*»® performing a. sovereign
fancti on in using them?
MR, O’MALLEY;

Yes, You» Honor, the crux of th© issue

is that ;',t‘s & direct imposition on the Commonwealth’s funds
for the general support of government, rather than th©
individual act of a proprietor trying to get compensation for
tie use of his facilities.
QUESTION:

And you’d say this if the wagons wm

carrying ammunition to Valley Forg-a?
MR. O’MALLEY:

A later Valley Forge.

Wall, Your Honor, if we proved as

a factual matter it was a greet infringement, on the sovereignty
bacauses of a unique fact Ilk® that, X think maybe that would
bs a separate esse.

But as a general proposition, the

proprietorship type fee, w© do not challenge.
QUESTION: Then you leave me a little confused there».
That for soma purposes the Stats — the federal government
make a us® charge, but, for soma purposes they could not.
4

And

on each of them, the.re are two sides.
MR. O’MALLEY;

Ho, Your Honor, if I may backtrack a

bit, Your Honor, our basic position is that if it’s & tax and
we don’t think that the type c*f toll concerning the us© of a

9

road is a tax.

I think in your question you related to the

imposition of a toll, somehow or another really threatened
the existence of a Stats or of a governmental entity»

That

r

would raise separate issues, which we don't think are involved
ii this case.
QUESTION; Well, usually, tolls on toll roads are,
if not always, are dedicated and earmarked to amortize the bond
issue that, was the basis of building it.

You don't have, in

this case, I take it, any impounding of these
MR. O'MALLEY;

this use charge,

The revenue derived from this charge

daes go into a trust fund in the Treasury, and that money is
used to make grants to the Stutas for airport expansion and
davelopmfmt.

Now, the facilities are still owned by the

States, or their subdivisions, and the money is used, however,,
to further it.
The tax hex'©, though, is a tax on the use of the
navigable air space.

It is not specifically geared to a

particular use such as driving; over a toll road and paying a
one-time charge for it.
the line:

At some point these charges may

of distinction become fine ones.

But in this case

it has n&var been contested that this is not really a tax?
$

the only argument has been that it also has aspects of being ?.
uner fee,
QUESTION;

Well, the federal government has spent

hundreds of millions of dollars on river channels in order to

10
ip aka

rivor navigation feasible.
MR. O'MALLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

On your theory, could they charge

State-owned barges for carrying gas for the State?
MR. O'MALLEY;

I don't -Slink they could make a

direct tax of the States, because they happen to use, have
designated this particular revenue for river improvements„
However, if the, on a one-time basis, if -there's an agency that
has a particular expense and has a charge against, a boat for
tie particular use, -then it's clearly a user's fee, and it
doesn’t involve those sovereign issues, such as the levying on
finds of a State or exerting the power to ©van sais^ facilities
of a State, because they want to enforce tills revenue contri­
bution«
The different considerations —»
QUESTION:

Mr. O’Malley, wasn't it true that

.for

years State official business did not pay taxes- on their plane
tickets?
MR. O’MALLEY!

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And now they do.
MR. o'MALLEYs
QUESTIONs
MR»

What was the reason for that change?

O’MALLEY:

QUESTION:

Now they do, Your Honor, the —-

The-, legislative history --

Was that done by the Legislature?

MR. O’MALLEY:

The Legislature repealed the exemption

11
far the employees»

And I think the tax here is quite different,

b a cause at; least the users were oriented in tiafc c&s®, Your
Honor.
r

QUESTION:

X was just interested.

MR. O'MALLEY:

There are a number of exceptions

tiat are recognized in the immunity principle, so that there
is no question about the federal power to raise revenue being
unduly interfered with.

In other words, the States have to

b* engaging in a sovereign function, and they cannot immunize
contractors or the employees from incidental federal taxes*
These type of considerations have often been
recognized, but 'She factor that no other exceptions has ever
been recognized for taxes such as this where the government
claims that they have & particular use that they want to make
for this particular revenue.
Th<? sole argument that the government seems to make
is that this Court should analogize this tax with taxes that
are enacted from interstate carriers using State highways.
Wo consider the questions involved in an undue burden of inter­
state cos-aneroe issue quits different from the sovereignty
issues raised in the tax immunity argument.
f/

The interstate commerce burden question necessarily
involves a question ©f degree.
to be macie»

The relative judgments have

But in terms of th© constitutional principle

involving the status of the Statas under the Constitution,

12
questionis of degraa do not illuminata whether or not there is
actually an infringement in the constitutional sens®.
But even when reference is mad© to the user fee
argument, there are two aspects that the Commonwealth wishes
to raise,

First of all# this case was decided on a motion to

dismiss in the first instance,, whether or not theire has been

si approximate benefit relative to the amount of the tax would
rai.se thu factual question which probably would have to require
a hearing.
More importantly# we think the failure of th® user
fa® to even qualify as such ir, this case indicates that this
type of innovation is unworthy in the tax immunity area,
because oven though difficult taxable issues will be raised,
they do not illuminate the questions of sovereignty that are
involved her® that are not involved in cases whore you have an
\

interstate carrier claiming that their activities are being
unduly burdened„
QUESTION:

Mr. O'Malley, may 1 just —* just with

reage,rd to your first argument, is it your position that even
i~ it were a user fee in which the charge was related to th©
amount of usage of the air system that the State ■aircraft did
un®, that, it would still b© invalid?
MR. O'MALLEYs
a tax.

Yes, when they us© it in the form of

If there is another way to exact an, administrative

charge and it's based on a voluntary participation in &

13
particular program or the us© of a particular road, than —
QUESTION: Wall, if that’s your position, why don't,
you challenge — apparently the State has not challenged the.
tax on a:irline tichats by State smployaes.
MR.

O'MALLEY:

We have not, Your Honor.

Th©r® is

© question there whether or not the incidence of a tax is
actually on the Commonwealth or the St&fcs or on a particular
© nployee who then may or may not get reimbursed by the
government.

While there's that separate issue there, there is

ns question here but that the Internal Re vent®Agency in this
Ciss levied on funds of Idle Commonwealth quits directly.
QUESTION:

But surely som© of 'the Massachusetts

traveler?.; are reimbursed by tl a Stats.
MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, they are.

QUESTION: Are you suggesting that it was a d© minimis
thing?
MR. O’MALLEY:

No. Your Honor.

I think it's more

analogous to the casas where the salaries of government
employees that wars once considered immune from federal taxa­
tion, but that particular aspect of th© doctrine has since
baen discarded because — just because the State has to perhaps
make? up Ihe difference, in order to supply a wage and cover that
tax.
The connection between the State and the imposition
of the taxes was more remote and did not justify Uia protection

14
t iat they thought: the Constitution required.,
The formula, in this css© only involved weight.

Thera

is no formula which speaks of the amount of us© of the system
concerning the amount of the tax.

But even when you get

boyand the formula and you look to th© result, the user £s®
has not proved to b® a rough accommodation, approximation of
tie amount of use of th© system.
Th© Secretary of Transportation was required by
Congress in 'this Act to make a cost allocation study concerning
whether or not these charges were actually geared to, in any
way, th© use of the system.

The Secretary's findings are

clear that th© amount of the tax is not related to th© use of
th© system.
Now, this is a report filed by the federal official
charged with th© regulation of th® airways, and it should be
given considerable weight by this Court and should also b® an
indication that getting into this type of problem in &
sovereignty area is not & productive on©, because it in no
way illuminates what w© consider to be the basic question of
power raliher then th® question of degree.
Finally, th® United States really doesn't address the
failure of this particular tax to work out as a rough approxi­
mation of th© us© of th© system.

Rather, it make3 the

comparison teat the Commonwealth in this particular year
involved is due to receive $le5 million in grants for airport

15
expansion and development: and them compares it with the amount
of the taXc

We think this is clearly indicative) of why it

would not be appropriate to use the user fee issue in a tax
immunity area.
First of all, the amount awarded was pursuant to a
m itching grant program.

This is the type cf programs that arcs

o !ten used in federal-State areas, such as welfare and
education. They are programs of cooperative federalism,»
The United States dees not mention

* first of all,

they don't mention that this is a matching grant program? and,
second of all, they don’t mention the amount that Ids©
Commonwealth applied to programs of this nature.

If necessary,

the Commonwealth would prove that the Commonwealth supplied
$346,000 to meat the grants made by th® federal government.
Now, if this figure or degree of matching grant is
net satisfactory, then Congress would be free to change the
formula so that, the States had to supply money. But at least,
if would be dona on a voluntary cooperative federal-state
basis, ana it would not require the unilateral and potentially
coercive measures, such as the taxing measure in question her®,
And finally, in the case involving the use of th©
highways and their requirement to pay their way in interstate
commerce, the Court has always been satisfied that the highways
were.provided by the States and the States were really just
demanding compensation for the us© of the highways, and that

1C
the S-featea was really in a proprietary capacity for the most
part ia waking the charge*
In this case, the taxes on the use of the navigable
air space, the federal government does not own the air space,
and even when reference is made to the airport facilities,
tlev are still Steatee~bas@d facilities, that is, either owned
br the State or by their political subdivisions*

And in soma

cases those facilities may or may not receive federal funding*
This indicatas how we have difficulty in approxi­
mating the amount of use with the amount of the tax3 the
difficulty also added in this case is that we're note ©van
sura what th@ us© is being — the use of what facility is
being compensated for by levying a tax on the us© of this
navigable air space.
QUESTION:

Aren't the Air Controllers federal

employees?
MR* O'MALLEY:

MR* O'MALLEYs

Yes, Your Honor, generally they do

participate in. ih& program, but also to be noted, Your Honor,
ii that there are limitations as to what part of the facility
these funds are available for,,

For example, they don’t; give

msney for the use of terminal facilities, it’s mostly
directed towards the actual airport side of the facility*
QUESTION s

Who conducts the — whose communication

Between airport and aircraft»
As 1C understand it, the grants here

MR* O'MALLEYi

are mad© to the States to provide these facilities, Your Honor»
QUESTION:

<

But. th-sr© are federal funds, I think,

on th® communications.
MR» O'MALLEY:

Yes, there are federal funds involved

in. th© programs, and again they are matching funds to varying
extents under the statute.

MR, O’MALLEY:

Well, some of them — I don't think

I think soma of the facilities and the

equipment is provided by the grants of the nature involved
here.

But the States are involved in it.

MR. O'HALLEYs There may b® a subdivision of the

QUESTION: Does the record in this case contain any
information on that?
MR. O’MALLEY:

No, Your Honor, this was decided

strictly on the basis of the notion to dismiss, and the user
ffse rationale has actually evolved as this case has gone along,
rather than something that was clearly understood at the
beginning,
QUESTION:

You don't want to convince rm, do you,

that the State controls traffic from one side of this country
hi the other?
MRa O’MALLEY;

Certainly not, Your Honor.

It's

definitely manipulated by the federal government.

QUESTION:

Yes, fh© federal government doss.

it’s not the fedsr&l government it’s the Air Force.

And if

MRe O’MALLEY:

Oh.

The Air Fore®.

QUESTION: Ana if it’s not. the Air Force# it’s NASA.
It's everything as far away from State as you can get.
MR. O'MALLEY;

We*.xv talking about th@ commercial

Talking about all aviation.

It’s

MR. O'MALLEY:

In oi';@ form or another, yea. Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. O’Malley, it is true, though, isn't

it., that —- this is a helicopter involved in this case?
MR. O’MALLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

A helicopter could take off from the

roof of n hospital, say, fly around and land, never talk 'bo
anybody on the radio, never us® any federal facility at all,
Kid still have to pay the tax?
MR. O’MALLEY;

Certainly, Your Honor.

The tax is

a sales tax
QUESTION:

A salias tax, as if it had spent 100,000

hours in the air during the year, using all the facilities,
it would b® precisely the same tax, wouldn’t it?
MR. O’MALLEY:

It would be based solely on the

weight of the .aircraft and has nothing to cbwifh the use.
A helicopter by chance would us© these facilities less than as
airplane would, because of its maneuverability.

The costly

20

feature involved in making these grants is concerning the
terminal air space, feat, really controls fee —
QUESTION?

But a helicopter could take off .and land

without talking to any federal employee,, couldn’t, it?
MR» O'MALLEY?

It certainly could. Your Honor, and

vary often does»
QUESTION?

Is your submission limited to helicopters

MR» 0 * HALLEY s

I doii’t think this case should turn

on helicopters, it's strictly a State aircraft used for
public safety purposes, and if the aircraft did use the -if it w@::© an airplane, our argument would not differ, Your
Honor*
QUESTION s
mabiles?

So what are your arrangaments on auta-

Any of them subject to any tax?
MR» O'MALLEY?

The fuel tax, there is an exemption

in the: fuel tax for fe© State cruisers, but I don' t believe
tier© is any ©fear federal tar-: involved, and the State
doesn't tax its own property in that fashion.
Th© final point is that while most of th® discussion
of tax immunity is contained in older cases and perhaps
considered by many to b© just an old historical doctrine, we
believe feat th© Court's recent decision in*National teagu-a of
Cloose vy;» U;sary dramatically shows feat the concepts of a
Stats sovereignty feat are at fee very cor© of fe® complaint
raised in this case are still very much alive,

In feat css®

clause power, but I think the Court implicitly, if not
explicitly, recognised the continuing vitality of this
constitutional principle and was clear t© state that they
ware not going to resolve a case on a particularized assessment

The particular federal statute was declared uncon­
stitutional because it was found to infringe upon the essential
role of the States in our union, end we think this case

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. RYAN# JR®, ESQ.#

MR. RYAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas© th©

aid Airway U;i©r Charges®

which make air travel safes services such as Air Traffic

That was the rationale

of the Court ©f Appeals? and we think this Court can affirm on

However? if th© Court feels it necessary or desirably

to face that question? we think that it need go no furrier
tian to reaffirm the case of New York vs. united States? and
wb

believe that an affirmance on that ground would still

result in an affirmance of the judgment of the Court cf
Appeals? it would still uphold the tax.
Thin case of New York vs. United Statas» .as this
Court is ©fers, was decided without a majority of the Court, &&

ti© opinion of th© Court.

Sfc&ts’s performance ©f its sovereign functions of government.a
And Chief Jus tic® Stone, it should ba added, voted

to sustain th© tax, and the tax was sustained,,
As I understand the Commonwealth * a case, they are
@3sentially relying on this statement by Mr. Chief Justice
Stone. But. there is no evidence in this case, nor is there
aiy claim as to what that evidence might be, as to how this
tax unduly interfere with Massachusetts1 performans® of its
s 3V85resign function.

We think th© reason for that is that, it

does not interfere at all.
Massachusetts, in its complaint, which is taken as
true for present purposes, simply made no allegation, nor do
I understand the Commonwealth to make any allegation in their
brief now that this tax interferes with the performance of
tte.tr sovereign duties.
