Bixby, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. BIXBY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

ML. BIXBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Cour t:
This case is here on certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

A divided panel of

that court .affirmed a final administrative decision of the
Board of Immigration Appeals finding that the petitioner in
this case is

an alien and that he is deportable from the United

States.
The petitioner claims to be a citizen of the United
States and that he was born here in 1924.

When he was two and

a half years of age, his mother sent him to Italy to live with
her sister end brother-in-law.
QUESTION:

They later —

These facts axe somewhat in dispute,

are

they not, that you are —
MR.

BIXBY:

They are in dispute.

This is the

petitioner's version of the facts, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

His versions,

versions of the facts?

is there some variety in his

4
MR. BIXBY;

There is some inconsistency here in the

record, Your Honor, yes, there is.

The administrative hearings

were held over the course of several years in time and. as far
as dates are concerned, there are inconsistent dates as to
when he claims birth in the United States, and so on.
QUESTION:
called them,

Are there inconsistencies, as you have

ii terms of what kind of documents were submitted

by the petitioner?
MU. BIXBY:

Yes.

The only document that was sub”

mit.ted by the petitioner consisted of a birth certificate,
Ycur Honor.

This was a birth certificate that showed the pe­

titioner to be born in the year 1921.

We take the position,

because of evidence that was — testimony that was later
adduced in the administrative hearings, and because of certain
developments that the petitioner was not in fact born in the
year 1921, that the birth certificate is not a birth certifi­
cate than relates to the petitioner's birth, that in fact the
petitioner was born in the year 1924.
QUESTION:

How did the -- I hs.ve some recollection

of the Hearing Examiner characterised this document as fraudu­
lent or some;thing of that, in that way, is that correct?
ME. BIXBY:

I don't think that is correct, Your Honor.

I don't recall —
QUESTION:
MU. BIXBY:

— or some such thing?
I don't recall anything in the record as

5
far as the hearing — the immigration judge, the hearing of­
ficer in the administrative proceeding saying that the document
was fraudulent.

He did find that the document did not belong

co the petitioner, did not reflect the petitioner’s birth.
QUESTION:

He presented a birth certificate that

belonged to somebody else?
MR. BIXBY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
I suppose that is where the illusion —

the pejorative terra came somewhere in the record?
MR. BIXBY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe so.

The pe­

titioner contends -— well, the petitioner's evidence attempts
to establish that he lived in Italy until the year 1951 and
that he then returned to the United States.

The sister and

brother-in-lat o£ the petitioner's mother affiliated him in
Italy.

He lived with them until his return here in the year

of 1951.
His primary proof in the administrative proceedings
as far as birth in the United States is concerned consisted of
the testimony of these two people who he lived with and who
affiliated him in Italy and the testimony of his half-brother
who was born and lives here in the United States.
Tie government’s case rests on documents chat were
submitted in the administrative proceedings that purport to
show that the petitioner was born in Italy in the year 1927.
Ae far as the testimony of the petitioner's witnesses

was concerned, the Immigration judge that conducted the depor­
tation hearings rejected this testimony as being non-credible.
He found that the petitioner was born in Italy and that he was
an alien deportable and ordered that he be deported to Italy.
The Board of Immigration Appeals deferred to the
Immigration judge on the question of credibility and affirmed
his decision.

In the board's decision, there is a statement

which is a very important statement, I think, and that is that
if believed,

the petitioner's witnesses, the testimony of

petitioner'.m witnesses clearly refutes the otherwise strong
documentary case made by the government as to alienage.
The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals was
taken by petition for review by the ninth Circuit.

In the pe­

tition for review, the ninth Circuit was requested to transfer
the proceedings under section IOC (a) (5) of the Immigration and
nationality Act to a district court for a hearing de novo on
the questior. of citizenship.

The ninth Circuit declined to do

this on the ground that the petitioner had not presented a
colorful clcim to U.S. citizenship in its administrative pro­
ceedings „
How, the question as presented by this case is a
question that has not yet, has never heretofore been considered
by this Court, and that is the proper interpretation of section
106(a)(5) of the Immigration and nationality Act.

This is part

of a large section, section 106, that was enacted in loci that

7
i;

a substantial revision of the procedures for obtaining

judicial review of a final adminitrative order of deportation.
The key feature of section 106 is to eliminate dis­
trict courts from the judicial review of deportation orders
and to require that an alien go directly into a court of
appeals,, file a petition for review, and the court of appeals
has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of a
final order of deportation on the administrative record.
Or.e exception, of course, to that is the section that
is involved in this case, and that is 106(a)(5) which provides
that where e person has presented a claim for citizenship and
that claim is not a frivolous claim, and there is a genuine
issue of material fact, the court of appeals must transfer the

proceedings tc the U.S. District Court for the residence of
the petitioner and a trial de novo is had in that District
Court to determine the question of citizenshin.

This exception

is necessary because of this Court's decisions going back to
Mg Fung Ho v. White, where it was held that any resident of the
United States who claims to foe a citizen has a constitutional
right to a judicial trial on that claim if his evidence pre­
sented in the administrative proceedings is sufficient, if
believed, to support a finding of citizenship.
The initial question in this casa I think is whether
Congress intended to change the evidentiary standard when it
enacted section 106(a)(5).

The case law prior to 1961 had been

3

that a substantial — the test for obtaining judicial determin­
ation of citizenship was the substantial evidence test.

Now,

there is no legislative history one way or the other on the
subject of whether Congress intended to make any change in the
burden of proof, but the fact that the Congress did employ
summary judgment language in 105(a)(5) strongly suggests I
think that

:hey did intend to relax the burden of proof, that

something Icjss than substantial evidence was intended to be
required to obtain judicial determination of nationality.
QUESTION:

?lr. Bixbv, you think that the word

’frivolous" is an additional qualification to a genuine issue
of material fact?
HR. BIXBY:

I am not sure that it is.

I think that

if there is a genuine issue of material fact, it is quite hard
to perceive of any situation where there would be a frivolous
claim and also a genuine --- I mean, if it is a genuine issue
of material fact, to me it can’t be a frivolous claim.

I think

it is really redundant and I don't think —
QUESTION:

By contrast, if it is frivolous, there is

no genuine issue of material fact, is that true?
HR. BIXBY:
QUESTION:

I think that would hold true, Your Honor.
What relief are you asking for here, simply

that this be heard by the district court?
MR. BIXBY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that is all.
Nothing else?

9
MR. BIX BY:

Nothing else, Your Honor.

No.

In the

administrative proceedings, there were various forms of dis­
cretionary relief from deportation that were applied for in
the alternative without, of course, waiving our claim to
citizenship, and these forms of relief were not granted but I
don't believe whey are at issue here because we did not argue
in our briefs before the Ninth Circuit, we didn't make these
points in the briefs and we solely confined the briefs to the
transfer issue.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

found that where was no colorable claim to citizenship.

Bo you

view that as the equivalent of holding that the claim -was
frivolous?
Mi:. BIXBY:

I think the Court of Appeals for the

Ninth Circuit, and especially — well, I say that for several
reasons — the court cited a case that was decided, prior to
1961, a case that dealt with — actually it was a case that
only contained, dictum —
QUESTION:
MR. BIXBY:
correct, anc

Kessler v. —
— Kessler v. Streeker, Your Honor,

that was a case that did in dictum mention the

substantial evidence rule.

And I think the Court of Appeals,

the majority of the Court of Appeals found that the petitioner
ha3 not satisfied the substantial evidence rule.
QUESTION:

It didn't quite say that, though, did it?

10
MR. BIX BY i

Well,. I don3t think it quite said that.

I think the dissent points out aside from that —• wall, the
dissent points out that the correct function of the Court of
Appeals is not to determine credibility, not to act as a fact­
finder, and I think that is what the majority of the Court of
Appeals did in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing that there were a birth

certificate showing that the person claiming to be a national
was in fact born in a town in Italy and the claimant did not
contest the birth certificate nor offer any explanation as to
why it was not a perfectly valid document, I take it your
client hare does make some contest to that.

But supposing

that he didn't, and it was simply a question of this document
versus the claimant's sworn statement that he was born in the

United States, now would that be a non-frivolous claim?
MI.. BIXBY:

No, I think that would be a frivolous

claim because I think the case that you put is really a bare
assertion of citizenship without any evidentiary support at all.
QUESTION:

In other words, just a statement, even

though made just from knowledge —
MI.» BIXBY:
QUESTION:

Under oath.,
—• will not overcame an unchallenged docu­

ment?
MI. BIXBY:

That's correct.

I don't think a person

that merely asserts citizenship and has no evidence to support

11
it is entitled to a transfer of proceedings under this statute,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

How do you suppose the Court of Appeals

came to think that the decisive question here was whether or
not there was a colorable claim to United States nationality?
The majority found there wasn't and the dissenting judge
thought that there was a colorable claim, and that phrase is
ncwhere to be found in the statute, is it?
MR. 3IXBY:
QUESTION:

No, it isn't, Your Honor.
Do you suppose that they thought the issue

was whether or not it was frivolous or whether or not there was
a genuine issue of material fact, because those are the two
statutory tests?
MR. BIXBY:
impossible

That's correct.

I think again, and it is

;o say for certain because it is a very brief de­

cision —
QUESTION:

But each of them acts as — both the court

and the dissent speak as though the issue were whether or not
there was a colorable claim and that particular test is nowhere
in the statute, is it?
MR. BIXBYs
QUESTION:

That’s true.
The only two statutory tests is whether or

not it is frivolous and whether or not there is a genuine issue
of material fact.

To which issue do you suppose the Court of

Appeals was directing its attention, or to both?

12
MR. SIXBY:

Well, again, I am not certain that these

are two separate requirements.

I think that really there is a

redundancy here, that frivolous and genuine issue of material
fact, if it is a non-fr ivolous claim, I think that there is a
genuine issue of material fact, and vice versa.
QUESTION:

And so you think colorable claim is a

suitable synonym for both of the statutory phrases?
MIR BIX BY:

Probably it wouldn’t have been the phrase

that I would have used, but I think that the majority — well,
the majority and the dissent, as you point out, both use that
phrase and 1' think they must have thought that it was -QUESTION:

But the majority cited the Kessler case,

which used the -MR. BIX BY:
QUESTION:

Substantial evidence.
-- substantial evidence under the old

statute.

0

MR. BIX BY:

And it did say it also, the short majority

opinion went, on in the last sentence saying that it also did
not, the evidence does not meet the standard set forth in
Kessler v. Strecker.
QUESTION:
MR. BIXBY:

As though it ware an additional ■—
As though it were an additional require­

ment of the statute, right.
I believe that the case -- well, to begin with, I
should say, as the Court realizes I am sure, there are merely a

13

handful of decisions from the Court of Appeals; reported de­
cisions that have construed section 106(a)(5), and in looking
at these decisions I think that the case of Pignatello v.
Attorney General is the only decision that really deals in any
depth with ::he statute.

Now, in that case, the Court viewed

the statute as being essentially a summary judgment statute and
it did state that as far as the standard that raust be satisfied,
that the statute only requires a modicum of substantiality to
the claim of citizenship, and that the claim not be a frivolous
one.
The Court obviously, although it didn’t expressly
state this, it obviously felt that there: was some change in
the evidentiary standard from substantial evidence over to a
modicum of: substantiality, and 1 would suppose that the fact
that the statute employs the summary judgment language as the
basis for the Second Circuit 5s conclusion that only a modicum
of substantiality is required.
The case of Pitnatello also points out that the
function of the Court of Appeals is not to determine credibility
of evidence,- and it is not to sift and to weigh the evidence,
that that if the function of the District Court.

If the pro­

ceedings are. transferred to the District Court,, the District
Court acting as the tier of fact —
QUESTION:

In the first instance, it is the function

of the hearing examiner, is it not?

14

MR. BIXBY:

If there is — well, in the first in­

stance, you. are correct, Your Honor, administratively it is the
hearing examiner who makes this decision initially and then the
Board of Immigration Appeals, the final administrative authority
on thi s -—
QUESTION:

And what you say is the hearing examiner

concluded about the -MR. BIXBY:

He decided, Your Honor, that che testi­

mony of the petitioner's witnesses in this case was not credible.
He did not accept their testimony as being truthful and there­
fore he rejected the testimony -QUESTION:
MR. BIXBY:

This is why you wanted a de novo hearing?
This is exactly it.

We feel that we are

entitled to a judicial determination and. we feel that this case
rned on the issue of credibility.

And where that is the case,

the --QUESTION:

Must the District Court try every such case

of deportation ultimately if credibility ic a,;, issue?
fir.. BIXBY:
only this

Cc.se.

Not at all, Your Honor.

It is limited to

Not only does the Constitution require in a

case where a person claims citizenship that the District Court
where there is, as we say, a modicum of substantiality, as the
Court ii Picnatello says, a modicum of substantiality of the
claim, it is for the District Court to judicially determine
that claim.

But in no other case involving deportation, Your

15
Honor, would doe District Court be involved at all.

Section

106 makes it very clear that courts of appeals determine the
validity of final orders of deportation on the administrative
record in all cases except for cases where there is a claim to
citizenship..
QUESTION:

But you would say, I take it, that admin­

istrative resolutions of credibility in cases like this, where
there is a claim of citizenship, if you believe the person, if
you believe the fellow is a citizen, and if you disbelieve him,

he isn’t — you take it that those situations would always have
to go to the District Court?
MI:. BIXBYs

Always, Your Honor, I think so because

uhere is a credibility issue and that was what this section was

designed to — well, it was designed to codify actually the
constitutional right, the Fifth Amendment due process right.
QUESTION:

And you confine that to cases where the

issue is citizenship or non-citizenship?
Mb. BIXBY:
QUESTION:

Exactly correct, Your Honor, yes.
May I give you an example of the point

that Mr. Justice White just put to you?

Let’s assume in this

case that you had documentary records such as those that were
presented that showed on their face that, the plaintiff was born
Italy, was married in Italy, assume further there were no
other documentary records of any kind and the only other evi­
dence was the plaintiff took the stand and said those documents

16
are false.

Well, I will add one other set of facts to it.

You

had an individual who had a long criminal record, as this in­
dividual had.

Does all one have to do is to stand up and swear

that he is an American citizen without presenting any supporting
evidence of any kind except his own statement?
MR. 3IXBY:

Well, I think you have to present more

than your own statement.

I believe that there would have to be

mere evidence than that certainly.
QUESTION:

Well, what if he not only made the bald

assertion which you before said wasn't enough, what if he said
I was born on such and such a date in Detroit, Michigan, and. my
parents were so and so, and he attempted to support his claim
to citizenship by some facts?
he did here,

If he called somebody else, like

and they said, yes, we have known this man all our

life and he was born in Detroit, Michigan, we knew him as a
child and he was here, you would say at least in that lattercase it would require a retrial in the District Court?
MR. BIXBY;
would have

Well, I think in the latter case you

■
QUESTION:

Well, what about the former where he just

himself attempts to support his claim with his own assertions?
MR. BIXBYs

I don’t think there would be a modicum of

suostantiaij.ty to the claim in the former case.
QUESTION:

Yet under the summary judgment rule, the

it ierested party himself by denying or asserting can survive a

17
motion for suramary judgment, so if you concede that you admit
that this i:;n t the same as a. summary judgment rule?
MR. BIXBY:

I think this is essentially a suramary

judgment statute, and I think the Couz'ts of Appeals that have
dealt with this statute treated it as such.
QUESTION:

But then your answer to Justice White's

question should be that it only should take the statement of
your client under oath that "I am a citizen of the United
States, born in Detroit," without any supporting witness at all,
because that is the uniformly applied summary judgment test, as
I understand it.
MR. BIXBY:

Well, all I can say on that, certainly if

that is the test, if it truly were a summary judgment statute,
than perhaps that is so.
QUESTION:

Well, I am questioning you, you know, I am

not purporting to give an answer.
MR. BIXBY:

I think that the cases that have been de-

aided by the Courts of Appeals have not viewed the statute as
strictly summary judgment, that is they have required that
there be something more than a sworn statement by the petitioner
to the effect that "I am a U.S. citizen."
QUESTION:

So you think that there can be an adminis­

trative determination of the alien or the supposed alien's own
credibility', but there can't be administrative rejection of the
credibility of any witnesses he calls, if he would win, if their

IS
testimony was believe!?
MR. BIXBY;

Well, I think that there has — again, I

suppose I am coming back to this modicum of substantiality.

I

think there has to be something more than -\

QUESTION;

I guess you say at least if he calls some

other witnesses and they present some testimony, you are en­
titled to a trial in the District Court?
MR. BIXBY;

Well, I think it would probably be *— you

would have to look at the testimony of the witnesses that he
called, as to what they would testify to.

Their testimony might

be worthless or it might —
QUESTION:
MR. BIXBY;

At least that isn't your case?
That isn’t ray case.

I think the closest

case to that is the Rassano case, which i.s cited in the brief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bixby,

'hat do you do with these three

alleged convictions?
ML. BIXBY:

I don’t think they have any bearing on

whether the man is a citizen of tire United States or not.
QUESTION;

But they might have a bearing on his

credibility though, because all the convictions were for fraud
or something that •—

Yes, Your Honor.
But you don't feel any obligation to ex­

plain at all?
MR. BIXBY:

I don't feel any obligation to explain

I am not —
QUESTION:

Maybe that explains why the court did not

accept the
MR. BIXBY;

Well, I am relying more on the testimony

of the witnesses called by the petitioner than I am on the pe­
titioner rs testimony, for that matter.
QUESTION:

The witnesses were -—

they were not credible?
ME. BIXBY:
a position, though,

That's correct, Your Honor.
the Pianettis,

They ware in

who were the couple in Italy

that were affiliated with the petitioner, where he lived, they
were in the best position to know the facts as far as his birth,
of course.

He was only two and a half years of age when he was

sent to Italy.

He wouldn't know these things, but they would

and they were in the best position to know and so I am relying
more on their testimony than I would upon the petitioner*s
bestimony.
QUESTION:

And you think you are entitled to have a

district judge, nothing less than a district judge make the
evaluation of the credibility of the
MR. BIXBY;

witnesses —

I think we are entitled to a trial de novo

QUESTION;
MR. BIX BY:

By a district judge?
—by a district judge who would: observe

the demeanor of the witnesses and who would determine the
credibility.
QUESTION:

That doesn't give much utility to the func­

tion of the hearing examiner, dees it?
MR. BIXBY:

In a particular case where U.S„ citizen­

ship is involved, Your Honor, ic doesn’t leave the hearing of­
ficer as the final authority.
QUESTION:

But can you imagine any case where the

claim of citizenship could not ba made?
MI.. BIXBY:

I think it must be very rarely made, Your

Honor, considering the fact that there is only a handful of
cases since 1961 that have been decided.
QUESTION:

My question was can you imagine a case

where it could not ba made?
MI;. BIXBY:

Oh, I suppose it could be made in any

.use that came before the Immigration authorities, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Up to now it has been apparently thought

that the determination of the hearing examiner was sufficient.

Not at all, Your Honor, net by the Courts

Mr. Bixby, just so I have it clearly

of events is that of the witnesses, the two Pianettis, his
adaptive parents -MR. BIXBY:

MR. BIXBY:

-- and his half-brother, Carmen Ripolino.
That’s correct, Your Honor.
And then his own testimony.

Now, is there

any documentary testimony whatsoever that corroborate any portion

22

of their testimony?
MR. BIXBY:

In the administrative record, there is no

document to corroborate this testimony, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Your claim, as I understand it, is that if

we were to believe the testimony — I mean if the trier of fact
were to believe the testimony of those three persons, they would
establish c itizenship?
MR. BIX BY s

Yes, that was the conclusion, Your Honor,

of the Board of Immigration Appeals.
QUESTION:
MR. BIXBY:
QUESTION:
al intent.

They said the same thing?
Yes.
May I ask you a question about congression­

I realize, of course, you are relying on the words

of the statute, but here we have a case in which the Immigra­
tion judge found ----- and I am reading from the record -- that
-he claim to citizenship here has been knowingly false from its
inception, knowingly false all the way down the road.

He has

hcii two or three hearings before an Immigration judge and a
couple before the board.

The board affirms that conclusion of

totally false testimony all the way.

The Court of Appeals re­

viewed it and concluded that there was no colorable claim to
citizenship, and now you are asking us to start all over again
at the level of the District Court and then cane back up to
the Court oi Appeals presumably.

Do you think Congress could

have intended a regime of litigation of that character?

23
MR. BIXBYs

I think the Congress intended the words

of 106(a)(5) -- they make it quite clear that Congress intended
that when a case, when it is citizenship, U.S. citizenship
that is involved, and the administrative findings, findings by
the hearing officer and Board of Immigration Appeals turn on
the issue of credibility, that certainly that man is entitled
tc —
QUESTION:

It didn't use the word "credibility."

It

spoke of a frivolous claim.
MR. BIXBYs

Well, I think it is quite clear that the

3card of Immigration Appeals felt

-.hat the determination on the

issue of citizenship was one that turned, on the issue of credi­
bility.

They defer to the Immigration judge as the tier of

fact as far as the issue of credibility is concern©!.

So I

think that the statute was certainly designed to give the in­
dividual who claims to be a citizen aud who has presented a
mcdicum anyway of substantiality to his claim, to give him that
right to have a judicial determination made.

That, of course,

has been decided by this Court, that that is a constitutional
right, but that is going back to Mg Fung Ho v. White.
QUESTION:

Just offhand I cant recall any other

system of review in the federal system quite comparable to the
position you are taking.

I recognize that you have a statute

with special, language, and I would make that argument that you
argue.

I an just wondering whether Congress conceivably could

24
have had any such intention.
MR. BIXBY 2

I think they had to have an intention,

Your Honor, because the man has a constitutional right and.
they had to make an exception in this section, section 106, and
give him that constitutional right of a judicial trial of the
issue of citizenship if he presented the — if he does present
ir his administrative hearing evidence that at least bad a
modicum of substantiality.
QUESTION:

And if this is a unique procedure, it is

because of deportation as a unique process, i.e. , is a monstrous­
ly unconstitutional thing to forcibly deport a citizen to some
foreign lane..
MR. BIXBY:

I think that is correct, Your Honor.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Jetton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARION L. JETTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TH.E RESPONDENT
MRS. JETTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Ti.a petitioner:'.is seeking a; hr - ling de novo in the

United States District Court of his claim that he is a United
Sfates citizer by virtue of his birth in the United States.
We contend that petitioner's claim of citizenship is frivolous
and that he has not raised a genuine issue of material fact
concerning his claim of U.S. citizenship,, therefore the Court

of Appeals properly held petitioner deportable on the basis of
the administrative record before it, without referring the
proceedings to the District Court for a hearing.
Section 106(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act, which petitioner asserts requires de novo trial in his
case, is part of a general revision of provisions for judicial
review of deportation orders.
ir 1961 was,

This revision which was enacted

as petitioner’s counsel has noted, intended to

prevent repetitious litigation of deportation order cases.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Jetton, it would help me if you went

a little •— if you raised your voice a little bit and went a
little slower.
MRS. JETTON:

The revision prevented this repetitious

litigation by eliminating District Court review in most cases.
Indeed, the Court of Appeals generally review deportation
order cases on the administrative record.
Section 106(a)(5) is a narrow exception to this
scheme.

It provides a de novo hearing in the District Court

when a person subject to final deportation order makes a sub­
stantial claim of citizenship.

But in keeping with the general

purposes of section 106(a)(5), not every claim of United States
citizenship need be referred to the District Court for trial.
Instead, th«

section requires the person requesting transfer to

make a show: :k that his claim is not frivolous and to show that
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to that person's

26
nationality.
Only if these two showings are made must the; Court of
Appeals -transfer the case to the District Court.
QUESTION:

I was just going to ask if you would state

your view as to what the difference is between frivolous and
the existence or absence of a material issue of fact.
MRS. JETTON:

The statute isn’t entirely clear as to

whether those are two different standards.

In part, they use

the term genuine issue of material fact to distinguish those
ncn-frivolous cases where there is an issue of fact from those
ncn-frivolous cases where there is an issue of law.

Those

cases where there is an issue of law that is non-frivolous can
be determined by the Court of Appeals under the statute, and
.non-frivolous

cases

where there is an issue of fact, a genuine

issue of material fact, are intended to be referred to the
District Court.

The frivolous claim can be disposed of by the

Court of Appeals under the language of the statute merely by
the holding that the claim is frivolous.
QUESTION:

Like they did here?

MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

They appear to have done here, yes.

But they can do that on a factual issue as

well as an issue of law?
MRS. JETTON:

Yes, the way the statute is written a

frivolous claim issue of law can lie disposed of under the
frivolous standard as well.

27
QUESTION:

Another puzzling; aspect of this statute to

me — and perhaps you can answer it — it refers to the plead­
ings and affidavits filed by the parties, are we limited to
those in reviewing the record in this case?
MRS. JETTON:

In thirr case, the pleadings incorporat*

ed the entire administrative record.
QUESTION:

,

Including all of the testimony of witnesses?

MRS. JETTON:

Yes, that was all before the Court of

Appeals and was referred to in the pleadings.

Presumably that

was intended to be picked up by the term "pleadings."
as you note

Again,

the statute isn’t entirely clear, but that had to

be, I would assume was the intention of the Congress.
QUESTION:

And there is no issue in the case on that

point?
MRS. JETTON:

Nc —■ excuse me, Your Honor, there is

an issue in the case as to what record, what part of the record
fha Court of Appeals was permitted to look to in passing on
whether there was a genuine issue of material fact.

Petitioner

contends that the Court of Appeals was not permitted to go
beyond reading the opinion of the Board of Immigration
Examiners, and we contend that the plain, language of the statute
permits the Court of Appeals to look at the pleadings including
the administrative record incorporated in the pleadings as well
as any affidavits that cure provided to the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

And we are to read it all without any help

28
from the Court of Appeals?

Is there any way we can do it with­

out reading all of it?
MRS. JETTONs

There are fairly good summaries in the

various opinions of the Immigration judge.
QUESTION;

Well, would we be doing our job if we did'?
*

MRS. JETTONs

Those are merely a starting point, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

And we would have to read the whole thing

because Congress meant to dump it all here?

Do you think

Congress meant that?
MRS. JETTONs

I believe that Congress intended that

these cases which are factual cases would normally end up here,
yes.
QUESTION:
other than

What evidence did the government put in

what?

MRS. JETTONs

The service presented a comprehensive

documentary case in the administrative hearings.

These began

with records, of birth of petitioner, three separate independently
created recorded records showing his birth in Italy in 1927, as
a. foundling he was recorded under the name Vincenzo Di Paola.
QUESTIONs

Your live testimony was —

MFS. JETTON;

t£3timonv, to

The government did not present any live

recollection.

QUESTIONS

Well, the defendant did?

MRS. JETTON:

Yes, the defendant did,

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals just brushed that

aside? the sworn testimony?
MRS, JETTON:

The Court of Appeals had the entire

record before it and —
QUESTION:

Wei1, the Court of Appeals failed to men-

tion anything about it?
MRS, JETTON:

That's correct, Your Honor, the Court

of Appeals merely stated in conclusory terms that there had
been no
QUESTION;

So the Court of Appeals had. the choice of

sending this to be decided on its facts to the District Court
or to us, so they sent it to us?
QUESTION:

[Laughter]

I understand now.

Mrs, Jetton, before you get back into your

argument, i:: we disregard the petitioner's own testimony
entirely, because he was impeached repeatedly, and if we
merely assume for purposes of decision that it is at least
theoretically possible that the trier of fact might believe
the Pianett.is who, as I understand it, were the couple that
adopted him or affiliated him, according to his version, and
the testimony of his brother-in-law.

Would you agree that if

that testimony were believed, that he made a non-frivolous
claim of citizenship?
MRS, JETTON:

Our contention is that the Pianettis'

testimony and that of his brot ier~in-law cannot be read in
isolation, that when their testimony is read against the rest

30
of the record , including petitioner’s own testimony on a variety
of occasions, that the result is that the Pianettis have not -QUESTIONs

Have not told the truth?

And ray question

is if we assume that the tier of fact thought they told the
truth, and you accepted that for the purposes of ray question,
would you then agree that he has made a non-frivolous claim of
citizenship'5
MIS,, JETTON:

Assuming that what the Pianettis had

said was true, which is that the documents which the service
has provided

in the record —-

QUESTION:

Were prepared by his grandfather in order

to hide the fact that he was illegitimate —•
MRS. JETTON:
QIESTION:

— were entirely falsified

— and so forth.

MRS. JETTON:

If that is the case, then — and if

none of the previous testimony that was in the record was dis­
regarded, then petitioner probably, that would have been the
absolute minimum showing to get to the District Court.

However .

the -QUESTION:

That is not quite my question.

My question

— and I will try to state it very simply — is if one were to
believe the Pianettis and Carmen Ripolino, that everything they
said was true, would their testimony make out a non-frivolous
claim of citizenship on behalf of the petitioner?
MRS. JETTON:

I think that is the case.

If —

QUESTION:

So in order

.0' find his claim frivolous,

we must disbelieve these three witnesses?
MRS. JETTON;

That is our contention, or disbelieve

the Pianettis -QUESTION:

As a matter of law, they all three -- it

can be demonstrated as a matter of law that all three of them
fabricated their testimony?
tf

MRS. JETTON;

Yes.

Our contention is that at least

the Pianettis' testimony was fabricated and the purported halfbrother's testimony was not, did not prove that the petitioner
was a citizen.
QUESTION:

It is also your position that that is

properly determined by the administrative agency and by the
Court of Appeals?
MRS. JETTON:

Yes, our position is that on this

record —
QUESTION:

That determination doesn't have to be made

in the District Court?
MRS. JETTON:

Yes, on this record, that the Court of

Appeals could properly dispose of the case.
As petitioner agrees, the showing
QUESTION:

Can you tell me what kind of record that

would not be so in the face of the statute?
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

I sra sorry?

You say on this record the Court of Appeals

32
coaid propei:ly dispose of the case.

Can you illustrate for me

the kind of record where that would not be so, where the oppo­
site would be true?
MI'S. JETTON:

Probably if the only evidence in this

case was on one side the Immigration Service's documentary
record and on the other side was the Pianettis* testimony.

If

the Pianettis had testified in 1967. at the beginning of the
trial and held said that those documents are falsified, we know
from family history that these documents were falsified, if
that was the only evidence in the case, that would be an abso­
lute minima]- showing that would permit transfer to the District
Court.

Our contention is that the Pianettis’ testimony came

only after four years of hearings, and the content of the
testimony provided by petitioner in those four years of hear­
ings cast such doubt on the credibility of the Pianettis that
(

on= can onlj conclude that the Pianettis' testimony was not —
either they didn't know the story or they were not telling the
truth.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the theory you argue to the

District Court?
MORS. JETTON:

Our contention is that following the

summary judgment standard, that there are some cases that it
is not — that where a claim has been made that is so incredible
that it cannot be accepted by reasonable minds, and that there
is no need to transfer that type of case to the District Court

33
fcr the District Court to merely enter summary judgment.
QUESTIONi

Well, you had a split opinion below, so

there was seme reasonable — there was one reasonable mind that
thought otherwise.
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

The question —

Why isn't the government's position just

plain and simple -—maybe it is, but you haven't said so yet -that the adninistrative agency is entitled to make credibility
determinations, and if affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that
is the end of it?
MRS. JETTON:

The cases on summary judgment indicate

that a genuine issue of credibility is properly not dealt with
0

by summary judgment, so our contention is necessarily that in
this case the Pianeitis —
QUESTION:

There is just no genuine issue of credi-

bility?
MRS. JETTON:

There is no issue of credibility and I

will
QUESTION:

Their credibility may be determined in this

case anyway, although you admit that if you believed everything
they said, there would be a genuine issue of fact?
MRS. JETTON:

And if there had been no previous testi­

mony to cast doubt on their story.
QUESTION:
that they said —

Well, again, if you just believe everything

34
MRS, JETTON:

Yes, you would have to disregard the

previous testimony is our position in order to believe every­
thing they said.
QUESTION:

During the first four years he was liti­

gating this, what was the theory of his case for non-deporta­
tion?
MRS. JETTON:

He initially claimed that he was Joseph

Agostc, born in Cleveland in 1921, and the sole basis for this
belief was r. birth certificate which he subsequently admits
belonged to an entirely different person and was not his own.
QUESTION:

So he presented someone else!s birth cer­

tificate to prove his American citizenship during the first
four years of his —
MRS.

JETTON:

He presented — and in addition he pre­

sented that certificate to get into the United States and to get
a Jnited Statos passport.
I would like to go over to some extent the reasons
that we don't think the Pianettis" testimony can be viewed in
isolation, as petitioner would have you do, and why when taken
together with the rest of the record we believe that it is
clear that their testimony was a fabrication, just as all of
petitioner'a earlier versions of which —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Jetton, you don't say at just any

tine the .administrative agency may make final determinations of
credibility, don't need to go to the District Court, it is just

35
that if it is really incredible?
MRS, JETTON:

Yes,

Our contention is, among others,

that the administrative agency, if you read the entire opinion,
did not say that this case was turning on an issue of the de­
meanor of the Pianettis,

The administrative agency had a number

of other reasons for determining that the story was a fabrica­
tion,

It relied in part on the number of times the Agosto

story had changed, it relied on the past documentary record
that —
QUESTION:

So the agency may determine that the wit-

ness is lying in certain circumstances?

When it is clear

enough that he is lying, they can say he is lying, and refuse
to credit his testimony?
MRS, JETTON:

Yes,

Our contention is that the Court

of Appeals l.as to look at the whole matter itself.

They can't

*

jest take the statement by the Immigration Board, and in this
case the Court of Appeals could, setting aside the discussion
about the demeanor of the Pianettis, on a number of other
grounds conclude that the Pianettis" statements were fabrica­
tions.
The conflicts between the Pianettis9 testimony and
petitioner’s; earlier testimony are not reconcilable, and yet
thare is no explanation in the record for why petitioner’s
earlier statements were incorrect.

On a number of the subjects,

thay were topics that had to be within petitioner’s own

36
recollection.

For example/ the year he started school»- as a

child of: six or severi» he does not claim that he couldn't count
beck from the year he graduated from school to find out when he
started.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, on that point, Mrs. Jetton»

that was over in Italy, wasn't it?
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Does the government disagree with the fact

that ha was raised by the Pianettis?
MRS. JETTON;

No, we quite agree.

In fact, the

government's case shows that he was taken from a foundling home
at the age of a month by Mrs. Pianetti.
who he. lived with as a boy.

There is a question of

He testified to one thing, that at

the ace of 9, up to the age of 9 he lived with his grandfather
and then went to live with the Pianettis.

The Pianettis took

the stand aid testified that he went to live with them immedi­
ately.

Now, ei nine-year-old boy would know who he had lived

with.
There is a considerable discrepancy as to the year
that he was told that he was illegitimate.

One version was

that he was 17; another is that he wasn't told until 1948 or
"49, four or five years later.

Surely, an event of such moment

as the time you are told that you are illegitimate and were
born in the United States and not in Italy as you previously
thought, would be indelibly marked on someone's mind.

37
QUESTION:

Well,. Mrs. .Jetton, supposing that you had

an ordinary civil case where the statute of limitations was
critical anc. the question was the date on which the accident
happened and the plaintiff in that position testified that it
happened on August 11th, August 12th, August 13th, he contra­
dicted himself three times.

With one of those dates as correct,

be is within the statute of limitations, if the other two are
correct, he is without it. Now, can he survive a summary judg­
ment motion on that kind of a deposition?
MRS. JETTON:

I believe there are cases saying that

you can't erecte your own conflict.

I mean, you cannot create

an issue of credibility by coming up with three separate ver­
sions yourself and then claiming that you should be allowed a
trial to decide which of your versions is correct.
QUESTION:

So you say then that-- I was under the

repression that he could survive a summary judgment motion on
that kind of testimony.

You say I am wrong and that he could

not.
MIS. JETTON:

Assuming that there was evidence to the

contrary —
QUESTION:

No, I am assuming that all the court has

before it is his testimony as to when the accident happened and
the defendant moves for summary judgment saying that it is
barred by the statute of limitations.

And two of his versions

would bar him and the third one would not, and they are all

inconsistent with one another.
MRS. JETTON:

I think that under the summary judgment

standard he could be precluded from proceeding further, and
sunmary judgment could be entered on the theory that his claim
was incredible because it was impossible to determine what it
was.

I mean, courts are not expected to —QUESTION:

What if his last claim was the date that

wolId save his case?
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

And he repudiated the earlier ones?

He just says that when he is cross-examined

that he made a mistake, the real date is "X. "
MRS. JETTON:

Probably in a pure case like that, where

there was seme explanation of the mistake, he could survive —
QUESTION:

There wasn't any, he just says I remember

better now.
MF.S. JETTON:
summary judgment.

Even so, he might be able to survive

I don't believe that that is our case, be­

cause -QUESTION:

You think the government is entitled to a

mere lenient standard than a summary judgment standard under
this statute?
MF.S. JETTON:

Well,» under this — the language of the

statute is very similar to the summary judgment.
QUESTION:
genuine and material.

Unless the word ''frivolous" modifies the

39
MRS. JETTONs

Yes.

The summary judgment provisions

probably should —* the summary judgment standards certainly are
helpful in this case.

But you are hypothesizing where somebody

says "I made a mistake, the accident happened on a certain day."
Agosto has not claimed to make that kind of mistake but just a
familure of memory.

His testimony was that in 1921,. he worked

for many years on a 1921 birth certificate, which ha claimed
was his.

I mean this was not just a failure of memory.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Jetton, supposing that you certainly

persuaded me that he lied, deliberately and frequently and re­
peatedly anc he is totally incredible as a witness, but what
is there fchc.t makes it equally clear that the Pianettis lied?
JETTON;

Several things.

One — which I have

gone over very briefly — that the; Pianettis * testimony con­
flicts with him on subjects which —
QUESTION:

Conflicting with him, but that doesn't

ms an anything because he is totally incredible and he should
have known,

he discount his testimony a hundred percent.

Apart from hi-s testimony, what is it that makes the Pianettis'
testimony absolutely clearly false?
MRS. JETTON;

In addition to — there is no testimony

that the Pianettis said this fellow iw an incurable liar.

I

mean, he -QUESTION:

But you convinced us of that and we take

that as given, he is a liar.

So you have got to bring something

40

other than conflicts with his testimony in order to discredit
the credibility of the Pianettis.
MRS. JETTON;

Okay,

That is all I am suggesting»

I think another significant in­

gredient is the absence of documentary evidence to support his
case where there should be documentary evidence.

He was

ci sited —
QUESTION:

Didn't they give an explanation for that?

MRS. JETTONs
QUESTION:

No, it was not explained.

Wasn't their explanation that they wanted

to conceal his illegitimate birth?
MRS. JETTON:

One of the documents that should very

early on in ths proceedings — he was asked fairly early on
whether there were any landing documents, State Department

documents, manifests, this sort of material, that would show
that he came, to the United States.

He said he hadn't looked.

An! although, there was ample time after that to prepare that
kind of evidence, it was never presented.

He was asked whether

ho had ever looked for a 1924 birth certificate —
QUESTION:

These are documents that would have ex­

isted some fifty years ago?
MBS, JETTON:
QUESTION:

Yes —

The non- existence of fifty-year old docu­

ments conclusively demonstrates -that this story is false?

I try to put

And then what is it that makes the

Pianettis5 testimony totally incredible other than the absence
of f if ty-yec r -old d ocuxnents ?
MRS. JETTON:

We can deal with the absence of the

fifty-year-old documents.

It. is significant.

The testimony of

the Pianttis themselves testified that there was a baptismal
certificate for the petitioner, that he was baptised, and the
petitioner had ample funds to send an investigator to Italy to
find documents, and yet there was no effort to find —
QUESTION:
old documents.

You are still in the category of fifty-year

That is enough under the statute to say their

story is totally incredible?

That is the government's position,

I guess?
MFS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

The —

Mrs. Jetton, if this case had been tried

;'.n the District Court,

with this testimony, would you have

go tten a summary judgment?
MFS. JETTON:

We contend that if this case ware sent

to the District Court, that the District Court should enter
su; nraary judgment.

42
QUESTION:

I didn't say "should."

MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

I said "would."

WouId.

If you think there is a direct dispute in

testimony, a direct dispute, open dispute?
MI'S. JETTON:

There is a dispute as to whether the

Pianettis are credible or not.

If somebody came in and said I

am a United States citizen and the government's documents shows
that he was not an American citizen ™~
QUESTION:

If the Pianettis were credible witnesses,

would he win?
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

If these were —

Don't answer that too fast because if you

do you may throw out your summary judgement argument completely.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Jetton, let me put it another way.

•//by is the covernment so afraid of going into the District
Court in this case?
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

We are —

Are you afraid that you will get a great

avalanche of cases or something?
MRS. JETTON:
on for ten years now.

There is a concern.

This case has gone

There has been a determination that

the petitioner is deportable.

He does not challenge that he

is deportable if he is an alien.

If the case goes to the

District Court, it will then go to trial in the District Court
and will doubtless go to an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and

43
it is our contention that the Court of Appeals have properly
disposed of it at this juncture.
In addition, if this variety of claim is held by this
Court to warrant a District Court hearing, with the beneficial
effects of delay for the deportees

Of course, if we hadn't opposed it going

to the District Court, it would be al) over with by this time,

MRS. JETTON;

Probably not the appeal to the Ninth

Circuit.
QUESTION:

It would now be on appeal to the Ninth

Circuit, wouldn't it?
MIS. JETTON;

If this case is found to be ref err able

to the Ninth. Circuit, there will probably be more claims of
this substantiality,
QUESTION:

If he lost in the District Court, what

conceivably would be the basis for an appeal?
MRS. JETTON:
QUESTION;

Credibility of the witnesses.

Judges of the Court of Appeals think there

is no case which is not appealable.
QUESTION:

They are all appealable.

I haven't seen any of it.

I haven’t seen

any of these: witnesses, and can we pass on their credibility?
You told me that we had to read che whole record ana now I
hare got to pass on the credibility, too?
MRS. JETTON;

We contend that you do not have to

44
decide whether or not to do anything about the demeanor of the
Pianettis, that the record as it stands is deficient to con­
clude that their story was a fabrication»
QUESTION:

His story, his own testimony which he con­

tradicted or a number of occasions in presenting a false cer­
tificate;, you say, warrants disbelieving anything he will ever
say?
QUESTION:

I am not talking about him, I am talking

about the people, the Pianetti people,
ME.S. JETTON:

He are obviously not asking you to pass

on the demeanor evidence of the Planetfis.
QUESTION:

Well, how am I going to know from their

testimony?
MRS. JETTON:

We contend that the record itself is

such that it contains its own death wounds in the language that
this Court has used in Pittsburgh Steamship.
QUESTION:

This involves somebody's citizenship which

— I dor, t knew about you, but that is very important to me.
MRS. JETTON:

This Court, has said in Mg' Fung Ho that

it is an important right, but even in that case this Court
said that a substantial claim of citizenship had to be made
before trial de novo was required.
1 would like to just briefly address the petitioner’s
claim that there is a conflict between the Pignatello case, and
that is a Second Circuit case.

A reading of Pignatello,

initially there is a discussion of a modicum of evidence which
appears to be a reference to the frivolous standard in the
statute, but. then that court goes on to very clearly state that
in order to get a de novo hearing in the District Court, that
the issue is whether a genuine issue of fact has been pre­
sented,

That case does not contain any other standard.

It

does not. contain a frivolous standard for getting to the
District Court.
QUESTION:

They lid write an opinion in that?

MBS. JETTON:
QUESTION:

Judge Marshall.

MRS. JETTON:
the Pignatelle case

Yes, the Second Circuit did.

I believe.

In addition, the facts of

are substantially different from this.

I

believe Mr. Justice Marshall characterized the claim in that as
coherent and credible.

There was an affidavit provided by the

company commander of the person who was being deported stating
that he was a citizen.

The official government records stated

that he was a citizen, his discharge papers, as a mater of
fact.

He claimed to have been naturalized during the war.

So

there is no indication that the Second Circuit would have de­
cided this case any differently.
In sum, the petitioner's claims have been rejected
by three tribunals find it is unlikely that a fourth would reach
a different conclusion.

The purpose of rule 106(a)(5) does not

extend to providing trial de novo for petitioner's fancii:

46

claims.

We therefore submit that the judgment of the Court of

Appeals should be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you - counsel.

The

case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:38 o'clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
