MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

W© will hear arguments

Mxt in No. 76-678, Shell Oil Company against Dartt.
Counsel, you maiy proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. MARY T. KATTHIES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MATTOXES;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may

it pleas© the Court;
This case involves the interpretation and applica­
tion of Section 626(d) of the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act.

Section 626(d) provides that prior to the

institution of a civil action by a private individual under
til© act, the individual must give 180-days* notice to the*
Secretary of Labor of their intent to sue, and then must
afford the Secretary of Labor 60 days in which to conciliate
or mediate the disputes.
The issues presented, here are basically twofold.
The first issue—--and we submit that the ease could in fact be
decided on a narrower ground-—is whether the Court of Appeals
improperly intruded upon the equitable discretion of the
District Court, in overturning, the decision by tha District
Court that the relative equities in this ease did not warrant,
a tolling of the 180-clay time period sat forth in section
626(d) .
Tha broader grounds is -whether Section 626(d) is; a

4
substantial jurisdictional prerequisite to suit or it is more
analogous to a statute of limitations and f if it is more
analogous to a statute of limitations and thereby subject to
similar tolling principles, whether the actions by Mrs. Dartre
brought this case within one of the recognised tolling
principles,
Q

And which do you say it is?

MS, MATTHlESs

Obviously, Your Honor, our first

contention is that it is a substantive! jurisdictional,
prerequisite suit®,

w© believe that both the clear language

of the statuta as well as the legislative history indicate
a congrsssional intent to circumscribi private right of
action and -to have the 180-day period not modified oxcapt
p@rh.aps in very egregious circumstances cartaiuly net present
in the recced here,

W® believe that the legielative history,

y

for instance, indicates that the 180-day period was net
initially contained in

tl::

Herns©-passet! bill,

The Senate

included the 180-day requirement, and than the House receded
to the Senate's request for the 180-day requirement.

The

180 'day requirement was lobbied extensively for by management
in order to circumscribe the private right of action of
Individuals and in order -to give, we believe, the Department
of Labor close to exclusive jurisdiction of age discrimination
casas»
we believe the congressional and legislative history

5
shows employers did not' want any privata right of action to
b@ maintained because they could

&&&

the possibility of

frivolous lawsuits being brought, and frivolous lawsuits ar©
of course expansive.

And it is clear that employers clearly

preferred that there b© a limited right for private action
only in the first 180-day period, only if notice of intent to
sue was given in the 180-clay period.
We believe also the clear statutory language—which
is ©f course the bast evidence of what Congress intended—
safes forth that such notice shall be filed within 180 days.
Mrs. Dsrfet contends, I belif.ve alternatively, that
either her oral complaint to the Department ©f labor within
the 180-day period satisfied ©r it tolled the time for her to
meet the nofcice-of-inteat-to-sue requirement.

We think

clearly her ©ml complaint, which sh© stipulated included no
evidence of suing or of intent to sue—-we tslieve hsr oral
complaint clearly did not. satisfy the 180-day notice
requirement, and the Cous:t of Appeals so found.

The Court of

Appeals found, however, that the 180-day period was analogousto a statute of limitations and therefore could be tolled

on

certain equitable grounds.
We believe that ©von assuming that to® Court of
Appeals was correct, in its holding that ih© 180-day time
period is analogous to a statute of limitations, it certainly
was incorrect in finding that, fcas-9d upon substantial

6
precedent by this Court, that the situation here warranted
a tolling of that time period.

The recognized equitable

grounds for tolling & 180-day requirement or statuto of
limitations requirement are that the defendant has acted in
some way to mislead or prevent the plaintiff

from acting,

that the plaintiff was acting under some kind of recognized
legal disability or that th® plaintiff was prevented by
operation of law from acting to preserve her rights.

We

believe -she fact situation here establishes—and th© record
so shows*—that all Mrs. Dartt did. she called an attorney

of her age.

The attorney did not tell her of the notice
The attorney told her to go to th© Department of

Sh© want to the Department of Labar.

The Department

of Labor treated her complaint sis being a complaint which
could activate the administrative, investigative mechanisms.
The Department of Labor did not consider her oral complaint to
be a notice of intent to sue-.

In fact, th© files show that

no notice of intent to sue had been filed.

And then proce-ad&d

to process the complaint.
W® do not believe that these circumstances indicabsKrs. Dartt—»1 am stepping back just a moment.

Mrs. Dartt

also stated that whan sho want to th® Department of L »bor, she
said, "My thought was th® Department of Labor would handle it.
Then why bother with im attorney?

Why bother with the expense

7
of an attorney?51

She was.' asked in the District Court whether

she made any inquiry as to what was necessary to preserve
her rights, if she had inquired at any time from tho Department
©£ Labor as to what she needed to do, and her answer was no,
that she did, that she went to them and she thought they would
take care of everything.

And, therefore, she had properly

relied upon them to advise her as t© her 180-day-notice-of~
intent-to-su© requirement, which the Department of Labor did
not do but which the Court of Appeals found they had no
statutory obligation to do,,
Q

Ms. Matfehies, I take it there is no question

of or intimation of bad faith on the part ©f Shell hex®, .is
there?
MS. MAT-TRIES i

I believe there is absolutely nothing

in the record that would show any bad faith or evil me,chinafelons or anything of that, nature, 'fear Honor.
0

The other side of that coin is, How was Shell

prejudiced by the result below?
MS. MATTHIES:

Shell was prejudiced by the result

below, Your Honor, because it was never given early on a notice
that Mrs. Dartfe Intended to maintain a civil action against it.
0

But yon certainly knew of her discomfitures and

concern, did you not?
MS. MATTHIES?
Q

X bag your pardon?

I say you certainly know of her discomfiture

8
and concern.
MS. MATTHIESs

We knew that sha had filed and

registered an oral complaint with the Department of Labor.
The Department of Labor had told Shall that she had not filed
any notice of intent to sue.

So, we knew, that the Department

of Labor had a complaint before it, that they were in the
process of investigating her complaint.

It was and is Shell's

position that her complaint, had absolutely no merit whatso­
ever.

And w® fully believed that the Department of Labor,

upon a complete investigation, would a© find and we mouM to®
without any suit whatsoever.

Because wa were in the posture

where we had no notice of intent ‘to sue, ws were not givcm the
opportunity, within fch© tins- which

Congress established, to

take a close look at the possibility that she was going to sue
us and 'therefore look at settlement in light of nuisance law­
suit value, which may have still have been to her benefit, in
light of possibly increased litigatio:.*» expenses.

I think that

anybody who has been in practice knows that when they are
dealing with a client, the client tends, when a claim is;
initiated—say, for instance, a contract claim.

Someone writes

and says, "You owe m© such and such and so and so."

They are

not as inclined to settle that casse as they are whei hhey get
a clearcut notice through the attorney calling me, the attorney
for the opposing side calling the attorney for the client, or
through some other means where they get clearcut notice that

9
they ar© going to ba sued if they do not settle.
Q

Then it is your position that this period ©f

time is a rigid limitation period?
MS, MATTHIES*

Wo believe that there is nothing

inherently unfair to Mrs*. Dartt, and w© believe-"
Q

Can you concede there ever might be circum­

stances where equitable principles or otherwise* might lead
to an opposing result?
,

MSo MATTHIES:

I can see, Your Honor, that in certain

rather egregious situations—for instance, I think if
Mrs. Dartt had been able to show that Shell had immediately
upon, discharging her hurried hex; off and locked her up in a
Mexican* jail for six months and thereby she had bean unable
to fulfill her notice-of-intent-to-sue requirement, and wo
did this knowing full well chat w© were prohibiting her from
doing that, that fundamental principles of justice would
certainly I think hold that no on© can profit from any wrong
and therefore that timeliness, could be mod if iced in that
situation, although I am not really sure in that kind of
situation it would even he a tolling so much as it would h®
an adjustment of the equity.
Q

Do yoh'jfxot really have thro® alternatives here

rather than two, the first being the type ©f limitation that
applies when you are filing a notice of appeal from the
District Court to the Court of Appeals, that there just

10
virtually

i$x& m oxccrptii-ji'A for it, and

the second bexng

the statuta of limitations type of thing, that, as my
Brother Blackman suggests, there may wall be tolling situations
that are fairly well established by law, and the third being
a sort ©f principle of X&ch&vs, which would bs a good deal
looser and where, if the defendant could not show any preju­
dice, you might well permit them to proceed without any great
showing of equitable tolling principles on their side?

MS. MATTH1ES:

Yes, Your Honor, there- would

certainly ba those three possibilities?.

I believe that

plaintiff la fact argued in the District Court.» although it
did not continue to press that in the Court of Appeals, to my
recollection, that the 180-day requirement was in fact what
I believed they termed as directory ra her than mandatory.
And that would fall into 1 suppose what you would call the
third classification of cssea.

2 do i iot really think that tills• time limitation,
the 180-day

fall into the third

category of cases.

I think that, the close analogy perhaps is

the 180-day requirement here to the 180-day requirement under

X note in the Sen its report on th© naw possible
amendments to th® Age Discrimination in Employment Act that
the Senate, when they deleted tbs 180-day requiremart from
th® notioa-of-intent-to-sue provision, stated that they -.fore
deleting th© requirement of -the notice of intent to sue, which
I think kind of tends to indicata that the Senate thought that
the 180-day requirement was a substantial requirement.

And

the legislative history itself indicates that the Senate
considered it to be a substantial requirement when th® Hous©
deleted the 180-day requirement from the Senate-passed bill,
and th® Senate put it right back in, saying,. "We want there
to b@ a 180-day limitation."

So, if we were to take the position here that we
were going to allow any kind of tolling—for instanta, of th®
3.80-day requirement--! think what we would get into, Your
Honor, is adopting an approach that this House and the Semite
ended up specifically rejecting because 'the House bill had
provided for th® allowance of a filing of a notice cf intent
to sue any time within f.:

statute of limitations period, th©.,

two-yessr statute of limitations period.
"No.

And the Senate said,

W® want a notice of intent to su® filed within 180 days."

And X think that that indicates very clearly that tbs Congress
considered it to be a substantial requirement.
So, kind of turning basic to th© decision by th©
Court, of Appeals, although the Court. of Appeals did

Central Railroad Company.,

And the rationale behind the

tolling allowed by the Tenth Circuit was that in this par­

filing or the registering of the oral complaint—anti e.
subsequent isolated settlement inquiry by the Department of
Labor fulfilled the notice and conciliation functions of
Section 626(d) and therefor© there was no particular reason

government had savings o*: transfer provisions»

And had the

plaintiff resided in any other part of the country vhan where
he did in Burnett» there was a good possibility that his
cause of action would have been saved.

And this Court,

looking at the fact, that there was only a defect in venue
and the fact that the Congress had indicated the desire for
uniform time limitations in fila, and also noting that the
Congress had indicated a desire for saving

improperly venued

actions by allowing transfer, having enacted a statute to that
precise effect, this Court decided that there should be a
tolling in Burnett*
It is also significant in Burnett that the plaintiff
would have lost all means of relief.
It is also significant in Burnett that the
defendant could have waived„ according to this Court, the
defect 1» venue.

If in fast the Secti;;» 626(d) requirement

Unexcelled Chemical Corp.

And In the Unexcelled Chemical

Corporation ease this Court expressly held that if Congress
thought that prejudice would occur by the fact that there- was
no tolling of a limitation period

during the time when

administrative actions in the Department of Labor wara beInc
undertaken, then Congress could go about remedying that
particular situation.
Q

This act also has a two-year limitation, does!

it not?
MS. MATTHIES:

Yes, Your Honor, a two-year or

three-year, if wilful, but yes.

What is the senso of having that if you have

this 180-day one as. jurisdictional?
MS. MATTHIES:

Q

The 180-day period—

If that is;jurisdictional, why do you need the

two-year statute of limitafcions?
• MS. MATTHIES:

Ones», the -plaintiff has filed a notice

They must bring suit some time within the

'To,:limitations provision.

So, the 180-day period Is not

a limitation provision.

Q

Could I not assume from that that you could net

be injured unless it was two years'?

At least Congress did not

think you would be.

MS. MATTHIES s

I am. not. «ure I understand the

16
question»
Q

I understand that Congress said if you do not

file the suit within two years, you cannot file it.

and the

reason for that is because if you do not file within two years,
you would be injured.

The employer would be injured.

My

query is. How can you be injured before the two years—
specifically at 181 days?
MS. MATTHIES:

We believe that we can be injured.

Your Honor, because the employee in a Department of Labor
lawsuit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act are
two entirely different situations.
a private right of action.

An individual can bring

There does not have to be, under

Title VII standards, any finding of reasonable cans® by the
agency.

The employee ear; .simply file a suit—a good suit,

bad suit, frivolous suit, lots of merit to it, no m&rit to it
at all,

if they act quickly to preserve that right and act

within 180 days to give their notice of intent to sue.
On the other hard, the Department of Labor i.s
.

'then to bring suit itself also within that two-year limitation
period.

vuh/.i.e that t\K- -reoaen that tha 180-dry requirou^.nt ir there
is precisely ho have tfm effect which'is had hare, vhich is to

17
weed out the complaints of individuals who do not act within
a timely manner to assert their right to file a suit by filing
a notice of intent to sue,
We think that the arguments that that is too short
a time limitation are frankly addressed to the wrong branch
of the government when they are addressed to this Court.

In

fact/ ws really think that the fact that they may be short
begs the question of the fact that lawsuits may be dismissed
as a result of failure to comply with the 180-day requirement.
It begs the question because the necessary and expected
result of the short limitation is—
Q

You said it may be dismissed?

I thought your

argument was it had to be dismissed.
MB. MATTHIES:
Q

Had to be dismissed.

You said may,

MS. MATTHIES:

You had not changed that;.

Your Honor/

I have not changed it.

No, I do submit that it is a mandatory requirement.

And I

think w© ought to analogize that requirement in fact to Title
VII standards.

Under Titi® VII/ if the charging party does not

file a charge with th© ESE within 180 days, their right to sue
is lost entirely.

And this Court has held that; that particular

period/ which is over and above the two-year limitation on
back pay under Titi® VII, is in fact a jurisdictional pre­
requisite.

And the effects on a Title VII plaintiff of

applying the 180-day charging requirement as a jurisdictional

18
prerequisite ;ar® much mors severe than they are hero, because
here Mrs» Dartfc still had a remedy expressly approved by
Congress»

She had instituted a complaint with the Department

of Labor.

The Department of Labor could in fact act on her

complaint and could in fact sue on her behalf if it were so
inclined„
So, the strict application of the title limitation
in this particular situation is much less harsh in operation
than it is -to strictly apply it. in the case of Title VII
plaintiff.
Q

Is the notics function, in your view, a large

on© her©*—that is, the notice to the employer so that they can
identify the facts and assemble the information promptly
before it is lost?

Is that a large factor in the 180-day—

MS. MATTHIES:
not. really think it is.

I do not really think it is.

I do

I think that clearly in 180 days you

do not lose sight of the fact you have; witnesses die and
tilings of this nature.
Q

But affer 130 days you might.

Does not that

prospect-MS. MATTHIES:

There is that, point, that obviously

the statute of limitations are arbitrary, and they are
established to cut off rights justifiably ©r not.

But I think

that the real purpose of the 180-day requirement is in fact
to 1st the employer know that it is going to b© sued because

19
»7© all knew/ that if you are going to be sued, you are more
inclined to go about settling the case in a. speedy fashion.
It also acts as a trigger to the Department of Labor to let
ishe Department of Labor know chich cases it has in its office
it needs to devote concerted conciliation activities to hoar.
For instance, in this case, when Mrs. Darfet
registered her oral complaint, the Department of Labos just
kind of put the case in its normal processing and took a look
at it and never asked Shell--even made its preliminary cursory
inquiry as to whether Shell was interested in settling until
some 30 or better days after the complaint had bean registered
with it.

So, the Department of Labor is, I would say, as

equally prejudiced as both the plaintiff and the employer are
when toe notice of intent to.sue - is not given because—
q

How is the Department of Labor prejudiced?

What did they lose?
1:3. MATTHXESs
Q

The Department of Labor—

What did they lose?

MS. MATTHIES:

The Department of Labor warts the

ability t© know when it got—
Q

This employee has lost her job.

What did. they

lose compared to that?
ms.

Q

MATTHXESs

Comparable to that, I am net suro.

I am.
I wan saytog 1 dc believe that the BepartooPt

20
of Labor in its administration of the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act certainly ne&ds to know whan it is supposed to
exert exhaustive conciliation efforts and when it is..- not
supposed to exert exhaustive conciliation efforts.

Normally

the Department of Labor will not. exert exhaustive conciliation
efforts until after they have decided there is merit to the
charge.
However, there is an exception to that, and they
will exert exhaustive conciliation efforts when they get a
notice of intent to su®.

They did not exert exhaustive

conciliation efforts hare because they did not know they had
to because they did hot think they had a notice, of Intent to
sue.

And I think that is important.
I would like to reserve the rest of my tins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFERSON G. GREER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF 'THE RESPONDENT

MR. GREER;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
When Congress passed the Age Discrimination Act in

So i the 180 days limitation was placed ia thera for that

There' is nothing in the legislative history that,

incidates that the Congress intended the 130-day limitation
■to be jurisdictional.

In fact, the latest pronouncement by

Senator Williams, who is fch© floor manager for the Senatepassed bill, which is now in the House Conference Committee—
put it very clearly that it has never been our intent that
the 180-day notice period bs considered a jurisdictional

MR. GREER;

That is not what I asked you.

For 110 days.

After the notice of intent to

Yes, Tour Honor, and it is interesting

to note that when Shall Oil Company had noti.ce of thin
complaint, they were on notice that this Labor Department
could bring an action at my time ord did rot have to wait for
any notice of intent i© sue,

They could be sued at any time.

Yes.

Thar-3 was never any such statement to Shell.

So,

they could not rely on that.
it is interesting to note that the Labor Department,
charged with the administration of this act, had since its
passage in 1967 taken the position that this was non-jurisdicticnal.

Mr. Speer has testified to that on thcj hearing in

District Court,

And, as this Court has previously said in

the Griggs v. Duke Power Company case, the.administration,
interpretation, of an act; is entitled to great deference.
W© suggest that, this was not. a. case where the
plaintiff slept cm her righto.

She did everything that a

parson could reasonably be

tod to do, as the Tenth

Circuit found,

i$h© sought <--»t counsel«

She filed hsr

complaint nine days after they had told her that she. did not
have any potential because of her age.

And she; made repeated

calls fco the Labor Department, asking them what was going on.
"What is gcine on on my lawsuit?"—-to gat some sort of
assurance from Mr. Sp@ar,
’‘ment

And sh© did what the Labor

if you think that you have suffered discrimination, g© to the
local wage and hour office of the Labor Department, which i-j
exactly what she did.
We think that every purpose of the act was served.
The defendant had notice by virtu© of Mr. Speer investigating
the complaint.

The Labor Department began investigation and

conciliation, just as is intended in a notice of intent to
sue.

And Shell has suffered, so far as we can see, no damage

by a 36“day delay.
Q

Your position, I take it, then is that as long

as you file a complaint, you need never file a notice of
intent to sue.
MR. GREER:

Suppose the Labor Department gets tha

complaint but they ar® just too busy and do not try to
conciliat® at all.
MR. GREER:

I do not think you can say that the

defendant had proper notice then.

He must have proper notice.

Of course, these two eases that the defendant has railed on so
heavily—this Robbins v. Electrical Workers and Johnson v.
Railway^Express-— the Court pointed out there the procedure
followed in pursuing two separate remedies did not guarantee
notice to the defendant.

In Electrical Workers case; they were

proceeding ur; te: tbs National L^h-pr Relations Act gri-.wrnrrsa
procedure, a separate, • independent, distinct action».
Q

The purpose of it, I thought you said, was to

give th© Labor Department time to conciliate, not to give the
defendant notice.

MR. GREER:

It is merely'to speed up the process that

was bogging down Titi® VII, the 60-day notice as well as the

MR» GttEE:

Q

'ilz can go nhB&d and bring his lawsuit,

't.-®n if th© defendant dess rest know c thing?

34
MR. GREER:

That is true.

That: is true.

That is

why th©v pat the 60-day notice in, I believe, is so the
claimant can get on with his lawsuit rather than waiting for
the right-to-sue letter vrhich is bogged down under Titi® VII.
They experience all kinds of delays in wating for the right-tosu© letter.
If I may proceed with fell® discussion of the
Electrical Workers case, there you had two separate and
distinct remedies, and the claimant bed attempted to proceed
under the grievance procedure, v/hereas; the Court said that
that would not afford the notice to the defendant a -, the
proceedings under Title VII.

Likewise in Johnson v

Railway

Express, you had two separate and distinct statutory
remedies,, on® under Title Vll and one tinder Section 1981.

Put

in this case the plaintiff is proceeding under one statute.
There is on© remedy, on© cause ©£ action.

It is whether ’’-he

Labor Department brings the action or whether the plaintiff
brings the action.

And sine® the defendant had notice, the

purposes of the act wore served in all respects, we believe.
We think that, as the Tenth Circuit held, there was 1© facto
fulfillment. and that plaintiff should prevail.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

REEUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MS. IV RY T. MATTHIf.S
CP BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
. •

sral questions which

35
were presented to Mr» Greer that 1 believe warrant some
further discussion»

I balisve Hr, Justice Stevens asked if

there was any evidence of fraudulent concealment in this
particular case, and Mr, Grear responded that I guess the
fraudulent concealment was the dragging of the feet by Shall
with respect to furnishing information»

In the first place,

I d© not think that the mere dragging of one's feet would
amount to fraudulent concealment under any cases that I know
dealing with fraudulent concealment.
In the second place, there is simply not- any evidences
in the record that Shell was dragging its feet..

Th&re were

no

statements mads by Mr. Speer, the wage and hour investigator,
stating that he thought the delay was unreasonable.

As e

matter of fact, I believe the statements to that effect by the
Court, of Appeals wcra no more than she'.or speculation as to
the reasons for the delay*
Shell, on ths c=thor hand, presented avider-.ee

shewing that the reason for the delay was the large amount of
data wh;luh tho Iteparfewaat of Lai or wart@d.

I question Love v. Pullman's

In the first place, in Love v. Palloan there

I do not know how thu ADA
