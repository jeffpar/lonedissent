P R O C E E D I N G S
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argumentis

first, this morning in 76-695, University of Missouri. Board of
Curators against Horowitz.
Mr. Wright, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN E. WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I an Marvin Wright, attorney representing the
Petitioners in this case.

The Petitioners are:

the University

of Missouri, the Governing Board of that institution, the
Provost for Health Sciences on the campus of the University
located in Kansas City, end the Dean cf the School of Medicina,
located on the campus of the University of Missouri at Kansas
City.
The Respondent, is Ms. Charlotte HorovritiJ, who was e.
student in that medical school until her dismissal for
deficient academic performance in 197.1.
Now, the is «tie, primary .issue before the Court today
is that of whether or not a medical student in a public
institution of higher education is entitled to amti.ee of
charges and a hearing prior to dismissal from that school for
deficient academic performance.
The second :1s st© is that of:

whether or not, whan a

4
medical student has prior knowledge of deficient academic
performance and the reasons are not disclosed and made public,
whether or not that student has

&

stigma imposed upon them

under the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment, when a formal
hearing is not held?
The last issue, naturally, is that of whether or not
procedures which were utilized by the University of Missouri
were fair to the student and. complied with any requirements of
procedural due process.
Now, the facts, just very briefly, of the case arc
this:
The school was established in 1971« The Governing
Board adopted a document entitled "An Academic Plan" <,
Now, for purposes of the case today, tills Academic
Plan established what is called a Comici 1 on Evaluation, which
is a committee charged with the responsibility of reviewing the
academic performance of students and then making appropriate
recommendations.
There1 is ®. second committee, which is referred to as
a Coordinating Committee. The responsibility of this committee
is to review recommendations coming out of the first-raentioi 3d
committee.

This latter committee makes recommendations bo fa©

Dean of the school, and tne Dean makes final decisions with
respect; to student dismissal.
Now, the rules and regulations of the instituti.on, as

5
set forth in this academic plan, do not. extend to the students
the right to appear before either of these committens , or the
Doan9 when the question Is that of tn ©valuation of an academic

performance*
The s June document sets forth tho fact that graduating
requirements of the institution and tho primary goal - naturally
is that of graduating competent and safe physicians, those
that are qualified not only in basic medical scdence knowledge,
but- also qualified in the sens© of clinical competency.
QUESTION:

If the university provided for automatic

dismissal or termination on failure for two successive years
to maintain an average of 70, let us sav, would they need a
hearing if it developed that for two years the avere *© war? 60?
MR. WRIGHTs

No, Your Honor, I do not, believe that

it would, any more chan in the case at bar. Because it boils
down to a question of 'the academic ©valuation being plated
upon the profescors of the institution.

It is for this reason

the professors have given the equation of 60 in your example,
thy school Ins set forth requirements of an average of 70.
QUESTION:

In c&her words, ycuhre saying tuafwhcsn

the judgment is aubjectivs by committe<s, it's not any different
from

on a mathematical evaluation?
-'■To WRIGHTs Wcsl.l, fcbst’s? correct, Your Honor,
:

itu 0..;.,.,

\t thra University of Missouri &t

city.

6

a numerical figura is not placed upon 4'- student's performance.
But obviously, in placing & 60 on & student performance,the
subjective judgment of the professor is what leads to that
conclusione
Nowt the respondent in this case, Ch&rlotts H ore wits,
the University has never reload any question concerning this
individual’s intellectual ability.

She cam© to the institution

with fine academic credentials, having graduated from Barnard
Collega in chemistry, Columbia University with a Master’s in
Psychology, She had one year in a Ph.D. program in Fh&rmaeoiogy
at Duke, which was the same as the first-year medical student
curriculum.

She attended th© Women's Medical College of

Pennsylvania, and fo?r soma four or fivn years,prior to
admission at the University of Missouri., worked at the National
Institute of Health,
questions

MR, WRIGHT;

Is your client a four-year school?
Sir, the University of Missouri at

Kansas City Medical School is a six-year institution.

By

six years, I nru;:s a student enters straight ^ut of high r:rhe>1
for a six-year curriculum.
QUES TION s
MR. WRIGHT:

Pre~me<i s choc» 1,
Yes, sir.

Eleven months a year.

The first two years p rimari .y

based with undergraduate work? the last, four years primarily
concerned -ith. what is consi.Gwr&d a typical typo medical school

arrangement.
QUESTION:

Asia there are repeated references in th®

briefs to this criterion of being a "safe” physician.

That

was kind of a new
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— term to rae in this context. What does

that mean?
MR. WRIGHT:

"Safe physician”, as it was described

in testimony at the trial court, is that the student has
sufficient medical knowledge, basic science knowledge, and
the student has the ability to function in a clinical setting
with patients, so as to render primary care to th© general
public.
Now, it's been explained that that dees net mean that
the student is all~kncwledgeable in every conceivable medical
question that would come ip, but to be a "safe physician", the
student would have to h&v© sufficiunt knowledge to know that
it was going to be nscese; *ry to obtain th© assistance of ether
physicians or health care professionals.
Sc the goal of the tnstiti&on and that of '©ing

a afe

physician is that they can render care to the g moral

public: primary medical cure, not, advanced specialized type
care, beo&usa naturally that, comes from internship and
residencies after they -would graduate from a medical school.
QUESTION: Does

university rim any other medical

8

school?
MRo WRIGHT;

Yes, Your Honor? it; does»

The University operates a medical school on th© campus
in. Columbia, Missouri®

That, medical school is what, people

have referred to as th© traditional medical school»
QUESTIONS

That is a post-graduate school?

MR» WEIGHT;

Yes, Your Honor®

This is a school v?har@*

to be admitted to that school? you must; have an undergraduate
degree»
QUESTION; Right»
MR* WRIGHT; And than you g© into four years of medical

QUESTION;

Right.

MR» WEIGHT;

Now? tha school at th© University of

Missouri-Kansas City is '& school which is referred to .as a
docent typa institution, whereby

they have shortened the years

over-all? but they require going to school 11 months out cf

Now? a docent its e. physician, a professor? who is
assigned ti-i primary rs-vvmsibility ©f guiding this student
throughout their entire -*•
QUESTION;

And counseling»

MR. WRIGHT; •Right, sir.
QUESTION:

Would I be correct in the .infervmc© that

I drat :.:ru;:n -:h -x brifefr;

T.;.■ ■ e.trh&sis of this medical sch> ol

9

is on producing practicing clinical physicians rather than on
people who ware going to devote their careers to medical
research and sc

on?

MR* WRIGHTs

That is true, Your Honor*

The school

has very readily stated from the very beginning it's the
reason that the school was establisheds

was the responsibility

to provide doctors to render primary car©»

And the school

encourages students, and notifies them ©f that fact when they
are interviewed for admission to the school» And the respondent
in this case, at the tires of application to the school and
interview, was so advised that th® school requires not only
basic medical science knowledge, but a clinical competency
that all students were going to be judged on the ssirj basis,
as far as meeting any requirements for graduation*
QUESTIONs

Now, what does "clinical competency*

mean?
MR. WRIGHTs CXluie&l competency, Your Honor, is 15 .?
ability for a doctor t.o function in a patient setting.

It is

the ability to take the basic medical sciencs knowledge, which
©a® learns from books, and to apply that to & given patient,

to a given situation.

It involves all tit© way from acquiring

a total end complete medical history from the'patient to the
proper type of examination, aha proper -type of testing, and
then the ability to relate the basic

medical knowledge into a

diagnosis and a formulation plan whereby that patient can be

10
treated.

And this is, unfortunately, the position where the

institution found that the respondent in this case was not
deames d to ba quali fled 0
NOW, —

QUESTI OH:

This vmsn' t as a result cf written or

even oral examinations, but as a result of observation of her
conduct, in that setting, is that it.?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor, this is true.

Now,

the individual scored high on all written examinations, the
didactic part of th© work0
Now, as was pointed out by the •>- her docent, and es
pointed out by the trial judge after the trial, it's
unfortunate, but th© individual apparently assumed that she
could become a doctor by reading a book, and net treating
patients and getting thai necessary ©xp-arionc© there.
The clinical competency evaluation was naturally c*a
a subjective judgment of th© professors that she was under,
and that viewed her performance in a clinical setting.
QUESTION:

What war® the kinds •—* excuse im, go

MR. WRIGHT:

Your Honor, I ’would ~~ excuse ms just a

I would also like to point out that the institution,

after she had bean on probation for a period of roughly sew.t
or sight months, thev commit&jes, the too committees and tea

ia May of 1973, sonus fives months latere

And m. appeal was

taken by the student, and the institution, set up a panel of
seven doctors-, none of which had had appreciable contact with
the student.

So as to got the opinions of others jtst. rather

than the faculty itself of the school,
QUESTION s

You 3ay "not appreciable", how much

contact?
MR, WRIGHT*

Your Honor,

non» e£

them were instructors

that instructed her in the medical school,
QUESTIONs

All right, are you saying they didn't

have any contact?
MR, WRIGHT:
have any, because

No, Your Honor, I cannot sty -they didn’t

QUESTIONs
MR, WRIGHT:

Well, how much?
Your Honor, I have

I do not have

th© answer to that. They my have seen her at some time in a
clinic, but they war®, non® of them were docents of the school,
non® of them were classified as sub~docents in a hospitale
It's just ‘that they may have bumped into the student at seme

time, making clinical rounds in & hospital,

12
har?
MR* WRIGHTs

No, Your Honor# they ware not. They

wore picked because each of these individuals had had prior
experience as professors in a medical school.

They wore

individuals that, th© Dean knew had outstanding medical
reputations# and since they had had prior experience with,
medical education# felt that they would bs appropriate people
to actually carry out & practical and

oral examination.

QUESTION s They were picked by tire Dean?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yssf Your Honor.

They wore picked by

the Dean.
QUESTION: And what instructions wars they given?
Is that in the record?
MR. WRIGHT:

Ye.i, Your Honor# it is.

The instructions

were by way of a. conference which the Dean held with each of
Idles® physicians? Also on March 15th latter# which is in th©
Appendix# the written instructions were given.
QUESTION: And they determined that her clinical
ability was bad?
.MR* WRIGHT:
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:

Pardon me, Your Honor?
What did they determine was bad?
Your Honor, the seven individuals each

*»- they did not meet as a composite group — each one of them
took the student through an oral and practical examination,
functioning with atm or more patients *

Novi# tiva result was

13

that on© out of the seven said sh© was competant ant: qualified
to graduate.

That individual examined the student in pathology

which was strictly a laboratory setting? no patients involved.
On® doctor, in General Medicine, recommended that she
be graduated, though ha said she was not

would not bo

acceptable as an intern in his hospital.
The other five physicians, each independent of one
another, cams in with recommendations to either* drop the student
immediately from medical school, or saying she was not qualifies!
to graduate.
How, each of these examinations had been described,
and it was so described in the trial court, as being the
equivalent of what the American Medical Association has for
Special Board Certification, where an individual will spend
three to four hours with a given medical doctox in a clinical
setting.
QUESTIONS
isn't it?

This is a little below the Special Board,

By eight years, about, isn't it?
MR. WRIGHT?

Yes, Your Honos:, it is.

Y@s, Your Honor, the equivalent of th©

And th© reason being —

QUESTIONS So she would have — if all had gone well,
sh© would have been there for two years before graduating?
MR. WRIGHTs

That’s correct, Your Honor*

And she was admitted

as an advanced-standing student

because of her previous educational background and training*
QUESTIONS What were th© clashes or sessions which the
record indicated she failed to attend with regularity?
MR* WRIGHT;

Wall, Your Honor, th© first time that

a question arose with respect to clinical competency, it was
the first rotation really she was on where a clinic was
involved, was in March of *72, which is scam© seven montes after
sh© started attending 'the* institution*

And they war© having

difficulty with respect to tit© clinical performance*
QUESTIONs

Mr. Wright, I’m a little concerned, or

interested, rather, why was sh© admitted to the school at all?
in view of the type of emphasis they have on their education.
Here was somebody with a college education, soma medical
©xperlsnce, v&Al they bring ’rin at an advanced striding*

15
Did they bring many in. this way , or —
MRo WRIGHT s

Yes, they brought 13 students in with

advanced standing at that, time „
QUESTION:

Is this because the school was new, and

they needed then to fill up, because it’s hard to gee into
other medical schools, we have been told.

MRo WRIGHT:

The school was new, Your Honor»

I do

not, feel that it was a compulsion to fill the institution at

alio

The reason, as X previously stated, at the time of

interview with the student, the student was advised as to the
primary goals of the institutione
QUESTION: Does the record show where she bad had
medical schoole&perienco before, and why she didn't stay there?
MR. WRIGHT:

Your Honor, shy had on© year in a Ph.D.

program it Pharmuco.'-ogy al Rule-2 University.

New, thy

significance of that in the fact that the Ph.D. program there
the first year is the saraa curriculum ss first* year modi cal
students have at; Duke University.
Ska next attended tin© Women*s Medical collage in
Pennsylvania, and, after ■* ftm months, withdrew in good
standing b©causa of ill health.

questions, but •*-MR. WRIGHTS
QUESTION s

Th.it'!3 all right.
«« approximately how many stud ants in , v&ch

MR. WRIGHT; Well, Your Honor, the school —

MR. WRIGIITs

‘His school

QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:
figures.

Yes.
Your Honor, I cannot give you the exact

I believe that the institution is running approxi­

mately 75 to 100 students per class,
QUESTION:

Does the record show how many do not —

involuntarily leave?
MR. WRIGHT:

No, Your Honor, there is nothing in

the record pertaining to that.
QUESTION:

So, as far as the record shows, Ms.

Horowitz might have been Urn only one, or she might have been
on© of a dozen? is that right?
MR. WRIGHT: As far as the record is concerned, that
is true, Your Honor.
2 know there have been other students which have been,
dismissed for academic deficiency, but that is not i i the
record.
QUESTION: So we don't know if she was 'Bio only on®

or if th©r<3 were twenty others or —
MR. WRIGHT:
th© only on©.

Your Honor, ah© was not — she was no j

17
QUESTION j
MR» WRIGHT:

But th© record
—» has not; besn the only one that; has

been dismissed from th© institution for academic deficiencies.
QUESTION:

Her year were there any others, from

her class were there any others?
MR. WEIGHT:

I do not believes so, Your Honor.

I believe she was the only on© that was dismissed at that time
Now, in tills case, at th© time that the respondent
was dismissed from the medical school, the status of the .lav;,
so to speak, in th© country was 'that, it was not. necessary for
a. student who was being dismissed for academic deficiencies
to receive a notice of charges and a hearing..
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

You say at that time.

Do you think **~

Y©s, Your Honor.
—- except for this case, th© status of

th© law has changed?
MR. WRIGHT:
has.

No, Your Honor.

I do not feel that it

I think that th© decision of tho Eighth Circuit Court of

Appeals in this case ~ • and I respectfully submit this •—
that th© Court is mistaken in th© interpretatioa which they
not only placed upon an © irlier decision of theirs, but upon,
a n&sinterpretation of decisions of this Court.
sp.jak primarily t©

And I would

fact ‘that th© first case was 'hat of

Co;^.©12y jys ^ ^University of. Jhraoat, a medical student case,
whs-re the Court set forth th© reasoning for there being no

13
.

?

necessity for & notice of charges and a hearing»
And there were several other'; cases# including thu
Fifth Circuit# which had held that that was true.
Now# "idle Eighth Circuit had handed down a Graenhi 11
decision, that was Gmjsphill v. Balley # out of the medical
school of tiie University ©f Iowa.

In that case# the Eighth

Circuit specifically held that the student was entitled to a
notice of charges and a hearing. But what they said in that
case was that because the school had stated that the student
did not have the-, intellectual ability fco be & doctor? and
further# they coraciunicated that to the Association of American
Medical Colleges.
Now# they italicised in ‘their opinion the fact that
they v?@ra not sending this back for an;,* hearing on performance
of the student# or an academic Evaluation.
So I would submit chat til© case did not stand for
what, the Eighth Circuit majority indicated that it did.
Now# there was a dissent# we requested a rehearing
or transfer of court, @n banc,
Circuit wrote & dissent#

The Chief Justice of the Eighth

joined by two other judges, pointing

out that they had misinterpreted Greenhill. -And one of the
other judges that joined in the dissent actually wrote the
opinion in Greenhill,
Now#

eh© Eighth. Circuit also relied upon the Rotfe

decision of this Court is 1S720

19
Now, Roth involved a n©n-t®nur@d professor in the
State of Wisconsin*

The Court in that case did not find a

deprivation of liberty interest, nor did it find a deprivation
©f property interest*

The Court looked to the laws ©f

Wisconsin, looked to rules and regulations of the institution#
as to whether or not there was a property interest, and found
none to exist.
Now, I would submit ‘that in the case we have before
the Court today that, a student, in higher education in the
State of Missouri does not have a right to a msdice! education.
There are no statutes in the State of Missouri extending
such rights*

Secondly, the University of Missouri, the rules

and regulations of that university

do not extend such a right.

With respect to the liberty interest that was covered
in Roth, the Court looked to the good name, reputation, honor
and integrity, as to whether or not it was adversely affectes
by what th^govemment was doing to ths given individual.
j\s I previously stated, 'the Court found in that
that there was not a stigma, them was not a liberty
interest.

Because of the fact that thar® was no shewing that

there was a charge or allegation of dishonesty, immorality,
or that the charge wag going to seriously damage 'the standing
of the individual in the community.
Now, I would submit to the Court that this is
certainly the situation in tie case th.Kfc we* re considering

2G

today, because 'die UniversityL at no point in time has ever
challenged the honesty , the morality, the integrity or the
i

.

intellectual ability of this studentI would further submit that the liberty interest,
of the medical student and the University of Missouri, is not
any greater than the liberty interest of a non-tenured professor.
Now, in the Roth decision it was pointed out that
the individual might be- somewhat less attractive for other
employment. And I don't think there's any question but what
the individual would be somewhat less attractive.

But th«

individual was not foreclosed from seeking other employment
even in the State of Wisconsin.
I would submit that in the crss which we have, I
don’t think there’s any question but what the student would b~
somewhat less attractive to other medical schools.
QUESTION:
could she?
on®.

She couldn't be a.emitted to any of them,

Unless she was subject to be readmitted to this

Isn’t that what the rule is?
MI'U WRIGHT;

No, Voire Honor, I don't *— I do not

believe that that is the rule.
QUESTIONs

Isn't that the rule among the Association

of Medical Collages?
MR. 7RIGHT;

Non to ay knowledge, no, sir.

not.
QUESTION:

You don't knew?

It is

21

MR. WEIGHTS

I do not, ~~ I cannot answer it clearly

100 per cent guarantee., no, sir»

But I do not, believe that that

is the ruling of the Association.
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence on that subject at

all?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor,, there was evidence.

There was one professor —- not professor, pardon may one of
the seven examining physicians, Dr. Cohan stated that ha felt
that a dismissal for academic deficiency would affect the
ability of the student to get into other medical schools, and
to obtain employment, in other areas, health-related areas.
Now, I — you know, I would submit that there isn't
any question but; what they’re going to be somewhat lass
attractive? but it does not foreclose —
QUESTION: Did Dr. Cohen attribute that to some fixed
rule, or just his subjective judgment?
MR. WRIGHT:

No, Your Hosier, I think that it was

his subjective judgment.

And he readily admitted that medical

experts can disagree as far as the performance of given
individuals or a given student.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe I should ask another

is

this school approved by the Association?
MR. ARIGHT:
QUESTION;
A.. ARIGHT:

Yea, Your Honor, it is.
When?
Tv@;;.I, it had provisional neer xiLtctii ■■
*

22

whan it. opened its doors in 1971«
QUESTION:

That's all that —

had when did it get final approval?

MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, it received approval
approximately, I believe, six or seven months ago#
QUESTION: So the rule of the Association wouldn't
apply to this case, would it,?
MR® WRIGHT: What rule is that., Your Honor?
QUESTION:

I'm sorry®

That you can't bs admitted unless you are

eligible to be readmitted to the school that you wera let out
Of o

MR, WRIGHT:

Well, Your Honor, the situation is, as

in the performance cr the evaluation of final action as far
as the dismissal of the student, the Dean very readily pointed
out to the coordinating committee, which is in the record,
the fact that this student was free to apply for readmission
to this school.
I reserve
QUESTION:

Mr. Wright.

MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor?
You stated that there's no right in

Missouri to a medical education.

I think we could accept that.,

certainly as sun® it for the moment.

Is the situation changed

after the medical school .accepts an individual for admission
to the medical school?
MR. WRIGHT:

At least there As soma expectation **No, Your Honor, —

23
QUESTION:

~ cf graduating, isn’t there?

MR. WRIGHT:
situation changes.

Ycur Honor, I do not feel that the

Undoubtedly the student is closer to

becoming a medical doctor.

But the admission to the school

means that the student is entitled to be treated in the same
manner as other students in that institution.
QUESTION s

But might not that sometimes present a

question as to whether or not the student is so treated?
MR. WRIGHT:

Your Honor, that question arose in this

case.
QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. WRIGHT: The allegations were very specific in
this area, and the finding was specifically that there was no
disparat» treatment between students and the institution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, if she had graduated, would

she automatically have been eligible to practice medicine, or
would she have had -to tales a further examination of some kind?
Something in the record suggests graduation qualifies

Very well,

Mr, Benson,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A, BENSON II, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, BENSON?

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court?
The respondent, Charlotte Horowitz, in this case was
admitted to the medical school with Petitioners' specific
knowledge, in the fa.ll of 197.1 as an advanced-standing student.
And at that, time it is correct -that sha was expected to
graduate within approximate.:,/ two year -, although the evidence
in tho record, appearing •at pagos 87 and 38 of the testimony,
is that 'that was tlv: bare minimum of times which it. would
require her to grade ate, .because she did: not have the extensive
medical background that some of her classmates admitted as
advanced-standing had, such as having completed a degree in
oral ■v' surgery,
Th© two years w,*s a bare minimum when she was
admitted t.a this medical school,

M, tho tins she was admitted to the madic&i school,
uirements for graduation, it was not

25
specified, ami the parties have stipulated to this, ia
Stipulation 92 that appears at page 25 of 'die Appendix, that
tiiar® was no particular number of courses that, had feo b© passed
in order to graduates, and that there was no particular number
©f courses which, if failed, would result in dismissal.
The parties h&v® also stipulated, in Stipulation Mo,
29 at pag© 12, that this student passed every single course by
receiving a satisfacitote grade in every course up until May
1, 1973, at the time the committees finally determined she
would not, graduate.
In addition, the term "satisfactory completion of
the course" la defined by stipulations of the? parties, it's
Stipulation 82 on page 23, as meaning that this st.ud.ont had
met tha standards of acceptable performance by students at this
schoolc,
So, at. th® time she had virtually completed her
two years at th© medical school she had passed every singl©
course by receiving & satisfactory grads, and had been so

informed.
It is apparent:

She had *»“
QUESTION: That’s one of th© elements in fchu raedicnl

26
i

MRc BENSON s
clinical rotations.

Yes „ The courses she took included
For instance, pediatrics was a rotation

which sh© took, which included clinical exposure to sick
children as well as to the healthy children? ar<d she received
a satisfactory grade for that, and it was communi cate d to her.
But, at the same time she was completing that course
and during that course, some of the faculty were adversely
evaluating her performance and were documenting their beliefs
‘that her performance was somewhat less than satisfactory,
i

end yet,, from the record, it’s clear that sh© never saw those
evaluations until after this litigation was commenced, and
they were produced in discovery? she did not know that it had
bean deemed by some of her professors that sh© had, although
receiving a satisfactory grade, had nob satisfactorily enough
completed those courses.
Sho did know, however, that she was having some
difficulty in clinical competence.

This first that she learned

'vs--: th-s July 5, 1972, lafcfesr placing fcr.r on probation.

Thai

letter, which appears in £h© Appendix it page ISO, however,
reflects only a concern about her relationships with other
persons.

And then with regard to the clinical aspect of that,

states that in order i.o improve her. relationships with other
persons she he-scls to begin keeping to established schedules,
and msavrag ail clinical ;raaponsibilltiles on time and grace*”
fully.

27

Now f we'r© still not: certain as to what: "meeting a
clinical responsibility grace fully” means, but: that was the
first: reference to some allegation that she was somehow
deficient; in clinical abilities.
QUESTION:

Mr. Benson* assuming that, a medical

school or any otiler school said that "in order to graduate
you must have a passing grad® in ©very subject that you take" ?
is thera anything wrong with that?
MR. BENSON %

No.

I'm sura many schools do.

QUESTION: Well* if -they had that at this school* —
do they?
MR. BENSON*

No* they did not.

The parties

stipulated* Stipulation No. 92, that they did not.
QUESTION: That they did not have to fake them* but
did they s&y they had to pass?
MR. BENSON:

No.

The stipulation, X believe, on page 25, is that
*11*3 policies and regulations of the Medical School do not
state th® xequlrrmsnts foe graduation in terms of the
successful completion of any number" and it should ba "ior
percentage of courses, nor do th® policies of the Medical
School specify that students should not; be graduated for not
having succi-tfs fully completed a course or courses."

factory" or "no credit" ~~ having gotten the highest grade
that she could receive for ~~

require passing in ©very subject.- you wouldn't be here?
MR. BENSON: Well, no, that's not quits right,
because •—*
QUESTION;

Well, if you don't, you're going to upset

a whole of schools in this country„
MR. BENSON:

Well, our allegation is that, when &

professional graduate school, where the student is in the
school that was aimed

a clear and a particular fi?ld, «ad

that school slams the door in the face of that .student's being
ablrj to get into that professional field, that that is a fore­
closure of a full range of employment opportunities, which
this Court has in. tfe-a past, in similar circumstances, and should
in this caro require a due process hearing*
QUESTION:

Mr. Benson.-, you say that graduation —» or

for kie}d.iig.scmoiody outin affect, of a professional graduate;
school foreclc-oos employ n- ont opportunities *

But surely that

29
forecloses fewer professional opportunities then being flunked
out of colleges

being flunked out of collega forecloses

fewer than being flunked out of, high school.

It seems to me

that if we were to adopt your question, your proposition, w®
would be left with the proposition that there's a duo process
hearing for flunking finyosie out of any public educational
institution.
MR. BENSON:

Well, I believe that would be correct,

and I don't believe that should be an impediment to adopting
such a ruling. Because in Goss vs. Lopez this Court has required
fiu© process hearings for clearly disciplinary reasons.
whoa

Now,

if the Court; agrees that there is a foreclosure of a

rang© of professional or employment opportunities, then a due
process hearing is required? but- the format to that du
process hearing can bo determined by the institution within
the guidelines of Matthews vs. Eldridgs decision of -this Court?
and in the ar&mpba that you gave a student who flunks some
course in history in an undergraduate college night find dueprocess requirements satisfied simply by a letter from the Dean
indicating that, the student had failed courses A, B and C,
and that if the student differed with that finding that he
could appear in -he Dean's office on Friday at 1:30 and, if
they'd like to see the records, they could ask in advance for
them to be produced.

And he would haves a hearing with Idle raeru

I b@li.eve that would sufice, and many educational

30

limitations do that informally or formally now throughout
the nation»

And so requiring a due process hearing before

the student, is expelled would note place any substantial burden
upon any of the educational institutions»
In a professional graduate situation, however, the
du@ process hearing undas Matthews vs. Eldrldg® type csf test
might b® somewhat more involved.

QUESTION;

Unless there's one of ‘those three

deprivations, —

at all

MR. BENSON:

That's right»

QUESTION:

the du® process clause is not implicated

33
MR. BENSONs

Well, I believe in tills case that she

primarily has bean deprived of her liberty interest: in pursuing
her chosen career, a common occupation of life in the medical
profession.

I believe that's been clearly established by?

one, the fact t±iat she had a job at the North Carolina Medical
School, Department of Psychiatry, contingent upon receiving
th® degree from the school.
When she did not get the degree from the school, she
lost ‘the job at North Carolina.

That's a clear foreclosure of

&a employmant opportunity, which ia of record. And, secondly,
Dr. Cohen testified in his expert and uncontrovertad testimony
that the student was virtually precluded from ever again
obtaining admission to any other medical school, or finding
employment ia medically related fields.

A clear deprivation

of her liberty interest in employment.
Now, withi&gard to the property interest, X believe
that is secondary, but nonetheless important, because at the
tin® she ~ufeerec the school she had, I believe, a reasonable
axpootatioB of an entitle! rest to a degree if she would meet
th© requirements of the school.

Now, the school hers did not

spall ©"•••' its requirements for graduation.

34
QUESTION: Right»
MR. BENSON:

Now, there?1 s a difference between not

being graduated and being disraissed from the school.

Because

at the time she was told that she would not be graduated, there
was the expectation that she would be continuae, in school for
an additional length of time.

The school called that

deceleration ~~
QUESTION t Deceleration.
MR. BENSON:

-« and other students were decelerated.

In fact, she was specifically told that the committees would
meet at some later time to determine whether or not she would
b© continued in school or dismissed,

find in May of 1973, the

decision was made that, after this reviewing procedure, that
no new information had bean, presented, and the school would
stand by

its decision not to graduate her.
Than, at the end of that month, a whole new sat of

•>

hearings w-sre held, without knowledge to her, without an
opportunity to attend, at which it was decided she would be
dismissed from the school.

and so she was placed or, notice

that she would not graduate, but she was never placed on
notice '.hah she would be dismissed from the school,

QUESTION i

Mr. Benson, —

QUESTION; What was ignored by the medical school?

MR. BENSONt
The judgments of the medical school, a
majority of them, at least four, recommended either that she
graduate on schedule or that she be continued oil probation.
Four of the seven recommended, one of those two options. Ana yet

that recommendation was ignored, and she was —• she was dis­

But ti»® major deficiency is that she never had an
opportunity to appear . be fora fchss Coordinating Committas, which
was the commi,ttas which was making the decision as to whether
or not she should b© graduated or not.

And she had no oppor­

tunity to appear before that committee, armed with the allega­
tions against her, knowledge of them, notice of them, and with
an opportunity to rebut; them.
And she had no opportunity to argue before that
committee the circumstances that would characterize her
conduct —

that's your position?
MR* BENSONs Well, in this case it is, for two
reasons, because the majority opinion of the — the recommenda­
tion, of the seven examining physicians was ignored, and because
the procedure of the school, in establishing that process of
examination, was ale© ignored, in_ that the seven examining
physicians were not called together to discuss their opinions
and to resolve differences„
So, in that respect, she was denied procedural
due process because the school failed to follow its own rules*
