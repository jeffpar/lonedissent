ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL H. KAPLAN ON BEHALF
OF PETITIONER
MR. KAPLAN;
Court;

Mr. Chief Justice» may it please the

This case concerns several issues regarding alleged

racial discrimination in hiring and recruiting -under various
civil rights laws» principally Title VII»1964 Civil Rights
Act.

More particularly» this case brings into focus questions

relating to (!) what constitutes legitimate nondiscriminatorv
reasons for refusing to hire minority applicants
McDorme11-Donglas;

under

(2) the standard of review to be applied

by a court of appeals after a district court has found
an employer's refusal to hire i>rere legitimate and nondiscriminatory, and» also» the court of appeals3 authority litres trained
by either the evidence in the record or the district court
findings to create its own hiring system?

(3)

it deals with

the use and probative value of statistics by defendant in
Title VII eases» and particularly whether under Title VII a
hiring process which resulted in the hiring of black bricklayers
far in excess of their statistical availability in the
relative labor market can be fragmented into its various

4
subparts, and, finally, raises the issue of whether dis­
criminatory intent or motive are essential elements to a prima
facie case of disparate treatment under McDonnell-Pouglas.
The genesis of this case is the relining of a blast
furnace by Furnco at Interlake, Inc., in the late summer and
early fall of 1971.

Performing this work, Furnco hired fire-

bricklayers, a very unique bricklaying craft.

The exigencies

confronting Furnco in performing this work in terras of the
speed it had to perform it in, in terms of the quality of the
work, that had to be performed, and the risks of doing it in
an untimely or improper manner are set forth at length in our
brief and also in the district court5 s findings and need not
be recounted here.
In meeting these needs, Furnco through its job
superintendent followed three fundamental hiring policies!
First, it only hired bricklayers known by the superintendent
or recommended to him as such to be experienced and highly
competent in this unique skill of bricklaying.

It essentially

hired firebricklayers with a proven track record of skill and
ability.
Second, it did not accept applications from anyone.
It did not hire at the gate.

It is undisputed that neither

blacks nor whites were hired at the gate.
QUESTION:

Out of the firebricklayers known to

the superintendent, the two blacks on the list known to him

5
.were not hired?
MR„ KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
MR» KAPLAN:

That's not true, your Honor»
That's not true?
That's not true.

think you are referring to both the amici

It is alleged — I
and the respondents,

the point that Mr» Samuels and Mr. Smith were not hired»
The first point, in tine reply brief we point out
. at length that Donald Samuels had never worked for Dacies»
There is a question in there by myself, '’Have you ever worked
for Mr» Dacies?"

Answer:

"No, I have not."

So he had never

worked for Dacies»
The second gentleman, Mr» William Smith, was hired
on this job,
QUESTION:

But after other white people who weren't

on the list?
MR, KAPLAN:

No, your Honor.

The evidence shows

that Mr. Smith had worked for Mr. Dacies previously and that
at one point Mr. Dacies had met Mr. Smith at the .job site and
said words to the effect, "Smitty, what are you doing here?
Go home»

I am going to hire you„"
The evidence shows that Mr. Smith was hired in a

nondiscriminatory sequence of hiring.

He was hired before

white bricklayers: for example, he was hired before seven
white bricklayers who were purportedly on this list and worked
longer than 11 white bricklayers who were purportedly on this

6
list.
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

But he was not on the list»
Well, I think the list is really a

red herring in this particular case.
persons who were known by Dacies.

The list signified

Mr. Dacies had Mr. Smith's

nans in his head rather than on a piece of paper, and. he was
hired because he knew Dacies, and he was hired in a manner
that was not dissimilar to the way white bricklayers were
hired.
In that regard, the evidence showed that blacks
worked on the average the same number of days as white
bricklayers and were hired throughout the whole sequence of
the job.
The third policy pursued by Furnco in hiring on
this job was that it sought to recruit and hire black brick­
layers who ware experienced and skilled in firebrick in
numbers substantially in excess of their statistical presence
in the relevant labor force.
The district court found and the evidence showed
that during the relevant time period 5.7 percent of the
bricklayers in the relevant labor market were black.

On the

Interlake job, Furnco worked black bricklayers 13.3 percent
of the man-days.

Essentially black bricklayers worked on this

job at two and a half times their availability in the labor

force.

7
QUESTION;

Mr. Kaplan, I am going to foe sure I

understand your answer to Justice Rehnguist’s question.

Are

you saying that Smith and Samuels were on the list or that
there was no list?
MR. KAPLAN;

I am saying Samuels had never worked

for Dacies.
QUESTION;

I understand.

MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Smith.

Take Smith.
The list were various

scraps of paper that Mr. Dacies kept that contained the names
of various bricklayers
in firebrick.

he held worked with who were skilled

Mr. Smith's name v;as not on that list, it was

not on a scrap of paper.

However, Mr. Smith

was known by

Mr. Dacies and he was hired because he was known by Mr. Dacies.
To get right to that issue, then, of the list, which
seems to be kind of all-pervasive in this case, the all-white
list is a very catchy slogan.

It is wholly unrelated to this

case, it's a red herring.
QUESTION;

Is it correct that there were writings

on pieces of paper and only names of white persons were on
those writings?
MR. KAPLAN;

That is true.

However, prior to the

job Mr. Dacies was instructed by the company general manager
to make sure that black bricklayers were hired on this job in
numbers substantially in excess of their availability in the
S®sr. Sagies wanted new black bricklayers prior

8
to this job and prior to the job contacted another Furnco
superintendent in the area to obtain the names of other black
bricklayers ,
QUESTION:

Is there any explanation of why he didn’t

write his narae down?
MR, KAPLAN:

There is none.

He was never asked

that question, your Honor,
The critical point is that prior to the job, prior
to the hiring of bricklayers on this job, Mr, Dacies had the
names of black and white bricklayers.
integrated pool.

He was hiring from an

And by hiring from this integrated pool, the

evidence shows that he was able to accomplish an integrated
work force, integrated in terms of days worked, in terns of
numbers hired, in terras of every conceivable way.
One additional point.

There is no showing that this

white list, this purported white list, was the exclusive
avenue for obtaining work on this job.

It was only one of

several recruitment sources used by the job superintendent in
hiring on this job.

And the very fact that blacks were hired
/

in the numbers they were evidences that fact, that'fe it was not
exclusive.

Being on the list was not a prerequisite to being

hired.
QUESTION:

Were any whites hired who were not on

tfea list?
MR, KAPLAN:

Yes,

One, who was recommended — there

9

were two people recommended by persons working on the job,, one
white was.
As I was noting, the district court had found that
the hiring policies we pursued on this job were legitimate and
nondiscriminatory and had ruled in our favor against all eight
plaintiffs„

The court of appeals reversed as to three and

affirmed as to five.

The court of appeals in doing so

completely ignored the legitimate and nondiscriminatory nature
of Furnco'js hiring on this job, and its decision is totally at
odds with the evidence before the district court.

It also

chose to ignore the statistics in this case demonstrating the
absence of racial discrimination.
This Court has often said that in racial discrimina­
tion cases statistics tell much.

Here they tell that Furnco's

hiring policies were nondiscriminatory,
QUESTION:

I suppose an employer could, in a market

where there were 20 percent blacks in the pool, have employed
30 percent and nonetheless if a black came to him and sought
employment and the employer told the black, ”1 am}not going to
hire you because you are black," the fact that he was above
the pool ratio would not excuse him,
MR, KAPLAN:
case here.

I understand that.

That’s not the

The case is whether or not you can infer racial

discrimination from what is going on,

I think what statistics

say, that in the absence of such blatant kinds of purposeful

10
discrimination, no blacks need apply —there was no sign that
blacks need not apply --

that in the absence of such direct

evidence, statistics tell you what is the environment in which
hiring and employment decisions are being made*

And I suggest

that the statistics in this case tell that the environment
in which the hiring was going on was not that Furnco was
discriminating against blacks, but that Furnco was purposely
seeking blacks out, purposely trying to recruit blacks.

And

this is bast evidenced, I think, by the statistics —
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t he have been much batter off if

he had a list of -those blacks?
MR. KAPLAN:

I don’t, think that makes a difference,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

He. did have a list of the laborers.

MU. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

But the point is -It would have been one thing if he had

an integrated list, but sine© he had a white list, wouldn't it
have been better if he had also had —
MR, KAPLAN:

I don't think it would have made a

difference in this case.

I mean, certainly tho form of it

would have ~ well, he has got an integrated list, that looks
nicer.

But the form of it would make no difference

The point is that blades were hired early on in this
job and hired throughout the period of the job.

evidence that they ware disparately treated in terms of the

So their absence from the list

It is not a matter of substance of racial

QUESTION:

Mr» Kaplan, let rne just follow up if I

I don4t mean to suggest this is what the facts show

. because the facts are quite confused in this case.

But

assume that the evidence did show that the company hired what
it regarded was an appropriate quota of blacks and it
thought it had met its affirmative action obligation or
something of that nature.

Then thereafter it would be obligated,

with the remaining people it hired to take blacks and whites
indiscriminately, would it not?
MR. KAPLAN:

§,

What is your position?

I don't think that is really the —

position.

(

I just want to get your legal
■

Assume that you did affirmatively hire, say, 15, 20,

whatever the percentage might be, and got that number of black
workers on the job.

Having done that, and say you have another

80 percent to hire, would it be your view that you could then
say, "We will hire only whites in the other 80 percent'"?

12
MR. KAPLAN:

No.

Not at all.

QUESTION;

I sea.

QUESTION:

Would you be taking a risk if you did

of having an attack made by the 80 percent that you were
discriminating and using a quota system?
MR. KA'PLAN:

Well, I would think that there would

be a grave risk in that regard.

But the point is that,

really, what we are talking about in those cases is a selection
that we are selecting people solely because of their skin
color.

And I think what is occurring here is recruitment of

blacks and whites and bringing them into a pool and then taking
bricklayers out of the pool.
QUESTION:

Wasn0t the important thing to you in

this case that you donst have to hire at the gate?
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And isn’t the important thing to you to

v'*

sustain this case as though the list weren’t there at all?
MR. KAPLAN;
QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct, your Honor.
And then if you lose the'case on these

two just because there was a. list, that isn't such a big deal
for you, is it?
MR. KAPLAN:

Oh, it's a. big deal that even one of

them was discriminated against, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But if they weren't discriminated against

because the company doesn't have any obligation to hire at the

13
gate and can have this key-man selection system, so to speak,
that's one thing.

But if the only reason they were dis­

criminated against is because the foreman had a list on which
there were no blacks, that may be important to you, but it
doesn't undermine —
MR. KAPLAN:

Undermine the essence of the hiring

system.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KAPLAN:

That9 s correct, your Honor.

But I

want to go back to that list and particularly again Samuels
never worked for Dacies and his exclusion from Dacies' mind or
list is obvious because he had never worked for him.
Mr. Smith had worked for Dacies previously.

Mr.

Dacies meets Mr. Smith at the job site and says, "Smitty, go
home, I'm going to hire you.”

And he hires him, and he hires

him, as the evidence shows, as part of a nondiscriminatory
sequence of hiring.

There is no showing that Mr. Smith should

have been the first person hired, and if he didn't have to be

K

the first person hired, when did he have to be hired?
I suggest the evidence shows that blacks were
hired throughout the period of the job, and that makes all the
difference in the world.

Mr. Smith was not hired at the end

of the job because he was black.
on.

There were blacks hired early

He was just hired toward the end of the job because that

was the way it happened.

14
QUESTION:

Is there an issue in this case that even

if there hadn't been a list, that you were discriminatory , your
client x/as discriminatory?
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Well —
Is there gin argument —

MR, KAPLAN:

Apparently there is some argument

made about our refusal to hire at the gate is discriminatory
or refusal to take applications is discriminatory.

I don't

believe they raise any issues of discrimination for the very
basic reason that there is no showing of disparate racial
impact here.

On the contrary, the evidence points in exactly

the opposita direction.
QUESTION:

Does it make any difference that this

finding by the district court differed from that of the court
of appeals* that .it's the court of appeals that undertook to
superimpose its findings on the record over the district court?
MR. KAPLAN:

I think what was going on here, your

Honor, is that the court of appeals did not apply a proper
standard of review, and in fact applied no standard of review;
\

rather, created its own hiring system and created facts that
were not in existence.

For example, -they say that, "We see

nothing in the record to show that our hiring system that we
created out of thin air isn't feasible."
Well, the point of the matter is that every single
person who testified with any experience as a mason contractor

15
said that they would have hired the way we hired, and there was
no evidence whatsoever that their "feasible system" was in fact
feasible, that anybody had ever built a blast furnace that way.
One of the two — to make the point about the
statistics in this case, and that is in the impact of the
statistics here, using the Castaneda and Hazelwood methodology,
the statistics show the blacks were hired at 14 standard
deviations greater than the expected nuraber.

Mow, that doesn’t

show purposeful discrimination? it shows purposeful bringing
blacks in.
Back to the all-whit® list for a moment.

Concentra­

ting on the all-white list is wrong not only because there was
an integrated pool prior to the job, but it also represents
an attempt to fragment and parse the hiring process, to look
at each individual source of hiring and saying,"What is the
racial, ethnic, sexual, religious composition of that?" rather
than looking at the results of the entire hiring process.

I

suggest that that kind of parsing up is not only inconsistent
with case law but leads to ludicrous results, that no employer
in this country would

have a hiring system that didn’t

discriminate if that ware fch® rule.

It would b© impossible

to have any source that precisely reflected that kind of
protected category makeup.

Indeed, there is no evidence to

show that the hiring system found "feasible” by the court of
appeals or urged by the court of appeals would have passed

16

muster under that kind of standard.
The fatal defects of the court of appeals8 system
is that there is no showing that it would have created job
opportunities for blacks in excess of what our system created.
In fact, the evidence is exactly the opposite, that if you had
a completely random system, as the court of appeals seemed to
say we needed, that only 5.7 percent of the man-days on the
job would have been worked by blacks instead of our 13.4 percent.
QUESTION:

Is that a sufficient answer to a Title VII

claim, if an employer refuses a black a job specifically on the
ground that he is black, for him to say, "Look, X'ra already 20
percent over the pool"?
MR. KAPLAN;

I agree with you, that is not a

sufficient answer where ha says, CfX am not going to hire you
because you are black.”
QUESTIONS
kind of cases?

But that's not the ease her©.

Don't you have two basically different

One is the Griggs case where you are talking

about disparate impact, and fch© other is the McDonnell-Douglas
where you are talking about racially motivated refusal to hire?
MR. KAPLAN:

That83 right.

Now, the court) of
!

appeals said this case fell under McDonnell-Douglas.
so, it made, I think, two fatal errors,

.

In doing

first of all, in

saying there was ever a prima facie case of discrimination in
the first placa.

I think what McDonnell-Douglas says is how

were similarly situated whites treated?

And the answer is

17
similarly situated whites who appeared at the gate seeking
employment -~
QUESTIONs

Blacks ?

QUESTION:

No, white s.

MR. KAPLAN:

No, similarly situated whites.

there disparate treatment?

Was

And the evidence showed that whites

appearing at the job site gate did not get jobs.

So there was

never a prima facie showing of discrimination in that sens©.
Nor is there a showing of discrimination —
QUESTION:

Didn't the court of appeals say that

a hiring scheme hiring only employees known to the superinten­
dent was too fraught with potential for discrimination to ba
permissible?
MR. KAPLAN:

It may have hecsn fraught with dis\

crimination —
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

Did they hold that?
What they said is that a subjective

if$ ring system lends itself to discrimination.
tmo difficulties with that:

Now, there were

One, that there is no evidence in
X

this case of discrimination, and the cases of this Court and
all the other courts are that you may have a subjective hiring
4f-stam as long as it doesn't result —
QUESTION:

Suppose there had been no petition for

certiorari, and you are operating under the court of appeals6
judgment and its opinion.

/

Could you have maintained this system

18
without a list so-called?

Could you? after the court of

appeals'* opinion, just told your superintendent to go ahead
and hire but be fair?
MR. KAPLANs
was fair.

I think our hiring in the first place '

The question is whether we would have had to taka

applications at the gate.
QUESTION:

That is what I am asking you, under the

court of appeals' opinion.
MR. KAPLAN:

Under the court of appeals5 decision

we would have had to take applications at the gate.
QUESTION:

So there is an issue here.

You are

attacking that, I taka it.
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

That we did not ~~

I suppose the other side is defending

that.
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

That is absolutely correct.
So there must be an issue here, then.
There is.

The question relating

prior thereto was to the list, your Honor.

There is no showing

that if we had hired at the gats that it would have resulted
in the same? kind of nondiscriminatory hiring we in fact had
on this job.
We are talking about the fragmenting of tbs hiring
system.

It seems to me that Title VII does not prescribe that

there were good hiring systems and bad hiring systems in terms

19
of the kinds of ways

you recruit workers.

It doesn't say you

have to go to help wanted ads or TV advertising or write
letters to every potential applicant.

It says whether or not

the sources that you choose, the recruitment sources you use,
whether or not those are discriminatory or nondiscriminatory f
whether or not they have a disparate impact on blacks or any
other protected minority.
And the answer in this case is that the selection
of recruitment sources that we chose did not have such a
disparate impact and that to fragment and parse up the system
totally distorts the hiring process.
One of the points also raised in the certiorari
petition that I would like to comment on for a moment is -the
question of whether intent or motive are a necessary element
to a prima faci© case under McDonnall-Douglas,

I believe that

such a showing is necessary to show that there is a nexus
between the prohibited criteria and the action taken, that
there is a nexus between refusing to hire a black and the fact
that you are refusing to hire him on that prohibited basis,
I think that the shewing of intent and motive are
a necessary element of th® most analogous statute, which is
the National Labor Relations Act.
QUESTION:

But obviously in order to prove intent

or motive, it's almost inevitably necessary to rely on
circumstantial evidence..

20

MR. KAPLAN;

That6s right»

And what I am suggesting

here is the circumstantial evidence in this case completely
dispels any notion that persons were not hired because of their
skin color.

And that evidence against is not only the

statistics and the nondiscriminatory sequence of hiring, but
also the treatment of blacks on the job.

No discriminatory

discharges, layoffs, no denial of benefits, nothing of that
nature.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kaplan, going back to hiring at the

gate point, I am just trying to remember, does the evidence
tell us when a man applied at the gat®, he was told, "We don't
take applications at the gat©»" did the company tell him how
he should apply?
MR» KAPLAN;

Mr. Daeies, who was the superintendent,

didn't talk to anybody at th© gat© other than Smith.

People just

went up to th© gate and they were in a senses locked out.
QUESTION;

Was there any procedure for letting them

know who they should write to or anything like that?
MR. KAPLAN:

No, for the simple reason we did not

take applications from anybody.
QUESTION;

Except when Smith showed up, Daeies said,

"Smithy" —
MR» KAPLAN:

"Go home.,55

It wasn't really an

court credited that testimony.

21
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Miner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H. MINER ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. MINER:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

The issue of this all-white list is not a red herring

in this case.

That is precisely why this lawsuit was brought.

This company has for years hired through Mr. Dacies.

Mr.

Dacies is a white superintendent who has run jobs and worked
on jobs.

He has worked with whites

and blacks, competent

whites and competent blacks, since 1958, and he never put a
black man on his list.

And he used that list not to fill

isolated jobs, but to fill, in this instance, 90 percent of
the jobs.

According to his testimony he used it to fill every

job except in these instances where his boss said, BOn this
job, Mr. Dacies, you must hire some percentage of blacks.”
In that instance, he went out and recruited some blacks to fill
some jobs by alternative methods.
It’s not a small, little practice.

It is the

practice that this man testified he used to fill all the jobs.
He testified he could do it that way because he had ample names
on his list and that this work was so lucrative that he had
no trouble going out and recruiting people to come and work
for him.
There are three basic facts in this case.

Number

one, the plaintiffs in this case are fully qualified and

22

competent bricklayers.

They are men who have worked in this

industry from between 18 and 30 years.

Consequently, all of

the discussion in defendant"» briefs about the skills necessary
to perform this kind of work doesn't apply to these plaintiffs
because they are skilled.

They'simply want the opportunity

to use those skills on jobs run by Furnco.
Secondly, there is not a piece of evidence in this
record that a single bricklayer hired on this job was as
qualified or more qualified than the blacks who were seeking
work at this time.
QUESTION:
MR. MINER:

This isn't a class action,
No.

It is an individual action brought

by those blacks who sought to get on this particular job.
And the man selected to run this job was Mr.
Dacies.

He had unfettered discretion as to who he would hire

and how he would hire for all but those limited number of jobs
for which he was ordered to hire some number of blacks.
It's apparent from this record that the blacks that
were hired coma only from two sources:

Number one,- he called —

he testified that, he got on the job and he was told to hire
soma blacks.

He told his boss, “I don't know the telephone

numbers of any blacks? therefore I called Mr. Urbanski on
*

-

another job Furnco was running.”

Mr. Urbanski said, '"I'll see

if I have some who can do the work,” and Mr. Urbanski subsequently
sent him soma names

23
NOW; Mr. Daeies .

or Furnco, in their reply brief,

tells as that these are examples of people that Daeies knew
and that he hired because he knew them, and they give us three
examples.
that8s

They tell us that's

Mr. Branch, they tell us

Mr. Jones, and that's Mr. Smith.

As to those three

people, the record shows that Mr. Jones testified that ha was
never called by Daeies.

Ee had a telephone call one night

from his superintendent on the other job and they said, "You
better get over to the Interlake job tomorrow," and he reported
to work the next day.

Nobody disputed that testimony.

No

supervisor of Mr. Jones disputed that testimony.
Mr. Branch isn't a bricklayer.
a gunite

man.

He is what is called

There is nothing in the record as to why Mr.

work on

As to Mr. Smith, as we will show in our argument,
ha was not selected with the whites who were on Mr. Daeies*
list.

Thirty-seven whites who had not sought work on this job

were put to work befor© Mr. Smith.
QUESTION;

Is it your position the company must

take applications*5
MR. MINER §

No.

It is our position that a company

that has — we cannot look at the application end of it in
isolation.

A company that has systematically excluded blacks

fro® it® psinftfy source of employees must provide some

24
alternative for minority people to make their credentials
known„
QUESTION:

So I suppose your answer is at least

Furnco must — after the court of appeals9 opinion anyway
would be required, and your position is it must take applica­
tions .
MR. MINER:

Let me just define perhaps at the moment

what this hiring at the gat© was.

When I say take applications?

I would say yes? if taking applications means offering some
alternative so that minority people can demonstrata that they
have all the skills requisite to do this kind of work.

That is

not to say —
QUESTION:

You say that any company that ..gives its

superintendent carte blanche authority to just go out and hire
its work force, they

tell him, "We need 100 persons, now go

out and hire them,” and he just hires from people that he
knows , it

just so happens that he hires 10 Negroes out of 100.,

you would say that.6s an invalid system.
MR. MINERs

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H, MINER ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
QUESTION;
MR, MINER;

What

(RESUMED)

was the question?

1 believe the question was whether a

company had turned over hiring to a superintendent and he in
fact hired in a fair manner that resulted in a

10 percent

black labor force, but they didn't accept applications, whether
•die refusal to take applications was legitimate,

I assume

\

the question is that 10 parcent is a representative population.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MINER;

Our position would be no.

What makes

die refusal to accept applications improper is the fact that
the other si da of the coin is an intentionally discriminatory
mechanism that has historically excluded blacks —
QUESTION;

Do you think the court ©f appeals would

agree with your answer?
MR, MINER;

Yes, because 1 think what the court of

appeals said is contained on, I think itcs page 6 of the
appendix.
is,

It’s in on© paragraph.

And what that paragraph says

In light of historical discrimination, in light of historical

26
unequal treatment of blacks

and 1 think they must have meant

by Dacies* because that is the only evidence in this record —
.a practice is prima facie racial discrimination if it refuses
to consider minority job seekers when the alternative is to
hire off an all-white discrirainatorily created list»
QUESTION:

The court of appeals gave this answer

13 years after the enactment of Title VII»

Do you think it

would be entitled to give the same answer* say* 23 years
afterwards?
MR. MINERi

If this job had bean initiated in 1981*

and in 1981 the evidence was that Mr, Dacies had worked from
1958 to 1981 without a singla — with blacks and whites* and
his list was all white* and it was in 1981 that his boss said*
"Now start hiring blacks,"
QUESTION?

But h© doesn’t hire only whites,

MR, MINER?

Ha hired only whites off his list and

90 percent
QUESTION?

But he hired blacks and whites.

MR. MINER?

That’s right* but there are two segments

of -this hiring process.

and blacks off somebody else8s list.

Can the whites sue the other fellow?
You hav© that case before you right now.

2 think there would just be a whole number of factors ‘that go
into determining whether the ~QUESTION;

Suppos® ha did hire whites off his list

and blacks off somebody else5s list?
MR. MINER?

If what he had done was either abolish

the intentionally discriminatory practice —
QUESTIONS
MR» MINERs

Which was what?
Which was the creation and use for at

least 90 percent of the jobs of an all-white list, or he had
integrated the pool, in other words, he had created an
opportunity for minority people to get their names before him
and in some representative number so that indeed he now had a
totally integrated and properly constituted pool, then we would
have a different case.

But w© don't have that»

What we have

is, we have a case where 90 parcent of the jobs were filled
by the superintendent off his all-white list and 10 percent of
the jobs are filled from other superintendents9 —
QUESTION:

Suppose Dacies has a list of 100 whites

and his boss gives him a. list of 100 blacks and he says, ”We
need 100 people, now go out and hire ‘them»
off this list and the whites off that list»”

Hire the blacks
And he went

ahead and did it»
MR» MINER:

If the effect of that was indeed to

absolish the practice, was to totally integrate the pool of
people from whom the selections were being made, among whom the

28
selections were being made? you would have a different problem.
But that isn't what happened here.

What in fact happened was
f

h® had an all-white list that was used to fill a significant
percentage of the jobs.

His boss said? "Fill 1.0 percent of
*

your jobs with these minority people,65 so they integrated the
work fores? but there is no evidence that they integrated in
any way the process that went into the filling of those jobs.
QUESTJQHs

How do you reconcile what you are saying

now with the figures? the statistical factors in this case?
What I hear you saying makes me think I read a different
record than the on® that I should have read.

How about the

record in this case of actual hiring?
MR. MINER:

The record in this case is that there

were three phases of hiring.

There was hiring that went on

prior to end of September 1971? and in that period of time?
according to Mr. Dacies* testimony? he filled 37 —QUESTION:

What about this particular job that wa

are —
MR, MINER:

On this job the first segment? through

the end of September? he hires 41 bricklayers.

Thirty-seven

of them are whites who he called off his list? four ot them
are blacks who he had come to him through another superintendent
Mr. Urbanski.

One of them is a brother of on© of those fellows.

That's the first phase.
Then we get a tel.©phone call from Mr. Wright, his
/

29

boss, and h© says — according to Mr. Dacies, Wright called him.
and said, "There is going to be some allegation or something,
and here are sias or eight black names»"

tod he hires those

people during the second phase.
And the»; the third phase of the job, after h®
hires them, he reverts to his old practice and fills the last
seven jobs again off his list and they are all white.
So what I am saying is there is nothing that
suggests the practice was either abolished or neutral.

We

do have through the so-called affirmative action program some
blacks being transferred to this job.
QUESTIONS

You are suggesting, then, that any

particular black or indeed all blacks ought to be considered
for every particular position.
MR. MINER?

I am suggesting that certainly blacks

who com© to the job site aid certainly blacks who worked for
Mr. Dacies before and who went to the trouble of coming to
the job site to get on should be considered.

And I am

suggesting that if the alternative to rejecting other blacks
from trying to seek out jobs is to revert to this all-white
intentionally created list, then they have a claim that they,
too, should be considered.
QUESTION;
white list.

The evidence is that he just had a

Is that your basis for saying he was intentionally

discriminatory.

30
MR, MINERs

The evidence is that he*, since 1958,

had worked with competent whites and competent blacks and that
he had never put a black man on his list, and in fact we
asked him if he ever hired a black man prior to 1969, and he
said no.

And then there was some question, it got confusing

as to whether he had hired —- h® claims he hired a black man
on a job in 1969, although at that time he had no blacks on his
list, so if he did hire him, he would have had to hire him at
the gate.
QUESTION:

From a58 to 964 he "was under no obligation

to hire them, was he?
MR. MINER:
that he was.

That’s right.

We are not suggesting

But he worked with blacks at least on two or three

jobs after 1964 and still had never put a competent black man
on his list.
QUESTION:

,
Mr. Miner, are you arguing that the

process, if discriminatory, is all that one must find regardless
of the effect?
MR. MINER:

No.

I think there has to be an effect,

but I think vie have effect in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, let5s assume that instead of ending

up with 13-1/2 percent black, the contractor had said, ”1 want
at least 50 percent black.

Mr. Superintendent, you go ahead

and recruit your force any way you think best so long as you
meet that standard.”

If he had met it in this case with, say,

31
50->50 in terms of racial proportion with a labor market at a
figure of what, 10 percent?
that was very favorable»

So you obviously had an effect

Would you say that was all right or

not?
MR. MINERs

Well, there are two relative analyses.

One is under McDonnell-Douglas.

We are not looking at actual

effect? we are looking at whether there was some unequal treatmenfc.

I would say that if an employer had a device that was

intentionally discriminatory and it excluded qualified blacks
from 50 percent of the jobs, its use for 50 percent of the
jobs is still discriminatory as to blacks who are seeking those
jobs.

Now, if in fact no blacks are available and if in fact

what happened was that they had to go out and recruit to fill
all the jobs, then we would have a different story.

But if in

fact they needed 100 people and 100 blacks came and applied
and they were all qualified and they hired 50 percent, of them
because they were told to have 50 percent blacks, but they
excluded the other 50 percent because their hiring mechanism
excluded blacks, then those 50 percent who ware excluded would
have a claim.
QUESTION;

Even though 300 very highly qualified

white applicants had also applied?
MR. MINER:

Well, I was assuming we were talking

about —
QUESTIONS

You were assuming just all black

32

applicants.
MR„ MINER:

If there are white applicants, -there

becomes a question as to the facts of that particular case,
what is the percentage of blacks and whites, and what evidence
is there that the intentionally discriminatory device is
excluding the blacks, is keeping the blacks off the job site»
QUESTION %
us erroneous?

Are these figures that your friend gave

Did he give us some vzrong figures here today

in his oral argument?
MR» MINER;

Well, the figures, in terms of the

number of people on the job during the first phase of the job,
the number of blacks hired was approximately 10 percent»
is a dispute as to what the relevant labor market is»

There

The

trial court had not permitted us to offer evidence as to what
we thought the relevant labor market was, which was made up of
the

particular bricklayers union.
QUESTION;

what are the findings of the district

court in that respect?
MR, MINER;

The district court adopted data that was

introduced by the defendants after he had rejected our data as
to what the racial composition of the union that was responsible
for that jurisdiction was»
QUESTION;

Do we have to accept the findings of the

district court, or did you bring it as an issue here?
MR» MINER;

Pardon?

33
QUESTION;
MR, MINER;

Did you bring that issue here?
The court of appeals held that the judge

abused his discretion in refusing to consider our evidence,
and therefore in effect set it aside.

But those statistics

were not pertinent to their analysis.

And the reason for that

was that the Seventh Circuit applied a strict MeDonnell-DougXas
analysis, and as this Court has said, in a McDonnell-Douglas
case

statistics aren't controlling, they may be relevant, but

the question \?as Dacies® motive, why was Dacies' list all
white and why did Dacies’ fill 90 percent of those jobs off
his own white list even though during that period Mr. Smith
was there who he has worked with on four separate occasions,
he knows to be fully qualified, other blacks are 'there seeking
work, and he doesn't hire them, he hires 37 whites after Mr.
Smith has come to the job site, and those 37 were all on his
list and none of them had sought work.

And the statistics

of Furnco's hiring as a rdsult of order from the boss doesn't
tell us anything about Dacies' motive.
Another thing that tells us about Dacies5 motive is
Dacies' conduct at the job site.

The evidence there is that

he was evasive to the blacks who came.
he wasn't hiring when he was hiring.

He told blacks that
He never told a single

black that this was not the way —
QUESTION;

As I understand it, your colleague on

the other side seemed to concede that if Dacies had said to

34

one of these fellox^s, E,I am just not ready to hire you yet.
18in just not hiring blacks»

I just don't want to hire any

blacks right now," and turned these people away and went ahead
and hired whites, that kind of intentional discrimination
wouldn't be cured by any kind of proportional hiring»

Do you

understand that?
MR. MINERS
QUESTIONS

That's right.
So is this just an argument than over

whether there is a justifiable inference of an intentional
discrimination in the case?
MR. MINERS

I don't think there is any dispute over ~-

I don't think there is much room for dispute over the
inference.

The fact is that the man, to fch© extent that he

QUESTIONS
MR. MINER;

What did the district court find?
Pardon?
Did the district court find -The district court makes no findings

about the existence of the list.

The district court makes no

findings about any of the elements of the hiring practice.
The district court focuses just on the refusal to hire at the
gate and then makes some conclusory findings ~
QUESTIONS

Did it find there was no intentional

discrimination?
MR. MINER;

I think that the district court's findings

35
simply said that the practice was nondiscriminatory and was
necessary? without getting into any of the elements, the
subsidiary facts that went into the whole hiring practice.
That was glossed over by the trial court? and that’s where
the Seventh Circuit differed.

The Seventh Circuit went to the

specific facts that related to the hiring practice and these
facts were uncontrcverted and were all in -the record and were
not dealt with in the trial? and based on those uncontradicted
facts? they concluded that the real problem was not the no
hiring at 'the gate? but in fact no hiring at the gate was 5usfc
the other side of the coin of the use of the all-white list?
and that, in 90 percent of the cases blacks were turned away
in favor of whites who were on this list because for 20 years
this man had never put a black bricklayer on his list.
QUESTION:

Did the court of appeals itself make the

specific finding that Daciess refusal to hire blacks was
racially motivated?
MR. MINER:

I think they did.

I think what the

Seventh Circuit —
QUESTION:
MR. MINER:

That shouldn’t be a think, question.
In light of the historical discrimina­

tion? what they must mesan in that is Dacies because it’s Dacies
that all the focus.is on.

They don’t? in their opinion? say
ft''

in light of Dacies' intention? there was discrimination.

But

they do talk about in light of the historical discrimination?

36
the refusal to consider these people at the job site,when the
alternative is to hire from an all-white list,is discriminatory.
Wow, I think we are going to read that as referring to Mr.
Dacies, and I would interpret it to say, yes, their practice
is intentional discrimination.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Miner, the district court ■— and I

s,

am looking at finding Wo. 15, on page 2118 — that Furnco's
t

-

hiring policies and practices — and I skip a few words here,

■

this is A18 — were neutral -- and I again skip part of it.
"There is no evidence that these policies and practices either
were a pretext to exclude Negro bricklayers or had a dispropor­
tionate impact or effect on Negro bricklayers."
Now, did the court of appeals conclude and state
that there was no substantial evidence to support those
factual findings?
MR. MINER:

What the Seventh Circuit said was that

those findings don’t deal with the subsidiary facts that went
into the explanation of how that hiring practice worked.

And

looking at those facts, it explained the intricacies of the
hiring practice, which the Seventh Circuit found to be perfectly
clear.

The Seventh Circuit said that they were discriminatory,

that they were not job related and that they did indeed
exclude blacks from
QUESTION:

every job filled off that list.
Was there any specific finding by the

court of appeals that the findings of fact by the district

37

court were not supported by evidence?
MR. MINER
other facts.

%

No.

The Seventh Circuit goes off on

It says these are the relevant facts to the

proper analysis of this case.

This is what the plaintiff has

been focusing on from day one, and these facts are undisputed.
And the district court never deals with those facts.
The district court’s facts — and we spell this out
in our brief — I think are certainly suspect.

The problem

with these facts, there are findings in there that wa argued
were clearly erroneous.

They don’t become relevant to the

Seven’til Circuit’s analysis of the case, but the judge says
that the practice in the industry were such.

The judge objected

himself and excluded evidence throughout the trial as to what
the practice of the industry was,

H© makes a finding that

Dacies5 practice is efficient and effective.

The only question

in the whole trial was a question by me to Mr, Dacies:

Do you

have any reason to believe that your practice is more efficient
or more effective than a neighbor practice?

And the judge

objected for the defendant and he didn’t answer the question.
And then the judge in his findings had a finding that Dacies5
practice is more efficient and more effective than any ether
practice.
So I think in fact -there is some question as to
whether those findings deserve the traditional weight.

But

the Seventh Circuit did not get to that point because in

38

light of their analysis of the problem^ they didn't have to
reverse any of the judge's findings of fact.

They were able

to base it exclusively on uncontradicted facts that were in
the record that explained in detail the hiring practices of
this company.
QUESTION:

But a moment ago you said the court of

appeals at least inferentially found that Dacies' refusal to
employ was racially motivated.
MR. MlNERs
QUESTION s

That8s correct.
And here my brother Powell has pointed

out your finding by the district cotart that it was not
racially motivated, so the court of appeals did have to upset
that finding of the district court in order to justify your
argument.
MR. MINERi

I guess that's right.

There is a

conflict there and I think -that simply goes out from the fact
that the district court just did not weigh any» of the facts
that led to the conclusion that there was a basis for
discrimination, which is the creation and the use of this
list.
QUESTIONS

It seems to be quit© crucial to your

position ‘that there is something wrong and illegal about not
hiring at the gate.
MR. MIHERs

If the other side of the coin is to

fill either all jobs off an intentionally discriminatory device

39
or certainly the majority of those jobs when other jobs were
merely filled because the boss says get a certain number of
blacks in a certain number of these jobs»
QUESTION?

That brings us back to the objective

evidence again on the statistics, doesn't it?

You certainly

have to put those two things together.
MR. MINER;

I don't think so because the question

then is there are two people doing the hiring.

There is Mr.

Dacies who is hiring 90 percent of the people off his list
and there is his boss who is in effect transferring some
number of blacks to the job sit®.

Now, the. overall statistic8*-

may very well tell us a lot about what Furnco’s ultimate
goals are, but they don't tell us anything about Dacies'.

They

don't tell us anything about why Dacies met Mr. Smith at the
job site on the day when this job was starting and he is
under directions to get 16 percent blacks and he doesn't hire
Mr. Smith and he doesn't ask Mr. Smith, . t!Who are these ether
blacks around here, are they competent bricklayers?

I am

supposed to find black bricklayers." Wa asked him why h©
didn't, and he said, "I don't hire at the gat®.”

That’s not

a sincere answer to the problem.

QUESTION:

Right*

MR. MINER:

I would submit there is no evidence

in this record that whites cam© to the gate.

The evidence

in this record is that historically this is the way blacks
have gotten work in this industry*
site to job site*

They have gone from job

The no-hiring-at-the-gate policy is Dacies'.

It is not Furnco's,

Every blaqk in this record, every black

who testified at this trial who had worked the firebrick
industry had only gotten a job because he had gc-.r. to a job
site and he was hired than*

Not one black before this trial

had ever received a telephone call from a superintendent saying,,
"Come on out, Mr* Smith, or Mr. Samuels, l8ve got a job for you,,15
That's hot# blacks got jobs*

It was Dacies who imposed as an

absolute policy the refusal to consider people at the gate*
And the alternative for him in filling 90 percent of the jobs
was his all-white list.

QUESTIONS

When Dacies doss it, it's Furnco's

action, is it not?
MR, MINERS
QUESTIONS

I think so,
Why this separation of Dacies and Furnco?

It's all Furnco, isn’t it* no matter who does it.

If you had

10 different men doing the hiring* if they are all agents and
servants of Furnco* why is that relevant at all?
MR, MINERs
QUESTIONs

Because I think
You may be showing that Mr, Dacies has

some wrong attitudes* but Furnco is the party in interest here,
MR. MINERs
because

But Furnco adopts those attitudes

ifc5s Furnco whose vice president never really

supervised this* never mad© any inquiry as to how Dacies was
hiring.

They testified they had no mechanism for determining

whether In fact Daeies was relying primarily on whites or
whether Daoies8 primary practices would lead naturally to an
integrated work force.

They had given him his head and he

had basically unfettered discretion to hire who fee wanted to,
and consequently I think -they are responsible for his actions.
Mowf in the case of Smith, we submitted that there
was a sl@s.r instance of intentional discrimination because he
had worked for Dacies,

The primary argument of the defendant

is that exclusion from tha list was not discriminatory as to
Mr, Smith,

He was not part of the so-called Batiste litiga­

tion, tha settlement litigation that was going on, and in
fact while he wasn't on the list, he was in Mr, Dacias' head.
The fact is, number one, that is factually wrong,
Mr, Smith was part of the Batiste settlement negotiation and
that is spelled out in detail in an affidavit that is part of
the record in a motion in limiting in which plaintiff's counsel,
a Mr. Grick, spells out that the settlement negotiations are
not limited to the Batiste case but involved a case called
Corcoran v, Farneo, and Smith is a party to that litigation,
and Smith was involved in those settlement negotiations, and
Smith's name does not coma to Daeies until precisely the same
time that Wright calls Mr, Daeies and says, "We should hire
six or eight people „e!
Furthermore, it is absolutely clear from this record
that by not being on the list, Smith had a handicap.

He was

43
not going to be considered? 37 whites ware considered# and tha
only thing they had different from him was that they were on
the list.

They had never sought to get work»

Mr. Smith had

sought to get work.
It seems to me that the burden was theirs to show
that even if he had been on the list he wculdn"t have been
hired any earlier.

And they certainly couldn't have established

that because at, the time h© was applying and making himself
available# they were looking for bricklayers and hired 41 after
he first made himself available# and they were told to get 16
percent blacks.

So I think the only'conclusion to draw is

that if he had been on the list# he would have been hired
earlier.

The second question is how the usa of that list
affects someone like Mr. Nemhard.
QUESTION:
MR. MINER:

How about Samuels?
W® think Mr. Samuels was at that job.

44
We think that the evidence in tills case was that Samuels worked
at the U.S. Steel South Works job.
U.S. Steel South Works job.

Mr. Daeies worked at the

Mr. Dacies takes credit for

by Mr. Larkin.

It turns out that in fact he was hired

He worked for Mr. Larkin.

But to clarify that

I asked Mr. Dacies* "Name feh© blacks who were on that job when
you were there," and opposing counsel objected.

And now they

say* "Had we not objected and had we let him answer that
question* he would have said* no* he would not have named
Samuels*” and they point to some interrogatories* "But you are
not in the record.t!
So I would say that based on the evidence we have*
Samuels was on that job.
there.

Dacies says there were several blacks

Samuels was one of the first.

not that they were there together.

It's more likely than

But the trial court mad©

no finding on that important question* and 1 don't think that
the evidence in the interrogatorios disputes it* particularly
in light of their objection to my question.
QUESTION;

Does Samuels8 case depend on whether or

not he was?
MR. MINER;

No.

Even if he was not in Smith's class*

he is in the same position as Nemhard.

As to Nemhard, we would

45
submit that the intentional discrimination still excluded him
from th© job., and the analysis goes something like this*
Mr. Dacies created an all-white list during the
period prior to this job»

His intention in creating that list

was not limited to excluding the Smiths and people he worked
with in the past.

His intention is just as much to have an

all-white list to usa in th© future and therefore to exclude
those blacks who will come down the road in the future for
jobs that he is looking at.

Consequently when he applies that

list to a black who is coming down in the future, that is
a factor in th© decision of the use of that list vis-a-vis -that
black.

this Court says in Keyes, when you had intentional discrimina­

The other side

that that is intentionally discriminatory is fully buttressed
by Mr. Daciesa treatment of the blacks who cam© to th© job site,

He almost runs Mr. Nemhard

Mr. Kaplan, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL H„ KAPLAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KAPLAN:

X have a few points to make, your

Honor o
First of all, in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
the Seventh Circuit deals at A7 of the appendix to the
petition for certiorari, it says, 51 The historical inequality
of treatment of black workers seams to establish 'there is
prima facie racial discrimination,'’ et cetera.

No reference

to Dacies' list, no reference to any overturning of the
district' court"s finding

that there was no pretext, no

intentional discrimination.

Number two ~

Mr. Kaplan, you say no reference to th©

That very sentence
MR. KAPLAN:

No, no.

No reference that there was

any intentional discrimination going on.

what they seem to bs concerned -iboufc is societal discrimination
against black workers.

That8s how I read the sentence, your

Honor.

But

the

part of the sentence you

”Q, So Mr. Larkin — who was the assistant superin­

Yes ,89 from Mr. Smith;.

1 think the briefs satisfied my concerns that this
Court be fully apprised of the record.
Th@ point 1 want to corae back to is how should
Furnco have hired on this job.

The EEOC and the U.S.

Government concede that our hiring system was legitimate and
nondiscriminatory.

Th© district court had found beyond a

reasonable doubt that our hiring system was legitimate and
nondiscriminatory, that it met Furncoa s business need as well
as not discriminating against blacks.
There is no evidence in the record that, the system
found t3feasibl@B by the Seventh Circuit, would have met our
business needs and have led to as many blacks being hired.
Indeed; the vice of the Furnco

hiring system«the Seventh

Circuit said; was that it was subjective, that somehow the.
job superintendent was making subjective judgments.

But the

vice of the Seventh Circuit system is that it .is equally
subjective.
system.

Indead, it's even more subjective than our

Our system was premised upon knowledge of persons6

ability to do this very specialized skill.

It wasn’t premised

upon what strangers had to say in terms of recommendations,

49
I would like to make one last point. There is no
evidence in the record that Fumco had ever engaged in any ,
discrimination prior to this job.

Thera is no finding of any

courtg administrative agency that has b@®n upheld that Furnco
had discriminated against.

The accusation is totally false.

And given the backdrop of no discrimination and the statistics
on this job and the legitimacy of the hiring system in terns
of meeting our business needs, I don’t believe there was any
racial discrimination in this case,, and I respectfully request
that you reverse the court of appeals as to those three
respondents.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentiemon.

Th® a&B® is submitted.
(Whereupon, at Is31 p.m., th® oral arguments in
th© above-entitled matter wore concluded.)
