MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Bougas»
Mr, Humphreys, you may proceed when you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. HUMPHREYS, JR,, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF CITIZENS AND SOUTHERN
NATIONAL BANK
MR. HUMPHREYS;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, my name is William Humphreys and I represent the peti­
tioner in this case, the Citizens and Southern National Bank,,
The case arises out of Titia XII, Section 94 of the
United States Code, which is known as the National Bank Venue
Act, and the case involves the application and interpretation
of that bank venue provision.
The interpretation, of that statute requires this
Court to decide whether the statute requires that: a national
bank only be sued in its home county, that is, the county
which is specified in its certificate of organization.
A second issue that must be decided by the Court in
order for any decision on the merits is to the interpretation
of the statute to be rendered meaningful is whether a
national bank may waive the provisions of Section 94 by the
e Jtnblis': jaent of a branch baric in a county other than th
county where it is chartered.

4
Those are the two issues presented by this petition
to the Court.
QUESTIONS

In how many Georgia counties does the C6S

have ban?cs?
MR. HUMPHREYS;

Your Honor, that fact is not in the

record, but I will frankly concede that C&S has branches in
many counties.
QUESTION;

In many counties?

MR, HUMPHREYS;

Yes, sir.

That is not disputed.

And in fact, in the instant case, the record shows that we did
have a branch in DeKalb County, where this suit was brought.
That is not our home office; our home office, specified in the
certificate of organization, is in Chatham County, Georgia.
QUESTION;

So you are taking the position that even

though you had a branch in DeKalb County, that suit may not be
brought there if it is not on a transaction arising out of —
well, it may not be brought there, period?
MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION;

It has to go to Savannah?

MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct, Your Honor.

Even though the volume

suppose someone

brought suit against you in Fulton County, Atlanta, and the
volume of business done by C&S in Fulton County was twenty
times what it was in Savannah;
to go to Savannah to sue von?

You would still say they had

5

MR. HUMPHREYS:

That is correct, Your Honor, if the

venue was waived by the bank in that particular ease or raised,
excuse me, then it would be required to be sued in Savannah,
its home county.
QUESTION:

You say the home office, is that —

MR. HUMPHREYSs

Yes, sir, it is; the county specified

in its charter,
QUESTION?

Well, is that synonymous with registered

office?
MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION:

Well —

In my State a corporation has to recite

in its certificate of incorporation the location of its
registered office.
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Yes.

It is a little bit different

with regard to national banks.

They are obviously federally

chartered, and there is not the registration that goes on
with State corporations, •'
Rather, there is a certificate of organization, and
in that certificate of organization, there .is a place speci­
fied, and it is that place that we contend is the home county,
that is, the pises specified in the certificate of organiza­
tion .
QUESTION:

Is it wholly within the discretion of the

bank to select any county within the State that it has a bank
at to be that certified place?

6

MR. HUMPHREYS:

Well, at the time the bank is ini­

tially chartered, the answer to your question is yes.

When

they are chartered, they will select a place that is to be
their home office, and then there are very strict provisions
that that home office, for example, cannot be moved during the
lifetime of the bank over 50 miles.

So that even if, as I

understand it, if you select County A, you cannot move your
principal office over 50 miles, period.

You can move it 50

miles with the permission of the Comptroller of the Currency,
but as 1 read, I believe it is 12 USC Section 30, you may not
move it over 50 miles, period.
QUESTION:

Are there any substantive requirements in

connection with the principal office?

Do you have to hold

your directors5 meetings there, or is it just purely a venue
provision?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

No, Your Honor.

There are approxi­

mately, when I went through and counted at least 7 or 8
Statutes that talk about activities and duties that must be
conducted where you are located.
QUESTION:
records.

Well, what about the maintenance of

Is there not any requirement that certain records

remain at the principal or chartered place of business?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Your Honor, I am not aware that

there is any specific statute in existence now that requires
that the records be maintained only at that one office.

7
QUESTION:

How about regulations of the Comptroller

General, the Comptroller of the Currency?
MR. HUMPHREYS %

Your Honor, there mav be — I do not—

there may be a regulation such as that,» I am sorry, I do not
know of any.

I do not find any specific statutory authority.

There may be certain records, but generally the bank can, of
course, now conduct business not only at its main office but
at its branch.
QUESTION:

But you do say that there are some statutes

that require at the home office the conduct of some kind of
business, is that right?
MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, what kinds?

MR. HUMPHREYS:

For example, one very important

statute, I believe, governs the amount of reserves that must
be maintained with Federal Reserve banks.

And this statute

requires that if you are located in a Federal Reserve city,
that you will maintain so many percentage of reserves.

If

you are not located in a Reserve city, the Reserve require­
ments -.are less.

This we found in 12 United States Code 142.

QUESTION:

Is that why you are in Savannah and not

Atlanta?
(Laughter.)
MR. HUMPHREYS;

No, Your Honor.

The reason we are

in Savannah is because years ago we in fact were started in

8

Savannah»
QUESTIONS

Has this bank, has the C&S ever itself

used the courts of DeKalb County?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Again, that is not in the record,

but yes, sir, I am certain that we have.
QUESTION:

It must be.

MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION:

I am certain that we have.

I would like to ask you two questions.

In this reserve calculation, I take it reserves throughout all
of the bank's branches are counted in calculating the reserves?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

I would presume so, as long as they

were part of the same bank.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the statute, my

second question is, that would preclude you from closing your
banking activities in Savannah but retaining your office for
directors' meetings and the like there?
MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION:

Well --

Say you decide to do all vour banking in

Atlanta but keep your home office in Savannah:

Could you do

that?
MR. HUMPHREYS:
answer to that question.

I am reluctant — I do not know the
I will add that with regard to the

requirement that it be moved 50 miles, that it only be moved
50 miles, period, and even then only with the Comptroller■s
permission, I am told as an anecdote that at one point in time

there was thought of trying to move the office from Chatham
County to Atlanta, and someone suggested they could only do it
at about 50 miles a week, so they would move it 50 miles one
week and 50 miles the next.
QUESTIONS
fice.

But clearly, I —-

That only relates to moving the home of­

That is not relevant to the question whether they could

discontinue banking —
MR. HUMPHREYS:

No, sir, I do not know whether, if

they could discontinue banking activities.

I believe this

would probably depend to some extent on the anser to the Chief
Justice's argument which I am unable to answer, and that is
must there be some records, must there be a physical place
that continues to be maintained in the home county, and there
may be some regulations requiring that.
QUESTION:

What limitations are imposed on branching

in the Georgia law?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Your Honor, we have opened up branch­

ing somewhat, and I believe it is not a grandfather situation.
We can pretty much go, we can merge with, and I believe this
Court considered the effects of that, what used to be 5 per­
cent banks, and I believe now we have Statewide branch banking
in Georgia,

It is not a grandfather situation,

QUESTION:

Did Georgia ever have the situation that

I understand prevails in some States in which no branches wareallowed whatever, perhaps no branches beyond the county in

10

which the home office is located?
MR. HUMPHREYS;

Oh, yes*. Your Honor.

We did have that:

law at one time, it's got the Georgia banking law gone through
several phases and I am confident that law did exist at one
point, because that is why we used to have grandfathers, or 5
percent banks, where the bank would go and could only own 5
percent of banks in. other counties, so we did have that at one
point in time.
QUESTION;

But now, so far as the law is concerned,

your bank could have a branch in every county in Georgia?
MR. HUMPHREYS;
QUESTION;

That is correct.

That is 100-and-some — how many counties

in Georgia now?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

I do not know how many counties, I

am sorry, sir, that Georgia has, but it is a. large number of
counties, and the bank will undoubtedly have branches in those
counties where it is profitable to open up an office or have a
branch.
QUESTION;

You are going to tell us what your justi­

fication for opposing this venue is, are you not?
MR. HUMPHREYS;

Yes, Your Honor.

It involves basic­

ally the meaning of two words in 12 USC Section 94 •—
QUESTION:

Is that all, just the statute?

There is

not any policy justification?
MR. HUMPHREYSs

No, 'four Honor.

This statute was

11
being presented to be written by Congress today, there is pro­
bably no policy argument, or for not writing a statute that
would alloy? a branch, a bank to be sued, anyplace it had a
branch for cause of actions arising out of the business acti­
vities conducted at that branch.

I do not believe there would

probably be a very good policy argument for not giving the
bank the same wide venue that a corporation had.
12 DSC 94 contains two basic provisions.
Federal provision and one is a State provision.

One is a

The Federal

provision says simply that a bank may be sued in any county or
in any Federal court in any district in which the bank is
established, and the State court provision provides that a bank
for state court purposes may be sued in any State, municipal,
county court in the county in which it is locat®'51.
And these two provisions were enacted, one in 1863,
the Federal court provision, and one in 1864, the State court
provision.
Now, the Georgia court, the Georgia Court of Appeals
decided that, since Congress had used a different word, “loca­
ted," in describing the venue for national banks than it did
when it described the venue for national banks, which was -excuse me — connected to the word "established", that there­
fore Congress must have intended for '’located" to have a dif­
ferent meaning, a broader meaning than the word "established'’
and therefore Congress must have intended for banks to be

12
sued in every county in which they were located.
QUESTION:

Were there any branch banks in 1864?

MR. HUMPHREYS;

No, Your Honor, there were not any

branch banks in 1864.
QUESTION;

How do you derive that intention of

Congress?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

I do not, I am not arguing for that.

I believe the Georgia Court of Appeals, as in other courts —
State Courts are trying to find ways to expand their venue.
That has always been the case.

And they looked at the diction­

ary, not the Georgia Court of Appeals but the Security Mills
v. Wachovia case in North Carolina took a run through the
dictionary to look at the various words and definitions of
"locate" and "establish1.?

This is not a very fruitful task

because one of the synonymous meanings, or synonyms for
"locateK is "to establish."

So having done that, to still

give them opposite meanings does not make a lot of sense.
And that is particularly true in light of the condi­
tions that existad in 1863.
banks in 1863.

As we said, there were not branch

A bank could only do business in one place,

the county in which its certificate of organization was is­
sued .

Ei; t more importantly, the jurisdiction of the State and

Federal courts in 1863 and 1864 was concurrent with regard to
national banks, and this to me is very important in deciding
whether "locate" and “establish" mean the same thing, because

13

until 1882, any suit against a national bank could be brought
in the first instance in Federal court without regard to di­
versity and without regard to cimounfc involved»
Similarly, any suit brought in a State court could
also be removed to a Federal court since the Federal courts
had concurrent and original jurisdiction.

Therefore it seems

to me that the argument becomes even more untenable that a
Federal court that Congress intended for State courts- to have
a broader venue and to permit suits in more State courts than
in Federal courts with this concurrent jurisdiction.
And the same really holds true today, because if a
suit, a diversity suit were brought in Georgia, in a branch,
in a place other than where the bank was Established, the bank
could remove that case to Federal court and the Federal courts
are clearly unanimous in holding that the word "established"
refers only to the place specified in the bank's certificate
of organization.
QUESTION!

Why can the bank remove in a situation

like that?
MR. HUMPHREYS!
case, Your Honor.

Well, it. would have to be a diversit

It would have to be a New York citizen

suing a bank in Georgia, for example, and bringing suit in
Atlanta.

That would not work with two Georgia citizens, such

as we have here.
QUESTION s

Since 1882.

14

MR. HUMPHREYS:

Since 1882«

Now, prior to 1882, you

have the same result, you would remove and then you could end
up back in the county where you started, or rather have the
case dismissed if you removed from Federal court to -- State
court to Federal court.
So I submit that the first argument or consideration
that should not control in this case is any consideration that
the word "located" and "established" have different meanings,
as used by Congress in 1863 and 1864.

Whatever interpretation

is given to the word "located" in this case, and this is
clearly a State court case; it is not, does not arise in the
Federal courts.

But whatever interpretation this Court gives

to the word "located" it also ifflJSt give tc the word "estab­
lished. "
It is clear, as I think we have mentioned briefly
before, that "located" and "established" when used in 1863
and 1864 referred only to one place.

There was only one place

in existence in 1863 and 1864, and that was the place that the
bank was chartered.
Now, furthermore, if you read the language of
Section 94 carefully, it is very apparent that although Congress
might have mingled the words "located" and "established", it
was very particular as to when it intended to denote a poten­
tial plurality and when it intended to mean the singular, and
thus the statute provides that the suit may be brought in any

15
district or territorial court of the United States

,

and it

further provides that the suit may be maintained in any State,
county or municipal court„

There is a potential plurality of

courts that I believe could be found from that language.
On the other hand, Congress was quite explicit that,
it could only be maintained in the district, the one district,
I would suggest, in which the bank was established and in the
one city or county in which the bark was located.
QUESTION;

Does the Langdeali case help you much or

hurt you, or is it kind of neutral?
MR. HUMPHREYS;

No, the Langdeau case helps more

than it hurts, but is not determinative of the issue.

In

Langdeau the court was concerned with whether 12 USC 94 was
permissive or mandatory.

That was the only issue before the

court.
QUESTION:

Whether it prevailed over a State venue

statute?
MR. HUMPHREYS;

That is right, whether it could be

in that way, whether it had to be applied, or whether it just
was something that could be applied«
QUESTION:

It held it had to be.

MR. HUMPHREYS:

And it held that it had to be ap­

plied.
QUESTION:
where the bank was

But there was no question there about

16
PiR. HUMPHREYS;

There was no question about where the

bank was, although the court did say that to hold that the
statute was merely permissive rather than mandatory would ren­
der meaningless a congressional enactment, permitting suits in
the bank * s home county.
Now, that is an exact quote from Mercantile.

They

coined the phrase "home county", the court in Mercantile.

This

court really for one hundred and three years, beginning back in
1371 with Bank of Bethel and going really down through .1976 in
the Radzanower case, has never intimated, and it. has had many
opportunities, that located and established referred to any
place other than the one place, theit is the place in the certi­
ficate of organization.

For 40 years the Federal courts, ever

since the Leonardi case which was decided by the 2nd Circuit
in 1936, for 40 years the Federal courts have been unanimous
in holding that "established" is determined by the place speci­
fied in the bank’s certificate of organization, and that once
that decision is made, there is no need to go further to
determine where venue properly lies in a suit against a bank.
Most courts, most even State courts in. this day, have
recognised chat "located" and "established" do, in fact, mean
not only the same thing, but that they refer only to the county

specified i:i the certificate of incorporation or, rather, the
certificate of organization.
QUESTION:

Do you have any idea when this statute

17
was passed how many States had more than one Federal district?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Your Honor, I have made diligent

search to try to find out this potential plurality question on
district and territorial.

As the statute was initially enacted

it provided that it could be brought in any circuit district or
territorial courts.

Clearly I believe in 1863 there still were

circuit courts that had primary or trial court jurisdiction.
have not been able to, the court system is very complicated in
1863, I am unable to say that there was a State that had a
district or a territory.

I do know that back in 1863 when you

write in the alternative of circuit district or territorial
court,, I feel that there must have been some overlapping.

And

even if we cannot, or I cannot —
QUESTION:

States that had more than one circuit

court, for example?

QUESTION:

Or having more than one district court?

QUESTION:

There were States that had more than one

district court.
MR. HUMPHREYS:

I know that there were district

courts that would encompass two States.

I know that.

In

other words, a district court might cover two States.

Your Honor, I think not.

It is very

I will go back and undertake that, but we have

tried diligently so that I could definitely say that State X
had a district and a circuit court in it and therefore there
was a reason for that potential plurality, but I would suggest
that my ignorance is not that damning to my argument, because
my point is that even if there was a potential plurality, just
the chance of more than one, Congress used the word "any".
Really whether there were more than one or not, I do not know,
but if there was a chance that there was more than one court
in which this case could ba brought, then they used the word
"any" — in other words, any circuit district or territorial
court, on the chance that there was a plurality.
QUESTION:

I just remembered, there must have been

plenty of States with just one district court, because if I
remember correctly, Maryland has still got one.
MR. HUMPHREYS:

There are still States today that

have only one district court.
QUESTION:

What significance if any do you attach to

the McPadden Act of 1927 authorizing national banks to branch

19
and using the word "establish” with respect to branches?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Well, the act probably could be used

to make a distinction between the location and establishment of
a bank versus the location and establishment of the various
branches of that bank.

placed no importance on it to the extent that it somehow
changes or affects 12 USC 94.

That statute was written at the

time still in terms of the basis, we believe, of the county
specified in the charter, and if for some reason "locate" and
"establish" are now supposed to mean every place where the
bank has a branch, then we have numerous other statutes, for
example the publication of comptroller's report shall be in
the city or county where you are located, these reserve re­
quirements, all of these topple like a house of cards, and in­
stead of having one central county where all of these reports
are published, the reserve requirements, suits against the
comptroller of the currency, all of a sudden these also take
on a plurality, rather than what we contend would be the
single place where they, where Congress originally intended
for these activities to take place.
QUESTION:

Is a branch of bank in and of itself,

does it. have all of the attributes of the bank?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

It may have all the attributes of

2D
the bank? it may not»

It may have the instant teller and it

may not be able to make loans, but it is permitted to have all
of the attributes of a bank»

I mean, the general business of

the bank may.be conducted at the branch.
QUESTION?

Does it have its own president and board

of directors?
MR» HUMPHREYSs
QUESTION:

A branch would not; no, sir.

Well, that is one of the important attri­

butes of a bank, is it not?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Well, yes, sir

I was directing my­

self to what the business that they could conduct»
QUESTION:

Well, the main office would not have its

board of directors

The president and the

wonId be for the main office and all of the

branches, would it not?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

That is correct; yes, sir.

The bank itself has a president and a board of direc­
tors.

Each branch would have a branch manager.

QUESTION:

Why are the requirements

you are talking about that would apply all over?

21
MR. HUMPHREYS;
QUESTION;

Well, the —

Maybe they should apply every place there

is a bank.
MR. HUMPHREYS;
QUESTION;

Well --

I did net quite get the argument.

MR. HUMPHREYS;

All right.

There are numerous other statutes.

In some of them

it might in fact be desirable to apply every place the bank
has a branch.

Publications of, as I say, directors’ meetings

and that sort of thing.

And it might be that it is desirable

for the bank to publish them not only in the. place where it is
located as specified in the statute, but also all over the
State, every place it has a branch.
I would suggest, though, it is that, sort of argument
that ought to be directed to the Congress and not directed to
this Court.

Whether it is desirable policy for a bank to be

sued everywhere or whether it is desirable policy to have
comptroller *s reports published everywhere is something we can­
not answer.
QUESTION;

Maybe Congress has already answered that.

MR. HUMPHREYS;

Well, I do not think so particularly

with regard to the reserve requirement, Your Honor, because
there it would seem like Congress certainly would not intend
to create a confusion by using the word "located" to define
the specific reserve requirements for a bank depending on the

22
county that it was located in, and that is whether it be a
central reserve county or whether it be another county; by
saying that a bank is located everywhere, then that provision
becomes if not — becomes almost unmanageable, it seems to me.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the requirement related

only to the place where publication had to be made, rather
than the content of the publication?
MR. HUMPHREYS:

No, Your Honor»

There*, are, as I say,

I tried to summarize too quickly and they are not cited in the
brief, but there are about eight more statutes in 12 USC —
excuse me, that were enacted in IB<>4 „
One of the statutes concerns the requirements for
maintaining reserves.
statute.

I mean, this is not a publication

And I do not want to suggest that that statute was

necessarily passed in 1864, but the statute provides that if
you are located in a reserve city, you will have a reserve re­
quirement of X.

If you are not located in a reserve city, you

will have another reserva.

That is not a publication? that ac­

tually directs you as to how much reserve you may have.
QUESTION:

In the State of Texas, a bank that is

chartered in Galveston and a branch in El Paso, at the turn of
the century it would take you about three days to get there,
would it not?
MR. HUMPHREYS:
QUESTION:

At least!

And it would apply, your statute would

23
apply?
MR. HUMPHREYS;
QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor,

And as of today, that bank could publish

whatever they want in the Galveston daily paper as notice in
El Paso?
MR. HUMPHREYS;

Under all of these statutes, that

would be correctj yes, sir.
In the few minutes that I have remaining, I would
like to ask the Court’s indulgence to consider the waiver ar­
gument, because many State courts having concluded that
"located* and “established” refer to only one county, then
turn right around and say, "However, this venue requirement is
waived by the erection and maintenance of another branch in
another county," that argument is not founded on juridicial
precedent, and if the Court would chink about it as I know it
will, it occurs to me that never before in American juris­
prudence have we decided that venue can be waived presumptive­
ly by prelitigation conduct.
The only case that even suggests that, if that sort
of rule was adopted, every case that comes before a trial
court, the judge is now going to be faced with an argument of
he presumptively waived venue by some conduct inconsistent
with it in advance of trial.
QUESTION;
case?

Well, what do you do about the Neirbo

24
MR. HUMPHREYS:

Neirbo was a — treac*. very lightly on

this matter and was a very narrow holding, and it involved the
corporation who specifically appointed a registered agent for
service of process.
QUESTION:

But prelifcigation —

MR. HUMPHREYS:

All right, but that was very narrow.

They found express consent to be sued by the appointment of
agent for service of process, and I would suggest that Neirbo
can never be cited or used without considering Clberding.
which was decided in 1953 by Justice Frankfurter, because
Neirbo can be read two expansively, or can be used too ex­
pansively without reading Olberdirg, because in Olberding the
argument was made that a non-resident motorist passing through
a State - - and this was hot a jurisdiction question, this was
on venue.

They had decided the constitutionality of the non­

resident motorist statute.
But the non-resident motorist was passing through a
State and for some reason venue requirements wdre not met be­
cause neither the plaintiff nor defendant, were residents of
that State, and the defendant asserted his venue right, ai}d the
court said, "No, you waived venue because we've got our non­
resident statute that says when you’re passing through the
State, you waive venue if you have an automobile wreck and you
appoint the Secretary of State to receive process,
no specific appointment was made.

S3

although

25
And Justice Frankfurter said that "but to conclude
that a motorist who never consented to be sued has agreed to
be sued and therefore waived Federal court venue is to move in
the world of Alice in Wonderland."
In other words, that non-resident motorist had not
consented expressly to be sued.

There is no case that this

Court has considered other than Neirbo in which a prelitigation
waiver has been allowed, and in Heir bo the Court, was very spe­
cific to say that it was because they had expressly appointed
an agent for service of process and therefore had expressly
consented to be sued»
Now, what the proponents of the waiver argument would
seek now is to say that any act inconsistent with asserting
venue that you do prior to trial will result in waiver of
venue, such as erecting a branch bank.

Well, I submit that

individuals do things all the time inconsistent with the nor­
mal State venue right of to be sued in your home county.
no court has ever said that because you go to

But

if you are an,

individual and you go to another county and commit a tort that
you have waived venue.

You have not waived venue, if the

statute says you have a right to be sued where you live, you
do not waive that statute prior to litigation, and that is
what ws would contend this statute says, that ci bank has a
right to ba sued where it maintains its home offices.
Thank you.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall, Mr. Humphreys.

Mr, Kovacich, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. KOVACICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KOVACICHs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
I am Mike Kovacich and I think Mr. Humphreys has out­
lined to you the crunch of the matter, and it basically boils
down to a statutory interpretation.

And there have been deci­

sions which are cited in. the briefs from various lower Federal
courts and State appellate courts dealing with this question in
recent years.
These cases revolve basically around two series of
interpretations as far as holding for the position which I
contend is proper,

The first theory, and this was the one

predominantly followed by the Georgia court, is the dichotomy
in language between the words "established" and "located".
The ruling was basically that because of this dicho­
tomy in language, once the bank set up a branch in a county
other than its charter county, if you want to use that term,
that it was located there and could be sued there, and there­
fore in compliance with the statute.
The second theory is that of waiver, that is, the
act of establishing a branch bank in and of itself constituted
a waiver.

This is what Mr. Humphreys discussed when he said

27
prelxtigation waiver.

That is the basis of the decisions in

some of the lower Federal courts which are cited in my brief,
and in some of the State court decisions9 which are also cited
But as I said, it revolves around this question of
interpreting the statute.

As to litigation in Federal court

which is not really what we have got here, but it has been
brought in for consideration in looking at the entire picture,
I would agree with Mr. Humphreys that the established does
mean that particular county.

I do not know whether that is

quite the case for State litigation, and I would not go so far
as to concede that.

But I think as some of these Federal der

cisions have held, the establishment or the conduct of busi­
ness — there were one or two of the decisions and there is
also a recent Florida appellate decision which dealt with the
question of doing business — and this gets us in part as to
what is required.
Some of these cases have contained a recitation of
like the. Reaves case, 66 branches in the Southern District of
California and all of that, the volume *— and this brings upon
the question that Justice Relinquish posed before in volume.
You may not be aware that DeKalb and Fulton Counties
are, border next to each other, and part of the City of
Atlanta is located in DeKalb.

I think that as Mr. Humphreys

response. to Mr. Justice Relinquish indicates, a considerable
portion of C&S*s business by volume is in DeKalb and Fulton

23
Counties.

I am sure the business in DeKalb ie several times

what it is in Chatham County.
And as to the question raised by Mr. Justice Blackman
about their using the courts in DeKalb, as I pointed out in ray
brief, there was earlier litigation dealing with one of the
loans that led to the unlawful redemption, as we have alleged
in our petition, and there was litigation in regard to that
filed by the bank in the exact court that this litigation in­
itiated in.
QUESTIONs

Are you suggesting that the person goes

to another State, another jurisdiction from his own and uses
their courts, that that in and of itself draws him into the
jurisdiction of that court for all other purposes?
MR. KOVACICH:
Chief Justice.

Mo, I would not, Your Eonor, Mr.

But what I am raising here is the fact that

besides using the court, the bank has established branches and
is conducting acts of business and uses the courts as a part
of conducting that business, and has become a part and parcel
of that county, and this leads into somewhat the point that
Mr. Humphreys raised about, Does going to another county and
commiting a tort waive an individual's venue?
He said no, it would not, and I believe that is a
correct statement of the law.

But many States, Georgia in­

cluded, provide that a corporation can be sued in any county
ir. which it commits a tort.

You can sue a. corporation in a

county where the tort is committed, or in a contract matter,
where the contract is entered,

So I think the courts have

recognized different jurisdictional and venue requirements as
to corporations.
QUESTION?

There is nothing ambiguous about, that

statute, is there?
MR. KOVACICH:

No, Your Honor.

That, I think that

statute is fairly clear, and I think that situation —
QUESTION!

When you talk about that statute, you axe

simply saying the Georgia Legislature as a matter of policy
declared that tc be so.

We do not have that quite that clear

kind of expression here, do we?
MR. KCVACICKs

No, wa do not. Your Honor, and be­

cause of this court8s decision in the Mercantile case, that
is holding that 12 USC Section 94 was not permissive but was
mandatory, that therefore preempts the Georgia statute for the
determination of where C«S can be sued, and the determination
has to be made under this statute.
QUESTION:
your posture:

Mr. Kovacich, I want to be sure about

bo you feel that you could sue this bank in any

county, in the State court of any county in Georgia where it
has a branch, whether this particular transaction arose out
of business from that branch?
MR. KOVACICH:
Honor.

No, I would not go that fax, Your

I would say that there has to be some connection to

that county.
QUESTION:

Why do you draw that distinction?

MR. KOVACICHs

Weil^ I think maybe because in the

back of my mind I think of the Georgia venue statute as to
corporations.

That is, if you are going to sue a corporation

oven* a tort, or a contract, you have to have some connection to
the county other than just finding them there.
QUESTION;

Do you feel you could sue in Savannah,

Chatham County, is that what it is?
MR. KOVACICHs

Yes.

Well, of course, the bank is

contending that Chatham is the only place; we can sue.
QUESTION:

That is right.

Do you think you can sue

there -- so at least on your theory, you have two counties in
which you could sue, Chatham and DeKalfo?
QUESTION:

Regardless of where the transaction was?

MR. KOVACICHs

Well, under my theory, if there were

no ties, no transactions, no part of these transactions in
Chatham County, then the only way that I could sue there is
on the fact that the statute provides a special additional
venue»
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask it again.

On the facts

of this case, on your theory, then, you can sue only in
Chatham County cr DeKalb County, not in Fulton?

MR. KC7ACICH

%

That is correct. Your Honor, because

1 am not aware of any transactions or any part of this entire

31

matter which were conducted in Pulton County,
QUESTIONS
cause

So you do not go all the way and say be­

there is a full-service branch in a county, whatever

that means — that is banking terminology — that you can sue
the bank in that county?
MRC KOVACICHs

No, I do not.

Now, I think some o£

the decisions referred to in my brief imply that possibly that
is the case, that the waiver of the establishment of the branch t
the knowing business decision to open the branch and all the
ramifications that imposes includes the right to be sued there.
Now, some of these decisions, though, do contain the
qualifying language or the limitation that there must be
)

transactions that arose out of that? otherwise I would think
the original purpose of the statute, that being to protect the
national banks, in their infancy at the time, from cumbersome
litigation, would be thwarted, and I think, I don't know
whether or not that is a legitimate purpose today, but assuming
that it is, I think that that same purpose is accomplished by
limiting the litigation to counties which have some connection,
I won't say ~~ hare we were dealing with a series of
four•or five different actions, including two separate notes.
And, you know, the record does not show and the way this case
was involved, that —
QUESTIONS

Now, you confuse me a little bit.

I sup­

pose I am not tracking, but I thought you were approaching this

32
initially on the basis cf statutory interpretation.
MR. KOVACICH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And then I, hence I am wondering why you

include the county of the branch of the transaction but exclude
a county where there is another branch and no transaction.
MR. KOVACICH:

Well, as I say, Your Honor, I think

some of the decisions do not, and -QUESTION;

I am asking about you, not those decisions.

MR. KOVACICH;

Well, I guess from the standpoint of

the fairness aspect, I do that in xny mind, that, this could
possibly be burdensome to the bank.

And I think really fair­

ness is one aspect that we have to consider in this.
QUESTION:

Well, on that approach don't yon lose

your construction argument, and aren't you forced to go into a
waiver theory?
MR, KOVACICH:

Well, I think to a certain degree, and

to me, thinking from the fact, that to resolve this question
which has gone through extensive litigation in many courts re­
cently, that this court's decision, or it might be desirable
that this court's decision also address itself to the Federal,
and the only way to do that is on the waiver theory, because
the dichotomy of language definitely does not exist and apply
to the Federal situation.
QUESTION:
"established"?

Well, you say "located” does not mean

Is that your position?

MR. KOVACICH:

Well, this — 1 think that is one

theory of application, and I think that is the theory —■
QUESTION:

What would you say about a national bank

that exists in a State that has two districts in it and it has
branches in two districts.

It would have one as its home of­

fice and another as a branch in another district.

Where may it

be sued?
MR. KOVACICH:
QUESTION:

Well —

Let’s assume that the suit is brought in

the Federal district court in the district where it has a
branch.
MR. KOVACICH:
QUESTION:

All right.

But that is not its horae office.

Can

they be sued there?
MR. KOVACXCH:

Excepting —■ if you follow my conten­

tion that the establishment of the branch constitutes a waiver
at least for: transactions arising out of -QUESTION:

Except on the waiver basis you would have

to say that it could be brought in only one district, except
for the waiver.
MR, KOVACXCH:
yes, Your Honor,

As far as the Federal is concerned,

And this is why I think we get into the

fairness question and this touches upon the matter that Mr,
Justice Marshall raised before in regard to the Galveston-El
Paso situation

34

QUESTIONj

Well, your suggestion is wa just rewrite

the statute in a fair way?
MR* KOVACICH;

No, no I am not» Your Honor.

suggesting that you rewrite the statute.

I am not

I am suggesting that

you interpret the statute and you decide what constitutes a
waiver of the prerogatives that the bank has under the statute
and I would contend to you that the establishment of a branch
should be a sufficient act to constitute a waiver, at least as
to transactions arising out of the conduct of business in that
branch.
QUESTION?
not get that notice.

Where is the notice there?

The bank does

Where was the bank told that if they

establish a branch, they will be subject to suit in that
county?
You know, waiver is a knowing waiver.
MR. KOVACICH;

I do not think* in that, sense, maybe

that there was notice, Your Honor, but I think also in the
same vein, if an individual say in Fulton County, Georgia, goes
into CSS to transact business with them, do they tell him,
"Look, if this does not go the way you want and you decide you
have to sue us, that you have to go to Savannah."
QUESTION;

No.

MR. KOVACICH:
QUESTION;

I am sure they do not.

And so —

So if he goes into an ordinary corpora*

tion store he gets the same thing, does he not?

It is the

35
extent of the law»

But you are talking about a waiver»

MR. KOVACICH;
QUESTION;
made.

Yes, I ara, Your Honor,

Well, I say a waiver has to be knowingly

Wouldn't the bank have to know when they established

that branch bank that they were waiving this statute?
MR. KOVACICH:

Well, I would think that it could be

I mean, you could argue, and I am sure that would be the bank's
position, that they must make a knowing waiver and they must ba
put on seme kind of a notice, but I really do not knew7 any way
to put the bank on any type of notice as to what other ramifi­
cations of establishing a branch bank.
QUESTION;

How otherwise can you waive a statute?

MR. KOVACICH:

Well, I think that going into that

county assumes some ramifications of it.

It is a knowing

business decision, and I am sure when they go in. there they
do not know «■— they may not know what the tax structure or the
tax rate is going to be, but they presume and know that they
have to pay, they are going to have to pay some type of taxes,
and as far as, you know, this point, it is hard to —
QUESTION;

Well, the bank knows that the statute tells

us that they can only be sued in Savannah.

That they know.

The statute says that.
MR. KOVACICH:

Well, that is the interpretation that

the bank has been operating under,
QUESTION:

Well, _now, that is what the statute says.

36

MR. KOVACICKs

Well, this is a question of statutory

interpretation. Your Honor.

Some courts including State appel­

late courts and lower Federal courts have held that that is not
what the statute means because by the establishment of the
branch, the bank waives venue.

There are decisions on both

sides of that, and in the fairness question, 1 think probably
the most classic is the Helco case, where a Mew York bank had
established a branch in the Virgin Islands, and the transac­
tion and everything arose out of the activities of the branch
in the Virgin Islands.
Now, there the 3rd Circuit's holding was that the
individual had to go to Mew York to sue the bank, but there
are then other Federal decisions, including one that crosses
State lines, that hold that the establishment of a branch is
a waiver.

One where the bank was established in Camden, New

Jersey f::i& the branch in Philadelphia, and the district court
in Philadelphia held that the establishment there was suffi­
cient action to constitute a waiver*
Now, some of the decisions have looked at other busi­
ness, or the extent of business of the branches, but I think
that it would be hard to write any definitive standards there.
QUESTION:

What do you do where the bank has its

office in Fulton County and a branch in DeKaib County?
is only a couple of feet.
MR. KOVACICH*

Yes

That

37
QUESTION;

So how would your fairness work there?

You sue in either onef I guess?
MR» KOVACICH:

Well, I think probably if that had

been the situation as a matter of convenience I -- since our
office had been handling the litigation in the prior action —
wa might have gone down to Fulton.
QUESTIONS

But —

As a matter of fact, your office has a

branch in Fulton County, does it not?
MR» KOVACXCH;
QUESTION;

No»

No.

Well, a lot of them do.

MR, KOVACICHi

No, mine is a small suburban firm,

Your Honor.
But I think one other point that this deals with is
each of the branches has a branch manager who is also generally
a vice president who can be an agent for service, and in fact,
that is how service was perfected in this case;, and how it has
been in ether cases.
But besides the — you know, the; fairness as an argu­
ment is difficult to make, but I think the statute is subject
to interpretation on either the basis of a. waiver theory, and
for this court to definitively say what actions constitute a
waiver.

Is the establishment — I would contend that the

establishment of a branch in and of itself is sufficient.
And the other, as I said, and this was the basis on
which the Georgia Court of Appeals rendered its decision, is

38
that by establishing a branch bank, the bank located itself in
that respective county for suit under that court's interpreta­
tion of this act, without getting into any waiver.
But I think that on either application, that the
motion of the bank, the original motion of the bank to dismiss
was properly denied and 1 would respectfully request that this
court affirm the decision of the Georgia Court of Appeals.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Kovacich, may I ask you a question?

I think throughout the argument both parties seem to have as­
sumed that when a Federal venue is sought to be established,
the bank can be established only in one place, end that the
branch would not be established within the meaning of the
statute.
Has this court ever so held?
MR, KOVACICH:

I do not think so, Your Honor.

I

think the reason that both parties have taken that position is
one, we have not gone into that aspect of it in as great a
depth because we are dealing with the State court issue, and
secondly, the statute uses the word "establish" in regard to
the Federal district, and as I understand it, the Federal laws
which set up the procedure for a bank, a national bank being
chartered also use that exact term, "established".

And so

from that you draw possibly an intention to mean the same
you do get this home county aspect.
te- my knowledge, as far as —-

But­

39
QUESTION:

There is no holding by this Court that a

Federal, that a branch of a national bank is not established in
the county in which the branch is located.

Thex-e is no holding

by this Court?
MR. KOVACICH:

Not that I am avare of, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
