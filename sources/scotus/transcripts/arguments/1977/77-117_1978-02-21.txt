MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

He will hear arguments

next in 77-117, National Broiler Marketing Association against
United States.
Mr, Posner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RXCHARE A , POSNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. POSNER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case, here cn certiorari to the Fifth Circuit,
is a Government civil antitrust suit, charging violations of
Section 1 of the Sherman Act against an agricultural coopera­
tive, the National Broiler Marketing Association, or NBMA.
NBMA is a cooperative of producers of broiler chickens.
The district Court granted some rejudgment for NBMA
and dismissed the complaint cn the basis of the Capper-Volsteac
Act,

That Act grants a limited antitrust exemption to agricul­

tural cooperatives composed of, and I quote, “persons engaged
in agricultural production as farmers, planters, ranch men,
dairy men, nut or .fruit growers.
The Fifth Circuit reversed the District Court Ss
decision because some of NBMA 's members contract out the socalled "grow-out" phase of broiler production to independent
contractors known as "contract growers. 11

The Fifth Circuit held

that such a producer is not entitled to join an exempt

4
cooperative.
Certain key issues are not in dispute here.

For

example, it is not disputed that a broiler chicken is an agri­
cultural product under the Cspper-Volstead Act.

Thus, we are

not concerned with producers of hot dogs, flour, refined sugar,
textile products or other manufactured products.
QUESTION:

Mr. Poster, I understand that isn't dis­

puted but, frankly, I was kind of puzzled.

What is it that the

marketing organization sells, for all its members?
MR, POSNER:

The marketing organization, itself, the

cooperative is not engaged in sale, other than some export sales,
The actual sales are made by the producer members.
QUESTION:

It is net the typical co-op then? It's

more like a trade association, is it?
MR. POSNER:

It has several functions.

One that it

has that, many cooperatives have,, it purchases products on behalf
of its members, buys for them to get lower prices.
QUESTION:
MR. POoNER:

Buys chickens, or. what?
No, it probably will buy various equip*

merit used in production, other supplies.

It also makes some

export sales and it engages in dissemination of information anc
■*

other trade association-like activities.
QUESTION:

Getting back to my original question, what

is the product as to which the price information is exchanged?
MR. POSNER:

The product is a broiler chicken which has

5
been plucked and eviscerated and its head and feet cut off and
it is then sold as fresh to the grocery stores or supermarkets.
QUboTION:

Why isn't it like meat that has been

dressed by the packers?

X know the Government concedes it, but

I frankly couldn’t quite understand it.
MR, PCSN.RR:

as the chicken, itself, is a —

It is really nothing more than a plucked

It has gone through the processing plant,

It has been, as you say, eviscerated and the head
Isn't that just like a piece of beef that’s been

packed for sale to consumers?
QUESTION:

To put it another way, if I may, is there

anything more to do before they sell It, just as they do with
the beef that Justice Stevens is talking about, except perhaps
cut it in half, if they want,, only half a chicken?
MR,. PCSNKR:

I don't know enough about the processing

of beef to answer the question fully.

One difference is that,

as I understand it, most beef has been substantially sliced and
segmented and dismembered before it

But here, the chicken is basically just a

( JEbTION:

But it has gone through a processing plant

much like a slaughterhouse, hasn’t it?
MR. PCSN.hR:

It is a slaughterhouse.

called a processing plant..

It is often

I think there is a profound

6
difference between what is <3one to prepare the bird for market
and what, for example, is done to manufacture sugar or hot dogs
or the like.
QUESTION:
sorry.

I don't understand the difference.

I am

I know the Government conceded the point, lout I just

don ft see why this is different from a piece of meat.

Well, I

shouldn't take your time on it.
MR. PCBNER:

As I say, I don't know a great deal about

the processing of beef.

If all that was Involved was taking

a steer, killing it and shipping the meat to a grocery store,
supermarket, and if that meat-packer or meat preparer for market
engaged in the various activities that these producers do, then
I assume they would also be entitled to form this type of co­
operative,
I do want to differentiate, though, very sharply, the
kind of manufactured product, of which hot dogs, flour or sugar
made from beets would be good examples, because It is perfectly
clear chat the Capper-Volstead Act was not intended to allow
manufacturers, in that sense, to form a cooperative.

That would

not be an agricultural product in the sense used in this Act,
QUESTION;

I find some difficulty along the same lines

expressed by Justice Stevens and the Chief Justice as to the
precise facts that we are talking about here.

Is there some

place in the record or are the parties sufficiently agreed so
that it could be quickly summarized as to exactly what it is

7
that the members of the association ship to Safeway or A&P and
then what* more typically, A&P or Safeway does before they put
them out on their retail shelves?
MR, POSNER:

The record, the main part of the record,

is a brief stipulation of facts, pages 6 to 30 of Volume 1.
There is not a detailed description of what exactly is done at
a processing plant.

However, what is described and conceded as

the agricultural product here is a ready to cook broiler, 90
and more percent of which are shipped fresh from the slaughter­
house,

And the activities in the slaughterhouse are the pluck­

ing of the feathers and the evisceration.
QUESTION:

Frequently, on a Safeway shelf, you will

see chicken breasts or chicken legs.

In other words, something

more has happened from the time that the bird was shipped by
the processor to the time these things appear on the shelf in
that form„
HR* POSNER:

Nell, if I understand it, sometimes the

producer will dismember the chicken and ship parts.
QUESTION:
MR, POSNER:

This isn't clear from the record?
No, it does not give that degree of

detail,
Another conceded point, less controversial with the
Justices, is that a completely integrated broiler producer,
that is one who does his own growing, is a farmer under the
Ca.pper-Volstead Act.

And this concession disposes of any

a
argument that this is a statute just to protect the little
famer, the dirt farmer.

The fully vertically integrated

producer is fully within the Act,
QUESTION:

Would that concession cover, again, a

meat packer that owned enough ranch land to grow his own cattle'?
Would it apply or be any different?
MRo POSNER:

That is true if what the meat packer is

shipping,is selling, is definable as a raw or original agricul­
tural commodity.
QUESTION:

The fact he killed it and chopped it up

in pieces wouldn't make any difference?
MR, POSNER:

If it is merely killed and sliced, it

would retain its original agricultural character.

If it were

processed into lunch meats or hot dogs or hamburgers, it would
be a manufactured product.
QUESTION:

I know the Government has conceded „

Are

there any cases that hold that this kind of product is an
agricultural product and this kind of vertically integrated
entity is a farmer?

I know the Government does concede it, but.

I was kind of surprised.
MR. POSNER: There are very — Actually there are very
few decided cases under the Capper-Volstead Act in the entire
history of the Act, and in those cases these issues have not
occurred, have not been raised.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more and then I will

9
leave you ~~
Why, If the fact that two members don't even control
any breeder flocks, under Gase-Swayne. why doesn’t that dispose
of the ease?
MR, POSNER:

A producer who does not control a

breeder flock ~~ and it is important to distinguish a breeder
flock from a broiler flock,

A breeder fleck, that is the

parents of the broiler chicken.

A breeder flock are the

pullets who produce eggs which are then hatched.

Nov/, the

producer v/ho does not have a breeder flock, might, for example,
have a hatchery.

And that would mean he would purchase the

eggs from the owner of the breeder flock.

Those eggs he would

hatch in his hatchery.
QUESTION:

Do these two do that?

MR, POSNER:

Yes.

He would take the chicks from the hatchery
and place them with the grower and he would supervise the
growing of the chickens,send his personnel to supervise them,
ship them feed, capture, catch and coop the chickens after the
grow--out stage.
QUESTION:

Is it not correct, Mr. Posner, that we

must conclude that those two members are fanners, within the
meaning of the Act, in order for the whole co-op to be exempt?
under Case-Shayne?
MR. POSNER:

Yes. There is no question — Well, let

10

me put It this vtay,,

The differences between these producers

are not material producers.
QUESTION:

If any one is not a farmer, the whole

defense fails.,., if x understand Case-Swayne, isn't that correct?
MR. PG3NKR:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.
So, we have to take the two most difficult

examples from your point of view and satisfy ourselves that these
are farmers in order for the co-op to prevail?
MR, POSNER:

Yes.

I have no particular difficulty

with the ones that do not have a breeder flock or do not have
a processing plant,

I don't think those are the essential

elements of being a producer or being a farmer.

The assenti»?,

element is the ownership of the broilers from chick to when
they are ready to market.
QUESTION:
MR. POSNER:

And taking the market risks.
Taking the market risks, using your

parsonnej. ou plaice cne ohickv , to supervise the growing, uO
pick up the chicks, coop them, haul them off and to furnish the
feed.

And those responsibilities are assumed by all of the

producers.

The fact that some of them may not have a particula r

type cf plant which most of them have is not material.
QUESTION:

Well, that has to be your position,

doesn't it, Professor Posner, that you have no difficulty with
it, otherwise your case goes down the drain?
MR. POSNER:

Yes, but the essence of a farmer is not

11

the ownership of a feedmill or a slaughterhouse or a breeder
flock;, that is the parents of the agricultural commodity or
flock in which we are interested.

Mow. if I don't regard the

fact that some of these producers don't have all of the plants
which are typical in this industry as harmful to our position.
QUESTION:

hoes the record disclose, incidentally,

the attitude of the Department of Agriculture as to the appro­
priate interpretation of the Capper-Volstead Act?
MRo POSNER: Do, it does not.

There is a footnote on

page 21 of the Government's brief, Footnote 42, which states
the Department’s current position on two statutes discussed in
that footnote, neither of which is the Capper-Volstead Act.
Both are statutes under which these producers have received
other forms of assistance from the Agriculture Department.
QUESTION:

Mr. Posner, maybe I misheard you.

If you

said page 21, the Government's brief has run out at page 11.
MR. POSNER:
opposition.

You may be referring to the brief in

The brief for the United States —

QUESTION: The new color —
MR. PCoNER:

X am sorry.

Let me take another moment to describe what these
producers do and why we think they are farmers.

And here I

will discuss the typical member, the integrator, although
there are some differences among them.
1 stress the -- starting when the chicken is born, at

12
the hatchery.

At that point, for all of these, all the members

of this cooperative, they owr. those baby chicks and they willown the chickens throughout until they are sold to the super­
markets.

They take the chicks to a grower.

When the chicks

are a day old, they haul the newborn chicks, more concretely
to a poultry house, and that is where the chickens are going to
grow for seven or eight weeks until they are ready for slaughter.
This is the .grow-out stage.

And a poultry house will house up

to 40,300 chickens at one time,

Sometimes the integrator, the

producer, the member of the cooperative owns the poultry house,
himself, and when that is true, then he is uncontrovertibly the
Capper-Volstead farmer.

More commonly the poultry house is

owned by these contract growers, independent contractors.
And the grower then has the oustcry of the chickens for the
seven or eight weeks, while they are growing.

It doesn't

follow, however, that the Integrator relinquishes his control
of the chickens during this period,

Of course, he owns them

throughout and bears the market risk, but in addition he supplies
and delivers the feed for the chickens.

The feed is the major

input into the production of a chicken.

Ee supplies them with

all medicine, vaccines..

He inoculates the chickens.

He tells

the grower what diet, what mixture of feeds to administer to
the chickens at different periods of their growth.

His employees

field men or supervisors, as they are called, visit the grower
weekly to supervise the growing of the chickens,

And at the end

13

of the seven or eight weeks,vhen they are mature, the integrator
sends his employees to catch the birds, coop them and truck the
cooped birds to the slaughterhouse.

And these employees who

catch ancl coop the birds, like the field men who visit the
grower weekly, are as much farm laborers as the grower, himself,
and his hired help.
If we look just at the costs which are incurred in
the live production stage, before’you., get to the slaughter­
house, the integrator incurs 90$ of those costs and the grower
only 10$.. If you added in the slaughtering costs, which is
done entirely by the integrator, then his percentage of costs
is even higher,
Because broilers are your typical perishable agri^
cultural product, because these producers are not well informed
about conditions of demand -~
QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question that has

occurred to me.
At the point immediately before the chicken goes to
the slaughterhouse, or the processing plant, while it is still
alive, does the owner of the chicken have an option to do some­
thing else with it?
MR, POSNER:

The owner of the chicken is the producer,

not the grawer.
QUESTION:

Does the producer have an option to do

something other than kill it at that particular stage of its

14

life?
MR. POSNER:

No., he does not.

If the — There is. as

far as I know, no substantial market for a
QUESTION:

Larger chicken,

MR. POSNER:

I was going to say there is no market,

as far as I know, for the unplucked chicken.

But, in addition

to that —
QUESTION;

These are 2|- pound chickens, or something

Ixke fcnat, aren't they?

Couldn't they let them get a little

bigger and use them for some other market, like fryers?
MR. PCSNER;
tical.

No.

A fryer and a broiler are iden­

They are the same young chicken.

If you let the

chicken stay and grow, he becomes unmarketable.

There is some

market for a roast chicken, which is a larger chicken.

But,

ordinarily if the chickens are allowed to grow, if they can't
be sold after eight weeks, they are generally written off or
lest,
QUESTION:

They are previously, contracted out, anyway,

aren't they?

MR* POSNER:
QUESTION:
MR. POSNER:
as I understand it.

To the retail store.
Yes, to the supermarket.

That's a contract,

Nelli, it typically doesn't work that way.,
The details of the relationship with the

supermarket are not in the record.

What the record does say is

that the retail demand for the chickens is unpredictable and
variable,, and that sometimes the producer will find hiuiself with
a flock that he must sell because he can't let them grow beyond
their eight-weex s,.oe and then tie
QUESTION:

w&&

to find a distress ouolet,

I can understand why at the age of eight

weeks the product is perishable in the sense that it has to be
marketed right away, but after it has — the chicken has been
killed and dressed why can't it be frozen and stored indefin­
itely?
MR* POSNER:

For reasons that are not explained in

the record, that I do not understand, there is not a substantial
market for frozen chicken.

The record does show that more than

90$ of the chickens sold toy the producers are shipped fresh,
not frozen.

Tht=y are lightly chilled to preserve them for the

week or so that it takes to be sold at the counter, but they
do not keep.

They are perishable.

QUESTION:

Mr. Posner, perhaps you have covered this

before, but it is suggested in at least or.e of these amicus
" ’iefs that we have that there is a choice here, an alternative,
either the contract broilers are within the exception, the

16

Capper-Volstead exemption from the Antitrust Law or your clients
are, but they can't both be.
MR. PQbMBR:

But you reject that, don't you?

Yes, in fact, until this case was brought,

the grower and the producer were both conceded farmers.

For

example, this producer cooperative contains as members co-ops
of growers.

And, as I said, until this ease, there was no

suggestion that -QUESTION:
the other isn't?

That one or the other is, and if one is

That’s the suggestion here.

MR. POSNER:

The problem that has happened with

poultry production is that the attributes of a complete or
traditional farmer have become divided between two entities.
The grower has some, in the sense that he actually has the dayto-day custody of the birds.

The integrator has, we would

argue,more or at least as many because he bears the market
risks and markets the birds, supervises them.
their diet.

He formulates

He inoculates them and does many of the things

which, in traditional agriculture, are the farmer's job.
The Justice Department and the court below have said
the only thing that counts in whether a firm is a farmer Is
whether it has ownership of the land or custody of a crop.
we say that's just a rule to decide this case.

Anc

It can be very

easily circumvented simply by rewriting the contracts with the
growers to designate them as employees.
This Court has experience with the difficulty of a

17

rule which turns on the concept of title,
QUESTION:

It is not title.

Tenant farmers are

surely under the Capper-Volstead, aren't they?
MR. POSNER:

Yes. that would fall under the grant of

the Government*s rule by which the person with custody is the
farmer and the person with title of the land is another farmer,
thus, the plantation owner and the tenant farmer.
In the poultry case, the ownership of the land, that
is to say the land under the poultry house, is in the grower
ar;d the custody is in the grower, though really divided with
the integrator.

But if these contracts with the growers were

re-written so that the growers became employees, then under the
'

Justice department‘s test the integrator-producers would become
fa.rmers.
he have mentioned in our brief that the trend in
poultry production is toward the complete integration of the
operation, under the integrator.

Two of the members of the

cooperative grow li-Op of their own birds, one 43$.

Still most

And yet that

is a situation that is changing in the direction of greater
integration.

And if the Fifth Circuit's decision were upheld,

that would just give the producers an additional impetus to
continue this trend of buying out growers.
If there are no further questions, I’d like to
reserve my time.

18

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Posner.

Mr. Shenefield.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. SHEWEFUIi), ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHENEFISLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a case about statutory interpretation, about
the statutory interpretation of a word in a statute.

The cen­

tral legal question in the case is whether integrators or con­
tract producers, that do everything in the production of chicken
except do the actual growing, who have divorced themselves from
the actual farming of chickens, whether those integrators are,
nevertheless, farmers within the meaning of the Capper-Volstead
Act.
Now, the importance of the case, it seems to me, lies
in this single fact:

Reading the legislative history of this

statute, the 67th Congress in 1922, you come inevitably, it
seems to. me, to the conclusion that that Congress intended to
safeguard actual farmers, farmers on the land and doing the
tilling or shepherding of the crops and the flocks.

They did

that, they had that intention, in order to safeguard the farmers
against the middle man, against the processors, against the
marketers.

And so, the case really raises a familiar question,

namely, are we to honor that original exemption, that original
intention in a limited way, focused on the fact situation that

19
•was presented by that Congress, or whether we are now to inter­
pret It in a somewhat more relaxed fashion.
QUESTION:

Wasn't their intent also to treat as

differently, under the antitrust laws, farmers because they
bore the risks of drought and price depressions in a way that
lots of other purchasers didn't?
MR, SHENJEFIEJX :

The risk turns out not to be crucial,

I believe, in the legislative history.

You have to put into the

context of the times, it seems to me. the legislative history.
After World War I, this country went through an extraordinary
agricultural depression.

Senators described the state of agri­

culture as a shambles,: as in the worst depression that
ever seen.

1 had

And so, when Congress sought to fashion these words

and to focus its exemption it did so, not so much because there
was a risk of one kind' or another, but because they saw farmers
'leaving the farms and going' to the city.
QUESTION:

Wasn't one of the reasons the farmers

were leaving the farms just because of this agricultural
depression, whereas other parts of industry were prosperous
and thatawas because farmers suffered from these peculiar
risks?
MR, SHENiFIELv:

When you look at the reasons that

farmers at the land in the farmhouses suffer, the risk they
bear, the cost they invest,and all of those factual things are
the things one looks at.

But it seems to me no single one of

20

them nor indeed any of them in an aggregate should be deemed to
be determinative.

It seems to me you have to look back at the

word" of the statute,themselves* and at the legislative history.
QUESTION:

How long has the Antitrust Division though!

that the farmer excluded the integrator?
MR, aHENEFIELD:

That raises the question* Mr. Justice

White;, of the business review procedure.
QUESTION:

In 1271

I’ll put it the other way.

Did it ever

consider the integrator to be a farmer?
MI, SHENEFIELD:

It did.

In 1959, it issued a

business review which focused on the risk and came to the con­
clusion that the integrators

iere farmers, within the Capper-

Volstead Act.
QUESTION:

I suppose the Department then looked back

and put the legislative history in context,
MR. DKENfj I. ;i:

j think it refined its views and in

1971 it issued a second business review letter, making quite
clear that these integrators were not to be considered farmers,
And, indeed, a press release was issued at the same time.

All

business reviews, as a matter of fact, state, either in the
relevant code, of Federal regulations or within their own four
corners, that they are to be taken as a snapshot of intention
at that particular time and may, indeed, be revised or rescinded.
And this is just such a situation,

I think it is very difficult

to argue that anyone was misled in this situation.

21

Let me say two things, three things*about what the
case is not about.

It is not about the legality of the

Petitioner's conduct.

The posture that the case finds itself

here, the Court is simply required to construe a particular
statute.
Second, it is not about the wisdom of the provisions
of the Capper-Volstead Act.

Really, the task, I guess, of the

Court here toda._y is to try to determine what that 67th. Congress
would have done had it adverted to the issue before the Court.
And third, it is not about the most economically
efficient way to run the poultry business.

We don't challenge

vertical integration, backward or forward.

We challenge only

the notion that integrators v.ho have withdrawn or who have
>

divorced themselves from the actual farming of chickens have
a right to fix prices behind an exemption intended only for
a c t i v e fa m e rs.
QUESTION:

But you would agree, I take it, that if

the integrator integrates a little farther and does the growing
that he is a farmer?
MR. iSHENEPIEIi-:
QUESTION:

vie would agree with that.

And then those larger and more integrated

units could price fix as a cooperative?
MR, SHEfjfEF!£!£>:

That's correct.

But I think the

crucial point is not that we are objecting to vertical inte­
gration as a general concept.

With particular emphasis on your

22

question ~~
QUESTION:

The question is whether this is a coopera­

tive of fanners, not whether vertical integration is permissible.
MR. 3HENEFIELS:

That's precisely correct.

’We do

not challenge the vertical integration.
QUESTION:

On that point, Mr, Shenefield, what if

the meat packers bought up a lot of ranches and.JrJhen formed
this kind of an association?
MR, oHENEFIEJX.:

-Would they be exempt?

It would depend on the resolution of

the question whether meat in that form packed by meat packers
were an agricultural product.
QUESTION:

Suppose what they sold was just unfrozen.

MR. 3KENEFIEJX :

The debates, the Capper-Volstead

debates, themselves, particularly the words of Senator
Cummings, make quite clear that he thought meat packed in
that way was an agricultural product.

And, if that were the

conclusion, then they would be farmers in the situation hypo­
thesis you proposed »
QUESTION:

Of course, at the time the statute was

passed we didn’t have the art of freezing.
So you would say that the meat packers could get
together and buy some ranches and they could come under the
exempt Lon?
MR. SHENEFIEIT:

That subject came up in the legis­

lative history, as I recall it, and there are references to

23

Mr. Amour and Mr. Swift, who if they bought the ranch land
and raised the cattle themselves and endured those particular
kinds of risks, they too could be farmers.

And that was re­

garded as a problem, but it was regarded as a necessary defect
of trying to form some kind of standard in words that they had
available to them.
QUESTION;

MR. tSHENEFIELD:

Well, first of all, six members of

NBMA do not own either hatcheries or breeder farms.

QUESTION:

Would it be enough if the integrator just

oivned the land but nevertheless got an independent contractor
to come on his land to do the growing function?
MR. SHENEFI.iu : The legislative history suggests that
land ownership,, on the one hand,, and tilling the soil, on the
other hand, are both separate and independent.

Amendment, which is referred to in our brief at page 15.

QUESTION;

I have another problem.

We’ve talked a

lot about what the legislators might have been thinking about

Do you read the statute as permitting -- if you had a

group of farmers who presumably could form a cooperative market­
ing agent, do you think they would be exempt if instead of doing
that they just agreed on prices and agreed to sell independently
at agreed prices?

And that’s what this charge is, I believe.

way so that the sole question, 1 take it, is the applicability

fix prices without acting through marketing agents?
MR* SHENEFIEI^ :

No.

We concede only that if they

farm, they themselves raise, they are then exempt from the
antitrust laws.

QUESTION:

One of the difficulties with this case,

to me, Mr, Shenefield, is that the record is so sparse as to
actual facts,

I realize this complaint and stipulated facts

and no trial, but it seems inevitably the discussion does turn
to what these people are doing, and not all of us, at least,
are sure of what they are doing,
MR. SHENEFIELD:

The case comes to this Court on

the basis of sufficient facts, at least in my view, to dispose
of the issue of whether these defendants are farmers, within
the Capper-Volstead exemption.

Other questions that the

defendants raised in their answers, such as the applicability
of the Cooperative Marketing Act of 1926, and all of those
questions, never were reached by the District Court,

narrow fashion.

It seems to me that that's exactly

correct, taking into account the concern that the Congress
had for the farmers and their well-being, as opposed to
Mr, Amour and Mr* bwift,
I was addressing, just briefly, the one opportunity
the Congress had fee confront a similar kind of problem to the
situation v/e have here today, the Phipps Amendment, which is
mentioned, as I said, on page 15 of the brief.

Senator Phipps,

in effect, proposed an amendment to exempt activities of manu­
facturers or producers of agricultural products, provided two
things.

Provided they entered into pre-planting contracts and

provided the farmers compensation depended upon the price of
the agricultural commodity in the ultimate market,

Now, when

he talked of that amendment, he spoke of several kinds of
products that he thought

several kinds of processors that

he thought might be covered by it.
vegetables.

Milk was one.

Fruits and

Supporters of the Capper-Volstead Act were

steadfastly opposed to the Phipps Amendment, and it was de­
feated»

But they were opposed because it seemed to them that

it went far beyond that narrow concern that they had.

And

that whole incident is instructive to us for several reasons.
One, it was quite clear as a result of the debates
that pre-planting contracts, the kind of arrangement for the
sale of the crop in advance of planting, was not sufficient
to make those processors farmers under the Capper-Volstead
Act, as that Congress saw it, even though that meant that the
processors bore much of the risk of market fluctuations up
and down.

:
It also showed that the Congress thought an exemption

or an amendment to the bill then on the floor was required to
exempt those persons, that the Capper-Volstead Act did not do
it.

And it was rejected precisely because it addressed the

question of middle-men and processors and sought to aid them.
And that was one of the things Congress saw as the difficulty
of the farmer,
So the defeat of the amendment is importantj indeed,
it is regarded as significant by this Court in the CaseSwayne opinion.

And the reasons for the defeat are crucial

31

because, In effect, it shows that Congress wanted to narrowly
focus the exemption, as much out of concern for the consumers,
down the distribution chain, as out of concern for the farmers
themselves.
Now the general theme of the language, plus the
legislative history, was precisely the exercise this Court
went through in Caae-hwayne, which we regard as definitive
in the explication of this exemption.
Let me just call attention to three or four things
in connection with Case-Swayre.

As we menioned earlier,

given the fact that two of the members of NEMA are neither
hatchery owners nor breeder flock owners -- or six of them
are not — and two,in addition, do not own feed processing
plants, we win under Case-owayne.

But we go beyond that.

Once you look at the reports, particularly House
Report Number 24, which is cited in our brief, the debates
which are mentioned in our brief and recounted in Case-Dwayne,
the Phipps Amendment, which is set out in a footnote in CaseSway ne, you come, it seems to me, Inevitably to the conclusion
that these kinds of processors, the processors that were orange
processors in Case-dwayne anc one similar to that in this case,
are not farmers within the Capper-Volstead Act.
And then the conclusion that Case-Awayne reaches
is particularly instructive,

to hat it says is that you could,

it seems to the authors of the opinion, expand the exemption.

32

You could interpret it broadly.

But because the purpose of

Congress in enacting the Capper-Volstesd Act was to create a
special exception to a general rule., to a general legislative
plan, the exemption is to be narrowly construed.

And that is

set out in full at 339 U. 334.
So, we argue strongly that NBMA members are not
farmers because they do not meet the twin standards, ownership
of the land or working of the land, and that that is the de­
termining standard, both in the language "producers of agri­
cultural products as farmers."
in the legislative history.

It is the determine standard

You simply cannot read the legis­

lative history without getting that clear signal.

And it is

the determining standard in cases in this Court that have
construed that statute.

MR. tiHBNi-PljjX':

It doesn't seem to me that there

is anything necessarily in the debates which would rule that
out as a possibility.
QUESTION:

But there wasn't any such thing in 1922.

KR. SHENbFIkIX:

As long as you are trying to divine

the essence of what that Congress thought farmers were inter­
ested in, or what farmers did, it had to do with, not neces­
sarii;; ownership of the land, but actually producing the crop,

33
being involved with the production of the crop or the shep­
herding of the flocks.

The producer suffers from the same

middle-man problem in the one case as in the other.
MR, SHTNEFIuIiJ:

That's exactly correct.

And as I

understand the law under that Act, it is roughly parallel to
the law under this one,
Thus, in our argument, in our view, Congress, in
I922, did not exempt these integrators from the antitrust laws.
The Phipps Amendment shows that, to the extent it was addressed
at all, the resolution was that they were not exempt.
Now, Petitioner argues — and I think correctly —
that farming has changed in a major way since 1922«
Petitioner, in effect, is arguing here that the
integrators are farmers in the true sense.
We agree that the poultry business has changed but
we say two things, *-hat the word "farmer" has changed not a
whit since 1922, and the intention of that Congress has ap­
parently not changed.

The fact of industry change of evolving

business circumstances does not, it seems to me, provide an

34
adequate basis on which to reverse a choice, rather self­
consciously made, by Congress.

:

In the fe is son case, this Court wrote that "language
is not a vessel into which you can pour a vintage that better
suits present day tastes."
Petitioner's argument that the integrators must be,
deserve to be and must be treated as farmers, it seems to me,
should be addressed to Congress and not to this Court.

The

67th Congress which passed the Capper-Volstead Act made Its
views plain enough.

MR. PCbN&R:

Let me add with regard to the Phipps

Amendment.,which keeps cropping up, the Phipps Amendment said
that someone who made flour was not an agricultural producermerely because he had a deal with the wheat farmer that gave
him a percentage of the crop.

It has to do with what is an

agricultural product and the difference between a raw agri­
cultural product and a manufactured product, which is not
within the scope of Capper-Vclstead, even though it is
produced from agricultural input.
And, finally, Mr. Justice Stevens, there is nothing
in the Capper-Volstead Act that requires a cooperative to hav
a marketing agent.

The statute permits producers to act to­

gether in processing and marketing their product.

And one

form of acting together is the exchange of information.

11R. PObNER:

Yes,

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one other question.

Is it also not true that the legislative history
shows a great; interest in the cooperative movement, the idea
of trying to market through common cooperative agencies?
That was one of the things that Congress specifically intended
to give its approval, just as it wanted to approve union
organization, at the same time.

As to the selling of the broilers,

QUESTION:

Am I right in this?

There is nothing --
