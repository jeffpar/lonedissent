OPAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 77-836
MR. FARR;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

May it please the Court;
These consolidated cases from the Supreme Court of
Mississippi and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit pre­
sent a common central issue and that is whether land purchased
by the United States and held in trust for the Mississippi Band
of Choctaw Indians and declared a Reservation by the Secretary
of the Interior pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act, con­
stitutes Indian Country within the definition found in 18 USC
1151.
The state case also presents a dependent issue,
whether if these lands are Indian Country, the Federal Courts
have exclusive jurisdiction over crimes involving Indians as
they traditionally do, or whether the history of the Mississippi
*

Choctaws in some way compels a departure from the generallyaccepted rule.
Now, I would like to emphasize briefly at the outset

4
that what we were talking about in terms of federal jurisdiction
here is not a plenary sovereign jurisdiction excluding all state
jurisdictione

It is simply the limited preemptive authority

over matters involving Indians that is common in Indian Country,
For reasons that I shall discuss, we believe that the
Choctaw Lands are Indian Country and thus are subject insofar
as crimes involving Indians are concerned, solely to jurisdic­
tion of the ferleral court.
QUESTIONS

You are saying that your position with

respect to this Reservation is different than your position
with respect to the Navajo Reservation, for example?
MR„ FARR:

No, I am saying that our position with

respect to this Reservation is the same but it is no broader
than that, so when we talk about exclusive jurisdiction we are
not suggesting, for instance, the state does not have jurisdic­
tion over crimes solely involving non-Indians as it does under
the McBratney rule or that it would not have sovereign juris­
diction over its citizens if they go off the Reservation.
QUESTION:

But on every piece of this Reservation *—

how many pieces are there?
MR. FARR:

There are tracts in seven different

QUESTION:

Well, how many pieces, separate pieces

counties.

are there, do you know?
MR. FARR:

Well, I am not sure what you mean by

5

"separate pieces,"
QUESTION:

Well, how many non-cantiguous tracts are

there in the Reservation?
MR. PARR:

Well, I am not sure what the answer to

QUESTION:

There are at least seven.

MR. FARR:

There are several basic areas.

QUESTION:

There are at least seven.

MR. FARR:

That is correct,

QUESTION:

And probably more.

MR. FARR:

There are more than seven basic areas

that is.

which are not contiguous but there are at least seven basic
areas, as I understand it, that comprise the Reservation.
QUESTION:

MR. FARR:

Those collectively —

QUESTION:

Or individually, then.

MR. FARR:

As parts of a Reservation, that is correct,

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, would your position be affected

at all as to whether the victim of the crime is an Indian or a
non-Indian?
MR. FARR:

Not on this particular issue, no.

QUESTION:

All right.

MR, FARR:

That does, perhaps, have a relevance to

another issue which I will mention in a moment.

These cases arise out of a single incident that
occurred on the Choctaw Land»

In October, 1975 a Federal Grand

Jury indicted Respondent John,, who is a full-blooded Mississippi
Choctaw Indian, for assault with intent to kill one Artis
Jenkins under 18 DSC 1153, which as the Court is familiar with,
is the Major Crimes Act.
The indictment stated that the offense occurred on
and within the Choctaw Indian Reservation and on land within
the Indian Country under the jurisdiction of the United States.
At trial the Government requested instruction not
only on the offense charge, but also on the assault with a
dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while the De­
fendant relying on Keeble versus the United States, 412 U.S.,
asked for an instruction on the lesser included offence of sim­
ple assault as defined in 18 USC 113 E„
The instructions were given.

Respondent was ac­

quitted of the Major Crimes but convicted of simple assault
and sentenced to SO days in prison and a $300 fine.
After posttrial motions, Respondent appealed his
conviction to the Fifth Circuit, arguing that although Keeble
requires the giving of instruction on the lesser-in®luded offen­
se, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment
of conviction on that offense.
And this is in response to Mr. Justice Stevens.

We

have suggested that if the Court accepts our position on these

7
lands as Indian Country, that it remand the case to the Fifth
Circuit to consider that issue but that it is possible that the
race of the victim may be a factor in determining that juris­
dictional question but the record simply does not show whether
the victim was an Indian or not and Respondent does not urge
that here.
In any event, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the
issue but asked the Department of Justice to file a brief dis­
cussing whether the crime occurred in Indian Country at all and.
the Department of Justice took the position in its brief, the
position with which Respondent agreed, that the crime did occur
in Indian Country, but the Fifth Circuit disagreed for reasons
that I will discuss shortly and reversed the convictions.
Meanwhile, after the federal prosecution was com­
pleted, state authorities also contained an indictment against
John for exactly the same offense, charging aggravated assault
under the Mississippi statutes.
ment

He moved to dismiss the indict­

on grounds that the federal courts had exclusive juris­

diction.

The motion was denied and he was convicted and sen­

tenced to tv7o years’ imprisonment.

N

The Mississippi Supreme Court, in a decision that
was actually rendered before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit decision, held that these lands were not Indian country
and thus that the state had exclusive jurisdiction.
fore, affirmed the conviction.

It there­

8
Now, turning first to the provisions of Section 1151,,
the statute defining Indian Country which is found at page 40A
of the Appendix to our Petition for Certiorari; we submit that
contrary to the conclusions reached by the Court Belov;, these
lands, held in trust for the Choctaws, fit very comfortably
within the definition of Indian Country found there.
To begin with, 1151A includes within Indian Country
all lands within the limits of any Indian Reservation under the
jurisdiction of the United States.

And this Court for over 60

years has recognized that such Reservation lands, even if they
are not original Indian lands, are Indian country so long
the Court said in Donnelly, "They are lawfully set apart as an
Indian Reservation."
Now, here the Secretary of the Interior -~
QUESTION:

That is from judicial decision and not

from an expressed language of Congress, right?
MR. FARR:

The language that I just quoted in

Donnelly was prior to the definition.
QUESTION:

Well, you say it has been recognised for

over 60 years, the exclusivity of federal jurisdiction over
country but that is by reason cf judicial decisit.. and
not by reason of a Congressional statute making it so, am I •—
MR. FARR:

Justice Rehnquist, I think the Court has

recognised that the federal courts have jurisdiction —- leaving
aside exclusive jurisdiction for a moment -— over Reservations

9
for much longer than 60 years,

The point that I was raising

here is that for a certain time it was recognized that only the
original Indian lands comprised an Indian Reservation and then
in Donnelly,, the Court departed from that and for the first
time recognized something that now has been picked up by Con­
gress in the definition of Indian Country, that they do not
have to be original Indian lands, as long as they are lawfully
set apart for the Indians,
In any event, as I was saying, -QUESTION:
tarior.

You mentioned the Secretary of the In-

This was in 1944, was it not?
HR, FARR:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION:

Isn’t that kind of late?

MR. FARR:

To declare this a Reservation?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FARR:

I think that is because of the history of

the Choctaws, which we have set out in our brief, which shows
that what he was doing in this particular case was declaring
a Reservation for a group of Indians who were left behind when
the original Choctaw Tribe moved to the Western Territory so
that is why he was coming at this late time to provide a Reser­
vation for them.
QUESTION:

All those or less.

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry?

QUESTION:

There is a great bunch of Choctaws in

10

Oklahoma.
MR. FARR;

That is correct but what we are concerned

with here is the provisions that the Secretary of the Interior
then made for the ones who remained in Mississippi.

And what

he did was acting pursuant to Section Seven of the Indian Re­
organization Act which contains an explicit authorization that
the Secretary can declare an new Indian Reservation.
He proclaimed those lands a Reservation and that
status continues to the present time and of course, includes
the period of time during which the offenses here were committed.
Therefore, our first submission is that we think it
is plain on its face that these lands fit within the definition
of 1151(a).
In addition, I would like to point out that 3.151(b)
speaks to all independent Indian communities within the borders
.$

of the United States and while I do not intend to go back
through the entire history of the Choctaws which we have set
1'

out at pages 18 to 23 of our brief, I would like to emphasize
■?

\

that the United States, having finally been moved by the sorrowful plight of the Mississippi Choctaws after the remainder of
their Tribe moved to the Western Territory, has been providing
benefits for this Tribe including educational benefits, schools,
lands, agricultural benefits since 1918 and has held —
*,

QUESTION:

How long is it that the Mississippi

Choctaws have been a Tribe?

11

MR. FARR:

Well, they organised under the Indian

Reorganisation Act and that was approved by the Secretary of
the Interior in 1945.
QUESTION:

1945?

MR, FARR:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

So that was from late 1918 to 1945 it was

not providing aid to any Tribe.
MR. FARR:

What it was doing was providing aid to a

group of Indians who —
QUESTION:

Individual members of a group.

QUESTION:

Sure.

MR. FARR:

Well, it was providing it to the indivi­

dual members —
QUESTION:

Not to a group as a group, but to indivi­

dual members of that group.
MR. FARR:

Well, in 1939, for example, they did pro­

vide for these lands to be held in trust for the common benefit
of the Mississippi Choctaws so that was certainly legislation
for a group and I think logically the provision of schools is
for them as a group.
QUESTION:

It is not purely for single individuals.
Well, Mr. Farr, I suppose you are going

to get to -- I take it that the State8s submission is, in part
at least that whether this is a Reservation or not,, the United
States is not permitted to treat these particular Choctaws as
Indians because they were once subjected to state jurisdictions.

12
MR. FARR:

Right, 1 intend to get to that right away.

What I was just pointing out at the outset is that aside from
those arguments, it seems to me quite clear that these lands
fit within the definition of Indian Country in Section 1151 and
~t is just a question now of whether in some v;ay Congress was
disabled from putting them there.
QUESTION:

Well, what does -- you have referred a

couple of times to the fact that it is clear that these lands
fit within the definition of Indian Country in 1151.

What does

that do for you if we accept that proposition?
MR. FARR;

I think what that does is that it gives

the Federal Court jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians
in Indian Country.
QUESTION:

As long as you can surmount the

difficulty, too.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FARR:

Assuming that these are legitimately

Indian Country and that Congress had the power to make them
Indian Country, then that is right.
QUESTION:

This does not go to exclusivity, then?

MR. FARR:

No, at this particular point it does not

need to, although 1 should point out at this time that generally
the federal jurisdiction over crimes involving Indians in In­
dian Country is exclusive of state jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

But if you have created an Indian

13
Reservation and then just put non-Indians on it, the federal
courts would not have exclusive jurisdiction on any crimes,
MR, FARR:

The reason \tfould be, though, because

that, is something that Congress could not validly do, as I will
explain in just a moment but if, indeed, this is an Indian
Reservation that Congress was entitled to establish or a depen­
dant Indian community that Congress was entitled to establish,
then it seems that the normal jurisdictional rules which are
that the federal courts have jurisdiction over the crimes com­
mitted by Indians or involving Indians to the exclusion of the
state should apply,

I do not see any reason why they should

not.
QUESTION:

Would you say that the normal jurisdic­

tional rule that an Indian living in Phoenix, Arizona off the
Indian Reservation who has lived in Phoenix for 50 years is
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court
there for crimes he may commit in violation of state law?
MR. FARR:
that.

No, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, I do not say

What I am saying is that he would not be living in

Indian Country by the very hypothesis that you put forward,
QUESTION:

So Indian Country is essential to your

That is right.

argument.
That is what gives the

federal courts jurisdiction over these areas and that would
include Reservations and independent Indian communities.

QUESTION:

But a non-resident Indian does not live
He comes on the Reservation for a day and

It would be within the reach of this statute.

MR. FARR:

That is somewhat of an unsettled question,

whether the federal court, whether the jurisdiction in Indian
Country in 1152 and 1153 applies to people who have no connec­
tion with the Indian Reservation or the dependent Indian com­
munity where they are found is something that this Court noted
in Antelope is left open.
But that certainly is not the case here.

If these

lands are a Reservation or a dependent Indian community, cer­
tainly Smith .John was a member of that community, or a member
i

of the Band living on the Reservation.
QUESTION:

But you said, as has been suggested by

my Brother White, there are at least two issues here? first of
all, whether or not territorial -- well, at least two issues,
probably three or four or five — whether or not there is
territorial jurisdiction.
Second, if so, is that exclusive?
And thirdly, even though there are the territorial
9

jurisdictions, can there be federal jurisdiction over these
people t^ho were, years age*, made non-Tribal members and citisens of Mississippi?
MR. FARR:

All right, I think that those may be

separated out although I think the third in this case really is

15
sort of a false issue.

I think that our position succinctly

stated is that there is —
QUESTION:

You hope it is.

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

You hope it is.

MR. FARR:

Well, I certainly hope it is.

But I

also think it is and our position is that federal jurisdiction
is — that the federal courts do have jurisdiction over these
lands because it is Indian Country but that jurisdiction,, as
in normal use of federal lands and in normal situations in­
volving Indian Country or dependent Indian Communities, is
exclusive of state jurisdiction and finally, that they do have
jurisdiction over Smith John himself, who is the only person
at issue here because he is a member of the Band that occupies
those lands.
QUESTION:

That is a little circular, is it not?

QUESTION:

Well, also, you left —•

MR. FARR:

I thought it was as straight a line as —■

QUESTION:

Yes, you hope it is.

Do you have exclu-

sive jurisdiction over the Reservation because he is there and
living on it?

Do you have strict jurisdiction over it?

MR. FARR;

Well, I agree, one has to follow from

the other but you can follow in a straight line, not necessarily
in a circle.
QUESTION;

And you say they have jurisdiction over

16
Smith John because he is a member of the Band living there but
still you have to answer the claim of the State that no matter
if he be such, years ago he was declared not to be a member of
any Tribe and much less a member of -MR. FARR:

Well, let be go ahead with that because •—

QUESTION:

-— or a citizen of Mississippi and it is

too late now to reincorporate him in as a member of some Tribe.
MR. FARR:

Well, I do not think it is too late.

QUESTION:

Well, I know you don't but that is part

of your case, too.
MR. FARR:

That is correct.

That is correct.

The notion that the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek
in 1830 somehow set in stone the relationship between the
Choctaws and Mississippi and the Federal Government X do not
think is supported by any authority.

It is true that the treaty

apparently contemplated that the Choctaws who did not go to the
Western Terricory would stay behind, would receive land and
would presumably fend for themselves as citizens of?the State
of Mississippi.
The United States certainly did not in the treaty,
surrender explicitly any power to help them if that proved to
ba unworkable and the State of Mississippi, of course, is not
entitled to rely on any promises there, anyway, because it was
not a party to the treaty.

It was not made for their benefit.

Even if the Treaty could somehow be read to include

17
that sort of promise by the United States, it is clear from the
decisions of this Court that Congress can amend treaties by
later treaties and by subsequent legislation and it would seem
to me extremely curious, as well as unfortunate, if that prinei
pie, which has often been used to change treaties over the
Indians' objection was now somehow unavailable to change a
treaty for their benefit and with their acquiescence.
Now, the point that Justice White makes is that
after that period of time they were no longer a Tribe and there
fore that Congress', as I understand it, constitutional power
had somehow lapsed over the Choctaws.
But I think that is too grudging a view of Congress'
power in Indian Affairs.

Tribal existence, like tribal sover­

eignty, provides the necessary backdrop for viewing the rela­
tionship between the American Indians’ and the Federal Govern­
ment but this Court has already recognized that a continuing
tribal existence is not a sine qua non

of Congressional power

to deal with Indian Affairs.
For example, in the case that we have discussed in
our brief, in McGowan, the Court approved the exercise of
Congressional jurisdiction over lands purchased for Indians
in Nevada, many of whom were not members of an established
Tribe at that point.
Indeed, logically, if Congress lost its power to
provide for the Indians.at the instant that an individual

18
Indian severed his tribal relationship or the Tribe for sores
reason, disbanded, it would completely prevent Congress from
experimenting with .independence of the Tribe because once the
Tribe gained some measure of independence, to that degree,
Congress would lose its ability to correct the situation if the
Tribes were unable to cope with that independence.
QUESTION:

Mk. Farr, in McGowan the Federal Govern­

ment rather expressly did not assert exclusive jurisdiction.
MR. FARR:

Well, when we are talking again about

exclusive jtirisdi-etion, this is the point I made originally,
the type of jurisdiction they are asserting there is not the
exclusive jurisdiction that you get under the Arsenals and
Dockyards clause, for example, if the state consents to give
it to you where basically you become the full, entire sovereign
for that area and the state just keeps out — with some limited
exceptions.
What we are saying here is that as this Court recog­
nised in Surplus Trading Company versus Cook, that the state
continues to be a sovereign over these areas.

It continues to

have pertain sovereign rights over these areas.
What the state does not have — and this is exactly
what the Court said in Surplus Trading Company by way of
example — what this case does not have is full sovereignty
over the Indian wards.

The Federal Government has the sovereign­

ty and to that extent it premepts that bit of state sovereignty.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Farr, suppose that the Federal

Government just decided that there were some underprivileged
people in the community and we will just buy them some federal
land out in Arizona or some place and move these people onto
the Reservation?

Indian.

MR. FARR:

If they are not Indians, they can’t do it.

QUESTION:

So you rely strictly on the fact of the

And what provision of the Constitution do you rest on?
Do you keep the state on which to ground federal

power to exclude the state?
MR. FARRs

It is grounded on the provision to regu­

late commerce with the Tribes, the treaty-power making with
the Tribes and the powers that flow from that that this Court
has recognized in numerous cases.
QUESTION:

Would your answer be any different if the

Indians were moved to Colorado rather than Arizona?
MR. FARR:

No, it would not.

I mean, the Court --

QUESTION:

Well, what would

your answer be if they

gave New York back, Manhattan?
MR. FARR:

If they gave — assuming that the Indians

would taka it, I mean, it seems to me that their power to deal
with the Indians at all depends on some sort of original Tribal
nexus.

This Court in Sandoval said that Congress can not

necessarily •—
QUESTION:

Well, they Indians did own 'Manhattan,

2G
didn't they?

And there are Indians there now.

They are the

guys that climb the skyscrapers.
.MR. FARR:

That may be but on the issue of the Indian

power, the Court did say in Sandoval that Congress could not
exercise that power simply by arbitrarily calling a group of
people an Indian Tribe.
QUESTION:

No, I am talking about the Secretary of

the Interior.
MR. FARR:

Well, the Secretary of the Interior —

QUESTION:

He is referring to Mississippi by in­

cluding it in New York.
MR. FARR:

Well, he can do it if Congress authorizes

it and Congress has authorized it.
.

QUESTION:

>

Congress has not authorized it in

Mississippi.
MR. FARR:

Well, under the Indian Reorganisation

Act it did authorize, Congress did certain things directly and
authorized the Secretary of the Interior to do the rest under
the Indian Reorganization Act so he did have that authorization.
But back to the Sandoval point for a second.

The

Court said,"You cannot just call anybody —"

of it.

QUESTION:

What does it depend on, blood?

MR. FARR:

No.

Well, blood would certainly be part

It depends, as the Court said there, on a distinctly
#

Indian community.

21

QUESTION;

Well, just anyone cannot join the Tribe

and be recognised as an Indian.
MR. FARR;

That is correct.

I cannot.

You know, I

have no Indian grounding and in fact, the Indian Reorganisation
Act applies only to Indians of one-half or more Indian blood
but it is a distinctly Indian community and the Mississippi
Choctaws have a common history, they have common heritage, they
have common customs and they have a common language.
In 1918, when Congress began legislating for the
Choctaws, they had a report from the agent in front of them
that said every one of the Choctaws still spoke Choctaw and
many of them spoke it as the only language so this is not a
group of Indians that has been completely -- I am sorry?
QUESTION:

You had better limit that to Mississippi

MR. FARR:

You are right.

Choctaws.
I had better limit that

to Mississippi Choctaws and that is who I am talking about.
QUESTION:

Because the former Chief Judge of the

Court of Criminal Appeals in Oklahoma, which is a rather high
office, was a Choctaw.
MR. FARR;

Well, I am speaking and I apologize for

not being precise in my answer, I am speaking of the Mississippi
Choctaws but you know, Congress recognised at that time that
they had not been assimilated into Mississippi society.

As

this Court said in Winston versus Amos, they were denied all

22
political social privileges and their children could not go to
the state schools so it is not clear how they were going to be
assimilated, even if that had been the purpose of the

actions

prior to that time so I do not think that, although there
clearly are limits to the power, to reach out and just find
someone in general non-Indian society, even if he has a very
distant Indian ancestry and pulling within the reach of the
power, it does not seem to me that that is the situation in
/

this case.
QUESTION:

Are the communities exclusively Indian,

the so-called"Indian communities"that you are talking about?
MR. FARR:

The dependent Indian communities?

I

do not think it would be necessary that they absolutely be
populated by only Indians?
QUESTION:

I did not ask you that.

I asked you,'

are they or are they not exclusively Indian?
MR. FARR:

Well, I think that •—

QUESTION:

The community you are talking about is an

They are exclusively enough Indians so

area.

that they have that distinctively Indian character.

That is

what I am saying.
QUESTION:

But there is land in the community that

is owned by other non-Indians?
MR. FARR:

In this case there is virtually none and

23

X think that is generally the rule* that the land is generally
held for the Indians themselves»

Here the United States, in

the lands that they have declared a Reservation, is holding
those in trust for the Choctaw Indians and not for anybody else.
QUESTION:

This is all federal land, is it not?

MR. FARR:

This is all federal land.

QUESTION:

Pederal-owned land.

QUESTION:

Well, would your argument extend to a

checkerboard situation such as we have had in a couple of the
Reservation cases?
MR. FARR:

Yes, it would»

I

mean, checkerboarding

is an incident of certain actions that Congress takes and it is
not always the most desirable thing.

It might for simplicity's

sake be better to have all the lands everywhere bunched by
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Don’t we have a checkerboard design in
■

..

.

any case?
MR. FARR:

In this case there are Indian lands and

then there are lands that are non-Indian and the jurisdiction
varies between the two.

That is correct but I think that is

somewhat of a make-weight argument in the sense that you had
that in Rosebud.

You had that in DeCcteau.

It is simply an

incident of some things that Congress does without specifically
addressing or perhaps without caring about the effect of
checkerboard jurisdiction.

1151(c) gives you checkerboard

jurisdiction every­

where it applies —
QUESTION:

Mr„ Parr, before you sit down, the one

petitioner, the individual petitioner, has died?
MR. FARR:

That’s right, Harry Smith John has died.

QUESTION:

And is the case moot as to him, now?

MR. FARR:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. COLLINS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF SMITH JOHN
MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Our position on the basic Indian Country issue in
the case is the same as the United States' and I shall endeavor
not to repeat Mr. Farr's arguments because we essentially agree
with them.
I would like to say a few words in opening about the
people that we are referring to as the Mississippi Band of
Choctaw Indians as I think it is relevant to this case.
The contemplation of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit
Creek, as the state correctly points out, was that the Choctaws
would

either move to Oklahoma or assimilate and I think it is

important to point out that there are really three groups of
descendants from those people: those that moved to Oklahoma

25

that obviously have no relevance to this case; those that
stayed in Mississippi who did assimilate and intermarry with
other Mississippi citizens and those who did not assimilate
who are not all the descendants; only those who remained a
separate and distinct Indian community — an Indian community
most of the members of which were entirely of Indian ancestry
continued to speak the Choctaw language, continued to practice
traditional Choctaw social customs and relationships.
And in 1918 when the United. States came in and recog­
nized that assimilation as to this particular group had not
worked, at that time, Your Honors, the State of Mississippi, in
I think a significant way, recognized the distinct nature of
this group of people because the State of Mississippi was then
providing public schools for white Mississippi children and
black Mississippi children and even Chinese Mississippi children
but not for this group of people.
They were the only people in Mississippi not entitled
to go to any public schools.

One of the reasons for the res­

toration of the federal assistance to them was this rather
unique status that they had, recognized by the state in that
manner.
The -- turning for a moment, then, to the Indian
Country questions that have already been discussed, I would
like to respond to a question raised by Mr. Justice Rehnquist
concerning the relationship between the Indian Country statute

26

and the decisions of this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Collins, before you do, can I go

back to your last point about the two different groups of Choc­
taws that remained behind, those which were assimilated and
those which were not?

You pointed out those which were not

assimilated could not go to school.
What about those which were not assimilated?
MR, COLLINS:

I believe that, as I understand it,

Mr. Justice Stevens, the people who assimilated would join the
white community or the black community depending on which group
they had intermarried with and they are treated as members of
those communities today, essentially.
The people who remained distinctly Indian are the
people I am talking about.
QUESTION:
Indians.

In other words, they are full-blooded

Is that the line that Mississippi drew?
You are relying entirely on the line that Mississippi

drew in deciding who was eligible for public education.
MR. COLLINS:

Well, Your Honor, as you would suppose,

there were occasional Indian people, I am sure, scattered
throughout Mississippi but the people who maintained traditional
Tribal relations were concentrated in one part of Mississippi,
around Philadelphia and they are the ones that we are concerned
with here.
We are not concerned with isolated individuals

27

elsewhere, some of whom may even he of substantial Indian an­
cestry.

The people that remained in these communities are

largely full-blood even today, almost all.

Although the statu­

ta ry definition under the IRA is half-blood and that is the
legal definition for this Band,
QUESTION;

And we are, of course, concerned with

several noncontiguous areas, too.

Would you say this third

group is characteristic of all the non-contiguous areas that
are now on the Reservation?
HR. COLLINS;

You are referring to the land status

now, sir?
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. COLLINS;

The lands that are trust lands, that

were purchased for the Mississippi Choctaws by the government
beginning in 1913 at at seven locations where the Choctaws were
largely concentrated before the land purchase program began.
The seven villages or communities are distinctly
Choctaw communities.

The population of those communities is

over 98 per cent Choctaw and those that are not are either
government employees or spouses of a few .Choctaws»
The land ownership within those communities is some­
what. fragmented.

It was quite fragmented in 1944.

The govern-

ment and the Tribe, I believe, have worked toward consolidation
of the land but —
QUESTION:

You mean, to exclude nonlndian ownership?

28

MR. COLLINS:

They have worked to exchange lands.

I

think it is done mostly by exchange., Mr. Justice White, to
exchange lands to make the lands more contiguous.
entirely succeeded.
lands.

That has not

There is some disjunctive nature of the

However, it seems to us that the statutes contemplate

that in part with the definition of Indian Country in 18 USC
1151(b) which says, dependent Indian communities are Indian
Country and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Martina
case, which we have cited in our brief, ruled that a community
very much like these is Indian Country under I think rather
similar circumstances.
Also, we would point out that disjointed land owner­
ship has been a feature of Indian Country for many purposes
In the McGowan case, the Court sustained Indian
Country status for a piece of land purchased in Nevada for
Nevada Indians and that is my point about the relationship
between the statute and the Court’s decision.

The Court ren­

dered four or five decisions defining Indian Country between
1913 and 1938 and it is very clear from the legislative history
of tha 1948 statute that Congress was codifying those decisions;
it was recognising those decisions as a law and putting them
into the statute books.
So ,1 think -there is a very close relationship be­
tween the statutes and the decision which makes the decisions,
even though they are prior to tha statute, quite relevant to

29

its meaning«
QUESTION:

They were codified in the Indian Reorgani

zation Act?
MR. COLLINS:

No* Your Honor* in the Indian Country

statute of 1948, the statute defining what is Indian Country,
QUESTION:

Was that at the time the entire federal

statute law was codified?
MR. COLLINS:
that time.

Was it called the 1948 revision?
Yes, except this statute ivas new at

I realize that most of that 1948 codification was

a codification of existing statutes but there was no existing
Indian Country statute at that time except for an obscure por­
tion of the Liquor Statutes which said that allotments were
Indian Country.
Other than that, the only definition of Indian
Country in federal law prior to 1948 was essentially the deci­
sions of this Court.

It was treated as a common law issue,

except for this one liquor statute which included allotments.
But the definition of allotments in the Indian
Country statute which, again, as I emphasized, codified prior
decisions of this Court.
That is, 18 USC 1151(c) obviously contemplates some
disjointed .land ownership and I think Congress has made its
decision that Indian Country may so exist.

The Court has al­

most explicitly recognized that in the DeCofceau decision just
a few years ago and therefore, we do not see that that is any

30

disability with regard to this land, the lands involved here
being Indian Country.
In fact, the tracts of land recognised by the Court
as Indian Country by McGowan was I believe about 28 acres and
the tracts of land on which the crime we are concerned with
here occurred is over 300 acres so as far as identifying an
area as Indians9 land, there would be less difficulty in this
instance.
The principle argument that the state raises is that
the United States by entering into the 1830 scheme irretrieva­
bly lost its authority over the Choctaw Indians in Mississippi.
In response, we contend that the actions of the
United States since 1918 very clearly evidence an intent on
the part of both Congress and the Executive Department to re­
cognize again a portion of the descendants of the Choctaw peopie who were involved in 1830 who already said, "We think that
that kind of authority has been continuously and unanimously
recognized by the courts since the beginning of the Republic
until the two cases below." They are the first time I can find
where the United States, the political departments of this
ever
government have/been disabled from dealing with people who were
manifestly American Indians.
QUESTION:

Do you think that if the Executive Branch

and Congress said that "We have great sympathy for the plight
of the remaining Choctaws in Mississippi and therefore,

31

whereever they may reside in Mississippi they shall be immune
from the Mississippi Criminal Code."
MR. COLLINS;
question, of course.

Your Honor,, that is a more difficult

There was a power rather similar to that

exercised by the Congress for the period from 1862 until 1953
and that was the prohibition against anyone selling alcoholic
beverages to any Trust Indian, anywhere in the United States.
That was repeatedly sustained by this Court.
I do not think we need to reach questions that -QUESTION:

Well, my hypothesis goes beyond a Trust

Indian.
MR. COLLINS:

Well, by Trust Indian, what I meant

was, that statute said, ’’Any Indian who is enrolled at an
Indian Agency."

That was the definition, you know.

QUESTION:

Well, my hypothesis goes beyond any

Indian who is enrolled in an Indian agency and simply says,
"Anyone who can prove to the satisfaction of the court trying
the criminal case in this state that he is of Indian blood
shall have a complete defense to the criminal charge."
MR. COLLINS:

That goes beyond any question that has

ever been presented to a criminal court and does present a
difficult problem but I think we are so far from it that I do
not think that that kind of situaion really applies here be­
cause —
QUESTION:

Well, do you have an answer to it one way

32
or the other?
MR. COLLINS;

I am quite uncertain, Your Honor.

I

think a fair argument can be made that the power is justified
by the Constitution and that the Court, should not overturn it.
What one might say about it is that that sort of exercise of
the power would be unwarranted but there are many exercises of
legislative and executive authority that appear unwise but the
courts have no authority to overturn.
I rather think that would be my opinion, in answer
to your question.
It would depend in part on how one defined Indian.
If you meant anyone descended from an American Indian Tribe,
as my client is, then I would answer yes, the authority lies
and the courts have no power to overturn it.
One of the main reasons that we feel that

.■*"

no question about federal authority is that the Court has con­
sistently left this question of recognizing who are Indians
under the federal authority to the political departments of
the government and it is absolutely unprecedented to have the
courts second-guessing that question.
The government responsibility is based on initial
political relation with an Indian Tribe but once there is an
Indian Tribe, as there clearly was with the Choctaws, the Court
has not held and should not hold that fragmentation or even
termination of a Tribe cannot be undone if the Government later

33

determines that the policy was unwise.
The federal policy with regard to Indians has
obviously often split Tribes, fragmented Tribes by war, con­
quest, treaty or otherwise and what we contend has consistently
been recognized by decisions of this and the other federal
courts is that the United States can deal with the results of
those actions.
Where the United States takes actions that result in
the splitting or fragmenting of a tribe, the United States does
not by those actions lose power to deal with the results.

In

fact, the Indian people who are affected by actions like that
are often those most in need as is well-illustrated by the
record in this case.
This Court sustained the constitutionality of the
Indian Major Crimes Act, the statute that is basically at issue
here, in 1886 in the decision in the United States against
Kagatna and in that very decision the Court recognized, I think,
the principles that control this case.
The decision referred expressly to the remnants of
a race once powerful.

The word "remnants,*' which one might use

to describe the remnants of the Choctaw Tribe of Mississippi,
that we are dealing with here was used by the Court in that
opinion.

Furthermore, the facts of that case are rather similar.

It was a Reservation established well after California had
become a state on lands that were set aside after California

34
had become a state and if you will, I suppose there was an in­
terim between 1350 when California became a state and sometime
after that when the Reservation was set aside when those Indians
were technically under state jurisdiction, just as the people
wa are dealing with here.
Farther more in that case, the Court noted very ex
plicitly that the government is empowered to deal with Indians
in part as the result of the consequences of conquest of the
Indians.

The Court explicitly noted that conquest has rendered

the Indians dependent.

I believe the Court emphasised that in

the recent decision in the Oliphant case, that conquest ren­
dered the Indians dependent on the United States and that de­
pendence was relied on in the Kagama decision interpreting this
very statute as giving the United States authority to deal with
Indians in the manner that we are talking about here, to pro­
vide a criminal code for them.
If that action, if the action of 1830 were deemed
irreversible, as Mississippi contends, it would severely hamper
federal policy, would allow no corrective action.

It would

cause problems elsewhere because that kind of reassertion of
power has occurred elsewhere and we contend that there is no
precedent for it.
I would next like to point out that when the Major
Crimes Act jurisdiction exists, when there is federal court
jurisdiction as exercised here by the United States Circuit

35

Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to prosecute my
client; when that exists* this court and all the other federal
courts have always held that that authority is exclusive of
state authority over the same crime, that it precludes or pre­
empts state authority over the same crime.
This Court has twice held that as a holding, in the
Seymour case and in Rice against Olson, which we cited.

The

lower federal courts have held it in numerous circumstances.
The Court has noted it in dictum frequently, most
recently in the Antelope case.

We can see no reason why

Mississippi is any different in this regard from any other state
in the union.

The fact that the Indians involved were for a

time under state jurisdiction does not serve to distinguish the
situation in other states.
As I have pointed out, there have been frequent
examples in the history of the country where Indians were for a
time under state authority but federal jurisdiction to estab­
lish a Reservation was then asserted and they came under federal
jurisdiction and that authority has been sustained by the courts.
In conclusion, we agree with the United States that
this land was Indian Country.

If it is Indian Country, the

Major Crimes Act on its face applies.
jurisdiction.

The Federal Court has

We contend that the subsequent state prosecution

for precisely the same offense was' therefore preempted by valid
federal authority and that the conviction — judgment of

36

conviction entered by the Mississippi court should be reversed.

more closely.

they were Cajuns or of French descent.

QUESTION:
MR. ANDRE:

Would you say —

That is true,

-- that it came under —
That is true because, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, we state that Congress deals with the Indian Tribes
and that there must be this Tribal consideration which goes
down through history and we start off and let the treaties with
the Choctaws from 1798, the treaties with the Choctaw Tribe —
we look at the Indian Removal Act just prior to the Treaty of
Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 -- the removal of Choctaw Tribes,
Indian Tribes to the West.
QUESTION:

Well, you are assuming that once a Tribe

disintegrates that it can never be restored to Tribal status.
MR. ANDRE:
QUESTION:
MR. ANDRE:

Yes.

Yes.

What is your authority for that?
Simply because to do otherwise, you are

getting into racial law, which it is my understanding is not —
QUESTION:

You have not given us any authority for

this idea that a Tribe may not restore itself to tribal status,
assuming that the federal authority takes the appropriate steps
which they claim to have taken.
MR. ANDRE:

Perhaps it could be done under certain

situations and it might be reorganized on a bilateral basis

42
between if a group of Indian descendants got together and
attempted to organize and then petitioned the Congress for some
sort of corporation or some corporate status or something like
that# then it could possibly evolve into a situation but to
purely and simply take a group of people or the descendants of
people who had become citizens of a state and were treated as
other citizens of the state for almost 100 years, as individuals and then to set them up as a new Tribe which, in fact, it
was becau.se there was no organization to these people ther^ in
Mississippi, there until about 1934 or 1935 and then there were
two conflicting organizations which, as I understand from author
ities, the Bureau of Indian Affairs favored one and breathed
life into them and it followed with a proclamation of the Secre­
tary of the Interior in 1944»
QUESTION;

Have you not almost described a restora­

tion of a disintegrated Tribe by what you have just said?
MR. ANDRE:

But there must ba some legislative ce­

ment to hold the argument together, Your Honor, and that is
missing in this case for this reason;
If they are relying on the Indian Reorganization Act
of 1934, it addresses itself to Tribal Reorganization and other
matters and states

such things as, "A majority of the Tribe

may agree to come under this."
There was no list that I can find of any particular
Choctaw Tribe in Mississippi at that time.

These were

43
individuals living hither, thither and yonder, as we have said.
There was not Tribe — What is the majority of a number that
today ranges between 3 and 5,000 people?

It is an indefinite,

impossible situation.
Then we find another peculiarity.

The Relief Act of

1918 which Congress, the first time as far as I know that Con­
gress had recognized any Indians in Mississippi directly since
1830 provided for certain relief and the purchase of land to be
sold to the Choctaws on a repayable basis.

This is where the

land purchase started because the Choctaws took the land but
did not pay for it and the Government repossessed.

This in

turn produced the 1939 Act to clarify the land title as to who
should have title to the land?
So in the 1934"s it is, to me, an impossible situa­
tion to suggest that a group of people across the state could
satisfy the basic requirements of coming together in an organi­
zation and getting the majority of them to approve by a proper
election, et cetera.
What I was going to say is that the 1918 Act addres­
sed itself to whole-blood Choctaws.
The Indian Reorganization Act addressed itself to
ha .1 f-blood Choctaws.
The record is devoid of any anthropological study or
otherwise
biood.

to determine who is a whole-blood and who is a half-

Presumably they had something to go on because some 10

44
years before 1918, acting under the Dawes Commission authority,
agents had gone into Mississippi and attempted to round up and
get together various people of Choctaw descent so that they
could join the Tribe in Oklahoma and that is where the Tribe
and the Tribal Authority that Congress dealt with had been
since 1830 removal from Mississippi»
Congress has not created any Tribal status for
Mississippi Choctaws.

The Act that the Secretary of Interior

relied on did not address itself to Mississippi Choctaws.
This Court reviewed the entire status of Mississippi
Choctaws in 1921 in Winton versus Amos and listed at length the
whole history of the Tribe.

There is no point in repeating

all that today but sufficient to say, there were absent any
Congressional direct action from 1930 until 1918.
QUESTION:

Mr. Andre, could I interrupt, sir?

Be­

cause I think the Court of Appeals relied so heavily on the
absence of any authority in the 1934 Act.
Why is not Section 46? sufficient?

It says in words,

"The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to proclaim
new Indian Reservations on lands acquired pursuant to any au­
thority conferred by various sections.

Well, did it not do

exactly that?
MR. ANDRE:

Correct, Your Honor but you have to

address yourself to the overall purpose of the Indian Reorgani­
zation Act which was to reorganize Tribes and possibly get them

45
out from under the Bureau of Indian Affairs -— or at least the
domination of the Bureau of Indian Affairs»
QUESTION:

Would you agree that the language of the

statute as read literally does cover the situation?
MR. ANDRE:
QUESTION:

Cover our situation?
Yes.

MR. ANDRE:

No, sir, I do not take it that it covers

our situation.
QUESTION:

MR.

Then I just wanted to know why not?

ANDRE: Because I

think we do not have a Tribe

in Mississippi in 1934 subject to that Act \>7hich says that any
is
Tribe on a Reservation/under the jurisdiction of the United
States Government.
no Reservation.

We had no Tribe in Mississippi.

There was

The Choctaws there were under the jurisdiction

of the State and had been since 1830.
QUESTION:

Which section of the statute limits the

power of 467 to new Reservations for preexisting Tribes?

I

mean, what is it in the statute that supports your argument?
You just quoted the statute very directly.
MR.

ANDRE: According

to the statute, the Indian

Reorganization Act, according to the authorities and Law Jour-’
rial articles, et cetera, Coyne’s Indian Affairs — Handbook of
Indian Law and others state that the purpose of an Indian Reorganisation Act was to — had several purposes:

One, to stop

the practice of Indian land allotments , where Indians were

46
land individually and were suffering a loss -- to permit the
Tribes to come out from under the domination or complete con­
trol of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and back independently in
their own affairs.
And therefore it

directed itself to at least the

nucleus of some Tribe or something that can be said to be a
Tribe.

Also it says, if I am not mistaken, it says to Tribes

on an Indian Reservation.
There were many Reservations at that time, all ovet.
T 3 Tribal organization, the various Indians os* th.-itt vailed.
In soma places it was highly organized.

In some places it was

not.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is, the statute made -

you could only create a new
preexisting location to a
MR. ANDRE:

Reservation by moving one from a
new location.

Is that basically —

I suspect that that was put in to buy

additional lands in such places as Oklahoma and the West.
I suspect that.

I do not say.

As Coyne states it,

The Indian Reorganization Act was finally put together, it was
sort of a compromise between the Senate and the House variation
and you have to be a little wary in making any positive state­
ment about it at all.
I think one more point is necessary.

We have talked

here this morning about wardship, guardianship over Indians.
The Choctaw Indians of Mississippi lived in close proximity to

47
the European settlers in the area from 1699 forward.

At the

time of the ‘Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek they were not an un­
tutored group of people.

They are not today.

True, their for­

tunes are mixed, just as the fortunes of black Amaricans, white
Americans, Chinese Americans and others in Mississippi have
mixed economic and educational fortunes.

Mississippi there may not have been any schools in the early
part of the 1900's.

Yes but if there were public schools,

they were not allowed to go to them.

position of the government attempts to apply acts of the Depart»

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. COLLINS, ESQ.
MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I have three replies.
First, in answer to the last question on schools.
Until 1968, the Mississippi Choctaw children were attend a
Bureau of Indian Affairs in Mississippi [school]' until the
eighth grade, at which time they

would go to federal Indian

50

schools in Oklahoma to attend high school.
QUESTION:

Why is that?

By preference or were they excluded from Mississippi
high schools?
MR. COLLINS:

In the part of Mississippi in which

they they are concentrated where these schools exist, I think
everyone has assumed that that is a proper way of things.

I do

not think there have been any challenges to the system so one
cannot say that if there had been a challege or if there had
been an attempt that they might not have been admitted but I
am informing the Court of the way it was.
I cannot say precisely why it was.
QUESTION:

Well, you cannot say, then, that Missis­

sippi ever excluded them from Mississippi schools?
MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, we have cited historical

tracts in our brief, particularly the tract by Mr. Peterson
that indicate that in 1918, at least, they were not admitted to
Mississippi schools and at that time the government established
federal schools for them for that very reason.
Subsequent to 1918 ali I know is that —
QUESTION:

But you have never read a statute or a

rule or anything else, that ever banned them from Mississippi
schools?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

There is a street in Phoenix named Indian

51
School Road and the reason it is named Indian School Road is
that there was a federal

Indian School from which Indians

from wide-ranging areas were sent by the Federal Government at
their choice, subject to my colleague Stewart's remarks that
maybe no child chooses to go to school but the issue really
never arose whether they could have gone to school in Apache
County or Navajo County since they all went to the Federal
Indian School in Phoenix»
MR. COLLINS;

That is correct, Your Honor and if we

had a continuous pattern of federal relationship with these
Indians, the matter would be precisely identical.
The only point I am making is that there is no
doubt —- I think the relevant point is this:

There is no

doubt that we have an identifiable group of Indian people.
,

Mississippi treated them as such.

i

Their government recognised

them as such and I think that is the relevant point and no
more.

I was not trying to make any more of it than that.
QUESTION;

We can judge the case

on the assumption

that they could have gone to Mississippi schools if they had
ever wanted to.

Is that it?

MR. ANDRE:
QUESTION:

After 1918, I do not. know, Your Honor,
No, before.

MR. COLLINS;

Well, according to the historical

sources I read, they were excluded.

Why that is so, I cannot

QUESTION:

I think you ought to look at the Missis­

sippi statutes back in those days.
MR. COLLINSs
QUESTION:

There were no statutes, Your Honor.

Ha.

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, I would further point out

that the Court's opinion in 1921 indicates that they were not
permitted to vote and there was no statute saying that they
should not be permitted to vote, either.
of situation.

It is the same kind

I am saying that Mississippi treated them as a

different group of people and we are saying that there is not
an irrational exercise of federal authority with regards to
people who are not identifiable as Indians.

They are identi­

fiable as Indians and that is ■—
QUESTION:

Your case is as good one way or another,

I take it, whether they were excluded from voting or going to
school or not; your case is not destroyed either way.
MR, COLLINS:

I agree.

Honor, that is absolutely correct.

As a legal matter, Your
The suggestion has been

made, as I understand it, that the federal authority is being
irrationally exercised in some manner and I am saying that that
:.s nor so and that these facts indicate that it is not so.
QUESTION:
and excluded from

But if they were excluded from schools

voting it would lend some support to your

argument that they were isolated into their restored Tribal
groups.

53
MR» COLLINS:
I agree, Your Honor»

Yes,, that is what I am referring to.

That is precisely it.

And the next point I wanted to refer to was the
Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 in response to Mr. Justice
Stevens8 question.

The 1934 Act of Congress referring speci­

fically to the Mississippi Choctaws indicates specifically in
its legislative history, as we have pointed out in our brief,
that the Indian Reorganization Act was thought by Congress in
1939 to apply to the Mississippi Choctaws because the legislative history indicates that one purpose of the Act was to enable
then to organize the Tribal Government pursuant to the Indian
Reorganization Act so Congress certainly thought that in 1939.
Secondly, the —QUESTION:

But you do not know what the educational

condition was in 1939 or whether they could go to public schools
or not?
y ■

MR. COLLINS:

-v

No, Your Honor, I do not.

I mean, I

knoxi? that in fact they ware attending federal schools, but I
do

not know the answer to that question.
Furthermore, I would point out to the Court that

there is a consistent pattern of administrative enforcement of
this stattate that indicates that it applies to the Mississippi
Choctaws including an opinion of Assistant Solicitor Felix
Cohan that is included in the government’s petition and then
finally, I would mention that the seven communities in which

54
the Choctaws live are identifiable in Mississippi as Choctaw
communities.

No one has suggested that people in the area we

are talking about do not know which is a Choctaw community and
which is not. and in fact* they are clearly identifiable and
known to local citizens.
QUESTION;

In these communities., is there any fee

land at all?
MR, COLLINS:

As I understand it, Your Honor, and

this is not in the record, over 90 per cent of the lands in the
communities is federal land.

There is a bit of fee land here

and there, but very little is enclosed within the communities.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 11:53 o’clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
