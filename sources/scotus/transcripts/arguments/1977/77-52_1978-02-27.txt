MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 77-52, United States against Ford.
Mr. Frey, you may 'proceed whenever you are ready ,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF .\NDRBW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Court:
This case is here on the grant of the Government"s
petitio»

for writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the

United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which
.reversed respondent's conviction and ordered that the charges
againt him be dismissed on the ground that the speedy trial
provisions of Article IV(c) of the Interstate Agreement on
Retainers had been violated.
This cas© began when respondent and his no-defendant
robbed the Orance County Trust Company in Middletown, New York,
in October, 1371.

In November of that year a bench warrant

issued for respondent's arrest for that robbery.

H© was not

apprehended until nearly two years later whan federal agents
executing this and another federal warrant arrested him in
Chicago.
Because there were older, unrelated stated charges
from Massachusetts pending against

respondent, he was

extradited to that state, anc the federal bank robbery warrant

4
was .'.edged as a detainer with Massachusetts prison authorities.
Following his conviction and sentencing in Massachusetts to
imprisonment for a term of eight to ten years on the state
offense, an indictment was filed in the Southern District of
New York charging respondent with the bank robbery.
On April 1, 1974,

ie was produced for arraign, eht in

i:he Federal District Court in New York, pursuant to a writ of
habeas corpus ad prosequendam.

Shortly thereafter, a super~

seeing indictment was returned adding one -Tapes Flynn as a

:'o~

defendant and containing additional charges arising out of 'the
same series of transactions

surrounding the bank robbery.

Trial

was set for May 28, 1974.
However, co-defendant Flynn had not been apprehended,
:xc! ce May 17th the prosecutor moved for the first of what
was to be a series of continuances that ultimately postponed
respondent's trial to September 2, 1975.
In the meanwhile, at respondent's request, he was
returned to Massachusetts whore he remained until brought back
by fmother ad prosaquendam writ in August of 1975, shortly
before the trial.

At trial, respondent was convicted on all

count 2- and sentenced to concurrent terms of five years
imprisonment on each count which Judge Motley also specified
should be concurrent with his; state sentence.
I will not belabor this morning the details of the
various continuances since they ere wholly irrelevant, to the

5
issues before this Court.

I will mention only that throughout

'this proceeding the respondent did request a speedy trial on
a number of occasions,, but at no time prior to the appeal 'to
the Court of appeals did he mention or invoke the provisions
of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.
Da appeal a divided panel of the Second Circuit
reversed respondent's convictions, holding that Article IV(e)
of ’the Interstate Agreement 3» Detainers had been violated
because respondent's ferial hid been delayed for more than 120
days fro-.u the feline he was initially produced pursuant to the
writ for arraignment on th® original indictment, and because
although several of these continuances were granted for good
cause, subsequent continuances ware not for good cause or
violated the requirements of Article IV(c) because they were
not entered in open court or with respondent or his counsel
present.
Wo have not sought review hare of -the conclusion that
the speedy ferial provisions of the Interstate Agroonent, if
applicable, were violated in this case*

We do contest the

applicability of the provisions in the first place.
Accordingly, th© posture in which this case finds
.Itself before this Court is that there was a violation of th©
speedy trial provisions of the Detainer Agreement? but, by the
eam* tokem, it must be assumed that there was in this case no
violation of respondent's constitutional speedy trial rights

6
or of the rights afforded him under the prompt disposition
rules of the Southern District of New York because these
claims which respondent has consistently raised throughout
these proceedings were not. reached by the Second Circuit and
would be available to respondent on remand should the United
States prevail on the Detainer issues in this Court.
Both this case and the one that follows it this
morning, United States against Mauro-, involved important
questions concerning the application of Article IV of the
Interstate Agreement on Detainers to the situation in which
--he Federal Government utilises the writ ©f habeas corpus
ad prosequendam to secura the presence of © state prisoner
to stand trial on federal charges.
Wliile each case has issues that «are unique to it,
the bulk of my arguments this morning will relate to proposi­
tions that are equally pertinent to both cases, especially my
centre; 1 contention that the writ of habeas corpus ad
press queadaia is neither a detainer nor a request for temporary
custody under Article IV ©f

ih© Interstate Agreement on

Detainers.
Q

What was the position of the Court of Appeals

on that.: Mr., Frey, that thero has been an implied repeal of
tbs- body of lew relating to habeas corpus ad prosaquendam?
MR. FREY:

I am reluctant to characteri set it in terms

of what the Court's position was.

I think the Court looked to

7
the agreement itself rather than to the possible effect of the
agreement cn past practices; that is, it focused its attention
on what it conceived to be the evils that underlay the agree:aent and what it conceived to be the necessity of effectuating
the objectives of the agreement.
Q

Do you think it held that the agreement was ''the

only method after its passag3 by which the Federal Governs ant
could obtain prisoners?
MR. FREY:
Q

I think it did hold that.

Then is not tie answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist*s

question in the affirmative?
MR. FREY;

W© get into a semantic quibble over

whether this constitutes an implied repeal of the habeas
corpus writ or not»

The Court would simply say that the

writ still exists, that it simply now—
Q

It is at lease a restriction, is it not?

MR. FREY:

It is a substantial imposition of

additional conditions that a:re very significant but did not
c.tisr.d nr., us© of the writ before.

That is true.

l intend to proceed this morning by giving first a
brinf background of the problems that led to the promulgation
s £ the. Interstate Agreement on Detainers* ,• locking briefly ;;.t
the general structure of that agreement- and then proceeding
to set forth some of the reasons that we believe compel 'the
conclusion that the agreement was never meant to and should not

8
Id© construe3 to apply whan th® presence of a state prisoner
is procured in federal court by the traditional ad prosequendam
writ.

Because of the structure ©f these cases, I will try to

begin, after (A© introductory remarks, to discuss those factors
■shat are uniquely pertinent to th® Ford case and then pick
tip with my arguments that have general applicability

to both

cases, which will carry over into the succeeding narrower case.,
The Interstate Agreement on Detainers was an effort
by th© Council of State Governments to deal with the problem
that had come in th® 1940s aid 950s to be ©f increasing
concern to state law enforcement officials and prison adminis­
trators.

This problem arose in a situation in which an

individual serving a sentence of imprisonment in on® state
was wanted to face criminal charges in another state.
Prosecuting author ities in. the requesting state
encountered great, indeed often insurmountable difficulties
i.n securing the presence of such prisoners, which could only
be accomplished through curabor some extradition procedures or
special agreements between the executives of the two states
involved,

Because of the difficulties associated with these

procedures, it became common to defer the prosecution until
hh© defendant had completed nerving his sentence in the other
state.

In order to ensure that at that point the defendant,

would be turned ever to the requesting state rather than
l:©i<;g released, a notice known as a detainer would b® lodged

9

with the defendant's warden advising of the pendency of the
criminal charges and requesting delivery of the prisoner to
face those charges upon his release from the sentence h© was
then serving.
This system of deferred prosecution and detainers
generated many problems.

Judges attempting to sentence the

defendant in on© state against whom on® ©r more; detainers had
been lodged had difficulties knowing how to impose an appro™
pr.late sentence because they did not know what the disposition
of these other charges would be.

More relevant, to the agroo-

raent, prison and parole officials would encounter the same
uncertainties in attempting to plan a rational program of
rehabilitation.

And of course the prisoner himself might be

deprived of significant prison programs or parols opportun­
ities ?>:: z, consequence of the detainer whilti at Ui«s

fcims

t.e heid no way of bringing th a charges to trial so that the
uncertainties that they reflected could be resolved.
In addition, the system was subject to abuses.
iietairt j.ru wore easy to lodge, and it appears that they were
used oven though there may have been no serious prose­
cutive intention.

Indeed, in the substantial proportion of

c tsiis the? detainers apparently were dropped when the prisoner
was ready to be released iron his initial sentence of
i mpri s osaae at.

Tl.® Interstate Agreement on Detainers was thus

10
■proposed to serve the dual objectives of providing a simple
.and efficient procedure for prosecutors in one state to secure
•she presence for trial of a defendant imprisoned in another
stato while affording at the same time the prisoner a means of
clearing detainers by demanding and obtaining trial on out-ofsit&tts charges»
The concerns of the drafters of the agreement as I
have just outlined them were extensively canvassed in Judge
Mansfield’s opinion for the Court of Appeals in this case, and
we really have no quarrel with his account of them except for
the conclusion that he draws from them.
Q

Who were the draftors of the legislation?

Mh„ FREY;

The Council of State Governments conducted

a series of meetings beginning in 1949 and then resuming in
1.955 and 1956, which ware attended by various prison and
parole authorities, district attorney associations, and other
state and local government entities that were concerned with
th® problems.

And then the Council formulated the proposed

agreement along with a number of other matters that were of
common interest to states and publish them in a booklet called
"Suggeatod State Legislation Program."
Q

This is one for 1957.

Was there any participation by representatives

of th® Federal Government in this series of meetings?
MR. FREY:

At on© of the meetings there is an

indication in the report that Department of Justice

11
representatives participated.

I believe that Judge Garth's

opinion in the Thompson case suggests that these were Bureau
©f Prison representatives, which is the most likely group.
But I hav© not pinned down exactly who was 'there.

But that

was a fairly large meeting with over 60 people, including
somebody from the Department of Justice.
Gar quarrel with Judge Mansfield is not with this
history but with the fact that although the Council of State
Governments did contemplate federal adherence to this agree­

ment- “and the discussion sets forth some of 'the considerations
that relate to the production of federal prisoners--there is
absolutely no suggestion in She materials surrounding the
promulgation of the agreement that there was any consideration
V

given to the needs of federal prosecutors to have a new
mechanism for securing state prisoners to face trial on
federal charges.
I do not hav® time to g© into the agreement in
detail, but I would just like to say a word or two about it.
The critical

operative provisions of the agreement are

Article III and Article IV.

.Article ill sets forth the

procedures for the prisoner who wishes to demand trial on
charges contained in a detainer lodged against him.

Article

XXI(c) obligates the warden 1» inform the prisoner of a
detainer anc of his right to demand trial on it.

Article III(a)

provides that the prisoner demanding trial must be brought to

12
'trial within 180 days of delivery of his demand for the
prosecutor, requires the warden to attach a certificate along
with, the demand containing various information about the status
of his sentence in th© sending state*
Article 111(d)

contains among other things a

provision requiring that the indictment must be dismissed
with prejudice, that the prisoner is returned to the sending
stat® without having them ’tried after he is delivered to the
receiving or requesting stats.
Article IV sets forth the rules that are applicable
when the prosecutor invokes the agreement to obtain the
prisoner from another state for trial.

And both of the cases

this morning involve Article IV if 'they involve the agreement
at all.
Article XV(a) specifies that the prosecutor shall
deliver to riie; appropriate authorities of the state in which
th© prisoner is being held a written request fox* temporary
custody of the prisoner.

Article IV(c)

contains the speedy

trial provision relied upon by respondent in this case.
Article IV(n) contains the prohibition against return of the
prisoner prior to trial, subject t© the sanction of dismissal
with prejudice if the return in made prior to trial, which is
invoked by the respondents in the next case.
Article V then covers a number of housekeeping
details that; were important to the state, such as the management

13
of expenses, ensuring that the prisoner would receive credit
for his sentence from the sending state while he was in the
receiving state and so on.
The United States joined the agreement by act of
Congress in December, 1970.

Legislation was urged by the

Department of Justice and was adopted without recorded
opposition of. any kind.

It went into effect in March, 1971.

It proved to be a time bomb that ticked quietly away for
nearly five years and then exploded with the decision of
Judge Bartels in the Mauro case in December, 1975.

This sine®

generated a veritable landslide of litigation by state
prisoners seeking dismissal of federal charges against them.
The proper disposition of much of this litigation may turn on
the decision of the cases being heard today.

The quite

extraordinary potential for disruption of this pedestrianappearing piece of legislation becomes evident when on©
realises, that the Federal Government issues an estimated 5,000
ad_prc.segueadam writs annually for state prisoners, according
‘30 tbs» Marshal Service.

Incidentally, about 3,000 of these

involve cases in which a detainer has previously been lodged
«as in Ford and about 2,000 cases in which no detainer has
been previously lodged.
Since it is quit® clear that no on®, prosecutors,
courts or the defense bar, appreciated the possible applica­
tion of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers to these cases

14
before th® Mauro decision, these cases were routinely being
processed without regard to 'the prohibition against return to
state prison prior to trial and without regard to th© 120-day
and related speedy trial requirements of Article IV(c).

If

■th© United States loses th© cases being heard today and if it
is held that claims under tha Detainer Agreement can be raised
for th® first time in collateral attack, untold numbers of
convictions may be vulnerabis.
Q

The Justice Department was kind of asleep at

the*, switch in 1970, were the/ not?
MR. FREY:

I inten % to discuss later on—I do not

think we were asleep at the switch.
G

At least in nit',

seeing th© possibilities ©f

this very kind of litigation.
MR. FREY:

In that sense, that is right.

They

certainly did not perceive tie possibility that there would be
this problem.
Q

If your basic contention is right, that th©

Federal Government agreed to this only on th© basis of
uni .laterally being on only one side as between the sending
s;nd receiving state, there is just no indication at all, either
in the z;i xsamendatioh of the Justice Department or in the
nation of Congress, was there, of any such limitation?
MR. FREY:
limitation.

Thar© in no explicit statement of such a

But 1 do intend to go over later this morning th©

15
evidence which I think is absolutely plain, that there was no
affirmative intention, to bind the United States as a receiving
state.

And 1 would like to aake a point here, which is

important to keep in mind.

You do not have to hold today

for these cases ©r indeed to deal with most of the problems
that have been generated by the Interstate Agreement, on
Detainers in the federal context that the United States is not
a receiving state.

We have Bade that argument because we think

that will best harmonize the Detainer Agreement with the
Speedy Trial Act and the habeas corpus statute.
Q

If the Court iolds that this is not a request

but that it is a demand, as distinguished from a request, a
demand under the habeas corpus, unmodified, unaffected, by
Article IV, what does that do to this case?
M'l. PREY5

The government would prevail, and that is

•'di® point I was just going to make to Mr. Justice Stewart,
that the arguments—in our brief we advance 'the general
proposition, which I am now defending, that the United States
ought not to be treated as a receiving state at all.

But for

purpcsus of this case, the more important thing and one which
1 think is much less jurisprudentia1ly difficult is that the
writ; of habeas corpus is not a request end therefore—
Q

For purposes of this precise case , you also

have the waiver argument.
MR. PREY:

That is true, and I am going to coma to

16

that: shortly.
Q

But—
That does not get you very far along the line

of all these hundreds of casos you say are backed up. waiting
for this.
MR. FREYt

That will answer many cases because in the

past it was frequent not to raise them.

That will not,

however, deal the problems that will continue to be perpetuated
Into the fuuure by the agreement in terms of the interrelation­
ship with the Speedy Trial Act and the really substantial
difficulties that are created in trying to comply with the
no-return provisions of the act in the context where the
Federal Government is the presenting state, receiving someone
from another state.
Q

Mr. Frey, as another point, I hate to use the

phrase "get around,” but. how do you escape crossing the state
3.ire?

You do not have t© go through any removal proceeding

of any kind, do you?
MR.

freyi

I believe that is right..

The Government

■as never—the removal proceedings apply when a person is
«rested on the charge in the distant district.
Q

Right.

MR. FREY:

But the Interstate Agreement works no

change from past proceedings
Q

It. has never been litigated, has it?

MR. FRET;:

I am not aware of any cases that deal with

17
the right of the prisoner fee litigate his removal, the state
prisoner tc litigate his renoval.
Q

I am not talking about the prisoner litigating,

I am talking about the government having to litigate,
MR, FREY:

Thera has never bean a case in which there

has been a confrontation between the Government and e stats
warden

in which the supremacy clause issue, which has been

discussed in the briefs in this case, has really had to be
resolved.
Q

Mr, Frey, when a request is made., a request

under Article IV, what form does that, take?
MR. FREY:
Q

I have--

Compared with the writ now.

MR. FREY:

If I could briefly address the waiver

argument that—
Q

What X would Like to have you do is clarify

for me the difference between the request that is mads under
Article XV and the command that results from a writ of habeas
corpus issuing from a court.
MR. FREY:

I have asked the clerk 'to distribute to

the Justices-Q

VJ& have that.

MR. FREY:

—a document which is a—this is from

materials that were sent out by the Bureau of Prisons at the
viir

the United States

adhered to the Interstate Agreement

13

on Detainers, and it is from a package of forms which follow a
model proposed by the Council of State Governments when it
proposed the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, so that this is
a standard form of the kind that a federal warden might
receive when a state prosecutor is asking to have a federal
prisoner for trial»
Q

A function of the judge's signatur® on this is

an authentication, is it not’
MR. FREY;;

On this form the judge's signature 1

believe complies with the requirement of Article IV(a) of the
agreement that there be, if :: am recollecting—

Q

I am trying to distinguish between the judge's

signatures on this pises ©f paper, this form, and a judge's
signature on a writ of habeas.; corpus*
MR. FREY:

The rearon the judge’s signature is on

this form is that Article IV a) contains a proviso which
state-- that the court having the jurisdiction of the indictment
shall have duly approved, recorded, and transmitted the
request, and that is the designation that is here.
not a court order.
pros®cuter.

This is

This is § request that issues; from the

You will notice that it is labeled "Request for

temporary custody."
You will notice further that after th® listing of
offenses, there is a statement, “I propose to bring this
person te trial on this indictment, information, or complaint

19
within t-h® tin® specified in Article IV (c) of the agreement.1'
And in the next paragraph it says, ”1 hereby request temporary
custody of such persons pursuant to Article IV(a) of the
Agreement on Detainers."
Q

"The judge vouches that the facts are correct."

How can he do that?
MR. FREY;

The correctness of the facts for which he

is vouching is that there is an indictment, information, or
complaint on file, which is something that he can do.

This is

to prevent ‘the prosecutor--one of the problems under the old
detainer practice was that a prosecutor, even a police
officer, could lodge a detainer.

And the agreement requires

that a judge* certify that indeed there are such charges
pending and that indeed the verson who is making the request
is the responsible prosecuting officer.
Q

The signature of the Judge on this piece ©f

paper, the form you have filed with us, does not command anyone
to do anything, does it?
MU. FREY;

That is right,

it is just a certification

by ths judge End not an order* from the Court in any sense.
Q

Mr. Frey, is this a form that the Federal

Government has used?
MR. FREY:

No, the Federal Government—-this is a

form that was sent out to the wardens because it is the form
that w® have received from state prosecutors.

As far as I

20

know , we haws virtually—
Q

So, there would ba no occasion for a federal

•judge ever to sign this form.

So, you d© not have the

problem of differentiating a request from a habeas corpus
writ

Has any federal judge ever signed this form, to your

1 enow ledge?
MR. FREY:

I am advised that at some prisons in

Pennsylvania they have asked that we proceed by means of the
interstate Agreement on Detainers rather than by means of the
writ, and they reject the writ and ask for a request on this
form—
Q

What does the federal judge do in that district?

What is the federal practice in that district then?

Does it

use this form?
MR. FREY:

The practice is still to use the ad

prosequendam writ—
Q

The answer to my question is that as far as you

knew, no federal judge has ever signed this particular form?
MR. FREYs
Q

No, because if in fact—

I moan, it is a factual inquiry.

MR. FREY2

I am not'—

No, no, but l cannot tell you the answ&r

for sure, but I think that iu those instances where the state
asked for uo to proceed by moans of the request rather than
thfe write, we have gone to the judge and had him sign this
form and seat them a request.

So, to the extent that it has

21

been «sed then, the federal judge signing it has -treated the
United States as a receiving stata»
MR. FREY:
Q

If we used the request--

I am trying fca find out whether you did or not»

You kind of said you did not, but then you said maybe you did
.in one district.

I do not know what the answer is.

MR. FREY:

For purposes of my argument that the

writ is not a request—
Q
first.

I am trying to find out what the facts are

Per.laps the answer is you do not know.
MR. FREY:

I assume that the prosecutor in such a

case has proceeded under Article IV as though the United States
was the receiving state and las asked, the judge to act that
way.
Q

At least to tie extent that this form has been

used by the Federal Government, it has been used on the
assumption 'that the United S tates is the receiving state?
MR. FREY %

That is right.

I mean, we are prepared,

:: suppose—I mean, it is not a matter of standing on principi®
in these cases?

if the warden

of state prison wants us to

use the form and—
Q

And am I not also correct, with regard to the

Chief Justice’s questions about the distinction between a
commend ,2ad a request, that .In so far as the term "request"
in the Speedy Trial Act is concerned, that term is construed

22

oy the United States to cover the writ.
MR. FREY:

Is that not correct?

That is correct, but there is a difference

because the term "request" in the Speedy Trial Act occurs only
in connection with Section 3161(j)*s provision for the state
prisoner to request trial, and then the federal prosecutor to
request production,

whereas her® we ar© talking about; request

in Article IV(a), which is where the federal prosecutor
Initiate's the proceedings.

In the Speedy Trial Act there is

no comparable us® of the word "request" when the proceeding
is initiated by the federal prosecutors.
Q

But in either event, the word "request." in 'the

statute docs contemplate the issuances of the writ?
MR. FREY:

In the Speedy Trial Act the request can

b© satisfied by issuance of the writ.

But I think it. is

clear that the mere fact that in a slightly different, context
La another statute

the writ satisfies the requirement of a

request does not mean that the writ should be treated as a
request.

Under the detainer statute under Article IV where

the results are clearly results that were never intended by
Congress and that would have dir©~Q

If you say they were never intended by Congress,

how do you respond to Sectioi IV of the statute adopting the
Agraem-isnt on Detainers which describes the federal courts as
im appropriate court, which san only be in the context of -the
United States being a receiving state?

23
MR, FREY:

1 have two points to make about that.

The

first is that it is quite clear, if you look at what happened
was the Council on State Government circulated the proposed
draft ©f the agreement, and these additional sections after
the agreement ware mostly sections that were proposed by the
Council of State Governments with blanks, filling in the
blank.

And Congress, which I think clearly gave no thought

•so the question ©f what ‘the consequences ©f its adoption of
'the agreement, would be for the United States as; the receiving
state, simply filled in. the blanks.

And I think that actually

is what happened.
Q

Hut you would agree that those blanks would

only have to be filled in on the assumption that 'the United
States was the receiving state.
MR. FREY:
Q

Yes, but that of course is not—

Maybe it was a stupid thing to do, but at

least that is the only way it makes any sens© at all.
MR. FREY:

Yes, but it is not at all inconsistent

with my argument that the writ is not: a request because-—
Q

Oh, no, I understand that.

MR. FREY:
Q

All right.

It goes only to- your argument as to whether

iA© Federal Government ever thought that the United states
should over be a receiving state.
MR. FREY:

I do not deny that a close linguistic

analysis of a sentence or two in the legislative history end
of a provision like -the appropriate court provision shews that
those, things only have meaning if the United States is the
receiving state.

The question is whether you are compelled to

«jive that meaning in the face of the other considerations.
Q

What if w® were to rule in the Government's

favor on fch-a basis that it is a receiving state but none­
theless the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendam was left Intact.

The Government then wiuld have two alternative means of

going about procuring a prisoner.

We are rpiits willing to face that problem.

While there are on® or two scattered cases where there has
been som®. problem, it simply is not a practical problem.
States routinely in thousand 3 cf cases supply prisoners under

OPAL ARGUMENT OP DAVID J. GOTTLIEB, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

feh© Court:
I would like to begin with the Government's principal
submission, which is that tbs Federal Government participates
only ©s a sanding state in the Agreement on Detainers.
think that the language is clear.

I

This is more than a. case

where there is no disclaimer that the Government is s, receiving
state.

The language is explicit and unambiguous.
In addition to the language of Article II and

Article VIII, the agreement
offset.

applies with full force and

As Mr. Justice Stavans has noted, Section IV can

apply to the Government only in its capacity as a receiving
state.

Where the language is this clear, this Court has

previously held that resort to legislative history is not
«sven necessary.

But at the very least on a point this funda­

mental , the Government should be required, in order to over­
turn this clear language, to show some definitive expression
tihafc Congress did

not intend to d© what the language so

clearly says it did do.
The Government in Its brief points to four sources:
Tha legislative reports, the history preceding anactmant,
certain passages which they consider to be awkward, and the
subsequent passage of the Speedy Trial Act.

We would Ilk© to

2S
take each on® of those in tern.
Kith respect to the legislative reports# there is no
explicit statement in either of the reports limiting the
federal role.

In fact# as we noted in our brief, there are

specific references to support the view that federal participa­
tion in the agreement was net restricted.

The reports note

that the agreement was designed to apply with full fores and
effect..

When they discussed the agreement# there is no

restriction on federal participation.,

And the reports

include a letter from the Assistant, Commissioner, the District
of Columbia# which explicitly states that the agreement
provides a means for Justice Department attorneys to obtain
state prisoners.
Q

Why would the: Assistant Commissioner of 'the

District of Columbia have ary unusual authority to speak for
the Justice Department?
MR* GOTTLIEB:

.Your Honor# we do not contend, that

he was speaking with the authority of the Justice Department—
Q

Or of the Federal Government.

We do not claim that there was any

Limited, tlet th©r© would be soma indication that—some
attempt to disabuse the Assistant Commissioner of his
impression which accords so completely with the language of
th© statute.
It is true that most of the references in th©
report® refer to the Government's participation as th© sending
state.

But they are by no means exclusive.
A major part of tbs Government brief is devoted to

showing that the Government had no n^ad for the procedures in
Articles III and IV since since their use of th® writ, was
guaranteeing speedy trials without the problems caused in the
detainer system*

And the Gcvernmant claims that this fact

should he reflected In the agreement.

I think there ere two

problems with this argument.
First, th® picture is not entirely correct.

And,

.•second, there is absolutely no evidence that the view was
.y>ted in the legislation.
The; Government claimed that the writ was used to
prmr.id® prompt trials, and they contrast

this with the

28
procedure used by the stater..

Unexplained is -the frequent

us® of detainers by the Government since detainers ware filed
to hold rather than produce people.

In fad:, we believe the

record shows that speedy trials are not always provided prior
to the. agreement and that the writ was not always honored.
C

Is there some history that suggests that the

detainer procedure was used and n© final decision on prosecu­
tion had been reached, but that it was a sort of holding
operation until a decision cn an indictment had been arrived
at?
mr„

GOTTLIEBi

l co not believe that there is any

indication in the history that the Government's use of the
detainer was that restricted.
G

Not restricted, but

Some of the detainers are filed before

an indictment, are they not?
MR,. GOTTLIEB:

Yes, as

in this case.

I do not

believe, however, that the use of federal retainers was that
restricted, to only that reason.

And I do not. think that

there is any evidence—
Q

But it included that practice ? is that your

position?
MR. GOTTLIEB:
Q

I would certainly suppose so.

Mr. Gottlieb, did you say that sometimes the

writs wer-3 not honored?

There were attempts ky federal prosecutors to produce

two defendants in an Ohio prison—
Q

As I read it, it was not with a writ.

MR.. GOTTLIEB;

Your Honor - my recollection was that

they attempted to produce them by writ and that the Ohio
warden refused to produce them.
Q

He did not refuse.

MR. GOTTLIEB:

He just ducked.

In the Peres case, which involved the

Arkansas warden, the warden just simply explicitly stated that
It® was not going to honor the writ, and the Federal Government
iaad® no attempt to produce.
Q
.•jcr- ©body.

Somebody had setter leatre the Shipp case to.
That is a case wh-sre a sheriff in Florida was put

in jail.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

At any rate» Your Honor, the law at

the times th© agreement was p.issed in 1970 was certainly
unsettled as to th© power of th© Federal Government to compel
production.

As a matter of fact, there was no case that held

that federal power, the Federal Government, could compel
production under the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendam,whereas 'there are a slew of decisions stating that production

30

was only accomplished as a matter of comity.
C

Are you sayirg that compliance with with a

mandate of a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court

was

complied with only as a matter of comity?
MR, GOTTLIEB?
\

That is certainly the view of the

overwhelming number of cases that have expressed an opinion
an this issue.
Q

Mr. Gottlieb, you are only talking about the

writ of hafcaaa corpus ad prcsequendam.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Ad proseguendam when issued to

somebody incarcerated in state.
Q

Outside the territorial jurisdiction of the

issuing court?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Correct.

In fact, I would submit

that the proof that the Government was intended as the
rocsiving and sending state and their history is not quite
correct is that the Council of State Governments, when they
drafted this agreement, specifically intended and included
the Government as a receiving and sending state.

And in their

3ct3'F*>ntary on the- draft agreement there is specific language
that the agreement is designed to give a means for state
txri sonars to dispose of federal detainers and to help work out
•the situation involving the lodging of detainers, federal
detainers, against state prisoners.
Q

Mr. Gottlieb, do you contend that the

31
enactrr.arit cf the interstate Detainers Act, impliedly repealed
2241(c)(5) of the habeas corpus ad prosequendam section of the
Judicial Code?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

No, we do not, Your Honor.

And what

;ls more Important, the Court did not in the Ford case—
Q

Do you think tt said in the issuance of a writ

lias to be brought somehow within the Detainers Act as a
request?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

No.

Tha Ford case is very clear that

that is limited to the situation in which the Government has
actually lodged detainer and

has triggered -the deprivations

that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers was designed to
alleviate.
Q

But in the Ford case the Government did issue

i. writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendam.

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Yes

This would go to the question

cf whether the writ has to bn construed as a request.

But

the Ford car.© does not hold that the agreement is the exclusive
means of producing prisoners.
0,

But it necessarily holds that the Interstate

Detainers Act modified the previously unbridled jurisdiction
cf the federal courts to at; least issue the writ, whether or
not it would ba honored or net.
Ml. GOTTLIEB:
authority

I dc not believe that it modifies the

be issue the writ.

It construes the writ as a.

32
request.

Undar the agrearner;t, the Government is fre© to issue

the writ,
Q

But the writ of habear, corpus ad prosequendam

is nonetheless subject to ell the burdens that a request, under
the Detainers Act would.
MR,, GOTTLIEBs

That was an issue which in fact Judge

Mansfield did not exclusively reach.

Th® only exception in

■the Interstate Agreement on Detainers which can possibly be
construed as a partial repeal of the writ of hebeas corpus
ad prosequendam,, in our view, is the requirement of Article
IV[that there be *» 30-day waiting period and that the
governor be given power to dishonor.

The requirement that a

trial be held in 1.20 days whan a prisoner is produced is no
snore & repeal of the writ than th© provisions of th© Speedy
Trial Act,

.chafe somebody be tried in a certain period of time,

it is a consequence of the U mi ted States filing a detainer and
producing' a prisoner for trial.

Ife i-s not a repeal in any way

of th© writ.
Q

You simply sa/ that the act makes it mandatory,

cevoe when the prisoner is prsduced by writ of habeas corpus,
fehf~.fe he be -tried within 120 lays.
Q

And net be returned until he is to b® tried,

MR, GOTTLIEB?
freedom to waive that.

Yes, Your Honor, although there Id
And only in cases—it is very clear

from the Ford opinion that it is limited to -these cases in

33

which the detainer has actually basin lodged.

It Is not

restricted—I maan, it does not hold that it is; the exclusive
moans of producing someone.

If the Government chooses to

proceed without a detainer, they may very well be outside of
•■the Agreement on-Detainers, and that is the question which
the Court will be deciding in the next csss, in Mauro.

But

sh.i preponderance of the Circuit Court opinion on this issue
is that the Government has its choice? it can file the writ
«and produce the prisoner, or it can file © detainer and
subject itself to the terms of the Interstate Agreement on
Detainers.

And that is don® by 'the recognition of the

substantial burden that detainers cost and of the substantial
problems caised by detainers.
Q

Let me phrase it a little differently.

Certainly

your argument implicates a dramatic alteration of the effect

of the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendam.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Your Honor, that was the—the reach

of Art. tela IV ;a) was an issue that Judge Mansfield did not
determine.

The only exceptian of Article IV which implicates

the. power of a writ in any wry is Article IV (a) which w® concedi:
was written in and which the commentary in the Council of State
Governments states was written as a means of preserving the

existing right to extradition.

Our position is that the law,

at las at at the time the agreement w?.s enacted by Congress,
v&s very unclear as to whether or not there was a power to

34
refuse.

As e matter of fact, virtually all the authority said

■that the writ was honored only as a matter of comity.

There­

fore , to have put -that in Article IV {&) dees not, in our view,
limit what Congress thought *as the power of the writ at that
time.

Judge Mansfield—
Q

Did they not even make it more effective than

it was?
JO. GOTTLIEB:

It is ironic that the Government

complains about the limitation in the writ because prior to
.',.970 there were problems in terms of production of prisoners
when federal writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendam were
issued, and there is absolutely no evidence that there has
been a problem since the enactment of the Interstate Agreement
on Detainers.
Q

It seems to have worked very well.
Is not what the Government is saying though

that they were going to proceed by the Detainer Agreement
with its burdens and benefits as ons alternative.

But they

>

think that Congress intended that the habeas corpus ad
proseguendam be retained as written without being subjected to
like

Detainers Act, so that the Government really has two ways

to go, each of which presumably may have burdens for the
Government.
Mb. GOTTLIEB:

Our position is that a construction

f 'here sort, particularly in light of the evidence that the
Government in our view has been using the writ as a request

35

ander the agreement, the ns® of that would just simply write
'the Government out of Article IV of the agreement, anc! it
would create situations like the present cas® where there was
a detainer lodged for some two years where the Government
■produces a prisoner, took him out of state custody, where the
prisoner constantly complainad that he was being denied
furlough opportunities because of the pendency of the detainer,
where the delay deprived the prisoner of an opportunity to
serve more of his sentence concurrently—
Q

But. if the State of Massachusetts objects to

that and is served with a writ of habeas corpus ad prosscmandam,
it can presumably litigate this question that you say and I
gather moot everybody concades—it is certainly undecided in
this Court--whether it is mandatory or a matter of comity.
The Stats of Massachusetts could insist that they proceed
under the Detainers Act.
MR. GOTTLIEB;

That is undoubtedly correct.

But by

reading it that way, it wou 13. wipe the Government out of
ivrfeicla IV since the vast preponderance of their transfers
now are by writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendam.

It would be

a peculiar way, we submit, tP construe an agreement which

states in Article IX that it is to be liberally construed to
offactuate its purposes.
Q

Mr. Gottlieb, is it not entirely possible that

the Government might retain '-she alternatives of going under the

36

'

Agre&ment on Detainers Act o:: going by way of the habeas
corpus writ, but the choice would have to mean as to whether
liiey filed a detainer or not?

And if they filed no detainer

at all—and then of course this will be decided in the next
case—perhaps the Agreement on Detainers Act doss not apply,
said then they can go ahead with their habeas corpus alternative.

So, if the Government had not filed a detainer

MIL GOTTLIEB:

Your Honor, that is this question that

you are going to have to decide—
Q

MI... GOTTLIEB:

I think it can vary easily be con­

strued a* an alternative procedure.

And that happens to be the

resolution that the Fifth Circuit took in Scallion and -the
First Circuit indicated in Kenaan•>

I apolog? se if I seem to

ba dodging th© question.
Q

That issue is not in your case, but you had made

some statements about it.

And I just wanted to be clear.

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Yes, X think it is just absolutely

essential to remember that this case does not require

decimior-, or whether or not. the e.grssrnent is the exclusive
means of production for a prisoner in state custody.
We submit that in order to effectuate the purposes
of the agreement, it is absolutely necessary to construe the
writ in cases where a detainer has been filed as a request.
The agreement was designed to get at abuses of detainers, and
the Government has stated what those abuses are, although they
denied that prisoners with federal detainers were subject to
those abuses,
The agreement itself provides that the lodging of
a detainer triggers two seto of procedures with corresponding
rights and responsibilities.

One® a detainer has base lodged,

•the prisoner may request disposition.

Once a detainer has

been lodged, the prosecutor has the ability to secure the
prisoner.

In both cases trial must be prompt to avoid the

lingering effect of detainers.

As Judge Mansfield noted below,

the provisions of Article IV are mare than a quid pro quo for
production.

They are a counterpart to Article III to prevent

id!© prosecutor from circumventing that article by simply
arraigning the prisoner and waiting before trying him.

In

order to effectuate the purposes of Article III, it is
necessary to construe the writ as a request in those cases
where a detainer has bean filed because the effect of
detainers, which was the -reason for the adoption -of the
agreement in the first place,
