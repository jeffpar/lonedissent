L5.2.S.1.ERLE9.5,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Ho, 77-152, Beth Israel Hospital against National
Labor Relations Board»
Mr» Chandler, you may proceed whenever you are
ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT CHANDLER ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHANDLER:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case involves the validity of a no-solicitation„

no-distribution rule as it applies to a nonprofit hospital's
cafeteria which is used by patients, their families, and
employees.
The primary function of a hospital is to provide
patient care, and critical to that function is providing an
atmosphere as free from stress and strain as possible.

The

hospital's rule banning solicitation and distribution cf
literature which can be disruptive to the care of patients
in all patient and family access areas, including the cafeteria,
is clearly in furtherance of that concern.
Congress, in amending the National Labor Relations
Act of 1.974 to include coverage of nonprofit hospitals,
explicitly stated that hospitals are unique and expressed its
concern for the well-being of hospital patients and a need to
avoid disruption wherever possible.

This concern was

4
recognised by the D.C. Circuit Court, of Appeals in NLRB v.
Baylor cited in the brief and the Tenth Circuit Court and the
NLRB v. Sto John8 s Hospital also cited, both of which denied
enforcement of Board orders and upheld no-solicitation rules
in patient access areas of those hospitals.
The need and justification of Beth Israel's rule
is graphically demonstrated in this case where -.anion literature
was passed out in the cafeteriae viciously disparaging the
quality of health care provided by the hospital.
Let us consider the effect on an ambulatory patient
visiting with his family in the cafeteria.

He picks up a

union leaflet left on a table with statements such as the
following, and. I quote:
"They totally ignored me while I was a patient.
experience was bewildering, painful and ugly.
wasn't a complicated delivery.

My

I was lucky it

Don't ever have a baby here

unless you have a private doctor."
"Reports and films have become backed up,
can't get their films and reports on time.

Doctors

Patient care is

suffering."
QUESTION:

Who is speaking in this material you

are reading?
MR. CHANDLER:

This is union literature distributed

by employees in the cafeteria at Beth Israel Hospital in an
area where patients and their families can see them.

5
QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler, the coffee shop is closed

now, is it?
MR. CHANDLER%
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

Why was it closed?

MR. CHANDLER:

There was a renovation, and the

space of the cafeteria was expanded to include the coffee
shop area.

So

bow

-there is a greater seating capacity in the

cafeteria than when the case first arose.
QUESTION:

Was the coffee shop run by the hospital

per se or by some women's organisation, as so many do, or how?
MR. CHANDLER:

The coffee shop was also run by the

hospital personnel with employees„

There w$re vending machines

in this area and seating areas for patients and employees and
visitors of patients.
There are other remarks contained in the record
appendix in union propagandas

"Due to understaffing.” "Lab

specimens sit on countertops for hours, therefore results are
misleading or altogether wrong.” "Much of the hospital is not
maintained in a sanitary manner.”

"Respiratory treatments

ordered by doctors are not always performed."

"Patients who

need treatments to stay alive get them, but those who need
them -to get better don't, get them."

"The ratio of patients

to nurses presents a hazardous environment and precludes the
delivery of optimal health care.”
The record appendix is replete with such examples.

6
QUESTION;

Mr. Chandler, I don't claim to be an

expert on union organising tactics, but this does not strike
me as the ordinary union organising literature which would be
urging claims for added benefits or criticizing in some other
way than this.

Is 'there something in the record that suggests

why this sort of criticism was resorted to?
MR, CHANDLER;

Your Honor, the National Labor

Relations Board has recognised in numerous cases that union
solicitation — forget about scurrilous propaganda — but the
normal union solicitation as a part of an organizational
campaign is potentially disruptive, and in the retail store
industry, in restaurants, they find that this is enough to
warrant a broad ban on such activity, union solicitation and
distribution, wherever customers are present or likely to foe
present.
What the hospital is asserting is the same interest
that applied to an employer who operates a restaurant or a
retail store.

The patients who are sick and their families

who come into a hospital setting

and understandably anxious

and vulnerable, as the Board itself has recognised, should be
entitled to at least the same treatment as customers who come
into a retail store.
QUESTIONs

It's a matter of common sense.
Is one of the claims of the union,based

on what you read of their literature, that the hospital is
understaffed and that8s part of the union organizing that if

7
they get a union, they will see that it's properly staffed?
MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, your Honor.

The tenor of this

literature is geared towards complaints about working conditions,,
as most union campaigns are.
QUESTIONj

They don't always, in their organising

stage, emphasise so much the need for more employees as this
literature would appear to»
MR. CHANDLER:

Hot in other kinds of situations, but

hers we are dealing with a hospital, and they are raising
concerns that are concerns to patients, and here every hospital
has areas that are set aside for employees to engage in this
activity.

There are employee-only areas within the hospital,

and they may organise, they may distribute literature in
those areas without interfering with patients or their fan»-*IVr*..
So the hospital feels that in order to protect patients, to
insulate them from the potential disruption of this kind of
literature or any kind of disruptive literature, and especially
union literature because the Board itself has given its stamp
of approval to banning that kind of distribution because that
in and of itself is inherently disruptive according to the
Board, controversial remarks such as this.
QUESTIONS

Has the hospital allowed political

candidates to come in the restaurant and distribute literature?
MR,, CHANDLERs

Ho, they do not.

As a matter of

fact, the hospital rule was promulgated initially during the

8
Vietnam War to avoid demonstrations in the hospital throughout
.patient access areas .
Now, the rule has been amended since then a number
-of times»

However, the present rule involves a total ban on

solicitation and distribution in patient access areas.
QUESTIONt

Mr, Chandler, does the record tell us

how often -this material actually fell into the hands of
■patients or visitors?
MR. CHANDLERs

There is no evidence in the record,

your Honor, to indicate that it fell into patients' hands at
all.

However, the Board in its other case precedent recognizes

that leaflets may be left in customer access areas and may be
discarded and picked up by a customer.

And we feel there is

a logical, inference that that could happen in this setting
as wello
Rather than being sensitive to the unique conditions
found in a hospital and to the declared intent of Congress to
recognize the special needs of patients, tins Board has
mechanically applied rules that suit a factory environment
where no patients, customers,,, or third -parties are involved.
I have already alluded to the special circumstances
present in a hospital environment involving patient care
considerations.

Inherent in the nature of a hospital opera­

tion, the treatment of patients,, is the fact that patients are
understandably anxious and vulnerable and likely to be upset

3

by union solicitation and distribution in patient access areas«
The Board itself recognised this principle prior
to the 1974 amendments in the Guyan Valley Hospital case, which
is cited in the brief.
QUESTIONS

Mr» Chandler, dc you think it necessarily

follows that patients would be upset by a leaflet that said,
"Beth Israel employees get only so much an hour? Peter Bent
Brigham employees get 10 percent more"?

Do you think that

would upset a patient?
MR. CHANDLERs

I think, your Honor, there is a

question of degrees, and if the hospital were to allow some
union solicitation on a selective basis, it would create
problems of deciding which to allow and which not to allow.
In that particular case, I would think there could be a
problem from a patient's point of view, feeling that there is
some undercurrent within the hospital that employees are
dissatisfied with the hospital

and they may not be; able to

go about their duties properly.
As I was saying earlier, the Board in Guyan Valley
affirmed an administrative law judge's decision.

The

administrative law judge found that the hospital services
ill individuals who in their weakened condition, may readily be
upset if they overhear anti-union, pro-union arguments among
employees while they, the patients, are in their rooms or in
the halls or elevator©, and taking into consideration the

10
nature of the institution and the necessity for protesting
patients, any presumption of illegality la overcome.
QUESTIONs

Does this case involve patients* rooms?

MR. CHANDLER?
QUESTIONS

This case does not, your Honor.

I thought you said rooms.

MR. CHANDLERS

The Guyan Valley case that I am

citing now involved patient access areas.

This was a rule

that was in effect prior to the amendments.

The Board

recognised that a hospital creates a special circumstance,
and they allow, just like they did with retail stores, they
allowed an exception to the normal presumptions and said that
in patient access areas — and they defined them as the gift
shop, elevators, stairways, corridors, patient rooms, and
so forth.

This was in the administrative law judge's decision

affirmed, by the Board.

They recognised that solicitation could

be prohibited.
However, after the amendments were enacted in 1974,

\

a year and a half later, despite the fact that the Board
conceded before the Tenth Circuit in the St. John’s case
that Guyan Valley represented an accurate state of the law
at the time the amendments went into effect, a year and a half
Lator in. the St. John’s decision, the Board St. John8a decision,
the Board, without articulating any reason for departing from
the Guyah Valley analysis, without medical evidence, without
any medical expertia©, reversed its position.

And they ruled

11
that although special conditions exist in a hospital, that
although a tranquil atmosphere is essential to a hospital8s
primary function of providing patient care, said that although
solicitation might be upsetting, unsettling, to patients in
strictly patient care areas, that solicitation could have no
adverse effect on patients in other areas, such as cafeterias,
lounges, and fch© like»
QUESTIONS

Did the Board have jurisdiction over

Guvan Vallev because it was a for-profit hospital?
MB,. CHANDLER s

Yes.

The Guy an Valley was a for-

profit hospital and was. covered by the Act»

And Congress in

amending the Act to include nonprofit hospitals said -that at
least the same treatment should be afforded to employees and
hospitals as under the prior legislation»

And what has

happened here is the Congress added safeguards because of the
taking of jurisdiction over nonproprietary hospitals involving
specific amendments to statutes involving getting Federal
mediation involved earlier, strike notices, and so forth.
But they didst91 give recognition to the already existing
state of the law»

Congress realised that the same conditions

should apply, and they stated as much»

In the Congressional

Record there is ample support for the proposition that at least
the same rights for proprietary hospitals should continue in
effect plus additional safeguards»
QUESTION s

Are you suggesting that the Board has

12
the, wrong standard in these kinds of cases?

Or ar© yon just

challenging -die application of an accepted standard in -this
context?
MRo CHANDLER;

I am challenging the notion of not

applying at least the same standard that is applied in a
customer access area of a retail store to a. hospital setting
where patients are involved, and where Congress in amending the
Act to include nonprofit hospitals specifically stated.that
the Board in treating the situation should give special
attention to the needs of patients.

So it seems to be more

necessary to look at patients8 needs in a hospital environment
than to look at csstoners8 needs in a retail store»
QUESTION£

You are really then challenging the

application of a rule that has evolved to the hospital.
MR. CHANDLER:

That's correct.

I am challenging

this disparate treatment of the Board in a retail context and
a hospital context.

In a hospital context we have specific \

guidance from Congress that patients should be treated special.
QUESTION s

I suppose it depends on how high a

level of abstraction you want to reach in answering my brother
White’s question»

If you complain that the Board isn't

applying the same standard to hospitals as it is to retail
stores, you are in effect complaining about the standard the
Board has adopted, aren't you?
MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, your Honor, I would agree, with

13
that o
QUESTIONS

When you say '’retail/’ do you include

restaurants open to the public?
MR. CHANDLER:

Yes* 1 do* your Honor.

And this is

a case which involves the hospital cafeteria with a substantial
number of patients and visitors that use that cafeteria.

And

they are just as much customers of this cafeteria.
QUESTION:

Is it necessary for uniform application

that there be any patients or any family in the restaurant

if
In

other, words* if they can't go into the Rive Gauche and
distribute literature, is it your position they can't go into
any other restaurant just because it happens to be in a
hospital?

*
MR. CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.

Than it doesb.81 make any difference

whether patients are nervous or their families are nervous.
MR. CHANDLER: k That is a second position that the
hospital asserts* your Honor.

First wa feel that the ratail

store precedent should be applied in this case because
patients are involved.

A hospital is a special circumstance

in and of itself and that interest should be protected to
insulate patients from potentially disruptive influences.
Secondly* this is a cafeteria and cafeterias outside
of hospital settings have been given this kind of protection

14
against union solicitation,
QUESTION:

Generally in an ordinary cafeteria,

the employees of the cafeteria are not sitting around at the
tables, are they?
MR, CHANDLER;

They may sit around at tables.

QUESTIONs

Mr. Chandler, why don’t you give a very

simple answer to my brother Stewart that most employees that
handle -fell© food in the cafeteria know better than to eat there.
(Laughter.)
MR. CHANDLER:

I wish I had thought of that, your

Honor.

And that's why I
There are employees

at the hospital that work in the cafeteria.
Tha Board in St. John's
Guyan Valley

moved away from this

principle, and they said that only non-

ambulatory patients or

patients who are confined to their

rooms and to immediate care areas or treatment rooms are
entitled to the protection from union solicitation and
distribution, that other patients who are ambulatory are better
able to endure the unsettling effects which -tha Board
recognises might be the ease in the immediate patient care
areas„
Tha Board apparently has rendered its

expert

judgment that the unsettling effects of such solicitation end
distribution for soma reason are suspended while a psychiatric
patient, is in a cafeteria with his family awaiting psychiatric

18
treatment or a cancer operation.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Chandler? I have been trying to

figure out where do you recommend the solicitation should take
place?
MRo CHANDLER;

We recommend that the solicitation '

be allowed irs employee-only areas of the hospital.
QUESTIONS

Which are what?

MR. CHANDLERS

There are locker rooms and adjacent

rest rooms in the hospital? and outside of the hospital —
QUESTIONS

Outside the hospital?

MRo CHANDLER? Outside of the hospital —
QUESTION?

Front steps?

Isn’t there the scam© danger

on the front steps that maybe a leaflet will be handed to a
patient not knowing he is a patient?
MR. CHANDLERs

Yes? your Honor.

Outside the

hospital on public grounds that the hospital lias no control
over.
QUESTIONS

It could direct its employees not to

solicit out in front because it might have this same adverse
effect? couldn’t it?
MR. CHANDLER:

But the hospital has no control over

what may happen on public property.
QUESTION2
doesn’t it?

It has control over its employees,

Why couldn’t it: apply the same rule? say yon

will get fired because this may jeopardise the health of a

19
psychiatric patient, walking in the front door?

Wouldn't it

be precisely the sam® risk as in the coffee shop where one
percent of the people are patients, as I understand it, or
2 percent, something like that»
MR. CHANDLER:

I think there is less of a risk

involved because
QUESTION:

There is a risk.

MR. CHANDLER:

There is soma risk.

But there is

a balance that has to be made, your Honor.
QUESTION:

whereas in the coffee shop, of course,

they can at least ask the parson whether they are a patient or
not.

But 1 suppose out in front it may b® a little mors

difficult.

People are walking along, you sort of stick a

leaflet in front of then.
You just figure that risk is outweighed by the need
to organise in that particular context, is that right?
MR. CHANDLER:
your Honor.

I believe so in that context, yes,

In the cafeteria, no, because there ar® patients

who, regardless of whether they are able to walk to the
cafeteria, may be quite ill and ar© in need of protection and
insulation and in need of an environment to help them cope.
QUEST?”ON:

Every patient, I suppose, has to walk

in the front door, but every one doesn't eat in the cafeteria.
Most patients, I assume, get most of their meals in their
rooms

Most in-patients, your Honor.

MR. CHANDLER:

They

Their

rule there is a distinction between ambulatory end nonambulatory is not supported.
QUESTION:

What if the us© of the cafeteria was

only minimal by patients?

And I take it. here that it's not a

very high percentage of patients who use it, at least not a
very high percentage of the customers are patients.
MR. CHANDLER:

Thera are a substantial

number of

customers, however. Based upon, the figures that are in the
evidence on an annual basis, there are over 54,000 patients

21
and their families,» visitors, who use that cafeteria just to
purchase meals.

And in the decision of the administrative

law judge, which is appended to the brief of the petitioner
in a related case, he found that patients use

the cafeteria

for visiting and not necessarily to purchase meals.

So there

could be a substantially greater number than 54,000,
QUESTION?

Mr, Chandler, you keep saying that the

Board did not follow its own precedents.

Is that your

complete argument?
MR, CHANDLER?

No, your Honor,

I think that we

have here a situation where Congress has spoken.

Congress has

said that special attention must be given to the needs of
patients,

And our position ie that the Board has net recognised

the special needs, not only because of 'the retail store
exception, but because th© hospital is a special circumstance.
It's a unique environment and should bo given special attention.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr, Come,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME OH BEHALF
OF RESPONDENT
MR, COME %
Courts

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

I think that much of ray brother3s argument proceeds on

the assumption that when Congress enacted the Health Care
Amendments of 1374 and brought nonprofit hospitals under the
National Labor Relations Act, it somehow mandated the Board to

22
restrict solicitation and distribution by employees in an
organizational context.
w® submit that th® legislative history of that
statute, those amendments, shows quit® to th@ contrary that
Congress intended to leave it to the Board3,® discretion to
continue to exercise its pre-existing responsibility to
accommodate employ®® organisation®! rights and -the employer's
management interests, which in the ease of a hospital is to
maintain patient care.

QUESTION?

Do you challenge the findings that a

significant number of nonemployees use that cafeteria over a
r

period of a year?

MR. COME:

The findings of the Board, which were

sustained by the court, of appeals and which are based upon
a survey which the hospital conducted, that appear at record
appendix 124, shows that employees purchased 77 percent of the
*

meals served in this cafeteria, visitors 9 percent, and
/

patients only i.SS percent.

The remainder of the meals were

purchased by students, volunteers, doctors,, nurses, andvothers•
There is no employee-only facility in this hospital.

The

hospital’s employees’ handbook states, "A modern cafeteria is
provided for all employees whare nutritious, well-prepared
meals may be-purchased at reasonable prices.si

In short, the

point that 1 am making is that this hospital cafeteria -is
r-iiT

ily an employee eating facility.

Th© hospital held it

23
out to its employ®as as such.

And indeedr it has used the
l.

cafeteria area to communicate with employees concerning
hospital programs and has permitted employees to obtain

matters.

Red Cross, for example.

MR. COME:

well, the trial examiner,at petitioner’s

appendix 33, indicates the nature of them:

Posters publicising

the hospital’s "Buck a Day,” a cost reduction program? travel
brochure rack? car pool board? literature concerning nutritional,
ideas? commercial literature relating to

tennis camps, film

processing, magazine subscriptions? United Fund and Combined
V.-v-

Jewish Philanthropy’s drive, and things of that sort.
The point is, though, that where the hospital drew
the line was at solicitation and literature relating to union
activities.
QUESTION:

Mr. Corns, following up a little bit on

the Chief Justice’s question, the leaflets described by Mr,,
Chandler and his opening arguments with this case is to depend
on facts that are, and perhaps it shouldn’t, seem to present
the very worst possible situation for the union’s position and

24
the Board's position a good deal worse than X would think
normal organising tactics would present.

Is there anything

in the Board's records that suggests why the union resorted
to this type of statements in its organising campaign?
MR. COMEs

I submit* your Honor, that although some
»

of this literature perhaps get to the outer fringes, it still
protests working conditions and often union literature ©n that
subject is not exactly the language of the parlor,
The court of appeals found — I am reading from
petitioner's appendix 55 — “Beth Israel argues that, its nodistribution rule will prevent the union's"scurrilous attacks"
on -the hospital9 a health care from falling into the hands of
patients.

There was no evidence, however, that literature

offensive or otherwise was distributed to patients or visitors.
Employee Schunior testified that she took car© to distribute
only to employees.
QUESTIONS

Wall, the emphasis is on “distribute."

Doesn’t the record show that these were left on the tables and
available to anybody?
MR. COMEs

I think that all 'that the record shews

was what employ©© Schunior' distributed and what she was

As a matter of fact,

not even the hospital used the locker rooms or the bulletin

to communicate with the employees.

It either did so by posting

bulletins in the cafeteria or by giving them fliers in

the Courts

Continuing with the point that Mr. Cora© was making,

I think it is important to stress that tills case brings to
this Court a question concerning the validity of certain
basic rules9 presumption© that the Board has stated.

One of

those presumptions is that employee solicitation and distribu­
tion of union literature in non-working areas and during non-v
working times is

presumptively lawful.

Ites a presumption.

The hospital in any case can seek to overcome that presumption.
In this, case, the hospital did not seek to overcome
that presumption with any facts.

What it did was say that

I don't think the doctors would h©

So fch© question is

whether the 1.5 percent patients and 10 percent guests argue

ted I think that the Board

proceeded perfectly rationally in the following sense.
are two lines of cases as we have developed#

There

contrary to

the impression created by the petitioner that there is one.
Lin© 1 says that where you have an 'employee-only
cafeteria a restriction of this type is presumptively unlawful.
Presumption No. 2 says that where the facility is
primarily for the general public# such rules are presumptively
lawfulo
And what the Board did here was to any that to begin
this process as a working hypothesis, we will say that this
rule is presumptively unlawful and put the burden oa the
hospital which# after all# claims to have the medical
expertise to show that there are special circumstances which
make’ -the rale lawful.
The hospital didn’t mmp& that

Instead they argue that

heavy burden on them under this Court's general law regarding
the review of administrative agency determinations and that
they haven't begun to carry.

pat that way# is it?
MR. GOLDs

It isn't a substantial evidence problem

■

through th© end of 1193, th© administrative law judge considers
each of the factors which were argued, namely, the effect on
•sc

patients , the discrimination point that I would like to
stress, th© availability of access to people elsewhere.

He

reviews each aspect of the record and says -that in this
situation th® presumption was not overcome.
As to the discrimination point, which X guess will
be the only thing, if I can have even one minute on that.
We do want to male® the point t.hat the administrative law
judge found,the Board accepted the finding., and the court of
appeals affirmed it as well, that the employer put a greater
restraint on communications concerning union activity than
on ahy other type of communication•

from.th© Act itself, which protect© discussion of union

39
activity aM other matters concerning mutual aid and protection,
but doesn’t protect charity driv&s or discussions of sporting
events or public affairs, is in itself sufficient to sustain
the finding her®.

This is not a normal cafeteria, it is not

like Rive Gauche..

I would point the Court to the picturas

at pages 111 through 114.
QUESTIONS

But, Mr. Gold, if we should agree with

you, how do we explain away the retail store?
MR. GOLDs

This was my point, Mr. Justice Marshall,

in the retail store the basic function of the cafeteria of the
store is to serve the general public.

Here the basic function

of this cafeteria was to serve the employees.

You wouldn’t

walk into a general public facility and find slogans addressed
to the employees.

BAD means "Save a buck a day.1"

You wouldn't

find bulletin boards, tables set up for the employees.

The

employer"s actions here demonstrate that this was basically
a place used by employees and other staff and was the place
at which employees spoke to each other.

After all, union

solicitation and distribution sound like archaic terms, but
what they are is people talking to each other, people reading
literature, exchanging literature.
QUESTIONS

But. they can do that in the locker rooms.

MR. GOLDs

Well, as Me. Come endeavored to indicate,

Mr. Chief Justice, only a third cf the locker rooms are open
to employees generally.

The other locker rooms are open only

40
to the employees who have a locker in that particular facility.
And what the employer's rule does in this .instance is to close
off communication between somewhere around two-thirds of the
employees. Because what he wants to do is say that any place
you ever find a patient it5 s improper for employees to be
discussing unionization

,

whether or not they are working»

MR. CHANDLER;

Thank you.

There are several points in reply.
The record appendix verifies that there are
approximately 700 lockers in just four locker areas to which
all of Beth Israel employees have access.
Secondly, brother counsel stated that the Board's
rule is that a rule prohibiting solicitation during work time
is presumptively valid.

What he neglected to say was that

41
the Board rule also says it is presumptively valid to
prohibit solicitation in work areas and public or customer
access areas.

And her® the Beth Israel cafeteria, apart from

being a place \
access area.

employees are working, is a customer,

The customers here happen to be patients and

their families.

At the very least the hospital is entitled

to the same consideration.
The question of numbers bar been raised.

The Board

*

has never raised the question of how many customers are in a
particular area, in an elevator of a department store or in a
cafeteria in a department store.

We see no reason to apply it

in a cafeteria setting, especially here where there arc
substantial numbers.
The primary functions that brother counsel mentioned
that apply in a retail store, I cite again the Goldblatt case
because in that case the primary function was selling
merchandise.

The cafeteria in that case was-not for selling

merchandise? it was for selling food, an adjunct to that opera­
tion .
In the remand that brother counsel referred to in
the related Beth Israel ease, the administrative law judge made
certain findings of fact, and I would read from the addendum
in the briefs

"Solicitation and distribution

QUESTIONS

What page?

MR. CHANDLER;

This is on page 49.

42
"Solicitation and distribution in patient access
areas can interfere with patient care functions.

Such

activity can be disturbing to patients and their familiest
persons who are particularly susceptible to being disturbed»
Such disturbance can interfere with Beth Israel's primary
function of curing illness»"
However, he goes on to say that ha was bound by the
Board's rule in St. John’s,not by the Tenth Circuit court,
which reversed the Board's rule»
Curiously, the Board in the McDonald33 Hamburger
case applied the restaurant rule by saying, and I quote from
the decision of the Boards

"Union solicitation can lead to

heated verbal exchanges among solicitors and those solicited»
Indeed, it is certainly not unknown for violent physical
exchanges to occur in such circumstances.

Should such there

be in the presence of customers, as would not be unlikely, the
employer could well perceive the destruction of the rapport
which this employer and any. normal employer would like to have
with its customers.ts

You don't have

But the

Board has recognised in a retail store setting, in a restaurant
setting, that solicitation can be disruptive.

place, we would expect to be able to apply that same logic to
a hospital setting.

lawyer, you complain about the NLRB being consistent, and there

is express congressional intent to give the needs of the
patients special attention, that this would be the case where

where the Court should strike them down, as did the Tenth
Circuit and the D.C. Circuit Court

QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler, may I ask you one question?

44
MR* CHANDLERS
QUESTION;

Yes.

Was the rule against solicitation applied

to all solicitation or just to union solicitation?
MR* CHANDLERs

The rule was applied to controversial

solicitation, your Honor*
QUESTIONS

How was that defined?

MR* CHANDLER?
QUESTION?

Pardon me?

Hew was that defined?

MR. CEANDLERs

As I indicated earlier, the rule

originated when certain political activity was occurring in
the hospital involving Vietnam War and demonstrations *
was one reason for banning that kind of activity.

That

The hospital,

talking about medical people who make a determination as to
what may be detrimental to patients in a hospital setting, made
a determination consistent with the Board's own case law that
union solicitation is potentially disruptive *

They have

indicated to doctors, the hospital has indicated to its staff
not to discuss concerns in patient access areas that could
p

affect patients.

And this is a consistent concern.

The Baylor

court and the D.C. Circuit has recognised that this is
controversial material that should b© banned as opposed to
innocuous things.

And unless the Board shows that the

hospital's administration has made a bad medical judgment, then
we see no basis for the Board to insist upon a new rule.
As this Court determined recently in the University

i

45
of Missouri case against Horowitz , that involved the academic
field, but there they recognized that academic people are
1-etter able to make determinations as to academic problems
and subject matter than the courts or administrative agencies„
Here we would suggest that the same principle applies in the
medical field, especially where there was no medical evidence
or medical testimony other than the Board's own medical
perceptions that support its distinction for ambulatory as
against non-ambulatory.
QUESTION :

Did you submit any evidence about it?

MR. CEANDLERs

Your Honor, at the time the hearing

arose, the Board's case precedent was established, as I
indicated earlier.

It was the Guyan Valley precedent.

We

presented evidence that patients and visitors were present
and that solicitation activity occurred.
QUESTION:

But this medical judgment'that you think

ought to left to doctors, we have nothing in the record about
it.
MR. CHANDLERS

I don't believe you need fco pass on

that, your Honor, because of the mere presence of the customers
in a patient access area just as in the retail store.

This

presents a special circumstance.
