MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

The Court will hear argu­

ments first this morning in 76~H50„ Baldwin against the Fish
and G-ame Commission of Montana.
Mr. Goetz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. GOETZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOETZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
My name is James H. Goetz.
Montana.

I am from Bozeman,

I represent the appellant.
This case presents a challenge on constitutional

grounds to the statutory system of the State of Montana by
which big game licenses are made available to hunters who are
not residents of Montana.
The Montana statutory scheme is challenged on the
basis of two provisions of the United States Constitution,
Article IV, Section 2, the interstate privileges and immuni­
ties clause, and Amendment 14, the equal protection clause of
that Amendment.
The statutory system challenged is challenged in two
parts:

The first is, the challenge goes to the severe license

fee differential implicit in the Montana statutory scheme,
that is the differential between resident and non-resident big
game hunters.

The second challenge goes to the requirement

that the non-resident in order* to hunt in Montana roust buy
what is called a combination license* and that combination
license* I believe* is described adequately in the appellant's
opening brief»
QUESTIONS
from the first?

Well* is that latter really any different

All that is required is to pay some money* is

it net?
MR. GOETZs

All that is required is to pay some

money to get the combination license.

I think it presents —

excuse me.
QUESTION:

But* it is just* you can get it if you

just pay some money?
MR. GOETZ:

Well* yes* that is true,,

In that sense

it is the same* and in that sense:; our position, appellant5 s
position is that it is a means of indirectly gouging* if you
will* the non-resident hunter to increase the fees.

However**

in the constitutional sense it is different because the State
chose to defend the combination license for reasons unrelated
to ti e monetary7 or cost justification.

So I think it presents

a different issue in that regard.
QUESTION:

Do you analogize this to an illegal tie-

in sele?
MR. GOETZ:

Yes* I think I wouM.

I have not thought

about it in that context* frankly* but I think it would be
something like an illegal tie-in in the sense that it entails

5

an indirect imposition which must be undertaken by a person in
order to avail themself of the right to hunt.

1 think in that

sense it is much like an anti-trust tie-in, if I understand
your question correctly.
QUESTIONS

Did the district court address the combi­

nation license issue?
MR. G0ET3s
not.

In my judgment, the district court did

There is one footnote in the district court's opinion

which, suggests that the district court addressed that iso^c
simply as another aspect of the increase in fees, somewhat
alone the lines of Justice White's question here today.
It is clear they did not address, the district court
did rot address it directly.
QUESTIONS
MR. GOETZ;

Do you think it is before us?
Well, yes, I do, because it was presented

in the district court and the district court rejected the
plaintiff's and appellant's challenge to the combination
license, and there is absolutely no doubt in the record that
that issue was presented squarely and specifically, and as I
say, it was referenced in the footnote.

The district court

did not address it, at least as I thought they should have, as
a separate issue.
Now, the position of the appellants on the constitu­
tione.1 issue is that the combination license is simply uncon­
stitutional under both provisions presented.

6

'

With respect to the fee differential, the severe fee
differential, it is the position of appellants that that as
applied in Montana is unconstitutional, but that the case
Toomer against Witsell and the companion case from Alaska,
Mullaney against Anderson, leave room on the fee differential
for some additional assessment for non-residents if that
assessment is reasonably related to one of two factors, or
both.
Those factors are if the Stata residents contribute
taxes- which go to the resource or to conservation which the
non-resident does net, then to that extent the non-resident can
be assessed a higher fee.
The second aspect of the Toomer and Mullaney standard,
is that if the non-resident imposes soma additional enforcement,
burden, then to that extent the non-resident can be assessed an
addit.ional fee by the State.
QUESTION s

Do I understand you to agree with those

propesitions?
MR. GOETZs
QUESTIONs

Yes, I certainly do, Your Honor,
Both Toomer and Mullaney involved commer­

cial enterprises, the kind of calling or making a living thing
that I think Bushed Washington first referred to in Coryell
agair.st Corfield.

Eo you think those automatically carry over

to big game hunting, which certainly is not a way of making a
living, at least for the people who come in and hunt.

7
MRo GOET^s

Your Honor, I do not think that they

automatically carry overo

That is, I do appreciate a difference!

between recreation and the pursuit of a common calling.

How­

ever, it is appellants' position here that when logically
analysed and with due regard to the precedent in the area,
that indeed Toomer and Mullaney do apply to the present situa­
tion.
If I may expand on that, I would say that there is
some question about how far the privileged immunities clause
goes or to what it applies, and I have looked at the two most
recent «**- or two of the most recent pronouncements by this
Court, the most recent being Austin against New Hampshire, and
there the case did not, in my judgment, address very specifi­
cally the question of what is the nature of the right? rather
the cpinion of the Court went to the purposes of the privilege,
the interstate privilege and immunity clause, namely to promote
comity among the States, and that issue is certainly and that
purpose is certainly brought to bear in the present case.
QUESTION:

Do you think that loomed large in the

minds of the framers of the Constitution, the right of people
in ore State to hunt elk in another State?
MR. GOETZs

No, I do not.

I think it was probably

not significant question at that time, because -QUESTIONs
MR. GOETZ:

There were no elk in the East, I think,
I do not think there were any elk in the

s
East, but in any

at any rate, the premium on recreation was

not nearly so great at that time for obvious reasons, plus I
suspect but I do not know,

I suspect that hunting and fishing
\

were not licensed at all.
QUESTION3

Mr. Goetz, how many States have laws like'

this?
MR. GGET55 s

Well, the appendix of the appellee sets

forth a list of the States.

In the first place, with respect

to the combination license requirement, I think no State other
than Montana has it.
QUESTIONS
MR. GOETZ:

Well, that is what I am talking about.
Yes, the combination license,

I do not,

I am not aware of ary State that has that.
QUESTION:
MR. GOETZ:

So all we are dealing with is Montana?
Insofar as the combination license is

involved, that is right.
QUESTION:
Montana?

Well, how many licenses are applied for in

I mean, hew many people are involved in this?
MR. GOETZ:

Well, in the last year for which figures

are available, there were approximately 31,003 non-resident
hunters.

However •-»

QUESTION:
MR. GOETZ:

Elk hunters?
No, no.

Elk hunters were substantially

fewer, somewhere in the neighborhood of -- I would have to
consult Defendant's Exhibit A, but somewhere in the neighbor­
hood of 14,000»
And incidentally, there is a statutory limit for non­
resident combination licenses now in the Montana statutes, to
which I have reference in ir.y brief.
That figure is 17,000,

That figure has not been ap­

proached
QUESTION:
MR. GOETZ:
QUESTION:

How many elk do you have in Montana?
Well, I3m not sure —
If yoxx’ve got 14,000 shooting at them,

how many do you have left?
MR. GOETZ:

Well, we have got substantial numbers of

elk in Montana and the elk is quite wiley, and all elk are not
shot,.

In other words, not all hunters get elk.

14,0.C0 non-residents.

Those are

Of course, the number of residents is

much greater than that, so we have substantial number of elk
hunters.
QUESTION:

Well then, I conclude there are a whole

lot of bad shots out there.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOETZ:
shoot them.

Well, they have to see them first to

QUESTION s

Mr. Goetz, how long have these disparities

been in effect in your State?
MR. GOETZ%

I am not sure.

stantial period of time.

It has been quite a sub­

The precise fee has changed, of

course, with time, the most recent being in 1975.
QUESTION:

But this is the first challenge you know7

of?
MR. GOETZS

Tc the fee structure it is.

There was a

requirement in Montana that non-residents be accompanied by
residents and outfitters when hunting, and that was found un­
constitutional by the Montana Supreme Court on equal protection
grounds in 1975.

But tc the fee structure, to my kncwledge thi

is the first Montane case.
Now, there is a New Mexico Federal case which I have
referenced in my reply brief that was decided in August of
this year.
QUESTION:

Now, there are aspects of your statutory

structure where no distinction is drawn between resident and
non-resident, is that not so?
MRc GOETZ:
QUESTION:
MR, GOETZ:
QUESTION:
MR. GOETZ:
QUESTION:

Well —
Bow and arrow shooting?
Yes, I believe that is true.
And wild turkeys?
Yes.
Do you know why no different treatment

11
there?
MR. GOETZ;

No, I do not, frankly.

QUESTION:

Maybe the mortality rate of elk is not

very high with bows and arrows , is that it?
MR. GOETZ;

Well, it is rather rare that an elk would

be taken by a bow and arrow, and I do know from my own ex­
perience, it is not in the record, but turkey is not a very
prevalent game bird in Montana, and it may be that it is just
not thought to be a very important issue.
If I may —
QUESTIONs

You say, before you proceed, that the

total number of non-resident elk hunters is limited to a
figure of 17,000?
MR. GOETZ:
QUESTION3

Yes.
And what, they are drawn by, or would be

drawr by lot if there were more than that many applicants?
MR. GOETZ:

I believe that is the, as I read, the

statute, it is not clear how they do that and it may be that
the State Fish and Game Commission has to implement that by
regulation.

My understanding is that it is on a first-come,

first-served basis.
and then some lot.

It would either be that or a deadline
But they have not reached that figure, so

that —
QUESTION:
it?

It has never been necessary to determine

12

MRo GOETZ:

No, and that has not been challenged, of

course, in this lawsuit.
QUESTION:

I might say, Incidentally —

Do you think it would be challenged under

your line of reasoning if anybody who resided in Montana was
able to get an elk license but there x^as a flat ceiling on the
number of out-of-staters who

could get it, but no license fee

differential?
MR. GOETZ:

I believe that under my line of reckon­

ing that would be equally — that would probably be faulty.

I

must confess that, since that is not in the case, I may not.
have thought through it as carefully as I have the issues here,
but it is my position that that probably would be constitution­
ally faulty also.
QUESTION°

And a fortiori if Montana should say that

there shall be no non-resident hunters, only hunters shall
hunt elk?
MR. GOETZ:

Absolutely.

I believe that would be

flat!y unconstitutional„
QUESTION:

Mr. Goetc, in my home state there is a

provision that senior citizens, like most of us up here, over
the ave of ”X'S years, can get a fishing license without charge
at all, but they have to get a license.

Under your line of

reasoning, would that be unconstitutional?
QUESTION; De minimis significance, they never catch
a fish.

13

QUESTION?

Yes, hut they are the ones who are always

out fishing *
MR. GOETZ;

I think that is an excellent answer, and

I would like to expand on that.
QUESTION;

If that is what your case amounts to, you

had better get more than that, I think.
MR. GOETZ:

No, I think the case presents a much more

significant issue or I wouldn’t be here.

But in order to

respond to your question, I believe that —* well, if we look at
the senior citizen classification under the Equal Protection
Clause, as this Court did in Murgia, Massachusetts Board of
Retirement v. Murgia, it was decided to review that on a
minimal scrutiny basis, and if the state has reasonable grounds
for that approach, then that would pass constitutional muster.
The difference between that —* and I would be willing
in the Minnesota case to — that is where you are from, isn't
it, that is the state you are talking about — I would bo
willing to accept the constitutionality of that kind of dis­
crimination ,
If we carry that over to the present case, I think we
have an explicit holding by the District Court that the dis­
crimination is not justifiable on any cost basis, and I inter­
pret that to be there are no rational grounds under the Equal
Protection Clause unless you go to what the District Court
went to, and that is the political justification, and therein

14
I think, lisa one of the differences between your situation and
the Montana situation»

And my feeling is that t<re have a

unanimous finding by the District Court that, except for the
political justification, this non-resident fee differential
cannot be justified in Montana.
QUESTIONS

That is not the factual finding, that is

a conclusion of law, is it not?
MR. GOETZ:
this senses

No, I think that is a factual finding in

Facts were taken by the District Court, testimony

was taken, the District Court looked at that testimony, looked
at the rationalization offered by the state and then said, in
looking at the evidence, this can’t be justified, even giving
due regard to the presumption of constitutionality.
QUESTION:

But the question of whether a statute may

be justified under a particular set of facts or under a con­
ceivable set of facts
MR. GOETZ:

is itself a question of law, isn't it?
Oh, I agree' from that perspective, there

has to be a legal rubric within which to fit the facts, and
that legal rubric in the District Court was this:

The

appellants were arguing that the Toomer v. Witsell standard
is applicable, that is to the extent that higher enforcement
costs or conservation resident taxes were not paid or higher
enforcement costs were imposed on non-residents, so conserva­
tion taxes were not paid, there could be a higher non-resident
fee, and that is a legal rubric within which the court found,

15
xn my judgment, that factually the state's cost justification
didn't fit into that.

I guess I would classify that as a*

mixed law-factual question.
QUESTION;

Could you tell me or is it in the recoird

what percentage of the elk that, are taken are taken on federal
land?
MR. GOETZ;

Seventy-fi ve percent of the elk taken in

Montana are taken on federal land.
QUESTION;

I take it, although the United States

leaves that sort of thing to the states

under our cases, if

Congress were so incline!, I suppose it could limit or regulate
the taking of elk on federal land?
MR. GOETZ;

In my judgment, under the property cleiuse,

constitutionally Congress could on the federal lands have a
federal license.

And I night add to that, one of the worries

posed on I think both siles implicitly in this case, frcra a
state’s rights standpoint, is a federal license.

My feeling is

that —
QUESTION;

Mayoe not a federal license but a limit on

what the states could charge?
MR. GOETZ;

Right, either one, what Montana might

call federal intervention.

My feeling is that if appellant's

position were accepted here, that if reasonable constitutional
limitations were placed on the states, it would pose less
threat in terms of outsile, what is perceived to be outside or

16
federal influence with the game in Montana.
QUESTIONS

Do you think Congress would preempt this

area with exclusive license or would they have to do it con­
currently with the states-, as with the duck stamp on a state
license?
MR. GOETZ s

I'm not sure what they would have to do.

In terms of hunting on the federal lands, I guess my feeling is
that Congress could preempt the area if it wanted to.

Insofar

as gaming, of course, on non-federal lands, I'm not sure if
Congress has any interest in doing that.

So I think I would

separate the two, in that sense.
QUESTION:

Mr» Goets, the cost problem, cost

justification issue, is that relevant to both your equal pro­
tecti.on claim and your privileges immunity claim, or does it
have different constitutional significance?
MR. GOETZ:

It’s relevant

and important under both.

However, there may he different standards of judicial review
under the Equal Protection Clause as opposed to privileges
immunity.
QUESTION:

Is there any difference in the standard

of what the state according to your theory must prove in order
to ccst justify the licensing -MR. GOETZ:

No.

According to our theory, that

standard would be the same and we take that standard, of
course, from Toomer v. Witssll, and there is no — well, I was

17
going to say, to my knowledge, there is no equal protection
case that imposes that same standard.

However,» it should be

recognized that Takahashi v. Pish & Game Commission of
California was decided at the same time as Toomer and is an
equal protection clause, and I think juxtaposing those two cases,
given their similarities and the time proximity, that really
probably Toomer v. Witsell standasrd applies also under the equal
protection standard.
I have reserved ten minutes for rebuttal, so I will
conclude at zhis time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Goetz.

Mr, Lenzini.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. LENZINI,, ESQ.,
OR BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LENZINI:
the Courts

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Appellants challenge two separate features of

Montana's statutory big game licensing scheme.? first, the
combination license, and, second, the higher fees imposed upon
non-reisifients.

Montana is, however, by no means unique among

the states in charging higher fees for hunting by non-residents,
indeed, virtually every state does charge higher fees.
The resolution of the constitutional issue here re­
quires; analysis of the asserted right as well as the regulatory
interest of the State of Montana in regulating big game species.
Appellants claim that this case is covered by Toomer

13
v. Witsell and that the P&I clause of the Constitution requires
that non-residents should be treated on terms of substantial
equality with residents.
Neither the appelants nor the dissenting judge below,
however, assert that recreational hunting is a fundamental
privilege and immunity arid, indeed, no case has ever held.
Rather, appellants argue that extraneous features involved here
call into play the protections of the Privileges and Immunities
Clause.', namely the fact that 75 percent of the elk are taken on
federally owned land and the fact that the state receives
financial assistance from the federal government for wildlife
restoration programs.
The appellee submits that this analysis, without any
support in the judicial history of the P&I clause, and indeed
from the earliest interpretation in Corfield v, Coryell,

The

courts have consistently focused on the nature of the right
itself.
The clause has never been considered to guarantee to
non-rfisidents equality ir: all rights and privileges and the
fundamental right analysis has been consistently followed.
Neither may the appellants transform somehow this
recrea.tional activity into an activity covered by the Privileges
Clause, simply because of federal land being involved.

Congress

has declared that, or. the. national forests and Indeed much of
the land in Western Montana, where the elk is taken, is national

19

forest, and has declared in 16 USC, section 4(e) that jurisdic­
tion over the national forest resides in the state, both civil
and criminal;; and indeed in the Multiple-Use Sustained Yiel
Act of 1960, affecting the national forests, 16 USC 528, Congress
specifically declared that nothing therein shall be construed as
affecting the jurisdiction or responsibility of the several
states.
QUESTIONS

Would it be your position then that Montana

could if it wanted to exclude non-residents entirely from
recreational hunting
MRc LENZINIs
QUESTIONS

Mr. Justice White —

— I mean insofar as the Privileges and

Immunities Clause is concerned?
MRc. LENZINIs

Insofar as the Privileges and Immunities

Clause is concerned, I believe .it could.

With respect to the

Equal Protection Clause, ae have a different situation completely.
QUESTION:

I was thinking with the parks.

MR. LENZINIs
QUESTIONs

With the national parks?

Yes.

MR. LENZINIs

Bf law, there is no hunting permitted

at all in the national, packs.
QUESTION:

Sow about state parks, reserving state

parks for the use of citizens?
MR, LENZINIs

I submit that under the Privileges

Clause the court could, because the fundamental right is not

20
involved»

I think we have a different question under the Equal

Protection Clause.

There I believe that, unlike this case,

where we have a substantial number of non-residents coming into
Montana, there I think the question would probably require a
higher level of scrutiny by this Court»
QU33STION;

Well, let’s just say that —’ why is that?

Let's just say the state says that for political purposes,
mainly to encourage our citizens to be willing to put up the
money for state parks, we are just going to exclude non­
residents.

It says recreation, all they want to do is to camp

and walk around —
MR. LENZINI:

If the state scheme absolutely deters

all in-coming non-residents, I think we have a different situ­

ation than this case.
QUESTION;

Well, do you or don’t you think that that

would be reached by the Privileges and Immunities Clause?
MR, LENZINI;

3 do not think that it would be reached

by the P&I clause —
QUESTION;

And the Equal Protection —

MR. LENZINI:
QUESTION;

- - because I don’t think that —

Wher you say equal protection, you would

say you would need mere than a. rational basis for it?
MR. LENZINI;

That is not this case, of course, but

I think we -would have.- to look at different reasons for the state,
that :.s what is rational in that situation might be different

21

than simply —QUESTION:

But the interest remains the same, the

interest of non-residents.
MR. LENZINI:
QUESTION:

The interest remains the same»

And do you say that under the Equal Protec­

tion Clause, you would say the interest is entitled to more
weight?
MR„ LENZINI:

I think that under the Equal Protection

Clause:, where there is -- if federal lands are involved, for
example, I think that there might well be a different measure
of the state’s conservation activity than in the situation here.
QUESTION:

The point is that under the Privileges and

Immunities Clause, that that clause is simply inapplicable be­
cause this right is the right —
MRo LENZINI:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

-- to hunt recreationally is not covered

by that clause?
MR,, LENZINI:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

But now in contrast, the Equal Protection

Clause is applicable because it need not be any kind of a right
for equal protection analysis, isn't that it?
MR. LENZINI:

Wall, under the Equal Protection Clause,

implicit or explicit constitutional rights —
QUESTION:
classification.

The Equal Protection Clause has to do with

22

MRo LENZINIs

That’s correct»

And where the classifi­

cation is not invidious as here# but where the result is the
total exclusion# I could see the Court applying a different
level of reasoning perhaps# not necessarily strict scrutiny ~
QUESTIONS

Because in your mind of the interests so-

called involved?
MR,, LENZINIs

Because; of the result, I think# Your

Honor»
QUESTIONS

I must say, I just don't follow the reason­

ing, tecause the classification in either case — we are talking
about equal protection now# let's forget about privileges and
immunity — the classification between residents and non­
residents, you say that is a legitimate classification.

If it

is a }egitimate classification, why cannot they say no non­
residents at all?

Here you have said no non-resident who can’t

afford $240 or whatever it is»

What is the difference in equal

protection?
MR«. LENZINI;
non-residents at all»

1 think conceivably a state could say no
It would depend upon the rational of the

state# what it was trying to do.

I think if we had# for ex­

ample# a situation where we had a rare trophy species and only a
limited number could be hunted# I believe that the state could
readily say and demonstrate the need and the rationality.
QUESTIONs

Well# in all of these cases# as Justice

White points out# we don’t want too many people over-using our

23
park facilities and we would rather save them for the taxpayers
who pay for them, and we will simply exclude everybody else.
What is wrong with that?
MR. LENZINI:

I simply believe that it is not a funda­

mental right,, and I believe that the classification is not in­
vidious.
QUESTION:

Toomer v. Witsell is what is wrong with

that, isn't that correct?
MR. LENZINI:
case.

Well,, Toomer v. Witsell is a P&I Clause

In Toomer v. Witsell —
QUESTION:

Ism talking about equal protection.

That

was a racial classification, wasn't it?
MR* LENZINI:
QUESTION:

That's correct»

As I recall, in trying years, South Dakota

has limited pheasant hunting to residents on occasion.
MR, LENZINI:

That’s correct.

That case came to the

Supreme Court and appeal was dismissed because of lack of a
substantial federal question.
With respect to the question of federal aid, the
Federal Aid and Wildlife Restoration Act provides an 11 percent
excise tax on certain sporting arms and ammunition and apportion
that money back to the states for wildlife restoration programs.
Montana is a beneficiary of that.

But there is nothing in the

statute, the Pitman-Robinson Act, which in any way restricts
the state in connection with non-resident/resident differentials

24
And thus the appellee submits that the P&I Clause cannot be
transformed to cover this activity simply because of the
presence of federal land or because of the fact that Congress
has provided for federal assistance.

Congress knows how to

establish limitations? and it has done so in connection with
military personnel on military reservations.

Those lands are

generally lands over which the federal government has exclusive
legislative jurisdiction.

But even there? Congress has said

state fishing licenses shall be required? but that if personnel
who are on duty for more than thirty days? they need not have a
state license if the stata doss not provide licenses on terms
as favorable as those for residents.
establish conditions.

So Congress knows how to

It simply hasnst done so.

The» question here also involves the nature of the
state right over wildlife.

In Toomer v. Witsell? the Court

stated that it was long ago decided that one of the privileges
which the clause? the Privileges and Immunities Clause,
guarantees is that of doing business in State B on terms of
substantial equality with citizens of that state.

But plainly,

Toomer dealt with commercial shrimping, doing business, and
does not govern the instant case.

Both the majority below and

the dissenting judge found that the case involved recreational
hunting and the majority states that elk is not now and never
will bcs hunted commercially.
Turning to the Signal Protection Clause? the court

25
below found -that the Montana scheme bears a rational relation­
ship to a legitimate state purpose.

It held that it was a

finite local resource*, not everybody could hunt it, and there­
fore some restriction had to be made on hunter days»

The

District Court did not choose between the oxmarship doctrine
and the police power doctrine.
The nature of the state's power to conserve wildlife
has involved some semantic difficulties.

We have had the

ownership doctrine versus the police power doctrine»

In a 1935

decision of this Court, Hayside Fish Flour Co. v. Gentry, 297
U.S., the Court, through Mr. Justice Sutherland, declared that
over wild game generally the state has supreme control.

But in

Toomer v. Witsell, the Court said, well, the ownership was
simply a legal fiction, hut it was a legal fiction which was
expressly legal shorthand of the importance to its people that
a state has power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of
an important resource«
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish — how would you

distinguish between the state's interest in wild game as a re­
source , to use that, term, and subsurface minerals and energy?
MR. LENZINI:
ownership.

Owned by the state as opposed to private

In the mineral situation, the state has technical

ownership, as it would over the state capital, the state capital
building.

But in connection with

fish and wildlife, I think

the state has a qualified ownership.

It does not have technical

26

ownership.

As Mr. Justice —
QUESTION:

Is there a difference partly because the

minerals can;t migrate but the game can?

Would that be a

factor?
MR, LENZINI:
Your Honor.

I think it is simply a question of title,

I think that where the state owns minerals, it has

a patent, perhaps from the federal government, perhaps from
someone else, it has all of the indicia of what we consider to
be necessary to clecir title.
QUESTION;

You are proceeding on a premise that title

must rest somewhere, are you?
MR. LENZINI:

No, sir, I’m not.

are capableof ownership ordinarily
to wildlife

Title to things that

rest somewhere, but title

is in no one, it was held in common law to be res

nullius, it was owned by no one.

But although it was owned by

no one, there x-ras a right, a beneficial right to utilize the
wildlife, and it x-zas held to be in the state for the benefit of
its people.
Mr. Justice

That is the holding of Geer v„ Connecticut.

But

Marshall stated earlier this year in Douglas v.

Seacocst that it was fantasy to talk about the states owning
wildlife, because wildlife cannot be owned in the sense that a
private game preserve owner owns the animals he has stocked
therein.

And last year, in Kleppe v. New Mexico, talking agciin

about the nature of the state's interest, there Justice Marshall
statec. that the state has broad trustee and police power

27

interest in wildlife.
So we have difficulty in semantics on what is the
state's ownership.

In Toomer, Chief Justice Vinson stated that

there is considerable authority beginning with Geer to support
the contention that the State may confine the consumption of
fish and game wholly within its limits, and as the representa­
tive of its people, it can keep the fish and wildlife from mov­
ing in interstate commerce.
QUESTIONS

Are you suggesting that wildlife is not

capable of ownership under any circumstances?
MR. LENZINI:

If it is reduced to possession lav/fully

it is capable of ownership, and it is owned by the —
QUESTION:

By that definition it is not wildlife any

longer.
MR. LENZINI:
property.

It is no longer wildlife but personal

But prior to its being lav/fully reduced to possession

it is considered not to be held in technical ownership.
Eo it is clear from the cases that the State does not
have technical ownership in wildlife, but because of the fact
that ownership is in no one, but it is clear that the State's
authority over wildlife is that for the common good and conveys
all the authority that technical ownership ordinarily confers,
such es in Toomer where the court said it's important that the
State have the power to preserve and exploit the exploitation
of an important resource.

28

If the authority of the State must be expressed in
terms of police pov/er, however, appellees then submit that the
exercises of police power in managing wildlife is not incon­
sistent with the recognition of beneficial use therein by the
people, a user fructury

right, perhaps6

We then turn to appellants' equal protection claim.
It is alleged that residence is a suspect classification and
thus requires the showing of a compelling State interest to sus­
tain ;its use„

Appellees submit that the classification of resi­

dence cannot be said to be suspect.

It is not aimed at any dis­

crete minority such as classifications by race, religion, sex
or alienage and involved no fundamental right.
A non-resident's opportunity to hunt a prize trophy
species simply does not rise to the dignity of a fundamental
right and the record discloses that the non-resident hunter is
not a group who is in need of special solicitude under the
Const!tution„
QUESTION:

If someone had come to Montana and declared

his residence there, would he then, say ten days later, have
been able to get a resident license?
MR,, LENZIHI:
quirement.

Montana has a six-month residency re­

If he had resided for six months prior to the ap­

plication for the license, he would have gotten a resident's
permit„
QUESTION:

So it doesn't make any difference, once you

29

fulfill the six -months requirement, it doesn’t make any dif­
ference how much longer you've resided there, you can get a
resident's license?
MRo LENZINI:

That is correct.

A trial baloon the appellants attempted to show that
the license fee differentials could not be cost justified by
additional expenditures imposed on residents, and appellants’
witness testified that at most, under her calculations, the
State could charge a non-resident fee of 2.5 to 1.

This approach

is comparable, however, to the approach taken in the commercial
fishing cases, namely those fundamental rights cases where the
requirement of substantial equality between residents and non­
residents was involved, and it assumes that recreational hunting
is a fundamental right.
The district court below determined that no records
were Kept which precisely disclose the direct and indirect cost
which properly may be apportioned and thus the court found that
the ratio of 7.5 to 1 could not be justified on any basis of
cost allocation.
However, the court did not specifically address the
arguments that lie behind — pro and con, the arguments behind
the combination license issue in its view of the case.
The appellant below demonstrated, attempted to demon­
strate that the direct cost were those costs of the Fish and
Game Department itself and that indirect costs were all of the

30

costs spent by the State in that year vzhich amounted to about
$211 million, and when the appellants' witness below calculated
the number of person days that Montanans spent in Montana ver­
sus the number of person days spent by non-resident hunters, the
-fitness determined that one-tenth of one percent of all these
indirect costs could be utilized by the State as a cost of the
hunting license»
And the witness testified that no other cost than
these, no other forbearance, no other State interest could pro­
perly be considered in establishing the price of the hunting
service as it was stated.
Another of appellants’ witnesses testified that the
license fee should be determined on the basis of generally ac­
cepted accounting principles and that no one should become bog­
ged down in any measurement of value.
Appellees submit that the foregoing analysis is of
course unrealistict because it is many elements are involved in
producing big game populations that may be harvested in a State.
Private ranch lands are involved because during the critical
winter months of the year, elk and deer move down from the
higher elevations which tend to be Padera1ly-owned land and
move down into the lover private lands where they spend the
winter months, which are the critical months in survival, and
depend upon forage provided by those ranch lands.
QUESTIONS

Well, those ranchers can keep anybody off

of their land, can't they?
MR, LENZINI:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Well, I do not understand what you are ar­

guing .
MR. LENZINI:

I am saying that because of the deer

and the elk survive to a large extent because of the presence of
those ranch lands, and the mare fact that they could keep
hunters off the land does not mean that they keep the deer off
the land or the elk off the land.

And in fact,, they have no

recourse for the damage and depredations they may receive from
the deer and elk.
QUESTION:

Nell, I do not understand why for that rea­

son you have to charge so.uebody an extra amount of money?
MR. LENZINI:
QUESTION;

Wall, the —

Because the elk coraes in ny land and eats

my forage, therefore I keep the out-of-state man out.
MR. LENZINI:
on your land.

Yes, but the deer and elk are not taken

They come on your land during the winter months,

and during the summer months and the fall months they migrate
off your land and they move onto adjoining Federal land, and
that is where they are taken.

So they are being taken on lands

not your lands and they are being —
QUESTION:

My real question is, isn't it true that

Montana will survive if this law is knocked down?
MR. LENZINI:

Are we talking about the combination

32
license or are we talking about the license fae differential?
QUESTION:

If you take all the licenses away, Montana

will still survive?
MR» LENZINI:

I think Montana as a state will survive,

but then the question is whether the wildlife management program
will survive»

That is the question»

QUESTION:

This is the only State in the Union, you

agree on that?
MR» LENZINI:

This is the only state that I am aware

has a combination license„
QUESTION:

Well, that is what is before us»

MR. LENZINI:
Justice Marshall:

It is one of —

Well, there are two questions, I think,

There is the combination license and there
)

is the question of the fee differentials, and the fee differen­
tials is an extremely important management tool used by the
State Wildlife Agency and if that were held unconstitutional,
there would be a very significant impact on fish and wildlife
management, particularly wildlife management»
QUESTION:

.Are you arguing that a rancher who is

paying Montana State taxes on his land and whose land is then
used for forage by elk and others is entitled to special protec­
tion which can't be measured mathematically?
MR.. LENZINI:

No, Your Honor, I am not.

In some

states, in fact, like Colorado, there are provisions under
state statute for claims by ranchers for depreciations.

In the

33

State of Montana, the Legislature in its wisdom has decided not
to provide a claims procedure for ranchers, and therefore they
are required simply to undergo this depredation and loss of
forage»
QUESTION:

Well, then, they are contributing something

to the. well-being of the elk which non-residents do not con­
tribute?
MR„ LENZINI:
indeed.

I certainly submit that they are? yes,

It is an opportunity cost, because if they chose to

keep those elk and deer off of their ranch lands, they might do
better in some other pursuit.

They might be able to have more

forage, more grazing, but the Montana Supreme Court has said
that one who acquires property in Montana does so with notice
and knowledge that we have some very substantial big game
populations here, and he does so with knowledge that wild game
cannot, distinguish between fructus naturales and fructus industriales * *nd therefore cannot, control animals, they cannot be
\ controlled through the owner, and accordingly, a property owner
the State of Montana must recognize the fact that there may
\
i

be'some injury to property from wild game for which there is no
\

recourse.

And that is State versus Rathbone, .100 Pacific 2nd,

QUESTION:

Your answer, Mr. Lensini, to my brother

Marshall's question indicated your belief that this relatively
high license fee actually operated as a real disincentive to

34
non-resident hunting in Montana.
MR. LENZINI:

Do you think that's correct?

I believe it operates as a control.

I

believe the record indicates that in years when the Legislature
has raised the fee, there has been a dropoff in the number of
non-residents.
QUESTION;:

My observation* as well as I may say ray

personal experience has been* that this sort of recreation is
quite an extravagant pursuit* monetarily* and
MR. LENZINI;
QUESTION?

It is expensive.

-- and that the $200 fee is a rather small

fraction of the overall cost and would probably not* in fact*
operate as much of a disincentive to the kind of person who
comes from outside Montana and conies in there and hires a guide
and all the outfitting material necessary and indulges in big
game hunting.

Am I quite wrong about that?

MRo LENZINI;

I think you are correct.

I think that

the fee here is $225, I think that the record indicates that
over $1*000 is involved apart from that in spending 7 days in
Montana.
QUESTION;

At least, I would say.

MR. LENZINI;
tion, very expensive.

Yes.

So it is a very expensive recrea­

And the $225 is not that much, but the

plaintiffs —
QUESTION;

Well then it is not a disincentive?

MRC LENZINI;

Nell* the plaintiffs —

35

QUESTION:

And if it is not a disincentive, your case

is weakened, is it not?
MR. LENSINI:

No, I think not, because I think to some

extent it is a disincentive.

It is a control mechanism.

is why the plaintiffs are here.

That

Their witnesses say that they

cannot come back next year because of this license fee increase.
So as far as they are concerned, it is a disincentive, and that
is why they are here.
QUESTION:

If it is not an injury, in fact, to them,

I suppose they have r.o c3aim.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, if it does not dis­

courage any non-residents from coming in and hunting elk, then
you have no case.
MR. LENZINI:

Well, I think we can take notice of the

fact that an increased license fee is going to have an effect
on some people.
Now, it may not have an effect on the person who is
outfitted by Abercrombie & Fitch and comas out, but it is going
to have an effect cn some people, maybe from South Dakota,
maybe neighbors from Colorado, but it is going to have an effect
on some people.
This case is net a Toomer v. Witsell situation where
in the; year prior to the $2,500 license fee there were 100 non­
resident shrimp boats licensed and following enactment of that
license fee there were no shrimp boats licensed by the State of

35
South Carolina.

The effect of that case was to exclude non-

residents.
We have here instead a situation where in the period
1960 to 1970 the number of Montana residents hunting in the
state had increased by about 67 percent and the number of non­
residents had increased over 530 percent.

We have a situation

here where Montana in 1974 was the state most frequently
visited by out-of-state hunters.

We have a situation here where

during 1974 there were 32,000 non~x'esident big game hunters
and there were 20,500 non-resident combination licenses issued,
not 14,000 as stated by appellant.
QUESTIONs When was there a limit of 17,000?
MR. LEWS INIs

The limit of 17,000 carae into the lav?

later. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I sea.

MR. LEWSINI:

Faced with this increase in the number

of nor-residents, the Legislature simply increased the fee for
the non-resident license.

The state chose an economic means to

limit the number of hunter days and the method plainly is not
arbitrary.
With respect to the combination license, the record
below indicates that non-residents hunt in larger groups than
do residents, they usually come in groups of four or more, and
that license swapping is a problem and is likely to recur more
among nonresidents, whereas residents tend to hunt in smaller

f

37
groups, one or two.

In attempting to enforce its conservation

laws, the State of Montana has adopted the equal responsibility
law.

They have a state of about 145,000 square-miles, and they

have 70 game wardens at this time, which means that each game
warden, is supposed to cover an area of about 2,000 square-miles.
It is very difficult to do that.

But the state does have over

400 licensed outfitters and guides, and so the legislature in
its wisdom said that if a violation occurs in a hunting party,
which is guided by a licensed outfitter and guide, then unless
that guide os: outfitter reports the violation, he himself is
equally responsible with the person committing the violation.
Because of the fact that there is license swapping, because of
the practice of people going out and buying — one buys a
license for deer, one buys a license for elk, and then if they
come upon the one and he is not licensed for it, they still
may feel that they can take the deer or the elk? because of
that problem, the legislature decided to establish the combin­
ation license, so that whatever you tended to come across inso­
far as bear, deer and elk were concerned, you would be licensed
for that.

And the record below indicates that non-residents

utilise outfitters more than residents, perhaps as high as 50
percent in soma areas of Western Montana.
The dissenting opinion below said that the use of a
political justification, namely that without this discrimination
the program would not receive political support, the dissent

38
said that that was inherently inappropriate.

But appellee

submits that such political considerations are part and parcel
of numerous legislative choices and cannot be said to vitiate
the choice unless fundamental rights are involved or unless
invidious classifications are made.
We submit that in San Antonio School District v.
Rodriguez, decided by this Court in 1973, such considerations
were taken into account to determine whether there was a
rational basis for the Texas system of financing public educa­
tion.

In that case, the financing method was the ad valorem

tax or. property within the state's school district, supplemented
by funds from the state central system.
The attack on that, the equal protection attack was
on the basis of wealth, because some districts had less valuable
property than others, that school districts were being deprived
of their equal protection rights.

But the Court, referring to

local control of school districts, which was fostered by the
Texas plan, concluded that the plan was not irrational because
the people of Texas may be justified in believing that other
oysters of financing would lessen desired local autonomy.
And in Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Water District,
which involved beating in water districts but was limited only
to landowners, the Court said that there was no violation of
the Equal Protection Clause because the State of California
could conceivably take into account that landowners, as opposed

39

lessees or mere residents, would not be willing to join in
formation of the water storage district, short-term lessees,
for example, whose fortunes were not in the long run tied to
the lend, were to have a major vote in the affairs of the
district.
In sum, where a state possesses a qualified ownership
interest in a natural resource or at least a substantial regu­
latory interest which imports a right to the beneficial use
thereof, and which may be exploited by citizens of other states,
a state may prefer its own if the state regulatory program
'would be frustrated without such discrimination.
To sum up, there is room in the Fourteenth Amendment
for practical considerations where no invidious classification
is involved, where no fundamental right is involved, and whereas
here the state, in regulating a finite resource in which its
people: have a beneficial interest, the appellee submits that
the judgment below should be affirmed.
Thank you.

Mr. Goetz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. GOETZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS ~ REBUTTAL
MR., GOETZ;
QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Goetz, as I understand the record,

none cf your clients assert that they were actual residents of
Montana, who were denied license simply because they hadn't

40

fulfilled the six-month requirement»
MR, GOETZ:;

Am I correct?

That is correct.

durational residency requirement.

There is no issue as to

I might say in that connec­

tion that one of the non-resident plaintiffs, however, is a
propertyowner in Montana.

And I think one of the problems with

Mr. Lensini's argument on depredation is that he is equating
non-residency with property ownership.

There may foe non­

residents who own property who contribute likewise to the elk
resource.

Obviously, the incidence of that is lower than

resident propertyowners.
QUESTION;

Thera may be a lot of residents who don't

own property..
MR,, GOETZ;

That's correct also.

In respomse to the appellee's position, first I would
like to say with regard to the ownership question that I think
that this Court lias settled that issue in the recent decision
in Douglas v. Seacoast Products, where the opinion indicated
that, rather than viewing wildlife in some kind of ownership
contest, the property way to look at the wildlife resource is
through the traditional police powers concept, and that is the
position that appellants have taken throughout this decision.
I believe the language in Douglas v. Seacoast is very strong
in that regard.
Now, with respect to the equal protection issue, Mr.
Lenziri has argued that both the license

fee differentia], and

41
I understand also the combination license requirement, both of
those are very important management tools, and the thrust of
the District Court decision is that this is a valid conserva­
tion measure,

1 think the record throws substantial doubt on

that, for a number of reasons.
First of all, the State of Montana did not attempt to
justify this in the District Court as a conservation measure.
Secondly, Montana in 1975 charged residents only $4 to hunt an
elk.
QUESTIONs

Must

the legislature assert this con­

servation aspect in order to rely on it, in the passage of a
statute of this kind?
MR. GOETZs

No, I don’t think it has to assert that,

and we have very little legislative history in Montana*

How­

ever, what I am saying is that the state Fish and Game Depart­
ment, in defending the case in the District Coxirt, did not
assert that.

That doesn * t necessarily bar then from arguing it

now, but I think it does shed some doubt on whether they firmly
believe that this can be justified as a reasonable management
tool.
You see, there is no limit on the number of nonI

resident licenses that can be issued for elk, and they cost only
$9 now and —

MR, GOETZ;

Well, generally that is what they are,
In any event, the District Court seemed

to find that there are large numbers of hunters and a finite
number of elk, and 1 think there obviously is a finite dimension
on that resource, but the legislature has not imposed any re­
strictions on residents as far as hunting them,
QUESTION;
MR, GOETZ;
QUESTION;
MR, GOETZ;

What is the population of Montana?
600,000, approximately,
The whole state, men, women, and children?
Yes, and approximately 198,000 hunting

licenses are issued in Montana,

However, that relates to the

whole spectrum of game, birds, efc cetera,

QUESTION;

Rabbits, squirrels, and so on.

QUESTION;

There is a limitation on the number of elk

that may be taken?

MR, GOETZ::
QUESTION;

Yes,
On per licensed hunter?

43

MR. GOETZs

Yes, one per license.

What I am saying

is that if this is viewed as a conservation device, this
economic discrimination, designed to discourage non-resident
hunters, we concede likewise that there is no equivalent in
/

terms of the resident hunters.

And Douglas v. Seacoast Products

said that this cannot properly be viewed in the Virginia context
as a legitimate conservation measure, if you have no limits or
no policies discouraging the residents and simply discriminate
against the non-residents,
QUESTIONS

But Seacoast was not only commercial, it

was very high-powered commercial.
MR, G032TZ s

Well, that is true, but I think the propo­

sition for which I cite is, that is the difference between the
resident and the non-resident, and the fact that Virginia did
not take any measure to discourage residents, 1 think that is
applicable to the present case.
Now, in any event, if we lock at the combination
license requirement, we have something that appears wholly
arbitrary and capricious.

Now, for instance, in 1975, Montana

changed its combination license from one elk/two deer to one
elk/one deer and one black bear.
}

The record shows that with

respect on the average year to the latter half of the hunting
season, black bears are hibernating.

Now, what kind of conser­

vation device or management tool is that?
huntable —

They are not

44
QUESTION;

They could as well have licensed you to

hunt tigers, I suppose?
MR* GOETZ:
to shoot»

Yes*

They are just not going to be around

And in line with that, it is very difficult to

mistake an elk for a black bear if the black bear are hibernat­
ing, obviously.

And even if it is not hibernating, it is

rather difficult tc mistake those two.
QUESTION;

Is there a bear season in Montana?

MR., GOETZs

There is.

There are two bear seasons,

one ir the spring and then there is a bear season that is pretty
much the equivalent of the elk season.

And ray understanding is

that the spring bear season is different in the sense that the
combination license doesn’t impact that one way or the other.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any reason x*;hy a possessor

of a combination license couldn’t come back in the spring and
shoot a bear if he found they were all hibernating in the fall?
MR., GOETZ

i

I ’n not sure whether he has to buy an

additional license for that to start with*
that.

I just don’t know

But, secondly, there is an economic reason, of course,

it costs money to come into the state a second time, and the
record divulges that black bears are not in great demand.in
terms of hunting, that is, in 1975, the year before this went
into effect, 730 non-resident black bear licenses were issued,
as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood — Mr. Lensini,
correct me ■—» about 20,000 elk/dser combination licenses.

So

45
obviously, most non-residents who hunt want to hunt either elk
or deer, do not desire to hunt black bear.
So what it appear is as though the State of Montana
is doing is gouging the non-resident with higher fees to sub­
sidise artificially the operation of the Fish and Game Depart­
ment in Montana, while charging probably the non-residents an
unreasonably low figure, that is
QUESTIONS

But that argument doesn't militate against

the combination of elk and deer, does it?
MR. GOETZs
ential.

It is just that —

No, that goes to the license fee differ­

However, the problem with the economic problem, just

as Justice White pointed out, is compounded by loading on other
licenses and then saying, well, you have got to pay more be­
cause you have got to buy these other licenses.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't, as Mr. Justice White suggested

very early in your argument, isn't this really one problem?
Let's say that Montana had said that in order for you to hunt
elk ycu also have to be licensed to hunt tigers and elephants
and zebras, in other words, wholly unrealistic, but that is
what you have to do to get an elk license, and you pay $225 for
it?

Isn’t that realistically the same as though they set a

$225 iee on elk, period?
MR. GOETZ:

Well, in one sense it is, in the sense

that if you look at the combination license as simply a way to
assess more fees to the non-resident«

However, in a

46

consti.tutioaal sense, what that combination license is is excess
baggage, tha; is conceivably, although I don't believe it should
be the case, this Court could held up a reasonable or an un­
reasonable differentiation and still find the combination
license so arbitrary and capricious, which it seems to me it is,
that it would strike that down, and that would be the argument
1 would be making here if I thought that the differential was
reasonable under the Tooxner standard, notwithstanding the com­
bination license, that is we would just attack the combination
license,

However, we think that the differentiation cannot meet

the Tcomer Mullaney standards in any event, so to that extent;
1 think they are two separate issues.

And as Mr, Lensini

pointed out, he tried to justify the combination license on a
separate basis.
Thank you,
QUESTION*

Before you sit down, can you tell me if the

record tells us how many alk are taken by residents as opposed
to non-residents?
Mlh GOETZ*

Yes, the record does,

I can3fc fell you

offhand where it is,
QUESTION*

I thought you said earlier that it was

about a little less than half of the 31,000?
MR, GOETZ*

That is the number of hunters who hunt elk,
