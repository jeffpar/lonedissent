the parties as to the import of the evidence “that was before

evidence was..

Because this cas© was decided as

The evidence consisted of the pleadings in tie case,

Mrs. Berg's complaint, an amendment to it, a supplement to

it, the answer filed by the School District, limited
affidavits and exhibits presented by Mrs. Berg, and somewhat

4
1

2
3

more extensive affidavits and exhibits provided by the
School District.

And that is all the evidence there was.

That evidence shows that before December 1972,. the

4

School District maintained a compulsory maternity leave

5

regulation requiring teachers to terminate their service at

6

the «and of the seventh month of pregnancy and to take

7

maternity leave.

8

had an informal policy disallowing sick leave usage for

9

maternity purposes.

to

And the evidence shows that the District

In November of 1972 Mrs. Berg filed a charge with

11

the EEOC challenging these policies.

12

this charge contained the notation that she had had no cor­

13

respondence with the School District.

14

This charge was unsworn,

On December 13 of 1.972, the School District. Govern­

15

ing Board modified its maternity leave policy to permit

16

individual consideration of requests of teachers to work

19

policy as it had been modified the preceding day.

20

ber 20 Mrs. Berg submitted a second application for maternity

21

leave, and in that: application she asked permission to

22

continue work until term, until her child was born..

23

days later the School District replied in a letter to Mrs.

24

Berg stating that if she was going to work until that data,

25

the District wanted a physical examination by its doctor to

The next day Mrs. Berg: applied

There was intervening correspondence from Mrs. Berg's
attorney, and she filed suit in Federal district court on
February 5th.

On February 16th/ taking into account the

5

medical advice that the District had obtained in the inter­

6

vening period/ the District superintendent promulgated a

7

more elaborated pciicv for maternity leave, and Mrs. Berg was

8

notified that this revised policy would be applied in her

9

case.

10

In chronological orderf on the 21st of February

!1

Mrs. Berg received the notice of h@r right to sue under

12

title VIX, and on the 22nd she received a preliminary injunc­

13

tion from the Federal district judge.

14

In March/ on the 14th, she held h©r child and she

15

worked up until that time , and in June slid: supplemented her

16

complaint in the Federal district court action to allege her

17

receipt of statutory notice of her right to sue under Title

18

VII.

19

From the outset, the School District has challenged

20

the jurisdiction of the district court in this case.

21

our contention in fch-a first place• that her EEOC charge was

22

premature and that it was not a proper charge sufficiant to

23

found a Federal district court action under title VII.

24

the time that she filed this charge, th© District had taken

25

no action respecting her.

Tt is

At

The policy that she complained of

6

!

in the charge was modified before the District took any

2

action concerning her, and it was not until the 27th of

3

Decairber whan, a letter was written by the District to Mrs.

4

Berg that there was the first occasion, or occurrence, as. I

5

would call it, between the District and the aggrieved person

6

that I think she could complain about.

QUESTION:

Mr. Walenta, you are prejudiced how?

IS

MR. WALENTAs

w@ are prejudiced, for on© thing, by

19

becoming implicated in a legal proceeding based upon a charge

20

that was hypothetical and speculativa when filed and, in

21

fact, in a situation in which the facts changed between the

22

time the charge was filed and the time any action was taken

23

concerning Mrs. Berg.

2:4
25

Secondly, I think as a matter of law and as a
matter of policy, it is Congress that mandated that tills

7
1

EEOC charge be a condition that, a person is required to file

2

before they can file suit, in th® district court. They must

3

file suit a certain number of days after a charge.

QUESTION:

The latter doesn’t, bear on prejudice,' of

cours@, does it?

MR. WALENTA:

QUESTION:

8

I say th© latter doesn’t bear on your

prejudice in any way.
MR. WALENTA:

9
10

Excuse ma, Mr. Justice.

No? that is correct.

That is a

different issue.
In any ©vent, w© find no occurrence between th®

15

Charc-es for EEOC investigation and for th© various tins©

16

periods that are implicated in th© statute cannot be followed

17

unless one requires that there be a charge that is definite

18

as tc- occurrence and which shows an actual subject of actual

19

grievance on th® part of a complaining party before they can

20

file a Federal court suit.

We believe that Congress clearly mandated that a

One wants to sympathise, perhaps, with the decision

12

in the Henderson case, but we believe that it is wrong in

13

principle, and w® believe that there is a very serious

14

issue indeed about ascertaining whan a Federal court has

15

jurisdiction, and we believe that the proposition that

16

jurisdictional facts can occur to perfect jurisdiction that

17

did not exist when the suit was filed would leave the

13

courts with a rather intolerable situation.

file a cross-complaint in a Title VII case against a union

th© Third Circuit ruled that Title VII jurisdiction could not

She did not in fact leave until

MR. WAL3NTA;

That is correct.

The point is if

she was entitled to the relief that sh© received, notwith­
standing that h@r actual leave is moot, she is entitled to
award of her attorney’s fees, and we have to pay them.

So

that $5,000 is at issue regardless.

MISS DUNLAP:

Wall, it makes a difference here,

Mr. Chief Justice,, because of th® nature of the injury.

14

QUESTION:

On the legal issues?

15

MISS DUNLAP:

it makes a difference with respect

16

to th@ nature of the injury that would have been incurred

17

by Mrs.Barg had she been compelled to leave at a tim«. whun

18

sht was fully abl© to work for the Richmond School District

19

and k©ach her kindergartnars.

20

Tiie nature of her injury was such that the

21

district court, as: Mr. Justice Stswart has pointed out.,

22

issued a preliminary injunction solely on the basis cf its

23

jurisdiction over b&r 1983 claim of an invasion of her

24

cons*dtuticnal rights by virtu® of th© forced leave* policy.

25

Mrs. Berg, in November of 1972, was indeed a person

22
1

claiming to be aggrieved under Title VII for purposes of

2

filing her charge for the following reasons:
It was her doctor’s very best prediction — and in

8

4

the area of pr@gna.ncy we deal with predictions -- -that she

5

w°uld b© able to teach until the onset of delivery, that is

S

feo say, until the time the doctor believed she would be

7

confined for purposes of giving birth.

8

doctor recommended in a latter to the School District that

9

her state of health was such that she be permitted to

For that reason her

continue to teach.
Unlike my opposing counsel's statement of tee

record ~~ and I believe page 113 of the Appendix will

13

illustrate this

14

permit teachers as of November of 1972 to teach through

15

their seventh month, but only -through their sixth..

16

bears little importance to the question of whether the

17

leave was e. compulsory one, but in terras of ssi individual

18

whdss income and whose family livelihood depends upon that

19

person's being able to continue working and where that

2.0

parson's doctor’s advice is teat that person is capable of

21

doing so, one month or on® weak or even on® cay’s loss of

22

employment is actionable- and a matter of concern under

23

Title VII.

24
25

the policy of the District was not to

The stabasttcat of opposing counsel was teat leave

23

counsel's confusion about, th© various policies of the

2

District with respect to leave dates, for in the course of

3

this litigation the original policy on which Mrs. Berg filed

4

her charge, which appears at page 109 of the Appendix, was

5

a policy that would have required her not to work during

6

a period of three months when she was perfectly capable of

7

doing so.

Reality has demonstrated that fact to us.

What are w© supposed to do in tills

KISS DUNLAP;

11

I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

12

that the record is not confused on the points as to which

13

this Court, has thus ability to make determinations of law.

14

I merely wish to point out to the Court that the Richmond

15

Unified School District changed its so-called compulsory

16

leave policy telco in the course of this litigation but

17

retained the compulsion in that policy.

18

court observed, tl/3 compulsory nature of the policy with its

19

assumption of the inability of the individual to work and

20

its coercive element that that individual’s doctor6s judgment

21

was to be distrusted arid with the effect on the individual

12

with a deprivation of income was, regardless of when the

23

compulsion applied, a discrimination.

MISS DUNLAP:

QUESTIONS

7
8
9

Than how did th© district court on your

motion for summary judgment decide a question, like that?
MR. DUNLAP:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in this case

there is a local rule which requiras the party making a

to

motion for summary judgment to recite undisputed facts, and

11

at, I believe it's pages 101 and 102 of our Appendix,, those

12

facta which we believed to be undisputed and to be necessary

13

to tie district court9s determination of th© illegality of

14

this policy ar© set forth.

15

I wish to call this Court's attention to th® fact

16

that th© submissions of th© petitioners in this case, which

17

I believe appear at pages 105 through 107, do not dispute

$

18
19

20

■ ■ following facts which are critical to th© understanding
°£ the discriminatory natura of this policy:
First, that disabilities arising from pregnancy

21

ar© 'she only disabilities excluded from th© payment of

22

accumulated sick leave pay.

23

That, second, no other class of persons who can

24

bs predicted to be disabled are subjected to a classificatory

25

doubt of their doctors’ advice, an assumption — and I would
I

25
1

say a presumption would come to 'the fore, I believe

2

those individuals in their ninth month are incompetent,

3

incapable of teaching, awkward, incapable indeed, in the

4

words of Dr. Thebaut, of even controlling their urinary

5

functions, that, in short, these pregnant women in their

6

ninth month, all of them, mind you, can be excluded from

7

Employment by the District.
Now, in short, the basic facts in this cas© with

QUESTION:

MISS DUNLAP:

That is correct.

She. is included

among those who are in need of that relief and who were
afforded it below.
Mr. Justice Stevens, I wish to turn to your
question asked this morning because I believe, it has not yet

bmnn answered.

How ar© these policies discriminatory against

28
I

women on account of sex?

2

In the etas© of th© Richmond Unified School District,

3

the question is fairly ©asy to answer on the basis of a

4

record made, indeed, before th© Gilbert case was decided.

5

First of all, the Richmond Unified School District with

6

respect to pregnant teachers and no other group presumes them

7

incapable of working in their ninth month, untrustworthy in

8

terms of their doctors’ advice if their doctor says they may

9

work in their ninth month, and in short, that policy with

10

respect t© forced leave questions the judgment of these

11

teachers, these women teachers.

12

Education Association's amicus brief which characterizes

13

that particular presumption as insulting puts the matter

14

mildly.

MISS DUNLAP:

Yes.

You. argued that very forcefully in your

opinion between doctors as to the precis® time when a

21

pregnant person should discontinue teaching a Glass?

22

Do you think that there is room for a difference of

MISS DUNLAPs

I am sure ther® is a difference of

opinion with respect to that like any other health condition.
Doctors do tend to vary in their prescriptions for vacations.
QUESTION j

Than why would it b© irrational for the

29
1

Schoc.l Board to say it. would like to have its own doctor

2

form a judgment on that question?

3

MISS DUNLAPs

It is discriminatory because no

4

other class of parsons who can contemplate disability or

5

who are disabled <ind have recurring conditions ar@ subjected

6

to that untrusfcing interventionist requirement on th© part

7

of th© School District.

3
9

Additionally here w© have a factor that suggests
the Richmond School District’s policy is nothing morcR or

10

lass than the subterfuge that this Court defined as an

11

actionable form of conduct in Gilbert, namely, this School

12

District maintained that for purposes of leave these

13

teachers are presumptively disabled, and I cdll the Court's

14

attention to the affidavit of th*2 physician at pages 54

15

through 56 of the record in support of that, and simul­

16

taneously maintained that these same teachers who are dis­

17

abled., who are awkward, who are unable to walk around, who

18

are unable to teach their students are going to be deprived

19

of their accumulated sick leave pay.

20

I wish to turn to the very critical distinction

1973 to 1975 who by virtus of this District's denial of

That's the whole thing, that’s right.

It is.
With respect to the critical distinctions between
the deprivation o£ accumulated sick leave pay in this case
and the denial of disability insurance in the Gilbert case
I wish to call this Court’s attention to another statute.
Perhaps we have had too many statutes already, but this one
turns out to be quite important, namely, California Education
Cod®, Section 134.56, which is reprinted in the'appendix to
the petitioners’ opening brief in this Court.

The relevant

section of that statute,which w® believe is controlling on
the question of whether these petitioners could deprive

23
these women of their accumulated sick pay, reads as follows:
24
"Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive
25

I
<

32

any employ*;© of sick leave rights under other. sections of

2

this code for absences due to illness or injury resulting

from

pay.

MISS DUNLAP:

That's correct.

22

where this District asserts that for purposes of statutorily

23

accumulated pay — you earn 10 days a year of this for every

24

year that you teach full time -— -that they could nonetheless

MISS DUNLAP:

No, but a district court in a similar

case has construed, this very statute, namely, -the Oakland
Federation of Teachers v. Oakland School District case, which
is cited in our brief in

which the District Court for the
i

13

Northern District of California found that where that

14

district had argued that the statute afforded them this

15

option -—

16

QUESTION:

So this argument, if I get it correctly,

17

is that another distinction of the General Electric case is

18

that here you are entitled as a matter of State law to bes

19

paid and in defiance of State law you were not paid; therefore,

20

that shows that — what does it show?

21

MISS DUNLAP:

What evolves from that?

Basically what, it shows is that this

22

employer had no basis, none of the sort demonstrated in GE

23

and none of any sort that this is found to be a defense under

24

Title VII for denying accumulated sick leave pay.

25

Additionally, unlike the Stats of California in

3b

Geduldig v., Aiello, and unlike: General Electric Company as-

found by this Court, this School District had no option but

to afford 10 days of accumulated sick leave pay per year.

have made our prim® facie showing in two ways:

11

first this Court's- language about purposeful discrimination,

12

w© submit that the tandem operation of a presumption of dis­

13

ability among th©s® pregnant teach&rs with a presumption of

14

nondisability with respect to the accumulated sick leave pay

15

shows a purpose to discriminate against these pregnant women.
QUESTION:

16

Viewing

But they say it's the kind of disability

17

that makes it inappropriate for you to teach, but it3s not

18

tee kind of disability for which w® are going to allow sick

l©aw.

20

accept the basic reasoning of. General Electric?

21

Why is that discrimination on account of sex if you

MISS DUNLAPs

It's a discrimination on account of

22

sex because it's a whipsaw, I submit to this Court, that

23

were Genera]. Electric's mandatory leave policy before the

24

Court when it decided that case, it would have decided, as

25

the dissenting brethren pointed out, two policies in tandem

37
1

operation which for one purpose drove women out: of employment

2

at a time when they were able and for another purpose deprived

3

them of insurance benefits at a tint© that they ware disabled„

4

that in short this employer is saying for purposes of whatever

5

discretion we may have over your leave, w<$ presume you are’dis­

6

abled, and Idi© group is composed solely of women who, along

7

with their doctors, ara being mistrusted and suspected and

3

questioned and presumed incompetent for purposes of their

9

going on working and teaching, at the same time that the

10

school District is saying when it comes to accumulated sick

11

pay this is the on® condition for which we will not pay you.

12

I submit that that tandem operation of these two policies

13

makes a different case than this Court decided in the General

14

Electric situation.

15

May I briefly review a couple of other aspects —

QUESTIONj

17
18

You haven't dealt at all, Miss Dunlap,

and whether or not you do is of course up to you, with kh
jurisdictional issues raised by your brother.

MISS DUNLAP:

QUESTIONs

MISS DUNLAP:

I will try to do that in a very —-

Perhaps they are covered in your brief.

I will try to do that.in,.a very brief
*
I wish only to point out to this Court that

22

time.

23

Richmond Unified School District has argued that the whole*

24

question here is a matter of contract, at page 11 of their

25

reply brief, and that State regulations and laws form a part

S

38
1

of that: contract.

2

on this iss ae of ciccumulafead sick leave pay that by an

3

unwritten policy that has never bean justified in tills litiga-

4

tion, the Richmond School District deprived these women of

5

compensation which their own policy, namely, that appearing at

6

pages 74 and 75 of the Appendix, would have suggested these

7

women were entitled to.

8

of a subterfuge for discrimination that were absent in the

9

General Electric case.

And I would finally submit, to the Court

In short, w© have hare the elements

If this Court, remains in doubt about

TO

my characterization and balieves -that tiers are issues of

11

fact as to that subterfuge, then because we are her© in a-

12

summary judgment posture, a remand would be appropriate.

13

Briefly as to jurisdiction, first, the petitioners

14

allege that Mrs. Berg’s charge is unsworn.

15

simply forecloses ‘that argument because at page 109 she

16

signs and dates below the language,

17

I have read the above charge and that it is true," and so

18

forth.

19

notarized, and I submit to this Court that notarization is

20

not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the bringing of suit.

21

The record

”1 swear or affirm that

Basically what we have here is a charge that isn’t

The second issue raised by these petitioners is

22

whether she rushed to court too quickly.

I submit, first,

23

that the Ninth Circuit’s dictum with respect to the lower

24

court’s discretion to maintain the status quo under Title VII

25

is really of no special concern to this Court because the

39
1

district, court's jurisdiction to grant a preliminary Injunc­

2

ti on under 1982s is unquestioned and the final judgment in

3

this cas© imposed upon these petitioners under Titi® VII

4

rests upon a timely filed charge by an aggrieved individual

5

on the basis of which the Department of Justice issued a

6

right to sue, and the judgment was entered long after 180

7

days from the filrng of the charge»

QUESTION;

You would coneed® that it is the struc­

ture of the Act. tit at a parson can’t bring a Title VII action

10

until he or she gets a right-to-su© letter from the motion,

11

isn't that correct?
MISS DUNLAPs

12
13
14

It certainly appears to be.

That’s

correct.
QUESTION;

It appears to be, and this Court has

15

so understood it when it publicly said so in at least two

16

opinions, hasn’t it?

17

MISS DUNLAP:

That is correct.

However, this

18

Court’s decision in Occidental Lite Insurance Company v.

19

E.E.0.c. indicates that the Court’s concern is with private

20

individuals who completely avoid or circumvent the stages of

Miss DUNLAP;

She filed a 1983 action and a Title

VII complaint.

QUESTION;

A Title VII complaint before she had

5

been notified by the Commission of her right to sue, isn't

6

that correct?

7

MESS DUNLAP;

Before the letter had arrived in the

8

mail,, that's correct.

9

of the letter on the day it issued the preliminary injunction.

The court was informed of the issuance

10

Moreover, in this ease* Mrs. Berg faced —- I am sorry, the

11

district court faced the following choice;

12

was issued some 14 days after the suit was filed, it could

13

either require dismissal and refiling that same day or permit

14

supplementation of the complaint.

15

district court followed this Court's holding in Love v.

18

Pullman Tram Company by saying, "I won't require you to go

17

to them and pull that complaint out of the drawer, stamp it

18

dismissed, mid -then put in the letter and stamp it re filed.

13

I will permit supplementation."

The Department of Justice in

Could it, be issued any time up until

the day of final judgment?
MISS DUNLAP:

It seems to me that a notice of

right of action if issued, on the day of final judgment, that

25

would be a very unusual case, it seems to me, because how

42

would the district court have determined it had jurisdiction

at any earlier stage?

MISS DUNLAP:

QUESTION:

3

That is correct.

You may think that is wrong, but that is

what this Court has said, isn’t it?
MISS DUNLAP: 1 don’t resist that.

9

I simply would

to

suggest that the district court had no opportunity tc dismiss

11

this action before the time that the right—fco~sus letter was

12

issued.

13

filed on th«i 5th* a preliminary injunction was granted on

14

the 22nd* a right-to-sue letter was issued on the 21st* the

15

day before* the court was notified of that fact* and the

16

district court.as of the time the right-to~sue letter was

17

issued had that choice, should it require dismissal and

18

refiling or should it permit supplementation?

How could it have dismissed the action?

It was

/

19

I submit,

or@, that in this case, which is somewhat unusual in

2.0

its facts, the district court at the time that it determined

21

to allow supplementation had before it. both of the juri.sd.ic~

22

^ional prerequisites — the filing of the timely charge,

23

th? issuance of a proper and valid notice of right of action

24

from the Department of Justice.

25

QUESTION:

By your line of reasoning* I suppose you

43
1

would concede if the court issued a temporary restraining

2

order and required bond on the 5th and the right-to-su©

3

letter hadn't arrived until the 21st, perhaps damages could

4

be recovered on that bond, but the district court really

5

took no action on the complaint until after all the juris-

6

^cfcional prerequisites were present.

7

MISS DU Si LAP:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

S

I think w© are in a difficult posture her® arguing what

9

might have been tie c&s® if the district court had not had

IQ

1983 jurisdiction to do precisely what, it did, and as this

11

Court itself pointed out, although it cut in a different

12

direction, the equal protection concerns here and the Title'

13

VII concerns -here are not so far apart.

14

QUESTION;

I can't see.why you would bs satisfied

15

in saying that in this case, special as the facts are, it

16

is possible to do it tills way rather than to b® asking us

17

to nuke a blanket approval of it.

13

MISS DUNLAP:

Oh, I don't request a blanket approval

MISS DUNLAP:

That’s what I asked you.

Oh, I am sorry.

I meant, to be much,

22

clearer with you about that.

approval is necessary in this case because 1 don't think the

24

issues that you. suggest are necessarily to be determined in

25

this case.

I don’t think any blanket

X think they need not be reached by this Court.

QUESTION:

Let me give you another suppos® to the

2

case.

3

Let's just suppose that in every respect -this case is moot

4

on the merits and that everybody agrees that it is just

5

moot, that the Stata law has given you every piece of

6

relief on the merits that you could want.

7

do with respect to —- normally, if a case is moot, we

You have a judgment and an award of attorneys1 fees.

Do you think, then, the possibility of

You know it; doesn't.
MISS DUNLAP:

I believe it does not.

You know it doesn't, and yet I believe

a case that moots out when it has been filed hare, we strip
it down and the petitioner is left with his costs.
MISS DUNLAP:

I assure you vary quickly attorneys'

fees are a form of relief specifically prescribed under
Titia VII that would require certain legal determinations,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. WALENTA:

3
4

OF ARTHUR W. WALENTA, JR,

May it pleas© the Court, I will reply

very briefly only to a couple of points.
The District does not concede the validity of a

5
6

■^983 cause of action against Superintendent Snodgrass

7

individually.

8

°ur view, that shows any nexus or connection between any

9

conduct on fcb© part of that man and Mrs. Barg's claims.

There is nothing alleged in the pleading, in

It

10

is very troublesoma representing public agencies to have

11

some officer picked out and stand with a suit when he is two

12

or three points removed from what actually happened.

13

not concede that.
QUESTION:

MR. WALENTA:

QUESTION:

23

25

Than the case can't possibly be moot,

can it?
MR. WALENTA;

21

22

Thar© is no question on the sick

leave.

Do you concede there still is remaining

an issue as to whether or not -this lady should receive some

That's true.

MR. WALENTA:

Yes, but, of course, there are two

issues.
QUESTION:

15
16

But didn’t th© order itself say that you

were enjoined from not paying the sick leave money?

13
14

That is correct, your Honor.

And what does ‘that mean?

You are

enjoined from not paying; it means you pay.
MR. WALENTA:

17

Oh, yes, th® sick leave issue is not

18

moot.

19

20

the last say on th" question of leave for maternity is one

21

that has bean manifestly affected by change in California

22
23
24
25

The issue of the right of th© District, to require

law.
I would hope, though, that th© Court would take
into account the fact this was a change that was made; because
th© legislature thought that, th© Federal law required the

49

contrary.

history of this Court and its examination of legislation

and its effect on questions of mootness, because by virtu®

of that legislation, w® didn't get reimbursed for the

Yes. So you lost, but if we vacated
