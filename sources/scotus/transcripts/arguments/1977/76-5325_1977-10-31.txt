MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Humber 76“5325* Browder against Illinoise
Mr0 Flaxman, you may proceed whenever you are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N» FLAXMAN, ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» FLAXMAN:

Thank you»

Mr„ Chief Justice* and may it please the Court:
This case*as it was decided by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in an unpublished*
non precedential opinion* involved several Fourth Amendment
questions* each arising out of the warrantless arrest one
evening of the four teen-age black males found one night in
the Browder dwelling in Chicago* Illinois.
The Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections*
the Respondent in this Court* asked this Court to resolve the
Fourth Amendment questions on the basis of evidence received by
the District Court at a hearing on an untimely motion to reconsider0

This is precisely what the Court of Appeals did.

relied on that testimony.

It

It resolved disputed questions of

fact in the first instance and it reversed the decision of the
District Court.
The first question which the Court could resolve in
this case and which could* indeed, be dispositive of all the
other issues presented* is whether the Court of Appeals

was

4

correct In relying on the testimony which had bean heard by the
District Judge on untimely motion to reconsider.
It is our position that the District Court lacked
jurisdiction to entertain that untimely motion to reconsider
and that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider
the appeal from that untimely motion to reconsider, and that
what the Court of Appeals should have done would have been to
dismiss this appeal.
QUESTION:

Well, if we reach that and decide it, we

need not decide any other question.
MR o FLAXMA N:

Isn't that so?

Tha fc c s c orrec t.

The other question which the Court could also resolve
is whether it is appropriate for the Court of Appeals to rely
on an unpublished opinion ruling, to a priori deprive its
decision of precedent.
It is our position that the use of that rule is
interrelated with the disposition of this case and that question
could also be considered by the Court.

But the only issue

which the Court need decide in order to grant Mr. Browder the
primary relief which he desires is to find that the Court of
Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the decision of tie
District Court, and that the District Court's order granting
Mr. Browder's application for writ of habeas corpus should be
reinstated and Mr. Browder reenlarged from custody.
The time limits in which a motion to reconsider may

5
be made have for the last thirty years been delimited by the
ten days of Civil Rule 59°

The motion to reconsider in this

case was made twenty-eight days after entry of the final order,
and was untimely under Rule 59.
QUESTION;

Mr. Flaxman, I suppose that's the argument

isn't it, as to what is the final order?
MR„ FLAXMAN:

The final order is the order which

disposes of the case, the order which leaves nothing to be
done except to execute what the District Judge —
QUESTION;

Well, that has to be your position, but

suppose one could argue that January 26 order was the final
order?
MR. FLAXMAN:

That argument could be made but it

would be contrary to the type of final order which is appropri­
ate in habeas corpus cases, and which this Court has been
directing the lower courts to enter ’when an order less than
unconditional release is appropriate.

This goes back to, I

think, Chessman v. Tests where, there was $oe» proMcm in the
way the State court record had been prepared.

This Court felt,

properly, I believe, that it would be improper to release
Mr, Chessman because of this procedural error which could be
cured, and directed the District Court to enter such orders as
would be appropriate to alloxv the State a reasonable time to
cure the error, failing which the prisoner would be released.
That's what the District Judge did in this case.

Ke decided

6
that the petition should be granted and he told Illinois that
they had 60 days to retry Mr0 Browder# failing which the
writ would be executed,
QUESTION:

Your position is# In effect# if the judg­

ment as to the invalidity of the State conviction was final
then the State was just given a couple of alternatives as to
what to do in consequence of that determination,
MR, FLAXMAN:

That's correct.

That's the appropriate

kind of final order when an order less than outright release
is appropriate.

And the Btate could have retried Mr, Browder

if it had acted within that 60 days.
too congested,

The State courts were

I am sure the warden could have come to the

District Judge and said# "We need more time to retry hin
because there are delays in the State court," and the District
Judge# I think# would have extended that time and they would
have had ample time to retry him if that's what they wished
to do,
QUESTION:

Of course# the District Judge did stay

the earlier order pending further hearing# didn’t he?

Pending

the evidentiary hearing,
■ MR. FLAXMAN:

That’s correct.

And I think he erred

in doing that# but whether he erred in doing that Isn't really
before this Court because we didn't seek review at that stage.
We objected to the District Judge proceeding with the hearing,
pointing out to him that the time in which he could alter or

7
amend his earlier order had elapsed, but the District Judge
proceeded with the hearing and received evidence.
The argument that is raised by the Director as to
why that order granting the petition wasn't the final order is
the claim that that order left unanswered the question of whether
or not an evidentiary hearing would be required.

That's a

difficult point to understand because it seems obvious that
when a District Judge said this petition should be granted on
the State Court record he was making a decision that no hearing
was required, and he was making a decision that the state
should appeal his order that the State should retry Mr. Browder
or the State should release him from custody.
What the State did rather than to follow one of those
three permissible alternatives was to file an untimely motion
to reconsider and ask the District Judge to hear further evi~
denca and read judicate the lawfulness of the arrest.
The District Judge lacked jurisdiction to hold that
hearing and the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to
consider the appeal from that -~
QUESTION:

What would have happened if ;he State had

made that motion one day after the original order was filed?
MR, FLAXMAN:

Then it would be timely under Buie 59»

The time to appeal would be told.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in this record to

explain why they did not?

8
MPL FLAXMAN:

There is nothing in this record to

explain why they did nots and there has never been any
explanation by tne State or by the .director as to why they
waited 28 days.

This rule is not a novel rule, but there is

no explanation.
The other fact about the untimellness is that the
district Judge in this case did nothing to lull the Director
into failing to, appeal within the 30 days of Rule 4 of the
Appellate Rules.

The motion was filed on the 28th day.

Under

local rules in the Northern District of Illinois, it could have
been presented in open court for a ruling at that time.

But

instead it was filed and allowed to lay dormant on the District
Court's calendar.

So there was a decision of the Director to

rely upon the presumed power of the District Judge to recon­
sider a final order after more than 10 days had elapsed.

The

District Judge lacked that power and should not ha\re received
evidence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flaxman, the Respondent's brief

places some weight on a .decision of this Court a couple of
years ago in United Utates ,v. Dieter which involved a
criminal prosecution rather than a civil one.
:u. you filed a reply brief or not.

I don't know

In other words, how do you

distinguish Dieter?
MR. FLAXMAN:
ano

Dieter is consistent with cur position.
, Healy aarose fr0m cases under the

9
Criminal Rule where under Rule 4(b) of the Appellate Rules,
there is no totaling rule on motions to reconsider,,

So that

in criminal cases when a motion to reconsider is filed by the
Government in the time in which an appeal could be perfected,
the filing of that motion totals the time to appeal.

This same

rule is inapplicable to cases where appealability is determined
by .Rule 4(a).

Dieter states the general rule which is applic­

able, that only timely motions to reconsider stay the time to
appeal.

In Dieter a timely — In a criminal case, a timely

motion is one filed within the time in which the Government can
appeal.

In a habeas corpus case, in a civil case, in any case

where appealability

or where the time to appeal is governed

by Rule 4(a) a timely motion to reconsider is one made within
the 10-day period of Rule 59.
QUESTION:

But is Dieter entirely dependent on

provisions of the rules?
MR. FLAXMAM:

It is dependent upon the absence in

Rule 4(b) of any provision — any rule or statute authorizing
petitions for rehearing, as with United states v, Kealy.

That's

what differentiates this case and that case.
The argument is also made that Rule 4(a) doesn't
apply to habeas corpus cases.

The contention is that the

totaling rules of 4(a) are in direct contravention of the
conformity clause of Civil Rule 81(a)(ii), but if we look at
the predecessor of Civil Rule 81(a)(ii), that is former Civil

10

Rule 81(b) which was in existence when the time to appeal was
set by the Civil Rule, we see the totaling rule from the Civil
Rules were expressly and fully applicable to habeas corpus
proceedings.

The other Civil Rules were applicable only

insofar as habeas corpus practice had conformed to practice in
civil cases, but the Civil Rules when they governed appeals
were fully applicable to appeals in habeas corpus cases.
So what we have is applicability of the 10-day
totaling time.

And unless this Court' concludes that the order

granting the petition and leaving nothing to be done but to
appeal or to execute what the District Court had finally
determined was not the final order, then the conclusion we have
is that the motion to reconsider was untimely and that the
appeal from the denial of the untimely motion to reconsider
did not vest the Court of Appeals with jurisdiction to review
the merits of the District Court's final order, that the Court
of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's decision.
Even if the Court of Appeals did have jurisdiction
— and it is our position that it is clear it did not have
jurisdiction «— the Court of Appeals, as the Respondent in this
Court, resolved the Fourth Amendment question by making its
own findings of fact by reading the testimony heard by the
District Judge at the hearing on the motion to reconsider in
the light most favorable to the warden who is the losing party
in the District Court.

The ordinary rule followed by Courts

11
of Appeals is that factual questions which were in dispute are
resolved on appeal in the light most favorable to support the
judgment entered.

If the Court of Appeals had followed that

view, it would have decided the probable causa question in this
ease the way the District Judge had decided it on the State
Court record.
QUESTION:

The District Court's freedom to find

facts is somewhat limited by the 66th Amendment to the Heibeas
Corpus Act, though, isn't it?

If there has been a State Court

record made on the point?
MR. FLAXMAN:

That's correct.

In this case, this is

why we come under the exception in Stone v. Powell.

The

legality of the arrest and the questions relating to probable
cause that you asked weren't heard and decided in the State
Court.

There was no full and fair adjudication of this issue

In the State Court.
QUESTION:

Stone v. Powell says if you have an

opportunity to make the claim.

It doesn't say there has to

have been an adjudication.
MR. FLAXMAN:

That's correct.

But when there hasn't

been an adjudication — as in this case there hasn't been -I think Stone v. Powell says that there has to be a full and
fair opportunity.

And when the question hasn't been adjudicated

I think full and fair opportunity has to be right together
with Walnwrlght v. Sykes.

Whan the issue wasn't raised at trial,

12

the rule that has to be applied-by the State Court to determine
if there is a full and fair opportunity -mould be to allow the
prisoner to show cause for \«?hy it wasn't raised and prejudice
resulting from the default of trial counsel*
That's what the District Judge did in this case.
Before he adjudicated the Fourth Amendment questions, ha de­
cided whether or not the question had been waived by the
failure of trial counsel to have raised it In the trial court.
The Director argued that this question should be
resolved in the State Court record In favor of a waiver, •
under the precedent then extant in the Seventh Circuit, and
the District Judge considered that question and found that
under that case which adopted standards virtually Identical to
those adopted by this Court in Wainwright v. Sykes,that the
question had not been waived and should be c ons id er 3d In
federal habeas corpus, as the Court said in Henry v„ Mississippi
when it made clear that the states can apply any procedural
waiver rule that they feel appropriate,

because if they

nonetheless refuse to adjudicate a constitutional question
it is open to the federal courts to determine whether or not
the procedural rules followed by the state court measured up
to federal standards,
QUESTION:

But ¥aInwright v. Sykes didn't deal with

any Fourth Amendment problem which Stone v. Powell did deal with.
I would have read Stone r» Powell to preclude review on habeas

13
corpus if there had been an opportunity to litigate the
question without regard to the cause and prejudice requirements
of Walnwrlght v. Sykes in other types of claims.
MR* FLAXMAN:
way*

I would have read it exactly the same

I think we have to read —

I read Walnwrlght v, Sykes

as defining what opportunity means*
QUESTION:

But not for Fourth Amendment purposes,

for right of counsel types of claims*
MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, I think that’s a narrow reading

of Walnwrlght v* Sykes, that the case has to be read together
with the issues decided in that case and with Stone to define
what a full and fair opportunity is.

In this case, as in

Walnwrlght v. Sykes, he had opportunity to raise the
constitutional claim to trial.

It wasn’t raised in this case.

We didn't have any opportunity in the State Court to show that
there was cause for why It wasn’t raised and that we were
prejudiced from It not being asserted.

I think if those two

cases are read together we come out with this case not being
controlled by — with Fourth Amendment relief not being barred
by either Stone or Walnwrlght.

And if this Court agrees that

the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction, that is that the
final order was entered on October 21st and that notice of
appeal was untimely with that order, then of course there is
no question about Stone or about Walnwrlght*

This case would

have reached a final judgment because the appeal wasn’t taken

14

and there has been no contention that those cases should apply
retroactively to cases where relief had been granted which had
reached a final judgment where a prisoner had been enlarged,
or virtually enlarged,
As the Court of Appeals resolved the probable cause
question -** which is the way that the Respondent, will, I think,
ccsne before this Court and argue the probable cause question —■
the Court of Appeals believed that the police officers had
reasonable grounds to suspect that the person who had committed
the crime was one of tvio persons.

And the Court of Appeals

held that under those circumstances it was permissible for the
police to enter a dwelling at night without a warrant and
arrest both of these persons, even when the offense under
investigation had taken place two days before,
QUESTION:

What time did they enter the dwelling?

MR, PLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

At 6:00 p„m„

And it was night?

MR, PLAXMAN:

Well, it was a January da3>- which, I

think, we can acknowledge was nighttime in Chicago.
QUESTION:

Are you placing any emphasis on that fact?

MR, PLAXMAN:
are threefold.

We are.

The Fourth Amendment questions

Perhaps, the first question is whether it was

lawful for the search of the dwelling to be undertaken in the
absence of exigent circumstances without a search warrant.

The

court has considered that question and has refused to adjudicate.

15
QUESTION;

I suppose the opposition will take the

position that there were exigent circumstances here.

Are you

relying on the fact that it was what you call "night” even
though in May it would be all right?
MR. FLAXMAN:

It is our position it would have been

irrelevant whether it was daytime or nighttime* but in this
case it was nighttime.
QUESTION;

That's wliy I asked the question.

MR. FLAXMAN;

Well, in this case, it was nighttime.

In the next case, when it was daytime, I think that question
should be decided, but here we have the evil in its mostobnoxious form,which is nighttime entries to a dwelling.
If that reserved question is to be decided —
QUESTION:

It is a little different from 3:00 a.m.,

isn't It?
MR. FLAXMAN:

It is different in degree, but It is

still nighttime.
QUESTION;

What about the consent factor?

MR. FLAXMAN:

The consent should have been raised

by the Director in the District Court.

The Director had two

opportunities to show that the arrest was lawful.

The petition

squarely put in issue the illegality of the search based on the
absence of a warrant,

Mrs. Browder was in the District Court.

She testified there was no attempt made by the Director to show
that there was consent.

16

QUESTION:

But didn't the record show that she talked

with him and told him that she thought one of them was guilty?
MR. FLAXMAN:
that she said that0

The record shows that police testified

The record also shows that she testified

denying having said that.
QUESTION:

Did she deny having admitted it freely?

MR8 FLAXMAN:

She wasn't asked about that when she

testified.
QUESTION:

My question was:

MR0 FLAXMAN:
deny or agree with it.

Did she deny it?

Did she deny it?
She was asked:

She said: ,!The police carae to the door.

She wasn't asked to

What happened?
I asked them what

they wantedv" They said, "We are here for your sons.1’
If she had refused to allow the police entry she
probably, under Illinois law, would have bean arrested for
refusing to assist an officer in discharging his duty.
QUESTION:

Did she tell them, "Don't eome in"?

MR. FLAXMAN:
in."

Mo, she didn't tell them, ".Don't come

If she had fold them, "Don't eoiae in," —
QUESTION;

That I am not interested in.

I ara

interested in the record.
MR. FLAXMAN:
point,

Well, the record wasn't made on this

I think it is clear that the duty of showing an

exception to the warrant requirement is borne by the party who
is trying to uphold the legality of the search.

17

QUESTION:

What does the State Court record show

about the consent factor?
MRs FLAXMAN:

The State Court record shows what I have

just answered to Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

It shows no claim of a forcible entry.

MR. FLAXMAN:
forcible.

Vie are not claiming that the entry was

We are claiming that —
QUESTION:

It shows* on the contrary* that the police

testimony was she consented to the entry and peraltted them to
enter the house.

That's not disputed.

MR. FLAXMAN:

The consent that's shown by the record

is the same kind of consent or accession to official demands
that has been rejected by the Court as being a knowing and
voluntary consent entry.

In this case* the police officers

weren't knocking on doors asking questions.

They spent the

evening getting together to go out to the Browder household to
arrest some people.

It is difficult to see how these police

officers would have taken no for an answer when they arrived at
the Browder residence and said, "We are here to look at your
sons* Mrs. Browder."

There were four officers who got together

to go out to the Browder household to arrest the people there
and find out which one would be identified.

The police officers,

before they went to the Browder household* knew — or so they
claimed — knew they would have to arrest more then one person*
and they knew they would be making an arrest for investigation,

18

an arrest to investigate whom should be charged»

That's the

kind of power this Court has been reluctant to allow police
officers to exercise, consistent with the Fourth Amendment.
The way we read Davis v, Mississippi is that whenever
the police are engaging in a planned .investigative series of
arrests the only conceivable way that that could be authorized
would be if it ted been previously authorized by judicial
offieers as the American Law Institute, for example, has read
Davis and has suggested a model statute allowing limited
detention.
In this case^the police suspected that the person
they were seeking might be one of the persons in that room,in
that dwelling, and they went and seized all of them..
was ample opportunity to get a warrant.
be seizing more than one person»

There

They knew they would

And that power, the power to

arrest to clear up an investigation, is the power which strikes
at the.
QUESTION:

Would you concede that if the police had

reasonable grounds to believe that one of the four was guilty
of this rape that would have given probable cause for them to
arrest all four of them?
MR. PLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

No, I would not concede that.

Well, what do you mean there was ample

opportunity to get a warrant?
MR» FLAXKAN:

What I mean is that everything the police

19
knew on January 29th when they went to the Browder household
they knew two days before when the rape was reported.

If they

did know that the offender was a teenager named Browder who
lived in that block, they knew that right after the rape and
they waited two days to act on that.

They could have done

further investigation in those two days.

They could have shown

They could have gone to a

prosecutor and confronted him with their problem and said,
should we do?

We think it is one of several people»

those things*

They didn't do any of

They had ample time to do something other than

to get together that evening and go out and arrest everybody
there.

So we don't concede that under those circumstances it

is reasonable, it's lawful for the police to make a warrantless
arrest of four people in the expectation or in the hope that one
of them would be Identified.
QUESTION:

There were two teenagers at that address

named Browder, weren't there?
MR* FLAXMAN:
Browder.

Two teenagers who said their name was

There were two other teenagers who said their names

may

have suspected they were

They were there to arrest a teenaged Browder, like 16,

17, 18, 19.

20

QUESTION:

And there were, in fact, two of them?

I mean that said they were Browder»
MR» FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:
being Browder's.

That's correct.

Well, is there any question about their

When ycu say they said they were Browder’s.

MR, FLAXMAN:

They admitted to the name Browder.

There were two other teenagers who said they weren't, that
their name wasn't Browder, but the police officers didn’t
believe the two Browder's when they said they didn't commit
tife rape, and they very well might not have believed the twoother teenagers when they said, ?50ur last name isn't Browder»"
QUESTION:

Isn't It conceded there were two brothers

by the name of Browder?
MR, FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

Who were picked up among the four?

MR. FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

It is conceded,

That's correct.

Let me ask you another question.

Suppose

your client, Ben Earl Browder, were the only one there.

Would

you be making the same argument?
MR. FLAXMAN:
in addition to others.

I would be making the same argument
At the time — What we have to do is

look at what the police knew at the time they entered the
Browder residence to make the arrest, and if they had gone —
QUESTION:

Would you answer the question.

be making the same argument?

Would you

21

MR. FLAXMAN:

I would be arguing that they lacked

sufficient probable cause to arrest anyone, based on what
they knew.

They had enough information to get a general

warrant to search the 4000 block of Monroe Street.

They

didn’t know that this Browder family was the only Browder
family who lived in this block.

They made no attempt to

determine if there were other teen-age Browders.

If, for

example, there had been three Browder families, each with five
teen-age sons, this quantitative information would have allowed
the arrest of fifteen people.

The police simply didn’t do

enough in this case to narrow the focus to any identifiable
person.

The only arrest warrant they could have gotten would

have been a general warrant and that simply is not enough.
QUESTION:

If the victim says,

"The person who

committed the crime against me, his name is Browder and he
lives at a particular number on a particular street," would
that be sufficient to go and arrest him?
MR. FLAXMAN:

That would be sufficient to go and

arrest him.
QUESTION:

:3b the only difference is they didn't

give him the specific number,
MR. FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

Nell, that’s the first difference —

Is that right?

MR, FLAXMAN;

That’s the first difference.

you. are saying is correct.

What

There is another distinction in

22

that once the police got there they found there were several
people who matched that description.
QUESTION:

My point was:

But he could have arrested

a Browder.
MR. FLAXMAN:

They would have had probable cause to

go out and arrest a Browder.
QUESTION:

Weil they did arrest two Browderfe.

MR. FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

What's wrong with it?

MR. FLAXMAN:

Once they saw that there was more than

one person who matched that description who lived at that
address —
QUESTION:

So if a man says that r:The guy that killed

me, his name is Jones and he lives at 213 M Street," and you
go to 213 M Street and you find two people named Jones, you
can't do anything?
MR. FLAXMAN:

I’m not saying you can't do anything.

What you can't do is arrest both of them to find out which one ~
QUE3TI0N:

What could you do in that situation?

You find two people who say "My name is Jones."
MR. FLAXMAN:
determination:
promptly?

The police first have to make a

Is anything going to happen if we don't act

If they believe that those people are going to flee,

then we have a different situation than we have here.

Here

we have the police calling ahead finding out there are two

people
QUESTION:

What could they do when two people say

,!My name is Jones"?
MR, FLAXMAN:

They have to make that first decision:

Are they both going to flee if we don't do anything?
QUESTION:

Well, seeing it both ways.

MR, FLAXMAN:

Well, If they make the determination

that nothing is going to happen if they don't do anything,
if both of these people are upstanding members of the community,
they are not going to leave, then the police can't arrest them,
QUESTION:

I didn't say anything about upstanding

members of the community.

How do you know whether a man is

MR, FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

I get the —

I assume if you come and say you are lookin

for a man named Jones who committed murder, so that you can
arrest him and convict him, the chances are he might leave.
Which one of them would you arrest?
MR, FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

Which one would you arrest?

MR, FLAXMAN:
could arrest both*
question:

Under those circumstances --

In that hypothetical, I think the police

The problem would be the search warrant

Would it be lawful to enter a dwelling to arrest

both of them?

And it would still, we argue, need a warrant —

QUESTION:

Well, in line with our cases, if he came

24

to the doorway and they saw him could they arrest him?
MR» FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

If they had probable cause to —

If he came to the doorway, could they

have arrested him?
MR o FLAXMAN:

If1 this. Court has..held that a warrant

is in need in that situation, the answer would be yes.
QUESTION:

So they could have arrested both of them

MR» FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

If they were both in a public place -

No, no, no.

In the doorway of their own

home.
MR. FLAXMAN:
QUESTION:

If they were in the doorway, yes.

And the men were inside the room.

MR. FLAXMAN:

Thatrs our argument.

The warrant is

needed to enter.
If I may, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Flaxman.

Mr. McKoski.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND MeKOSKI, ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MeKOSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to briefly address the issue of the
arrest, the probable cause for the arrest and the nature of
the entry.

I'll keep my remarks very limited in this regard.
It is important to keep in mind exactly what the

police knew when they went to the Browder residence,,

On

January 29th they found out from the victim of the rape that
her assailant was the brother of a person the victim went to
school with.

She knew that he was a dark complected male

Negro in his late teens, approximately 17 years of age, his
last name was Browder and he lived in the 4000 block of West
Monroe.

She had narrowed it down to one block.
This information was received on January 29th by a

homicide investigator, Stan Thomas.

It was not until the 31st

of January, two days later, tl*at Mr. Thomas conveyed this
information to the juvenile authorities who then went out and
arrested.

On January 31st, the juvenile officers received the

information about 4:00 or 4:30 in the afternoon and had made
the arrests by 6:00 at night.

In that intervening time, they

had located a Browder family on the block.

They had located

a juvenile record on one Tyrone Browder who lived at 4053 West
Monroe.

They had personally interviewed the victim of the rape

themselves to verify the information that Mr. Stan Thomas gave
them.

They also called for a backup squad.
At 6:00 o'clock they proceeded to the house.

■**•» One

other thing I forgot that's very important. — Before they went
to the house, the juvenile officer who was heading the investi­
gation called the Browder residence and talked with the mother
of Tyrone and Ben Earl Browder.

He asked her if the sons were

home and she said yes, and he said, "Would you mind keeping

26

them there until we get there?”

The police then got in their

car and went over to the Browder’s residence,,
In this time, Mrs. Browder had an opportunity to
think over what she wanted to do when the police came there,
if she wanted to change her mind since the phone conversation.
The police arrived, knocked on the door, and Mrs. Browder
opened the door and the testimony of the police officers:
"Invited them in."

They went in.

The arrest was made.

No search was conducted.

Miranda warnings were given and the four

gentlemen were taken to the police station.
QUESTION:

I take it you are conceding that the four

were arrested at that time.
MR. McKGSKI:

Your Honor, I believe that the real

explanation - I am not hesitant to concede that for the
purposes of argument the four were arrested.

I think what

really happened in that contest -» and the juvenile officer
who was in charge of the investigation so testified *-- they
went to the house.

They knew two Browder’s would be there

and they arrested both Browder’s because they both fit the
description.
there.

There were two other young teen-age black males

The police knew that there was a second assailant.

Sharon Alexander was raped by a man named Browder, but there
was also another assailant 'with Browder at the time who also
raped her.

So, Mr. Conroy testified that he thought maybe one

of the other two could have been the second assailant.

That’s

27
why he asked the other two if they would go along to the
police station to stand in the lineup,

Mr, Conroy testified

they "volunteered to go with" and that was how a description of
the events ended.

Once at the police station, arrest slips

were filled out for all four youths.

So, I think, that they

were arrested -» at any event, arrested at the police station
when the arrest slips were filled out,

I do not believe

Mr, Conroy thought he was arresting them at the time at the
house, but i don't think it is very important,

I think the

important point there is, notwithstanding what Mr. Flaxman
said, they weren't arresting all four because they thought one
of the four was a Browder,
were.

They knew who the txtfo Browder's

The mother introduced the police officers to the two

Browder's,

It was the other person, the second assailant,

they thought might be there.
■We argue in cur brief that there was probable cause,
like the Seventh Circuit held, and that the warrantless entry
— a warrant was not necessary for the entry because the entry
was consented to,and even if not consented to was acknowledged
by Mrs. Browder.

We also argue that in any event a warrant was

not necessary to enter a private dwelling to effectuate an
arrest, and 1 would like to get back to that a little bit if I
could 0
1 do feel compelled first though to address just
very briefly Mr. Flax-man's initial argument and that was that

28

the Court of Appeals never had jurisdiction to even consider
this case»
There is dispute as to what was the final order, but
right now I don’t want to concede but I am willing to assume
October 21, 1975* was the final order*

That order was a minute

order and a memorandum opinion that was filed after Respondent
filed a motion to dismiss.

The petition was filed, a motion to

dismiss was filed by the Respondent, and then later the District
Court granted the writ and impliedly denied the motion to dis­
miss, although that was never specificalljr stated.

Twenty-

eight days after the writ was issued was a stay of 60 days to
re-try the Petitioner,

The Respondent filed a motion that was

entitled, "Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing'."

It was Respon­

dent's position —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to show

why it took you 28 days to find out what the law was?
MR, McKQSKX:

There is nothing in the record, with

the exception of one statement and the motion for an evidentiary
hearing that said that "upon investigation the Respondent feels
that one may reasonably conclude that there was probable cause,"
It is sort of an innocuous statement but the purpose of the
statement was that the case was an old case —
QUESTION:

Newly discovered evidence?

MR. McKQSKX:
way, Your Honor,

I suppose you could phrase it that

29

QUESTION:

Well, what was the newly discovered

evidence, what the law was?
MRa McRGSKI:

No* Your Honor.

It was not what the

*

law was.
QUESTION:

Well, why wasn't it?

MRo McKOSKI:

The problem that the Respondent faced

was to find out if there were, in fact, facts to present to the
District Court that the arrest —
QUESTION:

And the facts were what you presented,

your witnesses -MRa McKCSKI:
QUESTION:

That were in your control.

MR. McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

Well —

And that's newly discovered evidence.

MR. McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Your Honor —

How can you newly discover your own

evidence?
MR, McKOSKI:

The Respondent in this case, the

Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections nor his
attorney, the Attorney General, had any idea of whether or not
there really were other facts than presented in the record to
establish probable cause.

It had never been litigated.

Didn't they litigate originally?

No

QUESTION:

Well, who represented the State in the

habeas corpus here?
MR. McKOSKI:

The Attorney General of the State of

Illinois,
QUESTION:

That's who I thought represented it.

Well, was he incompetent?
MR. McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

I hope not, Your Honor.

Well, why didn't he put this in then?

MR. McKOSKI:

Because he did not know that those

facts existed.
QUESTION:

Because he didn't know the law.

MR. McKOSKI:

Because he did not know that Sharon

Alexander gave a description to the police officers.
QUESTION:

Because he didn't have the facts.

MR. McKOSKI:

He didn't have the facts that were

never litigated.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the duty of the police officers?

MRo McKOSKI:

Not just merely the final motion to

dismiss.
QUESTION:

Well, do we have to change the rules to

take care of somebody that doesn't know how to try a lawsuit?
MR. McKOSKI:

No, I don't think the rules should be

changed in that regard, Your Honor, but I -QUESTION:

You have no explanation for waiting 28

days to file a motion which should have been filed immediately.

MR. McKQSKI:

I have an explanation., Your Honor.

And I am waiting for it.

The motion to dismiss- is

In this case, no such opportunity was given.

The

QUESTION:

Did the State's lawyer ask for any time?

MR. McKQSKI:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

Well, what are you complaining about

on that point?
MR. McKQSKI:

My first point, Your Honor, is that

the Attorney General, the representative of the Respondent,
needed time to do a factual investigation of a case five years
old o
QUESTION:

You left out one very important point.

The Attorney General's office is very overworked.

I thought so.

MR» McKOSKI:
fact whatsoever

But I certainly do not rely on that

The fact I rely on is that it takes time to

do a factual investigation of a case five years old.

Some of

the police officers are no longer with the force and some
could net even be located tc testify at the hearing»
QUESTION:

But the record was there»

MR» McKOSKI:

The record, unfortunately., did not go

into the circumstances around the arrest because the probable
cause issue wasn't litigated.
QUESTION:

Mr. McKoski, could not the Attorney General,

within the 10 days provided by Rule 59.» have., filed a motion
to amend the order to give him time to conduct the factual
investigation and file an answer?
MR» McKQSKI:
QUESTION:

That could have been done, Your Honor.

And that would have avoided the whole

problem of the timeliness of the appeal, wouldn't it?
MR» McKOSKI:

I don't think

the issue would have

probably still been raised if the Attorney General —
QUESTION:

If he had filed a motion -within the 3.0 days?

The problem with your position, as I understand it, is
that the 10-day requirement just becomes a nullity.

33
MR. McKOSKI:

That’s rights You? Honor»

Our position

is that in habeas cases, number one, the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure do not apply across-the-board„ and it is basically
in the discretion of the trial judge whether to apply them or
not.
QUESTION:

Well, if that’s true, is it significant 1

that the motion was filed in 28 days, rather than, say, 31 or
32 days?
MR. McKOSKI:

Yes, Your Honor, because traditionally

and by practice in the federal courts the motion to reconsider
is timely filed or filed within the 30-day period for appeal»
QUESTION:

That11 s under Rule 60(b), isn’t it?

MR. McKOSKI:

I am talking about, basically,

United States v. Dieter and United States v. Healy®

Those

cases held that a motion to reconsider, traditionally, in
civil and criminal practice, is timely filed or filed within
30 days.
QUESTION:

Your pleading was not filed under Rule

60(b).
MR® McKOSKI;
QUESTION:

No, it was not, Your Honor,

And even today you don’t claim that it

was authorized by Rule 60(b).
MR. McKOSKI:

No, Your Honor.

It was filed under

the rights under the Habeas Corpus Act.
QUESTION:

-don’t you weaken your case by abandoning

all reliance on 60(b)?
MR» McKQSKI:

Your Honor, I am not saying that —

60(b) could be applied here in our favor»

I think it would be

applicable, but we do not make that argument and I cannot say
that we made the argument when we did not*
QUESTION:

I know you didn't»

On the other hand, if

this is jurisdictional, may this Court make it for you?
MR» McKQSKI:

Well, Your Honor, I think if the

Respondent has left out an argument that clearly settles the
issue,that the Court would probably, or should probably, if I
can be so bold, use the argument that the Respondent did not
raise, if, in fact, law and justice required, as the Habeas Corpus
Act requires, these petitions to be disposed in accordance with*

QUESTION;

Or a motion to alter or amend the —

MR» McKQSKI:

Our basic argument is the Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure can be applied by a district judge
when he feels appropriate, when they are in line with disposing
of a petition as law and justice requires.
QUESTION;

That is in a habeas corpus procedure.

MR» MoKGSKI:

Right.

35
QUESTION:

I know your basic argument is that the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not all literally apply*
inexorably apply, to a habeas corpus proceeding.
MR. McKGSKI:

Is that it?

That's correct* You? honor* and that

is supported by the new rules governing habeas procedures and
has always been in effect exercised by the courts.
QUESTION:

And what's the test for knowing whether or

not a particular Rule of Civil Procedure applies in a habeas
corpus petition?

MR. McKGSKI:

It is in the district court's discretion.

If he feels that a rule is applicable* then he can apply that.
And if he does not abuse his discretion* it cannot be disturbed.
It is for him to determine what rules are appropriate to be
applied.
QUESTION:
appealable.

Well* then you never know when anything is

The whole purpose of the Rules of Civil Procedure

is to fix deadlines and let people know when a case Is over*
when It Is timely at rest if no notice of appeal has been filed.
Your system would just leave the whole thing up in
the air* wouldn't it?
MR. McKGSKI:

No* Your Honor* I don't believe so.

When an order was entered that disposed of the case* granted
relief to one party or the other, then that order would be
appealable for a period of up to 30 days.
with that

There is no problem

36
QUESTION:

So then if the Petitioner loses for

failure to present evidence, he could 28 days later come in and
say, "I6ve got evidence."
MR. McKQSKI:

If I understand you correctly, Your

Honor, yes.
OUESTION:

He could?

that another 30 days?

Then could he come in after

When does your time-limit take place?

Surely you agree sometime it!s got to end.
MR. McKQSKI:

Certainly, Your Honor.

When?

MR, McKQSKI:

I think that it would be the same way

that United States y. Dieter or U. S, v, Healy was handled.
One motion to reconsider has been a 11 owed traditionally and by
practice and when you have that one motion, however it 8s
disposed of, you have 30 days from that time ito appeal.

Do you

Would you leave this up to each

MR, McKQSKI:

Honor?
QUESTION:

As to whether or not he is going to ignon

the 10-day rule.
MR. McKOSKX:
OUESTION:

That{s. right, Your Honor.

It would be up to each judge?

37
MR. McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

It would be in their discretion.

Then why not do away with the 10-day rule?

MRo McKOSKI:

I do not think that the 10-day rule

should be applicable to habeas cases because of their nature.
There may be some circumstances where they are.
QUESTION:

What rule would apply?

MR. McKOSKI:

The rule that has been traditionally

followed in practice in civil and criminal cases throughout
the country in federal courts —

You have 30 days to file a

motion to reconsider and 30 days from the date of the disposi­
tion of that motion to appeal.
QUESTION:

So the 10-day rule is out.

MR. McKOSKIs

That!s right, Your Honor.

I think

that —
QUESTION:

Was It Just a mistake?

MR. McKOSKI:

1 don’t think it was a mistake.

I

think it has a place In talking about normal civil suits.
I think also that a district court judge could apply it if he
wanted if he thought it was appropriate.

1 think If he does

not apply it he has that right and only if he abuses his
discretion in not applying it is there a problem.

X think

it’s in the trial court's discretion as other federal rules of

38
civil procedure*

The district judge chose not to apply it

in this case and I think his reasons for not applying it were
sound»

The issue had never been litigated and the state was

making the claim that they had probable cause,
QUESTION:

You wouldn't be making this argument

except that this was a habeas corpus case?
MR. McKCSKI:

Well, there may be other unique kinds

of proceedings that should not be governed all the time by
federal rules»
QUESTION:

Would you say this kind of a petition

would be out of time in a non-habeas corpus civil case?
MR» McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

Of petition to reconsider?

Yes

MR. McKOSKI:

I think still it could be timely filed

in 30 days in a normal civil suit under Dieter and Healy.
QUESTION:

So, you really do say you should just pay

no attention to the rule,
MRe McKOSKI:

I say you should pay no attention to

it in a habeas case if the district court judge —
QUESTION:

I am asking about a non-habeas case.

MR. McKCSKI:

In a non-habeas case, I think the

rules of federal procedure should apply strictly to these
cases.
QUESTION:

So this kind of petition would be out

of time in a regular civil case, a non* habeas corpus caue,

MRo McKQSKI:
QUESTION:

My reading of Healy —*

Isn't there a yes or no to that?

MRo McKGSKI:

I am happy to say that this kind of

motion would be out of time but I think my opinion there might
conflict with Healy*
QUESTION:

What makes you think so?

30 days of the original order»
QUESTION:

Dietar was a criminal case where you don't

have the counterpart of Rule 59«

What case was that* Your Honor?

That case is Bowman v, LaPerino,

No* Your Honor* I have not,

Neither did we.

But the people who wrote

MR, McKOSKI:

I apologize to the Court,

I am not

familiar with the case* Your Honor,
QUESTION:

I thought the argument you were maxing at

the outset was that for all practical purposes a habeas corpus
case is a criminal matter and should be viewed in a criminal
context* just as Congress has viewed it for purposes of the
Criminal Justice Act,

Do you have to go beyond that and try

to give this unlimited discretion to each district judge to
pick time limits of his own* in his own view?
MR, MeKCfcJKX;

No, Your Honor,

There is no question

That's correct,

in the —> It's not just a civil-criminal distinction but

42

it's also the fact that it was a party who had no right in the
district court to get an extension of time for a new trial
other than by an analogy to a petition for rehearing,,
MR» McKOSKI;
QUESTION;

I think that's correct, Your Honor,,

So that, even if you treated this as a

criminal case, you still have your 10-day problem?

It says

here there is a rule squarely in point that says within 10
days the court has power to alter or amend the judgment»
MR» McKOSKI;

I think the basis of -Pieter was that

based on tradition and history, I mean besides tradition and
history that it was the most economical way to adjudicate the
issue»

And I think that same rationale applies here»

To give

a respondent 10 days to move for some kind of relief after his
motion to dismiss has been denied and nothing else has been
stated on the case, X think, provides a burden on him that is
very hard to comply with at any time when you are talking about
habeas cases»
QUESTION:

Well, you say after his motion to dismiss

is denied, but actually the 10-day period contemplates the
motion to be made after a trial also which is a much more
burdensome thing.

You try a six-months case and figure you

have to go in within 10 days and file a motion to alter or
amend the judgment, I think you've got a much bigger problem
than you do in your typical ruling of law type of thing that
you had here, without any evidence taken.

43
MRo McKOSKI:

When you go through a long trial,at

least you know what the facts of the case were»

When our

motion to dismiss was denied here,vie did not know what facts
the police officers had in their possession in a case that
was five years old and we had to literally track doxvn people.
It was not a matter of office work, going through voluminous
records or checking your memory for what happened in the trial»
In a case like you described, Your Honor, at least you know
the facts.

Here, we did not have any idea what the facts

were and had to scout them upc
QUESTION:

How long before had this trial taken

place and these events?
MR. McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

In August of 1971»

And how long was the trial?

MR, McKOSKI:

I believe that it was three days, two

or three days.
QUESTION:

And how long would it take you, as a

lawyer, to go over a three-day record?
MR. McKOSKI:
QUESTION:

Not very long, Your Honor, but -~

It would be less than 10 days, wouldn't it?

It would be less than 10 wouldn't it?
MR. McKOSKI:

Yes, Your Honor.

The problem is that

the record included absolutely nothing on the probable cause
issue and we had to go outside the record to locate witnesses
around the City of Chicago.

44
I would also like to mention* too* in passing* on
this* that if the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do apply
then the rules were violated by the district court by ruling
on the merits of the case with only our motion to dismiss
pending.

Certainly* in any other kind of civil case where the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply* the case cannot be
decided on the merits with only a motion to dismiss pending.
He did not consider it as a motion for summary judgment.
The Petitioner did not file a motion for summary judgment.
The only thing that we had pending was a motion to dismiss
where we admitted everything the Petitioner said and said he
did not state a claim.

We had a right to a hearing if our

motion to dismiss was denied. . The trial judge did not give
us chat in compliance with the rules.

He did not give us a

chance to answer* whatever the provision is* 10 or 15 or 20
days to file an answer.
QUESTION:

We got no —

Isn't this ordinarily raised by appeal?

MR. McKOSKX:

That's right* Your Honor.

To raise

that by appeal, though, would just expand the litigation over
years.

We would have gone up to the Seventh Circuit to ask

for a hearing and they would have given us a hearing, hopefully.
And we would have gone back down to district court.

The dis­

trict court -would have found no probable cause and we would
have been back up to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

They

would have found probable cause, if they stuck to their original

45
decision* and it would have taken a couple more years0

It

certainly saves a lot of time and I think that was part of the
reason In Dieter to ask right there in the district court for
the hearing and avoid one appeal,.
We would like to speak briefly* if I may* concerning
the Stone v„ Powell issue and the Walnwrlght v0 Sykes issue»
It is our contention* basically* that the search and seizure
issue* the Fourth Amendment claim, is not cognizable In a
habeas case.

And even if it is cognizable the Petitioner has*

In effect, waived his right to present that issue in a federal
habeas corpus petition because he did not object to the entry
of the evidence in the trial court on the basis of unlawful
arrest„
Stone Vo Powell requires an opportunity

the state

give an opportunity for Petitioner to raise a Fourth Amendment
claim.

The State of Illinois provides such a procedure.

A

motion to suppress evidence can be made before trials so the
facts were not known at trial.

This opportunity* provided for

in Illinois statutes* safeguards the deterrent effect of the
exclusionary rule* which was the main concern in Stone v„
Powello

Simply put* as long as the police know that illegally

seised evidence can be suppressed or will be suppressed by a
state court* there is no Incentive for them to disregard the
Fourth Amendment.

In fact* there is a deterrent, because

illegally seized evidence Mil not be allowed.

46
The fact that the defendant in the trial court and
the Petitioner here did not choose to challenge the evidence
in the state court doesn't detract from the effectiveness of
the Illinois procedures in deterring police conduct.

It would

only have an effect on the deterrence if we could assume that
a police officer would think, ‘Veli, I can seize this evidence
illegally because the defendant's attorney probably won't raise
the issueo "

I don’t think that can be a Valid assuurpSTon,

The state did nothing to interfere with the opportunity
Petitioner had in state court to present his issue.

There

was an opportunity — defendant did not take advantage of the
opportunity but it was there -- and, therefore, this purely•
Fourth Amendment claim is not' cognizable.

If it ie ■cognizable

defendant did not raise the issue in a trial court.
raise the arrest issue on a motion to suppress.

He did not

He did raise

the arrest issue at trial, using it to show that the police
officers really didn't know who they were arresting, that
there was no warrant, there 'were four arrested, investigation
of rape, using it to show the jury that the police weren't sur€.'
who committed the crime and therefore the jury should not be
*

sure who committed the crime.
Petitioner's trial counsel knew the factual basis
for an arrest claim.

He filed motions under the contemporaneous

objection rule, so he was aware of that.

In fact, his efforts

helped secure the Petitioner's acquittal on the armed robbery

47
charge? although he was convicted of rape»

There is nc

challenge that he was competent? simply the Petitioner has not
^

shown cause why his failure to object in the trial court should
be excused,,

Also .important here is the reliability of the
evidence.

The district court and trial court

The confession was purely voluntarjr? as a volun­

teered statement.after two eyewitnesses identified the
defendant in a lineup.

He admitted to one and denied the other?

called the police officers over to speak to him? no interroga)

tion whatsoever.

Each statement was only a couple minutes long.

Miranda warnings were given three times.
In short? it is our position the issue is not
cognizable.

Secondly, Vfainwright v„ Sykes? application of

that rule only leads to one result that he waived the Issue
because there is no cause and there was no prejudice from the
alleged constitutional violation.
Thank you? very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further? Mr. Flaxman?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF Op THE PETITIONER
MR. FLAXMAN:
please the Court:

Yes? Mr. Chief Justice? and may it

48
QUESTION:

Mr. Flaxman, before you commence* if you

should prevail on the jurisdictional issue, do you think we
must reach the Rule 35 insue, that you also raised?
MRo FLAXMAN:
Ito

No, I don't think the Court must reach

Mr. Browder would be happy with reinstatement of the

writ granted by the district court.
The primary argument that I have been listening to
is that the State or the Director didn't have time to get
together its motion to reconsider within 28 days.

The motion

that was filed in opposition to the petition was not really a
motion to dismiss.

It was a motion for summary judgment.

It

was based on facts set out in the State court record that were
before the district judge and it relied on those facts.

In our

memorandum filed in support of the petition, we suggested that
It would not be inappropriate if the district judge said it was
all right to allow an evidentiary hearing for the Director to
show that there was probable cause for this arrest.

If the

Director had come in within 10 days and said, "Judge, you
didn't hold an evidentiary" hearing.

You should have held one,

even the Petitioner thinks you should have held one," wc;
probably would have been estopped to dispute that and the
hearing would have been held.

Rather than come In within 10

days, there was this 28-day delay.
QUESTION:

The motion, instead of being denominated

and a motion to alter or amend had been denominated, a motion

49
for a new trial on the tests of newly discovered evidence,
under Rule 60, in the same time sequence had obtained*
1

MR. FLAXMAN:

If it had been — Regardless of how it

— If the district judge construed it as a Rule 59 motion, it
would have told the time to appeal*

If it had been a Rule 60(b)

motion which could be filed any time after the notice of appeal
should have been filed, without telling the time to appeal,
then there would be — the standards for review of the denial
of that motion would be whether the district judge had abused
his discretion in refusing to modify his earlier order.

There

is no abuse of discretion here, but evidence before the
I

district judge at the hearing for a motion to reconsider was
contradictory.
QUESTION:

But at least there the Court of Appeals

would have had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
MR . FLAXMAN:

That's correct.

That's exactly what

we argued in the Court of Appeals, that this motion should be
this appeal should be viewed as an appeal from the denial of
Rule 6o(b) relief.

The Director conceded, or represented and

urged the Court of Appeals not to view it as a Rule 6o(b)
|

appeal and has urged this Court not to do so0

I think it would

be inappropriate for this Court to go back and reconstrue the
ease if it had been an appeal for denial of Rule 6o{b) relief.
Even if it had been, though, the result necessarily would have
been that the district judge should have been affirmed because

50

there were ample contradictions to support his refusal to
modify his earlier order»
The argument that Rule 59 does not apply to habeas
corpus proceedings overlooks what I_ think Mr» Justice Relinquish
was getting at in his question as to how do we tell which set
of rules apply»

We can tell that when it is not explicitly

said by looking at former practice and seeing if former
practice in similar eases conforms to practice in habeas corpus
cases3 and indeed it did, as we make clear in the two cases
that we cite in our brief, in a footnote at page 21»
