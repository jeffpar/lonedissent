MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76“911> Adamo Wrecking Company against United States.
Mr» Lipnick, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M» LIPNICK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIPNICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a criminal case arising under the Clean
Air Act as it stood prior to the amendment this past summer.
Section 112(b) of the Act, as it then stood, instructed the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to
promulgate an emission standard for controlling emissions of
hazardous air pollutants, one. of which is asbestos.
The Administrator issued a work practice regulation
for demolition operations and gave it the title "emission
standard."

Section 112(c) of the Act prohibits a violation

of an emission standard.
My client is accuser by indictment of violating
Section 112(c) of the Act foi an alleged failure to follow
the Environmental Protection Agency's work practice rule.
In the trial court,we challenged the indictment on
the ground that a violation cf an emission standard is an
essential element of the crime and that a work practice rule
is not the same thing as an emission standard, notwithstanding

4
its titleo
The trial court agreed and dismissed the first count
of a two-count indictment, which is the only count now before
this Court,
reversed.

The Government appealed and the Sixth Circuit
The Sixth Circuit held that our position amounted

to a challenge to the validity of the regulation itself,
QUESTION:

VJhat is left of your issue after the

amendment this summer?
MRc LIPNICK s

Well, one thing that is left is

whether my client has to go to trial and possibly be convicted
of a felony,
QUESTION:
btatute,

The issue is in the meaning of that

ion51 it?
MR. LIPNICK:

The issue —• The first issue, as I

understand it, sir, is the meaning of Section 307(h)(2) of
the Act which, by its language, says "there shall be no
judicial review in a civil or criminal proceeding for
enforcement of action which could have been reviewed under
the statutory review procedure,"
I think one issue which is still open for decision
by :his Court is whether that statute, that preclusion pro­
vision, is in fact an absolute preclusion of all judicial
V

consideration of the propriety of actions by the administrator,
even actions which, on their face, are alleged to be in
violation of his duties under the Act,

5
QUESTION:

If it is an absolute preclusion,do. you

make any claim in this case, or have you., that that kind of a
preclusion, purported conclusion, would be unconstitutional?
MR* LIPNICK:

I think that's a question of fact

which would have to be developed at trial, sir.

I think it

would depend on whether we were able to chow at trial whether
we *"«
QUESTION:

But have you raised any constitutional

issue about —
MRo LIPNICK;

Not by our.motion to dismiss, sir„

1 think »»

QUESTIvN:

And you haven't pressed any constitutional

issue here?
MR, LIPNICK:

No, sir, except for the fact that I do

believe that there is a question of adequacy and effectiveness
of the statutory remedy which could invoke the constitutional
question and which would require development in litigation of
an issue of feet in the trial court*
The preclusion section, as I indicated, says there
is to be no judicial review at enforcement proceedings of
regulations which could be reviewed under the statutory
review procedure.

The review procedure is not now available

to my client, and could have been initiated only by filing a
petition for review within 30 days of the date on which the
regulation was issued,

6
The Court of Appeals, in our view, ignored the
language of Section 112(c) itself, which prohibits violation
of an emission standard and which does not prohibit a viola­
tion of any regulation which the Administrator might issue
concerning asbestos»

From that perspective, we are not pre­

pared to concede that the trial court was even reviewing the
regulation within the meaning of the preclusive provision,
as opposed to simply looking at the face of the regulation
to ascertain whether it was in fact the type of regulation
specified in the criminal prohibition»
However, if that should be considered judicial
review, we believe that it is review which is within the
sphere of this Court's decisions which permit a limited type
of review even in circumstances when rev lev; of Agency action is
ordinarily unavailable.

We traced that, starting with this

Court's decision in Leedom v, Kyne, in which this Court
indicated that statutory review provisions normally contem­
plate review of Agency action which is.,, at least on its face,
within the scope of Agency authority, and therefore permitted
an inquiry into the question of whether the Agency in that
case had complied with specific statutory instruction.
subsequently, in a case cited by the Government in
its br1ef, Brotherhood of Railway Clerks_v„ Monoontract
■Employees, this Court again said that nonstatutory review is
available to assure that Agency action does not exceed the

7
statutory authority and that action which is ordinarily'nonrev iewable is, in fact, reviewable to the extent of ascertain­
ing that the Agency performed its
statutory duty. And in the
j
l
Brotherhood of Railway Clerks case, this Court, as I read the
decision, entered holdings on the merits on those limited
Issues,

of whether the.Agency action was within the scope

of its authority and whether it, at least on its face, pur­
ported to comply with the Agency's statutory duty*
holdings were not jurisdictional, as I read them.

Those
They were

holdings on the merits.
La.st year., in the Therm.tron Products case, concerning
the removal procedures from state to federal courts and the
remand procedures back, this Court held that the statutory
preclusion of review of a remand order which, on its face,
purported fee be absolute, still permitted judicial review in
the limited sense of ascertaining whether a trial court order
of remand was at least based upon one of the grounds for
remand specified in the statute.
This past June the two Voting Act cases which are
cited in the Government*s brief, I believe continue to
recognize this principle of the availability of limited
review.

In Briscoe v. Bell, the Court avoided holding that

coverage determinations by the Attorney General and by- the
director of Census were not open to judicial inquiry at least
to ascertain whether there was reliance by those officials

8
upon the criteria specified in the statute for making those
determinations.

And on the same day in Norris v. Gressetts

the majority opinion of this Court noted that Congress, like
the Court, operates on the assumption that public officials
will perform their duty, and indicates that line of inquiry
harkens back to heedom v. Kyns and to RaiIway Clerks, which
indicates to me a line of authority of this Court which is
very sound, In ray view, and very persuasive,that legislation
governing the scope of review of agency actions simply does
not contemplate agency action which is lawless, that even
where the review provisions say review is unavailable there
can be at least an inquiry to ascertain whether an agency
took action which, on its face, complied with what a statute
told the agency to do,
QUi&TION:

Of course, this statute didn't say

review was unavailable.

It said it just had to be taken within

a certain time, didn't it?
MR. LIPNICK:

Well, in our position now it's un­

available,
QUESTION;

Well, X suppose you could say that about

the statute of limitations or laches, too; if you let the
thing go long enough, it is unavailable.

That doesn't mean

that the statute of limitations is ignored.
MR. LIPNICK:

No.

I don't think there is really,

from the context of this case ~~ Your Honor, I don't think

9
there is really a difference between saying you canct review
it unless you seek review within 30 days of the time when it's
issued or saying you can't review it at all*
question still is:

I think the

If Congress passes a lav; which says you

must seek review within 30 days or not at all, do they con­
template by the term "review," or by that provision, do they
contemplate foreclosing the federal judiciary from any juris­
diction to inquire into the question of whether an administra­
tive agency has committed an act which, on its face, is un­
lawful?
QUESTION:

Even though the attack on the adminis­

trative action comes two or three years after the promulgation
of the regulation?
MR* LIPNXCK:
inquiry is always open*

Yes, sir.

I think that limited

I think it is always open for us

to say that we are being prosecuted for conduct which Congress
did not make a crime*

Congress said you can't violate an

emission standard, and if we can't raise the question of
whether or not this regulation is an emission standard, I
think we are in the position of having the bjbcth Circuit
decision stand, which holds that we can be brought to trial and
convicted for conduct which Congress did not make a crime*
I think we are in the position, if the «sixth Circuit's decision
stands ~~ 1 think we are in the position of having a rule
-which says that even though this Agency was at the time in

10

violation of its own continuing mandatory duty to promulgate
the kind' of regulation Congress told them to promulgate* an
emission standard* nonetheless the federal courts are going
to enforce that violation of law by the Agency.

And they are

going to do it by convicting my client of conduct which was
not made a crime by Congress.

We think that's wrong.

And I

don't think it matters whether our attack upon the Agency's
'action as being lawless on its face comes two years or twenty
years after the regulation is promulgated.
QUESTION:

Did the Agency think this vjas an emission

standard?
MR. LIPNXCK:
emission standard.

The Agency gave it the title of

I think the Agency's position has not been

entirely consistent as to whether it is or is not an emission
standard* and I am not certain that the Agency has ever really
squarely addressed that particular question,

I think the

Agency has* as I understand them —
QUESTION:
a chance,

Well* you didn't g.ive them too much of

I mean you could have gone to the Agency,
MR, LIPNXCK:

We have gone to the Agency in other

proo eedings. sir.
QUESTION:

But not this one,

MR, LIPNXCK:
QUESTION:

Not this one.

No* sir.

In other proceedings* has the Agency said

it was an emission standard?

MR. LIPNXCK:

No, sir.

The Agency has always taken

the position that we are questioning the validity of the
regulation, that we are questioning its authority to issue
the regulation and that the regulation is authorized.

I don't

think they have ever, to my knowledge, focused on the question
simply of whether cr not ltes an emission standard.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there ..at

1:00 o'clock.
(VJhereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court recessed, to
reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same day.)

12
AFTERNOON SESSION
(l:Ol p.m.}
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may proceed,

Mr. Lipniek,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. LIPNICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIPNICK;

(Resumed)

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Before the luncheon break, if I recall, I was asked
whether the Agency had ever itself considered the question of
whether the work practice rule is an emission standard, and
I think I would like to expand upon my answer, just briefly,
If I may.
I think the Agency has always known the work practice
rule is not an emission standard.

On December 7, 1971* when

it first published its proposed regulation in the Federal
Register, the following statement appears in the preamble to
the proposed regulation at Volume 36, page 23239 of the
Federal Register, quote;

“Because there is no suitable

technique for sampling and analyzing asbestos in the ambient
air or :Ln emission gases, the standards are expressed as
requirements for the operation of specific control equipment
or other equipment of comparable effectiveness or in situations
where no control system is available as prohibitions on the
use of asbestos.

When acceptable source sampling and

13

analytical methods are available and it is possible to
delineate hazardous levels, these standards may be revised
to require compliance with a measured allowable emission.
On April 6, 1973* when the work practice regulation
was first promulgated in final form, in the preamble1 to that
publication, at Volume 38, page 8820 of the Federal Register,
the Agency stated, quote:

"It is not practicable at this

time to establish allowable numerical concentrations or
mass emission limits for asbestos.!!
And then in the third column of the same page:
"The means of control used are limitations on visible emissions
with an option in some cases to use designated control equip­
ment, requirements that certain procedures be followed and
prohibition on the use of certain materials or of certain
operations.

These means of control are required because of

the impossibility at this time of prescribing and enforcing
allowable numerical concentrations or mass emission limita­
tions known to provide an ample margin of safety."

QUESTION:
filed here?

Foes that appear in anything you. have

What you have just read.

MR. LIPN1CK:

I am certain that the final publica­

tion is cited in the brief.

I am also certain that the

quotation is not, sir.
QUESTION:

The quotation —

MR e LIPNICK:

I am certain that the Federal Register

14

publication — This is the final regulation as published»
1 think the only other thing I need to say. if the
Court please* is that the only inquiry which is necessary here
to ascertain that the Administrator did not comply with
«lection 112(b) of the Act is whether or not the regulation*
on its face* is ah emission standard ,

And the result of that

inquiry shows that my client is* indeed* being prosecuted for
something Congress did not make criminal and we believe that
that is simply wrong and that it should be reversed.
The portion of the Federal Register at which the
final regulation is promulgated* Mr. Chief Justice* is cited
at page 5 of our brief* and the regulation Itself is quoted.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Easterbrook.
ORAL ARGUMENT CP FRANK. H. EASTERBRQCK, ESQ.*
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR. EASTERBROOK;

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it

please the Court:
The central statutory provision at issue here is
Section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act Amendment.

That section

provides that the District of Columbia Circuit has exclusive
jurisdiction to any challenge of the action of the Administra­
tor of the EPA in promulgating any emission standard* and
that review may be had in that court on any petition filed

15

within 30 days of the promulgation or thereafter if new
grounds arise after the 30th day.
Section 307(h)(2) provides, and I quote:

"Action

of the Administrator with respect to which review could have
been obtained under the first paragraph shall not be subject
to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for
enforcement."

That statute is abundantly clear.

The challenge Petitioner now raises to the validity
of the emission standard promulgated by the Administrator —
QUESTION:

Just so I've got it clear, is there

any restriction on what issues could be raised In the Court
of Appeals for the .District of Columbia?
MR. EASTEKBRQOK:

There is none. Your Honor.

The

District —
QUESTION:

Whether you've gone to the Administrator

with them or not?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Well, the District of Columbia

Circuit requires that the claims have been raised.

The

statutory claim «»
QUESTION:

But if you haven't presented a particula

claim to the Agency, the court won't hear it?
MR. EASTERBROCK:

There are sometimes problems of

exhaustion of administrative remedies. Your Honor, that would
go with claims of this sort,

If it were a claim being raised

for the first time in the JPis trict of Columbia Circuit that

16

the Administrator had never had a chance to consider, it might
be appropriate not to consider it, or it might be appropriate
under District of Columbia Circuit practice.
QUESTION:

What would you think about a coverage

question?
MR. CASTE KB ROOK:
QUESTION:

A pure attack on the face ■—

Well, just say that the regulation just

simply isn’t authorized by the statute.

That must have been

presented to the Administrator before the court will hear
it?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:
true

No, Your Honor, I think the

coverage case could be raised at any time in the D.C. —*

not at any time, but it could be raised in fcheD.C. Circuit.
QUESTION:

And without ever having been presented

to the Administrator?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What about a constitutional challenge to

the underlying statute?
MR, EASTERBRQOK:

The result of that would be the

same, since the Administrator lacks the authority to declare
the underlying statute unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

And what about the constitutionality of

the regulation?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

I think that would depend in part

on the nature of the challenge to the regulation.

If the natur

17

of the challenge were such that a regulation easily could have
been drafted consistent with the Protestant’s view of consti­
tutionality, that that kind of claim should be presented first
to the Administrator so that he would have a chance to draft
a regulation that in the view of the challenger is constitu­
tional.

••

i' " ■

Xf there were a constitutional- claim in this case,
that rationale would not apply because the Administrator has
already considered whether it is practicable to promulgate
a regulation in some other form.
tor’s judgment on that.

And we have the Administra*,

There would be no point in asking for

his judgment again.
QUESTION:

How do you work all that into the 30-

day time limit? The administrative exhaustion.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The 30-day time limit -commences

to run, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, only after the final promulga­
tion of the regulation.

These regulations are promulgated

after notice and comment rule-making.

In this case, the

initial notice and publication came in 1971 and there was a
process of more than a year before the final promulgation.
The 30 days commence to run only after the final promulgation
of the regulation.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Well, supposing a person gets a

copy of the notice or advice of it, doesn’t do anything then
and the regulation becomes final.

And then he seeks to

3.8
challenge it in the Court of Appeal® of the District of
Columbia Circuit within 30 days*

Is he then barred because

he didn't challenge it before the Agency?
MR© EASTERBRQCK:

If he not only did not challenge

it before the Agency, but no one challenged it before the
Agency, on those grounds, then consistent with the rationale
that I gave in answer to Mr, Justice White's question, I think
he would then be barred in the D.O* Circuit.
The statute itself, as I have said, is quite clear.
And the contention that Petitioner now raises is one that he
could have raised in the District of Columbia Circuit under fchv
answer that I gave to Mr. Justice White,

Indeed, Petitioner

conceded in the District Court, a concession that appears at
page 85 of the Court of Appeals Appendix, that he could have
raised in the District of Columbia Circuit the contentions he
now raises*

Because the challenge could have been raised in

that court —
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, may I stop you there?

Could he have raised this on the theory that it was an emission
standard under Section 112, within the meaning of 307(b)(1)?
MR. EASTERBRQCK:

I am sorry, Your Honor, I don't

understand your ques tion *
QUESTION:

'Well, the plain language of the statute

controlled. (b)’(2) says that you are barred unless you file
the petition for review as authorized by (b)(1).

(b)(1)

19
authorized the petition for review of the action of the
Administrator in promulgating any emission standard.

to for us to conclude that he should have followed
that procedure, need we not decide that it was an emission
standard?
MR. EASTfRBROOK:

I believe not, Your Honor.

And X can answer that in several respects.

Section

(b)(2) says that review is barred on any question that could
have been reviewed under (b)(1).
QUESTION:

Correct.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

So, in order for Petitioner to

prevail here, you would have to first conclude that his
contentions are ones that the District of Columbia Circuit
could not have considered on a petition being filed under
(b)(1).
QUESTION:

Correct.

MR. EASTERBRQQK:

The District of Columbia Circuit

has held in the Oljato case, which is cited in the footnote,
at page 15 of our brief, that it may consider challenges
similar to the challenge at issue here, that is, contention
that the regulation was on its face not the kind of thing
that the statute authorized.

Under that rationale, this was

a challenge, review of which could have been had in the D.C.
Circuit, and of which review therefore may not be had now
under (b)(2).

20

I can set out a .couple of reasons for that.

The

argument that you can now review in a criminal proceeding,
the contention that there is no emission standard would
essentially make the question of jurisdiction turn on the
merit,

That is* under Petitioner's view, review would be

precluded only after the District Court had already given the
regulation full review,
QUESTION:

Yes, but under your view, if the

Administrator promulgates something called an emission
standard and the text of it is that every wrecker shall pay
$500 a month into a conservation fund, he is bound to go to
the Court of Appeals, no matter how far away from the legis-»
lative intent that was,
MR, iiASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice Relinquist, I don’t

think that we need to make an argument that extreme in order
to prevail here,
Let me suggest the two kinds of inquiry that I think
the District Court should ask.

The first kind of inquiry is

whether the Administrator's regulation purports to rely on
Section 112, that is whether he says that this is an emission
standard.
The second kind of question the District Court might
ask, and properly so, is whether the Administrator's regulation
purports ti: control the emission of the hazardous substance,
since Section 112 is a section dealing with release of

21

hazardous substances Into the air*
The District Court, if it answers those questions
affirmatively, that is, if it says the Administrator says he
relied on Section 112 and this regulation, in fact, controls
the emission of hazardous substances into the air, should
conclude its inquiry at that point*

There are, of course,

a myriad of ways in which the Administrator might go about
controlling those kinds of emissions»

The question whether

he has controlled emissions in the very way that the statute
contemplates is, we think, exactly the kind of question
Congress had in mind when it required review of that thing to
come in the District of Columbia Circuit»
QUESTION:

But even if the District Court asks those

questions and answers them now, this isn't the kind of a —
he doesn't even purport to be acting under this section.

That

question still could have been raised in the Court of Appeals,
under your argument.
MR. BASTERBROQK:

When 1 answered Mr, Justice

Rehnquist by saying that we did not have to go as far as his
hypothetical, I did not mean to say that we think it would be
inappropriate for the District of Columbia Circuit to review
it.

Ultimately *»«
QUESTION:

So there are then some questions that can

be raised later, despite Section (2)?
MR. EASTERBRC OK:

I think — No.

The suggestion

22
that I made to Mr, Justice Rehnqui-st was, I think, the same
kind of question that the District of Columbia Circuit would
ask itself when someone filed a petition for review in the
District of Columbia Circuit, that is to say before that
court could exercise its statutory review authority it would
have to decide whether the claim that was being made before it
was a challenge -QUESTION:

If it is wrong enough, we won't review

it o
MR, EASTERBRQQK:

Not if it's wrong enough, but if

it is not —
QUESTION:

If it rS —

MR* EASTERBROOK:

— not even.purported to be

promulgated under this section.
QUESTION:

So, we will just let it stand, the

District of Columbia Circuit would say?
MR» EASTERBROOK:

The District of Columbia Cireuit's

answer, I think, would be that this would be something for an
original action in the District Court,
Similar problems were before this Court last year
in the three Dupont cases, involving the question whether the
Court of Appeals or the District Court would have review of
certain regulations promulgated by the Administrator,

Before

you could decide that question, you had to decide what kind
of regulations they were*

23

1 think the District of Columbia Circuit must ask
the same kind of question when someone files a petition for
review with it.

It says this is a regulation promulgated by

the Administrator»

Is it the kind of thing described in

Section 307(h)(1)?

If so, it will review it there.

If not,

it must dismiss the petition for review.
And the two criteria that I gave in answer to
Mr. Justice Rehnquist are, I believe, the criteria that that
court should ask,

I think,if you asic those questions here,

the regulation satisfies those criteria and, therefore, was
one that could have been reviewed in the District of Columbia
Circuit.
Let me go back if I can, briefly, to discuss the
legislative history of Section 307(b), because I believe it
sheds considerable light on the kinds of things that must be
reviewed in the District of Columbia Circuit.

Section 307(b)

- \

originated In the Senate which adopted the limitation on
judicial review as an alternative, according to the Senate
report at page 41, to an absolute preclusion.

The reason why

it was considering something as extreme as an absolute pre­
clusion of judicial review was that it wanted, end I quote:
"to maintain the integrity of the tine sequences provided
throughout the Act ,15
Each of the steps in promulgation of regulations

24
and review of regulations is a precondition to something else*
In this case., a precondition to compliance.

But one of the

necessities of compliance is to have a valid regulation.
And so Congress centralized review in a single forum, the
District of Columbia Circuit* with a very short time 1 imita tion for review in order to achieve fcx^o important objectives.
The first of those objectives was to make sure that any
review would produce uniform results across the nation.

All

competitors in the industry would be subjected to the

same standards* rather than different standards that might be
imposed by different judges*
And second, it wanted to be sure that if, in fact,
the regulation was invalid, the invalidity would be detected
quickly so that the Administrator could then promulgate a
new and valid regulation.

That required a time limitation on

jud ic ia 1 rev i ew.
Congress set out to give the regulations, after
the period for review had expired, the same unquestioned
authority as the statute itself.

Section 307 accomplished

that end, and the position of Petitioner which amounts to
saying that the regulations are always open to challenge,
would frustrate that end.
We understand Petitioner to make three kinds of
arguments.

First, Petitioner argues that any regulation may

be attacked on its face at any time.

Second

and this is a

variation of the first argument that I have already discussed
in part — Petitioner contends that Section 307(h) applies
only to regulations that are in fact and in law emission
standards,
The third contention,which Petitioner makes only
implicitly but which the District Court made more clearly,
is that section 307 applies only to attack on the procedure
by which the regulation was promulgated and not the conten- ■
tions that the substance of the regulation is unauthorized bystatute 0
None of these arguments is correct, and I will take
then up in turn.

The first argument that regulations may be

attacked on their face at any time in inconsistent with the
progeny of the Yakus case,

In the wake of Yakus,which upheld

against constitutional attack,a statute very similar to
Section 307(b)

-t

this Court applied that rule of preclusion .

in a number of cases, attacking regulations as inconsistent
on their face with the statute authorizing the promulgation
of price regulations.

These cases are collected at page 24 of

our brief.
If there were any reason to distinguish between
attacks on the face of the regulation and attacks on the
regulation as applied

and Section 307 makes no such

distinction — it would be more appropriate to bar facial
attacks.

After all, facial defects are known the instant a

26

regulation is promulgated, whereas attacks on the regulation
as applied in particular cases may not come to rise until
later.

And, therefore, it may be difficult to protest within

30 days things that are unknown at the time of the promulga­
tion.
Petitioner contends, however, that Leedom v« Kyne
supports the position that a person always may challenge a
regulation as facially inconsistent with the authorizing
statute.

But this Court has pointed out in later cases,

most recently last June in Briscoe V, Bell, Footnote 13, that
-Leedom did net establish that principle.

Leedom was a case in

which judicial review was conditioned on a final order by the
National labor Relations Board.

It was necessary to construe

that ambiguous term in order to determine when review was
appropriate.

If in Leedom, that term had not been construed

to make review available, it might never have been available.
But those problems don't arise here.
QUESTION:

Didn’t Leedom involve a certification of

a bargaining unit?
MR, EASTERBRQQK:
QUESTION:

Of a bargaining unit,

And isn’t review always available on an

a(5) violation for refusal to bargain?
MR,.BASTERBROOK:

It would be available only if

the employer then refused to bargain.
QUESTION:

Right,

And that’s the normal way in

2?

which it is revlewable.

It is rev leviable thousands of times

a year by the Board, isn't it?
MR. KA3TERBR00K:

Yes, it is,

But in Leeclom the

question was inclusion of particular employees in the
bargaining unit.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. EASTERBROGK:

And the employer and the employee,

the employer and the union were then going to bargain.

There

never would have been any 8(a)(5) violation in Leedom.

The

SCa)C5) violation can come about only if the employer refuses
to bargain.
PUEoTICN:

Refuses to bargain and he can refuse to

bargain because he says this is' not the appropriate bargaining
unit.
MR. SA3TERBROOK:
going to happen in Leedom.
QUESTION:

That's right, but that wasn't
The people —

It couldn't happen because Leedom said

that an appeal was allowable before it happened,
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

But, ray point, Mr. Just let Stewart,

was that there was going to be no review in Leedom because the
employer had already said that he was willing to bargain,

so

it was a case in which there could be no effective review at
all.

That was the need to resolve the ambiguity.
Later cases, such as Brotherhood of ■'Railway Trainmen,

have construed Leedom rather narrowly.

And, in any event,

28

Leedom did not involve a review preclusion statute, like
Section 307, nor did it involve what 307 involves.
a complete preclusion of review.

It is not

It is a statute requiring

contentions to be made in a particular court at a particular
time.

It does not bar Adamo from challenging the regulation.

It simply
QUESTION:

If there is any practical — You mentioned

the word "practical" a couple of sentences ago — If you take
a wrecker out 2,000 miles sway from Washington who doesn't
read the Federal Register, and so forth, and has a very small
business, this kind of a statute really practically bars him
from challenge, doesn't it?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
Honor.

I don't think that is so. Your

There are a number of means that small contractors

have to address these kinds of problems.

One is to form a

trade association, which the National Association of Demolition
Contractors is, which acts effectively as the agent of all of
the small demolition contractors for reading the Federal
Register and advising them of their interests, and in some
cases including a subsequent challenge to the regulations at
Issue here, the National Association of Demolition Contractors
has filed a petition for judicial review, acting to protect
the interests of its members.

That kind of collective action

is always available to small contractors.
But the second answer is that I think that it is

29

appropriate for Congress to require small contractors to
read the Federal Register,

When contractors are dealing, as

they are here, with a material like asbestos which is one of
the most potent cancer-causing agents known, it is not un­
reasonable for Congress to pass a statute which tells those
who may cause the deaths of innocent people to read the
Federal Register to protect their interests.
QUESTION:

X may agree with that, and perhaps all

the Court may agree with that, but X think you should delete
the word "practical" then from your argument, because as a
practical matter many, many small businessmen would be pre­
cluded from reviewing this sort of thing.
MR, iiASTFRBROOK:

1 didn't want to imply that all

of them would read the Federal Register, and X retract that
kind of suggestion.
The second argument,which vie have discussed briefly
already, is that Section 307 applies only to emission standards
and that therefore you have to decide first whether something
is an emission standard in order to know whether review is
precluded in the District Court,
I think the answer to that, as X said to you earlier,
Mr. Justice Stevens, is that that makes jurisdiction turn on
the merits, and it makes it turn on the merits in a way that
would make «Section 307(h) completely ineffective,
one of the. things that can be done to challenge

30

regulations of this sort is to contend that they are not only
not emission standards-, but they are not emission standards
because they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of dis­
cretion and the like*
It is clear that Congress did not authorize the
Administrator of the EPA to be arbitrary or to be capricious
or to abuse his discretion, or to do something that on its
face is unreasonable.
All of those things are reasons why the Administrator
has acted unlawfully, and therefore lias not promulgated the
kind of emission standard that the statute contemplated*
But if those kinds of contentions are open, then Section 307
(b) means nothing, because those are surely at the core of
what Congress intended to preclude, as I think are contentions
that rather than regulating emissions of asbestos in one. way,
by requiring it to be wetted, it should have regulated
emissions of asbestos in some other way, that is by setting
numerical standards.
All of those attacks on how the Administrator ought
to go about the business of regulating asbestos emission are
the kinds of things that Congress intended to be reviewed in
the District of Columbia Circuit, and that therefore cannot
be reviewed now„
QUESTION:

Mr* Eaaterbrook. there is a rather clear

d j,fi e rene e between what the statute says, in the category you

31
describe "arbitrary and capricious and the like.," it is quite
clear that the statute purports to preclude review because
you are dealing with an emission standard, albeit one that
is arbitrary and erroneous*

But if your question is whether

or not it is an emission standard — It is true you have to
decide the merit to decide the jurisdictional issue, but I am
not sure that's an answer*
MR* EASTERBROCK:

In part, I think, we may have

become engaged in a semantic exercise.

My point, and perhaps

an excessively semantic one, was that it is always possible to
say that because the regulation was arbitrary and capricious
it was not the kind of emission standard that Congress con­
templated at all.
Ultimately, what Petitioner is arguing is that what
the Administrator did is net the kind of emission standard
Congress contemplated.

Petitioner agrees, I believe, that

Congress intended the Administrator to regulate asbestos and
to control the amount of asbestos that could come off into
the air.

What this dispute is about is how best the

Administrator should do that, and whether Congress authorized
him to do it in a particular way.
And, although you can, ijt is true, always phrase
that question as to whether there is any emission standard
at all, it is equally reasonable to phrase it as the question
whether the emission standard that the Administrator promulgated

32
was the kind of thing that Congress had in mind.
i

QUESTION:

Would any of your arguments be any

different^ Mr. Easterbrook, if the time period was 10 days?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Those kinds of arguments would

go, Mr. Chief Justice, to whether the procedures for review
established an adequate forum in which it could be reviewed.
We understand Petitioner's answer to Mr. Justice
White.

He is not contending that the opportunity for review

was, in fact, inadequate.

Petitioner said that he is going

to reserve these for disposition at the trial.

We believe that

they cannot be so reserved under Rule 12(b) of the Rules of
Criminal Procedure.

But in any event, Petitioner is not

making any argument that the opportunity for review in the
District of Columbia Circuit was inadequate.

And I think the

10-day review would pose more difficult questions,
X think I ought to point out that Congress has been
sensitive to these kinds of concerns.

The most recent legis­

lation,which the President signed in August and which we
refer to in the first footnote of our .supplemental Brief,
extends from 30 to 60 days the time within which to challenge
the provision of the District of Columbia Circuit,

^0 that

Congress has been very careful not to cut off necessary
opportunities to receive and study the regulation before
deciding whether to object,
QUESTION:

Do you know of any other federal statute

that has a 30~day limitation?
MR, EASTERBROCK:

Your Honor, there are a number of

such statutes which are collected in one of the footnotes to
our brief. The Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and
Exchange Commission statutes contain 30-day limitations.

And

in both of those cases violation of the rules can be criminal,
can lead to criminal prosecution,
QUESTION:

Is there still a 10-day limit on criminal

appeals?
MR, EA&TERBROOK:

Yes, there is, I believe, Your

Honor,
QUESTION:

Of course, everyone in a criminal case

is quite aware of all of the conditions at the time the 10
days begins to run,
MR, EA.bTERBROOK:

Ten days would sometimes get

exceedingly close, in light of the possibility of mail delays
or perhaps negligence in delivering the mail, the subject of
an earlier case,
QUESTION:

Mr, Easterbrook, assume for the moment,

that the statute,in addition to authorizing the Administrator
to promulgate emission standards, contains an exception, the
substance of which read quite explicitly, that the Administrate
would have no authority to promulgate work rules„

And let's

assume further that the Administrator went ahead and promul­
gated what fairly could be characterized as a work rule.

34
Assume further there would be no appeal within the 30-day
period.

Would that present a different case?
MR, EASTERBRQCK:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

It would be the position of the United states that that
complaint should be raised within 30 days in the District of
Columbia Circuit.
The question, one again of national applicability
and one that ought to be resolved very quickly, is whether
this is or is not the kind of thing that Congress forbade.
QUESTION:

Even though it is perfectly clear that

the Administrator had violated the Act of Congress?
MR, SASTSRBROOK:

I believe so, Your Honor.

It

should be resolved in the D.C. Circuit.
The final ground for challenging, for arguing that
there is jurisdiction in the District Court,was one raised by
the District Court itself, which is that Section 307(b)(1)
refers only to the action of the Administrator "in promulgating"
an emission standard.

The District Court thought that this

meant that it referred only to procedural flaws and not to
substantive flaws.
The answer to that, of course, is that if 307(b)(l)
is interpreted in that way the evident desire of Congress is
again defeated, because it is impossible to have unified and
prompt review of the substantive rules.
Indeed, if the District Court were correct, the

35
District of Columbia Circuit would have absolutely no authority
to review the substantive portions of the objection.

But the

District of Columbia .Circuit, has held that it does, have
such authority, and w:e think, rightly so,

^

Petitioner's ultimate argument is simply that it Is
unfair to foreclose its attack on the regulation.
see the unfairness which Petitioner protests.

We do not

Public regula­

tory offenses, of which this is one, are often strict liability
offenses, that is, criminal sanctions can be imposed without
any form of mens rea.

The statute at issue here does not make

violation of the regulations a strict liability offense,
emission in violation of a regulation is criminal only If
done knowingly.

But what it does require is that persons

read the Federal Register at their peril or obtain someone
else to do that for them.
QUESTION:

It is a standard —

You mean fail to read it, fail to have

it available?
MR. EASTERBROQK:

Find out what is going on in

Washington that might effect their interests and take care
of them,
QUESTION:

That’s a large undertaking, don't you

agree?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It's a large undertaking and that,

I think, is one of the reasons for the formation of the
National Association of .Demolition Contractors.

But. my point

36
is that It is not unfair for Congress to require members of
the industry to undertake that kind of project to understand
and protect their own interests within a period of time.
Petitioner, or someone acting in his behalf, had
30 days within which to file a petition for review, and the
statute does provide that if any reasons arise later that.would
be good grounds for review they may be raised later.

The

statute is simply a plan that allocates judicial review to
a particular court at a particular time.

And we believe that

it should be respected*
I would like to make one final point in answer, to
Mr® Justice Brennan's first question of Mr. Lipnick,

The

case is still a live one, Mr. Justice Brennan, even though
the statute has been amended, because the acts at issue here
took place before the Amendment.

This is a criminal enforce"

ment proceeding and the ex post facto clause would prohibit
the application of the 1977 Amendments to this case, assuming
that the 1977 Amendments changed the law.

It is our position

that they did not change the law, and the legislative history
of these Amendments indicate that Congress was simply clari­
fying authority that the Administrator already possessed.
But if, in fact, Petitioner is right that the 1977 statute
did net authorize this regulation, this criminal prosecution
would not be assisted by the 1977 Amendments.
QUESTION:

You said it didn't change the law but it

37
says that ~~ words of the statute now, not the legislative
history» The August 3-977 statute talks about when it not
being feasible to prescribe an emission standard the
Administrator may instead promulgate work practice standards.
That sounds like they are two different animals,,
doesn't it?
MR. EASTERS ROCK:

It does, Mr. Justice Stewart.

We have addressed that problem In Footnote 2, two pages over

QUESTION:

I know, by referring to the legislative

history.
MR. EASTERBROQK:
history.

By referring to the legislative

Vis think it clear from the legislative history

that the reason Congress addressed them as two different
animals in the statute was to restrict the Administrator's
authority to use work practices Instead of numerical
limitations,
QUESTION:
out, as you know

Well, it says — I left some language
design, equipment, work practice or

operational standards.

What we are involved with here is a

work practice standard.
MR. EASTERBRQGK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

It is not very explicit.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

It is not, but I think that what

Congress had in mind by giving them different names was

QUESTION:

It certainly indicates they were

different things, if you have to call them by different names,
doesn't it?
MR» EA3TERBR00K:

If you want to achieve, if you

want to say that the Administrator must prefer numerical
units to work practice limitations, then I think you have to
call them by different names»

But the requirement that the

Administrator prefer one to the other is a new requirement
that we think was not present in the 1970 statute.
Thank you, very much.
QUESTION:

May I ask just one question about the

new statute that I don't — It may be clear from the text, but
I am not sure.

Did Congress also amend 307(b) at the same time

to make it clear that review of the work practice rule would
be in the Court of Appeals?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

It did not amend that in 307(b).

307(b)(1) still refers to emission standards promulgated
under Section 112»
QUESTION:

Thank you,

QUESTION:

Where do you now review work practice

standards?
MR» EASTDRBROOK:

They are treated as emission

standards, promulgated under section 112 and reviewed in the
District of Columbia Circuit.
QUESTION:

By what authority?

39
MR6 BASTEEBROOK:
QUESTION:

Under Section 307(b)(1).

Well, that's the most circular thing I

ever heard of.

legislative draftsmanship, Mr* Justice Relinquish.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Lipnick.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP STANLEY M. LIPNICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. LIPNICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I have only a few brief observations.
First, the National Association of Demolition
Contractors which suddenly seems to have backed in as a party
to this case, was in fact first organized within a very few
months previous to the promulgation of the work practice
regulation.

It is true that the National Association of

Demolition Contractors now undertakes certain legal activities
which might be described as done jointly for its members.

It

is also true that that legal work was undertaken in response
to the very problem which underlies this very case which is
that small businessmen do not read ten and twenty thousand
pages of fine print of the Federal Register every year, and
they particularly don't d:> It In 30 days.

And I am not

aware of any Act of Congress which says that they have to do
so.

I 'chink a reference was made to the notice of
proceeding of the Administrator from the standpoint of
publishing a proposed regulation for commento

I am not

sure that my client, Adamo Wrecking Company, knew about the
proposed regulation, either.
company knew about it*

I am not sure that any wrecking

I am sure that anybody picking it up

to'read it would find on the very first page, 23239 of Volume
36 of the Federal Register, quote:

"The sources covered in

the asbestos standard are; mining, milling, spraying and
manufacturing.»"

Period, close quote.

QUESTION:

May I ask you:

I think —
In the criminal enforce­

ment proceeding, what is the state of knowledge by the
defendant supposed to be for liability?
MR. LIPNIOK:

As a matter of law?

I believe under the Boyce Motor Lines case we have
to be shown to have knowledge of the facts which would con­
stitute a violation of the law*

I take that to mean we have

to know that the material we are dealing with is, in fact,
friable asbestos, as. defined in the regulation,and that we
must also know that whatever it is we are proved to have done
would in fact cause an emission of that material*
QUESTION;

But it isn't required that you know

anything about the law.
MR* LIPNICK:

I believe that this Courtis decisions

in Boyce Motor Lines and its progeny make it very clear that

our knowledge of the law is absolutely irrelevant.
QUESTION:

I just wondered if, under this statute,

It imposes any different standard?
MHa LIPNXCK:

Not that I am aivare of.

I think the

word is just knowingly, and I think that's, «-r - the meaning of
that tern is well settled.
I think that it is obvious on the face of the
statute that Congress did not tell the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, "Just go out and do whatever
you think is best to control emissions of asbestos .!l

Congres

for whatever reason, and as the 1977 Amendments teach us,
Congress changed its mind and was persuaded that it should
have done something differently in the first place.

Congress

originally told the Administrator to go out and promulgate
an emission standard.
I think even before the 1977 Amendments, there is
no way that this Act can be read as £ whole, and particularly
the references in other sections of the Act to emission
standards. There is just no way that one can conclude that
it Ss reasonable to think that an emission standard is now or
ever could have been the same thing as a work practice rule.
They must be different things.
QUESTION:

What if Congress had passed a law that

simply said anything labeled an emission standard by the
Administrator and not challenged within 30 days of its

4-2
promulgation* shall be deemed written into the statute itself?
Would you have any case?
MR, LIPNICK:

I think ~~ Well* the closest case I

would have would be Thermtron from last year, which, If I
recall correctly, the statute said a decision remanding to a
state court was absolutely unreviewable, And this Court said
that it was at least reviewable to ascertain that the trial
judge had remanded on a ground specified as a basis for re­
mand in the statute,
I think if we can have that much inquiry here we
can look to see whether this regulation is, in fact, an
emission standard.

That's what we are charged with violating,

an emission standard.

There is no section of this Act which

says, or at least we are not

There is a section of this

Act, 113* if I recall correctly, Which says that ltEs a crime
to knowingly violate any regulation issued as part of a state
implementation plan, under Section 110,

It is a crime to

violate any regulation Issued under Section 110 as part of a
state Irani em eh t a 11 on p la n,
The section we are charged with violating does not
say it’s a crime to violate any regulation the Administrator
might issue.
standard.

It only says it's a crime to violate an emission

And if we can have the same scope of review as was

accorded in the’Hermensdorfer case last year, I think that
is enough to allow us to show that this regulation is not an

43
emission standard, if indeed, we are asking for review of the
regulation»
In our view, we still think that there is a sub­
stantial question whether we are asking for a imllng by the
trial court

on whether this indictment alleges an essential

element of the crime»
QUESTION:

Mr» Lipniek, if we should be persuaded

that the jurisdictional issue depends on whether or not it's
an emission standard ~~ la.other words, you .have to decide
the merits to decide whether 307(b)(2) applies.

In your view,

should the District Court decide that question or should we
send it back to the Court of Appeals? Because the Court of
Appeals did not decide that question, if I remember.
MR, LIPNICK:

In our view, sir, I think the record

is perfectly adequate to enable this Court to decide it,
particularly with the 1977 Amendments which I think make
abundantly clear that a work practice rule just is not the
same thing as an emission standard* And the Government, just today, said In the
Government’s view, the 1977 Amendments don't change the law,
I think that even without these facts, I think It is so clear
on the face of the statute that this Court can decide the
question in the interest of judicial economy.

But with the

addition of the *77 Amendments and with the Government's
position that the [77 Amendments don't change anything, I

44
think that if this Court should conclude that there is
jurisdiction, I don't see how there is any room for doubt as
to the result.
If I recall correctly, in the Perkins case, which
is cited in the Government's brief, this Court indicated that
where the record was adequate to enable this Court to decide
a question which had not seen decided by the Court of Appeals,
that it would do so in the interest of judicial economy.

And

I would suggest that would be appropriate in this case,
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:44 o'clock, p„m„, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
