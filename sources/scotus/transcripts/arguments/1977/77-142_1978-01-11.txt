MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-142, United States v. Donald Lavern Culbert.
Ma.-s. Beale, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARA S. BEALE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MI’S. BEALE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case comes before this Court on the government’s
petition for review of a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals holding that, although respondent’s conduct in this case
falls within the language of the Hobbs Act (18 U.S.C. 1951), it
was nontheless not within the reach of that Act because it did
not also constitute racketeering.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that
respondent’i conduct fell within the exclusive criminal juris­
diction of the State of California.

Let me reiterate at the

cutset that there is no dispute that respondent's conduct fell
within the e scpress terms of the Act which prohibits — which
reaches the conduct of whoever’ in any way or in any degree ob­
structs

delays or affects commerce by either robbery cr extor­

tion or who attempts or conspires to do so.
QUESTION:

You say there is no dispute except that

the court didn't seem to follow that?
MIS. BEALE:

Well, there is no dispute that falls

within that language.

The question is whether the Act should

be construed to have an additional limitation to racketeering,
but it falls within the express terms.
The evidence showed that in April of 1975, respondent
and his accomplice attempted to extort $100,000 from a federally
insured ban] that was doing business in interstate commerce.
Respondent’s accomplice telephoned the bank's president and
threatened to detonate remote controlled bombs at both the bank
and the home; of the bark president unless certain instructions
were followed.
The bank president then took a package of false cur­
rency that lad been supplied, by the Federal Bureau, of Investiga­
tion and left it at the spot that had been designated fcy
respondent's accomplice.

The respondent and his accomplice

never picked up this package because it was found almost im­
mediately by two small children who opened it and tore apart
the packages of false currency.
Following the jury trial in the Northern District of
Califor; ia, respondent was convicted of both violation of the
Hobbs At arl also of attempted bank robbery.

Although the

Court of Appeals reversed both of these two convictions, the
govern® rt seeks review in this Court only of its ruling regard­
ing respondent's conviction under the Hobbs Act.
Tie Court of Appeals concluded, relying upon an earlier
decision of the Sixth Circuit, that cor,duct such as respondent's

5
which is proscribed by the expressed terms of the Hobbs Act,
must also bo proven to constitute racketeering in order to be
within the reach of that Act.

The court rested this construc­

tion of the Act on two distinct grounds:

First, on its reading

of congressional intent, and, second, on its view of the con­
siderations of federalism.

The court did not in its opinion

define the t erra "racketeering," and that is the point to whicfy' I
...

will return later in my argument.

It did, however, corelude
\

'

that there was no evidence of racketeering in the present case.,
Judge Carter dissented from the reversal of the conviction
under the Hobbs Act.
I i/ant co stress that the Court of Appeals did not
suggest and respondent does not content that Congress lacked the
constitutional authority to prohibit all of the conduct which
does fall within the expressed terms of the Hobbs Act.

The

breadth of Congress’ power under the Interstate Commerce Clause
is firmly established and it is in no way questioned here.
Tie Court of Appeals simply concluded that considera­
tions of federalism militated against any conclusion that
Congress had intended what that court viewed as a major incursion
into areas c : state concern, and as a result that court adopted
the limiting construction of the Act which is at issue 'iere.
The language of the Act itself, which is of course the
primary guide to its meaning, contains no support for this con­
struction.

Phe Act does not define nor does it even mention the

6
terra "racketeering," nor does it contain any qualifying words
that might -be thought to exempt conduct which might not amount
to racketeering.

Instead, the Act is broadly drafted to reach

anyone who :.n any way or degree obstructs or affects commerce
by either robbery or extortion.
Accordingly, the heart of this case is respondent's
contention that the sweeping language which Congress employed
requires the limiting construction of the Act in order to pre­
vent a wholesale invasion of the criminal jurisdiction of the
states, a result which respondent contends was not within, the
intention of Congress.
I would like to turn first to the question of the
legislative history of the Act.

I will not attempt here to re­

view in greet detail the various congressional committee reports
that were issued in connection with both the Hobbs Act and its
immediate predecessor, the Act of June 18, 1934, nor will I try
c.: ;, rev:.ew :.n detail the debates.

These matters are discussed

at length xr. our brief.
I do want to make two principal points in connection
with
QtSSTION:

I take it the theory of your case is that

you don't need to look at the legislative history at all’
MRS. BEALE;

Well, I think that the language of the

Act is very plain, but x^hen one looks at the legislative history,
one finds nc .Mag that supports a conclusion that is really at

7
variance with that plain and very broad language.
M] first point in connection with the legislative
history of the Act is that although it was an outgrowth of
congressional concern with so-called racketeering, chat in no
way indicates that Congress intended, seme unstated limitation
which appears neither in the Act itself nor in the committee
reports tc some concept cf racketeering, whatever that may be.
QL'ESTION:

Mrs. Beale, has the government utilized

the Act in cases such as this only recently?
ML.S. BEALE:

I think there has been no substantial

change in the enforcement of the Hobbs Act in its some thirty
years since it was enacted.

It has received no new construction

and I an not aware of any substantial change in enforcement
practices.
Qt'EfiTIONs

Hasn't it usually been restricted to where

you cross slate lines?
MLS. BSALE:

Well, there are several policies that are

currently used by the department to determine what are appro­
priate

rear or appropriate kinds of cases in which Hobbs Act:

enforcement — in which the Hobbs Act should be enforced, and
they differ according to whether robbery or extortion is at
issue.

The department at present — and I am not certain when

this policy was first promulgated — it is not of particular
recent origin, but in robbery cases the department

as a matter

of policy restricts prosecution in most instances to cases where

8
there is either a showing of organized crime involvement or an
extensive scheme of some sort.
Now, in practice there is also an attempt to limit
other kinds of cases to areas where there is what is thought to
be ei substantial federal concern,

And a point that I want to

dir,cuss shortly is that concerns really the reality of the con­
cern with the invasion of state interests.

And a point that I

was going tc mention is that there were only 166 nationwide
indictments under the Hobbs Act in 1976, and that perhaps will
give some kind of an idea of what the enforcement, pattern, cur­
rently is.
QUESTION;

Mrs. Beale, you. mention that the department

limits its prosecution to cases where there is substantial

federal concern.
yoi remember .

Mrs.

You cited the Staszcuk case

in

your brief,

if

What was the substantial federal concern there?
BEALE;

Well, the Staszcuk case was a prosecution

under the color of official right portion of the Act.
QUESTION:

It was a. zoning bribery case, wasn't, it?

MIS. BEALE;
QUESTION:

Local zoning?

MILS. BEALE:

Right.

a

Well, I think one of the consid­

— and a theme that recurs in the

legislative history of the Act -- is a real concern for
offenser.; which (a) affect commerce, and

(b) where the states

have not; acted and are not prosecuting offenses —

9
QUESTIONS

In other words, the substantial federal

concern is that the state isn't doing a good job in enforcing
its own laws?
tRS. BEALE:

Well,

I think that where interstate com­

merce is interfered with by means of extortion, where color of
official r.-.ght is involved, that is an area, particularly where
the concern that Congress express where in fact the states
were not acting is at issue.
QUESTION:

There wasn't really a terrible interference

with interstate commerce in that case, was there?
f‘R3. BEALE:

The veterinary hospital was never built.

I wouldn' t disagree that Staszcuk raay be a case that cn the
fringes arte

that there may not among 166 prosecutions in a

year* bo some which are on the edge and some such as the present
case are clearly in the main —
QUESTION:

-Isn't it true that the statute has fre­

quently been used, at least in the Seventh Circuit, tc prosecute
political type crimes where the local law enforcement authori­
ties were rot enforcing the local laws?
RRS. BEALE:

Well, I guess I am not prepared to dis­

cuss particularly the Seventh Circuit enforcement.
it is clear

I do think

that the Act itself contains a specific provision

dealing with extortion under color of official right and that
that fits cuite comfortably with the concern in the legislative
history that where, there are crimes affecting interstate

10

conmarce, and particularly where the states don’t act, and
that is very likely to happen in cases of offieieil corruption,
that that would be an appropriate area of federal concern.

So

I would not: be surprised to see a pattern such as that in the
Seventh Circuit.
QUESTION;

Well, why do you say you wouldn't be sur­

prised to see such a pattern in the Seventh Circuit?
[Laughter]
MRS. B3ELALE:

I’m not sure I intended quite that.

That was only in response to the earlier question.
QUESTION;

Well, you mentioned 166 cases in a year,

and in add;tion you have 94 United States Attorneys offices
in policing, the monitoring, perhaps I should say, the monitor­
ing of the day-to-day decisions.

That is not a simple task, X

suppose,
MRS. BEALE:

Oh, I think that is quite right, but

there is — and this is the only point that we raise in our
brief to suggest that there is an effort to try and exert scans
kind of. control on the part of the department which is I think
wholly com is tent 'with the fact that the Act is very broadly
drafted?

and it was merely in response to the question'of how

was the Act enforced.
ION;

a

At any rate —
The bank here — may I interrupt ■— was

national bank, wasn't it?
MRS. BEALE;

Pardon me?

11
QUESTION:

The bank that was the subject of this

extortion was a national bank?
MRS. BEALE:

That's quite right, it was a federally

insured bank and there was also evidence of its doing business
in interstate commerce, and I think that is not. at all any —
QUESTION:

Suppose it had been a state bank, not in™

sured under the FDIC, would that have made a difference?
MRS. BEALE:
have arguec

Well, it seans to me at least

in our brief

and we

that the banking industry is one in

which really occupies a special position in interstate commerce
and really serves as one of the channels of interstate com­
merce, and I think a prosecution for extortion of a state bank
would not he an inappropriate exercise of federal power, and I
think it: could be shewn to have an effect probably on interstate
commerce ii

a given case,

QUESTION:

And the proof in this case showed inter­

state eoranu rce?
MRS. BEALE:
QUESTION;

That rs correct.
Well, the statutory authority is the

motive;, of the United States Attorney, is that dispositive or
very ir.por 1 -.ant?
MRS. BEALE:

No, I think that they are not disposi­

tive and, c.s 1 say, this was raised only in connection with
g to quantify what is the practice under the Act, how many
prosecutions are.there, because that goes to the issue suggested

12
by respondents and the concern raised by the Court of Appeals
a 3 to whether the broad language of this Act has resulted or
will result in some kind of wide spire ad incursion into areas of
t raditional state concern.

I think it is only relevant for

that reason because of the concern expressed below.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Beale,- under the literal language of

the Act, I suppose, wouldn't you agree, it would cover robbery
of goods from a department store that were destined to move and
had moved

Ln interstate commerce and was destined to be sold to

customers af the store?
MRS. BEALE:

I think an effect on interstate commerce

can be shown, and it is clear that the Act applies whore an
act is shown
QUESTION:
IRS. BEALE:

And wouldn't it apply to that case?
Well, I think that that could he estab­

lished.
}UESTIOK:

Would it also apply to the furniture that

was in the home, that it had bean shipped in interstate com­
merce?
IRS. BEALE:

I think we may be getting rear the

fringes.
QUESTION:

Well, if it is robbery, it has to be

robbery or extortion affecting commerce?
MRS. BEALE:

Right.
But I would like to get back to this

MRS. BEALE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Do you think that is a different kind of

case?
MRS. BEALE:

Well, I see no reason for distinguishing

either in terms of the legislative intent or the considerations
of federali sm as to whether some kind of additional concept not
stated i.n the Act should be applied or construed into the Act.
The legislative history makes it quite clear that at the time
the Hobbs lot was enacted, those who opposed the Act argued
that every state had laws covering both extortion and robbery,
and th y argued that this Act should not be passed because it
would be a wholly unwarranted incursion into these areas of
state concern,

They said yes,

garding robbery, but insofar as if affects interstate com­
merce these laws have not been enforced in many instances, there
is a birder and effect on interstate commerce and the Hobbs Act
must foe: passed in order to protect the flow of interstate com­
merce.

That is the argument that carried the day.

Let rae ask you an unfair question then.

Why didn't the Solicitor General seek cert in Yokley?

QUESTION:

Could there be an embezzlement that

wouldn't be under this statute?

Because money travels in inter­

definition of the Act.

that Congress either would want to or would have the power to

That’s correct.

And so if you rob somebody of money, you

MRS. BEALE:

Well, counsel might be able to make that

argument, but I suspect a jury would not find that there had
really bees

an effect on interstate commerce, if I robbed some­

one of five dollars on the corner.

At any rate, I do want to

make a few additional points.

\

(ne is that the legislative history clearly indicates
\

' r:

that there was no settled meaning for the term "racketeeringi ? ■
a..though c< ngress was concerned in 1934 and in 1945 with a
variety of problems that wore described as racketeerirg.
distinct meaning.

f

That

The committee which was investi­

gating the problem of racketeering found it necessary to adopt
a working definition to guide its investigation, and it stated
that it war

necessary to adopt such a definition because the

tern "rack? ter ring" was being used to refer to activities that
were not even criminal, to activities that were immoral, to
activities that were fraudulent, to wide varieties.
I-

other point is that it seems inconceivable in that

n

17

regard, that a coranitt.ee that was so aware of the vagueness of
the definition of the term "racketeering" would nevertheless
have intended to make that a part of a federal criminal statute
without mentioning it in the Act, without defining it, without
making it clear in the committee reports.
Another point regarding the legislative history of
the Act is that there is a suggestion both in respondent’s
brief and by the court below that because the originating com­
mittee was concerned with racketeering and because there are
various expressions of support for the bill as an antiracketaering measure, the bill should be construed as limited
to this

oik

kind of problem* only to racketeering.

vf that //ere true, it seems to me that all of the 90sone bills that were proposed by this same committee at the
close of its investigation on racketeering, which ranee from
kidnapping to mutiny in. federal prisons, to interstate trans­
portation of stolen property, that all of those would likewise
have to be limited to racketeering.

And it seems to ire that it

is simply rot reasonable to construe all of the committee's
work as limited to racketeering when it never expressed the
desire that that should be done, and when this was not made an
element of the particular statute.
have already mentioned the fact that the debates on
the Hobbs I et made very clear the fact that Congress was well
aware of the fact that the crimes being defined in the Hobbs

18

Act were crimes which are already punishable under state law.
And indeed it was recognised that the definitions which appear
in the Hobbs Act ware derived arid were taken directly from the
New York Penal Coda.
QUESTION

°

The Hobbs Act doesn't preempt state law*

does it?
MRS. BEALEs

No* that is exactly right.

No one has

ever suggested that merely because Congress found it desirable
and necessary to define this area to allow federal prosecutions
that it had intended that the states should not be allowed to
prosecute robbery and extortion* and indeed they do sc today.
:: think it is time to turn from the legislative his­
tory to the; considerations of federalism which really underlay
the court's; reading of the legislative history.
r he first point that I would like to make is: one
which I. touched on somewhat earlier.

The Court of Appeals

suggested that the limiting construction which it app3ied to
♦

the i-c . war essential in order to prevent a really widescale
invasion and incursion onto the criminal jurisdiction of the
states.
t just mention in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's
question tl at the Act has never been interpreted nor was it
intend d t< preempt the statees.

In addition* as I noted

earlier, there has been no widescale incursion into areas
causing a general problem.

There were 166 prosecutions

19
na tionwid e in 197 6.
Again turning to this particular prosecutior , we
think it is: a good example of one where there is a strong
federal interest involved.

The federal government we believe

has the compelling interest in prosecuting under its own laws
an attempted extortion from a bank that it insures, that serves
businesses in many states, and that is part of an industry that
perhaps more than any other facilitates the flow of interstate
commerce.
In any event, even assuming that there are factual
situations that fall within the literal language of the Hobbs
Act, beat ij

which there is no substantial federal interest,

requiring j coof of racketeering would in no way serve to screen
out those cases in which there is minimal federal interest.
I It hough the Court of Appeals provided no definition

of racketeering, it seems clear that there is nothing inherent
in that concept which suggests that racketeers could prey only
or. bus. nesses or on persons who are heavily involved in inter­
state commerce.
cites a goc;

Indeed, the respondent's brief indicates and

portion of the legislative history to show that,

many rackets are of essentially local character, therefore
limiting th a Act to racketeering seems to have very little to
dc with a .1 sgitimate concern for state sovereignty.
Indeed, the fact that the prosecution we have at
issue here falls outside the scope of the Act as it was defi

20

by the Court of Appeals, despite the vital federal interest,
demonstrates the fallacy of assuming that the Act, that limit­
ing the Act to racketeering will somehow serve the purpose of
screening out these cases which are less directly related to
the federal interest»
QUESTION:

Mrs. Beale, you said that many rackets are

of purely local interest.

What did you mean by the term

"rackets"?
MRS. BEALE:

I was referring to the portions of the

legislative history that are particularly cited and emphasized
in respondent's brief.

There are many problems in the legisla­

tive history which are so-called rackets or racketeering, many
definition.1

But some of those with which Congress was clearly

concerned as shown by the legislative history seem to be of an
essentially local nature, and it seems clear that Congress took
the defit

, the working definition of the committee in

lf,3 4 and adapted that definition in the 193 4 Act. to make: it
suitable for federal, for use in a federal criminal statute.
I : charged the definition in two primary ways.

The working

definition was an organised conspiracy to commit eith€r coercion
or extortion — excuse me, robbery or coercion.

The committee

added to tl at definition in the 193 4 Act the requirement that
there he as

impact on interstate commerce, and they deleted the

requ;Lr«nen1 that there fca an organized conspiracy.

of that case.

I don't remember the name

MRS. BEALE;

In fact, I think that a close examina"

tion of the legislative history really makes a stronger case
than that.

There simply is other than the fact that there are

expressioni] of concern regarding racketeering, there is no
showing that any unstated, any limitation that was unstated in
the Act. to some definition of racketeering was intended, so it
is even a clearer case than that, which you make.
In sum, we believe that since neither the legislative
history nor any concerns for federalism justify importing a
vague concept into the Act which will simply make more diffi­
cult its enforcement, without in any way screening out eases
in which tl.are is a lesser federal imterest, shows that there
in no grounds for -the construction of the Act urged by the —
chosen by the Court of Appeals, and we therefore respectfully
submit that

its judgment should be reversed.

alternative and stretch a commerce statute that was aimed at
to fill a loophole, and by doing so the inevitable
consequence is a blanket incursion into an area traditionally
enforced by the states.
When you say it was aimed at racketeering,

24
Mr. Hewitt, what do you mean by racketeering?
MR. HEWITT:

I think the definition, the working

definition adopted by the committee pretty well expresses what
racketeering meant in the. thirties and I suppose what it: means
to most people at the present time, an organized criminal con­
spiracy, perhaps an on-going criminal conspiracy, not certainly
an isoiatec event.

Do you think anyone could lie punished under

this statute then?

corner liquor store is a violation of the Hobbs Act, if we give

What I am asking you is if you take Yokley

as the law and the decision of the Ninth Circuit in this case
as the law. do you think anyone can be validly indicted under
this particular section, in view that, you have to read in the
racketeerir.g qualification, which to me is rather amorphous?
MR. HEWITT:

Yes, I think that they could be indicted

25
and prosecuted and convicted if they were found to be engaged
in racketeering, and I see no reason why the definition could
not be the definition offered by the Copeland committee as the
working definition.

banks.

Th:.s was aimed at interstate commerce as it was known

in 1934 and 1937, and we know that in that era, in the New
Deal era, Congress was very sensitive about intruding into the
state’s reserve powers.
QUESTION?

Well, how about the Fair Labor Standards

Act, which was passed in 1938, would you say that: was an ex­
ample of congressional sensitivity?
MR. HEWITT:

I think there was certainly recognition

and discussion of whether or not this would be an intrusion
into the ve nted powers cf the states, and the resolutior. I think
was made that this was an

area where the federal government

does have an interest.
My concern here is that what has happened is that the
definition of interstat

miner ce has evolved with the opera-

ti >n of the de minimis rule to cover just about any instru­
mentality, including the corner grocery store.
QUESTION:

but do we need to worry about the corner

grocery store in a case where we are dealing with a national
br.nk.
MR. HEWITT:

Well, I admit, Your Honor, I

would

feel safer if I were here with the K Mart department store in
)

the Sixth C ircuit.
QUESTION:
Mil. HEWITT:

Or the corner liquor store?
Well, if the statute itself could be so

broadly interpreted, and if the only limitation upon its

28
application where there is a threat of intrusion and an up­
setting of the balance of federalism, the only lira it at ion is
the discretion of the prosecutor that he is not going to push,
he is not going to enforce the statute as broadly as is read,
but he will choose to limit it so as not to intrude upon the
vested interests of tie states, I don't think that is a suf­
ficient protection to preserve that balance.
C1UESTI0M:

Mr. Hewitt, I have another problem with

your reading in this exception for racketeering.

If racketeer­

ing is a conspiracy to use intimidation to extort money or
whatever the language was, why isn't that what this was anyway?
This was two people involved in this plan to rcb, to threaten
this person with violence in order to get money out of the
bank.

Why doesn't it fit right within the racketeeering

dof ini :.ion anyway?
MR. HEWITT;

Well, it was never prosecuted cn that:

theory nor was it submitted to —
QUESTION;
it vrlolatec

Well, it was prosecuted on the theory that

the statute, and you say no, it doesn't violate the

statute because it is not racketeering, and then you describe
racketeering in a way that I think fits these facts* cr did I
miss something?
hi. HEWITT;

Well, I think the concept of racketeer­

ing, if we are to give it the meaning that Congress obviously
intended in the thirties, must be an on-going operation more

29

than an isolated transaction, kind of an organised criminal
conspiracy,

as they define it, and I —-

QUESTION:

It will be on-going if he goes to the

Obviously, if he goes to the penitentiary, it

will be on--going.
MR. HEWITT:

It may well be that this were evidence

of a series of bank robberies by these same individuals, we
might have seme organised crime or racketeering that would fit
within —QUESTION:

Your observation would put a rather severe

crimp on the federal kidnapping statute, would it not?
MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:

Well —
Usually you don't have chain store opera­

tions with kidnappings* even though we did in the thirties.
Kidnapping is an isolated act, as this was conceived as an
isolated act.
MR. HEWITT:

Well, I think the legislative history

behind the kidnapping act is

certainly going at the isolated

transaction rather than any on-going enterprise, and certainly
Congress had indicated in enacting the kidnapping statute that
it was intruding into what would be ordinarily state police
power, but it made specific findings that because of the
mobility of the kidnapper the states were powerless tc have
proper control.
QUESTION:

Well, is not the same thing true about the

30
loan sharking statute that we sustained two or three years
ago?
MRo HEWITTs

Yes, and I think Congress could very

well, similar to the loan shaking statute, find that racketeer™
i ig has such an effect on interstate commerce that all rackete nring may be punished federally.
QUESTION:

Well, is this farther away from federal

concern than loan sharking?
PR. HEWITT:

MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:
MR. HEWITT:

I don’t think so.

This case, this statute.
I think the primary federal cotcorn hare

is incidental only, that is that it is a national bank over
which the federal government has plenary power and interest.
QUESTION:

Whereas in the loan, sharking case , you

d >:i't have any national aspect except that it had some, as the
d .ssenters thought, some very remote effect and impact on
i it er s bate c arm ere:;.
MR. HEWITT:

But Congress there, Your Honor, made a

finding that loan sharking does affect commerce either under the
bunkrupey clause or the commerce clause that is very difficult
to show as an element of proof in connection with commerce :o
justify jurisdiction, therefore the class of activity at. which
t 1« legislation was aimed in Perez, loan sharking, it was

sufficient to show that the person was a member of that class
and nothing more.

Congress could have done the same thing

here but they didn't.

My suggestion is that the legislative

history indicates very clearly that. Congress was talking about,
frankly they were talking about labor racketeering.
QUESTION;

But do you have a quarrel, Mr,, Hewitt,

with the constitutional basis for this particular prosecution,
that there was insufficient basis for connecting this particu­
lar extortion with the movement of goods in interstate com­
merce?
MR. HEWITT:

I don't think we can, Your Honor.

I

think the predicate was laid in the course of the trial that
most banks, I almost say all banks have a. sufficient connection
upon interstate commerce, a sufficient connection with it under
the depletion of assets theory an! many others.
QUESTION:

To me this is a better case for the

government than Perez which I think, frankly, had I been on the
Court, I would have regarded as quite doubtful,

MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:,.

Constitutiona1ly?
Constitutionally.
But you are not making a constitutional

32
claim?
MR. HEWITT:

Kop sir, I'm certainly not.

I'm simply

saying that in the legislative history, it is clear that
Congress was talking in the Hobbs Act and the Copeland Act
before abort extortion and robbery affecting interstate com­
merce.

During the same legislation, at the same time the

legislation was being considered, they were protecting national
banks with the bank robbery statute.

Nov?, they left a gaping

hole and the question is whether that hole can be filled withi

out doing violence to the considerations of federalism, and we
suggest that it can.
QUESTION:

Well, just exactly vrhat constitutional

right was denied to your client?
MR. HEWITTi

Well, I'm not really making a constitu­

tional argument, Mr. Justice Marshall.

Well, what federal statute was violated?

I m trying to find out what your complaint is that we can get
to.

The complaint is that the court below

MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:

The complaint is —
You say it is not constitutional, so it

must be statutory.
MR. HEWITT:

Well, yes, it is statutory.

He was con­

victed of a statute that requires a showing of more than simply
an act affecting commerce under the de minimis theory.
QUESTION:

Your theory is that by some provision of'

the Constitution, you read into a statute something that isn't
in the statute.
MR. HEWITT:

Well, I think that I am asking this

Court to read into the statute a limitation that will prevent
the statute from being applied, thereby intruding into the
vested police power of the states.
QUESTION:

Then it seems to me you are obliged to

show that if we don't do that, your client has had some con­
stitutional provision violated.
MR. HEWITT:

If not, why are you here?

No, I don't think there is any constitu­

tional issue —

against the. state that is not a federal offense.
QUESTION:

What if the amount extorted or sought to

would you think then if the demand had been that large you
would have a real impact on interstate commerce?
MR. HEWITT:
iupact on commerce.

Your Honor, I’m not concerned with the
I think there is sufficient impact here to

support, constitutional jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

But then if there is a sufficient impact,

doesn't that give a federal concern which seems to be the
fulcrum of your argument, that there is insufficient federal
concern here?
MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:

No, that is not my argument either.
I thought you said you wanted to be con­

victed by a state court.
MR. HEWITT:

That’s right, he wants to be convicted

for a legitimate crime rather than have the federal law
twisted around to inject the federal government into zn area
where

.hey don’t belong unless Congress has specifically in­

dicated we wish to inject federal enforcement into this narrow
area.
QUESTION:

Of course, if you really can't be tried by

the state court, has the statute run?
MR» HEWITT:

No, I don’t believe it has, Your Honor.

He couldn't be tried by the state only because California has
a penal code provision that prohibits it.

If he were prosecuted

in the state, ha could foe prosecuted again in the federal

35

government or in a state in which no provision was made.
QUESTION;

But he hasn’t been indicted in the state

court.
MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:

No.
And how long is the statute in the state

court?
MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:

Five years.
Are you familiar with the Camen Eddy case?,

Mr. Hewitt, back a. good many years ago, 1917, involving the
Mann Act, where the legislative history of the Mann Act was
very clear that it was directed at the so-called white slave
traffic, where the literal terms of the statute covered cash
holding on eartiu=rei.al episode between Missouri and Kansas,
Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas, I think, and the
conviction was affirmed here?
MR. HEWITTS
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Isn’t the argument you are making precisely

the kind of argument that was rejected in that case?
MR. HEWITT:

No, for this reasons

I think that it

the legislative history was crystal clear that the literal

terms of the statute covered this single casual non-commercial
episode ant. this Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Day,

MR. HEWITT:

I can recall the hyperbole being used

of driving across the 14th Street Bridge with evil intent would
violate the Mann Act at that time.

Of course, Congress in the

thirties was very sensitive to the considerations of federalism.
The Justice. Department at that time, statements were made by
Attorney General Mitchell and later by Attorney General
Cummings that they were concerned with the fiscal consequences
of injecting the federal government into the states and assum­
ing toe, much responsibility, fear that otherwise if they in­
jected then selves too greatly into state law enforcement that
the states

ould themselves stop beefing up their police and

stop chasing after gangsters, so the gangster era.
So I think it is fairly clear that the Racketeering
Act of 1934 was si ted at the primary federal interest of inter­
state commerce.
racketeering.

But certainly a secondary interest was
And having defined racketeering as an organised

conspiracy to commit extortion, we suggest that the court
could turn to that definition as the definition that Congress

37

obviously was using when it was considering this legislation.
As suggested before, this Court in Jerome looked over
*

legislative history to define felony as that term was used in
Jerome.
QUESTION:
Day's opinion

But if as a moment ago, as Mr. Justice

is thought by the Congress and accepted by the

Court that this was not an undue incursion into state's police
power, hasn't the world become more complex and travel much
swifter and all other things going opposite from the direction
that you argue?
MR. HEWITT:
|

It certainly has, and I would have to

concede that were Congress to consider this bill today, Congress
would probably find that it is advantageous to assume this role
and this responsibility in the states and I'm sure that they
would enact, a statute as broad as this if not broader, if
possible.

But I don't think that we can consider what their

innent might be today under similar circumstances.

I think the

question it what was the intent of Congress in 1934 ard * 37 and
later in 1?46 when the Hobbs Act amended the Anti-Racketeering
Act, and I submit that there is no indication -(1EST.I0H:

MR. HEWITT:

I think this is reflected in the legis­

lation, the outgrowth of the thirties legislation, with the
mobility and the change in the world.

Like I say, I think

were such that the federal government had to protect federal,

And we are stuck with not what they could

MR. HEWITT:

Well, in forty years I suppose Congress

realized ttat they may have to define terms more specifically
than they did in the middle thirties.

At that time they felt

that there probably would be no encroachment upon state police
power r ir.-.ef at that time a direct effect upon interstate
commerce was required.

They were speaking in terms of the

40
poultry racket and the shakedowns that gave rise to this
Court's decision in Local 007,
)

They weren't thinking that

interstate ccxnmerce would mean a corner grocery store or a
small business with just a de minimis effect on commerce.

And

I don't think that there is any suggestion in the legislative
history that Congress dreamed that this extortion act aimed at
labor racketeering would ever be used to fill the loophole in
the bank robbery statute, and I think that is precisely what
has been done here.

I don't think that relying upon the

Justice Department to limit itself will solve the problem.

I

think that the Court has to find whether or not this statute
beincr broadly applied would be an intrusion into state
))

sovereignty, I think the Court should give it a restrictive
g!css and prevent any upsetting of that delicate balance.
If there are no further questions, I would thank
Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Hewitt.

Do you have anything further, Mrs. Beale?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARA S. BEALE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER—REBUTTAL
MRS. BEALE:
^

Just a few brief points.

The first is

that, despite respondent's argument, there is not one shred

of legislative history that indicates an intent to place an
unstated limitation on this broad language to limit it only to
some kind of activities called racketeering.

The 193 4 Act was

41
officially titled :sAn Act to protect trade and commerce against
interference by violence, threats, coercion or intimidation» "
That word

’racketeering" is not mentioned in either of the two

Acts? it is not mentioned in the titles, and we do not believe
a fair reading of the legislative history indicates that there
was intended to have some unstated limitation.

We think the

fact that there is no definite definition of racketeering
fully supports that point.
'.'here is a definition of racketeering in section
1151 of Title 18.

That definition was adopted I believe in

1370, and certainly it cannot be suggested that that definition
was intend<2d to apply ir. 193 4.

The committee definition is

clearly not what Congress intended to reach in either of the
two Acts*

the committee's working definition, in view of the

fact that the committee reports clearly reflect, the fact that
no limitat ion to a conspiracy or some kind of organized
activity was intended to be required by this Act.

They pur­

posely omi .fed that particular element.
Indeed, I should not® that the committee's working
definition was first publicly published in a report that ap­
peared in 1937 detailing three years of its work.

That working

definition does not appear in the committee reports which were
pit out to define the scopa of the 193 4 Act that wa have in
question here, and they do not appear directly in connection
with the legislative history of that Act,.

Simply a working

42
definition of all of the work of a committee that introduced
90-some bills in 1934, bills relating to kidnapping, to mutiny
in federal penal institutions, to interstate transportation of
stolen property, as well as to the Act we have under consider­
ation here,
The respondent seems to be arguing that, what Congress
ought to have done is to have defined racketeering as it did
in section 1961 and then to have made that kind of activity
punishable either generally because it found that all racketeer
ing affects; interstate commerce or only insofar as it affects
interstate commerce.

But Congress simply did not. do that.

The legislative history does not reflect an intent to do that
aid certainly the language of the Act does not relfect any such
intent.
Furthermore, the purpose which respondent is suggest­
ing the limitation of an Act is required, the purpose of keep­
ing the fee=ral government from intruding into the areas of
state concern is in no way served by limiting this Act to
racketeer inj.

It simply will not have the purpose of screening

out cases «here there is no very strong or very great federal
interest as it might ba defined by individual judges o:
justices.
Indeed, we think, as the questions indicated by the
Court today, that this is a case with very strong federal in­
terest.

But at least as the Ninth Circuit construes the Act

43

with the racketeering requirement, this case falls outside of
the scope of -the Hobbs Act, so we think it is not a sensible
limitation to limit the incursion on state jurisdiction and
there is no support for it in the language or in the legislative
history wh:.ch is detailed fully in our brief*
Thank you.
