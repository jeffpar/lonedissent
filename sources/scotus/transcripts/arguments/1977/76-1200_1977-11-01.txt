MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 76-1200, Crist v. Cline and. Brats.
Mr. Keller, you raav proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. KELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the

Court:
Jurisdiction has been reserved in this case, a double
jeopardy case proceeding out of Montana, and we are proceeding
under the provisions of 28 United States Codie 1254(2).
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in effect held that
Montana statute 95-1711, taken from the Mode»! Penal Code, was
unconstitutional.

1711 permits a retrial if the first trial has

been terminated before the first witness is sworn, as distin­
guished from the federal rule that when a jury is empanelled and
sworn.
Sane of the facts in this case that give rise to the
jurisdiction of the Courts

This proceded

in 1974 in a nine-

count information against BretK and Cline and Mrs. Cline, but
she is not relevant to this appeal.

One of the counts and one

of the gut counts was obtaining money by false pretenses
alleged to have occurred between January and February of 1974.
After the jury was empanelled and sworn, the
defendants moved, made several motions, but motions to confine

4
the stata to the confines of the information of January and
February 1974, and unfortunately a typographical error, it
should have been January 1973 to February 197 4,

It put the

trial judge in a dilemma, for two reasons»
The state moved, to amend to correct the error, and I
bring this up because Justice Tuttle, in the Ninth Circuit,
commented that this was just simply a formal defect.
The trial judge was in this dilemma:

To permit the

amendment meant you were talking an additional year of time
against which the defendant had to defend at the last minute?
and, secondly, in 1973 the Montana Legislature enacted a compre­
hensive sweeping Montana Criminal Code of 1973 that repealed
all preexisting substantive lav; effective January 1, 1974.

So

in essence they were going to court on this particular count
--- there were three cotints, but this particular one — on an
offense that had been repealed before it was alleged to have
been committed.

So the trial court was in a real dilemma and

sua sponte dismissed the three counts that had the typographical
error.
The state, as I indicated, had moved to amend, and
this had been strenuously objected to by the defendants, and
that is when the court sua sponte dismissed.

They then dis­

missed the remaining six counts, the state did on it3 own
motion, and rofiled a new information, corrected the defect,
and filed a two-count information.

The first count was grand

5
larceny, and it tracked one of the six counts that the state
had moved tc dismiss of its own motion, and the second count
was obtaining money by false pretenses, with the typographical
error corrected, and the jury found — and there was a new
trial — the jury found the defendants guilty of this obtaining
money by false pretenses, one of the counts that had the typo­
graphical error„
QUESTIONS

Mr. Keller, we postponed the question of

whether or not we have appellate jurisdiction of this case
until the arguments on the merits, rather than nothing probable
jurisdio f ion.
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
I gather that your opponent, the appellee,

now concedes that there is appellate jurisdiction and you
apparently think so, but you don’t discuss it in your brief,
except to say that —
MR. KELLER:

My opening paragraph is tha jurisdiction,

that's correct, Your Honor, and ordinarily 1 would say that
that is my position, that you are correct, except that in one
of the appellee’s briefs, Breta1 brief, they contest our juris­
diction, saying that we didn’t address the question, and so I
felt that under the rules I had to address it both in the
opening shot in my brief and in the opening shot in oral argu­
ment.

If we are all satisfied in jurisdiction, then I want to

assure the Court that I’m satisfied that we are under 1254(2).

6
QUESTION:

Because the Court of Appeals has lie Id. in­

valid a statute of the State of Montana?
MR. KELLER:

That’s correct.

It never came right out

and said 1731 is unconstitutional, it -just said the Montana
Supreme Court, which v/as interpreting that statute, was wrong
and the effect of it is that it is unconstitutional.

Our

statute from the Model Penal Code specifically says that
jeopardy in essence hasn't attached.

You can have a retrial up

until the time the first witness is sworn, and the federal rule
in the federal system is at the time that the jury is empanelled
and sworn, so our statute is unconstitutional, as a result of
the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

That, is a sufficiently clear holding, that

it is unconstitutional.
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.
But, Ms:. Keller, your statute doesn't say

that there can be a trial up until the time the witness is
sworn.

It says there shall not ba a trial after the witness is

sworn.
MR. KELLER;
QUESTION:

That's correct.
So the statute literally doesn't do the —

isn't unconstitutional, is it?
MR. KELLER:

The Supreme Court interpretation in

Cunningham, State v. Cunningham, which was just prior to Bretz,
says just exactly what I have said, that the time jeopardy

7
attaches in Montana is at the time the first witness is sworn,
and they are construing so*. 95-1711, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

You think it is then the statute that per­

mits the — I still have some difficulty.

I can understand

that that is the rule in Montana, but I'm not quite sure that
there is a statute that is unconstitutional.
MR. KELLER:

Well, if our statute permits a retrial

on a termination of a case prior to the swearing of the first
witness but after the jury is empanelled and. sworn, then we have
a direct conflict with the federal system, and our Montana
Supreme Court, in tb.e Cunningham case, held just exactly that,
that this is no bar to a retrial, when

the Cunningham case was

dismissed after the jury was empanelled and sworn and before the
first witness liras sworn.

1 have to use Cunningham, and I am

sure you are familiar with it in the brief because it was a
part of the consolidated petition for a writ, of habeas corpus
that led to where we are now in this case.
X

QUESTION:

What I am trying to suggest is that per­

haps the legislature could have repealed the statute, so you
didn’t have a statute on the books, and the Montana Supreme
Court might nevertheless have made precisely the same holding,
then there wouldn’t be any —- just say the matter of Montana
law, jeopardy does not attach until the witness is sworn.
don’t think you would have an unconstitutional statute.
MR. KELLER:

I see your point.

I

8
QUESTION':

You have to argue that by implication#

when the Montana statute says retrial may be had under certain
circumstances -- may not be had under certain circumstances, yet
impliedly authorizes retrial under the circumstances where it
doesn’t prohibit it.
MR. KELLER:

Exactly.

That is our position, yes.

And.

the point that we are here on today was addressed head-on and
directly in the Cunningham case, when appellee's petition for a
writ to the Montana Supreme Court# it was summarily denied,
citing the Cunningham case, and it comes directly to this point
and puts us in the conflict that we are.
QUESTION:

So that is the meaning of your statute as

authoritatively construed by the highest court of your state?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Yes, sir.

Thank you„

MR. KELLER:

Going directly then past that to the

argument itself, we agree that the double jcsopardy prohibition
in the Fifth Amendment affects both under the federal system and
the state system.

We don't have any quarrel with that.

We

agree that there is a point in time at which jeopardy does
attach, and the reason that we are here is we don’t agree with
the point in time that has been set for it.
So the question we have for the Court is the point in
time selected in the federal system, at the time that the jury
is empanelled and sworn, mandated by the Constitution.

9
QUESTION:

Mr. Keller, let me* before you get. too

deeply into this, ask you, do I understand that Clina has won a
reversal of his conviction?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:
this.

Yes, sir.

After the petition for —■

Isn't the case moot as to him then?
I don’t really think so, and I don’t know

My opponent, Mr. Leaphart, represents him and was there

for the trial and it may well be that it is not moot.

I never

raised it and I didn’t raise it because it is conceivable that
the ultimate reversal by the Montana Supreme Court may permit
him to ba retried anyhow.

They are the ones on his appeal that

reverse! and set aside the conviction.
QUESTION:

But they had the indictment dismissed,

didn't they?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

I don’t know that.
It seems to me that he won everything in

the state appeal that he could possibly get in the habeas.
MR. KELLER:

I can only say this, as the one entrusted

with the prosecution, we don’t intend to reprosecute in that
case, but I don’t know whether it is moot or not.

The position

of both Cline and Brets were identical and it made no difference
to me if Cline came along or didn't come along.

The issue is

there and it is certainly there with Brets, so I didn’t explore
it at all.

It was raised for the first time by the Solicitor

General in his b:sief in this Court and, as a little bit of

10
background , the Attorney General's office of the State of
Montana was brand new to all of this as of January of this year
and none of us was there when this all took place.

Both the

counsel of the appellees were there throughout it all, so they
could probably more promptly answer that.
The first question that we have is the point in time
selected in the federal system mandated by the Constitution,
The ancillary question is, if it isn’t, do we still have to
follow it in our state under the doctrine of incorporation.
Historically, and this is conceded in appellees’
brief, that the common law of jeopardy wasn"t a problem until
there hail been a conviction or an acquittal,, and at the time of
the drafting of the Constitution this was the state of the com­
mon law,,
And I have looked frankly for the source of the federal
rule that commences at the time that the jury is empanelled and
sworn, and the closest I can ecme to any suggestions to you. is
there was a real problem for government appeals up until the
Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, and the language in the Criminal
Appeals Act was such that it permitted a writ, of error to be
pursued inter alia from the decision or judgment sustaining a
special plea in bar when the defendant has not been put in
jeopardy, but we don’t know when that point was as such.
The general rule at that time in the textbooks and
encyclopedias was at the time that the jury had been empanelled

11
and sworn.

But the minority view gave a distinction of after

conviction or acquittal.

There was a dichotomy that gave

nothing in between.
So the point that we are raising now had really never
been touched, then.
The othersuggestion that I have is going back to Peres
in 1824, which we have always contemplated as being the start
of manifest necessity.

If you read it, and as you recall --

and I’m sure you do from yesterday's argument.

this was a case

where there was a hung jury, so all of the evidence was in and
the case was all over, and Justice Story in a terse opinion is
faced with the dilemma what are you going to do when the jury —
you've got a jury and you can’t get rid of it, you've got to do
something and somehow, as you read that opinion, in essence, it
says, giving rise to manifest necessity after the jury is there
and they can’t arrive at something, there is a manifest neces­
sity to meet the ends of justice.
And from that I have to assume — and, as you all
know, we had a pretty liberal interpretation for a long, long
time of what is manifest necessity — I have; to believe that
nobody worried about what occurred after the jury was empanelled
and sworn, and that just gradually evolved, this cut-off point.
It never was a problem as such.

This Court never even

addressed it until 1963, and that was in Downum, so we've got a
long period of time before the issue even comes up.

And Downum

12
was not only handled as a manifest necessity case — the issue
I am raising wasn't raised, and it was a federal case, to boot.
So nobody questioned when Downum just simply came out and said
jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn, empanelled and sworn
in a jury case,
QUESTION:

Of course, it was not until .1969 that this

question could have possibly arisen ~™
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Exactly.
— because it wasn't until then, in the

Benton case, that the double jeopardy protection applicable to
the states —
MR. KELLER:

It goes to the states, exactly, and that

is the first time that it really had come to a confrontation.
Illinois v. Somraerville is 1973, and that is a state case, but
unfortunately for our position, it is a state that has identical­
ly the same rule as the federal rule.

So Justice Tuttle com­

ments in his opinion that there-: wasn't a shred of evidence
that that distinction made a difference to this court in its
opinion in 1973, and I submit that I don't know of any reason
why it would have been raised.

I don't know why Illinois would

raise it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Keller, you said you made an effort to

■ find the origin and history of the federal rule of the point
made when the jury is empanelled and sworn, what is the history
of your statute in your state?

Do you know?

13
MR. KELLER:
of it, Judge.

It was adopted in 1969, is my recollection

It came out of the Model Penal Code, and there

was a tentative draft in 1956 and a final draft in 1962.

The

tentative draft in 1956 has just this terse comment that they
see no difference between a jury and a non-jury for the point
that jeopardy attaches, and nothing better than that, but at
least it explains why they did it, but nothing behind, it.
QUESTION':

Do you know what other states or how many

other states, if any, have the same —
MR. KELLER:
know of the other.
into a quagmore.
Code.

I know only of two for sure, and I don"t

We tried to research for that point and ran
I know that Kentucky has from the Model Penal

Arizona did, and I don't know if they still do.

New York

did, and they just now held their own statute unconstitutional
following the federal rules, so I don't know if I want to cite
that as authority.

And Pennsylvania had something comparable

to it but not from the Penal Code.

And beyond that I have no

idea.
One of the reasons for it is in going through state
statutes, the way this thing is drafted., you have to look for a
negative, you can't find something as to when does jeopardy
attach.

You have to go read several statutes to come back to

find out what it does mean in that state.

But I do know for

sure that there are two others along with us today that have it.
QUESTION:

Kentucky and --

14
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION;
MR. SELLER:

Arizona.
Arizona.
The Sommerville case , in any event,

followed down and just said, without giving a reason — as I am
sure you have noted in the brief, we have emphasized this
throughout — never has there been a reason given for the rule
that is involved in the federal court, and there was no, as you
pointed out, no reason to question until Benton.

But the

language in Serf ass in 197 5 is significant to us, and I don't
want to be cut of line of trying to quote something that was
said that is out of context.

But the defense has relied upon

Serfass because it followed Sommerville and it followed Downum.
We rely upon it because now for the first tine the Court has
really looked at the point at which jeopardy attaches.

And as

you recall in Serfass, this was a point in time prior to even
having the jury empanelled.

So the comments are somewhat

relevant, but I don’t want to take advantage of them.

Neverthe­

less, eight of you concurred on this opinion, and this is what
we read from it as an aid, as an aid to the decision of cases
in whieh the prohibition of the double jeopardy clause has
been invoked.
The courts have found it useful to define a point in
criminal proceedings at which the constitutional purposes and
policies are implicated bv resort to the concept of attachment
of jeopardy.

And it goes on to say in a jury case, when a jury

15
is empanelled

and sworn in a non-jury when the first witness

is sworn.
The Court has consistently adhered to the view that
jeopardy does not attach and the constitutional prohibition cars
have no application until a defendant is put to trial before
the trier of the facts, whether the trier be a jury tar a judge.
The constitutional policies underpinning the Fifth
Amendment5s guarantee are not implicated before that point in
•the proceedings at which jeopardy attaches.

As we have noted

above, the Court has consistently adhered to the view that
jeopardy does not attach until a defendant is put to -trial
befoi’e the trier of the facts.
This is by no means a mere technicality, nor is it a
rigid mechanical rule.

It is, of course, like most legal

rules, art attempt to impart content to an abstraction, and you
can appreciate why we like this language.
Without risk of a determination of guilt, jeopardy
does not attach, and neither an appeal nor further prosecution
constitutes double jeopardy, and that, is specifically our point.
We take the position that, as a matter of law, no
jeopardy attaches until the witness says something incriminating.
If at the time the jury was empanelled and sworn, the prosecu­
tion rested, as a matter of law the case would have to be dis­
missed.

If at the time that the first witness is sworn

the

prosecuti.on rested, the case as a matter of law would have to he

16
dismissed.

It really means that in terms of when jeopardy at­

taches , that it varies with each case.
homicide may be a pathologist»

The first witness in a

He doesn't have anything to do

with guilt, he just wants to identify the corpus dilecti.

So

somewhere in there there is a risk of determination of guilt.
Our position is that our point in time is sooner than
jeopardy actually attaches, and the federal system is even
sooner than our point in time, and it is an aid to the court,
just exactly as Serfass said that it was, an aid to the court
that we tise.
QUESTION:

If we were to follow or adopt your reason­

ing on this point, it wouldn't change the rule in the federal
system, would it?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

I think that it would, and. —
In other words, you are saying that as a

matter of constitutional law, your concept of jeopardy is part
of the bill of rights and incorporates the double jeopardy
clause and that it. would be applicable both in the federal and
the state system?
MR. KELLER:

That's correct.

The only reason I

answer your question in the affirmative is the Criminal Appeals
Act in essence permits the government to proceed before jeopardy
attaches.

It doesn't have a cutoff date, such as ours dees.

Ours is prior to the first witness being sworn.
the language before jeopardy attaches.

Yours is in

It has been assumed, I

17
have to believe# that this has always been when the jury was
empanelled and sworn.

If this Court now adopts our rationale#

I have to assume that the government would be able to proceed
in a federal case up to at least the time the first witness is
sworn o
QUESTION:

But you would also be assuming# would you

not# that when Benton v„ Maryland said that double jeopardy
was incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, it met all of
the bag and baggage of the federal prohibition, rather than
just the general outline of it?
MR. KELLER:
has been espoused.

Yes, I understand that is a view that

I don*t support the view, no.

I believe

that that said we have the double jeopardy prohibition under the
Fourteenth, just as you do in the federal system, but I don't
believe that that means we have to take the rule, as Justice
Tuttle put it, the supervisory rules of the court as a consti­
tutional mandate.

So we have to take the double jeopardy pro­

hibition as a fundamental guarantee under Benton, but I don't
think it means we have to take the rules that went along.
QUESTION:

Therefore it is conceivable at least,

isn't it, in line with my brother Rehnquist’s question, that
the Court might hold that the Constitution tolerates the
Montana rule without at the same time holding that it requires
the federal rule to be the same?
MR. KELLER:

Yes.

18
QUESTION:

In other words, the Court has held that

the guarantee of a jury trial under the Federal Constitution
guarantees

s

12-member jury in federal cases, but tolerates a

smaller jury in state cases, state criminal cases?
MR. KELLER:

I'm with you.

My problem in answering

your question is I was a step ahead of you.

My colleague

already posed the question as we ware getting ready for this,
so we had gone one step further and expect some enterprising
government lawyer to bring one up, if you go our way, that
after the jury is empanelled and sworn before the first witness
is sworn and, within our limited knowledge, I didn't know how
to stop him, so I just really wasn't answering your question.
QUESTION:

What do you suggest happens significantly

between the empanelling of the jury and the swearing of the first
witness?
MR. KELLER:

Nothing.

I mean I went to a matter of

law and not as a matter of pracfci e, and nothing significant
happened.

As a matter of practice, the federal district judges

in our state just before they swear that jury, now wa hear
everything that has to be heard and get rid of these motions,
because under the federal system once a jury is sworn we start.
At the state level, we have until the first witness is sworn to
get rid of and dispose of all these things.

As a matter of

practice, nothing can be done to that jury as a matter of law
within those two periods of time that can have an effect upon

19
the defendant.
QUESTION:

Well* what about the opening statement of

the prosecution?

He can do that, but what does that do in

And they made it

The last thing they wanted was

That puts them at a recii disadvantage.

So

20
when they make the motion that they made in the manner that they
made it, it truly was ingenius because they have got jeopardyattaching under the federal rule and they still can make their
motion before they have commenced under the state rule.
I really locked for a basis for this, and the only
thing that I can find that is -- I really don't like to use the
word "weakness” in our position, but that 1 guess for the lack
of a better phrase — a weakness, the only weakness I can come
to is the valued right concept, and the valued right concept has
been espoused.

It has been espoused by Members of this Court

as recently as 1973.
I want to submit that the valued right is a valued
right to get the case fried, as distinguished from the valued

right to this particular jury.

In fact, if you take the position

that it is a valued right to this particular tribunal, then
somehow it puts this Court in a position of saying that the de­
fendant has a constitutional right to a defect in the system.
The only way that you can have a jury that is not impartial is
because of a defect in the selection.

The whole process is

geared to an impartial jury.
Now, all of us know as trial lawyers that you can have
a good or bad jury, you can have a feeling that you have a good
or bad jury, but that is not quite the same thing as the United
States Supreme Court espousing that you have a constitutional
right to a defect in the system, to a good or bad jury, and for

21
that
QUESTION:

Is that a fair statement of their argument?

Couldn't you phrase it just the other wayr that the defendant
aiight be convinced that he has a good and impartial, fair jury
but the prosecutor wants to have twelve more peremptory channels
so he dismisses the prosecution to try to get a better jury from
the prosecutor t standpoint?
MR- KELLER:

Well, now you are talking prosecutory

manipulation, Justice Stevens,

and that was met head-on by

Justice Haswell, of the Montana Supreme Court.

If what you are

talking about, is prosecutorial manipulation, that makes no dif­
ference whether the jury has been empanelled and sworn or the
first witness is sworn.

If I as a prosecator can manipulate to

get to this point, I can ask for my dismissal before you swear
the jury.

So the point that they Eire raising doesn't really get

to the difference in point of time.

This time to do the prose-

euatorial manipulation is just as valid in the federal system as
it is in the state system.

We first have to assume that the

prosecutor is manipulating, that the trial judge hasn’t caught
it, and ha can do it just as effectively in the federal system
as they are suggesting it can be done in the state system.
QUESTION t
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

Immediately before the jury is sworn —
The. t ’ s r ight.
— and you know who the jurors will be?
Exactly, and you just exhaust it all and

22
you know right then, this doesn't look like a hangraan1 s jury,
maybe we better get rid of it and try twelve more, and that point
in time is just as valid before you swear that jury as it is
when the first witness is sworn.
I really think the valued right concept, and it was
expressed as policy's underpinning in one of your opinions.
Justice White, this point go both to speedy trial and double

jeopardy, and the right as such is the right to get the case
tried.

But it. doesn't put the valued right to get the case tried,

eight now quite in the point of a constitutional right.

Cer­

tainly, be has a constitutional right under speedy trial, and
there are overtones from that in this situation, but that puts

as back to tie question of what kind of passage of time are we
talking about, as between just before the jury is sworn and just
before the

first witness is sworn.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
QUESTION:

May I ask you before you sit down, you in

your brief seem to have abandoned the argument on manifest
necessity.
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
Let’s assume you are wrong on your thought

that it isn't properly here, it isn’t properly subject to
appellate jurisdiction here.

Assume you are wrong on that.

Do

you mean -- would you mean to abandon it or not?
MR. KELLER:

Yes, sir.

I am compelled to answer yes on

23

the standard of manifest necessity.
QUESTION:

Under what case?

MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Under what case?
Yes.

MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Well —
Where do you abandon it?

MR. KELLER::

Because our whole thrust of the Montana

statute when we came in in taking over this prosecution, I think
that tha manifest necessity was raised for the first time by
federal district Judge Bratton when this case was heard, and I
don’t — in my mind, I don't believe that the state even raised
it at the outset.
QUESTION:

So you don't think it has ever been pre­

sented to the Montana Supreme Court?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

It has not, no.
So there has been —* well, is there any

necessity for that in
MR. KELLER:

Any necessity for raising it to the

Montana Supreme Court?
QUESTION:

In a federal habeas corpus proceeding, is

there any iacessity for you to have, in order to argue manifest
necessity, to have it gone through the state system?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
the state,, is there?

No, I don't think £30.
There is no

requirement for exhaustion on

24
MR. KELLERS

That’s right.

No, there is no require­

ment on the state.
QUESTION:

Well, why do you say that the manifest

necessity isn’t properly here?
MR. KELLER:
the one that I gave.

I had two reasons, frankly, and one is
I think from the outset that the state has

-taken the position prior to my time that their concern about the
statute and this point, in time —
QUESTION:

Well, if you just don’t want to raise it,

that may be so, but if you lose — what if you lose on the
statute?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Then I have lost.
Then you don't want us to consider, you

just don’t want that issue of manifest necessity adjudicated
here, is that, it?
MR. KELLER:
second point.

That's correct, yes.

So that is the

I think that we are grossly weak on manifest

necessity and —
QUESTION:

Well, of course, that is ultimately a de­

cision for this Court, not for you.
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
under Lee.

Well, I didn't intend to pursue it. Judge.
So you don't think it is worth anything

Did you read Lee, the Lee case?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
you don’t think it is worth anything under

25
Lee?
MR. KELLER-

We 'were asked by the Solicitor General to

move for a continuance before we had to first file anything so
that Lee could come down in time before we got to -- before we
even presented our brief, and at that time made the decision
that we were going to proceed on the issue

that we felt was

there from the outset, and not manifest necessity, so our brief
was in before the opinion came doxim in Leca.
Now, I am summarizing a lot of things, but we had a
pretty in-depth discussion with the Solicitor General and the
facts in our case, and all I can say is that was also a factor
in deciding not to —
QUESTION;

Wall, he doesn’t seem to agree with you on

such a weak point.
MR. KELLER;

X have to concur with some of the points

made by counsel for Bretz.
QUESTION:

I don’t ~

He would sustain -- he would think there

was manifest necessity if the merits are reached here.
MR, KELLER:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Leaphart,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. WILLIAM LEAPHART, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE CLINE
MR. LEAPHART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue of mootnass has been raised, so I will direct
rayself to that initially.

The Solicitor General in his brief,

in a footnote on page 5, las noted the fact that Mr. Cline's
conviction was reversed by the Montana Supreme Court, and the
Solicitor expresses his opinion that Mr. Cline has received all
the relief that the writ of habeas corpus could provide.
I suggest to the Court that tliat assertion assumes
that the writ of habeas corpus statutes can clo nothing more than
effect the release of a man from prison, and I would direct the
Court's attention to this Court’s opinion in Karafas v. Lavelle,
?>91 U.S.

294, in which this issue of mootness was answered in

the —
QUESTION:

Well, before you get to that, I think you

Left out one point.

The Court not only reversed but also dis­

missed the charges.
MR. LEAPHARTs
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

That's a. little different from just a re­

versal.
MR. LEAPHART:

Well, I have no quarrel that the charges

27
:were dismissed, but it; —
QUESTION:

Well, what can the state do after that

under Montana state law?
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION s

Well, I maintain, Your Honor, that ■—

What can Montana do as to these charges

against this man after the Supreme Court of Montana dismisses
them?
MR. LEAPHART:

Okay.

Your Honor, at the first trial

that we are talking about that was aborted, there were nine
counts.

The state voluntarily dismissed one, the judge on his

own motion dismissed three more, and then the prosecution came
in and dismissed the remaining counts, came back and filed a twocount information, and we went to trial on that.
It is my position that Mr. Cline still has a very
vested interest in the determination as to whether or not
jeopardy attached at that first trial, because —
QUESTION;

Sven if they can't try him again?

Even if

■;hsy do not try him again?
MR. LEAPHART:
this appeal.

Well, Mr. Cline right now is defending

He has been named by the state as an appellee.

Mr. Keller's representation today that they clo not intend to
further pursue the matter is the first that I have ever heard

of that.

As his counsel, I have had to assume that, since they

are prosecuting the appeal, that they intend to pursue the
•.natter

28
QUESTION:

But you still haven’t told me how they can.

MR,. LEAP HART:

Well, what I arn saying, Your Honor, is

that there still are five counts remaining from that first
prosecution that, if jeopardy had not attached, conceivably the
state can come in and charge him on those five counts.

You see,

they only filed two counts the second time.
QUESTION:

So the conviction was only reversed on two

counts?

MR. LEAPHART:

That’s correct.

We still have five

counts that are kind of hanging there.
QUESTION:

But as it stands right now, he is clean

with the state, there are no charges pending against him?
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And there is no lingering consequences from

his conviction?
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

I thought you said charges ware dismissed

by the court.
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

Well, can they be retried?

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

Two, Your Honor»

No.

Well, where are these counts that they can

retry?
MR. LEAPHART:
we are talking about.

Well, we have two separate trials that
We started out with a nine-count

29

information which was knocked down to eight counts and then down
to five counts and then the prosecution dismissed those five and
came back anc only filed two.
QUESTION:

Well*, that is all there is.

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

Well —

There is no bar in Montana law for their

refiling those three counts?
MR. LEAP HART:
QUESTION:

Yes, the ones they dismissiad.

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

The remaining counts?

Pardon me?

The ones they dismissed, the ones the

prosecution dismissed,
MR. LEAPHART:

those three counts.
I think that it is .arguable, I think

that they could come in and try to refile them.
QUESTION:
filing them at all.

Well, they cculd -try to file them without
Under Montana law, charges that fare dis­

missed by a court can foe retried?
MR. LEAPHART:

No, six.

I am saying that there are

still five counts that were not dismissed by the court.
QUESTION:

Dismissed by the prosecutor?

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And has the statute of limitations run by

now?
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

No.

No, sir.

Under the Ninth Circuit's ruling, in effect,

30

/ou get a complete immunity on all nine counts, whereas you say
you are uncertain with respect to the results —
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

—- if it just depends on the decision of

the Supreme Court of Montana?
MR. LEAPHART:

We still have a lingering uncertainty

as to those remaining counts.
QUESTION:

And you say that is enough to justify

habeas?
MR,, LEAPHART:

I think so.

And I would further submit

to the Court that should this Court declare that Mr. Cline's
position is moot, that the effect of that decision is to say
that a double jeopardy, a parson whose double jeopardy rights
have been violated only has a remedy if he has been convicted.
And I think the double jeopardy protection is bj^oader than that.
It protects the man from having to stand trial twice, not just
be convicted.
QUESTION:

Well, where is he standing trial twice here?

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:
/our point?

Well —

I suppose you don't know yet.

Isn't that

You. don1 t know, that he may be charged again?

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That is what concerns you?

MR. LEAPHART:

That's correct.

Well, assuming my po­

sition is correct on the merits of this case, jeopardy did

31
attach at that first trial, then we have stood trial twice.
have gone through two trials.

We

1 am projecting an uncertainty

about a third trial, that they could come back in and refile on
those remaining five counts,, and which in fact it would be a
third trial.
QUESTION;

There ..is no threat of that at all?

MR. LEAPHARTs

Well, other than the fact that I am

here —
QUESTION;

In addition, wa have this statement from the

Attorney General that he will not do it.
MR. LEAPHART;
QUESTION;

You do have that,

1 -—

Where is the threat, that the next Attorney

General might do .it or his grandson may do it?
MR. LEAPHART:

Well, Your Honor, my position is that

the fact that I am here defending this appeal to ma indicates
that they are still pursuing this matter, and this is the first
that I have heard that they do not intend to reprosecute.
QUESTION;

I don't think that both of you by agreement

would give us jurisdiction* if it is not hero.
MR. LEAPHART;
Your Honor.

Well, I think the jurisdiction is there,

The issue has been raised.

Mr. Cline was in custody

at the tine the District Court assumed jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

But as of now he is not in custody, he is

.not subject to trial —
MR. LEAPHART;

Well, I think —

32
QUESTION:
way, I suppose»

May I ask a similar question much the same

Habeas corpus is a collateral attack on a judg­

ment .
MR» LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»

What judgment is outstanding as being col­

laterally attacked by your client?
MR, LEAPHART:

I think the answer to that, Your Honor,

is that we have to put this in the context of the jurisdiction
attaching in the Federal District Court.
QUESTION:

It attached as to a judgment which has now

been set aside.
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Now these five other counts have never been

reduced to judgment, have they?
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Hovr can they provide the basis for a col­

lateral attack?
MR. LEAPHART:

My answer. Your Honor, is that in this

Court, in the Serfass decision, said that once habeas jurisdic­
tion —
QUESTION:

I understand that case, there was a judgment

outstanding that was involved in the appeal.

The judgment sur­

vived the service of his sentence, but that doesn't hold that you
can attack a nonexistent judgment.

MR. LEAPHART:

Well —

33

QUESTION:

A judgment entered by a court.

MR. LEAPHART:

In a double jeopardy context, Your

Honor, the fact still remains that my client had to stand trial
twice.
QUESTION:

~ for a related offense to which you would

say that is really encompassed within what you have been acquitted
of or something like that.

There is always a possibility of

somebody indicting you and you making a plea in abatement or a
plea in bar, claiming double jeopardy, but the Court has never
found that a basis for collateral attack that. I know of.
MR. LEAPHART:

Well, I would submit that I am not

merely engaging in speculation when I am defending th:.s appeal
by the State of Montana, the state which has already tried my
C!lient twice and still has five, outstanding counts that unless
jeopardy attaches they can refile.
QUESTION:

In any event, I suppose the issue will be

presented by the other case for resolution —
MR. LEAPHART?

I submit that my client has a very sig­

nificant interest.
QUESTION:

Apart from your client’s interests —

MR. LEAPHARTYes.
QUESTION:

— the basic issue will be settled in the

other case.
MR. LEAPHART:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, as to the merits of the ease, Mr. Keller throughout

34
this litigation has maintained that there are no constitutional
policies underlying the federal rule, the rule announced by
this Court in Downum v. United States.

He has taken the; position

that the Montana rule offers as much protection to a defendant
as does the Downum rule.
On the contrary, l would submit to the Court that his­
torically the Downum rule has protected two basic interests,,
First of all# it protects the defendant from having a judge or a
prosecutor dismiss a case when it becomes apparent to either one
of them that a conviction is going to be unlikely? and, secondly,
it protects, it. insures the defendant that he can proceed to
trial before a particularly chosen tribunal.
Now, both of these interests are best served by having
jeopardy attach at an early stage in the trial proceeding.

And

the point at which jeopardy attaches, as has been pointed out in
the SOmmerville decision, merely begins the inquiry as to whether
or not there are double jeopardy interests involved.

The mere

fact that it is attached does not necessarily mean that the de­
fendant's double jeopardy interests are going to prevail.
For example, in the Sommerville case, the interests in
sound judicial administration and the ends of public justice
were the prevailing factors# and so it is just a matter of bal­
ancing those interests out.
The problem with moving the point of attachment to a
.Later stage in the proceeding is that you then create a period

35
of time during which the prosecutor can ask for a mistrial or a
dismissal and he can do so without making any showing of mani­
fest necessity or extraordinary circumstances.
QUESTION:

Of courses, there is still the factor of the

sound judicial discretion of the trial judge as to whether to
grant it* so you are not without protection.
MR. LEAPHART:

That's correct, Your Honor, but I don't

think that there is sufficient protection because the trial judge
doesn't have the guidelines that are brought into play by the
attachment of jeopardy.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that there is some really

imperative need — I am not sure what manifest necessity means,
that there is some significant element of the; administration of
justice that requires the federal and the state timeframe to be
the same?
MR. LEAPHART:

Well, what I am flaying is that I think

that the attachment of jeopardy rule protects essentially two
interests?

number one, protecting the defendant's right to pro­

ceed before a particular tribunal; and, secondly, insuring that a
judge or a prosecutor cannot dismiss when they think that a con­
viction is unlikely without showing manifest necessity.

And I

think that that is sufficiently protected under the Downum rule.
And what 1 am saying is if you move the point in time, as Montana
has done,

then you start to jeopardize those two interests, be­

cause as you pointed out, during that period of time you have got

36

such things as the opening statement of the prosecutor, and,
more importantly# you've got the possibility of an opening
statement by the defense counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, I am not arguing or suggesting or

intimating that one or the other is better.

I am simply saying

is there any need that the federal rule bind all the fifty
states as to this time factor?
MR. LEAPHART:

Well, I think if wa are going to make

any sense out of double jeopardy protection in the states,
there is.,

If we open the door, if the Court opens the door and

allows the states to adopt their own rules as to when jeopardy
attaches, then conceivably the State of Montana is free to adopt
a rule such as the common law rule, that jeopardy doesn't
attach until the jury verdict comas in, and I don't think that
anybody is going to argue that that is going to protect the
interests which become associated with double jeopardy protec­
tion.
I think that this Court has specifically said in the
Jorn case that that point in time represents a point in time
at which time constitutional policies come into play, and I
think it —
QUESTION:

That was a federal case, wasn't it, Jorn?

MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:
plurality opinion?

Yes, sir.

But I should point out —

Was Jorn a Court opinion or was it just a

37
MR. LEAPHART:

Plurality.

I should point out that this Court in Illinois v.
Sommer ville and in Breed v. Jones has applied the Domum rule
to the State of Illinois and the State of California.
QUESTION:

It is clear, is it not, that in the federal

system, .in a non-jury trial, jeopardy attaches — does not
attach until after the first witness is sworn?
MR.» LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That is clear?

MR. LEAPHART:

I think so, yes, sir.

I think a dis­

tinction between the jury and the non-jury trial is that, in
terms o:: practice, in a non-jury trial most often if there is a
mistrial or a dismissal and it is refiled, it comes back in
front of the same judge, which is the same tribunal» so you
haven't jeopardized the defense.
QUESTION:

That is really not. necessarily so in many

instances.
MR. LEAPHART:

1 know it is not necessarily so, but

in Montana, as a matter of practice, I think it is; whereas, in
a jury trial, once you have a dismissal or a mistrial, the
second time around you've got an entirely new tribunal.
QUESTION:

In Montana, does the judge impose the sen­

tence?
MR. LEAPHART:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Well, don't some of your double jeopardy

considerations then apply even to a bench trial?

I am thinking

now of the opening statement, stress and anxiety, the possible
impression upon the trier of a fact.
MR. LEAPHART:

Your question, Your Honor, are they

affecting the tribunal or the trier of fact?
QUESTION:

Wouldn't all of those considerations tend

to cane to rule that jeopardy attaches before the first witness
is sworn?
MR. LEAPHART:

Yes.

In fact, I think a very good

argument can be made for having jeopardy attach at an earlier
time.
QUESTION:

I am just not following you on trying to

draw the distinction between the two is all.
MR. LEAPHART :

The counsel for the appellant —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Go ahead and respond.

We

will extend your time by two minutes, in view of our excessive
large questioning.
MR. LEAPHART:

The counsel for the appellant has put

forth really only one rationale for the Montana rule, and that
is that the jury prior to the swearing of the first witness has
nothing to consider.

There are essentially at least three

fallacies with that argument, I submit, because, number one, the
jury does have something to consider prior to the swearing of
the first witness.

It has the — the jury has the opening

statement: of the prosecutor, possibly the opening statement of

39
the defease counsel.

And 1 was listening to the argument in

Court hare yesterday

on the propriety of remarks made during

voir dire and opening statements, and so that is another
element, questions that come out during voir dire which affect
the jury,
QUESTION;

Well, damaging statements made during the

jury selection process, unless you have a trial judge who is
going to protect the case, are beyond the reach of double
j eopardy, ar en# t they?
MR. LEAP HART;
just damaging statements.

Your Honor, I am thinking of more than
I am thinking of things of — often­

times a defense counsel will ask jurors what their thoughts are
if a defendant chooses not to taka the stand, and try to feel
them out on that point, and he is tipping his ha ml to the
prosecution as to the approach he is going to take in the case.
QUESTION;

How about pretrial publicity that occurs

a month before the case is set for trial?

That can have some

influence on the jury, and surely you wouldn't argue that
jeopardy attaches a month before the case is set for trial.
MR. LE&PHART:

No, I would have a difficult time argu­

ing the jeopardy should attach any time prior to the point
where we actually know what the composition of the jury panel
is, before we have actually chosen the tribunal.
QUESTION:

In this case, the opening statement had not

MR. LEAPHART:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Moses.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. MOSES, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE BRETZ
MR. MDSES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In the argument presented before this Court, there
was an issue raised that I would like to respond specifically
to.

In Benton v. Maryland, the Court said that the same con­

stitutional standards apply against both the state and the
federal government.
As I see this case, this is an effort to spin off the
non-constitutional baggage of the Benton decision.
way I see it.

That is the

In other words, we are trying to create a non­

constitutional parsing of what Benton v. Maryland has said.
Now, that may be fine but I think that is what the
issue is as I see it.

We are trying to say that it is a non-

constitutional issue as to how this Constitution should be ap­
plied in the State of Montana.

I see that as the issue.

Now, I don't think that is a valid theory.

I don’t

think the State of Montana, either legislatively or judicially,
should be examining decisions of the Supreme Court of the

41
United States to determine what is non-constitutional baggage
in terms of time.

The Suprerne Court applies the rule, it de­

cides when the constitutional rule should be applied, and the
states and the legislatures should follow it, in my judgment.
Now, the question is also raised as to whether there
is any significant difference as to the time when jeopardy at­
taches.

I think it is a very important question.

Let me

suggest one point to you before I approach that question, and
that is the burden of proof.
It used to be -- and perhaps I am adopting front the
equal protection cases -- the rule of compelling state interests
or at least soma rational rule.

What we are doing here is not

justifying the — the state is not up here justifying and say­
ing there is some compelling need not to have this rule that
has been announced in Downum and Sommerville and all of the
rest,

there is some compelling reason in the State of Montana

why we should not have this rule.
So when we talk about the difference, I don’t want to
be on the defensive by simply saying to you that maybe I can
satisfy you as to the significant difference, and maybe I can’t.
QUESTION:

I thought all statutes were presumed con­

st! tut iona1, counse1?
MR. MOSES:

That is,all statutes are presumed con­

stitutional , but that is one of the problems we get.

If I may

just make a brief comment on that point, in the State of Montana

42
we had conclusive presumption contrary to Louie v. U.S. and the
teachings of the Supreme Court.

So that if we take the rule

in Montana that wa have a presumption to that effect, which is
conclusive, then we have presumptions which are again rollconstitutional issues.
You see, my point is that where the states in my
view, sir, we have that presumption, but if you were to apply
it in the State of Montana, you would find it conclusive and
the —•
QUESTION:

Well, certainly no one suggests that it is

a conclusive presumption, 180 years of decisions of this Court
show otherwise.
MR. MOSES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But you are talking about who the burden

of proof should be on as to unconstitutionality.
MR, MOSES:

Yes, I understand the point.

1 wanted to

make that extra point in that it is my judgment, that the State
of Montana does not follow at all the Supreme Court decision.
You are right, there is that presumption, but my understanding
is that if you are going to depart from the Constitution, you
must show some compelling reason for doing so.
QUESTION:

Well, you would have to

I would think if

you are going to depart from the Constitution, no showing would
justify it.
MR. MOSES:

Well, that is one of the issues that is

very narrowly drawn in this case, Your Honor, because if the
Supreme Court in Downura, Sommorville and all of those, if that
is an application of the Supreme Court, then the State of
Montana cannot change it, that is clear„

The issue in this

case seams to be as to whether we can take off a portion of what
the Court has said and say that that is non-constitutional
baggage.

Mow that is as X see it.
If it is a non-constitutional issue as to the time

when jeopardy attaches, then, of course, there isn't any sig­
nificance and, of course, the thing can apply.
When you talk about the question of whether there is
any significant difference, the question is whether you have a
valued right to have his -trial completed by a particular tribunal
That is IJ.S. v. Jorn and U.S. v.Lae, of course.

I think there

is some merit as to permitting the prosecution, the peremptory
challenge to the entire panel.

I think there is a lack of

reciprocity, parhaps like in For naris.
What I am saying to the Court X think is simply that
that issue was addressed to the Court in the issue by Mr.
Tuttle, Chief Justice Tuttle, in this particular manner, in
which he said on page 15, is that the valued right to have this
trial completed by a particular tribune! independent of the
threat of bad faith conduct by the judge or prosecutor — now,
I take that to mean that you are entitled to the double jeopardy
argument, regardless of whether the discretion of the court in

44
dismissing was in good faith or in bad faith.
And I think when we come to a valued right# the ques­
tion is simply is the person in jeopardy when the jury is
empanelled and sworn.

I think that he is.

I think the oppor­

tunity to have a peremptory challenge to the entire panel

in

our state we are now giving some preliminary instructions as to
what the law is in this particular case# we have opening state­
ments in which there are outlines of what they intended to
prove —
QUESTION:

Mr. Moses# on that point of peremptory

challenge to the entire panel, which concerned me before# under
Montana law does the prosecti tor have a right to have the prose­
cution dismiss after the jury is sworn but before the first
witness is sworn, or is it subject to permission by the trial
cour t?
MR. MOSESs

In my judgment# it is subject to permis­

sion by the trial court.

I do nob think he has an absolute

right# no# sir.
QUESTION:

Then his argument — I would be interested

in your response to this — his argument is that if you have a
prosecutor who seeks to manipulate by dismissing the panel# he
can do it equally before the swearing — equally before the
jury is sworn or immediately thereafter?
MR. MOSES:
Keller.

I think there is a point well made by Mr.

I think that is true# but I think it points out the

45
problems that we are having.

We are just taking another single

step down the line, but. the manipulation, ciooording to Justice
Tuttle,- the right here preserved is independent of the threat
of bad faith conduct by judge or prosecutor? whatever they do?
jeopardy is attached.
QUESTION:

I suppose a countervailing consideration

~ I was just trying to think it through ■— is that before you
really start questioning witnesses and the like, you do need a
point in the proceedings for a kind of clean-up of all outstand­
ing motions and odds arid ends which might involve a dismissal
or retrial or change in the date os an indictment or something
like that.

And isn't there some sense to saying that in orderly

procedure to have that corae right before you put the witness
on or before you make your opening statements, rather than
right in the midst of the jury selection process and before you
swear the jury?

Just the terms of an orderly way to get the

trial going, isn't there something to favor his argument here?
MR. MOSES

i

I don't think so, but I am not sure I

understand the point completely.

The pretrial motions and any­

thing that is done ordinarily is done before the selection of
the jury.

We had two judges to rule on these motions that we

urge and urge and urge.
QUESTION:

But isn't it true that in this case they

waited until after the jury was sworn before they presented
some motion which the judge regarded as timeless?

MR. MOSES;:
only.

Those motions were evidentiary in nature

What I do is that I present all of my pretrial motions,

1 argue them again and again, and at the time of the trial I
have the motions in limine.

Now, I could have waited.

There

It was not ingenius.

It was not the

My issue was at that time that

the entire nine counts did not state a claim for relief, and
they dismissed all of them hut two of them, and I still maintain, despite the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the first
count was never any good, and that was the issue, and I thought
that ought to be resolved because if you had to go on with the
case with the other five counts, then it is difficult under
Ash v. Swinson and Turner v. Arkansas to go back and try the
other issues that had been kicked out by the court.

And I put

that in my brief and addressed it to the attention of the
Attorney General and to the court, here is the dilemma, let's
move to the Supreme Court and get it all decided.

Those motions

Then I went into court after the jury had

keen empanelled and sworn to be consistent, all right, if that
is your view that they do state a cause of action, then my
motions were to require them to prove a venue as laid, to prove
that there were false and forged documents ~ those were the
nature of my objections, and also to confine them to the proof
of a particular time which I happen to think would not win.

But

48

the other motions ware what were important, preparing false
evidence, those motions in limine.
QUESTION:

That was what --

But the motion that precipitated the contro­

versy that is here today was to restrict the evidence to the
dates in the information, as I understand it.
MR. MOSES:

Well, they have extracted that.

From my

point of view, sir, that was not the vitality of the motions
that ware presented.

For instance, in Montana, you have to

show where the time is relevant or significant, and whether you
can prove it sometime prior to five years before the filing of
the complaint.

I really did not think that was that relevant.

I think it is necessary when they do not, when it is consistent
with our pretrial motions that ware argued vigorously and sup­
ported i:i our trial brief.

The effect of your motion was to bring

about a dismissal of the information?

I disagree with that, sir.

I do not believe it is, sir.

No, sir.

I think one of the — to conclude my argument, one of
the things that concerned me theoretically, if I may place it
in that light, is the question of raising non-constitutional
issues as a theory to be adopted by this Court.
For instance, I think Justice Stewart address atten­
tion to Williams v„ Florida and. Apodaca v. Oregon.

I think that is a difference and a dis­

There was somethign bag and baggage, that was a part

of double jeopardy as enunciated by this Supreme Court.

I think

that is a difference and a distinction in Williams v. Florida
and Apodaca.
Furthermore, if is my belief that there is a difference

50
because the application^ the court is called! upon the apply
this constitutional standard, and the question is when should
it be applied.

It is implicit in the constitutional provision

itself as to when it should be applied, and I think that that
makes it -- involves itself more than the issues raised on just
those issues.
For those reasons and others, we think that the de­
cision of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. KELLER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
QUESTION:

Mr. Keller, before you bagin, let me put

this question to you, relating to some questions I put earlier.
After the swearing of the jury in Montana, I take it, the
prosecutor is permitted to make the first opening statement if
he elects to do so, is that correct?
MR. KELLER:

Yes, sir.

Ordinarily there is a brief

statement mads by the trial judge before the jury is even voir
direct, to give them some concept as to why they are here, and
then the questions start.
QUESTION:

Well, I am addressing myself now to the

possible damage or injury to the defendant that can occur from
the opening statement.
MR. KELLER:

I see.

51
QUESTION;

If an opening statement, let's assume one

that is outrageously bad and misrepresentation by the prosecu­
tor , of course, the prosecutor isn't going to move for a mis­
trial on that ground, but the defense might do so, and I suppose
under Montana procedure and practice if the statement had been
if the opening statement had been excessively bad, the court
could grant that motion?
MR. KELLERS
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
And then there could be no double jeopardy

problem?
»

MR. KELLER;

I don't know about that.

But, yes, the

court could grant that motion.
QUESTION:

Well, if there was a motion at the request

of the defendant, the defendant would he in a rather difficult
position to raise double jeopardy.
MR. KELLER:

Well, his position I am sure, knowing

the talent that we have in Montana, will be that he was forced
to do this and it is double jeopardy, and I think there would
be some merit to that approach in the proper situation, but I
am sure that isn't why you asked the question.
to get that fra.

We don't need

Yes, if the conduct of the prosecutor were

outrageous, it would be the defense motion for a mistrial or
conceivably the court on its own motion granting a mistrial
just for this reason.

It wouldn't be too unlike yesterday's

case, only to spell out the reasons.

52
QUESTION?

Well, presumably if the court granted a

mistrial on its own motion, a double jeopardy question could
wall have been preserved.
MR. KELLER;

It would be much less likely —

If the defendant moved —

QUESTION:

if the defendant moved for it.

And, of

course, we would presume- that the prosecution isn't going to
move for it.
MR. KELLER;
QUESTION;

Not under those circumstances, no, sir.
Unless a senior officer happened to walk

in the courtroom and wanted to avoid the problem.
MR. KELLER;

Go ahead.

Well, just to respond to some of the

comments, we didn’t extract this part out of the motion in
limine.

This motion at that time, which at the time leaves the

state in the position of trying to convict for an offense that
was repealed a month before it is alleged to have taken place
isn't an extraction.

That went to the heart, of everything.

They had to do something with those three counts.
Part of the confusion that arose here is of the nine
counts, three were subject to the problem, so the judge dis­
missed them sua sponte.

The state dismissed of its own motion

the remaining six, and I think this was Mr. Leaphart's point,
that he :.s still sweating out.

Then on the retrial, one of the

defective counts and one of the counts the state dismissed
were all that were charged, so there are still five counts
sitting out, and I see what his point is and we don’t intend to

53
prosecuta.

But that isn't something we just brought up.

We

didn't know anything about this until —- it just cams out in
the Solicitor General's opinion, and this is the first time that
we have even thought about it — no, we won't.
The voir dire questions that were commented on is
true in both systems, federal or state.

If you are going to

talk about opening statements, that is fine, that can came up
under the state system, but if you are going to affect that jury
by your voir dire questions, you affect them under system, so
that is not a distinction between the two systems, if you want
to affect your juvy, because they are not empanelled and sworn
yet»
The valued right concept may be a valuable one, but I
would like to call the Court's attention that we don't see it
from this Court until 1948, in Wade,v. Hunter, and then we are
talking about a court martial.

In all candor with the Court,

Justice Douglas relied on Cornell, a lower court case of 1931,
that refers to the valued right.

In further candor, I found

the valued right as such clear back in United States v. Simmons,
United States v. Shumaker, and that is back in 1840, but nobody
said what, it was.

And the most that I have to feel it was,

because that is the overall concept, is let's get the case tried
now as distinguished from we have a right to this particular
tribunal.
The question of a judge trial in Montana needs to be

54

tempered a little bit by the fact that Montana has an extremely
liberal disqualification feature, so we can disqualify for no
reason either side one judge in a criminal case, two in a civil
case»

You don’t have that same rule in federal cases.

tough to get a federal judge disqualified.

It is

Does this mean if we

are going fcc adopt this as part of the constitutional baggage
that we now are going to have to he faced with what you can do
to disqualify a judge if you have a vested right to this judge
in a judge trial, I really don't mention it to complicate it,
but Montana is that way, going back to the wars of the copper
kings.

It is not hard getting rid of a judge in Montana in

either criminal or civil cases, and I don’t say that disrespect­
fully, with seven years on the bench.

I just know that it is

not hard to get rid of them.
The only other thing I have to conclude with the
argument is T. want to pose this questions

Suppose Congress in

1907, in the Criminal Appeals Act, had, instead of saying until
jeopardy attaches, had said when the first witness is sworn,
would that have been unconstitutional?

Would we be here today?

Suppose Congress today enacts legislation that says
in the federal system jeopardy doesn't attach until the first
witness is sworn, or in acts under the Model Penal Code?

Is

that unconstitutional?
Ani I think to me that that is the crux of the issue
here.

Thank you.
