MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in State of California against State of
Texas in an original jurisdiction case.
Mr. Falk, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME B. FALK, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. FALK:
please the Courts

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I should like to begin by identifying four

of the factors which prompted California to invoke this Court's
jurisdiction,,

for these same considerations in our judgment

snake the exercise of that jurisdiction appropriate and indeed
imperative.
The first consideration was the technical basis for
jurisdiction under Texas v. Florida, a point which, of course,
I will be elaborating upon throughout this argument, namely,
that the tax claims which have; been asserted by the various
taxing entities exceed the available assets of the estate.
For the moment, suffice it to say that once we determined that
this was a situation in which the tax claims did have that
quality, we had. a very practical and real concern that if
California were successful in its own courts, the judgment it
obtained might not be collectible.
QUESTION:

Is it a fact that the tax claims do exceed

the assets of the estate?

4
MR. FALK:

Yes.

We assert

that in our pleading,

and X think --QUESTION:
all?

But X mean has -that been established at

Is it tig reed to?
MR. FALK:

Brennan, by Texas.

X think, it is not agreed to, Mr. Justice
And I am prepared to discuss the reasons

why we think that it is demonstrably eo that they do.

Just as

an arithmetical matter, the tax rates total 101 percent on
all — the major portion of the estate.
QUESTION:

Do we know the sise of the estate?

Does

anyone know?
MR. FALK:

Well, the estate has filed a return, and

we have attached to our pleading an Appendix A, which sets forth,
calculations of the taxes under the various Federal and State
rates based on the return filed by the estate on

their own

agreed value.
The problem becomes exacerbated if the amount of the
estate is greater.

But even on those rates, there is a short­

fall of many millions of dollars.
QUESTION:

This is a Federal estate tax return that

has been filed?
MR. FALK:

A Federal ©state tax return.

And also

the California IT-22.

QUESTION:

Are the California assets — and you do

have real estate in the Los Angeles area, the estate does,

doesn’t it?
MR. FALK?

Mo, the estate does not, Mr. Justice -~

QUESTION;

3umma Corporation does.

MS-» FALK;

Summa doss, but unless it’s an alter ego,

we can't reach it.

k
QUEST>

Are those assets sufficient to pay the

California death taxes if it’s determined that Mr. Hughes v/as
not a California domiciliary?
MR. FALK?

Ho, because we can’t reach the assets

of Summa unies;? it is proven to be an alter ego of Mr. Hughes.
it

QUESTION;

That’s in litigation, is it not, in

MR. FALK%

I don’t believe it’s in litigation in

QUESTION:

Could it be?

MR. FALK;

1 don’t believe it could be in Delaware.

k. :

Delaware?

Delaware.

I suppose we could ~ we certainly could contend, and I think
would if compelled to, but it’s far from clear that such a
contention would be accepted.
QUESTION:

Has Texas intervened in the Delaware

MR. FALK:

Texas has been named as a party "'in the

litigation?

Delaware litigation and contends, and I must say I think
rightly, that it cannot be made a party there for reasons of
sovereign immunity, and I think for reasons of due process it

6
is not.

It has not voluntarily appeared, as I understand it.

They made a motion to quash find that motion is pending.
QUESTION;
MR. FALK;

California has made no appearance.
California has made no appearance and

intends to make no appearance!.
QUESTION;

Mr., Falk, don't you suppose there may be

some controversy over the value submitted in the Federal
estate tax return?
MR. FALK;

I fully expect that there will.

I

believe that all of the taxing authorities will contend that
the values are greater.
QUESTION;

For exfimpl®, Summa Corporation.

MR. FALK;

Summa Corporation being the main asset.

And there is an Internal Revenue Service investigation under
way and the States are doing likewise.
I think it5s quite unlikely that the values will be
lass.

The values that were reported, to put it mildly, were

conservative we think, and wo think the values will be
larger.

But it would taka a dramatic cut, which I think is

inconceivable -QUESTION;

I wonder on the issue before us how

that bears on whether or not we ought to accept original
jurisdiction.
MR. FALK;
possibility.

I think there was really no realistic

Texas doesn't contend that the values are less.

7
And there is really no realistic possibility that the values
would be such that lower rates of tax would apply.

So we are

in a situation in which I think it is safe to say that the
tax rates combine to 101 percent, and that problem is
exacerbated by a couple of factors that are mentioned in our
brief.

One, that soma of the items which are expenditures

by the estate, for example, litigation expenses, which are
awful her®, are not deductible under California law.

As a

result, although they are losing the money in the form of
these expenses, it doesn’t reduce their California taxes.

And

again it only exacerbates the shortfall.
The second problem is that Summa has encountered
really staggering losses in the years since Mr. Hughes died.
$29 million of operating loss in 1976, and I think the figure
was $169 million, if I recall correctly, reduction of net book
value in that same year.

197’’ isn't formalized.

We have been

advised informally that the figure will be somewhere in the
neighborhood of $15 million.

/
\

QUESTION:

Is there any controversy over whether

all of tli© assets of Mr. Hughes have bean marshaled?
MR. FALK;

X am not. aware of any.

I think they have

pretty much been identified and are subject of administrations
in several States»
QUESTION %

Mr. Falk, the amount of money, is that

book value or just actual money?

8
MRo FALK:

Well# the estate tax return was based

on an appraisal of the value, not on book value# and that will
be the basis

on which tax will be calculated. There is a pending

controversy as to whether that appraisal is an appropriate one.
QUESTION:

For purposes of our evaluating whether

this is or is not an appropriate case for original jurisdiction,
in your view would it make any difference whether the total
of all the taxes would consume 95 percent of the entire assets
or whether they would be 103 percent?
MR. FALK:

Mr. Chief Justice, in ray view it would not#

but 1 think under Texas v. Florida the 100 percent mark has
special significance.

I don't think I have to persuade you of

my alternative view# but I might in response to your question
suggest to you briefly what it is.

It starts with

Massachusetts v. Missouri# 300 U.S.# where the Court refused
to entertain a suit to prevent Missouri from imposing a tax
on a trust that had been established by a Massachusetts
domiciliary with a Missouri trustee# or trustees.

The Court

distinguished. Texas v« Florida in that ease # but on grounds
which to me suggest that, the 100 percent figure is not the
end of the case.

After noting that the trust assets of the

Missouri trust were sufficient to pay the taxes of both States#
the Court went on to say — 3 am going to quote from it — it
was shown that the tax claims of the two States are mutually
exclusive and that# to the contrary —■ again quoting — the

9
validity of each claim is wholly independent to that of the
other»

In other words, it wasn't a central issue of domicile
From this, we think that there is jurisdiction in

a suit between States in this area where two things are shown
First, that two or more States each seek to levy a tax on a
mutually exclusive ground, as there was in Taxas v. Flci.iln
and as there is here, domicile»

And, secondly, that the

claim of the defendant State in some concrete way, some real
way, injures the plaintiff State»
Mow, in Teras v. Florida that second element of
concrete injury was shown by the fact that the tax claim
exceeded 100 percent,

So you had a classic in the nature

interpleader situation„
Even if that were not here, we believe that our
pleadings show another kind of concrete injury that satisfies
’the standing in case or controvery 'requirement.

That is this

lie found ourselves with an inheritance tax claim which we
and the estate mutually desired to compromise and to thereby
avoid years of costly litigation.

The pendency of the Texas

claim was all that stcod in the way of California and the
os tat;® totally resolving the' inheritance tax matter.

It was

the pendency of that claim which prevented the estate from
'S

'

unconditionally agreeing to settle this case, and for very
understandable reasons?.

xf

they agreed to pay a large tax

to California and then were liable to Texas for a 1© percent

10

tax, the result would be devastating.

They ware unwilling, and

understandably so, to agree.
This is the problem with any situation of an inter­
pleader type where you can't get all of the parties into one
court.
QUESTIONs

But there really is never a basic for

No

'It' s not.

I don' t contend that it;s s

I say if you were forced to conclude that

didn’t exceed 100 percent, there would still be a

controversy between California and Texas, but not in the
classic interpleader mold, but simply because Texas is asserting
an inconsistent claim, inconsistent with California, that would
prevent California from resolving its major controversy with
the estate.
QUESTIONS

You say Texas is asserting an inconsistent

claim and then you say that

because of the assertion of that

claim, California .is unable to settle with the estate.

Those

are two s@par.ita assertions you make and both of them would
have to be upheld in order to support your alternative theory.
£

MR. FALKs

Factually upheld.

QUESTIONs

Well, survive the pleading stage.

MR. FALK?

Yes.

Now, I do want to stress that this

is not our primary submission.

It arises and is necessary only

if we are mistaken and the tax claims do not exceed 100 percent.

I am absolutely satisfied that they do., but in

MR. FALKs

I agree.

QUESTION s

Those two inconsistent determinations

create no Federal question of any kind.
MR. FALK:

I agree, they do not.

And that, of

course, is why Teacaa__y« Florida arises because there is no
solution to ‘die problem whore the taxes exceed 100 percent
save for an action in this Court.

Thera is no other way to

get a unitary adjudication.
QUESTION:

MR. FALK:

If that ware the law, Mr. Justice Stewart,

one aspect of Texas v. Florida would not ba present and that',
was emphasised in the Court's opinion that the law was the
same in all four States.
QUESTIONS

Why is that significant?

MR. FALK:

As I understand fch© interpleader conceptr

or in the nature of interpleader concept, it is that you have
inconsistent claims, and if the laws of the two States wer®
substantially different so that it would be possible under the
laws of both States for both States to be right, I am not sura
in my own mind if the Court would then appropriately exercise
jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

What law should the Court apply?

MR. FALK:

If it were to entertain jurisdiction, it

would have no basis for choosing between the two other than to
pick the law that made the most sense.
QUESTION:

We would be free to do that, would we?

MR, FALKs

I think you are as part of your original

jurisdiction.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Falk* following through on Justice

Stewart's question* it has always been assumed that inheritance
taxes follow domicile.

Do you think in our jurisprudence we

have gone beyond that point* or are about to and maybe
individual States can rest on something other than common law
notions of domicile?

I think there would be no due process

And I think there are

However* the laws of

Texas and California that have been invoked by our respective

MR. FALK ?

But maybe Mr. Justice Stone's emphasis

I am confidant that -- at

verdict that

Now,

w© are —
QUESTION:

That California asserts as a litigant.

MR. FALK:

I can't tell you what the

California

courts will do any more than Texas could in Texas v. Florida.

18
That litigation, of course, cams here before any litigation
had occurred in any State, and the Court rejected Justice
Frankfurter's suggestion that it was premature.
I had mentioned the first of the
considerations, and the second one has to do with Western Onion.
X think Western Onion is an important case, here.

In our view,

for reasons set forth in our papers in some detail, we think
Western Union took Texas v_ Florida one more step end made
exercise of this Courtps jurisdiction mandatory and not simply
optional in casas where — ani -they are rare ~ where two or
more States saek to tax the ©state beyond th© point of
confiscation.
I have road and reread Taxas’ reply on that point,
and X don't understand it.

They seem to contend that Western

Union is distinguishable because it involved a dispute over
property, the location of which was in question, whereas hare
and in Texas v, Florida the propery is located! within the
borders of Texas unless it has exclusive in ram jurisdiction
over it.

The property for the most part that is in this

estate consists of stock in a corporation which will foe taxed
in the place of domicile.

So Texas' position assumes the

answer to the question that has to foe litigated.

That really

is the same problem as there was in Western Union, and the
Court said in that case that Pennsylvania lacked jurisdiction
as a matter of Federal constitutional law, lacked jurisdiction

19
to proceed because it could not assure Western Union that it
would not be liable inconsistently to the eschete demands of
other States»
I think one passage in the Court9s opinion on that
point is quite significant»

Tha Court said, “The situation

here — in Western Union — is in all material respects like
that which caused us to take jurisdiction in Texas v. Florida» ”
So as we read Western Union aid as we read it today, that
decision obliged us, and indeed obliged Tessas,to come to this
Court rather than to proceed in our own State courts, once it
bacam© clear that tax clams ware being asserted in excess of
the amount of the Estate»
Finally, another factor that 1 want to mention just
briefly that brought u:,i here and I think is important for this
Court's exercise of jurisdiction was our own sense of fairness.
To have proceeded independently to litigate the tax claim
I

in our own courts, as Texas sought to do, even if we could do
so, Western Union, notwithstanding, simply did not comport with
our notion of a fair and appropriate process»

Xfc seemed to us

that it would b© incredibly inefficient to generate multiplicitous litigation which would only degenerate into what really
would be a three-ring circus without a ringmaster.

There

would be litigation in California, Testas, Nevada, Delaware,
all proceeding without any —
QUESTION?

ite. Falk, you are familiar with Georg®

MR. FALK:

fjr. Justice Rehnquist, 1 don't pretend

were here and acted/ of course, in the interest of the taxpayers
of California.

But ife does seem to us that it is appropriate

for governmental officials, taxing officials, to fe© concerned
with the fairness of their conduct.

After all, we are

accountable to that set of standards as well.

And it seemed

to us that all the decisions that ar© relevant to this Court
and all the literature in the last four years, since Texas v..
Florida condemned a process by which an estate can be wiped
oat by inconsistent domicile litigation in several States.
That strikes me as unfair.

I think it ought to strike the

I think it would strike the public as unfair.

Aid we chose not to do it for all of the reasons that I have
suggested, and I don’t mean to be sanctimonious about it.
X think it was an appropriate factor for us —
QUESTION:

Are you going to address the argument

of Texas that th© impact of the agreement you mad© and the
:S ”

estate made —
■f-

MR. FALK:

Yes, I am.

Th© position of Texas, as X

understand it, is that our agreement demonstrates in some
fashion that we are hare assuming on behalf of private
citizens and not on behalf of a Stats.

And that makes relevant,

the small number of cases, Hew Hampshire v, Louisiana,

21
Oklahoma ex rel. Johns ok

. Cock.,, which disentitled a State

to do so really on the ground of the 11th Amendment and it8 s a
limitation on the Court's jurisdiction,,

That position of

Tessas is both factually and legally unsound»

There are two

cases on that point that. I want to call to the Court's
attention.

One is cited in our reply brief. South Dakota v,

North Carolina , where the Court distinguished those earlier
cases in a situation in which a small number of bonds of a
3tat© had been

assigned to South Dakota and they had been

assigned unconditionally.

The motive of the donor was

perfectly apparent from writings that are cited in the Court’s
opinion.

He made that' donation for reasons of his own.

Court said the motive of the donor is irrelevant.

The

South Dakota

is suing for interests, however small# of its own and'the
•f/

.

;A

action can be maintained.
Another case not cited in our brief# but X do want
to call to the Court's attention is North Dakota v. Minnesota
in 263 UoS» at 365# and then in another opinion at 584»
"TKer© a suit was brought by one State complaining of flooding
caused by the acts of a neighboring State.

The loss caused

by the flooding did millions of dollars of damages to private
"lands in -fell® plaintiff State aad something like $5 #000 in
damages to the State's own bridges and highways, as I recall.
The Court allowed the action even though the interest of the
State was rather small, and even though it noted in the second

22
of the two opinions that the landowners of the plaintiff State who
were then affected by the flooding, and I quote, "raised a
fund to conduct the litigation."

So I think it's apparent in

I-

that case the State was induced to act by the private citizens
who stood to benefit.
Thus, as I read the casas, a State may sue in this
Court notwithstanding that private citisens are benefited, and

even though private citizens induced the lawsuit.
Now, having said all that, 1 want to say that's not
what happened.

The record before this Court, and X

to an affidavit that I had

for preliminary injunction, shows that the decision to file
the suit was made several weeks before we had any conversation
whatever with the estate on the subject of settlement.

Bo I understand this, Mr» Attorney

General, is this an argument that in fact California is fronting
for the heirs?
MR. HILL:

No question about it.

QUESTION:

Is that what it is?

MR. HILL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought this agreement guarantees

California the sura of i>2 million, doesn't it?
MR. HILL:

Two percent even if Texas wins.

QUESTION:

Was it 2 percent?

MR. HILL:

We are not afraid to litigate the matter

QUESTION:

Your argument is we

before you.
ought not to take

this case in original jurisdiction because, if California is
merely fronting for the heirs, that creates a kind of 1.1th

that Mr. Falk referred to.

in short, the rule must be, we believe, that if a
State comes here under Article III, Section 2, it must com©
clearly and unequivocally and under its own statute or xaw
on which its claim is based and unfettered by an agreement to
qome here for benefits to be bestowed regardless of the merits
of the underlying claim.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, if the agreement

had not been made, do you think the State of Nevada wou.-~«J. be
in here?
MR. HILL:

They are not a taxing State,

28

QUESTION:

I know, but would they be in here?

MR. HILL:

Well, I don’t think so,

I have no reason

to believe that the Attorney General of Nevada would have
entered into this agreement.
QUESTION;

No interest.

MR. HILL:

He would have no interest at all, had

shown no interest any more than California did until the eve
of our trial.

That’s when they got this agreement and started

showing an interest.

If they were really interested, xdiy

didn’t they come here, why did they permit us to spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars, put in thousands of man-hours out in the
wide open, most of it in lettsrs sent out in California with
California counsel assisting us, travel all over the world and
take 50-odd depositions, and discover hundreds of thousands
of documents out of three or four million documents that xve

I
ware actually both sides working with pretrial,

preset the

trial, January 1977 to sat the trial in September of 1977,
all of which they knew about, and let us go ahead and proceed
and go to all that trouble and work in our own court and have
a fair and square trial with overwhelming evidence •—I can' t
obviously retry it here, but it’s a case that will be won
wherever it is heard — and then come here and ask on behalf of
the estate really, "You relitigate the Tessas domicile issue.
£nd that is all we want to tender to you, that very limited
issue.

29

QUESTION;

Is that, as you see it, what the issue

would be if this complaint is filed, whether or not the
decedent lived in Texas?

Is that going to be the question,

or is the question going to be where did he live at the time
of his death?
MB. HILL:

They won't tender anything else.

Their

motion tenders only to this Court the (question of Texas
domicile.

You see, they simply want this Court to take it, give it

to a master and hope they can gang up on us and get the
master to find
QUESTIONs

What will the issue be before the master?

MR. HILL:

Whether Texas was not the domicile.

Whether or not Texas was the domicile

of the decedent at the time of his death.

If not, where was

the domicile of the decedent at the time of his death.
MR. HILL;

In fact, they win when you cut us out.

QUESTION:

Quite different, therefore, from Texas v.

MR. HILL:

Oh, you can’t traak it with radar.

Florida.»

Using this Court, or undertaking to, for an
inequitable and unjust, purpose clearly violates the provisions
of the 11th Amendment as e. suit which in reality is for the
benefit of private litigants, it would also bring this Court's
equitable jurisdiction .Into play without due regard to, first,
the necessity of the Court's participation.

It would invoke

it without due concern for the possible abuse of the Court's
jurisdiction in other cases without first requiring California
to utilise its own courts to determine the underlying merits of
its claim, without due regard to the fact that Texas had
already obtained a domicile verdict in its own courts -~
QUESTION: That’s a point, Mr. Hill, if a master
were appointed, he couldn’t ignore that Texas proceeding, could
he?

He would have to go into it, wouldn’t he?
MR. HILL:

We would certainly claim that he couldn’t.

But I tell you the jurisdiction once taken here, and a master
is appointed, so often I find that in some cases it just seems
to wipe out a lot of things that, have happened before.

QUESTION:

And that’s a matter of fact, perhaps, or

MR, HILL:

Clearly.

They are asking you to come in

hers without regard to requiring California to com® and present

31
a, hard and concrete case.
QUESTION:

General Hill,, there is a Federal statute

on the books apropos of my Brother Marshall's question

that

says Federal courts must give full faith and credit to the
decrees of State courts.

Bo you think that binds this Court

as a Federal court in a case under its original jurisdiction?
MR. HILL:

Me will certainly take that position.

QUESTION:

Do you have any reason to take it other

than you think it helps your case?
MR. HILL:

Obviously for that reason, until another —

QUESTION:

You don’t need to take that position idle

way. the case is lined up here, do you?
MR. HILL:

Really not.

Really not because we just

have considerations here that haven't been brought out.
This Court — and I know I need not cite your own
opinions, but this is so relevant to what I am trying to
convey from the Texas standpoint, is your statement recently
{made in Arizona v» New Mexico — and may I please quote it:
"Via recently reaffirmed that cur original jurisdiction should
be invoked sparingly in Illinois v. City of Milwaukee where
we additionally stated we construed SB U.S..C. section 125.1(a) (1)
as v?9 do Article III, Section 2, to honor oar original jurisdic­
tion, but to make it obligatory only in appropriate case „ av)<j
the question of what is appropriate concerns the Court; the
seriousness and dignity of the claim. ' Yet beyond that it

32
necessarily involves the availability of another forum where
there is jurisdiction over the main parties where the issues
tendered may be litigated and where appropriate relief may be
had»

we employ sparing use of our original jurisdiction so

that our increasing duties with the appellate docket will not
suffer.”
Nearly 40 years ago in Massachusetts v, Missouri,
to which Counsel Falk alluded, this Court said!

"In the

exercise of our original jurisdiction so a? to truly fulfill
the constitutional purpose, we not only must look to the nature
of the interest of the complaining State, the essential
quality of the right assorted, but we must also inquire whether
recourse to that jurisdiction is necessary for the State"a
protection.”
Now, than, with that in mind, the narrowness of the
issue tendered by California, that is, \a negative finding
against Texas, is proof enough that the quality of the
interest attempted to be provided to California, that is, an
18 percent interest by itself which it may not be entitled to
hinder any merit, is not of a kind to be entertained her© by
\

this Court in invoking that solemn jurisdiction.

If California

really wants to litigate its entitlement, that issue of
domicile can and should be under the circumstances here
presented- litigated- in California.

If California is successful

there on that issue, it can repetition here if in fact facts

and information show that there is more taxes that they can't
get there, their taxation, and then yon decade whether to take
the case or let it be heard in a Delaware forum where the
question of Summa Corporation exists and where any problems
that do in fact ever occur, not pursuant to soma settlement
agreement but pursuant to honest claims being —
QUESTION:

Mr» Attorney General, are you willing

to litigata in Delaware?
MR. HILL: When we get to the position —
QUESTIONS

Well, the answer is no right now»

MR. HILL:

Ho, not now, we clearly are not and we

do not anticipate it.
QUESTIONs

If California does try
Of course, it might he a forum, if both

of you agreed, that could solve the entire matter.
MR. HILLS

That's true.

QUESTIONS

Would the Delaware forum, as you call it,

have jurisdiction over a lawsuit between the State of Texas
and the State of California?
MR. HILL:

it could.only come up, and I don't want

to be bound by this, I don't think it is necessary to gat into
it in this proceeding, but as I see it, the only way-it could
possibly — I underscore possibly — come up would be if
California in fact secures a favorable finding in this Court
on the merits and. then the proof shows that it was impossible
for us to gat this matter disposed of or that ham of 120

States filing competing claims to the same property.
MR. HILL2

Right.

And than let me just close by —
QUESTION;

To a Delaware asset that is clearly

within the jurisdiction of the Delaware court.
MR. HILL;

I think all these questions about Delaware,

if I might say—t don’t go further

here than is obviously

necessary to decide what we are here about — is simply to say
that that question can bo addressed if it ever becomes proper
to be addressed, and this Court will have an opportunity to
look at that if that ever becomes germane.
QUESTIONS

General Hill, a little while ago you said

that California should go about its business and proceed in its
own courts and so forth, and then come here when certain things
ware established.

Would you be opposing original jurisdiction

at that time also?
MR. HILL;

I don’t know.

It would just depend on

if they had a case at that tine stated without reference to
agreements under Tessas v11:.nois and I thought Texas v.
Illinois applied, I would than have to make a determination as
to whether

QUESTION:

At least the agreement —

MR. BILL:

You don’t have to deal vath it hare,,

I might want to ask you to deal with it.
QUESTION:

At least the agreement —

MR. HILL:

And this Court might want to reconsider it«

QUESTION:

General Hill, at least the agreement' -

accomplished the elimination of Nevada as a possible party.
This is one thing it accomplished.

After all, you are in a

position here representing a State which itself brought the
Texas v. Florida litigation.

Now you are representing a

State which denies the original jurisdiction of this Court.
You are hung with it, but there it is.
MR. HILL:

No, I am not.

General McGraw 45 years

ago came into this Court with a lot of other attorney generals
pretty much by agreement,

The Court wouldn't let them in

until they could go out and resolve the fact of what thz tauc: :•
Were going to be so that the master wouldn't have all that
foolish work to do, and then when they came back in practically
in an agreed situation, the Court took it,

Justice Frankfurter

didn't think much of it, but that's neither hero nor there.
They did take it.

And they heard it.

And Texas who brought it lost.

And they resolved it.

And I think General McGraw

were ha hero today would be applauding what I'm doing mid
believe that it's totally consistent with what I should be doing

and it's an entirely different situation.

This is not in any

37

sense a Texas ?, F3,orlda case.
QUESTION:

I taka it at a later time your first

question would b€i that the matter of domicile would, not be
open for any kind of reconsideration, because it has been
determined in the Texas court.
MR. KILL:

Yes.

Clearly.

I would certainly b®

derelict in
QUESTIONS

And that would be true later if you all

thought you should go to Delaware and try to —
MR. HILL:

Exactly.

QUESTION s

You would say that everything might be

open but not domicils.
MR. HILL:

Those fir© exactly the attitude —

QUESTION:

Would it be reviewable by this Court

or any other Federal court?

It’s not a question of Federal

.'Law* is it?
MR. HILL:

No, not at all.

So I conclude by reminding that if there is the
slightest doubt about why we are here and that I say we are
hare out of the estate's worry over the Texas domicile finding
not only for estate tax purposes but for other purposes, that
it ought to be perfectly clear when you look at this agreement ^
that's why we ar© here because in addition to giving them the
2 percent guarantee, they com© back and say, "We will give
you all of tii© lawyers you need."

Some of them are here today

38
in court»

"We will work with you hand in glove and we will

give you all of our depositions.

We will give you all of our

work product and maybe together we can do Texas in."
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, a while ago you

said that the figure of 120 percent,, that is, referring to the
aggregata amount of taxes, in absurd, ridiculous, something
like that, and that in any event it wasn't more than 101 percent.
Now, for tha purposes of this case what is the
difference whether the taxes are 101 percent of all the assets
or 190 parcant of all the assets?
MR. HILL:

I think for today at least for the purpose

of this hearing, the answer would be that if it’s 101 — we
don’t know, but let's just assume for the purpose of your
question it is —- than California is petitioning here to got
you to vitalise an agreement which would harm them 68 percent
of what they say they are entitled to under their figure, and
yet they want you to do it under tha authority of the case
that would say we are going to protect yon from 1 percent ham.
Under this agreement it just simply is immaterial inquiry now
as to whether it is 101 percent, ends up being 98 percent.
It's not the basic inquiry before this Court because tha
fundamental bias in their case is this agreement.
get away froir it.

You can’t

Will Lunaais — and it's in our brief *■*-

used the words — I have them written down somewhere **“ where
-he said in effect that we are here pursuant to this «gzoirarat.

39
That's his sworn testimony given in December.
Now, there cannot be any doubt about that.

We are

here pursuant tc that agreement/ and that .is the full answer/
a complete answer, a total answer to the denial of this motion
for leave to file and invoke this Court's original jurisdiction,
Never should this Court tolerate that kind of a situation.
And you would rue the day if you did and open the gates for
this kind of trading around between high e-state tax States
which we claim to try to get negative findings against 16
parcent States with good claims.

MR. FALK:

Than we would have had a settlement.

QUESTIONS

That’s right,

QUESTION?

If the theory, Mr, Falk, is that a

neutral forum is the only place for a controversy of this
kind to be settled, why should not your prayer have been to
determine what you say now is the da facto issue where mm
the domicile of Mr. Hughes at the time of his death instead of
just attacking it on terms of Texas?
MR. FMiKj

Mr. Chief Justice, if jurisdiction turns

on that question, w® are quite prepared to amend our pleading
to ask the Court to do just that.
planning on doing just that.
the Court to do that.

And we were originally

Papers were drafted that asked

Papers had even been sent, to the printer

asking the Court to do that, without discussion of a settlement
because none had been discussed.

And we then entered into

negotiation with the estate and narrowed the issue.

That’s what

happened»
I fail to sc;© how -shat can alter the need to have a.
unitary adjudication.

So this is the only place to go for that

adjudication.
QUESTION:

Mr. Falk, if a master were appointed to

determine this and he were to determine that domicil® was
Nevada at the time of Mr. Hughes9 death, do I understand there

46
is no inheritance tax in Nevada?
MR. FALK:

That's correct„ Mr. Justice.

QUESTION2

What, then, would ba the effect of that

determination, that he was domiciled in Nevada, upon the
State5s claims to inheritance taxes?
MR. FALK:

But for the settlement, ws 'would be

entitled feo collect no domicile-based tax.
QUESTION:

But undnr the agreement California would

still have at least $2 million, is it?
MR. FALK:

No, under the agreement, if Nevada ware

found to be the domicile, ‘the astate has in effect settled
that controversy with us and has agreed to pay us an 18 percent
tax notwithstanding that.

For example, if you settle a lawsuit with

several parties involved and some settle out, that settlement

QUESTION^

Wouldn't the ©state, Mr. Falk, be in the

same position as the executors in the Dorrance ©state where
they volunteered payment to Pennsylvania and then New Jersey
interposed a claim and established domicile and collected
$18 million against Pennsylvania's $16 million and then when
the executors triad to get back the $16 million from Pennsylvania
they were toll no, that: was a voluntary payment.
MR. FALK:

They would have no remedy.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that be the same?

MR. FALK:

I think that's correct.

I think they

’would have no remedy and they would be in that position because
they made a decision to ask for a lower tax. rate and to abandon
defensesthat were otherwise available to them.
was a choice that they

I think that

knowingly »n.d they r"',l havo to

pay the consequences if that .is what it turns out.
QUESTION*

Of course, you recall the Dorrance

executors wera surcharged for that.
MR. FALK:

1 didn't know that, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

X just wonder here, if it were determined

49
that Nevada after all# where there is no inheritance tax# was
the domicil©# what about the ©state paying California, a
State with inheritance taxes»
QUESTIONS

Of course# it wouldn't be entirely base­

less,, assuming that you can pierce ‘the Summa Coproration vail#
because you have som© substantial tasses due to California
because of your real estate»
MR» FALK;

Some,

It's not 'the bulk of the estate#

but ther® are substantial assets in California.
QUESTION?

Mr. Falk# are you a full-time attorney

• 'general for the State of California?
MR. FALK:

No# Mr. Justice# X am in privat® practice.

■ I am special counsel for the State of California.
QUESTION s
.!

Did you ever represent any other party

•

' to tills case# other than the State of California?
MR,. FALK:

Absolutely not.

And X have filed a

sworn affidavit with this Court# which was presented to Mr.
• Justice Powell# and I think referred to the entire Court, in
which I said under penalty of perjury that this decision was
mad©, and X will g© farther and say the papers were prepared
"and ready to b© filed, or almost ready to be filed, they wore
at the printer, before wa got into any discussion whatever with
the estate on tha subject of settlement.
So the charge is just false.
QUESTION:

Except this coraplairt. doesn’t ask the

30

Court to determine where the decedent was domiciled, whether
Nevada or the Bahamas or Mexico or where, simply that ha was,
on the date of his death, not a domiciliary of Tessas, period.
MR . FALK*

That’s correct.

As I say, if we thought

it ware necessary, if the Court finds it necessary, we are
prepared to amend it and to take our chances with the broader
question.
1 see no purpose to be served by that.

The astate

has made its decision, and we have agreed to accept the lower
rats of tax in settlament of that aspect of the case, and it
seams to us that it serves the benefit of everyone to narrow
the isous.

We have really only one problem left.

I thought

that was a constructive -thing to do.
QUESTIONS

It may .veil be.

MR. FALKs

your statement is absolutely correct,

Mr. Justiceo
QUESTION s

We have to reach our decision on the

basis of the pleadings as they are now- before us.
MR. FALKs

yes, I think that is true.

QUESTION»

Not on the basis of some possible

amendment that you may have in mind.
MR. FALK;

I think

Chief Justice.
QUESTION*

Thank you gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was concluded.)
