MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 76--6997, Sandra Lockett against Ohio.
Mr. Amsterdam, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
The case of Sandra Lockett versus Ohio
of the same issues relating to the constitutionality of the
Ohio death penalty statutes that were involved in the Bell
case just argued.
However, in the Lockett case there are some serious
federal constitutional questions in regard to the procedures
through which Miss Lockett's conviction of the crime of
aggravated murder was obtained and because the Court will not
and need not reach the question of penalty unless it affirms
her conviction on the merits, I would like to devote soma por­
tion of my argument time to the issue of whether or not the
Federal Constitution was violated in Miss Lockett’s conviction
by improper prosecutorial, comment on her failure to take the
witness stand in her defense.
In addressing this issue, let rae if I may just
describe very briefly the background of this trial and the

respective theories of the parties at the trial»
Miss Lockett stands convicted and condemned of the
crime of aggravated murder for a killing of Sydney Cohen, a
pawn shop proprietor in the course of a pawn shop robbery.
At the time that Mr. Cohen was killed,, the gun was
in the hands of A1 Parker , the chief state prosecution witness
in this case.
The prosecution’s theory is that Parker, Petitioner'
brother, Jamas Lockett, one Nathan Dew and the Petitioner had
conspired and planned together to rob Syd!s Market Loan Com­
pany, that they had all gone there for that*purpose, that the
Petitioner had remained outside in the car and that the three
men had gone

in, committed the robbery in the courseof which,

according to

his own testimony Mr. Cohen snatched atthe gun

and it went off accidentally and although the killing was
totally

outside the plan of the robbery, he was killed.
Nov/, the important thing to recognize —

"It hadn't been discussed, the killing?"

"Okay.

"No, sir."
That is what I mean, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Well, of course I suppose, on that

theory, the perpetrators would not need any bullets in the
gun if they had no intention whatever of making use of them,
would they?
Would not an empty pistol have done just as well?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, the ~™

They loaded it there, I recall now.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

There was a plan to —- they did not

go into the pawn shop with a gun.

They went in with bullets

and they certainly did arm a gun which was in there.

There

is no doubt that the planning included using a weapon, a loaded
weapon but the plan did not include killing.

It is not one of

these execution-style, kill the witness type of things,
according to the prosecutor's own testimony.
For purposes of the self“incrimination issue, how­
ever, v/hat is important is this, that the prosecution theory
as against petition is entirely that she was a party to this
conspiracy to go in and rob.
TllQ defense theory was not that the Petitioner did

6
not know her brother and Dew and Parker or that she was some­
where

else.

The Defense admitted that she went with them to

the pawn shop and sat outside but the Defense contention was
that there was no plan to rob at all and that she thought that
they were going in to pawn a ring.
Now, all of the evidence which connects the Peti­
tioner with a specific plan to rob the pawnshop is Parker's
testimony.

If this Court will, examine the opinion of the Ohio

Supreme Court, it will find that its whole recitation

of the

V

facts of the case consist of a recitation of Parker’s testimony

i

with a statement that it was corroborated by the testimony of

11'V

several other rainor witnesses.
What is significant, however, is that the testimony

; r

of those witnesses, while corroborating parts of Parker's and
while consistent with a theory of Petitioner’s guilt, was also

•

-i'

perfectly consistent with a theory of Petitioner’s innocence,
including the very theory of Petitioner's innocence espoused
I;

f, i

by the Petitioner herself, namely, that she was just along for

fit

1

the ride.
Now, against this background, the following things

•;

happened in trial.

Petitioner did not testify.

There was an

k

unhappy incident in which her lawyer indicated she would, take
the stand but she declined and did not.

She called the only

two members of the conspiracy, Dew and her brother, whom the
prosecution did not present — because Parker was the chief

prosecution witness and they both took the Fifth in front of
the jury, moving all of the conspirators out of account as
possible witnesses and then# in the course of closing arguments in the case# the prosecutor made the argument of which
we complain.
In a theme that recurs constantly throughout the
argument and staccato repetition underlining for emphasis the
theme, the prosecutor repeated again

and again

seven times

in all— that the prosecution's evidence was uncontradicted
and unrefuted and the prosecutor closed

ur. contradicted and

unrefuted evidence, nothing from the defense, no evidence from
the defense.
How# our submission is simply that in the

context

of this case that is a *—■* would be taken by the jury to direct
their attention to the
in her own behalf.

Defendant's failure to take the stand

It is: therefore a forbidden comment on her

privilege against self-incrimination and vitiates her convic­
tion under griffin

verst:.s California.

To argue this point, I think I need only make a
factual analysis, if I may, of Parker's testimony because I
think that if one understands what Parker's testimony is about
and how this case appeared to the jury, the Fifth Amendment
issue can only result one: way.
If you look at. Parker's testimony you will
hnat there are a total of .15

.find

episodes which in any way could

8

conceivably connect Petitioner to the plot to rob the store.
Now, by 15 episodes, 1 do not want to give the
impression that there is a lot of evidence.

First of all, all

this is Parker8s testimony.
Secondly, many of these episodes are very minor
details, quite consistent with innocence — as consistent with
innocence as with guilt.

They are just probably historic.

But when I sa^ episodes, I mean scenes.

If you

conceive of it as though we were projecting a movie or making
a movie of these events, there would be 16 scenes and that is
important because the question is, who is available to testify
to each of these scenes?
Our submission is that the only relevant scenes,
the only witnesses are Parker, the Defendant, the other co­
defendants and therefore when the prosecutor says "Our evi­
dence is unconfcradicted,' the

jury says, "Who could contra­

dict it?"
Answer, "Only the Defendant."
QUESTION:

Well, what do you do as counsel when you

have only imconfcradicted evidence?

Do you mean you cannot tell

the jury it is unconfcradicted?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

If You say on one
occasion that the

evidence is uncontradicted, that would be a very different
t hing than if you say it seven times uncontradicted and unre­
futed.

It also makes a difference whether Petitioner is the

only person who can contradict or refute evidence.

We are not

arguing that the Prosecutor can never say evidence is uncon­
tradicted.

What we are arguing is that if the Prosecutor’s

MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —-

I do not see how you can muzzle the Pro­

secutor by your trial tactics.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Mr. Justice Marshall, it is one

thing to affirmatively argue the credibility of a prosecution
witness.

It is another -- I know of some cases I have argued

if you would not let me say uncontradicted, I would' not know

11
how to argue because I was so happy to have it uncontradicted.
You cannot say, muzzle the Prosecutor that way.

And as

Defense Counsel, I am for muzzling him, but you know —
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Well, if the Prosecutor makes an

argument which invites the jury to say to itself, "Gee, the
Defendant did not take the stand.

If she had taken the stand,

then if she had been innocent, she would have taken the stand.
But she did not take the stand so she must be guilty."
That, it seams to me, is what the privilege is
all about.

Now, the Prosecutor is arguing -—
QUESTION:

Do you tliink a jury — jurors, intelli­

gent jurors do not ask that question of themselves, even if
the prosecutor has never mentioned a word about it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

That is certainly a risk which is

involved in the system but it is the square holding in Griffin
versus California that that risk cannot be increased in any
way by comment on the part of any of the parties to the pro­
ceeding.

A prosecutor cannot invite the jury to draw that

conclusion, even though the jury might do it itself, nor can
the Court and a prosecutor's argument which hammers home to the
jury again and again, so that the jury must necessarily be
thinking to itself, what we are being asked to convict on is
the fact that the Defendant did not take the stand and answer
the evidence of the prosecution.

can direct the -jury's

attention to the fact that there are other available wicnesaes
whom the Defendant did not call but the very purpose of my
analysis of Parker's testimony was to show that, in fact, there
were no other witnesses in this case.
QUESTION:

I trust, Mr. Amsterdam, yoii are not

going to consume all of your time on this question.

There are

other questions in this case and I think you may fairly asurae
that some of those who voted to grant certiorari in this case
were interested in those other questions.
MR AMSTERDAM:

All right, I think that it may make

sense for me to pass to the death penalty

questions at this

point.
QUESTION:

You can answer this one yes or no, though.

Was there an instruction in this case, any instruction from the
Court as to the significance of the Defendant's not testi­
fying?

13

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Yes, there was.

There was one

paragraph -—
QUESTION:

This has no significance attached to it?

MR. AMSTERDAM;
QUESTION:

Your second point?

That says no significance should be

attached to if?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Yes, thank you.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

That is correct.

All right, then, if I may move to the death penalty
issues in this case.
QUESTION:

This first question is covered in your

brief.
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

It is covered in your brief, is it not?

MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

Yes.

The first question, yes.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

The only thing I had wanted to

point out, Justice Stewart, because it was not dealt with in
our brief — since it was raised

only in Respondent's brief

was the notion that there were other witnesses who could have
testified.
Going to Justice Marshall's question, the answer
is on the facts of this case there are no other witnesses who
could testify to any relevant events that split the difference

14
between the prosecution and defense theory.
If I may move into the dealth penalty question, I
simply want to speak to two of the several constitutional
attacks on Ohio’s death penalty because I think it is impor­
tant to point out their relationship.
One is the one of which the Court heard arguments
this morning, that the Ohio death penalty statute is too narrow,
too much circumscribes consideration of mitigating circumstan­
ces to meet the command of the Woodson and Roberts cases that
individualized consideration be given to circumstances of
offense and offender»
The second argument, which is raised in both Bell
and walfcon,

the argument that the application of the death

penalty to a person who was neither a participant in the
killing nor an intentional perpetrator of any act that was
directed toward killing affronts the proportionality principle

of Coker and earlier cases because just as much as

Ehrlich

Coker, Sandra Lockett may bs a felon, but not a murderer, not
a deliberate taker of human life.
Mow, I want to point out, though, that there is a
relationship between those two arguments because in combination
they produce still a third constitutional contention which is
the narrowest conceivable ground on which these cases could be
decided.
Inasmuch as the vary circumstance which we contend

15
preeludas the death penalty totally, that, is the fact that
Sandra Lockett has been condemned for a crime which she did not
do, did not attempt, did not intend -- that is, a killing.
Inasmuch as that factor of the case is one of the
very factors whose consideration the Ohio statute precludes,
this Court could decide these cases Simply on the ground that
whether or not it would be constitutional for a state to im­
pose the death penalty ir. a ease like this, it is unconstitu­
tional for the state to do so while forbidding the.sentencer
even to consider the mitigating circumstance that the Defen­
dant was. not the perpetrator of the crime and neither intended
nor did anything in furtherance-- - f the killing itself as dis ­
tinguished from the underlying robbery.
Now, that argument and the arguments about the
narrowness of the Ohio statute in preclusion of consideration
of mitigating circumstances is what -QUESTIONi

concept.

.

Oh, Lord, no, Mr. Chief Justice

There is no attack here at all on the felony murder
As fax- as conviction goes, that is perfectly appro­
But if Coker has any meaning, one of its meanings
.

-

must be that if the Defendant’s conviction rests only on the
felony that the death sentence which is being imposed, not for
rrva murder but only for the felony,, is disproportionate.

16
Our argument goes only to the death penalty.

It

has nothing to do with the constitutionality of felony murder
as a basis for conviction.

That is perfectly accepted.

What I think it is important to recognize on the
facts of this case * however, is the fact that that is exactly
what Petitioner is.

She is, at most, an armed robber.

She has the mental state, the culpability of any
participant in any

robbery aad no most© them that;..

Tins prosecution in its brief suggests that the jury
must have found that the Defendant intended to kill Sydney
Cohen because part of the element of aggravated murder is
purposely killing.
I want to dispel that, theory right now.

It is ti

that the Court charged the jury that but it also charged the
jury —- and this is the key to this whole case —• at pages
.16 and 119 '.of - the - Appendix:

"A person engaged in' s common

I..-:sign with others to rob by force and violence an individual
or '-individuals of their property is presumed to acquiesce in
whatever may reasonably be necessary to accomplish the object.
And if under the circumstances it may reasonably be expected
that the victim's life would be in danger by the .manner and
means of performing the criminal act, each one engaged i.n tha
common design is bound by the consequences naturally or pro­
bably arising,

in its furtherance.

"if the conspired robbery -and the manner of its

accomplishment would

b

each plotter is equally

reasonably likely to produce death,
guilty with the principal offender as

an aider and abettor in the homicide...... An intent to kill
by an aider and abettor may he found to exist beyond a reason­
able doubt under such circumstances.”
Nov, later on that same page the Court defines in­
tent as the same thing as purpose and elsewhere in this charge
it talks about inferences as a very different thing from
presumptions.

So what the jury was charged in this case was

that it should find the Defendant guilty of purposely killing
Sydney Cohen if she participated in an armed robbery attempt.
The Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court affirmed
her convictions on exactly that theory.

Indeed, the very

issue which divided the Ohio Supreme Court here four to three
would never have arisen on this.
So what wa are: dealing with is, we are? dealing with
& case in which the Defendant has been sentenced to die for
nothing more than participation in an armed robbery which, at
someone else’s hands resulted in death.
QUESTION:

Now, --

Would the same thing go for James Lockett

and Dev;?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Their involvement could, on a fac-

fcuai. record different than this one have been shown to be
more substantial.
QUESTION:

No, but how about on this reco.ru?

How

18

about on this record?

How about James Lockett.? for example?

MR» AMSTERDAM;

Mr. Justice? you see first of all?

the problem with analysis like that is? we are talking about
a record in which no lawyer was addressing the problem of
Lockett's culpability and so I really do

not — I just do

not know the answer.
QUESTION:

So you do not say that only the trigger

man may be punished? then?
MR. AMSTERDAM;
QUESTION:

Oh? no.

No? no? no? no.

Who else may be?

Anybody

who had the

intent that there be a death?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

1 think that this Court has to look

very carefully at what was involved in Coker and what is the
rationale from which the Court has sustained capital punish­
ment at all.

The question of whose finger was on the trigger

is not important but the question whether or not the Defendant
was a participant in a scheme aimed directly and deliberately
at human life is very important and this Defendant:was not a
planner or a plotter in a scheme to kill.
®*©w, whether James Lockett was or not? Your Honor?
I do not know.

And the other is whether Ohio

forbid consideration even of these elements.
Now, I will go this far with no hesitation, that

it is impermissible constitutionally for Ohio to forbid consi­
deration of the fact that Parker’s shooting was accidental.
That I would say categorically.

That is to say,

even if the death penalty can be imposed on Parker, for Ohio
to say, as it has, that whether he shot anci deliberately and
intentionally killed Sidney Cohen and whether the gun want off

that poses a difficult

question this case does impose because that is not Sandra
Lockett.
That might be James Lockett.

It might b@ Dew.

It

20

probably is Parker on this record but it certainly is not
Sandra Lockett because Sandra Lockett, at most, was aware of
the fact that people ware going into

a

store with a loaded

gun — no indication of any plan as to how it would be used,
in answer to the Chief Justice's question ■— simply that bul­
lets would be put in a gun.
I take it that the idea of putting bullets in the
gun does not necessarily mean to fire because since the gun
was being taken from the pawn shop proprietor and since he
would know that, empty, it would pose no threat, one would
have to load it in order to pose a

credible threat for a

robbery so there is no supposition whatever that anybody
intended to shoot, that gun.
And, Mr. Justice White, our submission does not turn,
at all on whose finger is on the trigger.

It is whether to

use the language of the Gregg case itself, the Defendant has
been sentenced to death for a deliberate killing which this
Defendant has not [done.]
If a defendant is part of a scheme in which some­
body else shoots, that is just a© deliberate as if[the

defen­

dant shoots himself or herself.
I would like to leave soma time for rebuttal and
although there are otfaor aspects of the case, I think that
this has sufficiently presented the inner relationship of the
issues and particularly the narrowest ground of decision so

that, it provides a good stopping place unless the Court has

So it is in her mind, it is in the conspirators’
mind force will be used.

Now, they did not sit down and plan,

idea of aiding and abetting, the idea of felony murder is
established in. Ohio.
QUESTION:
Mr. Layman.

Well, let me ask you a question, if I may,

I understood you to say in response to Justice

Stewart’s question, I believe it was, a moment ago, that Ohio
does not follow the ordinary concept of felony murder, at least
what I consider to be the ordinary concept of felony murder
and that is, if one goes into the convenience store with a gun
intending to rob the proprietor and the gun goes off acciden­
tally in the course of commission of the robbery, he is guilty
of first degree murder under what I understood to be classical

24

felony murder law.
MR. LAYMAN:

Ohio presumes the intent or infers

the intent that you would say is lacking in your example.
In other word.s, if you can show the common lav;
scheme of a felony murder, then the Ohio law says that each
of the participants, whether or not there was a trigger man,
has that intent or that purpose but you have to find that they
were part of it and that it was reasonably foreseeable that
force would be used.
QUESTION;

What intent?

The intent to kill or the

intent, to rob?
MR.. LAYMAN:
QUESTION;

No, the intent to commit an. offense.
What do you think of this instruction to

the jury, "It must be established in this case that at the
time in question there was present in the mind of the Defen­
dant specific intent to kill Sidney Cohen."

Does that mean

what it says or not?
MR. LAYMAN;

You have to find the specific intent

through an inference coming through aiding and abetting and
felony murder rules.
QUESTION;

Somebody has to have had the specific

intent to kill.
?4R„ LAYMAN:

Right.

But you can presume that from

all the facts and circumstances in the crime itself which •—

Does not the record tell us

why she did not go into the pawn shop?

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And does that not suggest she really did

not expect the man to be killed?
MR. LAYMAN:

I do not believe necessarily.

There

could have been other witnesses there, other people who knew
her from that pawn shop.

I do not think that is a total

answer to that.
Turning to the mitigation phase, I would like to
point out to the Court that the Ohio Supreme Court in a number
of cases has substantially broadened the initial conception or
definitions of mental deficiency and psychosis and I point
them out in my brief.

They are specifically State versus

Black and State versus Bell, where they broaden the interpre­
tation and while it is true that you take all these factors
in consideration in. reaching the — one of the three specific
statutory grounds for mitigation, the Court does consider them.
They do consider each one of the factors that the

26

Petitioner complains of, the ace., the mental state, the de­
gree of participation -- all work together in reaching one of
the statutory grounds and 1 would ask this Court to compare
this framework, Ohio's framework with that of Texas wherein
any evidence of mitigation was not in and of itself a basis
for mitigation but had to be utilized in answering a specific
question and in

Jurek it was whether or not the Defendant

would be a continuing threat to society.
Each one of those factors was not in and of them­
selves significant, the degree of participation or the age or
youth cr the mental state — but they were all taken in consi­
deration through the judicial interpretation of the statute
and I would ask this Court to do the same thing ttfith regard
to Ohio.

Ohio does consider the factors in reaching their

decision.
Petitioner claims this mitigating factor never works.
Well, that is just not true.

Nathan Earl Dew was mitigated on

this very ground, a co-conspirator of the Petitioner.

But

Nathan Earl Dew was the dupe, the pawn that was directed by
the Petitioner, who planned this,, who directed them to go to
Sydney Cohen's„
She knew that there was going to be a likelihood of
force, of violent force :.n reaching the robbery and in carrying
out the robbery and therefore you have the rule, at least in
Ohio, the felony murder rule and the fact that aiders and

27

abettors are punished, equally with the principal.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Layman, are you saying that she had

knowledge that Dew did not have?
MR. LAYMAN:

Nof I am not suggesting that but she

is the one that was the mastermind in the crime.
QUESTION:

Under the statute, how is there a prin­

cipal way to differentiate between the two, give her the
death penalty and not give it to Dew?
MR. LAYMAN;

Because in considering, as Black de­

fines the third negating factor, the mental state, the
emotional state and the degree of participation in it, she
was the mastermindi she directed this person and you look at
Nathan Earl Dew's mind, his emotional state and you look at
Sandra Lockett's and she is more culpable and when you talk
about, well, do you have to intend to commit murder, intend
to kill?

I say no.
You can consider, though, that in mitigation but

it should not be in and of itself the mitigating factor but
it is considered in Ohio's framework in 2929.04(B), when you
consider the nature and circumstances of the crime as well
as the history, character and condition of the defendant.
QUESTION:
pation?

May I ask you about degree of partici­

You say the Ohio court may consider it.

It does not

fit within the language of any one of the three specified
mitigating circumstances, does it?

If so, 'would you point

28

the language out to me?

We talked a good deal today about

the third mitigating circumstance, that is, that the offense
was a product of psychosis or mental deficiency but under
which one of those terms would you include degree of partici­
pation in the crime?
MR. LAYMAN:

Well, I think it could be considered

under any one of them in that, in reading the first part of
it under the first paragraph of B, when you consider the
nature and circumstances of the crime in reaching this and
was this a
QUESTION:

Was the jury so instructed in this

case specifically?
MR. LAYMAN:

Your Honor, the jury does not take

part in the final sentencing.
QUESTION:

Right but I have not checked the

opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court since you made this point
but did the Ohio Supreme Court in this case construe either
one of these terms, psychosis or mental deficiency as in­
cluding degree of participation in the crime?
MR. LAYMAN:

The Ohio Supreme Court did not make

an express determination on that issue but I am saying that
you can consider all of the evidence —
QUESTION:

la it the decision of the Ohio Supreme

Court that it does so include degree of participation within
the language of the statute?

29
MR. LAYMAN:

Not those specific terms, as I stated

in State versus Black was the most recent broadening -— it
talked about the mental state and the things that go into
your mental state or your emotional state and I would like to
point out that it seems to me that you can consider

whether

there was a cold# calculated plan by the Petitioner to carry
out a crime as opposed to some biaarre behavior or some un­
planned kind of behavior and look at the degree of partici­
pation in that sense in reaching the mental state or the
emotional state of the defendant»

are telling us?

Is that what you

30

MR. LAYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Layman, I should not, perhaps,

dwell on this but what about idle disparity between Parker
and Lockett?

How can the State of Ohio conclude that

Parker did not commit aggravated murder and that Lockett did?
MR. LAYMAN:

Your Honor, I think that is answered

in Gregg and the other cases in terms of the necessity for
plea bargaining, court-approved plea bargaining and when you
are considering that, you are considering something different
than what is before this Court today.
The use of mercy, the use of plea bargaining are
as I understand it, not t.he same kind of considerations as
you have in this case.
QUESTION:

That has accepted a plea from him

which necessarily was a determination that he did not commit
aggravated murder, was it not?

And now in a separate pro­

ceeding out of the same incidents taking the position that
Lockett did commit it.
MR. LAYMAN:

Is that not right?
Ko, that is not correct because

Parker did plead guilty to aggravated murder and perhaps —

MR. LAYMAN:

have the same main charge.

You still

31
QUESTION:

What is the aggravating specification

that justifies the death penalty against Lockett and is not
present with respect to Parker?
MR. LAYMAN:

Under Ohio statute, the aggravating

specification was commuting the aggravated murder while
committing another crime and this was, to wit, aggravated
robbery.
QUESTION:

Die she have the same opportunity to

plead guilty to that lesser included offense?
MR. LAYMAN:
tary manslaughter.

Eefore trial she was offered volun­

During trial, she was twice offered

aggravated murder without, the specification and she refused
both times.
QUESTION:

In other words, that was the same

degree that Parker confes sed to?
MR. LAYMAN:
degree.

During trial, that was the same

Before that, the voluntary manslaughter case would

only carry with it a four to 25-year sentence, much less than
even the aggravated murder case but she did not accept that
offer.
QUESTION:

Does this record show whether that —

whether her counsel recommended that?
MR. LAYMAN:

Yes, they did.

It shows that and

they did recommend it and she did not accept it and it is on
the record, at least in two instances that they wanted, to

32

put in the record, the offer has been made, do you want to
accept it?

And I do not know the rationale.

There is one

digression in the record where her mother is present and
apparently has influence on the Petitioner.
QUESTION:

Is it a correct reading of the Ohio

statute that whatever factors may have persuaded the prose­
cutor that a sentence of

four to 25 years would have been

appropriate in this case since she was sitting outside, or
whatever it might be — those factors could not be considered
by the sentencing judge.

He had to carry out the mandate of

the statute.
MR. LAYMAN:

Wall, I do net know that I would say

that those are the reasons that went into the plea bargaining,
was the strength of the c ase whether or not you could convict
the Defendant on —
QUESTION:

Well, the judge has considerably lass

discretion than the prosecutor.
not?

That much is clear, is it

The sentencing judge.
MR. LAYMAN:

I'll go to that — I would agree to

that extent, yes, once you have

got to a conviction

with

aggravated murder with a specification.
QUESTION:

Well, is it a

question of degree of

discretion or is the question that they have totally
different functions?
MR. LAYMAN:

That is, the prosecutor and the judge?
Well, obviously,, that is true.

They

33

have different functions and I do not know that that is the
kind of questions that we are dealing with when you are
saying whether or not this person has been offered a plea
before the trial and then, having gone through the trial,
whether you have the same considerations to be facing

not

only the prosecutor but the trial court.
QUESTION:

Well, it is correct, is it not,

Mr. Layman, that if the Defendant fails to

establish any

one of the three mitigating circumstances, the statute is
mandatory in the sense that it requires the death penalty?
MR. LAYMAN:

If none of the mitigating factors are

found, that is true.
Now, the Petitioner contends that the death penal­
ty is disproportionate for this Petitioner because she did
not commit the crime of aggravated murder with the intent to
kill Sydney Cohen but this totally ignores the rule of aiding
and abetting and of felony murder as at present in Ohio and
in federal case law, the cases I have pointed out and —
QUESTION:

His

point is, as I understood it, was

not that she should not ha convicted but that she should not
be given the death penalty.
MR. LAYMAN:
is considered.

Is that not his point?

That is true and I am saying that it

However, in relying on Coker and the dispro-

portxonality kind of argument, you are saying that she is
less culpable than the trigger man and I think that -that is

34

not the kind of thing that this Court can say per se —
QUESTION:

He is not talking about culpability.

He is talking about sentencing.
MR. LAYMAN:

True, but I think culpability is one

of the things you use in determining whether or not the sen­
tence is imposed properly or not, what degree of culpability,
what degree of planning and participation did she have in
this crime?

Did she bring it about?
And if this Court is to say that the evolving

standard of decency argument as well as the disproportionate
argument of Coker and Gregg is to apply, then you would have
to

make a rule where a person who is classified as an aider

and abettor or has a lesser degree of participation than the
trigger man, then you have to overturn Ohio case law on
aiding and abetting.
QUESTION:

Well, we are not involved here with a

question of Ohio law.
by your legislature end
its enigmas«.

We assume the Ohio law has been settled
by your Supreme Court construing

The question is, is that Ohio law in its appli­

cation of this case compatible with the Constitution of the
United States?

That is our question.

I mean, Ohio. Lav; could conceivably make any un­
lawful killing a

murder punishable by death and there might

be no question about what the Ohio lav; was. so that a person
speeding and hitting and killing a pedestrian would be

35

guilty of murder in Ohio and punishable by death.

That

would not solve the constitutional question of whether or
not the Ohio law in its application to the hypothetical ease
I posed was a constitutional law.
MR. LAYMAN:

I agree with that, Your Honor»

However, in this case you have a very narrow cate­
gory of murder that is before the Court,

Aggravated murder

only applies to a very narrow category of murders,

A parson

has to be either committing a felony murder or murder for
hire, a very narrow grout, of them and then and only then do
you get to the question of the mitigating process and when
you review the natura anci circumstances of the crime here I
think there is sufficient evidence before the mitigating
authority or the

punishing authority to say that the crime

committed was of a degree of culpability meriting the death
penalty.
Now, I would like to turn to the first issue, if
I might, for just a moment and discuss the Prosecutor's
closing argument.
Petitioner primarily relies on Griffin versus
California, which discussed the direct comment of the prose­
cutor that the defendant did not take the stand and did not
see fit to explain the state’s evidence.

This is not the

case here.
The Prosecutor in this case made the comment that

36

the evidence was unrefuted and uncontradicted but did not
directly —
QUESTION:

But he also said that the defense did

not put ©n any evidence»
MR. LAYMAN:
QUESTION:
MR» LAYMAN:

That is true but that is not -Well, I mean, it was an issue»
The defense attorney and the defense

did not put on the evidence but two things I would like to
point out:

The Prosecutor’s comments ware not objected to

at the trial and there was an instruction given regarding
the defense failure to testify by the trial court that they
could not take that into consideration which was directly
contrary to the Griffin instruction which they were told that
they could take —
QUESTION:

While not involved in this case it

has always been very interesting to me that the only person
that can comment on the failure to

take the witness stand

is the judge, specifically the instruction,»
MR» LAYMAN:

But in relation to this, the state

would urge that first there is a waiver issue

under Estelle

and additionally that it would be harmless hera»
Either one of these factors would ha sufficient
to refute the Petitioner’s comment.

However, I do not be­

lieve that even in and of itself that the comments ware such
that they were error.

I think you can distinguish them

37
clearly from the Griffin case.
Now, there is one other issue, the fourth one that
•is raised about whether or not this is a new interpretation
of the aiding and abetting statute and I would submit to the
Court that it is not a new interpretation•

That is, it is

the same one as it has always been.
The Legislative Coranis3ion notes state that this
is a codification of the old law.

The trial court in its

charge, as pointed out by Petitioner's counsel, read the old
law.

The very quotes he gave you from that charge were the

old law on aiding and abetting.

Thus there is no change and

the Petitioner had notice the old law was to be applied.
I would also submit that this issue is one of
statutory interpretation and while, as Mr. Justice Stewart
noted that it is this Court's duty to make sure that the
statutes are interpreted correctly, it is still one of sta­
tutory interpretation and absent a constitutional issue which
they have tried to bring into this case of retroactivity of
a change in the lav?, the statutory interpretation should foe
followed,
QUESTICH:

Mr. Layman, may X go back to the leath

penalty problem for just & moment?

Under the Ohio•criminal

practice generally, is it normally the practice to take into

the sentencing determination?

38

MR. LAYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
In non-capital cases.

Is there any

reason why — it is correct, is it not, that that prior
criminal record is not, the court is not permitted to take
it into consideration in a capital case?
MR. LAYMAN:
consider it.

No, that is not correct.

You can

As I quoted the statute in this, you can not

only consider the nature and circumstances of the crime but
you can take into consideration the character, history and
condition of the defendant and the history clearly includes
the past record.
QUESTION:

Yes, but just for the purpose of de­

termining whether there was duress or whether there was
mental —■ just for the purpose of determining what are the
three mitigating circumstances.
MR. LAYMAN:

That is true.

I would like to point

out to the Court -QUESTION:

And in the non-capital cases it is

given independent significance, is it not?

Is that not the

practice of the judge to give it independent weight in de­
termining what kind of a sentence to impose?
MR. LAYMAN:

It is one of the factors that is to

be considered among many others in determining sentence.

It

is not just the single factor but it is given some considera­
tion.

There are guidelines for sentencing in. non-capital

39

cases just the way there are guidelines set up for litigation
fees under Ohio’s —

QUESTION:

Does that sound like s plan the legis­

lature would have adopted if it had not felt that it was
compelled to by the Furman case, do you suppose?
MR. LAYMAN;
QUESTION:

I am not —
Is that really a sensible way to go

about the problem?
MR. LAYMAN:

2 think that because the Court made

its ruling that they wanted to set up some guidelines but I
do not think that it is necessarily constitutionally-required
that it have all these seme considerations that you would
have, for instance, even in Florida.
QUESTIONS

In a capital case your judge would have

less latitude than in other kind of cases.

It is not the question of whether or

not the capital sentence will be imposed.

It is the question

of whether or not one of these three mitigating circumstances

basis for mitigation, you

have to answer the question, is

QUESTION;

i

Do you think the trial judge in Ohio

has as much discretion as the trial judge in Texas in deciding
whether or not to impose the. death, penalty?
MR. LAYfiAN;

Yes, sir.

I would also like to point

out to the Court that the trial judge here has the benefit
of a psychiatric report, presentence investigation — he has
a great decil of information to work with in making his
•i '

7

decision and it is required by statute that the trial court
have these bases for making his decision so that the court
does have sufficient information to look at the background
£vnd the condition of the defendant and that is apparent in
this record where we can see that the presentence report,

41
the psychiatric examinations were all placed in the record
and were considered by the trial court.
If I might quote Justice Stewart in closing.

In

Gregg, Justice Stewart stated that "There is a heavy burden
which rests on those who attack the judgment of the representative of the people and a caution is necessary lest this
Court become the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility throughout the country."
And I would suggest that this admonition applies
equally well in this case because we have a state that is
not exactly like any other state.
It is not exactly like Florida.

It is not exactly

like Georgia or Texas but. it provides mitigating factors
which channel the discretion, give guidelines to the senten­
cing authority and I thirk that, it is sufficient to say this
case is not one of a mandatory death sentence.
It gives sufficient guidelines to make the decision
to the sentencing authority.
Thank you.

Your opponent

Texas judge that the standards, that if we follow the Jurek
case, we have to affirm this conviction»
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I disagree entirely.

The dialec­

tic is the same — that is, I disagree with counsel entirely.
The dialectic is the same.

That is, in Jurek, all

of the background factors were considered relevant to s sta­
tutory question —- that dialectic is the same — but it makes
all the difference in the: world whether the question is a
broad question or a narrow question.
The question in Texas of whether or not the
defendant is likely to commit acts of dangerousness in the
future, that is a broad question that opens up the defendant's
who3.a life and in fact, virtually anything is relevant to
that but the question under the Ohio statute,

whether the

victim induced the killing — what does the defendant's
background have to do with that at all?
Whether or not the defendant was under duress —
the defendant's background has get nothing to do with that.
Mental deficiency, 1 will come back in a moment to
speak to Justice Powell’s question about what it means, but
what it means is something very, very narrow.

Yes, Justice Stevens, I agree that the dynamic is
the same but the problem with Ohio is that, unlike Texas, the
statutory questions to which the background is relevant is
so narrow as to cut out most of the

defendant's life with

the result that the kind of sending people to their death
is a faceless, undifferentiated mass which the Court condemned in Woods and it happens in Ohio and did not happen in
Texas.
QUESTION;
mada.

Nov, let me take that last point you

I am a little confused.

Suppose a woman hired a man

to kill her husband so that she could marry someone else.
Do you suggest that under Ohio IciW that in imposing the pen­
alty that her background would have nothing to do with that?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

Absolutely.

It would have nothing

to do with it.
QUESTION;

What if she had — what if the record

showed that on one other occasion she had been charged with
the same offense but found not guilty by a jury?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

It has nothing to do v?ith it

except if that
QUESTION:

Does it not show going to the state of

mind?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

~~ except if that is being defined

as being provocation but Justice Stevens* analysis c.f the
Ohio statute is exactly right.

Unless one of those three

44
factors is found, the death penalty is mandatory and what
that means is that every factor that does not go in from one
of those three factors cannot even be weighed as irrelevant.
Nov;, the breadth of those factors is the problem.
If one of the Ohio statutes was as broad as question number
two in Jurek, will the defendant be dangerous in the future?
The question opens up a whole life.

We would have a different

problem.
But these are narrow and that brings ms to
Justice Powell’s question.

Might I direct Your Honors*

attention to page 141 of the Appendis? in which the trial
judge here explicitly defines mental deficiency and the trial
judge ~ now, this is. Justice Powell, the tryer of fact,
the
This is/tryer who condemned Sandra Lockett on the findings of
fact under the statute because there is no jury.

The judge

is making a decision.
The judge says, "Mental retardation and mental
deficiency under the law are synonymous," and then he goes on
to read out of the DSM2, that is, the Diagnostic and Statisti­
cal Manual of the Americen Psychiatric Association, Second
Edition, the number of categories and he is saying that not
only is mental deficiency identical to mental retardation
but that if you have a score above 70, you are not retarded.
That is why we say that all of this business
about how broadly the Ohio Supreme -Court has construed the

45

statute is nonsense.
The only case in which the Ohio Supreme Court has
given a broad construction for mental deficiency is the
Black case.

It did not apply the statute to any state of

facts in the Black case.

It was simply answering a const:!"
m

tutional challenge that the statute was void for vagueness.

Whereever it has held to apply the terra mental
deficiency to a state of facts it has said that educational
depravation is not mental deficiency.

mental deficiency.

Emotional

Cultural deprivation
deprivation is not

It means mental retardation.

And if it meant more than that, this case would
have to be reversed because the trial judge who found the
facts found them on the theory that the defendant could be
found to have a mitigating circumstance and could escape the
death penalty only if

she were mentally retarded.

Mow, that brings me back to the question of de­
gree of culpability being considered and if I may speak again
to the following murder question because I think I have been
vary unclear on Ohio law as to this.
And this is a key question.
Honors asked about it.

Several of Your

I think it needs to be cleared up.

The answer is that Ohio does not have the tra­
ditional felony murder rule that Justice Stewart and Justice
Rehnquist were talking about.

;

46

If you look at page 205 of the Appendix, the Ohio
Supreme Court says that it does not»

Under Ohio -— and this

is not for aggravated murder, this is for first degree murder
et al, there has got to be a purposeful killing in the course
of a felony.
But what they then say is that any felony which
is done with a deadly weapon creates a risk of death as its
natural and probable consequence and that one who engages in
3ueh a felony is presumed to have intended to kill.
QUESTION:

Then they have a felony murder doctrine

when the felony is committed
MR. AMSTERDAM:

with a deadly weapon.

It is the equivalent of that*

Justice Rehnquist, that is, what it is is that they have a
different logic but it reaches the same result.
Most states sz,y that if you have a killing in the
course of a felony, you clo not have to have intent, you have
got felony murder.

Ohio says you have to have an intentional

killing in the course of a felony but a killing in the
course of a felony with z. deadly weapon is presumed to be
intentional killing so you get to exactly the same result and
Justice Rehnquist, in terms of the answer to your question,
presume does not mean to infer.
If Your Honor will look at page 117 of the

Appen­

dix, you will see that the trial judge in charging the jury
defines an inference for the jury and that is very different

47
from what it says about presumption on pages 118 and 119.
This is not simply an inference.
QUESTION?

Well, these are questions the court —

you know, in one opinion you will find Misstate
presumption and inference.

or confused,

I mean, I would not be willing to

take at face value any one single statement in a charge to a
jury is going to be conclusive on a state’s law -— I do not
think.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I totally agree but the point is

that every judge who has considered this case below has taken
the position that Sandra Lockett was convicted not because
in fact she intended Sydney Cohen’s death, not because the
jury could, have inferred that, but because Ohio law says
that if you engage in an armed felony, you are presumed —*
one of the judges in the Court of Appeals’ opinion said that
liability is attached to the defendant, ascribed to 'the
defendant.

This is not language of inference.
This is language that says, the defendant is

treated as though she intended killing Sydney Cohen even
though she did not and Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to the
question of, what would the jury have done if it had found
that she did not intend to kill?
The answer to that question is that this jury
following these instructions could not have found that she
did not intend to kill because if they followed the

48

instructions that they were given# they had to find that if
she engaged in a plan to participate in armed robbery# that
she was presumed to intend to kill so this jury could not
hax^e acquitted»

So what ws have is a case in which the following

MR. AMSTERDAMt
more I think and presume.
QUESTION:

Well,

No, Your Honor, it is not —- the
What X think —
they still feel that the record

reflects that this was the case and establishes’ beyond a
reasonable doubt that the Appellant had a purposeful intent
to kill.

That is their bottom line, however they get there.
MR. AMSTERDAM

The bottom line is a pure and un­

mitigated fiction. Your Honor, is it not?

That is, is not

what the court says
QUESTION:

They say that if you engage in a plan

where one of the reasonable results Would be a killing.
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, this —

Nov, 1 am just saying what they said.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Mr. Justice Harlan once pointed

out that even a dog knows, the difference between

being

kicked and tripped over and what -the Ohio statute says is
that if you trip over a dog, you are presumed to have kicked
hi .
In short, the Defendant's actual intent to parti­
cipata in a killing is irrelevant; if the Ohio Court deems

50

that death may result from a dangerous robbery, the defendant
is presumed, deemed, treated as though she committed the
deliberate intentional killing which this Court
QUESTION:

This does not distinguish Parker from

Lockett, I take it.
MR. AMSTERDAM?

Nothing distinguishes Parker from

the Defendant in this case except the state decision not to
treat him as a capitally-punishable offender.
QUESTION:
a fiction.

Yov; said very vigorously that this was

But is not the concept of felony murder a legal

fiction in the classical sense?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Your Honor, I have not the

slightest doubt that the use of the felony murder rule is a
fiction and the question, as Mr. Justice Stewart put it, is
whether life or death may turn on it.
Certainly, some fictions cannot be used in the
load.

The peonage cases held that.

You cannot forbid

slavery and you cannot say, anybody who breaks a labor con­
tract is deemed to have intended at the time he entered
into
r
it to have defrauded, therefore you can specifically enforce
it.

That is involuntary servitude.
Here we say Ohio has done the same thing.

It has

used a fiction that treats a non-murderer as a murderer and
c.his Court said in Gregg that the death penalty was apportionate for deliberate murder.

51
That is not the Defendant, save by fiction,,

That

fiction, we say, is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Professor Amsterdam, do you think it is

a fair comment to say that the Ohio legislature, creating the
problems we have here, misunderstood the Court's holding in
Furman?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Oh, absolutely.

The two authors

of the bill have said in their own article that, describing
what happened, that the statute with which we are controlled
here was due to Senate Amendments to a House version that
would not have presented any of these problems.

Of course

that is it.
QUESTION:

Well, you argued Furman, did you not?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at .2:09 o “'clock p.m., idle case
was submitted.]
