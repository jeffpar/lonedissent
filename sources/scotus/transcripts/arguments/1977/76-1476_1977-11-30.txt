MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1476, Bateson against the United States.
Mr,, Rephan, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready„
ORM. ARGUMENT OF JACK REPIIAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, REPKAH:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before the Court in this case involves
an interpretation of the Miller Act., which is of the utmost
importance to the construction industry and particularly those
contractors doing construction for the federal government.
The petitioners maintain that the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia misconstrued the Miller Act in defining
the term "subcontractor" and in holding that the respondents
may maintain this action,
Wfe feel, Your Honors, that the decision of the Court
of Appeals is contrary he this Court's opinion in Clifford F.
MacEvoy which was daaided back in 1944, and also the case of
\

F, D, Rich Company which was decided in 1974.
Also, Your Honor's» we submit that the Court of
Appeals decision for tho District of Columbia Circuit is
contrary to the holdings, of the Ft ret, the Fourth, the Fifth,
and Ninth Circuits, which have all passed on this issue.

We

4
believe these-; decisions

re consistent, with the Rich case and

with the MacEvoy case, and they are improper interpretations
of the terms' of the Miller Act.
Th© material facts are very simple.

The General

Services Administration awarded a contract to Bateson to
build an addition to the Howard University Hospital here in
Washington, D.C.

The contract was some $39 million.

Bateson subcontracted to Pierce Associates all of the
mechanical work, which consisted of the heating, ventilation,
air conditioning, and also included the installation of an
automatic fire sprinkler system.

Pierce Associates in turn

entered into a subcontract agreement with Colquitt Sprinkler
Company for the installation, of the automatic sprinkler system.
Colquitt had a collectives bargaining agreement with fcha
respondent union, and undor th® terms of the collective
bargaining agreement, Colquitt wan required to withhold
certain union dues and fringe benefits from th© pay of its
employees and pay it over to the union trustees.
Colquitt got into financial trouble, failed to pay
these monies over for the period of May, 1973 through
December of *73.

And the union trustees thereupon gave notice

to Bateson, under the Mills?.* Act-™which is required within 90

day.* after th . l;*n t of tho work in dons—and thereafter whon
Bateson refused to make payment, khay brought suit in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

5

Q

You question they have the same standing as

would th© laborers for—MR. REPHAN:

Ys©, Your Honor, wt will concede that

issue - and I think that was resolved in another case by this
Court.

However , we do maintain they are one tier down and

they are in a little bit different position than the on©
case referred to.
Q
did they not?

Colquitt did do installation work on the job,
They did not simply furnish materials.

MR. REPHAN:

That is true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

They actually performed the installation and furnishing of the
sprinkler system itself.
In the M&cEvoy case this
issue of whether a materialman

Court had before it the

to & materialman

on a

federal construction project was covered under the terms of
the Millar Act.

And after reviewing the statute and. the

legislative history, -the Court said that the bond ran only to
those materialmen, laborers end subcontractors who deal
directly with the.' prime contractor and those materialmen,
laborers and subcontractor-

3

who. lacking any express or

implied contract with the prim® contractor, nevertheless had
a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor and
who gave the requisite 90'-day notice.
This principi® is reaffirmed by this Court, we
believe, Your Honors, in the Rich case.

The distinction in

6

Rich was that the materialman or subcontractor in that case—
a company by the name of Cerpac—had two contracts with the
prime contractor.

One contract was to furnish the plywood

for the extarior of the project, and the other contract was
to detail and install all of the millwork.
There were seme other very important facts in that
case—namely, that, the stockholdings ®f the

two companies

were closely interrelated? the management of the two companies
was interrelated.

They had done work on other projects.

And

we believe, Your Honors, in that case when the Court said we
have got to look beyond tht terms of the contract to see
whether or not Cerpac was functioning as a materialman or as

e subcontractor, that the Court had in mind that distinction;
snd this was the purpose of applying a substantial relationship
test in the Rich case to determine whether or not the middle
party was a subcontractor or a material man.
I think, Year Honors, .if I might refer you. to the
opinion of the Ninth Circuit in that case, where the Ninth
Circuit said that this distinctio':? between subcontractors and
materialmen turns on -the substantiality and importance of the
relationship between 'dies middle party and the prime contractor.
Q

Deas that really make sans© to you, what you

just quoted?
MR. R3PHAN:

Your Honor, if you go back to the

purpose of the Killer Act, it may make some sens© because

l

historically-—and even the District of Columbia mechanic's
lien law limits the coverage to a subcontractor and. not beyond.
Q

Does that not make a lot more sense-“-instead

of talking about the substantiality of the relationship—to
draw the line between the traditional materialman who simply
furnishes goods to the job site which are installed by another
entity and a subcontractor who installs the stuff.» actually
puts the stuff into the ground that he can no longer lien for
because it is public ground?
MR. REPEAN;

Yes, Your Honor, I would agree that

probably makes mere sense than to apply this test in a
vacuum»

And 1 think that is what the Court of Appeals did,

Th®y misconstrued and misread what this Court was talking
about when they used the substantiality test.

The Court in

the Rich case was trying to ascertain whether this party was
a materialman or was a subcontractor, and they left to both
contracte the entire relationship between the parties»
Cerpac was doing contract work.
supplying, material.

And

They were not. limited to

And that is wh&t the Court had in mind

in that case.
The question here is whether or not Colquitt, the
sprinkler installer, was a subcontractor.

And wa fael under

the traditional view, in ths traditional definition of the
torn» "subcontractor," that Colquitt was not e subcontractor.
Sure, they were ix-.s tolling work.

They were installing some of

8
the materials on the job.

But. if we go beck to the definition

of subcontractor which this Court referred to in the MacEvoy
case, one who takes part of the work of the prime contractor,
v?e maintain Colquitt is not within that category.
is a sub-subcontractor.

Colquitt

And these terms have been, used in the

construction industry in day-to-day references of the term for
many years.

We believe there is a distinction between a sub­

contractor and a sub-subcontractor.
And certainly Congress, we feel, had this distinc­
tion in mind in the committee reports because they said a sub­
esu- contractor is covered by the act, but that is as far as it
goes.
Q

You said Congress said a sub-subconti actor is;

covered by the act, but that is as fax* as it goes?
MR. REPrans

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that was even

referred to by this Court in the MecEvov opinion too.
Q

Would that not cut against your argutant here?

MR. REPEAN;
Q

The sub-subcontractor?

You do not concade then that Colquitt was a

sub-subcontractor?
MR. REPHAN:

Colquitt was a sub-subcontractor, Your

Honor, and Colquitt would have been covered by the set.

We

are talking about the employees of Colquitt, on© step removed.
Certainly Colquitt could have given notice to Bates cm and come
in and mad® © claim under the vet,

But we are. talking about

9

their employees, which is ons step removed from Colquitt as a
« ub~s ubcon trac tor«,
Q

The employees then, in your view, are a step

removed from the subcontractor materialman.
MR. REPHAN:
Q

That is correct, Ycur Honor.

What is the materialman furnishing materials

to the sub-sub?
mr„

REPHANs

It would

not make any difference whether it is employees or whether it

Beyond that they ere clearly not covered.

Of course th® difference between the employees

and th® materialraan is tns ©mploya&s war© doing work on th©

MR. REPKAN:

think the- distinction is it >.}?.. :: t h*re if you look at th®
language of the statute itself.

MR. REPHAN::

T! 2 sub-tub was protected, Your Honor,

and that is what Congress said in the committee report.

And

l think if we analyze the Miller's requirement, this would
support our position.

The statute requires only those parsons

having a direct contract with a

subcontractor to give notice,

and only to the prim contractor.
subcontractor such as Pierce hex©.

This would leave out a
Pierce in effect would

have no notice that Colquitt had not paid their employees.
The notice would go to the prime contractor.

Pierce of

course is one of those protected parties under -the Miller
Act.

Pierce has a direct contract with the prims contractor

and therefore is expressly covered under the act.

And the

question that arises in my nind, Your Honors, is, Why them did
Congress not provide that: those tiers below that first-tier
subcontractor give notice give notice to the subcontractor so
that he could protect himself?
In fact, in this :ase, if there is going to be a
double payment, it would be by Pierce Associates, the firsttier subcontractor.
I think ifc is important for the Court to carefully
read tbs Rich decision because I think the Rich decision—-and
again I think-too that all of the cases which were cited in
the Rich case, 1 believe in a footnote, on the principle
relied on by the Court to define the term "subcontractor"
involved a situation v/uaro bias party w.? worn talking about,

11

of contractual relationship with the prime.
There are cases where you have a prime contractor.
You have another corporation.

It may be a wholly owned

And the courts in those cases have more

or .less pierced a corporate veil.

They do not fee I where you

have a wholly owned, controlled subsidiary—it has no
economic reality-—that a, prime contractor should b® able to
put this barriar in there and push the materialman and
laborers down one tier and therefore exclude them from the
coverage of the act.
Q

What if Pierce had gone to Bateson and said,

”We do not think we air® going to be able to do the sprinkler
work, and wo want your permission to assign that part of our
subcontract to Colquitt” and they, the same situation
developed?

had

Would the parties be in any different position

for Miller Act purposes?
MR. REPHANs

Yes, Your Honor; in that situation they

would be because Colquitt then would have a contract with
Bateson, and vs think this is what the Court is talking about
when they tnlk about those few contractors—

Q

I would not think that would give Colquitt a

contract with B&toson,

Butason would have notice tint—and

would have consented to an assignment from Pierce to Colquitt.
MR. RBPH.AR;

If Pierce assigned a. portion of its

12
contract work to Colquitt., then it. would seem, Your Honor, that
Colquitt would stand or;, the asm© contractual tier then with
Pierce»

They would have a contract with Bateson»

They would

look to Bateson for payment.

Bateson could then control

them and protect themselves.

They could say to Colquitt,

”Ws went you to put up a bo:ad.“
could not

And of course if Colquitt

make the bond*. Bateson would then have its choice

not to permit the work to be done by Colquitt.
Q

In this case Colquitt, looked only to Pierce

for payment?
MR. REPHAN:
Q

Yes,- Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

Did they not submit their payroll to—

MR. REPHAN:

That is true,- Your Honor, but that is

s. requirement of most all federal construction projects today,
that the payrolls go through the general contractor to the—
Q

The issue here is whether the Court In slow was

correct in holding Colquitt to bs a sub, not a sub-sub,
MR. REPHAN:

That is true. Your Honor.

T! .ay said

that technically Colquitt was a sub-sub contractor•
they in affect said this makes no difference.

Q

They said

within the Miller Act.
MR. REPHAN:

But th-i

iil

In fact, in

iclquitt therefore was a subcontractor
That was their conclusion.

That is true, Your Honor.

You will note

In the Court of Appeals opinion too, on page—I have the slip

13
opinion--on page 4 they said, "In the case before us the
union’s contract was with Colquitt” which was technically a
sub-subcontract.

But then they went on and reached the

conclusion that they were a subcontractor.

We take issue with

that, Your Honor.
Q

You must, yes, because if he was a sub, you

would not be here.
MR. REPHAN:

We would not be here, Your Honor.

I think one: leading case the Court should look at
is the Elmer case, which was the Fifth Circuit case -

That

case followed MacEvoy, and they discussed MacEvoy in there,
and this precise issue is there,

road it is simply a question

of whet did Congress? mean, vnen t.. r.y urrd the terra "sub­
contractor"?

Were they speaking about the traditional sub­

contractor , one having a contractual relationship with the
prim© contractor?

Or arc they talking about any person who

does both labor and material as distinguished from u pure
materialman?
Q

I do not; find in the briefs any discussion of

what the normal rule is in the mechanic’s Xian law cf the big
commercial states like Now York and Illinois and California.
k-.auId the employees of a sub-subcontractor normally be
entitled tc protection under star a mechanic's lien law in
situations like that?
MR. REPHAH:

u
jurisdictions that I did check out were th© local jurisdictions,
Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The D.C.

1 know you sty D.C., they do not—

MR. REPHANs

D.C. has a definition of the term

"subcontract" in the statute itself.
the D.C. Code.

It is Section 33-103 ©f

And it is defined as any person directly

simp .toyed by the original contractor as a subcontractor,
materialman or laborer to furnish work or materials in the
completion of work contracted for as aforesaid.
Q

I understand that, is the rule in -th® District.

Do you h&va any idea what the law generally is?
MR. REPKAN:

Generally, Your Honor, ray own experience

has been it only goes down to that first level.

No slight- intended, Mr. Justice

We had our hands full hers with th© District

We thought this is where w« need soma clarification.
Q

Is it usual for the main contractor to require

hia own ooncsentf for subcontracting?

MR. SEPHAM:

In tlie cc.:. or acting procedures, Your

Honor, normally the—the big contractor is your mechanical,

15
electrical, the concrete or structural—imless the general
contractor doss that-—and that is 95 percent of the wo^k.
Q

How about in this case?

MR. REP HAN

in this case, I think the automatic

sprinkler work is sort of a specialized work.

Most mechanical

subcontractors will not do it.
Q

Was the subcontractor free to sub-sublet to

anybody else?
MR. REPHAN:
Q

True.

True, Your Honor.

Without the main contractor having anything to

say about it?
MR. REPHAN:

MR. REPHANs

They could have required a bond here,

Your Honor, but it is clear also bhe.t Colquitt could never
have obtained a b rad.

And this is on® of the problems.

As

you got down in the lower tiers, these people simply are not
bondable.

Thar a is no way you are going to ba able to get

bonds further down.
Q

They are usually a small company.

If Bateson leaves it. to Pierce to do the

at®chemical and leaves Piero* free to sub out part of the

16

mechanical, they more or less run that risk, do they not?
MR. REPIIANj

That is right.

They could not require

Pierce to secure bonds from all of their sub-sub people.
They had no privity with those people.
Q
did they not?

But they did require Pierce to provide a bond,
And would not Pierce, if it had known-—Pierce

is really the on® who is going to get stuck here, iu it not?
MR. REPIIAH:
Q

That is true, Mr. Justice Stevens.

And if Piercs had realized how the Court of

Appeals was going to decide this case, it pretty surely would
have required a bond from Colquitt, would it not?
MR. REPHAN:

They would have, Your Honor.

Of course

they were relying on what they believed to be the law at the
time, the E Irruar case and the other cases end the way they
interpreted the decisions of this Court.
Q

The law as it was then was that they would still

be stuck if Colquitt went belly up.
MR. REPHAH:

As a practical natter, Your Honor, the

only way that scateone in Pierce';.' position could protect
themselves would be to withhold payment from Colquitt.
this is really contrary to the intent of the Miller Act.

And
The

subcontractor simply cannot afford to wan these jobs if the
big subs are going to hold up their payment.
cnly way they man finance

t'

And that is the

jobs, and ibis ia tho only way

as a practical matter I think that a major sub, such as Pierce,

17
could protect itself.

Colquitt was not foondable.

In fact.,

•share was a requirement under the collective bargaining
agreement that Colquitt put up a bond to protect the trustees
on the very payments which are in issue ir this case.

The

trustees waived this bond requirement, and they admit that
the reason they waived it, there was no way Colquitt could
secure a bond.

And this is the problem.

What, would happen

is that the industry is going to be limited to those, people
who have the financial and sis® ability to man these greater
projects.
We believe, Your donors, that when we are talking
about those few contracts that the general contractor can
protect himself against, wo are speaking of the major sub­
contractors , the mechanical, the electrical.

But you have

come very specialized sub-s'ub-subcontractors, particularly on
the federal projects that are being constructed today-—security
systems, security glass, locks for the jail, and it goes on
down the line.

These are being furnished and installed.

Theoretically they could come within the definition of subcontractor as defined by the D.C. Court- of Appeals.

But we

think that Congress never intended that the prime contractor
mould have to protect him ;sl£ aguinst these many hundreds of
small subcontractors.
Q

Cour-eel, is it not fair to say though, counsel

did generally intend to provide, the same kind of protection

18

that would b© available under a state's mechanic’s lien law
if it were not for this argument of immunity of the federal
government.
MR. REPHANt

Mr. Justice Stevens, that is exactly

correct.
Q

So, is it not relevant to know what the general

practice is throughout the country on this sort of problem?
Nobody seems to hev© talked about it, and I do not mean to
single out any one jurisdiction.

But is that not what

Congress was trying to do?
MR. REPHAN:

That is exactly what they were doing.

Your Honor, because there was no way you could enforce a lien
against government-owned property.

A mechanic's lie a law, you

enforce your lien by ordering a court sale of the property.
This could not be done

1« the caw* of fedsrally-owsad

property.
As I said, Your Honor, the jurisdictions that I am
familiar with all have scans limitations, and traditionally I
think it has only genie down to the first tier, subcontractors.
It Is that way in the District of Columbia.

It is that wav in

Virginia, and I think it is that way in Maryland.

And it. seams

to us that this was what Congress was replacing when they
enacted the. Miller Act.

And certainly when they put limiting

But the Millar Act goes one tier further than

mechanic's lien laws.
Q

It says any—

Most state, mechanic's lien laws do not pay off ,

MR. REPHAN:

No, Your Honor.

I was reading her® in the D.C. Cod©.

That is exactly what
It is any person

directly employed by the prim© contractor only—his employees,
his subs, his materialmen.

That is as far as it goes.

I

think this is true in Virginia too.
In the Miller Act we have those people who have a
direct contract with the prime contractor.

That would include

the laborers of the prime contractor, the material suppliers,
and the subcontractors.

Than we have any person having a

direct contract with « subcontractor.

So, it would be the

material suppliers, the sub-subs, laborers to a sub.

It becomes even more difficult though in a state

like I think Virginia find Maryland where the general contractor
has paid the subcontractor.

This will extinguish the mechanic's

lien rights, so that the rights ar© somewhat limited.

And it

was quite obvious that this is what Congress was attempting
to do and, as Your Honors realise, it started with the Heard
Act, which was the forerunner of the Miller Act.

However,

the proviso was interjected into the Miller Act, and. this is
what the Court had to interpret in the MacEvoy case•
Following MacEvoy, as I mentioned earlier, there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. CAPUANO, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CAPUANO;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
If I may at this pointF I would like to respond to
Mi-. Justice Stevens before I get into my argument.

You asked,

sir, whether the state mechanic's lisn laws cover this
problem, mid you did not sea any discussion of it in the brief.
It is our view that when Congress adopted the Miller
Act, the main purpose—or, in fact, as Chairman Miller stated
in the legislative history—-the purpose of the act was merely
to correct the procedural problems in the Heard Act.

So, they

were not, adopting the Miller Act to try tc conform it with
state mechanic's lien laws.

That was the» purpose of the

And under the Heard Act, anybody who supplied

labor or material to the job was entitled to go against the
bond.

22
In other words, there is not a question of privity
involved as w© submit the petitioners—
Q

Was it not. correct that the original Hoard Act

was intended to provide a. substitute form of protection for
that?

Normally they will g© under state law by way of

mechanic's lien.
MR. CAPUANOs

I believe that is generally correct,

And of course the Heard Act covered everybody who supplied any
labor or material on the job,
Q

And your point is th© Miller Act liberalized

the act by requiring a payment bond as wall as a performance
bond?
MR. CAPUANO:

I do rocognize

that in the Miller Act a limitation was imposed with regard to

What the Miller Act did was
general contractor or v, prime

contractor to protect hisvielf from remote claims.
Q

Mr. Capuano, if Colquitt had simply delivered

sprinkling equipment to the job and Piarea!g employees had
installed it, would Color Ac’s employtss or their pension fund
have had a claim under {a} the Heard Act or (b) the Miller Act?
MR. CAPUANO;

Under the Hoard Act, yes.

Under the

Miller Act., no—because Colquitt’s employees would be

in the

ssai© situation they arc1, in in this cess.
The trustees who brought this suit are trusteed of
a jointly admi&istsfeS pension, welfare, and apprenticeship
fund.

In other words, there is an equal number of employer

and union trustees on this fgnd.
funds involved.

Actually there are three

The money that they were trying to obtain was

the contribution that Colquitt in his collectiva bargaining
agreement promised

to

make to these funds every month on

behalf of the employees to fund their pension benefits, health
insurance benefits, end eiucational benefits.
In addition, the 'inion is a respondent in this case
and was a plaintiff because Colquitt withhold money from feh©
wages of the employees, purfe of which was to go toward union
dues and the other deduction was to go to their vacation
savings plan, set up individual savings accounts in banks for
each employee.

Of coarse the employees naver got this money.

It is cur view -that what the Court of Appeals did
here was look at trim facta in the case.

For example, it found

that the sprinkler system installed by Colquitt was specifi­
cally required by Batoson:s -contract with the government.

It

found that sprinkler system was aa integral and significant
part of the whole building.

It found the work that Colquitt

did w&b performed overc a substantial period of time.
found that the work was important.

And it

And in support of that, it

showed—-or the Court poin*: id out that the work done by

24

Colquitt's employees was taken over by Pierce when Colquitt
went broke or was unable to perform anymore.
Q

All of those things could be true of an

identity that was concededly a sub-sub-sub-subcontractor,
which you concede would rot be under the tonas of the Wilier

MR,. CAPUANO:
Mr, Justice Stewart«

Well, th® point is you do not-—

All right, say it is to the ninth

You look to see whether there is this substantial

Q

And if these attributes exist, then he is

functionally a sub-subcontractor?

HR. CAPUANOs
Q

MR. CAPUANO:
persons—

No, ha is a subcontractor.

Under the prime his employees or any

25
Q

Are covered by the act.

MR. CAPUANO:

—are covered.

The reason that this

Court, in our view, adopted the substantial and important
test was because the legislative history makes clear—and the
Court has repeated it. many times as re—that the purpose of the
act was to protect the interest of those who supply labor and
material to & federal project or a public project so that they
can get their money.
Certainly if that is the purpose of the act, the only
reason for having the proviso in the act is to protect a prime
contractor from seme claims which are totally remote, some­
thing hs could not protect himself against.
Q

Do you not have real difficulty though when you

try to break it down under an abstract description like that
as to just who is covered and who is not?
MR. CAPUANO;

Mr. Justi.cs Rafcnquist, no, I do not have

any problem with that at all b@ear.isa the test that this Court
sat, up in Rich and foil owed by th-a Court of Appeals is really

no different than tests the Court has set. up in other situa­
tions—for example, r^ascr-.abl© man.

I do not believe this

test is any more difficult chan a reasonable man test.
are going to be close oases under this definition.

There

But we

submit that if you adopt the mechanical test which the
petitioner is proposing hero, what you wind up with is the
employees and other persons who supply labor and material being

26
th@ ones who are suffering as si result of delegation or self­
delegation or sub-delegation of work on a construction project.
In other words, if X rainy, in this particular case
Pierce subcontracted out the sprinkler work.

It is not at all

uncommon in a large government project where the mechanical
contractor will sub out. the sprinkler work, fee will sub out
the underground utilities, h© will sub out the shoetesta!
work, h® will sub out the pipe covering work, he will sub out
the temperature control—

MR, CAPUAHOs

Mr* Justice, if X understand your

point, it is that Rich was only diking a distinction between
materialman versus fiubcoaUr&ctor.

If that is so, we would

still submitr-although I do believe th® test goes farther than
that in Rich— -but cc would still culnvit that tlifi approach IdiC
Court uaad in Richr-ikat is, a functional type test—it;' the only
s

test that is going to accommodate tha two purposes that we

27
understand to bs in the Miller Act.

Th@ first and primary

purpose is to protect those whoso labor and material g© into
the public projects.

The second purpose of the proviso to the

Miller Act is simply to make sure that the prime contractor has
some means of protecting himself from remote claims—not
remote claims in terms of number of tiers people are down,
whether they be one, five, or t®i-., but remote in th® sons®
that th® defaulting party do©s net have & substantial arid
important relationship with tha prim® because if he does have
that kind of relationship, than there is no reason to
eliminate contractors down this?—

MR. CAPUANO s

Q

On the sub-subcontractor.

MR. CAPtlAHO;
Q

On the language referring to—

The sub-subcontractor.

That is m far as it will go»

What do you. say

about that?
MR. CAPUANO:

My answer to that would be, first,

that at bast it is ambiguous because the act itself does not
define a subcontractor.

So, with the act not defining a

subcontractor, it is difficult to assume then that the House
report, when it refers to sub«subcs;niractor, was referring to
a definition which the petitioner urges here.

In

other words, I think the functional definition

that this Court laid out in Rich is a more appropriate on©.
Furthermore, X believe that”—again as this Court hac pointed
out many times—there is «ess-tensive legislative history on the
other side of this problem.

And that is the legislative

history and in fact comments by Chairman Millar, one of which
I mentioned earlier, that the basic purpose of the Miller Act
was rearsiy to straighten out these problems with the Heard
Act.

With that being repeated ever and over again in the

legislative history.» X find it. difficult to attribute to
Congress by that ono statement in the House report e wholesale
elimination of classes of poopla who were previously covered.

29

In effect^ t© adopt that statement as sonm kind of controlling
criteria would moan that Congress decided they were going to
cover just the tip of the iceberg and eliminate all these other
people who had previously been covered.

I believe that before

we could look at that: statement as controlling, there would
have to be far more legislative history similar to -that or at
least; defining what they meant by subcontractor in that case*
If I may, the point I would like to make with regard
to the remoteness argument--and

believe X partially got into

it, but I would Ilk© to stress the fact that I do not believe
that Congress can be assumed—or it cza be presumed that
Congress intended, when it adopts id the Miller Act, to let
coverage under that; act bs control led by the con-tractor» who
are on the job.

And basically if r® adopt petitioner's

contention, that is what happens.
If Pierce decides to do the work himself, Pieros Js
employees are covered,

If Pierce decides to subcontract that

work t© Colquitt or scaiefcpdy elci; to d© the work, Colquitt's
employees are not covered.
Q

What you say Congress did not intend in the

Miller Act is tru© und$r aicwt states' mechanic's lien statutes,
is it not?
MR. CAPUANO?

Thera arc many that do that.

Thor©

are a few, Justice Relinquish, which wa have found which would
in effect support our position.

30
Q

And yet. did you not say that the Heard Act as

originally drafted was intended as a substitute for state
Mechanic's lien statutes?
MR. CAPUANOs

Yes, in 'ihe sens© that you could not

have a mechanic's liar, or a federal project, the Heard Act
provided for the bond to give the laborers and other persons
who supplied material on the jab opportunities to collect.
But I think this point is particularly crucial, that the
rights of both labor and materialman to

seek recovery under

the Millar Act bond, under the petitioner's content:.on rests

cn how much subde legation the primfc or someone for 3x::ra;pa-3- in
Pierce's condition decides h@ «rants to do on the job.

This,

we submit, is totally inconsistent with the Rich case and,
for that reason, we believe that the Rich case, even if it is
not found controlling in this situation b®cause it involves a
supplier fco a materialman, ys believe the teat itself is
sound and was stated as « general test for determining sub­
contractor under fch© Miller Act, and the functional aspects
of it. can ba applied in fchij situation.
Thsr« are a couple mor« points I would like to make,
if X could.
Another factor *h:lch I think deraenstrotes that the

petitioner's privity type argument is not valid in interpreting
the Miller Act is tit© situation wa have here v/hera Pierce took
over the job after Colquitt waa unable to perform,

under the

31

petitioner's theory of the case on the last day these people
worked for Colquitt? they were not covered under the Miller
Act.

They had no bond coverage.

The next day, when they

>
went to work for Pierce r doing precisely the same work—
probably hooking one piece of pip© up to tho piece of pipe
they hooked up yesterday—they wire then covered.
Q

Yes, but is that not a natural consequence of

the kinds of lino drawing that w« encounter in a who Is rang®
of business and commercial relationships?
MR. CAPOh.NOi

That is tho kinds of line drawing, yes,

Mr. Chief Justice? but my point :.a that line drawing, based
upon these relationships in business~~ia other words, what
\

Pierce and Colquitt want to do and what Bateson wanes to do
with them—should not be controlling in interpreting the
Millar Act because Ccngrc-ss there said, "Look, w a went to make
irnre people whose laic~ joe? into that building get paid."

HR. CAPtANC;

T-io.3® Xis.es, &.s I recollect, Mr. Chief

Justice, really are concerned more with whether someone was
prompt in getting his claim filer.—for example, whether the
work was done Monday or Tuesday—

Mr, Chief Justice, that I think the lira® drawing there-—
Q

You do not loss your oasa if—I am just

surprised that you would want to put so much weight on that
kind of point.

You do not lose your case on it.

Yes, I realize that.

But you want us to draw a line too, do you not?

MR. CAPUAHO:

Q

Do you want to let it float?

MR. CAPUAHO:
Q

ship because there is only on® re-aeon why you want to find cut
If there is that relationship*—bs.-caua® if there is uuch a

Q

Then how do you compute a. Miller Act bond

premium if you have got that . jqr. ;• a test?
MR. CAPUAHO;

The Miller Act bond premium,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is set in the act.

In other words, th©

act provides the limit of the bond.
Q

I am not talking about th© amount of coverage.

33
1 am talking about the premium that th® general has to pay
th© insurance company to gat the bond.
MR. CAPUANOs

The premium, as I recall from th©

>

brief submitted by the Surety Association, is based upon a
%

percentage of the bond.

In other words, I believe it is on®

half a percent for the first million or some figure like that.
They did also point out in their brief that they do
not compute these premiums on an actuarial, type basis.

But

again I do not believe feat is crucial because what we have to
keep in mind is what Congress intended to do when it adopted
this statute.

Certainly, if Congress was concerned, for

example, ©bout how the 'sureties were going to get their

)

premiums- ©r how they wore going to base their premiums, it
would have been simpla to say w® are not going to have any
bondsj then there would be no premium.

Q

Congress could likewise pass a law that had

rtosi® of the limitations that the Miller Act had in it and
©imply say that, anybody who has coma near th© project and has
not boan paid can recover under the bond.

both agree that

MR. CAPUAHOi

)

correct.

No, it did not go that far, that is

But. I would point out that if Congress fully intended..,

as petitioners argue, to linit tha bond to th® first year,
that would have besn very simple to say in th® proviso.
it did not say so.

But

34
On the contrary, however, if again as petitioner
argues Congress could easily have said who was covered, it
would have been very difficult to put
in the proviso.

that kind of language

You would have then had language sub-sub-sub-

sub or sub of the first, second, third, fourth tier, that type
©f language.

X do not believe we can attribute to Congress

that intent in view of that.
Q

Did Pierces file a bond in this case?

MR. CAPUANO:
Q

Did Pierce have © bond?

Yes.

MR. CAPUANCs
Mr. Justice Whits.

The record does not reflect that,

But Pierce hid an indemnity agreement with

Bateson to indemnify Bateson in the event Bateson did—
Q

In ary event, these employees have no claim

against Pierce.
MR. CAPUANQs

They have no claim against anyone at

th© presant time.

Q

No bond that Pierce filed covers them.

MR. CALPUANO:

No.

No, sir.

TIi© problem that Bateson claims exists—and that is
to get all these bonds?—that we
&r© going to be bonding contractors down the road, we do not
believe exists because there are several ways that Bateson
esn protect himself, one of ’which of course is requiring bonds.
Ho required on© of Pierce.

That certainly proves he c?:a 3s it.

35

He did not h&v@ to do it.

Piero: could certainly have

Why Pierce did not require one to

Colquitt the record does not show.

Counsel indicates it was

because Colquitt could net get bonded.

If that is so* in

effect then Pierce is telling fcho employees* "I want Colquitt
on the job"—h® probably had a low price. "Colquitt cannot
get bonded.
risk of that?

So* if Colquitt goes belly up* who will bear the
You employees.”

:: simply cannot attribute that

intent to Congress.
f

With regard to the argument that was somewhat touched
on by counsel and argued extensively in the br±e£—end that is
that the interpretation they are suggesting would be more fair
to small contract;;.*»:» * that the iy.ts-rpr@te.tdon we arm proposing
would in effect eliminate smell cor.tr&afeors from coning on
jobs because they cm*-.Id rot

get. bo:ids, and people like Pierce

from now ©n would require small contractor?: tc get bonds—I
think -the argument is not appropriate in this case, for
several reasons.
First, the small contractor can really be on both
sides of this question.

They cot: id just as easily be

claimants m they car* dafar. iters,

For ©sample, if Colquitt

bad subbed out half of his sprinkler system job to a small
contractor, that small contractor would be standing in the
shoos of Colquitt's employees and also would come up empty
handed.

36
So, I doubt if a small contractor is going to take
much comfort in petitioner' s argument that "We want to get you
on th© job even though you cannot be bonded” and then have
that sam© small contractor find out that when he cannot get
paid, he cannot go against th© bond either»
Furthermore, we do not believe that the philosophy
of the Millar Act was that th© employe® should bear the
responsibility for a marginally weak contract*

Certainly th©

federal government has provided other means to get jobs for
small contractors on federal projects-Q

But you would make the same; argument; I gather,

for Colcjui tt5 a materialroen,,
MR, CAPUANO:

Gh, year sir.

My argument would be

precisely the same for Colquitt’s- materialman, for anyone who
had & contract with Colquitt, because that is th® only privity
which the act requires, in our view.
Q

Because Colquitt, you say, was correctly held to

foa a subcontractor.
MR. CAPUAMO:

By the Ceurt below, yes, sir.

Th® only

privity that is necessary i*.$ th© privity between the claimant
and th© defaulting party.

The set does not require privity

between th© defaulting party and the prim© to show that th©
defaulting party is & subcontractor*
1 have concluded my argument, and 1 would simply like
to request that 'the Court { ifirra the decision of the Court of

3?
Appeals, which we fuel fully adopted the decisions of this
Court in Rich and MaqEvov end properly construed the Miller
Act.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACK REPHAN, ESQ.,

And we believe, Your Honors, it

is really truly an unweekable task.
As far a.;i drawing the lines, wa think this Court

Rightly or wrongly it my well ba that ’the extension of the
Miller Act should b® broadened.

We feel this is a matter for

38
Congress.

If they feel this way , they can redefine th®

coverage.

But wa think the way it is defined right now, this *

was an attempt by Congress to draw a line to shot; some
definition.

And we think the Court of Appeals decision

violates that boundary Hi©.

In effect, it eliminates the

proviso of Section 2 of the act which this Court had before it
in th© Rich case, in the MacEvoy case, and which was the
proviso involved in all ec th® circuit court opinions? who
held that a subcontractor is a subcontractor in the usual
meaning of this term.

And as the term was used in the building

trade industry, certainly this Court recognised that, in
MacEvoy, and wa think this is what Congress meant when they
