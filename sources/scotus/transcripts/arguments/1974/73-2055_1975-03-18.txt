PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll resume arguments

in Number 73-2055.
Mr. Caron, you may proceed.

You have 1? minutes

remaining.
MR. CARON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, at the close of yesterday'3 argument, I was at
the point of discussing briefly the supervisory powers of
the Commission and its Section 7(b) enforcement remedy,
which is so directly involved In this particular case and
from that point, to discuss the cases which are cited by
the Respondent in support of his position.
We have emphasised in the brief the overall
supervisory responsibilities of the Commission ever SIPC.
They are extensive and they are detailed — at least 10
specifications — at pages 10 to 12 of our brief and I would
not burden the Court with a repetition of those items.
I would illustrate one, though, to indicate the
sweep.

The Commission does have the power, under this

statute, to disapprove any by-law or any rule or regulation
which SIPC might adopt and more than that, it has the power
to compel SIPC to adept the by-law it desires to be

12
adopted and the same applies to roles.
It has the power to require SIPC to repeal or
amend any existing by-laws.
So that is one Illustration of the pervasive
control which the Congress has sought to lodge and properly
so, in the Commission.
And there are other examples.

And we find that

Section 7(b), which relates to the enforcement of SIPC's
statutory responsibilities to the investing public — we find
that that provision Is part and parcel of the package of
supervision.
It Is clear from the remarks of the members of
Congress — or at least some of them — and we refer to
some of those at footnote 30 at page 11 of our brief that they
well understood and Intended that the Commission assume on an
exclusive basis responsibility to see that the purposes of
the Act were carried out in every respect.
1 would point to one just to illustrate.

One

Congressman, In these words, "The Bill gives to the Securities
and Exchange Commission continuing oversight and rule-making
authority over the affairs of the corporation to Insure that
the public interest is served."
In light of the receiver’s authorities cited in
support of an Implied right of action, I would focus just for
a moment on the extraordinary character of the remedy and

13
enforcement power which the Commission has.
Section 7(b) in the first instance would authorize
the Commission to substitute its judgment for that of the
SIPC board-of-directors in the event that it disagreed and
on the basis of that difference of view, authorizes the
Commission to go to the Federal District Court, where cur
prineipal office is located, and commence an action, perhaps
dsscribable as in the nature of mandamus or mandatoryinjunction but not quite either one, I don’t believe and it
authorizes the Court, after reviewing the positions of SIPC
and the Commission, to determine within some parameters not
yet established that either the Commission is correct and
that SIPC should be compelled to do something under the
Act, namely, commence a liquidation proceeding or otherwise.
And if the relief is granted, what is happening,
as I indicated yesterday, is the compulsion of a proceeding
on an involuntary basis to liquidate a broker-dealer with
all the Impact that has and in the process triggering the
release of the funds of SIPC for the purposes of the
proceeding and In the event that its own funds should prove
Inadequate, either by reason of that case or a combination
of circumstances, triggering a call by way of a borrowing
on the U. 3. Treasury.
Those are the dimensions of the remedy which the
Commission enjoyed by express grant.

14
The Receiver’s position, if I understand it
correctly, is that by reason of the broad purposes of the
'70 Act, an equivalent and duplicate remedy for precisely
the same purposes should be implied
I

and that is the term,

believe, should be Implied in favor of the customers of a

firm which may in their judgment feel that the firm is in
certain dire circumstances and that SIPC should commence their
liquidation proceedings.
It brings to bear two principal cases, really, one
on which we rely, namely, the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation case, xtfhich I refer to in the brief as the AMTRAK

On the other hand, the Receiver would focus on
J. I. Case against Borak, reported at 377 U.S.,.
Borak Is one of a line of cases.

The Receiver

also cites Allen against Board of Education.

We, in turn,

against the United States, Bivln against' Six Unknown Named
Agents, Texas Pacific against Rigsby, Pleischmann Distilling
and we do that for the purpose of attempting an analysis of
what these cases really mean.
So far as X can determine, analysis indicates that
they involve a determination of whether a remedy traditionally
recognized by the judiciary should be denied a particular
litigant who is aggrieved by the act of another in violation

15
of his statutory duties., a wrong in the traditional sense of
tort.
Allen., for example, Involved a deprivation of a
voting right; Bivens, the violation of the Fourth Amendment
right against search and seizure; Borak, a violation of the
proxy requirements of Section 14~A of the '3^ Act;
Flelschmann, a violation of the provisions of the Lanharn
Act, which prohibits infringements on trademarks; Rigsby,
a violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act and Wyandot,
a violation by reason of the negligent sinking of a
vessel — a violation of Section 15 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act.
So in all these cases, and I am certain there are
others, essentially what is involved is a wrong in the
classic sense of tort committed against one in violation of
law and the search in the cases has been whether it be a
constitutional provision, as

in Bivens, or a statutory

provision as in the other cases.
The inquiry has been, has Congress — except for
Bivens — has Congress, by presecribing particular remedies,
foreclosed available traditional remedies?

For example,

damages, recision, injunction.
Now, in Bivens, It was, in my opinion, easy
because there was a right and no particular remedy pres­
cribed.

Hence, on — I think traditional bases — a cause

16
of action for damages for an injury committed.
In all the other cases I have cited except
Flelschmann, while there were certain remedies of a penal or
civil nature, the fact was, as this Court found, that the
prescription of certain remedies was not a sufficient
indication of a Congressional intent to foreclose existing
traditichal remedies.
In Flelachmann, the cause of what this Court
described as the prescription of intricate remedies — it felt
that Congress had, indeed, intended to foreclose the possi­
bility of considering an award for Attorney's fees in an
action under that statute so that we have this discernible
thread of rationale.
I would refer to some language in Bivens and
’Wyandot.

For example, in Bivens. the Court stated,

"Historically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary
remedy for invasion of personal interests in liberty," citing
cases.
And elsewhere, it was said in Bivens, the question
is merely whether Petitioner is entitled to redress his
injuries through a particular remedial mechanism normally
available in the Federal courts.
And for that proposition, citing Borak.
Wyandot. much the same gist.

Thus the Court said,

referring to the Borak case — or the Rigsby case which,

17
Incidentally * I believe is the first case in this Court to
hold the existence of a private right of action within the
framework of the Safety Appliance Act — the Court stated —

that, as a matter of fact.

It may be earlier than

But this language I find rele­

vant .
Again, referring to'Borak and Rigsby, the Court
In Wyandot said, that conclusion was in accordance with the
general rule of the law of torts and elsewhere stated denial
of such a remedy to the United 'States would permit the
result of extraordinary odd jurisprudence of a wrongdoer
shifting responsibility for the consequences of his negli­
gence onto to his victim.
I would submit to the Court that the analysis of
Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion in Bivens
represents a very sound and correct analysis.
He said, and we quote in our reply brief, "The
notion of implying a remedy therefore, as applied to cases
like Borak, can only refer to a process whereby the federal

18
judiciary exercises a choice among traditionally-available
judicial remedies according to reasons related to the
substantive social policy embodied in an act of positive law."
There is an article which I found of interest In
preparation which is not cited in our brief.

It is

"Historical Developments" at 117 Pennsylvania Law Reviews
page 1, which 'was written in the wake of Bell v. Hood and
it doeSj in my opinion, a good job of exploring the common
law back in the 13th and 14th century England and reaching
the conclusion, I believe, that remedies recognized which are
traditional are really the old form of action

or, rather,

two, one action on the statute, the other'trespass on the
case and I think that this is really what is going on in the
Bor ait line of cases.
Rigsby Itself refers to actions on the statute
under old English common law.
We believe that the AI1TRAK case represents sound
jurisprudence as, of course, this Court believes.

It involves

a different proposition, a different >^blem.

)

It relates to a remedy entru/ited to a particular
federal agency to exercise supervision and control over a
quasi-public corporation.
Thera are many implications aiid we believe that
Congressiona£ choica is clear and ought to be given deference
under accepted principles of statutory construction.

The test In AMTRAK, as I read it, was that given
the exclusive grant of such authority, absent any clear
contrary evidence of legislative intent that a private
remedy coexists thereby placing supervision in the general
public, the statute must be deemed as granting an exclusive
remedy.
Now, we think the principle applies here a
fortiorari for reasons we indicate in the brief, one of
which is that the Commission, by reason of its expertise
and working with SIPC under the '33 - '3^ Act and the ’70
Act, is most competent, most aware of situations.
Congress reposes trust in the Commission and we
therefore think that, guided by the authority in the
AMTRAK case —■ but, more important, on a commonsense
appraisal of the '70 Act and what it attempts to do, the
Act itself, the legislative history, the effectuation of
the plan of Congress, the recognition of the differences in
the legislative and judicial branches and taking into
account all the available precedents, we do believe that
the Court of Appeals committed error, that a right may

not

be implied in the circumstances of this case.
On the second point concerning the Receiver's
standing, I would not develop that on oral argument.

I

think that the concessions in the Receiver's brief, too
one , that if he were successful, there would be no benefit to

who decide what are their rights.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Caron.

Mr. Collins,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. OVID COLLINS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The two issues upon which certiorari was granted
in this case were, briefly, first, whether or not customers

21
of a member of SIPC have an Implied right of action to
require SIPC to discharge its obligations under the Act in
spite of the provisions of Section 7(b) which extends that
right to the SEC.
Briefly., the receiver’s position on the first
issue is that it is both necessary and appropriate under the
facts of this case to imply such a right of action in order
for the customers of Guarantee Bond and Securities Corpora­
tion to receive any benefits from the Act and in order for
the stated and designated purpose of the Act to be
effectuated.
In that instance, we rely upon the case of
J. 1. Case against Borak.

We also rely upon the doctrine of

common law which is quoted in the Rigsby case which has been
referred to, to the effect that in every case where a
statute enacts — now, this is the pertinent part — enacts
a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy
upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his
advantage.
It is our position that in this instance unless
the customers through their representative, the receiver,
are accorded some remedy, they will not receive any benefits
undor the Act and the manifest legislative purpose will
"be frustrated.
As to the right of the SEC to do this same thing.

22

I cell attention to the fact that 7(h) is a part of a
section listing the functions of the SEC.

The legislative

history of the Act indicates that the Commission had a hand
in the drafting and the sponsoring of the legislation.
I suggest that that section was put in there to
make certain that the SF.C did have the right to take such
action if it chose but the Court will not© that 7(b) does not
require the SEC to do this.
If the SEC finds that SIPC has not met its
obligations, the statute does not

say it shall seek an

order of the Court but it may seek an order of the Court.
So that it seems to me —

Would

To correct the situation.

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

— to protect the client?

To protect the client, yes,

MR. COLLINS:

Yes, sir.

I think that is always

available to both the SIPC and the SEC.
QUESTION:

But If the language of the statute

was mandatory, to take your suggestion on the absence of

23
"shall," would that leave very much flexibility?
MR. COLLINS:
should have been "shall."

Well, I'm not suggesting that it
I am saying that the way it is

now worded, the customers, the investors, are left with
nothing but a hope for an act of grace on the part of SIPC
with the concurrence of the Commission, unless the customers
have some remedy in the event that both the SIFC and the
Commission elect not to take any action and I submit that
this Act was never passed by Congress to vest in SIPC and
the Commission a discretion as to whether or not they
would protect customers but rather, a discretion, as your
Honor suggests, as to the means by which they will protect
customers, so that there is the flexibility.
But now, the facts of the case before this Court
are such that they have done nothing and we have gotten
no cooperation or assistance or protection from SIPC and no
enforcement from the Commission and we have no prospects in
this case unless the Court finds that when this splendid
supervisory procedure breaks down

for whatever reason —

the customers can do something.
Now, this Act was passed in lieu of an insurance
act in the nature of the FDIC and it appeared that Congress
’was concerned that the investors would get the return of
their securities and their money that was on deposit with a
failed broker-dealer.

2k
There Is no suggestion that Congress meant this
to be a discretionary matter with SIPC and the Commission
but

rather that If they could protect those customers In

some other way, if they could effect an Infusion of additional
capital or a merger or anything else, they didn't have to put
the borker-dealer into receivership.
QUESTION:

Well, you are not suggesting that the

language of the Act can be fairly read as insuring the
customers, are you?
MR. COLLINS: • It doesn’t say that, your Honor.

I

have to simply argue that this was the intent of Congress
that Congress could have gone the insurance route but that
it chose to require the industry to accept responsibility
which had already been attempted and made them■self-insurors,
so to apeak.
But your Honor is correct, the statute does not,
in so many words, insure customers that they will be
protected up to a certain level as the FDIC Act does but I
say, as a matter of argument, I think this was the intent and
the flexibility was written in there to give the Commission
and the SIPC the opportunity to effect it some other way but
under the facts of thl3 case, they have done nothing and we
crxed .vor months to even get an indication as to whether or
not they would Intervene In this case and then finally vre
found that they would not.

I believe that is correct, If your

Here they have not argued it because they

say we won’t get to that point.
Now, as to the standing of the receiver, I have
not been able to furnish the Court with much authority.

In

the ordinary liquidation procedures, the receiver does
represent the failed corporation and It is his obligation
to marshal assets and he passes on claims and that sort of
thing.
I submit that this is not the ordinary liquidation
and that the truth of the matter is that this proceeding was
very similar to an SIPC liquidation.

Although, when we

28
started into it, we didn’t even know about the Act, but the
first thing we did under the emphatic Instruction of the
Court was try to devise a plan to get back to the customers
their bonds — that is what we are dealing with, their church
bonds and their net cash balances, which is precisely what
an. SIPC trustee would have had to do and certainly, an SIPC
trustee would have had. an obligation to those customers and
a duty to protect them and to get their property, not just
the property of the failed broker-dealer and this is what we
have undertaken to do,
Now, It is somewhat embarrassing to be cast in the
role of an Interloper here but we sincerely believed — and
the District

Court certainly agreed with us that we haS- an

obligation to seek the benefits of this Act for the customers
and we could be wrong.
It just seemed to us that — that we had not
succeeded in doing what the Court had instructed us to do
and that was to get all those bonds back and ail those funds
'

back.

We had to create an SIPC fund.

fund.

We

adopted a mechanism

■

.1

We didn’t have an SIPC

of a five percent assessment

to create a fund.
At that time, we didn't have enough money to pay
all the net cash balances.
The First American National Bank there

in Nashville

had set off over $250,000 of the funds of this broker-dealer

29
which we convinced them were actually trust funds, much of
which were these net cash balances so that when we went into
this plan of five percent, we didn’t know whether we

were

going to get that money back or not.
Some people had net cash balances, some had
deficits, some had large balances and so on.

In order to

equalise them all, we adopted this mechanism but it seems
to me that, having pursued this plan, the receiver has an
obligation to pursue whatever remedy the customers have
under this act.
Now, it is also true that the cases that the SIPC
has analyzed to your Honors involved prohibitive acts and
tortous-type of conduct, and that is not what we have here
and I have not been able to cite your Honors a case which is
precisely like this, but I say that we are not here seeking
damages because somebody violated an Act.
We are here because we understand that Congress
set up a. plan to protect people just like those that the
receiver represents here and we have been frustrated and so
vie are not seeking damages, as in these other cases.

We are

simply seeking some methods, either through the Commission
or the SIPC — we are no respecter of persons — to get the
benefits of the Act to these customers.
QUESTION:

Being what?

MR. COLLINS:

Precisely what?

The return of their money.

That is

30

all they are entitled to.
it.

The general creditors are not in

They are not going to get a dime.
We grabbed everything in sight in order to be

able to pay these people their money and the general creditors
are going to get nothing.
It is also true, I think, as Is pointed out in the
Commission's brief and in the brief of SIPC that perhaps this
won’t happen again.

There was a breakdown, as your Honors

know, if you have read the briefs, and perhaps this won't
happen again.

I am sure that the system is perfected now

but where does that leave the people that we are representing?
This is the only chance they have got and the fact
that it may not happen again is small comfort to them, plus
the fact that it seems to me that it could happen again if
the Commission and the SEC were to take the same poaltion
they have taken here.

You see, when the SEC came in and we

filed this petition, they said, well, you may not sustain a
loss.

You can sue the principals and you can get money from

them and you may not have a loss.
Well, they could say that the next time a proceeding like this comes on.
You can sue the president.

You can get money back

then and customers won’t have any loss.
The trouble with that is, that if this is upheld
and the receiver prior to any SIPC liquidation sues the

31
president and fails or gets a. judgment and doesn’t collect it
and the customers do sustain a loss,, then the customers come
back to SIPC and say, now, we have got a loss, how about
coming on in?
They say, oh, no, it is too late now.
gone way down the road with your receivership.
returned bonds.
Too late now.

You have
You have

You have done this and you have done that.
We can’t come in now.

All of that is precisely what has happened he re,
the only difference being that there would not be this
confusion about the original notice and the issue as to the
retroactivity of the Act so that it does seem to me that it
is important that customers have some remedy if everything
else breaks down.
Now, I can understand that it would certainly make
the administration of the Act more difficult if every cus­
tomer along the line was bringing a, lawsuit.
But in any event, a court has got to maice an
adjudication as to whether it is a proper case, whether the
SIPC goes in or a customer or somebody else.
The court has got to decide whether it is a proper
case.
If the SIPC comes in and says, we don’t want to
liquidate this broker-dealer now.

We think we can get some­

body to put some money in it or we think we can work out a

32
new merger, then the court can exercise its right then to
hold off a receivership and the flexibility of the Act is
sufficient for that purpose so that we don’t see that granting
to the customers a day in court, when the

facts justify it,

will embarrass the administration of the Act and that in this
case, it is necessary and it could be important in some
future case.
Thank you, sir.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILFRED R. CARON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CARON:

Thank you, your Honor.

I think our brief — our reply brief *— suffi­
ciently responds to the fabric of equitable coloration which
seems to be the emphasis of the receiver’s argument.
I daresay that an objective view of the few facts
which the pleadings disclose will not support the sorts of
breakdowns and cut-outs and everything else we discussed
here today.
QUESTION:
MR. CARON:

Do you know, Mr, Caron —
Yes, sir.

formal.

of

There was discussion both about informal and

I myself have a question as to whether or not

formal procedures are appropriate in a situation where you
have the sort of discretion lodged in the Commission which
is intended to be exercised in its supervision over us.
So I am afraid that I quite honestly could not
be definite on that point.

I think, if we must get into the

equities, there is a fair enough indication in the record
that part of the problem here was the dormancy of the
receiver in communicating with SIPC for four months after
he knew we existed..
The fact that he carried the liquidation through
to completion practically and then decided to write a
letter and ask for the remainder to pay the fees involved.
I think, though, that discussion of this sort is
not appropriate for the purpose of the important question of
legislative intent and the construction that ought to be
brought to bear on this statute.

3'1
I simply suggest to the Court that that issue
ought to be answered in such way as to hold that the ’70
remedy accorded to the Commission was meant to be exclusive
and that was a proper exercise of Congressional judgment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
