Mr. Evans.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. EVANSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case concerns the proper treatment
under the Immigration laws of that class of aliens known as
"green-card" commuters.

A "commuter" is an alien who has been

legally admitted to the United States as an immigrant, with
•the attendant privilege of residing permanently in this
country.

He has chosen, however, hot to exercise that:

privilege, at least for the time being.

Instead he maintains

his residence in Mexico or Canada, he commutes to work in this
country, entering each time on fee basis of what used to be
a green-colored border Grosser’s identification card, which,
like the bluebook that some of us know of , has changed, colors
but not name.

It is now a blue card that looks very much like

a driver's license, but it’s still called fee green card.
This is fee immigrant’s alien registration receipt
card which is issued to every immigrant shortly after he
enters this country

4
There are two general classes of commuters, although
the lines are not always easy to draw.

First, some immigrants

commute on a daily basis to jobs in this country, returning
each night to their home, much in the same way that a
Maryland or Virginia resident would commute to the District
of Columbia.
Second, some commute on a seasonal basis, coming to
this country for longer stretches of time, usually to work in
agricultural labor, and then returning to their homes across
the border, usually at the end of the planting or growing
season.
QUESTION: And those latter people could work for
one employer, but more usually would work for many employers
during the year?
MR. EVANS:

Usually, that’s right,

QUESTION: During the period of their presence in
the United States.
MR. EVANS:

That's right.

They usually will follow

QUESTION:

Follow the — yes.

the crops,

MR, EVANS:

According to the current statistics

that have been provided to me by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, there are a total of approximately
50,000 daily commuters, of whom 42,000 are Mexican aliens
and 8,000 are Canadians,

5

QUESTION:

Canada is mentioned there, is that a

very significant factor?
MR* EVANS:

Is Canada a significant factor?

Indeed

it is, because ~QUESTION: What are the figures there?
MR, EVANS:

There are 8,000 daily commuters from

Canada. There are no seasonal commuters from Canada, but in
so far “**
QUESTION:

That would mostly be in the Winds or-*

Detroit area, and in the Niagara Palls area, wouldn’t it?
MR. EVANS:

That’s right.

Mostly -- the majority,

I believe, are in the Windsor-Detroit area, but there are,
spread out over the northwest, and northeast as well, some
daily commuters•
Of the 42,000 Mexican daily commuters, about 15,000
or a little less than one-third
laborers.

are employed as farm

The rest are engaged in industrial labor, or

building and construction work, or in sales and service work.
Of the 8,000 Canadians, less than 200 are agricultural
workers.

Most, as I have indicated, commute from the Windsor,

Ontario, area to the Detroit, Michigan, area.
In addition to these 50,000 daily commuters, there
are about 9,000 seasonal workers, all of them currently are
from Mexico; roost of them involved in agricultural work.
The legal issue here is whether these daily and

6

seasonal commuters, each of whoa has been previously admitted
to this country lawfully as an immigrant, may cross the border
to work each day or each season without applying each time
for a new immigrant visa, which is the formal document
ordinarily required for entry to this country as an immigrant.
If a new visa were required for each entry, the
commuter practice could not continue.

Even if it were

physically possible to process 50,000 applications for visas
per day, the entire annual limitation upon the issuance of
immigrant visas to Western Hemisphere immigrants since 1968
is 120,000, which of course would be exhausted in less than
three days.
The Immigration authorities have followed the
practice for 47 years of permitting commuters to enter as
immigrants with informal border crossing documents, after
their initial entry —- after their initial entry with an
immigrant visa.
Th© lawfulness of that practice under the present
Act is determined by Section 211 of tha Act, which is set
forth at page 80 of our brief, and it may be worth referring
to it because the language — the case really turns on the
precise language of these sections.
Page 80, in the middle, is where 211 is set forth.
Part (a) of 211 establishes the general rule that an —*
page 80, I feel bad about that, after

But this is the

7

Appendix.
Section —
QUESTION:

It happens every six months.

[Laughter.]
MR» EVANS;

Section 211(a) establishes the general

rule that an immigrant visa is required for entry a3 an
immigrant»
211(b) establishes the sole exception to that
requirement/ which permits the Attorney General to dispense
with formal documents for, quote, "returning resident immigrant
defined in Section 101(a)(27)(B)„"
It is therefore the language of that section,
101(a)(27)(B), upon which this case, in our view, turns.
That language appears just above Section 211, at the top of
page 80.

It is one of the definitions, as you can see, of

"special immigrant"»
When it is read together with section 211(b), it
pro Ides that a visa is. not required for entry by, quote, "an
immigrant, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is
returning from a temporary visit 'abroad".
QUESTION;

So it gets down to whether he's lawfully

admitted for permanent residence, when he has a permanent
residence abroad?
MR. EVANS;

That's one of the issues. Thera are

actually two others, because the plaintiffs in this case also

8

argue that he’s not an immigrant and that he's not returning
from a temporary visit abroad,,

But it basically comas down

to whether actual residence is implied in this definition of
a person who can enter on informal documentation.
QUESTION s

I suppose we would all be more comfortable

if we had a more specific, newer, statute.

Is there something

pending in Congress to clarify this general area?
MR. EVANSs

Well, there are a handful, six or so

bills pending, which would have some impact, in one fashion or
another, upon the commuter practice.
So far as I know there has not been any reports by
the relevant committees that have been submitted as of yet.
QUESTIONj

is the Service sponsoring anything over

there for better clarification?
MR. EVANS:

But I'm not sure that clarification is

needed, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

The phrase defined in Section

101(a)(27)(B), that we just looked at, and the crucial
phrase upon which you

to which you pointed, is itself a

term of art, which is defined in Section (a) (20) , *,vhich is
on the prior page, at the bottom of the prior page and the
top of the next.
Now, that says precisely what "lawfully admitted for
permanent residence" means.

It means "the status of having

been lawfully accorded the privilge of residing permanently
in the United States as an immigrant, such status not having

9

changed."
There's no requirement in that definition, and
there’s no requirement anywhere else in the Act, that that
privilege be exercised in order to maintain the status of a
lawfully admitted permanent resident, or, indeed, to become
—“ to acquire the privileges that go with being a lawfully
admitted — a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
QUESTION: Do you think that takes care of the next
phrase, "who is returning from a temporary visit abroad"?
MR* EVANS:

No, that doesn't take care of it.

I

think it certainly bears on it, because ~
QUESTXON: Well, that language

doesn't that

language sound like someone who has gone to the South of
France for the winter and returns in the spring?
MR, EVANSs

Yes.

No question, at first blush, it

appears to refer to someone
QUESTION:

Who is permanently residing in this

country.
MR. EVANS:

who is permanently residing here and

has bean out of the country temporarily.
QUESTION:

Who doesn't have a status or a privilege,

but one who's actually exercising it?
MR, EVANS:

Well, that's what it would seem, but

whan you analyse it, you've got three words:
and abroad

temporary, visit,

10

Now, ’'temporary'1 clearly applies in all — in both,
a commuter, whether he's residing here or in Mexico or in
Canada-

"Abroad" is also without question-

The only word that

really carries this superficial implication is "visit"»
And in the context of a commuter, who is not a
resident here, there's nothing that really strains the
language to say that he's visiting whan he goes home to sleep
or goes home for part of the season.
What's implied in the word "visit", I think, is the
intention to come back to this country,

that it's a

departure for temporary purposes, with intention to returnAnd I think that that, while it's -- as the Ninth
Circuit said, there is some strain on the language, X don^t
think it's so severe that we should read the rest of -the
statute as having been intended to abolish this practice that
has been going on for so long.
Let me add also that there is
seems a little strange, I confess»

I mean, this all

But the legislative

history that underlies the Act itself makes it quite plain
that Congress was fully aware that the Service was treating
had s class of commuters that were treated as lav?fully
admitted permanent residents, although they were residing
in foreign contiguous territory.
And on pages 52 through 54 of our brief, wa have
set forth the crucial language in the report.

11

The report that I’m referring to is one that was
a product of an exhaustive study by the Senate Judiciary
Committee , that was the basis upon which the 1952 Act was
developed and ultimately enacted.
This was a 900~page report, in which the entire
field of immigration and nationality law and practice was
thoroughly examined; practices that were inconsistent with
what the committee thought was good policy were plainly and
obviously branded as improper, or that they shouldn't be
continued.

The committee regularly made recommendations

throughout the report for legislation to correct what they
thought was an improper practice.
It clearly and plainly recognises the commuter
practice.

It starts off
QUESTION; What's the date of the report?

it.

MR, EVANS:

This is a 1950 report, as I understand

QUESTION;

1950?

MR, EVANS:

'50.

!

But it was on the basis of that

report the initial bill, which ultimately became the '52 Act,
was *»“ and the provisions are basically the same.

I mean

it's an important part of the legislative history.
No mention after this report was made of commuters
in any of the subsequent reports.
At the top of page 53, we've italicised the phrase

12
"A resident alien's border-crossing identification card".
It's the resident alien's border-crossing identification card,
that is issued to an alien, so-called commuter, who has been
admitted for lawful permanent residence, but who resides .in
foreign contiguous territory and is employed in the United
States»
Down further again the same point is made»
QUESTIONS

Do you think this takes care of the

South of Prance hypothetical that I asked about?
MR, EVANS:

Well, this doesn't address itself,

obviously, to the "temporary visit abroad"»

But I think

it recognises that this practice has been in existence, that
it's not necessarily inconsistent with the language that;
was ultimately adopted by the Congress in the 1952 Act.
And I think it’s only proper to read the "temporary visit
abroad" consistent with Congress's awareness of this practice
going on, end its refusal to abolish it, or even to suggest,
anywhere in its 900-page report, that the practice was
improper»
QUESTION:
(b)

Now, let me be sure I have it.

that we're talking about was enacted when?
MR, EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR, EVANS:

Section

In what year?

211(b)?
Yes.
Wall, the original language of 211(b)

was enacted in 1952, but it has been amended, and the

13

plaintiffs —- in 1965, and the plaintiffs — I refer to Mr„
Terris*s clients as plaintiffs, because we're cross~petitioners
here ~~ the plaintiffs attach some significance to the change*
Originally, the language had read — I'm looking now
at 211(b), where the language appears, "returning resident
immigrants, defined in section 101(a)(27)(B)".
Originally, the language read "aliens lav/fully
admitted for permanent residence, who depart from the United
S cates temp orari ly„"
And the plaintiffs have argued that the change from
that language to the present language reflected Congress's
determination that actual residence was required»
In fact, no such

no such purpose can be found

anywhere in the legislative history of this amendment.

The

plaintiffs argue that a brief exchange, "obscure colloquy" is
what ‘the Ninth Circuit referred to it as, between the General
Counsel of the Immigration Service and a staff member of the
House Judiciary Committee, in which the staff member was asking
certain questions about the commuter practice and was getting
responses from the General Counsel,

They draw from this the

inference that two years later, in a bill that wasn't even
before Congress at the time the hearings, in which this
exchange took place, were commenced, was intended to be a
responso to the service's practice With respect to commuters.
Well, it's very hard to accept that, when you look

14
at the reports that are associated with this 1965 amendment,
which was a very major piece of legislation.

Nowhere in the

report is there any mention of commuters.
The reports of the House and the Senate each list
nine or twelve, what they cal3., basic changes that are going
to be made in the immigration Act by this amendment.

No

mention is made there of commuters.
The House or Senate Report — I forget x^hich
that the rest are minor and technical.

says

And it’s difficult for

me to comprehend that the relevant committees of the House
and Senate would, with the stroke of a pen, abolish a commuter
practice that's been going on for 47 years

• or, at that time,

not quite that long, but for quite’ a long time ~~ without
mentioning that it was doing it, or without specifying that
it had any intention to do so.
And I can’t believe that it would be viewed as a
minor or technical change.
There’s a contention made here, also, that the
commuters fail to satisfy the definition because they are
not immigrants, but, rather, nonimmigrants.
An immigrant is defined by the Act as "any alien
who is not a nonimmigrant", and it is, in that sense, a
negative definition.

If you’re not a nonimmigrant, you’re

automatically an immigrant.
The nonimmigrants are defined in -- which is

15

relevant to tills case

in Section 101(a) (15) (H) (ii) , which

is set forth on page 79 of the brief.
And that states that you are a nonimmigrant if you're
"an alien having a residence in a foreign country which" —
who has no intention of abandoning it, "who is coming tempor­
arily to the United States to perform temporary services or
labor®"
Plaintiffs contend that this fits precisely what
the situation with respect to commuters.
What they neglect, what they overlook, however, is
that there is an additional requirement associated with that
category of nonimmigrants, namely,”if unemployed persons
capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found
in this country".

Well, this is part of the definition.

If you can't satisfy that definition by virtue of the Act's
language at the top of the page hero, you are an immigrant.
And the Act, in fact, in other sections, in section
214, presumes that you are an immigrant unless you establish
that you're a nonimmigrant.
The plaintiffs that this means — this failure »—
they con't contend, let me start there, that there are people
in this country who cannot be found to perform the labor that
the commuters perform, they claim that the availability of
this labor simply means that these nonimmigrants can't enter.
They fall into a netherland.

They're neither nonimmigrants nor

16

are they immigrants, because if they were noniitimigrants they
could corae in with nonimmigrant visas, unless they were
otherwise excluded.
They read this as an exclusion, when it appears in
the definitional section as part of the definition; and the
whole structure of the Act is designed to make it difficult,
unless you comply specifically with the language of the
definitional statutes, to enter as nonimmigrant.

It’s

nonimmigrants who can enter without regard to numerical
limitations.
And for that reason, most often aliens seek to enter
as nonimmigrants, because it's difficult to obtain immigrant
vis as.
And for that reason the Act starts with a presumption
that you’re an immigrant., and if you can't satisfy the non­
immigrant definition, you're an immigrant.

And sometimes

that means you can't come in at all.
Well, in tills case, the plaintiffs have argued that
this is an exclusionary provision.

It's not at all, and it

wasn't intended to be.
The Act very clearly »*• excuse me, the legislative
history, to which I referred before, very clearly distinguished
between commuters on the one hand, whom they recognised the
Service was treating as resident aliens,

and what they call

temporary agricultural labor on the other hand.

17
That referred to the labor chat had been brought in
under a series of special legislation, legislative provisions
to relieve manpower shortages during critical times, for
harvesting and so forth„
And the determination *?as made that there should be
some permanent provision in legislation to permit this kind of
relief of manpower shortages.,
nut there was no suggestion that commuters were to be
put into that category, because the Committee that was
examining the immigration practice realized that commuters
were not

were part of -die stable labor pool»

here, and they carae in regularly.

They were

And they were treated under

the prior Act as having been "lawfully admitted for permanent
residence”.
It was to expand the existing labor pool that they
made this provision of subsection (H)<ii}, and it was not
in any way an effort to exclude aliens
QUESTIOH:

to exclude commuters.

Mr® Evans, this legislative history that

you cover on pages 52 and 53 of your brief, where there is an
express reference to the "so-called commuter", is there any
indication, reading that, in its context that it referred to
both seasonal and daily commuters?
MR» EVANSs
suggests

Ho, there's nothing in there that

as a matter of fact, I don’t think the Service at

that time had any clear notion of there being a distinction»

13
It's not ~~ it’s not clear from the record the
Service has kept, because in those days they were not

there

v;as no distinction made9 that there were any seasonal
commuter.

There may have been, there may not have been»

But there is nothing in the practice or in the history that
suggests that seasonal commuters x^ould have been treated
any differently than daily commuters.
Daily commuters — as I said, the lines are
difficult to draw.

Some seasonal commuters stay in the

country for some seasons and then they go back home and
commute daily for a while.

And it’s a kind of a spectrum,

It's their — the regularity

If — under the Immigration Service’s

practice, if a commuter is out of employment in this country
for a period of six months or more, he is -- he loses his
commuter status? his status has changed,, in other words, and
he loses his status as a "lawfully" — as a person "lawfully

Isn't that it?

QUESTION :
MR. EVANS:

Yes„
The Immigration Service, through its

Board of Immigration Appeals, early on concluded that the
%

touchstone of a commuter's privilege is his employment in
this country*

That’s whcit

that may even be the language

they use.
And therefore if that touchstone disappears# their
status disappears.

It has grown up as the practice within

the Service, and I don't know whether the Courts have ever
considered it or not, but that is the way it's operated
for
QUESTION:

But your whole argument, as I understand

it# is that a resident alien doesn't mean that, it means
somebody eligible to be a resident alien# in that status?

Yes.

Well# eligible to reside

MR. EVANS:

I don’t believe so,

I believe it's

implemented by the regulations.
The regulations are an 8 C.F.R. 211(b), and they

If you're leaving for a period of mors
I guess it’s up to a year, you have

to obtain a re-entry permit.

At least that’s what the

regulationa say.
As a matter of fact, the re-entry permit, if you’re
leaving for that short a time, is the green card.
But — 211(b), by the way, is set forth in the
back of

brief.
QUESTION:

Yes, at page 80r.

MR. EVANS:

But this is the administrative interpreter'

22

tion, implementation of the phrase in the statute, "such
status not having changed".
If a resident alien is out of the country for longer
than the period established by these regulations, he loses
his privilege of returning to the country, on the basis of
informal documentation. That is, a re-entry permit or a
green card, as opposed to a new immigrant visa,
QUESTIONs

Mr. Evans, as a practical matter, hex';

does tiie Service stay on top of this continuing employment?
MR, EVANS:

Well, I satisfied my curiosity about

that myself, and apparently the commuters are — are
identified by certain markings on the green card, and to
the green card is attached a form upon which information is
listed concerning the last entry, and concerning -— well,
I gather that what is done is that there are indications in
code made on these attachments, that, indicate when it was
he was last — exhibited evidence of employment.
And when the appropriate period of time has expired,
they warn him that the next entry will require new
evidonee of employment.

And if he fails to present that

evidence the next time, he is not permitted to enter,

It was sworn to on the 21st of April

We indicate in our brief that we have consulted with

the State Department at the time we prepared the brief, and
we’re told that if the matter became important at some
point, that they would consider submitting a fresh affidavit.
The same —
QUESTION;
MR.

EVANS;

Which way?
The same way — reaching the same

conclusions«
The same conclusions, the same concerns ofihe State
Department have been expressed for many, many years, whenever
the issue has come upc

As long ago, I remember in the

at some point in the legislative history of some section, an
affidavit or a letter from Secretary of State Cordell Hulls
In the earlier litigation in the Ninth Circuit, there was a

25

an affidavit there, too»

There was also an affidavit in

1964, when a case was brought challenging the same practice,
but was dismissed on the basis of standing.
There?., tee, an affidavit was submitted.

I believe

by Secretary of State Rusk»
So it's not — it's not something that has varied,
it's something that has been consistent.

It's not

it's

not necessarily an utter opposing, an opposition to any
change in the practice.

What it is is a strong feeling that

a sudden, as this affidavit states, a sudden judicial
termination of the practice which would affect existing
commuters/ could have a severe impact on our relations with
our neighbors,
QUESTION:

Of course, that's four years old now,

so it isn't so sudden, is it, necessarily?
MR, EVANS:

Well, it isn't so sudden, but it would

be sudden in the sense there would be no phase-but period,
which is one of the proposals that is before Congress,
QUESTION:

I take it that even though this affidavit

is four years old, it's still the position of the state
Department?
MR. EVANS:

That is our information, yes.

As of the

time that the brief was prepared,
QUESTION:
to seasonal

Was the decision below stayed with respsc

26

MR. EVANS:

I believe the — there's no stay that

I know of, but I believe -QUESTION:

So the practice was terminated, then?

MR* EVANS;

No, I don't — the opinion --

QUESTION:

I mean the Service isn't obeying it.

MR. EVANS:

Well, the Court of Appeals judgment

remanded the case to the District Court for further proceeding,
not inconsistent with the opinion.

As far as I knov;, no

further proceedings were instituted, because of the
pendency of this case in this Court,
So there's been no final judgment entered, directing
the Service to pick up the green cards of the seasonal
commuters.
QUESTION: Even without a stay?
MR. EVANS:

Even without a stay.

QUESTION:

Although the mandate issued, I suppose?

MP. EVANS:

I believe the mandate has, but, you

know, I believe that it's not improper for a district judge,
under these circumstances, to wait until the litigation has
com© to its final conclusion, when there is — litigation is
pending in this Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Terris

27
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J, TERRIS, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 73-300 AND
PETITIONERS IN 73-480.
MR. TERRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Perhaps the most important purpose of the immigration
laws is to protect domestic labor, and if either commuters are
nonimmigrants, or they are immigrants who need immigrant
visas, it is undisputed they cannot come into the United States.
And the reason they can't come into the United
States is because, in either of those eventualities, they need
a certification by the Department of Labor which states that
'tilera are not domestic workers available to carry out that
work.

And, in fact, the Department of Labor has determined

there is domestic labor available to carry out the work of
agricultural labor.
Now, it is possible that automobile workers, or
workers in other kinds of jobs could corae into the United
States, either as nonimmigrants or as immigrants needing
immigrant visas, if in fact there were not --- there was not
domestic labor availble to do the work -chat they were seeking
to do.
But this case involves agricultural labor, and it is
undisputed there is ample domestic agari cultural labor.
Our basic position in this case is that the statutory

28

language is absolutely clear»

We do not rely on the

legislative history*
What we do argue is that such legislative history
as there is supports our position»
The legislative history is very scant.

The 1950

Report is not an affirmation that the commuter practice was
legal»

It is part of a lengthy description of existing

immigration practices# and so what it did was describe and
describe accurately that commuters were entering the United
S tates.
I might say daily commuters at that time# there were
no appreciable number of seasonal commuters.
QUESTION: Well# if it doesn’t have that effect#
is there something in the nature of acquiescence here?
MR. TERRIS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, —
In the practice -*> it having been

described by the committee to the Congress?
MR. TERRIS:

I think that is really the government's

position# Your Honor# when
QUESTION:

They didn’t describe it -that way# though#

did they?
MR. TERRIS:

No# they didn’t.

But I think that's -~

I think that that's the heart of the government’s argument.
It's «— let me come back to that in a moment.
The government# in its lengthy brief, and in its

29

submission here, doesn't address the Service’s own description
of what the commuter practice is all about.
The Service admits that the commuter practice is an
amiable fiction, it does not fit within statutory language.
It

has said that over and over again, and it’s cited on

pages 45 to 47 of our brief,,
Their description of what the commuter practice is
about.
And so, despite the effort now to try to fit it
within some statutory language, I think it’s a fair statement
that it doesn’t fit very well, if at all, within any statute.
The basic argument of the government is that this
has gone on for a long time. Congress has not changed it.
There have been various bills before Congress at different
times to change it, and that that ought to be reason enough
*•

to allow the practice to continue.
?

QUESTIONS

What page was that, Mr0 Terris?

140,

you se.y?
MRe TERRIS t
QUESTIONS
MR. TERRIS:

No, no, 45,
We were just counting your pages, too,
Yes„

For example, Mr« Gordon, the Genera] Counsel of the
Service, says, the commuter status — and I'm quoting

"a

device of convenience", end of quote; quote, "never specifically
authorized by statute", end of quote.

30

There are lots and — there are lots of other
statements of that kind, and the most frequent description,
short form, is that it's an "amiable fiction".
Of course, how amiable it is really depends on one's
point of view in the litigation.
Let me go briefly through what our statutory
argument is.

Using tire same, the back of the government's

brief, starting on page 79.
First of all, we contend, under section 211(b) -~
and that's the starting point.

If they cannot come within

section 211(b), then they have to have immigrant visas.
Now, 211(b) starts out by saying that they have to
be, quote, "returning resident immigrants", end of quote.
Now, the government admits they're not residents*
Nov/, it's interesting what the government does to
let irce just state briefly what the statute says about
residence»
"Residence" is defined in the Act, and I quote,
"as the principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without
regard to intent,"
Now, ~QUESTIONS

When you say "returning resident

immigrants", quoting from section 211, immediately afterwards
it’s defined in section 101(a)(27)(B).
MR. TERRIS:

Yes, I was coming immediately to that,

31

Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Okayo Go ahead.

MR. TERRIS;

The government argues that "defined

in section 101(a)(27)(B)" means that you look solely to section
101(a)(27)(B) and that that definition becomes the only —
the only specification that has to be satisfied.
I suggest that at the very least 211(b) means that
section 101(a)(27)(B) is intended to be a definition of
"returning resident immigrants", and that it makes
extremely little sense to then read section 101(a)(27)(B) to
included nonresidents.
That what they have in effect done is read out of
the statute entirely the phrase "resident" in 211(b).
Now, the Court of Appeals agreed with this -- with
our position, in so far as it was dealing with daily commuters
■— I mean seasonal commuters.

But it said as to daily

commuters, that daily commuters might -- could treat their
place of employment as their place of residence.
We submit that that is directly inconsistent with
the definition of "residence" in the statute.

And "residence"

is explicitly defined, as I’ve said, to be "principal, actual
dwelling place in fact without regard to intent".
Now, it seams to me very clear that a place of
employment is not a principal actual dwelling place in fact.
The Court of Appeals also .said that some of these

32
commuters had associations and interests in the United States.
QUESTION:

Are you addressing that now to the

seasonal or to the daily or to both?
MR» TERRIS:

I’m addressing daily, because the

Court of Appeals, for some reason which isn’t entirely clear,
did not make the same type of argument for seasonals.
QUESTION:

You think the Court of Appeals cut the

baby in half, do you?
MR» TERRIS:
Your Honor.

I think that - - I think that's fair,

I think the argument, to be frank about it, I

think 'die arguments in favor of seasonals may, if anything,
be stronger than for dailies.
Because the daily commuter never even puts down his
hat in a dwelling place for a moment in the United States»
The seasonal, at least, spends a few months in the United
States, with a place which might be called a temporary
residence in some form.
Now, I don’t think that comes close to meeting the
statutory definition of a "principal, actual dwelling place
in fact", but it at least comes a little closer to it than
the daily commuter.
QUESTION:

And part of it here is that the fellow

never paid any taxes of any kind»
MR. TERRIS:

Well, the daily — no, the daily

commuter, Your Honor, has to pay taxes, in so far as he earns

33
money in the United States, but not
QUESTION:

Well, I mean aside from that.

I mean he

doesn't pay anything else.
MR. TERRIS:

That's exactly right.

And they're most

and the commuters
QUESTIONS

MR. TERRIS:

He is not

they are not eligible for

naturalization, which is of course the basic reason to have an
immigrant visa.

They are rarely subject to the draft over the

last few years.

They cannot vote, they cannot hold office.

They are essentially, for all other purposes, treated
as

— totally as aliens from outside the country, and the
* .
Service, for this one purpose, has treated them as if they
are residents of this country.
QUESTION:

But do I understand there's one thing on

which you agree with the government, and only one, that daily
commuters and seasonal commuters are really -- stand or fall
together in this case?
MR. TERRIS;

I think that's probably right, Your

Honor.
The only thing I think that can b@ said that
distinguishes them in the way the Court of Appeals distinguished
them is the different in the practice, in the length of the
practice.

.is correct,, because there is no ■—
QUESTION:

Isn’t the length of the practice,

relating to administrative interpretation of its powers,
rather weighty in the legislative acquiescence doctrine?
MR, TERRIS;

Yes, it is.

And I would like to

address myself, though, to the weight of hew long the daily
commuter practice has been in existence*
The daily commuter practice, there isn't any doubt,
in form has been in existence since the 1920's.

Now, the

reason I say "in form" is that up until 1952, and really up
until 1968, it was a — it was genuinely a pure matter of
convenience.
The government — the government relies very
heavily on an order, and I think it's quoted in the back of
its brief

it's Service's General Order «— oh, 1 guess maybe

it's in the Petition, but it’s — no, it’s in the back of
•their brief.

General Order Ho. 86, page 83.

That was an order in 1927, which authorised the
daily commuter practice.
It authorized it only for nonquota immigrants.
Now, that was critical, because what it meant was this was a
pure matter of convenience in the 1920’s,

Mexican and

Catiadian workers had the right to come into the United States
as immigrants on a daily basis. There was no quota, there was
no labor certification necessary.

36
If they had been required to get an immigrant visa
every day , that v/ouid have been an obvious burden on themf
and on the Service, and it made no point, because they x^ere
entitled to one every day»
In 1952, for the first time, there were substantive
requirements put on Mexican and Canadian immigrants coming
into the country.

For the first time, the Department of Labor

could certify that there were ample workers available, and
therefore the immigrant couldn't come to the United States.
In 1965, that was tightened further by saying
"unless he found that there were no workers available" then
you couldn't come into the United States.
In 1968, for the first time, a quota was imposed on
Mexican aliens.

Mow, that's the time, this period, whether

it's 1968 or '65 or *52, one could debate is the crucial
date.

But it's one of those dates, anyway, that is the

crucial time when this practice meant something.
Because what it meant at that time, for the first
time, x^as that this practice was allowed, was being used to
evade substantive provisions of the Act, and that's when,
in our view, on® should start to date the commuter practice.
Because, up to then, it was a matter of convenience.

Up to

then, it could be called an amiable fiction.
After 1952 is x^hen it had substantive ramifications,
QUESTIONz Well, these figures that have been mentioned

37

about the numbers of people involved, of course don’t take into
account the illegals that are coming across the southern,
border particularly, do they?
MR, TERRISj

This case does not involve them in any

way, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, do the number of the illegals, over
the years, have any bearing on what the Service did, or how
Congress reacted or failed to react?
MR« TERRIS:

Your Honor, in all the reading I’ve

done on the subject, the illegals have never been considered
at the came time as this.

I don't believe it's part of the

— that it's been considered at any time as part of the same
subject matter.
I might say on the question of the numbers, the
numbers particularly of seasonals is very hotly disputed,
The government’s figures of 8,000 coming across the southwest
border, there's an amicus brief, for example, which has been
submitted by the Farm Bureau Federation in this case, which
has an estimate, I think, in the hundreds of thousands.
It’s a matter of very great dispute, and the government
believes that it has very firm controls on the border and knows
how many are coming across, and both the farm workers and the
farmers apparently believe those controls don’t really
exist, and the government doesn't know how many are coming
across.

38

Let me go back to section 101(a) (27) (B) „
There is one bit of legislative history# which the
government has referred to# and the Court of Appeals in the
Ninth Circuit referred to# as being an obscure bit of
legislative history.
In 1963 there was a colloquy on that between the
General Counsel of the Service and a staff member before a
Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.
The General Counsel of the Service said the
commuter practice was not based on section 101(a)(27)(B)«
He said it did not come within that section# because it was
not a "temporary visit abroad".
He said it came within section 211(b).
QUESTIONj

That colloquy# I know# is in your

brief or somewhere
MR. TERRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIS:

That’s right# it's cited on page 33.
33,
Of our brief.

He said he was relying on section 211(b).
In 1963# two years later# in a bill that obviously
*

came through the House Judiciary Committee# the phraseology
of section 211(b) was changed# and 211(b) was modified to
refer deliberately and directly to section 101(a)(27)(B)#
which had previously been said not to allow the commuter
practice.

39

Of course subsequently to that the Service now
says that the language in section 101(a) (27) (B) does allow
it.
Now, we submit that in fact what the Service has
done, although its practice may have continued unbroken, its
basic legal position has changed competely„
QUESTION:

What does the record show about the

standing of your clients in this case, Mr. Terris?
MR. TERRIS;

Standing was litigated, Your Honor,

and the District Court found that they did have standing.
QUESTION; What does the record show factually?
MR. TERRIS;

The only — tine only —■ since there

was no trial of any kind, either on the merits or on the —
or on any jurisdictional question, all it has is the allega­
tions that —
QUESTION: Well, those are taken as true, I take it,
since it was on a motion to dismiss.
MR, TERRIS:
QUESTION;
MR. TERRIS;

That’s right, that's what they alleget.»
What did they allege?
Well, there were two individual

plaintiffs and the Farm Workers Organizing Committee.

The

Farm Workers Organizing Committee, of course, represents
domestic farm workers in the Southwest,

The two individual

people were farm workers, on® was a D. S. citizen and one was
an actual resident alien of the Southwest.

40
The interveners were -- those people were all from
California.

The interveners were farmworkers, domestic

farm workers in Texas.
QUESTION: All of them employed?
MR. TERRIS;

Yes, they were all —* well, there was no

specific allegation, Your Honor, they alleged that they were
farm workers.
QUESTION;
MR. TERRIS;
QUESTION:

And it was a class action?
Yes, but there was never any —
Never any determination.

A class action

on behalf of all citizens, was it?
MR. TERRIS:

It was on farm workers, originally

it was farm workers in California, and than the intervenors,
it was farm workers in Texas.
Now, in order to fit within section 101(a)(2&)(B),
the commuters have to be lawfully admitted for permanent
residencs.
The phrase "lawfully admitted for permanent
residence" is used in a number of other sections of the .Act.
In all the other sections of the Act, I think it’s fair to
say that it would be almost incredible for Congress to have
intended to have included commuters.
Let me just give one example.
If commuters are lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, it comes within a provision which states that "a

41
spouse# parent# or child of a citisen, or of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence# can enter the United States
without a Department of Labor certification

that no

domestic workers are available*"
Now# what this would mean .is that these commuters
could bring in any of their relatives# including their
children# and one would have built into this system a permanent
exemption from the labor certification requirements # because
the exemption could be passed on from generation to generation.!
Now# the government says those issues as to the other
sections can be put aside for the purposes of this litigation#
and they can be determined some other time.
But the statute says that this definition of
"lawfully admitted for permanent residence" is a definition for
the entire statute.

And the House Report says that's why

this very definition is so important.

Because it does have

many ramifications.
And we submit that whatever rule is adopted in this
case# it’s got to be a rule that will apply to "lawfully
admitted for permanent residence" for all of its uses in the
statute.
Let me go to the second, part of section 101(a) (27) (B) #
which relates to returning from a "temporary visit abroad"#
and the Chief Justice had a colloquy with counsel about whether
it goes to a visit into southern Prance.

42

That phrase actually dates back in the statute
until 1921f and there have been several cases decided under it.
And they're cited in our brief.
And those cases make clear that that visit to
southern France is exactly what the intent was, of that kind
of that provision.
It was intended — and this is what the Secretary of
Labor determined back in 1924, and that was the time when he
was the enforcer of the Immigration laws — and by a number
of other courts, to apply only to persons with domiciles
in this country, not just residence? domicile.
Mow7, it's obvious that commuters not only don't have
residences, but they clearly don't have domiciles here, either.
Let me turn now to the regulations.
We submit that even if — and of course we argue
that they don't, but even if they came within section 211(b),
and section 101(a)(27)(B), they still wouldn't be admissible.
The regulations somehow are even stronger than the
statute.

They allow a person to come — an alien to come in

without an immigrant visa, and I'm quoting, "only i

they are

returning to an unrelinquished" —■- unrelinquished -- "lawful
permanent residence in the United States after a temporary
absence abroad", end of quote.
Now, it's hard to imagine how anybody could write
language which is more clear that you've got to have residence

43
in this country*
QUESTION;

What's the — what was the date, of those?

MR. TERRIS;
QUESTION;

1957.
'57.

MR* TERRIS;

They came after the 1952 statute.

The interesting thing is, Your Honor, —
QUESTION;

So the prior regulations were revoked?

MR. TERRIS;

Until 1952, there were regulations

specifically allowing commuters to come in without an
immigration visa.

Those were revoked after the '52 statute*

There was no clear replacement as to commuters.
Then in 1957 this language was adopted.
QUESTION;

Where can we find this language in

the papers — is it oh the back of the government's brief?
QUESTION;

That's the statute, but you've got it

MR. TERRIS;

It's in —

in --

QUESTION;
MR, TERRIS;

— in your brief.
— in our

It's in our brief, I

knovr, maybe in the government's too? it's at the bottom of
page 5 of our brief.
And that phrase, by the way, occurs seven separate
times in that section and the following section of the
regulations.
QUESTION

What?

Unrelinquished lawful permanent

residence"?
MR, TERRIS:

Yes»

It’s obviously not an

inadvertence.
QUESTION:

It's from a

that’s from a Court

opinion, I think, isn’t it?
"Unrelinquished" -MR, TERRIS:

No, I think that was actually first

composed by the -— in the regulations, Your Honor.

At least,

I don’t know of a previous use of that phrase.
Now, up until this Court, the government has
consistently contended that —» has consistently admitted
that commuters don’t come within that language.

They

admitted that iri the courts below in this case, and in Gooch
v. Clark, which ic

the Ninth Circuit case on this subject,

they not only admitted it but the Court of Appeals agreed
with them.
The government argued up to now that it didn't
matter whether they came within the regulations.

It said

that that regulation was only just permissive of what «— of
when people could come in, that outside of any regulations
they could allow people into the country under the practice.
Now, that position0 I think, is so flagrantly
wrong, that’s why it's been abandoned.

It’s wrong because

section 211(b) makes very clear that the only basis for
coining into the country without an immigrant visa is pursuant

45
to regulations»
And T. think that is clearly right, and I think that’s
the government’s position today»
Now, the government therefore goes back to the
language of the regulations, and what it says is:

despite

that language of "unrelinquished lawful permanent residence",
it doesn’t mean that»

It says it’s hot artfully drawn»

That what the regulations -- and that's their word
— that what the regulations really mean is the status of
doming into the United States.
But we submit that that's ~~ that’s simply rewriting
the regulations, that the regulations are clear on their face»
Let m@ turn now to our argument that most of these
commutors are really nonimmigrants. When I say "most", the
commuters who come to tills country to permanent employment
are not nonimmigrants.
And whan I say that I'm now talking essentially of
nonagricultural commuters.

Nonagricultural commuters, who

come to an automobile plant in Detroit, or some other plant
all through the year, to permanent employment, are not non­
immigrants .

That is clear under the statute.

QUESTION: Well, how about an agricultural worker
who goes from Mexicali to Calixco, isn’t he in the same spot?
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIS:

No.
Agricultural 'workers, I think, would

46
~~ perhaps some rare exception ->*• do not have permanent
employment in this country,

They come for a few months, and

generally not even to the same employer, as has been
described before.
They have a lot of different employers,,

They only

come for a few months a year, then maybe a few months later
on.

I think it’s very clear that what they are doing

come to the United States temporarily.

they

They do not come for

permanent employment,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. TERRIS:
QUESTION:

Now, section 101(a)(15)(H) —
Where do you find in the regulations,

or the statute, the support for the'distinction you make
between a fellow who works for the Ford Motor Company, let us
say, in Michigan, coming from across'the border, and some
other kind of a worker?
MR, TERRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, our argument as to

— as to if they’re an immigrant, there is no distinction.
I want to be clear about that.
QUESTION:

The argument I’ve made ---

The argument you’ve just been making

would apply to both of them?
MR, TERRIS:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

The only —*• the

only difference that would apply to them is that an automobile
worker might •— and I don't, know the answer to this — might
be able to come into the United States

47
QUESTION:

As a nonimmigrant»

MR, TERRIS:

No*

as an immigrant, because he may

be able to get a Department of Labor certification.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

QUESTION:

The shortage certification.

MR. TERRIS:

That's right.

So that's the only difference, if we assume that
they are immigrants.
If they are nonimmigrants, my argument is based
squarely on the language of subsection (II) , and let me just
QUESTION:

Which, is what?

HR. TERRIS:

Well, let rue get the exact citation.

It's on page 79 of the government's brief.
It's 101(a)(15)(H).

Unh-hrnh.
Then we drop down to double-*!# "who

is coming temporarily to the United States" —** he certainly
is corning just temporarily

"to perform temporary services

or labor".
Nov?# that requiras both that you come temporarily
and that the services or labor b© temporary.

It’s baen

interpreted by the Service, and we do agree with this# that
if a parson comes to the United States temporarily but to
carry out permanent services or labor# he i's not a nonimmigrant.
So a daily commuter# who comes across the borderdaily# and that his visit is temporary# but if he works in an
automobile plant on a permanent basis # is not a nonimmigrant.
I think we
QUESTION;

Well# ho» can you come temporarily to

perform permanent services?
MR. TERRIS;

Well, you com© — you come many times

temporarily# but the job is a permanent one# Your Honor,
That is -the Service’s interpretation of that phrase# too# and
we do agree with it.
New# what -the Service says# however# is that's
not the end of the definition# that the end of the definition
is "if unemployed persons capable of performing such service
or labor cannot be found in this country.*'

49

Now, we submit that isn't part of the definition,
that the definition is the description of the people themselves,
and not the rule which is clearly —» which is really
analogous to the rule for immigrants, which is in section
212(a)(14), which says to an immigrant that if you can’t
get a Department of Labor certification you can’t come into
this country.
That — this is the analogous provision for non­
immigrants .
If the Service's position were correct, it would
mean that different kinds of people coming in the same way,
same temporary basis, some of them could come in as non­
immigrants ~~ some of them would be nonimmigrants, some of
them would not be nonimmigrants.

Purely depending on the

kind of occupation that was involved, and even the time of
year.
There would be no — in effect, it would be no
general classification of nonimmigrants.
And we submit that the definition is the beginning of
this phrase, the latter is the condition upon which you can
enter.
QUESTIONs

Your argument, if I’ve followed you,

and I won't vouch for that at all, if I followed it, there are
really -three categories?

the daily commuter, the seasonal

fallow, and then the man who comes every day on a substantially

50

permanent: basis?
MRa TERRIS;
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIS:

I think that’3 correct.
Three different categories.
I think that's really correct.

QUESTION: And you think the first two categories
must stand or fall together, and the third is outside the
reach of this holding? is that correct?
Is the third within the Court of Appeals holding?
MR. TERRIS:

The reason the third —- the third is

— I think it's fair to say that the third is like all other
daily commuters allowed to keep coming into the United
States.
The only —- the third category that

Your Honor

stated correctly, is part of the daily commuter category.
There are no seasonal commuters that come «■— by definition,
a seasonal commuter isn’t a — can’t foe permanent.
And so it's part of the dailies.
We have never litigated anybody, of course, but
the agricultural workers.
And so ■—
QUESTION: So this third category is outside the,
vale?
MR. TERRIS:

The litigation.

I -chink it's really

fair to say it's outside the litigation.
Now, I don't want to, however, ignore it such that

51
it might say that I don't think about it,
QUESTION:
MR, TERRIS:

Did the Court of Appeals deal with it?
No, Your Honor»

Let me -- let me tell

you — let me explain what happened on that.
The Court of Appeals only dealt with these first two
categories, seasonal and daily.
We then said we thought, based on their wording in
describing dailies, we thought that what — the way they
described dailies, that they meant the dailies who have
permanent jobs could continue to enter tine United States,
but that they didn't mean to allow dailies who were agricultural
workers to do so.
And we asked for clarification in a motion after the
judgment.
The Court of Appeals refused to give clarification
and said that it had given —• it had "< explained itself
enough, and that the District Court could deal with that
question on remand, oh the basis of the Court of Appeals
opinion.
QUESTION:

In other words, "we writ© them? we don't

explain them".
MR. TERRIS:

Well, I'd rather not characterise

that, Your Honor,
[Laughter,]
MR. TERRIS;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well. Thank you.

You’ve got about three minutes

do you think you

can clear this all up in three minutes for us?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR, EVANS:

Surely.

I thought I had done that

originally.
[Laughter]
QUESTION:

Well, then perhaps your brother confused

us,
MR. EVANS:

There is

addressing this last issue

first — no legal difference between any of these
categories, call them three or call them two.

I understand

tdiere to be two.
A daily commuter is someone who comes to this
country regularly on a day'-by -day basis.

As I say, the lines

are frequently hard to draw, sometimes they come twice a
week or three tines a week rather than daily? but they are
regular commuters.
..Some of them come to permanent jobs.

Some of them

come to look for employment every day, or to look for
temporary employment.

It matters not, because the only

reason that would male© any difference is,if you agree with
the plaintiffs’ contention here, that these people must be
treated as nonimmigrants if they're coming to perform

53
temporary service.

It just doesn't work.

The definition includes what Mr. Terris would like to
read as an exclusion.

It is part of the definition that if

there are people available to perform this labor, these people
are not nonimmigrants, they are immigrants.

And the only

way they can come into this country is either with an
immigrant visa or with an informal documentation like a
green card.
So there are two classes, as I see it»
they are indistinguishable.

I think

The government's position, as I

understood Mr. Terris’s to be, is that they stand or fall
together.
The only conceivable distinction, aside from -the
notion that one class is nonimmigrants and the other isn't,
is that the one practice has lasted longer.

But the practice

is not — the seasonal commuter practice grew up, really, at
a tints after a series cf temporary measures for bringing
temporary labor into the country had expired, and it was not a
new legal theory, it was just a new category of workers who
took

advantage of what was already there, for their benefit,

already.
And I should address briefly also -QUESTION?

Kell, your view is that if the Court of

Appeals was right about the seasonal^, they were wrong about
the dailies?

54
MR» EVANS:

that’s right»

If they are correct

on one, I think they're wrong on the other»
I think the decision cannot be reconciled to the
two categories»
QUESTION:

You have to reject the idea of a third

category?
MR, EVANS:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
You say the third category belongs,

really, in the first.
MR. EVANS:

Yes. The daily ■— a daily commuter is a

daily commuter, whether he has a permanent job here or whether
he comes every day looking for a job, looking for work.
QUESTION: And in your view he’s a daily commuter
if he comes over to sell some merchandise for three days a
week in the United States, and three days a week in Canada?
MR, EVANS:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
A regular commuter might be a better name

for him, then.
MR. EVANS:

Well, I suppose if, you know, now that

the problem has been explored, through litigation, that the
regulations about which we have some reason to be embarrassed
might well be amended.

And the Service would like to amend

those regulations —
QUESTION:

And you wish to defer our decision

until you've had that opportunity?

55

MR. EVANS:

Well, I lirast say that it was at one

point considered whether

whether the regulations should be

amended to correct tine ambiguity.

But it was determined,

I think quite rightly, that it would be improper to make such
an amendment while the case is in litigation. And there has
been litigation over this issue ever since 1966, when the
case was instituted in the Ninth Circuit, Gooch v„ Clark.
There's never been a time when we've had a chance to
make any amendments without interfering with on-going litiga­
tion,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:56 p.ia., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.]
