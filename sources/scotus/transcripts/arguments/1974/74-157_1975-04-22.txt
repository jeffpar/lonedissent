MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear argument

and in No. 74-647, New York against Forman.
Mr. Rifkind.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON H. RIFKIND ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN No. 74-157
MR. RIFKIND;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is here by way of a petition for

certiorari which brought up for review the decision of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

That court has

reversed a judgment dismissing the complaint filed herein
for want of subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court
The respondents in this case, who were the
plaintiffs in the court below, are a number of residents of
a residential development called Co-op City located :Ln the
borough of the Bronx in the city of New York.

These

respondents purport to represent a class, to wit; all of
the owners of apartments in Co-op City, which is a giant
development and contains more than 15,000 homes.
The suit was generated by the sad circumstance to
which we have all been recently exposed, namely, that there
was an escalation in the costs of the maintenance of the
apartments which the respondents had acquired, and the
proffered basis for Federal jurisdiction was the allegation

4
•that the petitioners had violated-

the securities laws to

the respondents' detriment.
The complaint itself consisted, I believe, of 13
counts, of which 10 were State-related claims.
1933 Act violation.

One was a

The same facts were alleged as in 1934

violation, and then there was one claim against the State
and the State agency, I believe under the civil rights law.
And the central question which the case brings up
for review here is this:

Did the Congress in the securities

laws intend to reach the transaction which underlies this case?
And that transaction I shall, of course, describe.
We assert the negative of that question.

In other

words, that Congress had no such intention, and our argument
will rest on three pedestals, and I believe that each of them
would support the conclusion we are here to contend.
First, that this transaction related to homes, not
to securities and not to investments.
Secondly, that this is a transaction to which
commercial considerations and profit possibilities are
roughly alien, and therefore, not within the realm of
congressional concern at all.
And, lastly, we are dealing here with a Stata
created welfare plan in which the State selected and conferred
upon a group of its beneficiaries, a group of its citisens,
various benefits.

And as far as I can read the history of

congressional intention, I find that Congress has indicated
no interest in penetrating this field.
We start therefore in narrating our story with the
State of New York.

Acting through its legislature, the State

of New York became concerned with the plight of the city ■—
this was in the early sixties-:— the flight of the urban
middle class, the blight of the inner city slum, the decay
of the housing inventory in the big cities, the high cost
of replacement of dwellings making safe and clean dwellings
unattainable by wage earners and other people of lev/ or
modest income,

certainly an area of governmental concern

which I am sure this Court has heard of many times.

And the

State determined to make a massive contribution towards
alleviation of the conditions I have described.

the

Its

concern, the State's concern, was with homes and dwelling
places for its residents and citizens, not securitea and not
investment opportunities.
New Yor3: passed a law called the Mitchell-Lama law
which contained various provisions for a variety of
possibilities, but with respect to the subject that we are
concerned with, I will say that it created first a regulatory
agency which as applied to Co-op City has provided a system
of supervision and negotiation vastly more pervasive than any
system of regulation that we are familiar with, say, in the
utility field or the banking field or the airplane field or

6
any of the normal objects of regulation.

And I believe I

state correctly that my learned adversaries agree with me
that this was a very pervasive system of control.
course, there was a very good reason for it.

And, of

The State was

going to provide massive benefits to those who were going to
be the beneficiarias of this law.
It provided the mean3 for the obtaining of the
money necessary or the bulk of the money necessary for the
creation of this new housing which it contemplated.

The

State was offering to the prospective members of Co™op City
who it selected the following benefits, among otherss
First, savings realized from the availability of
construction and acquisition costs at very low cost because
the State agency could raise that money by tax-exempt
obligation of the agency.

I need hardly say that that represents

an enormous fraction of the cost of housing, the cost of the
money used in construction.
Then there were savings conferred upon the members
of this cooperative by the reduction or abatement of real
estate taxes to the extent of 80 percent thereof, again, a
very enormous benefit in the maintenance of these properties.
And then with the collaboration of e philantrophic
foundation called the United Housing Foundation, which I shall
describe .later, savings became possible in Co-op City by the
elimination of the promoter's profit, the entrepreneur's

7
profits the builder's profit, and the manager's profit„

All

of those were eliminated»
And then the cost overall was spread over a period
of 40 years, thus making the annual burden a very modest one
indeed, plus other benefits some of which I mentioned in my
brief but are relatively smaller in proportion»
It was all of these together that made it possible
to do what seems like a miracle today, to be able to sell
apartments at the price of $450 per room, a 4-roora apartment
for $1300.

Anyone who has purchased a cooperative apartment

knows that that is one of the miracles of the age.
Now, as I have said, Co-op City was. sponsored by
the United Housing Foundation.

This foundation is composed

of a group of labor unions, well known for their progressive
policies, like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers? the Inter­
national Ladies' Garment Workers Union, whose record of
performance in this area is well known; housing cooperatives>
civic workers, all volunteers, who furnished to this project
the sense of community involvement, who furnished the
enriching advice of knowledgeable, distinguished, and dedicated
citizens, and whose standing in the community was such that
they were able to add a little lubrication to the wheels of
the bureaucracy,

and perhaps more important than any of

these, to insure the generating idea, the idealism behind
this entire project, namely, the ideal of a community of

0

homaowning neighbors, democratically managed, nondiscriminatory
in style, endowed 'with the humane amenities in the artistic
and spiritual fields, a community of homes and a community of
homes.
Now, this was not the first experience of the United
Housing Foundation in this field.

It had a long record of

success in promoting and creating housing projects similarly
endowed with thi3 spiritual concept.

And in my brief 1 cite

quite a number of famous ones that are extant in the city of
New York.
And so it was that a city housing something like
50,000 people was built on what had previously been a playground
ih the northern part of the borough of the Bronx, and it took
a very considerable period to do it, from 1964 to 1972.

And

during that period I need hardly say that costs were climbing.
Every other index of our economy showed a similar climb in the
sense of inflationary costs.
Ultimately the project cost $422 million, considerably
in excess of the original estimates.

And of this $420 million,

the State agency furnished 92.26 percent.

And I want to

emphasise again that not only did the lav; specify the classes
of members who might live in this cooperative, namely, the
applicants had to show that their earnings were not in excess
of six times the estimated maintenance charges, but the very
individuals who were accepted for membership in this co-op had

9

to be approved by the State authorities, certainly not an
aspect which is normally found in the sale of investment
securities or speculations.
QUESTION:

What were the criteria for approval by the

State authorities in addition to the income levels of the
applicants?
MR. RIFKIND:

There were benefits conferred upon the

aged, upon veterans, upon the disabled and things of that kind.
Those were given preference.
QUESTION:

By regulation or statute?

MR. RIFKIND:

By the practices of the regulatory

agency and under its regulations.
Mow, I come to a central feature of this entire
transaction.

There was one concept that was excluded from

every phase of this enterprise, the concept of commercialism
and the corollary concept of profit.

This applied at all

stages of the transaction and not only to the one which is
most directly relevant to the question before this Court.
For instance, members of Co-op City could receive
no dividends.

Nov;, I know that my learned friend says that

they could under a section of the law.

Re misreads fchs law.

That section deals with rental properties by private builders,
but who have the right to have limited profit return, not to
Co-op City.
The court below said that there might be a rebate on

10

the rental if the cost of maintenance was less than was
estimated.

That is true since the cost of maintenance in a

cooperative is shared by all the members of the cooperative
and is based on an estimate.

If at the end it turned out that

the estimate was excessive, the excess is turned back to those
who had provided it.

I don't call that a dividend.

They could sell the homes that they had acquired *
but for no more than the coat at which they paid for them,
$450 a room.

Not a dollar more could they get for their homes,

no matter how much land values or building values may have
escalated in the city of New York.

And not only that, they

had to sell theix* homes if they moved from the premises.

It

was only a home for their personal residence and that of their
surviving spouse.

But if for any reason they wanted to move

out of Co-op City, they had to offer their apartments, their
homes, for sale to the corporation, to the co-op corporation
or to a qualified new buyer at the price at which they bought
it.
Not only were they not promised any profits» in the
literature which announced this project, they were told in
words loud and clear that there could not be any.
Now, I move up the scale away from the cooperatives
upward.

The United Housing Foundation, which was the sponsor

of the project, was formed under a statute in New York called
the Not-For-Profit Corporation law.

It could make no profit

II
because under the statute of its creation it was forbidden to
do so.

The construction was done by a wholly-owned subsidiary

of United Housing Foundation, and while that was organized as
an ordinary corporation, since its stockholders could make no
profit, namely, the United Housing Foundation, there would be
no point in the subsidiary earning any profit.
The subscribers were not offered tax deduction as an
inducement in the sense that tax shelters are marketed around
the street as this Court well knows where tax shelters are
offered as a form of investment.

That was not the approach

here, because there were no such possibilities except for the
modest tax deduction which is available to every homeowner on
the interest on his mortgage and on the taxes v/hich he contributes
to his community.
They were not offered any significant outside income,
that is, this was not a project where in addition to homes
there was a vast, shopping center attached to it from which the
people could hope to derive substantial speculative profits
because had that happened, the law would not have permitted
this project to be financed under the statute to which X have
referred.
All they were offered, and all that these people
received, was the opportunity to own a home, and that only so
long as they lived in it.

And if they had to part with it,

they could enjoy no form of capital appreciation.

12

Now, membership in this cooperative was memorialized
in two instruments, two writings:

One, an occupancy agreement,

so-called, but actually reads very much like an ordinary lease.
And, secondly, an instrument which was called

a share of stock*

but differing in many ways from the conventional one, especially
in the very fact that it could not be sold, could not be
hypothecated, couldn't be transferred, couldn't be given away,
and with which you had to part once you ceased being the
occupant of the apartment that you had bought.
Now, both the district court and the court of appeals
have vary meticulously expressed their avoidance of entertaining
any opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy
between the plaintiffs and defendants or between the petitioner?
and respondents.

I have observed that my good, learned friends have
extensively argued the merits of the case in their brief.
I shall not do so.

But

I shall rely on the proposition that the

only question before this Court is whether this controvery
belongs in a Federal forum under the securities laws or whether
it belongs in a State forum under laws adequate for that purpose
in the State of New York.
The district judge raade this comments

It is well to

note at the outset of this inquiry that it is the fundamental
nonprofit nature of this transaction which in this court's
view is the insurmountable barrier to plaintiff's claim in the

13
Federal court.

And we agree with that expression and hope

to win favor for it.
Our claim is a very narrow one,actually.

Our

central point is that Congress did not intend to bring within
the ambit of the securities law an enterprise devoted to the
purchase of homes, a State-dominated enterprise with
philanthropic and community participation to which the notion
of profit is utterly foreign, a project pursued without a
profit motive, promoted without profit inducement, and shared
by its beneficiaries without any expectation of gain.

And

the legislative history suggests to me that that is not what
Congress had in mind, because the evils against which these
securities laws were written are still sufficiently vivid
so that most of us can remember them from actual experience:
Predatory financial practices in the securities markets,
stock market price manipulation, luring of small investors by
false promises of easy wealth.

In short, I submit the realm

of congressional concern was to speculation and investment
realm, and its identifying flag was the promise or expectation
of profit, and one cannot read in my opinion the legislative
history of either the '33 or the ’34 het without coming to
that conclusion.
The district court read that history accurately
when it concluded that Congress did not intend to sweep into
the ambit of the Federal securities iav?s State-encouraged,

14
nonprofit transactions made pursuant to a State emergency
housing law —* all three elements that I have mentioned —
available only to State residents.
Now, in reaching a contrary conclusion, I believe
that the court of appeals was in error, and I should like to
identify its errors into three categories:
First, it was — I will finish this sentence — it
was moved by a literal application.

It misread this Court’s

illumination of the meaning of investment contract, and I
believe it misread the securities guidelines.
I will stop at this moment, and if I have some time
later, I will answer in rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. COHEN IN BEHALF
OR PETITIONERS IN No. 74-547
MR. COHEN:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Let me emphasise at the outset that we support

completely the position of the petitioners in No. 157, that
the Congress did not contemplate including within the purview
of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts shares in the membership
of a publicly aided cooperative housing corporation whose
primary objective was the furnishing of housing accommodations
to persons of limited income who were prohibited under the

15
general terms of the statute authorizing the construction of
Mitchel1-Lama housing from selling those 3hares for a profit
or for the expectation of a profit.
I shall confine my argument, however, to the point
upon which the State and the State housing Finance Agency
obtained certiorari, that neither the State nor the State's
Housing Finance Agency are subject to suit in the Federal
courts for the relief demanded in this complaint.
How, just as a matter of fact, there had been
references in Judge Rifkind's argument to supervision by the
State.

Supervision by the State has been through the

State Commissioner of Housing.

The State Commissioner of

Housing has been the agency of the State that supervised the
construction and supervises the management of this project.
The State Financing Agency is an agency which has supplied the
money to the extent of the 92 percent that was necessary by
the sale of bonds to the public.

It is a different agency.

As to the State itself, we submit that its claim of
immunity and the same claim would be applicable to the State
Commissioner of Housing, if that State agent had been made
a party defendant to this litigation,and the State Commissioner
of Housing has never been sued or named as a defendant in this
litigation, we submit, that tills claim of immunity from suit
is sustainable and should have been sustained under this
Court's decisions in Edelman v. Jordan and Employees v.

Rifkind's arguments, would ws get to your point?
MR. COHEN:

I don't think you need to.

what the court did in the district court.

You can do

It did not reach

our argument because it was not necessary to do so.
QUESTION?

And really, if Judge Rifkind is correct,

there is no Federal jurisdiction.
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And there being no Federal jurisdiction,

the 11th Amendment argument falls out of the case because,
after all, the 11th Amendment is a jurisdictional statute, is
it not?
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:
MR. COHENs

Yes, your Honor.
Having to do with Federal courts.
Yes, your Honor.

We have a back-up argument so far as the Stats is
concerned, but if you are persuaded by Judge Rifkind’s argumentr
you need not reach our portion of the case at all.
QUESTION:

One part of, one count of the complaint,

though, was posited not on Securities Act jurisdiction but
on section 1343, warm'fc it, which was derived from 1983?
MR. COHEN.

One cause of action directed against the

State Housing Finai:3e Agency is so posited.

But the difficulty

with that particular complaint is that it is directed against

17
an agency which is purely a financing agency, an agency which
has supplied the money with which this particular project was
built.

And so far as I can imagine, I don't see how any sort

of reasonable construction could lead to a cause of action
against an agency — and this is something that goes to the
merits» because it goes to the heart of the case as against
this agency, no possible cause of action, it seems to me, could
be reasonably predicated against the State agency which
furnished the money which made this project feasible.

These

plaintiffs would, have no place to live in if this money had
not been furnished despite the increases in costs that occurred
that compelled the furnishing of more money by the State
Housing Finance Agency than had bean contemplated or expected
in the first instance.
That applies only to this single cause of action
against the Agency.
•Sow, the opinion by Judge Rehnquist in the Edelman
case came down on a period that was just shortly after the
briefs had been submitted in this case by counsel before the
Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Edelman opinion was not noticed

at all in the opinion by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and
we feel that so far as the State itself is concerned, so far
as the State supervising agency is concerned, the Commissioner
of Housing, there would be no basis for assuming that there
had bean either any waiver of immunity or any consent by the

13
action of the State in sponsoring this project.

Housing was

a field in ’which the State of New York was intensely Interested
long before the Securities and Exchange Act was passed.
Actually, one of the limited dividend projects that is
connected in some way with this same sponsoring agency,
Amalgamated Houses,was set up in 1928.

People actually were

living in Amalgamated Houses in 1927, Christmas of 1927.
There is not here the factor which was present in
the Pardon case of the State going into a proprietary enterprise.
The State was here simply as a regulator.
own.

The State did not

These people did not contemplate that they were going

into a project that was State owned or that might be deemed
to be State owned.
QUESTION;

It was more than a regulator? it was a

great financial backer as well, was it not?
MR. COHENs

It was a financial backer, and it derived

no financial benefit from its financial backing.

It did not

provide any money except to people who had limited income
by Wav of various types of subsidies, and it had no proprietary
interest in those subsidies.

It furnished housing, it furnished

the benefit in the nature of a welfare benefit.
QUESTION?
MR. COHENs
QUESTION?
MR. COHEM:

No monetary profit.
No monetary profit.
Just social profit.
Social profit, yes, your Honor.

19
Now,, we have, I think, no need to make any extended
argument as to the State’s immunity, as your Honor'has indicated,
it’s not necessary to reach that portion of the case if you
agree with Judge Rifkind’s argument.

And I think I can saw

the time of the Court by resting here and asking that the
judgment of the court o£ appeals be reversed and that, the
complaint in this action be dismissed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Cohen,

Mr. Nizer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS NIZER OH BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NIZER:
the Court:
whether

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The sole securities issue on this appeal is

1,312,128 shares of cosmon stock publicly offered

by wide distribution through the mails to 15,372 separate
purchasers for more than 132,800,000 in cash paid by these
purchasers constitutes securities under':' the Federal laws.
Of the thousands of decisions involving alleged
frauds in the sale of stock which had been rendered by the
Federal courts during the past. 40 years, there is not a
single case which supports the defendants’ contention that
common stock does not come under the protection of the anti-*
fraud provisions of the securities laws.
The reason that the defendants cannot cite a single
case in which common, stock was held not to be a security is

20

that this court as far back as 1943 settled this issue in the
Joiner case.

It mandated that the specific term "stock” as a

matter of law is ah security.

And it also held that where.- as

here; the case involved "a share of stock; the plaintiff need
only offer” the document itself to prove that it is a security
and thereby establish jurisdiction under the Federal secutities
act.
Now, the defendants concede here that the common
stock is so designated, par value $25 a share.
at the UH brief, page 11.

That appears

But they urge that these shares

denominated as common stock are something different than what
they are represented to be, and even this in the Joiner case
this Court disposed of such convoluted reasoning.

This Court

held that in the enforcement of the securities laws offerings
"will be judged as being what they were represented to be."
QUESTION:

Mr. Niaer, in Toherepnin didn't the

Court — which is a later case than Joiner — the Court does
talk about looking at substance rather than form, doesn't it?
MR. NI2ER:

Sura,

lbid I will discuss that in full,

your Honor, in a moment, but there they were talking of an
investment, contract.

That's the second string to our bow.

When it is stock you don't hava to go to the question of whether
it constitutes an investment contract without being stock.
QUESTION:

The language I am thinking of is this

language on page 336 where they 3ay, "Finally, we are reminded

21
that in searching for the meaning and scope of the word
'security' in the Act, form should lx* disregarded for substance
and the Act's emphasis should be on economic reality."

They

were talking about the full definition of the security.
MR. NIZER:

Yes, and I think the economic realitios

here, as I shall soon develop, clearly indicate that this is
a stock transaction on its face and in the economic realities.
I do not agree with the learned counsel that this is distinguished
from other cases.

Interpreting a State law.

That's right.

But I think since I have limited time, I would like

22

to come to the economic realities here.

I think that will be

better addressed to your Honor■s question,
The court belov; has been chastised by the defendants
for being literal because it followed the instruction of this
Court in the Joiner case, and the statute fortunately is
explicit and lucid.
Stock is a security.

And in this admirable sense it is literal.
And so it is.

To cavel with such

legislative clarity is unwittingly or otherwise to distort the
statute's true meaning in order to avoid its clear application
to this case.
Now, 24 years later this Court reexamined and
reaffirmed the Joiner case, and that was of course in the
Tcharepnin case that your Honor referred to, which provides
a rafte instance of a case remarkably similar in fact to our
case and in which the Court rejected the same contention as
the defendants make here.

In Tcherepnin the plaintiffs bought

shares in a savings and loan association and the defendants
there contended that the shares purchased were not stock because,
looking at the realities, one, they were not publicly traded,
as here, they didn't fluctuate in value, they were redeemable
at par only, the shares represented memberships rather than
an investment

I notice this constant use of the word "member­

ship" here. — that the shares lacked many customary attributes,
such as preemptive rights, right to inspect the books, although
we have that right in our case.

And there were restrictions

23
on assignability.

Those all the same issues.

And these

arguments were held by this unanimous Court to be irrelevant
to the question of whether Federal security laws were applicable.
And this Court held that the shares in that case were
includable in the statute as stock because there was a stock
certificate and,as the Court pointed out there, also the
possibility of surplus, which is of course the dividends,
even though, mind you, in that case, as your Honors will
recall, it was brought in the receivership, the defendant
was Knight, the receiver.

Yet they talked of the potential

of surplus,which is sufficient, the very possibility of it.
Wow, clearly in our case these elements escisfc.
Above all, this Court in Tche repaint pronounced the policy
consideration and philosophy of these statutes which provide
special insight, we submit, and a large viev7 of the present
case,

There the Court pointed out that the purpose of the

statute was .to protect particularly the many small investors.
1 think there was a quotation that they repeated from Joiner,

remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate
its purpose, tha reach of the Act does not stop with the obvious
commonplace.
In our case, the plaintiffs were eligible to buy
the stock which would give them a four-room apartment with
a monthly carrying charge of $23.02 as represented in the
prospectus.

If they earned more than $6,600, they weren’t

The jurisdictional facts demonstrating that this

spelled out in the complaint.

agreement."

And that's at 178-A of the record.

Now* the subscription agreement* which was attached

I may say now in answer to a contention made here,
all of the money, all of the $432 million instead of $289
million as was represented in the prospectus upon 'which these
poor people put up their savings, all of that money had to be
provided by tha public®

The only thing the State did

this

is not like the subsidised housing at all — all that the
State gave was the advantage of a low-interest mortgage,
valuable indeed, which had to be paid off in full with
interest in the 40 years, and all that the State did otherwise
was the city gave a tax rebate, which is done for other
housing projects, even commercial projects.

But 100 percent

of the money to construct this enormous structure for 60,000
people had to be paid by this 60,000 people, and they weren’t
eligible even to ovm the stock unless they earned only $6,600
a year.
And the plain practical situation, when my friend
talks of profits and all these general commercial propositions,
the plain practice that through fraudulent representations
which appear in allegations of the complaint —* 2 am not
discussing the merits; I am showing that there is a proper
complaint here under the statute ~ in their representations
they said that the cost above $289 million to construct this
would be borne by the contractor, which is the C.S.X., and
he would take any excess.

That was tha basis on which these

26

people put. up their money,

/hid yet when inflation came and

the costs went up, by fraudulent ignoring of the direct
representation that the contractor would bear that cost if
there was an inflation, not maintenance increase, that we have
to pay, that kind of inflation, or operation, but construction.
They increased it $30 million one year, $40 million another
year, and loaded it onto these people who had taken it on the
representation that not one cent of that money would be paid
by them? it would be paid by the contractor.
this possible?

And why was

Because the contractor, the C.S.I. and the U.H.P.,

this fine organisation — .incidentally, we have not joined
as defendants the heads of these unions and so on, they were
figureheads? we sued the operating company.

They had inter­

locking directors, precisely the same directors and officers
as the contractor was in the

and even of Riverbay

'

Company, the company whose stock these people bought had the
same directors and officers.

So that this was an interlocking

situation in which even the State Commissioner waived a
requirement of bonds for the construction of this property,
and he waived the liquidity requirement, a liquidity requirement
in the contract which said that the contractor must have
$13 million liquidity, and he waives that, and the contractor
Ms $100,000 liquidity.
So that it saems to us that not only have wa a clear
stock transaction sold in the market to these people, but that

27

all the elements of a fraud action exist here under the
statutes? and it was intended that the people who build that
kind of structure should not be immune any more than the man
who invests for large profits?as they call it? collectio
profits in Wall Street.

I don't see why this statute? which

is remedial?should be limited to the large investor? legitimate
though he be.

Why should it not apply to these people who

put up their life's earnings and probably made the only
investment they ever made in stock in their lives?
The Riverbay Company? our company? was? as the
complaint says? the captive of the contractor and the sponsor?
and $81 million was loaded onto the Riverbay stockholders
improperly.

And there is a claim? since I will not have a

chance to rebut again? that there was notice of this.
deny the notice.

We

The notice didn’t even refer to all these

increases; it saysthere will be an increase.

But? as your

Honors know? you cannot waive under the Securities Act the
provisions and protections of the Act.

Evan if they had

given us notice? it would be ineffectual.
Now? what is sufficient for affirmance? that in
this case we have this widely distributed shares of par value
common stock bought for tens of millions of dollars and
represented to be stock in a prospectus and a subscription
agreement. Clearly this alone warrants application of the
Federal securities law and jurisdiction in the Federal courts.

28

Thera are two additional grounds for affirmance.
The shares are also an investment contract.
such clearly.

They qualify as

And that they are an instrument commonly known

as security, another definition of the Securities Act.
In view of the argument to be made by counsel for the
SBC and the time elements, I shall leave these two alternative
grounds to our brief at pages 48 to 60.

And I turn to the

11th Amendment question because I think I would like to deal
with that.
With respect to the 11th Amendment issue, only the
State of New York is involved.

The Agency is not involved

and clearly may be sued in the Federal court for two reasons;
It is a separate legal entity, and it is not a division or
department of the State of New York.
QUESTION;

May it be sued under 1983 as well as under

the Securities lax* in view of cases like Monroe v. Papa
and Bruno v. Kenosha?
MR. NIZER;
QUESTION s
MR. NIZER;

Yes, I think it can be.
Why?
An agency is a person, and under the

interpretation that this Court has given to the Securities
Act, a definition of person includes a State governmental
agency of any kind.
QUESTION;

I would have thought a 1983 cause of

action would have turned on the definition of person in 1983

29
rather than in the Securities Act»
MR. NIZER:

Well, it’s a person under the Civil

Rights Act, as I suppose the other aspect of the question.
But under the Securities Act we also have a definition which
defines person as any State,which is to me one of the reasons
why there is authority to sue here and the waiver does take
effect.
The fact that there is a separate legal entity in
the agency is conceded by the Attorney General of the State of
New York in his opinion No. 56, which we have cited.
But second, and determinativeP is the fact that
any judgment against the agency is not enforceable against the
State.

They are two separate entities and there is no link

of liability by statute or otherwise for each other's
obligation.

Indeed, your Honors, there is a specific disciaim©

of liability in section 46 of division 8 of the Private Housing
Finance law.

And the bonds of the agency are not the debt

of the State.
Therefore, like any other corporation, the agency
is subject to Federal jurisdiction.
Now, with respect to the State, it has waived its
immunity in two ways:

First, by special s .atuce quoted at

page 67 of our brief, the white document.

It's section

32(5) of the Private Housing Finance lav/.

And,, secondly

by its conduct in this very case.

30
Nawi first, as to the statute.

You have been told

that -the statute waives immunity only in i a
State court-

suit in the

There is nothing in the language of the statute

which would justify any such limitation, however strict the
construction.

On the contrary, the statute reads that the

State "may be sued in the same manner as a private person."
Surely a private person can be sued in a Federal court.
Indeed, a private person cannot be sued in the State court of
claims.
Furthermore, there is a conclusive indicator in the
language of the waiver that it;was not intended to limit
jurisdiction in the State court.
scope of the v?aiver.

It reads?

That language refers to the
"With regard to liabilities

arising out of the Mitchsl1-Lama Act, the State nay be sued
in the same manner as a private person."
Now, what term could be more generic and mors
conclusive than the word "liabilities"?

Case law, which we

set forth on page GO of our brief, demonstrates that the
unqualified use of the word "liability" encompasses Federal
as well as State claims.

And the supervisory duties Of the

State through the Commissioner with respect to cooperative
housing are all pervasive.

The Commissioner is charged with

responsibility to see that Riverbay complies with "the law.41
That's section 32(1).

So Riverbay stock sold in violation of

the anti-fraud provisions of the security law certainly brings

31
into definition what do we mean by compliance with law?

And

that has been interpreted even by the New York courts as the
laws of the land.
The second sentence of the waiver which prohibits the
recovery of costs has been raised in the brief though not
argued orally, prohibits recovery of costs against the State
does not alter the right to sue in the Federal court.

It merely

means the plaintiff cannot recover costs because he has
accepted the condition of the waiver.
Now, in its reply brief, the Stats cites five cases,
all dealing with refunds of State taxes, and these cases are
not applicable to our case because there the statute sat
forth a comprehensive scheme involving procedures before
State administrative agencies, the final step of which was
judicial review of the State agency's determination in the
State court.

Furthermore, all that was involved there in

these five cases were State tax law, not as here, federally
created right.

I stress the fact that this is not a case of

diversity of citizenship.

We belong here under the right of

the statute.
In addition to statutory waiver, there is the State’s
conduct.

This Court set forth a test composed of two elements

to determine when the State's conduct constitutes a waiver,
the Edelman case.

And incidentally that was argued in the

court of appeals.

It caste down late, but it was argued there,

32
briefs — we admit that State’s regulation does not subject
it to the Federal jurisdiction»

Here we have the State

participating pervasively in every fact.

Indeed? under the

Mitcha11-Lama Act? not a shovel of earth could have been
turned until public put up this §32 million»

In other words?

the State from the beginning to the end? not only supervises?
there is no regulation merely? it organised the entire
construction in every way.
Also? the State of New York in 1955 passed the
Mitchell-Lama Act? and this was 20 years after the Securities
Act? so that the State with full knowledge that it was in the
realm of Federal regulation went ahead? and the Mitchell-Lama
Act itself represents a decision by the State to furnish
housing by obtaining venture or risk capital from the public
through sale of co-op stock.
To be brief? and in conclusion? since my time is
running out, the State, under the statute is the major partici­
pant in planning the project? raising the venture capital
from the public? construction? and operation.

The project?

no other State has a statute of waiver of immunity similar to

So wa are dealing here with an exceedingly

restricted area, but the rights of these plaintiffs ought to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL GONSON ON BEHALF
OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GONSON:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

In this case we have, as has been noted, 15,000

persons who have paid over $32 million to purchase over
1 million shares of stock in a cooperative housing corporation.
The funds, the $32 million, were utilised by the corporation
in the construction of that apartment project.
The Securities and Exchange Commission submits that
their allegations of fraud, which are based upon documents
that were given to them in connection with that project, should

34
be heard under the Federal securities laws»
Now, these persons executed essentially two documents,
as I understand.

One was a subscription agreement to buy stock.»

The other was an occupancy agreement, which was in effect a
lease.

MR. GQNSON:

That is correct, your Honor.

But it's

And in this case we

wish to emphasize that one of them talks about stock, and that
is very important.

And while it has been noted that, of course,

substance should prevail over form, the fact that stock is
involved here is not merely a question of form, as perhaps
was implicit in that suggestion.

On the other hand, I think

that it is fair to say that the fact that there is stock itself
connotes substance.

What dividends?

Will you amplify on

36

MR. GGNSQNs

Well, the Mitchell~Lama Act provides

that limited profit housing corporations may issue dividends,
QUESTION:

Does this corporation come under that

provision of that Act?
MR. GONSON;
that it does.

It is my understanding, your Honor,

The record at 167-A, 188-A describes this as

a limited profit housing corporation,
QUESTION:

Did either one of the courts below

recognise the possibility of dividends under that section?
MR. GONSCNs

Yes, your Honor, the court of appeals

recognised that possibility.

We refer to that in our brief

at page 15.
QUESTION:
MR. GONSONs

Where is it in the court of appeals' opinion?
I believe it*3 on page 16 of the

appendix, your Honor, or thereabouts.

I have been handed the bylaws of the corporation,
your Honor, which also indicate that there is a possibility
of dividends, Article V, which is found at 130-A of the
record.

This is the record of the court of appeals.
QUESTION2

The court of appeals, as I read the

opinion, stated that there were expectations of income in
three ways, and none of the three involved the possibility of
any dividends.
MR. GONSONs

Yes, the court of appeals, I believe,

spoke of surplus income, your Honor, and I believe that one

37

possibility of their surplus income as provided in the

Mitchell-Lama Act is the payment of dividends.
QUESTIO!?:

Do you understand that those dividends

would be paid in cash' on these shares?
MR. GONSONs

I believe that they could be paid

under the New York law in cash, but I believe they probably
would be paid in the form of reduction of rentals if there is
a surplus from operations.
QUESTION;
t- i

If the rentals ware reduced in that way,

But we were talking about dividends and

Would you advise any one of the plaintiffs in this

case to pay income taxes on the type of benefit you are
talking about?
MR. GONSGNs

Possibly not, your Honor»

X am not

sufficiently familiar with the consequence of the application
of the income tax laws to the situation to answer that
question fully.

It may very well be the kind of return that

I suppose essential y

it is not income, although it could very wall be in the nature

of a dividend,
QUESTION s

Did I understand you to say that the

only prospect of dividend is if the operating costs go down?
MR. GONSONs
QUESTION!

I believe ~
Because if that's true? I doubt that

anybody assumes that as of today that operating costs will go
down.
MR. GON8QN;

Well? your Honor, it would come from

a combination of what is collected as against \*hat it costs
to run the project.

The surplus? as distinguished from

dividends? also may come from the rentals which are obtained
from commercial properties which I understand in the aggregate
came to more than $4 million in this project.
QUESTION s

They go to the Riverbay, or whatever it

is, toward operations?
MR. GOMSONi

Yes? they do, your Honor,

they are used in effect to offset the monthly carrying
charges that these persons have to pay.
In addition, in terms of what attributes were
there? the stock also entitled the holder to a right to
participate in assets upon liquidation or dissolution,

this Court has said? that stock have all of the attributes

Nonetheless, they may all still be understood to be stock.
QUESTION?

argument, if some different pieces of paper were issued that
weren't called stock but had the attributes that these pieces
of paper have —

contract, are you?
MR. GONSON;

Yes, but I would like to emphasize

once again, your Honor, if I may, that the issue here is not
whether an interest which on its face does not purport to be
a security is nevertheless to be a security,rather it is
the contrary, it is the issue of whether something which
purports to be a security, a stock, should nonetheless be
heId not to be a security.
QUESTION;

Mr. Gonson, you are not taking the

40
position, are you, that any piece of paper that is called a
share of stock is necessarily per se a share under the
Securities Act, are you?
MR. GONSON:

Mo, sir.

We are not taking the

position that if you received a certificate that said, "In
consideration of the contribution to the Boy’s Club, you have
a share of stock in the youth of America," that that would be
a share of stock.

But if you receive or subscribe to stock

which you know is going to be an undivided interest in a
corporation and which is going to carry certain benefits,
then we say there is a very strong presumption

at the outset

that what you have received is in fact a security.
QUESTION s

But in the end you look to the economic

MR. GONSONs

Yes.

look to the economic reality.

I think in the end you would
And as this Court said in the

Tcherepnln case, in searching for the meaning and scope of
the word '’security” the emphasis should be on economic
reality.

And in this case the basic economic reality of the

transaction here is the coming together of a number of factors,
significant economic inducements are given to persons, they
make an investment at the outset ~
QUESTION: Isn’t it an economic reality that you
can’t get the lease without the stock?
MR. GQNSON:

The economic reality,

your Honor, is

41
that the stock is a passkey to the apartment.
Court

But as this

noted in the United Benefit case, it may be very

possible to have both a security and an insurance contract in
the same document.

And there this Court reversed the court ox

appeals which had looked at the transaction as a whole# found
that it was substantially insurance and concluded that it was
an insurance contract and not subject to the Federal securities
laws.

And this Court reversed it# said theit the error had

beer, that it was severable# even though it was one document#
part of it was a security subject to the securities laws; the
other part of it was insurance properly subject to State
insurance regulatory laws.
And so here# too# you have housing.

We are not

contending that housing is subject to the securities laws
whatsoever.

But in order to obtain the housing one must buy

stock# a security, which has certain attributes.

We think

that that stock separately ought to be subject to the Federal
securities laws.
Finally, I would note that the dark forebodings
of the future which have been uttered here as to what would
happen to the real estate industry if the securities law were
to apply is not Well taken.

We are not urging that all multiple

housing firms be subjected to securities regulation.

On the

contrary# we believe that our position here is a modest one.
We are not asking this Court to enlarge the coverage of the

42
securities laws»
it»

We are asking that this Court not diminish

Thousands of persons have

bought stock on the basis of

economic inducements and,simply put, we believe that they are
entitled to the protections of those laws that apply to stock.
Thank you.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Gonson, in the section of your brief

that argues that this type of housing would not be seriously
interfered with if required to comply with the Securities Act,
the first suggestion your brief makes is that section 3(a)(11),
the provision for intrastate offerings, would be available.
Do you suggest seriously that an offering of 15,000 people
could be accomplished under 3(a)(11)?
MR. GONSGNs

Your Honor, in this very case the

subscription agreement stated that it was offered only to
residents of the State of New York.
QUESTIONs

Correct.

But suppose there had been a

single offeree who was not a resident of New York, what would
have been the consequences?
MR. GQNSONs

There would have been, of course, some

danger that the exemption might not have been available, but
the statute requires, as I understand it, your Honor, that
the residents be actually residents of the State of New York,
tod I suppose when we talk about State-supported housing,
that such housing is going to be constructed essentially, if
not exclusively,

for the State's own residents,

tod so when

43

v?© offer the possibility in our brief that the registration
requirements of the Securities Act might not. be applicable,
I think that it is a reasonable suggestion to make.
QUESTION?

The difference between the people who

buy and the people to whom a security is offered and the
3(a)(11) exemption relates to offerees as well as to buyers.
And if you make one mistake in an offer to a person outside
of the State, your Commission will require a rescission offer.
MR. GQNSQN:

That is correct, your Honor,

That

exemption, like other exemptions, are strictly construed.
We offer that as one of a number of possibilities to indicate
that there may be ways available to not have to comply with
registration or prospectus requirements of the Act.
QUESTION:

I am not sure what, if any, significance

there was or is about the residency requirement, but under the
Shapiro case, wouldn't any person who had come to New York
and been there one day been eligible to get into this
enterprise?
MR. GONSGNs

I would assume so if the residence were a

bona fide one, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, if they could collect welfare, then

they could get into this enterprise.
MR. GOKSON:
QUESTION:

I would assume so.
Frequently, the determination of whether

or not that exemption is available will turn on the trial of

44
the issue of fact of the residence
MR. GOHSONs

of a particular offeree.

1 suppose that’s correct, your Honor,

but I think that that probably is so with respect to the
utilization of almost any exemption.
QUESTIONS

That's why hardly anybody uses that

intrastate offering, because if you make one mistake, you're
through.
MS. GOMSONi

That’s correct, your Honor.

We refer,

however, to other possible exemptions that may be available.
And may I note that even if no exemption were available, we
are net talking about an especially onerous burden.
not talking about guarantees of any kind,

We are

We are merely

saying that then what would be required is that information
would have to toe filed and a prospectus would have to be given
to prospective purchasers.

And a project of this massive

size, we submit that that would not appear to be on its face
an insurmountable obstacle.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Rifkind, -

Very well.

you have about 10 minutes remaining,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON H. RIFKIND
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN No. 74-157
MR. RIFKINDI

Thank you.

May it please the Court, my learned friend, Mr,
Wiser, opened by an impressive set of figures vihich were

45
designed, I think, to impress with their sise.

He spoke of the

large number of shares, the large number of residents, and the
large amount of money.
But I take it that questions of jurisdiction are not
measured by that kind of a yardstick, and the same principles
would be applied if this was a 2O-roora house in Clean, New
York, and was financed by a very much smaller transaction.
So I think we can disregard this jury appeal and address
ourselves to the question as to whether we are talking about
a security.
Of course, my learned friend keeps on saying that
they bought stock, and I kept on saying that they bought homes.
And the» economic reality which tine case which Mr. Justice
Rehnquist referred to compels us to listen to is what was
the business transaction that this home buyer was interested
in.
He said, of course, it9s called a share of stock.
Well, Mr. Justice Stewart referred to livestock is also stock
and not all trees are trees, some are whiffletrees and some
are hat trees.

The mer® fact that you hang your label on it

of stock, because this is the conventional mechanism by which
the general public is approached this way, doesn’t necessarily
lead to the conclusion that it is stock.

1 am not suggesting

for a minute that when you call something stack yon shouldn't
examine whether it isn’t stock.

Of course, you start out by

46
saying he called it stock,, maybe it. is.
doesn't say every stock is a security.

But the statute
The statute says

every stock is a security unless the content otherwise directs.
And the context takes us back to the purposes of the statute,
to the legislative object.

And the legislative object lander

the Securities laws was to control the market place in
securities, the market place in investments, the market place
in speculations in that kind of money-making enterprises„ and
not in a social welfare scheme of the kind we are talking about
here.
Mr. Miser referred to the cash contribution of
7 percent which 'the subscribers here furnished.

Well, it is

in the aggregate a very large amount of money, but the
comparison that I would make would be more to the fact that
a Medicare participant, an age group to which I now belong,
pays a small percentage of his medical bill when he goes to
the hospital.

That doesn’t mean that it is not a social

welfare program that, we are talking about.
On the question of rescindability which was mentioned,
I should say that every contract here was rescindable.

Thousands of them were rescinded.

And even the plaintiff

below, Mr. Milton Forman, rescinded their contract recently
when they moved out of the apartment and got their money back.
On one question I must take issue with my learned
friend, and that is on the definition of person as given in

47
the Securities Act.
as a person.

The 1934 Act does not define the State

The 1934 Act,, as I read it, says the term "person"

means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an
association, a joint stock company, a business trust, or an
unincorporated organisation.

So it can't be the *34 Act in

which the fraud statute appears.

It’s the '33 Act which

deals with registration which includes a government or
political subdivision thereof.

But nobody claims that we

should have registered in this case.

We didn't, of course, and

nobody claims we should have.
QUESTION:

It’s' the. "33 Act, too, that expressly confers

the right of a purchaser to sue, isn’t it?
MR. RIFKIND s

That may well be.

Now, on the question of dividends, no cooperi.tive
pays dividends.

Essentially a cooperative is ten couples going

to the theater together and contributing $23 apiece?if when
they return from the theater there is $10 left in the kitty
they pay it back to the subscribers.

That doesn’t mean that

that theater party declared a dividend in a business venture
for which the people invested their $25.
QUESTION:

The dividend in the same sense that a

dividend on a life insurance policy might be called a dividend,
isn’t it?
MR. RIFKIND:

Even that might be more of a dividend

than the actuality, because there it derives from the earnings

48
of the insurance company.
QUESTION?

If the costs turn out to be lower than *—

MR. R2FKT.NDs

If the costs turn out to be less.

Now? this court of appeals must have been troubled
by this very question.

If it weren't troubled by the

question as to whether this was really security, they wouldn't
have reached out for what I most respectfully say the trivia
which they identified as the profit features of this
transaction.
Just look at them.

They said that there was

reduced carrying charges resulting from the rentals received
out of commercial spaces.

Now, I think this Court ought to

know what we are talking about,

In this community of 15,000

homes and 15,000 people there had to bs some grocers.
Incidentally, this is quite remote from the center
of town.

There had to be some butchers.

some barbers.

There had to be

There had to fee some people who are rendering

that kind of normal neighborhood service.

And naturally you

have to make space available for them and some income was
generated that way.
investment?

Does that make this a shopping center

It's to me comparable

if the management of this

cooperative had said we are going to charge every householder
for his bathwater, that would generate some money, but that
doesn't make the housing cooperative a business venture in the
sense of earning dividends.

49
The second tiling they said was that these homeowners
enjoy tax deductibility for their share of the interest and
the mortgage and their share of the taxes that they paid to
the city.

And, of course, that is true? as this Coart well

knows, every homeowner is entitled to that deduction.
Every owner of a cooperative apartment is entitled to that
deduction.

Every owner of a condominium apartment is entitled

to that deduction.

It has nothing to do with the securities

business at all, it has nothing to do with the investment
aspect of this thing at all, it is an aspect of homeownership,
not of security ownership.

Moreover, it doesn't depend upon

the efforts of others, it depends upon the taxpayer's personal
status.

If he has no reportable income, this tax deduction

doesn't do him any good.

It’s only if he has some income

against which he can take this deduction that he confers any
benefit upon it.
And the third item, that really was reaching.
said, well, this is a bargain.
to live.

They

It's going to cost them less

That's the benefit that the State conferred upon him.

That's like saying that Medicare is a profitable enterprise.
This just doesn't add up, to my way of thinking of it.

Of

course, there were — cooperativo ownership means that the
people who run the property don't make a profit.

So you

don’t have to pay the profit to the man who runs it.
also imposes some obligations.

It

It means you have got to see

30
that the snow is shoveled; and so on.

But to call tills bargain

a profit aspect of tills enterprise goes beyond what 1 think
is rational elucidation of the statute.
Mow, as far as the SSC is concerned, I can say very
little.

Their brief was only delivered to me within — the

final brief I didn’t get until yesterday, 1 think.

And we

have put in a typewritten answer which we will furnish a
printed brief on.

I am baffled by the position of the SSC?

because until recently they certainly wanted to keep hands
off the sale of cooperatives and the sale of condominiums
and all this business and they wrote rules which excluded
them and wrote no-action letters which excluded them, and
wrote guidelines in the release which is in the record in
which all the identifying marks that are attributed to this
project, exclude them from the field of security regulation.
QUESTION:
Maybe.

Maybe.

Well, they just changed their mind, Judge.

Maybe.

MR. RIFKIND:

If they have changed their mind, all

1 can say is they appeared on the scene very, very lat®.
Indeed, they were not in the district court, they were not.
in the court of appeals, and didn’t get here until a couple
of days ago.
I think I have taken all the time I should.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

51
Thank you, gentlemen.
