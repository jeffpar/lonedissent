PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 7^-22, Ivan Allen Company against the United
States.
Mr. McAlpin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK McALPIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MC ALPIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case before you today is in behalf of the
Taxpayer, Ivan Allen Company.
This is a penalty tax case.

It is referred to also

as an accumulated earnings tax ease.

It arises under Section 531a 537 Internal Revenue
Code.
If the Court would permit, I might, in one very
brief moment, spell out the particular provision of 533
which is of issue in this case.

The very section of 533

portion which is particularly pertinent to the

consideration

says this:
"The fact that the earnings and profits of a
corporation are permitted to accumulate beyond the
reasonable needs of the business shall be determinative of
the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to share­
holders .

4
I might stats briefly that Ivan Allen Company is
involved in this case by reason of the purchase of Xerox
stock in 19 — for the years 1965, 1966.
The Issue here Is whether or not Ivan Allen Company
accumulated earnings beyond the reasonable needs of the
business.

Do we —- did our earnings and profits exceed our

reasonable business needs for those years?
The issue has been framed by stipulation to present
a relatively simple Issue Insofar as the business figures of
the corporation are concerned.
The amount of Xerox stock which we claim and

did

so claim successfully in the District Court, which was
purchased from earnings

accumulated earnings — was

$154,000.
That is the amount of investment which vie have in
liquid assets.
as

That amount was reflected in the year 1965

$154,000.
In the year 1966, a taxable year, and'on June the

30th, that was reflected a.s $135,000 because some of that
Xerox stock had been sold In the year 1965.
The question here before this Court is whether or
not the earnings and profits in determining this question, of
whether the earnings and profits exceed the original needs of
the business are reasonable needs to be compared with the
earnings and profits reflected In the

liquid assets, as we

contend, at cost or, as the Government says, as total
resources available including unrealized appreciation, as
the Government contends.
The Xerox stock went from basic cost of $154,000
in the year — for the taxable year 1965 -- to

$1,640,000,

rough figures.
In the year 1966, as the records will show, that
same stock — at that time $135,000 — had a net liquidation
market value less costs of — well, the market value at that
time, of $2,500,000.
QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin, why does an office supply

company buy stock like Xerox?
MR. MC ALPIN:

All right, sir, the reason was, they

were — I don’t know if it is in the record — they were
in the 3-M.

They had the

franchise for 3-M machine, the

old machine that was Minnesota Mining.
They lost that franchise.
the market.

They saw that Xerox on

They were aware and they saw that —- Mr. Allen,

back in the 60’s, he had some cash money, your Honor, and
this was accumulated earnings which the record will show was
needed in the

operating capital.

It is stipulated that this

cash, we agree is operating capital.
He invested this in a security rather than leaving
it idly in the cash or just In a savings account,
QUESTION:

You say Mr. Allen had some money.

You

6
mean —
MR. MC ALPIN:

No, no, I am saying he was the

president of the company, Mr. Ivan Allen.
QUESTION:

The corporation.

MR. MC ALPIN:

The corporation.

president of the company at this time.

He was the
It was the

corporation.
QUESTION:-

It was the substitute for putting the

money in the bank?
MR. MC ALPIN:

Yes, your Honor.

As a matter of

fact, this case would not be here today if Ivan Allen
Company had just wanted to be safe and just leave the
$154,000 in cash because it is stipulated by the Government
that — and we so state — that the cost of our investment —
the cost of our earnings, which is the investment of Xerox
In liquid assets, is available to meet reasonable business
needs.
We say

the appreciation is not available, that

these are not earnings, the amount of earnings, so we paid
tax on $154,000

which went into the — which are our

accumulated earnings.

Had we left — and I don't think the

Government will contend otherwise — had we left that
$154,000 just In cash and had management which was hesitant
to make decisions, hesitant to look around and see what was
a good .investment for some contemporary money while they

7
were waiting to use this as operating capital, and this was
stipulated, as to costs it was operating capital —- had they
left that $15-4,000 in cash as operating capital, there would
be no claim because it is stipulsted in this case that the
"amount of all reasonable business needs —" that is, the
operating capital, $1 million 2 in 1965 and $1 million 4 in
1966 would equal exactly the accumulated earnings for the
years, the same years of 1965 and 1966 if the stock is
treated., as we respectfully submit, in earnings at the
investment that they had in liquid assets.
That would be $1 million 2, which would be the
accumulated earnings and $1 million 4.
So you see we are saying that the $154,000 and,
respectfully the $135,000 of those two years in cash, that
was all the earnings we had.
We put it into the liquid assets,

It was part of

our operating capital and available to meet the business
needs.
Now, here is the case.

And here is what the

Government says.
QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin.

MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Before you go on, you are talking about

unrealised appreciation —
MR. MC ALPIN:

We are, your Honor.

8
QUESTION:

— Investment in the stock market.

MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

As of what date — dates are we talking

about —
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Well —

Did the Government take year-end market

value ?
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Fiscal year-end, as I recall it.

MR. MC ALPIN:

Yes, sir, June the 30th of '65 and

June the 30th of ’66.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION;

Now, the Government contends —

Does the record show the high and low

market —
MR. MC ALPIN:

Statement of attorney at page 70 and

page 90 —
QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin, I am asking you another

question.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, excuse me.

Does the record shot* the high and low

market price of Xerox in each of the fiscal years in
question?
MR. MC ALPIN:

I am not certain it does.

It only

shows what the Government refers to as the net liquidation

9
value.

They show the market and then in the record, show

the cost of conversion which was the cost.

That does not

show the variation, no.
QUESTION:

Does that take into account the capital

gains tax?
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, the cost of conversion —

The cost of conversion is different

from the capital gains —
MR. MC ALPIN:

Oh, no, that’s the cost.

We — they

have stipulated that there would be approximately — I
believe 37.5 percent if we did sell that stock.

That would

be capital gains, the 6 percent other tax and then there is
some dispute about the Georgia tax. but then we claim that
there are three taxes which would apply if we were forced
to convert and therefore we would not have the full value,
even under their theory of available to meet business needs.
The cost

I think that is in the record, your

Honor, as stipulated.
QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin, on page 55 I think there is

a stipulation about the cost of converting and I suppose, had
the corporation, on December 30th — or two days before the
end of the taxable year or maybe on a fiscal year basis —
yes, June 30th ~~ on June 28th it had liquidated the Xerox
stock that the net figure after capital gain and capital
gain tax and brokerage commission — you wouldn’t be here

10

arguing.

Then there would be an improper accumulation of

surplus.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Had we converted it.

Had you converted it.

MR. MC ALPIN:

Yes, sir,, but what we would have

done, we would -— naturally, we would have paid the capital
gains tax shown at that time.

We would then have •— as we

did when we sold 1,000 shares of Xerox in 1966, we would
have put it Into our business for operation.
We would earn money.
tax on that as we did in 1966.

We would pay further income
You’ll notice our earnings

went up from $3^1,000 to $629,000 and x<re would have then —
yes, we would have used it and put it in.
Rut the question, you.r Honor, may be this:
the statute, 531 to 537,
a conversion?

Does

and the legislative history require

What the Government is claiming and which the

did successfully in the Fifth Circuit and prevailing upon
the Fifth Circuit to reverse Judge Morey, the District Judge,
established the principles which we are urging in this
Court.
What they would do then is force a conversion on a
day certain, the last day of our taxable year,

It would be

without reference at all as to whether or not business
judgment determined the time and the place and the best
conditions under which investments should be

sold and whether

11

or not it would be wise to sell all of it at that time.
QUESTION:
theory.

I didn't think that 'was the Government's

I thought It it as — first of all, I don't think

that the Government claims at all that this unrealized
appreciation is, itself, earnings and profits but that the
Government's theory is that with the existence of this large,
unrealized profit in the investment you made in this company,
that your other earnings and profits were more than available
to meet the needs of the business and. therefore, if —
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

That's true, your Honor.

— it were then declared, you are In

trouble under the statute,
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

What the Government says is -—

It doesn't say you should have sold your-

stock or had to sell your stock.
MR. MC ALPIN:

So much of it as would be necessai’y

to pay the amount of the dividends.

They claim — they say

we should have paid out all of our earnings and profits in
these taxable years.
Now, your Honor, what they —
QUESTION:
cash.

Often, earnings and profits are not in

That is true, isn't it?
MR. MC ALPIN:

That is correct.

That is correct.

It would be reflected in property very frequently, yes, sir.
But the point Is, the statute makes a comparison.

We would

12

submit that the statute makes a comparison as to earnings
with the reasonable business needs for the taxable year.
Now, what they say is that they are not taxed —
that is what they are taxed on, if that amount exceeds, when
you put market on it, that that is what they are taxing.
But what they do, your Honor, they go to liquid
assets and they claim that all amounts which we are holding
as investment in liquid assets under the Smoot case, which
we hold at cost, that is, our cost, $154,000, they take this
and they put the appreciated value on it and then they say
you look at total sources of funds in making the comparison.
Now, there is no statute, no regulation under 535 or
531 in any way that ever adopts except in this case and in
the Fifth Circuit — they did this in the tax court, which
we say is wrong.
Ke ask this Court to disregard that decision but
what they do is, that they take that figure which is in
total — which is in the liquid assets and they

have

interpreted, they say that all of your liquid assets, all
the current liquid assets, that when you compare that with
your business needs at a converted figure, which would be
the $miilion 6, that if that exceeds your reasonable business
needs, uhen you have accumulated earnings which you must
pay tax on, a penalty tax.
QUESTION:

Nov/ —

Now, wait a minute.

Let's assume that

13
a company buys some stock for $100,000 and it enhances and
increases in value 10 times and it is worth a million.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And there it is.

But the Government

doesn't contend you have to pay any of that out — any of
that enhancement out.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, they say —

But if you —- the next year if you have

a dollar's worth of earnings in profits, you have to pay
that out.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

They say —

But any year in which you have a loss,

you don't have to pay anything out.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

What they did —

It doesn’t say that, certainly, that the

enhancement is earnings ar.d profits which must be converted
and paid out.
MR. MC ALPIN:

They admit that that is not earnings

but, your Honor, the way they go about it is this, they
have applied a different rule.

They have

they are

forcing a conversion on your assets, so much of your liquid
assets are at cost.
QUESTION-'

They don't force a conversion.

They just

say that your current year's earnings end profits must be
paid out.

MR. MC ALPIN:

Well, but your Honor, the measure

there, the comparison is under Section 533 of the Code.

In

the comparison, the words are, "Earnings and profits" as you
measure, you compare your earnings and profits for that year,
accumulated earnings and profits — your accumulated
earnings and profits as against your reasonable business
needs.
Now, If you look at costs, our reasonable business
needs were $1 million 2 in '65.
were $1 million 2.
same.

Our accumulated earnings

They agree that then that is exactly the

Now, what they are saying [is] that you take total

resources, you take your liquid assets and when you take
liquid assets, you appreciate the stock which has a cost
value re'flected in liquid assets and we’ll come to that
word.

That is a very critical word because they have

misstated the rule, we submit, In the Smoot case.
QUESTION:

Which is the critical word?

MR. MC ALPIN:

The \tford "reflect."

The Smoot case,

in 196 —
QUESTION:

Incidentally, it is agreed that the

Xerox stock is completely marketable.

It is liquid, I take

it, here.
MR. MC ALPIN:

Yes, sir, but this case would, be

establishing a rule, though.
it is liquid.

In this particular instance,

We would lose value — and of course we have

15
commented upon it.

We would lose value of approximately —

from 30 to 37 percent or maybe by reason of conversion.
would be forced to sell.

We

It Is liquid.

But this would apply to closely-held corporations
in which one of the concerns would be evaluation — would a
closely-held corporation stock be able to have an available
ready sale?
You see, the Ninth Circuit, in Golconda, they held
that — even though that was tax court — they held it
wasn't applicable because it was a publicly-held corporation
so the imposition that would be established in this case —
and the Fifth Circuit has established It — says that at the
end of every taxable year, that all your total resources,
not ycur earnings and profits as the statute says, all your
total resources must be locked to, to see whether or not you
can meet their reasonable business needs.
Now, that means, on December the 31st, you have
effectively been told that that market value, whatever the
stock is at that time, the stock market value at that time,
establishes and you have been told, you are being placed a
market value on it.
Now, let's assume, your Honor, we say and you have
saici it in th.isCourt in Eisner, in 1938, you have very much —you have expressed concern about forced conversion, the
American Trading Company, Fourth Circuit, did the same thing

16
In 19 — I think In 1973.

What you are doing, December the

31st, you forced, you make him determine the market value on
that stock.

The question is, and this is where the error is,

there is no assurance that there will continue to be
available into the next year or even into January the 2nd.
Supposing an antitrust suit or something or some,
a fraud suit were filed.

You say that stock is worth a

billion and a half dollars or that an antitrust suit was
filed against Xerox Corporation on .January 1st.

You have

established that, not by business judgment but by the
determination of the Government.
The Government has come in and told you when your
sale is and on January the 2nd, the question is continued
availability to meet current operations business needs.
Now, on January the 2nd, something completely _
happens, as Judge Morey says, Secretary

of State Kissinger

goes to Europe or something.
QUESTION:

Well, even if that doesn’t happen, isn't

one of your responses to Justice White’s earlier question
that even though you are not told by the Government to
liquidate your Xerox stock, if you have to distribute all
of your earnings and profits to make up operating needs, you
are going to have to liquidate some of your Xerox.
MR. MC ALPIN:

Yes, but only — your Honor, only to

the extent of — yes, operating needs, $15^,000, we stipulate,

17
as part of our operating capital.

We would have to sell

$15*1,000 worth to take care of it, but we wouldn’t have to
sell all of it.
Now, what the Government — we xvouldn't have to sell
the whole thing, we would just have to sell that $15*1,000
amount.

Or maybe it may be more.

But what the Government

is saying is, when you measure it, they say we'd have to pay
out the whole $600,000 of profits for the taxable years.
They said that we should have paid all of that out.
Now, we did pay out a dividend and xve have been
paying out dividends but they said all of it should be
because when you take your appreciated value, they say they
are not taxing him but they say appreciation is not income
but what they have done is, they have converted earnings
in some form or another to

liquidity

-— they use it on the

liquidity test in which they say that you reach up in any
total resources.
Now, the question I want to make, the Smoot test,
they cite Smoot .

Smoot i^as a case in which they referred to

as pre-Smoot days and post-Smoot days.

Before, it was the

size of the accumulation or accumulated earnings.

They

looked at the accumulated earnings to determine whether or
not you had accumulated in excess of your reasonable
business needs.

18

In I960, the Smoot case, what they did, they
separated it.

They said "There are certain things.

the earnings.

There is no way you

your equipment."

One is

can use those to meet

They are in your plant and

So they took that out.

They said, "To the extent your earnings are there,
you can accumulate with impunity," and then they came and
said, "Now, what we should do f«rr the practicality of this,
and this is the ruling, and this is the established or
liquid assets — your liquid assets" and said that "So much
of surplus as is reflected in the liquid assets — so much
of the earnings as areN\-~ earnings are separate.
surplus as the same thing.

They use

"So much as is reflected in

liquid assets are to be measured against the reasonable
needs and if you exceed that, then you have violated the
statute."
QUESTION:

But wouldn't you be here making the same

argument if for some reason or another the company had
liquidated its Xerox stock and was sitting there at the end
of the year with the money in the bank , having paid its
capital gains tax?
Wouldn't you say that that —
MR. MC ALPIN:
your Honor.

Well, we were paid the dividends,

That was — if we had —

QUESTION:

Mo, no, no, wouldn't you still be

had, absolute cash, reflected enhancement in stock value

considered in -MR. MC ALPIN:

No, sir, no, sir, we have agreed

No, that isn't my point.

MR. MC ALPIN:

Is $154,000.

Yes, but —

MR. MC ALPIN:

And it is part of the reasonable-

business needs.
QUESTION:

Yes, but now let's assume — let's

assume that the stock had gone up to a million dollars and
you sold it.
MR. MC ALPIN:

We did do that in 1966.

and you nad the cash in the bank.

Now, is that available to

Is that it is unrealized —
MR. MC ALPIN:

That is correct.

QUESTION: — and unliquidated and you want the
privilege of a business judgment as to when to liquidate.
MR. MC ALPIN:

That is correct, your Honor.

And

while it may be that we are following and we say that it
has good reason, the legislative history of this particular
act since 1954 has been to favor the taxpayer, the language,
the words "earnings" were deliberate.
They are to determine the source from which the
funds are to be paid. The legislative history shows that
every amendment has been favoring the small businessman.
Just this year, the exemption has gone from
$60;000 to — in 1975, $175,000.
/

The question of reasonable business needs, you
used to have a specific plan.

It was amended Section 537 to

state "reasonably appealable needs" and here we come right
down, now, to include these new Ideas which the Government
is injecting into it.

There is no word of liquidity.

There

is no -- the statute doesn’t use the liquidity test.
The liquid assets test, which they have misconstrued

22
in this brief, we say, and the Fifth Circuit likewise, puts
your evaluation on a basis of measuring of earnings and while
the legislature has

Congress has written it this way andia

the Braunstein case in 1963, you recognized that, while it
was a matter of taxation, that that is the way the legisla­
tion was written and if it was a matter of that was the way
Congress did it and it didn't appear to be the type of
situation for judicial determination — we would submit,
ycur Honor, that the question of the legislative interpre­
tation is very deliberate here.

It is very much designed,

because they even recognize that they were concerned about
the

Government harassing — it is in our brief — harassing

small businessmen and they nearly took the penalty tax off,
*£nd another thing we must recognise is that this is
a penalty tax.

We have paid the income tax and the rule of

versus Gould is, in a case of penalty taxes, that you
must construe any enlargement or misconstruction or inter­
pretation question as against the Government and for the
taxpayer.
We say there is no ambiguity.

QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin, I don’t understand the

23
Government to be contending — of course, we’ll hear from
them in due course —- but I don't understand them to be
contending that this unrealized depreciation is earnings
and profits.
MR. MC ALPIN:

They contend It is not, vour Honor.

But what they do, they —
QUESTION:

They concede that it is not.

MR. MC ALPIN:

They reach out for a new term

called "total resources available."
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MC ALPIN:

That is not what the statute says.

The statute says, "earnings and profits available."
QUESTION:

Well, you did have earnings and profits.

MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And the Government position is, with this

unrealized appreciation of the Xerox stock, those earnings
and profit:! were unreasonably accumulated if they weren’t
paid out.
MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION :

But they —

Now, also, I should point out that the

dividend doesn’t have to be a cash dividend.

The dividend

could have been paid out in the form of Xerox stock to your
shareholders.
MR. MC ALPIN:
interesting.

Well, your Honor, that is very

I am glad you mentioned It because one of the

24
indications that cost is a proper value is that in the
regulations, the 562, when you give your unrelated stock
out, they give you credit only at cost.

They don’t give you

market yet what they are trying to do is trigger us at
market.
For example, when we gave — vjhen we transferred,
gave 870 shares of Xerox to our shareholders in 1965s it had
a market value of approximately $87,000.
If you will find on your balance sheet in that year,
we were given a credit for $6,500.
Section 312 of the Internal Revenue Code, talking
about earnings, says that there must be — that when there
is a recognition at the time, that that is when you gain
and that is when earnings become indicative.
There is nothing in the statutes —
QUESTION:

And is the shareholders’ basis on

receipt of a dividend in kind as the basis for each share
the corporation's cost basis?
MR. MC ALP IN:

Yes..

When the shareholder gets it,

they give the corporation only cost deduction but when he
gets it, he must pay market value.

He pays tax on the

basis of market value.
QUESTION:

Tax on the market value.

MR. MC ALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And then his basis, if he later sells

25

it, is the market value.
MR. MC ALPIN:

Is the new market and as American

Trading — you asked about the dividend — American Trading,
the Government made the same contention there.
They said what that would do was dissipate the
entire thing, that they would have to — that first you
would lose 37.5 percent.

The Government determines when you

sell your stock and on that very day you lose up to 37.5
percent In your value, which is not available to me, then
you get a cost deduction and that is treating you at market
and then your stockholder has to pay the full value when he
gets it.

Now — I'll finish — as the Court said in the Koch,
Nebraska, 1964 — I

hate to cite that to the

They say they

hope that they don’t see the day — the Court said — when
Government invades business to such an extent in this very
issue that they can determine when stocks are sold and
therefore they held in that case that forced

conversion 'was

not desirable, that what it was doing was putting Government
into the management seat and that all decisions of management
would be triggered thereafter.
We submit, as you have also said in Eisner, that
this was not the effect desired and that other issues, I
know, I could treat, but It Is treated in our brief.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. MeAlpin.

Mr. Crampton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. CRAMPTON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. CRAMPTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I’d like to start at the outset and try to put In
focus our understanding of the statutes that 7we have before
you.

The basic purpose, of course, is to avoid the so-called

incorporated "pocketbook."
Congress determined the stockholders should not be
permitted to accumulate idle funds in a Corporation in order
to avoid dividend taxes that they would otherwise have to
pay themselves.

As we look at the statute, there is a two­

fold test here.

The first, Section 531, imposes a tax on the
accumulated taxable income.

This is an additional tax on

income for a given taxable year.

It applies only to that

Income which is permitted to accumulate in that particular
year.
The income involved is determined basically from the
books of the corporation and it is determined In much the
same way as your regular corporate income is determined but
then modified for certain adjustments and so far, as we see
it, this is simple bookkeeping.

27
Vie come up with Income that is determined, the way
everyone understands it.

If you have no income, you have no

problem under this statute.
If income does exist, though, when you have done
this computing and it is not distributed as dividends to the
stockholders, then you look to see if this income can be
distributed without a hardship to the company.
The statute

speaks of the earnings and profits

being permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of
the business and I think the word "needs" here is the key
word for our second test.
It seems to us that this is an economic test.

Here,

the statute departs from concepts of taxable income that we
know under bookkeeping and it requires us to measure the
resources of the corporation against its needs.
The cases construing this statute refer to this as
"net liquid assets."

You take

your current assets and your

current liabilities and you see what are the economic
resources of the corporation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crarnpton —

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What do you mean by "liquid assets"?

How would you define them for this purpose?
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think those are assets that can be

readily converted to cash, probably inventory receivable,

28
things like that that would come into income within a year
or less than a year.
QUESTION:

Suppose you had a highly marketable

piece of real estate that you could sell any day?
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think that would probably be a

liquid asset, then, assume — on your premise.
QUESTION:

Right.

How ’would you determine the

value?
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think you have to determine the

value of these properties the same day we determine values
in many other areas, like you. would for state tax purposes
and the question of condemnation, you have a question here
of — it is a fact question that the Court would have to
consider.
QUESTION:

And that means that the Government would

get an appraiser and the taxpayer would get an appraiser
and they would be miles apart and they would compromise
somewhere in the middle, is what usually happens?
MR, CRAMPTON:

Well, I think, your Honor, In the

situation you gave, where you said it was readily saleable,
I doubt if you would have much of a valuation problem there.
If there Is somebody wanting to buy this property, you
probably have a pretty good idea what the sales price would
be.
QUESTION;

you would have to sell It, though, to

29
find out.
MR. CHAMPTON:

That Is true.

But that is true of

your — of any security,like the Xerox stock here would
have to be sold — there is some fluctuation in the market
from a day to day — but

don’t think you need to get

into that much of a refinement.

You look to see whether or

not there is current assets here sufficient that the
corporation could pay out these earnings

and profits

without disturbing its normal needs.
QUESTION:

Do you recall what the fluctuation in

Xerox stock was In the Year 197^?
MR. CRAMPTON:

No, sir, I don't.

I have got it

here but I know this was a volatile stock and In ?74 -QUESTION:
irorn 55 to 13*5.

It ran a range, according to Moody,

Now, which day would the Government pick?

MR. CRAMPTON:

I don’t think you would pick a day

on this, as we view the case, your Honor.

You would

look

at the situation over the year and if there Is a minimum
value of 55, certainly that would be, I think, a realistic
/alue to take, 11 that is the low, because we are —— we are
not trying to force a conversion here.
We are just saying that you know in the day to day
marketplace you have got some assets here and if you are
sure that you can realize at least $55 a share on it, then
that is something we should look at.

30

QUESTION:

Well, if there was a lower market value

in the fiscal year in question, the taxpayer could have
taken that for purposes of this case.
MR. CRAMPTON:

I would think that would be

re as onable.
QUESTION:

I thought you took the market value on

the last day of the taxpayer’s fiscal year.
MR. CRAMPTON:

I don't think it has

ever been

refined to that point.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought that was your claim in

this case.
MR. CRAMPTON:

No, we have stipulated what the

values were with counsel.

We were trying to get out of the

case some of these detailed factual things and we have
agreed with counsel for the Taxpayer that these were the
values and we have reduced those values by the capital
gains tax and by the brokerage points so as far as this
case is concerned, we have hard figures that these are the
fair market values that both parties agree they could use
and then we have the cost figures which are equally firm.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crampton, before you go on, how

would sound accounting

principles require a corporation to

carry the value of this Xerox stock at any particular date?
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Oh, I think cost, clearly.

There is no question about that, is

31

there?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Not in my mind.

But I do know that

most accountants will also — and this Taxpayer did —
they showed the market value at — I think at the end of
the year a3 not quite a footnote but a parenthetical addition
to their balance sheet.
QUESTION:

And if you filed a registration state­

ment with the SCO and undertook to show your assets at
markets you would get a deficiency immediately, wouldn't
you?
MR. CRAMPTON:

You'd certainly — they'd want it

explained very carefully how you determined that this was
the value you were putting on it.
QUESTION:

And the reason for that is that, there

is nothing definite, really definite, except cost.
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

That is true.

Market value varies, it can vary

with respect to stocks from day-to-day, vary widely.
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

I agree.

Mr. Crampton, what if this Taxpayer

had purchased Xerox at the highest point, whatever that was,
and that you were dealing with it in terms of today's
market value so that there would be an enormous unrealised
loss?
How would that figure In the process of taking

32

into consideration in the language of the regulations,
taking into consideration the total picture?
MR, CRAMPTON:
both ways.

It is our view that the rule works

If you bought at the higher figure

as your Honor

suggests, and now it is not worth that, then it is the
existing market value that you look at in determining the
needs of the business and that Was the holding of this
Court in the National Grocery case to which we referred in
our briefs and in that case they had earnings, I think, of
some $800,000 and then admitted security losses of $2 million
and the Court said, you do look at the present value of
those securities and there is a quotation in our brief
which is quite clear and I am coming to it in a minute, but
the Court then went ahead and imposed the tax because as
you looked over a ten-year average, they had accumulated
earnings and profits of something $5 million and had never
paid a dividend.
But the Court there announced a rule and we think
this Is Just the opposite of that — and we certainly say
the rule works both ways.
Now, I think the pivotal question here is how the
resources of the business should be measured.

The counsel

for Taxpayer has set forth some of the facts,

but I would

like to summarise them briefly against the statute.
As we have indicated, the facts have been

33
stipulated.

This corporation had earnings after federal

income taxes of about $180,000 in ’65 and almost $*100,000
in 1966.
It paid less than a third of these amounts out in
dividends.

In 1965 it paid $49,000 in cash dividends and

distributed 870 shares of Xerox stock.
In 1966 it paid out $50,000 in cash dividends
and a 10 percent stock dividend.
Its reasonable needs, as I say, have been
stipulated.

For 1965 they needed almost $2 million — I

mean, $1 million,200,000 and in 1966, they needed prac­
tically a million and a half and these are liquid assets
taken at book value and the parties have agreed that these
amounts equal the needs of the business.
These are the liquid assets and they are the
needs, if you look at the book figures.
QUESTION:
value?

Nox* —

taken
Well, what are liquid assets/at book

What are you talking about now?

The earnings and

profits of that year?
MR. CRAMPTQN:

Mo, these are the assets on the

books that I indicated I think that would be realized
within a year and the payables within a year.
It is the readlly-recelvable things that can be
converted into cash if you need to and that brings us right
to the point of how you value this Xerox stock.

We have —

34
QUESTION:

Because you concede that had there been

no appreciation in value of the Xerox stock, there could
have been no violation of this statute.
MR. CRAMPTON:
liability at all.

Under these facts, there would be no

We agree with that and I think the

stipulation was designed to point that up and the real
question is, we have also stipulated that after allowance for­
th© capital gains tax and brokerage fees, that the

liquid

assets of this corporation are practically double the
figures that we have stipulated as the corporate needs.
The liquid assets, if you look at fair market
va3.ue, are $2 million 2-soms in 1965 and over $3 million in
1966 and here, 76 percent of the voting stock was owned by
Iv&Si Allen, Senior and Ivan Allen, Junior and because of
that, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined this
assessment.
