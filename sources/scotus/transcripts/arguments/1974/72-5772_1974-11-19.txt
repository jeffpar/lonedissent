MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; We will hear arguments

Mr, Falk, you may proceed xtfhenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME B.FALK, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FALK; Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And may

it please the Court;
The issue which this case presents is whether an
indigent defendant who, under controlling State law, is not
free to select the counsel of his choice and who must permit
the lawyer appointed for him to control the presentation of
his defense, but if such a defendant is entitled to forego
counsel and represent himself; although no holding of this
Court squarely controls decision, this Court has, on several
occasions, spoken of a right of self representations in
circumstances which fairly can be described as considered
dicta.
The California Supreme Court, in People vs. Sharp,
two years ago, decided that there was no constitutional right
under State or Federal law as to representation, and this
case was decided pursuant to that controlling decision.
This petitioner was originally allowed by the trial
court to represent himself, having been quizzed at some
length by the trial judge and found to have voluntarily and

knowledgeably waived his right to counsel.
Then the Sharp case intervened, and some six days
later the trial court called petitioner before it, asked him
series of questions not concerning •— not addressed to his
waiver but addressed to his ability to represent

himself as

a defendant without a lawyer.
He answered those questions, I would — he answered
them rather well in most instances, but at the conclusion of
the colloquy the trial court found him to be inadequately
prepared to represent himself, and terminated his right to
represent himself and appointed the public defender.
The Court of Appeals affirmed on the authority of
Sharp, and the California Supreme Court denied a hearing.
This case has to be seen in the light of the
California lav/ and three aspects of California law which bear
on a defendant and his representation by counsel.
In the first place, it is clear that under
California law a defendant who is indigent, who seeks the
appointment of counsel, takes the lawyer assigned to him by
the court, be it Public Defender or a privata attorney.
The defendant has no right under any circumstances, which I
know of under the cases, to select the lawyer of his choice,
lie may, therefore, get a lawyer who he does not choose and
whom he may have no confidence in,
QUESTION:

There is nothing unusual about that.

5

MR. FALK:

No, Youx* Honor, there is not.

And, in

fact, in none of the three respects I'm about to speak to is
California law unusual, and I ought to say futther that in
none of those three respects do we quarrel with it, as
applied to a voluntary attorney-client relationship.
QUESTION: Do you think there was anything unusual
about people of modest means not always getting the lawyer
they would like to have to —
MR. FALK:

No, Your Honor, aid I perceive no

constitutional right to pick one's own counsel.
quarrel with California law in this respect.

I have no

I merely

describe it because it does bear on the consequences when
the defendant is unhappy.
The second feature of California law is that once
a lawyer is in the case, that lawyer runs the shov? — and
again, I don't quarrel with this, in the normal voluntary
relationship.

But the lawyer under California law has

broadest powers with respect to decisions in the course of
the trial.

There are only three exceptions that I know of:

one is the decision to plead guilty; second is the decision
whether or not to have a jury; and the third is the decision
whether or not to testify.
Save for :those three exceptions, the lawyer makes
all decisions.
Yes, Mr. Justice?

6

QUESTION; What’s the third one?
MR. FALK: Whether or not to testify, Mr. Justice
Blackmun.

Counsel cannot keep his client off the stand

against the client’s desire to testify.
QUESTION; Those standards are consistent x*ith the
standards established by the American Bar and Criminal
Justice Project, are they not?
MR. FALK:

They are identical with the ABA standards,

Mr. Chief Justice, and I again don’t quarrel with them.

I

think a lawyer has to run the show, and the consequence,
however, is that when the lawyer runs the show he makes
decisions for his client which directly affect constitutional
rights:

whom to cross-examine; whether or not to call a

particular witness; whether to make a motion to suppress
allegedly illegally obtained evidence; whether to seek a
continuance, and so forth.
Again, where the relationship is voluntary, we see
no difficulty with it.
Finally, the third aspect of California lav;, again
one which is not unusual, is that there is extremely limited
appellate review of the performance by a lawyer.

The standard

is set forth in our brief, it essentially boils down to
Egregious cases, reducing the trial to a farce or a sham.
Now, when the defendant and his lawyer are coerced
in their relationship with one another, then these three

7
concepts become manacles on the defendant's presentation of
his defense. This is so even if, as an objective matter, the
lawyer is a very commetent lawyer — and I’m prepared to
believe that most are in California and elsewhere.
But ’where the lawyer is less than competent or
where the defendant perceives him not to be competent, the
relationship becomes a terribly difficult one.

And I have

certainly no desire in this case to put the legal profession
on trial.

But some realism has to allox'/ consideration for the

fact that not all lawyers are able, that there are some
lawyers practicing criminal law in California and elsewhere
who are far less than able, and —
QUESTION: That’s true even of retained counsel.
MR. FALK:

That is true, even of retained counsel.

And, as I'll mention in a moment, one of the interesting
things is that the California court's solicitude with respect
to a defendant's presentation of his defense that was
asserted here does not carry over into the area of retained
counsel.
In fact, the California Supreme Court has gone so
far as to hold, in a case called Smith vs. Superior Court,
that an appointed lawyer who is found by the trial court to
be incompetent cannot be replaced over the objections of
the defendant.
The California Supreme Court decided that case in

8

1968; it's still good law.
Of course if the performance proves to be
incompetent, there may be a reversal, but the trial judge must
leave that relationship undisturbed even if the trial judge
comes to the conclusion that the trial counsel is incompetent.
QUESTION;

Do the California judges ever, in that

situation, appoint yet another lawyer to act as friend of
the court and assist?
MR. FALK:

I have never heard of them doing that

where there is a lawyer in the case.

They can and do appoint

standby counsel in cases where defendants seek to represent
themselves, or at least they did before the Sharp case.
There have not been many instances of self representation
since the Sharp case, to my knowledge.
QUESTION:

Of course, in mid-trial it would be kind

of hard to either replace the man who was assigned, and it
would be kind of difficult to get a nex</ man in, on the third
day of a trial, who could do much good? wouldn't it?
NR. FALK: The Smith case actually was a case that
had not yet commenced trial.

It had been a case in which the

lawyer — really, it was quite an extreme case. The lawyer
had been appointed previously, he represented the man in a
previous trial that had been reversed, sent back; in the
meantime the lawyer had been found incompetent by a federal
judge in another case, and the judge, in the Smith case, was

9

sufficiently concerned that he inquired and replaced the trial
counsel before trial started.
The California Supreme Court issued a writ in that
case and ordered the trial court to replace the original
lawyerT even though the trial court had found him to be
incompetent.
And so the California courts — the lesson from this
is that the California Supreme Court and the California courts
intervene very little in the presentation of a defense,
leaving that to the defendant and his counsel, except in one
instance, and that is this instance where the defendant seeks
not to have a lawyer.
QUESTION:

How many days had this trial gone on?

MR. FALK: The case I've described?
QUESTION:

This case.

MR. FALK: This case?

This case had not begun when

this —
QUESTION:
MR. FALK:

No part of the case had —
No, it was at a pretrial -— totally pre­

trial stage.
I recognize that the issue is quite different when
the trial has begun, and that presents a very different
problem that is not presented on this, on this record.
I mention all of these aspects of California law
because they make clear that compelling a client relationship

10

does more than the California Supreme Court recognized in the
Sharp case.

That is, it does more than give the defendant,

layered onto what he had before, give him more than a benefit,
even though he may not want it.
him.

It takes something away from

It takes away from him his rights, which we deem to be

granted him by the Sixth Amendment, to present the defense as
he sees fit.
It's that mistake in conceiving of the way the issues
arise in this case which led, not only the California Supreme
Court, in our opinion, but also quite recently the Third
Circuit, to reject the right of self-representation.
The Attorney General has sent to the Court a slip
opinion of the Third Circuit which follows, although without
citing it, follows the Sharp precedent.
It reasons, as did the California Supreme Court,
that all that is at stake here is the right to reject that
which the right-to-counsel clause of the Sixth Amendment
grants.

And thus it was able to see the case as largely

controlled by the Singer case, in which this Court rejected
the assertion that a defendant unilaterally may waive the
right to a jury trial.
There are two —
QUESTION:

We don't read the Sixth Amendment

language, as mandatory —
MR. FALK:

I beg your pardon, Mr. Chief Justice?

11

QUESTION:

We don't read the "shall" in the first

line of the Sixth Amendment as being, by clear implication,
part of the last phrase:

"And shall have the right to

....

assistance of counsel for his defense."
MR. FALK:

No, I read it together with the

confrontation and cross-examination clauses of the same
Amendment, which, in our view, create a right of the defendant
to present his own defense as he sees fit.
How, that —
QUESTION: Then you read "shall have" out of the
Sixth Amendment.
MR. FALK: Well, only in the sense that the
defendant may elect not to have that which the — that part
of the Sixth Amendment allows him to have if he wishes.
QUESTION:

Well, it would be easier to follow if

the vSixth Amendment read "may have the assistance of counsel",
would it not?
MR. FALK: Well, if it said that, Mr. Chief Justice,
then I take it the trial courts would have some discretion,
and of course trial courts don't have discretion to deny
counsel to a defendant who wants it.
I think that drafting it in that way would have
left that kind of discretion in the trial courts, and the
Framers surely didn't intend that.
I really need to elaborate, I think, on the point

12

I left hanging a moment ago, which is:

how we see the right

of a defendant to present his defense in the confrontation and
cross-examination clausesc
The Attorney General's position with respect to that
is that the right to present a defense, the right to confront,
the right to cross-examine, is a right that can be exercised
for a defendant by an agent, by a lawyer.
If that were so, then the right to be present, which
this Court held •— has held on many occasions — to be a part
of due process and part of the Sixth Amendment, would not
derive from the Sixth Amendment, because a defendant could
confront his accusers and cross-examine through a lawyer.
But the Court held, in Illinois vs. Allen, following a long
line of cases, the Sixth Amendment gives the defendant the
fight to be present.
And in, I think, probably —
QUESTION: Well, with some qualification.

With some

qualification.
MR. FALK:

It's a right that can be lost by mis­

conduct.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR.FALK:

And we — I should say, so I'm clear on

that point — we quite agree that a defendant who waives his
right to — a defendant may waive his right to represent
himself in the same way, by misconduct; may be taken from him

13
just as it was in Illinois vs, Allen»
I should also say that this defendant was entirely
respectful on the record, there was not any instance of that
in this case, nor in any of the 76 other reported appellate
cases involving the right of self-representation in California,
which we've collected in an appendix to our brief.

That

kind of outrageous conduct that the courts on Illinois vs.
Allen and in Mayberry vs. Pennsylvania is a rarity.
But in the right-to-be-present case, the Court has
seen the right of self-representation as involved.

In

Snyder vs. Massachusetts, the Court ex plained the right to
be present as deriving from the defendant's right, and I
quote,

"to give advice or suggestions or even to supersede

his lawyers altogether and conduct the trial himself."
So that is part of why we see the Singer case as not
controlling, because Singer involved simply the right to
reject a protection of the Constitution, and this involves
another part of the Constitution, the right to present a
defense.
But there's another reason, too, why Singer doesn't
control here.

The Singer case was a case where the Court

properly recognized that the government, as a litigant —
it used those exact words — the government, as a litigant,
has an interest in seeing a particular kind of fact-finder, a
jury o

14
Here the government as a litigant is neutral.

It

has no interest in seeing who the — how the defendant presents
his defense or who represents him.

And the government in

turn, the prosecutor in this case, made no objection when the
defendant sought to represent himself? it took no position.
He saw himself as neutral on that, on that issue.
QUESTION:

Do you think the courts should give

controlling or even very much weight to what a prosecutor
thinks about that subject?
MR. FALK:

Well, I think not, and — but in a

different kind of case, which I'm trying to distinguish, they
should.

That is, where they —
QUESTION:

The prosecutor might be overjoyed at

having a defendant waive counsel, might he not?
MR. FALK:
sides of that.

I have heard prosecutors speak on both

I think that the --

QUESTION:

I said "might", because it would depend

on the circumstances.
MR. FALK:

The proper answer is, I think, the one

implied in your question; it's not the prosecutor's affair.
And that's precisely the point I'm trying to make? which is,
that, unlike Singer, where the prosecutor had a legitimate
interest as a litigant in a particular kind of fact-finder,
the prosecutor was neutral here.
It is also not true that

15

QUESTION:

Hr. Falk, don't you think the State or

the government really has an interest to see that justice is
done and that it is done in a way so convincing that it wins
popular approval?
MR. FALK:

I do think so, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

But I would respectfully suggest that chaining a defendant to
a lawyer he doesn't want is not the way to accomplish that.
Now, I know that —
QUESTION: Well, he doesn’t want any lawyer, he
just wants himself, in the context of this case -MR. FALK:

Well, in this case he would have — I

don't believe it's shown by the record, there was a private
lawyer he would have accepted, but it wasn’t within his
ability to have that lawyer.
QUESTION:

No, they always want the notorious or

celebrated ones.
MR, FALK:

This one happened not to be the case,

this one happened to be a relatively obscure and perfectly
competent lawyer who couldn't work for free, and that's just
how it happens, it’s quite true that that sometimes is the
case.
But what —
QUESTION: Doesn’t 'the State also have an interest
in securing criminal judgments against later collateral
attack based on a contention as to whether the waiver of

16

counsel was voluntary or not?
MR. FALK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it does.

And the — the position that we take here on that point is
that — is that the defendant is bound by what happens at his
trial.

His waiver comes at the point in vrhich he elects

knowledgeably to forego an opportunity he had to have counsel.
And to —
QUESTION: Would you say a defendant wh'o is in the
position of your client, but — at that stage, who says, "I
elect to represent myself", would you say that the defendant
in that position could never later raise the question of the
voluntariness of his waiver of the right to counsel?
MR. FALK:
QUESTION:

Oh, no, he may certainly —
Well, so the State is solving that

problem, potential vulnerability to collateral attack, by
appointing counsel for him,* right?
MR, FALK: Well, that is, in my view, a pretty weak
basis on which to deny somebody -- if that were the only
interest at stake

his opportunity to present his own

defense.
It certainly has the right, the court certainly has
the right, and I think the duty, to question the defendant
very carefully as to the state of his knowledge and under­
standing at the time he makes his decision.

We set out in the

appendix a very excellent model colloquy prepared by Judge

17
Ely in an opinion in the Hodge case.
If that is done and the defendant adheres to the
position that he wants to represent himself, he's bound by
that decision.

The court can protect itself by an adequate

colloquy — indeed, the one in this case, by the trial judge
on the first instance, I think, would have survived any kind
of scrutiny, it was a very careful, good job of seeing that
the defendant knew what he was doing, and the judge said
to him —
QUESTION:

What if the judge asks him all the

questions that you suggest he asks him and a lot more, too,
and becomes convinced that he really is quite incompetent to
conduct his own defense, and then concludes that his x^aiver
cannot possibly be intelligent, might be quite voluntary
but it isn’t intelligent.
MR. FALK:

Well, I —

QUESTION:

And I suppose you would suggest that the

waiver must be intelligent as v/ell as voluntary?
Is that right or not?
MR, FALK:

Well, I — only in the sense that he

has to understand that the trial judge thinks he’s making a
terrible mistake.

He does not have to understand in order

to make an intelligent x-zaiver --QUESTION:

So you say, your ansx^er is, No, it

doesn't have to be intelligent, it only has to be voluntary?

18

MR. FALK:

I'm having difficulties with the words,

but I think that is the proper conclusion.

I —- well, let

me put it, if I may, a slightly different way:

He does not

have to show that he will do a good job, is a competent selfrepresenter, if you will.

If that test gets applied, then,

as most of the courts that have considered the matter recognize,
there will be very, very few instances in which defendants
will satisfy a skeptical trial judge that he's going to do as
good a job as a lawyer.
QUESTION:
extreme:

Let's take an extreme example, obviously

The defendant is a highly intelligent deaf-mute,

in writing he communicates or through other method's with the
judge, sufficiently to show that it is a voluntary waiver of
counsel.

Do you think the Constitution requires the court to

go ahead and have this deaf-mute undertake to defend himself?
Just because he is a •— he's satisfied it is

voluntary, and

that the man is a very intelligent person.
MR, FALK:

I think that the question is one that has,

there are other ways of dealing with it, as I presume there
are wa^s of bridging the communications problem with the
defendant.

He's going to have the same problem with a lawyer,

I suppose.
The problem, if I may turn the facts around, the real
problem comes frequently where the defendant is just not as
good as the judge would like him to be, in terns of understanding

19
legal issues.
QUESTION:

Well, going to the waivers of some of

these constitutional provisions, in many of the States as in
the Federal statutes, when a defendant seeks to waive trial
by jury, he is not permitted to do so unless the prosecutor
concents and unless the judge consents, all three participants
must consent or it can't be done.
Does that policy suggest something about this case?
MR. FALK:

I think not, because of the difference

between the prosecutor's interest in having a jury trial and
the prosecutor's lack of interest in seeing that the
defendant has a particular type of defense.
QUESTION: Does it not go to what Mr. Justice
Blackmun was intimating, that the State has such a strong
interest in a proper trial that it sets up these additional
safeguards over and above the Constitution?
MR. FALK:

A whole series of questions I think all

touch on the very problem of the inadequate defendant.

He's

made an intelligent waiver, in the sense that he understood
what he did; but he’s not intelligent about being a lawyer.
And it seems to me the answer to that has to be presented at
two levels:

philosophical and practical.

At the philosophical level, I think we have to
conclude

that constitutional rights are not dependent for

their existence on the ability of the person who owns them,

20
has them, and to exercise them intelligently or well.
The right of free speech can be exercised by an utter fool,
as cases like Coan vs. California, and. many others demonstrate.
QUESTION:

Would you help me on this?

I just

don't understand how you — what questions can be answered to
show that you intelligently waive your right to counsel?
Are you going to do a little Wigmore with him, or — how are
you going to do it?
MR. FALK:

You ask him a series of questions.

Does he understand that he has a right to a lawyer?

He answers

yes.
Does he understand that the court thinks he's got a
very complicated case here, the court thinks he's very illadvised, that a lawyer can do a better job for him,* -the
court has seen many such cases; does he understand that?
The court wants him to have a lawyer.

Does he

understand that?
He answers questions of that kind all the way through.
Does he understand what the —■

And he said, Can you handle your own

MR. FALK: That I think is not a question.

The

court may ask it — and it probably ought to ask questions
like that, to see —
QUESTION: But if he says yes, that wouldn't mean a

21

thing to me, because he doesn't know a defense from a hole
in the ground.
MR. FALK:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I agree with you,

and I think we have to —
QUESTION:

Well, do you quarrel with ■— at that

stage, the judge saying, Go ahead and conduct your defense,
but I’m going to leave that lawyer there in case you need him.
MR. FALK: Absolutely not.

I quite agree that that's

what the trial judge should do, that's what the ABA standards
committee thought the judge ought to do,
QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't object to that?

MR. FALK: Would not object to that. But the
difference is — the difference is that that lawyer is there
to provide such assistance as the defendant wants.

He'll

answer questions, he may even volunteer a little advice,
but he doesn't present evidence, he doesn't prevent the
defendant from presenting evidence.

That's the key, you see,

that the lawyer in California —

In California, the defendant is precluded by the
trial judge — by the trial counsel from presenting evidence,
if he has — if the trial counsel doesn't want him to.

He's

precluded from cross-examining if the trial counsel doesn't
want him to, and that's the problem to which I address myself,
and the difference between -the appointment of counsel and the
standby counsel, which the ABA thinks is the way to solve the
problem is that the standby counsel doesn't interfere in
those kinds of decisions.
QUESTION; But you wouldn't require the appointment
of standby counsel, would you?

I think that the —

No, I do not think that the right to

it might not be the final answer, if he just says:

"I waive.

I understand, Judge, I'm doing myself a terrible disservice."
What you're really suggesting, then, is that he
should say to the judge:

"I want to run this trial.

must appoint me a counsel to help me, but I am running the

MR. FALK:

My client’s position is simply that he

wanted to do it alone, he didn't care to have a standby
counsel.
If a defendant'wanted a standby counsel, I am not
sure that he isn't constitutionally entitled to it,

I

recognize the issue isn't presented here.
But the reason that I say that is that the Sixth
Amendment clauses that are a part of this case can be — are
not mutually exclusive -QUESTION:

Yes, but, Mr. Falk, by rule of court,

Faretta.

Because standby counsel doesn't have the

authority to run the show.
MR. FALK:

Exactly, Mr. Justice Brennan.

QUESTION:

As I understood your brief — is there

constitutionally only to the extent that the man, the defendant
himself, wants to consult him and use him.
MR. FALK:

He's there, but he provides no assistance

unless ~“
QUESTION: Right.

And as I further understood your

brief, you do not say that the Constitution requires any
such standby counsel.
MR. FALK:

We —- we have not gone that far.

I

think -QUESTION:
MR. FALK:

That’s what I thought.
— that’s an open question.

I think that that standby counsel alternative, plus
the power of the trial judge to run his courtroom provides a
very adequate answer to the problem that Mr. Justice Blackmun

25

raised early on, which is the problem of the. inadequate
defendant and the need of the courts to see that everybody
gets a fair trial.
QUESTION:

That bridges the gap.
Well, your answer to Mr. Justice Stewart

means, counsel, the court says: "All right, go ahead, defend
yourself."
He says,"Well, I'd like to have counsel sit behind
me to help me if I need him."
"No, you want to run your own show, you run it;
I'm not going to appoint anyone."
MR. FALK:

I have to say candidly that I think an

argument can be made that a defendant who chooses to —has his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense is also
entitled to the assistance of counsel of a standby nature.
And you can read those clauses texturally —
QUESTION:

Well, then you're departing from —

you're now departing from your brief, very explicitly.
MR. FALK:

I'm answering a question candidly that

I didn't — couldn't raise in —
QUESTION:

Well, that question must have occurred

to you in writing your brief.
MR. FALK:

Well, I didn't reach it in the brief.

QUESTION:

You covered it; you dealt with it,

explicitly, and —
MR. FALK:

No —

QUESTION;
MR. FALK;

— you said you're not claiming that,
I’m not claiming it on behalf of this

petitioner, because I don’t have to.

The problem isn't

raised by his case, he didn’t ask for that.
I did not — I’m quite sure, Mr. Justice, I did not
disclaim that position because it was in my mind that the two
can be read consistently in that way.
QUESTION:

I take it you'd be willing to concede

that we must consider that aspect, whether you press it on us
or not.
MR. FALK:

I think so, Mr. Chief Justice, and that’s

why I've answered the questions I have.
QUESTION;

I take it you’re aware that in most

cases, when a judge appoints standby counsel, that standby
counsel is instructed to do everything that he would do if
he were retained counsel, whether the defendant likes it or
whether the defendant dees not like it.
MR. FALK;

Well, there are —

QUESTION: That’s what the standards of the American
Bar reflect.
MR. FALK:

They indicate, though, Mr. Chief Justice,

that the standby counsel is not to ask questions, and not to
introduce evidence, and not — and has no oower to preclude
the defendant from doing so.

So in those respects he is not

able to interfere with the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights

27
to present his defense.
QUESTION: Are there many lawyers who are willing to
act as standby counsel on that capacity?
MR. FALK:

I would think that there are as many

lawyers who are willing to do that as who are willing to
endure the awful relationship of having —• with a client \7ho
doesn’t want them.
QUESTION:
relationship.

Well, but you’ve still got the

At least when you’re representing the guy,

your judgment, your professional judgment is given some
weight.

But it seems to me the standby counsel is the worst

of both worlds.
MR. FALK:

Well, I — this is a personal answer,

I have no statistics for you.

My personal reaction is quite

the opposite, I would prefer —
QUESTION.:

No problem.

MR. FALK:

— I would prefer to serve as a standby

counsel, and those lawyers who I've had an opportunity to
question on it share the same view.
QUESTION:

Mr. Falk, let me get this thing

straightened out about this standby counsel.

I want to —

when I was talking to you, did I understand you and I to be
talking about standby counsel who only gave advice and did
whatever the man told him?
MR. FALK:

That’s correct.

28

QUESTION:

That was what we we re talking about.

MR. FALK:

That's what I was talking about?

Mr. Justice —•
QUESTION: And that's the standby counsel you're
talking about?
MR. FALK:
QUESTION s
MR. FALK:
QUESTION:

That's right? that’s in the -—
Not the one that actually takes over?
That’s correct.
Mr. Falk, we've showered you with

questions here, but I want to be sure — do I correctly
understand your position to be that if Mr. Faretta were
permitted to represent himself he would thereby no longer have
a claim later for incompetency of counsel?
MR. FALK:

Yes, that is clearly my position.

QUESTION:

You concede this?

MR. FALK:

I concede it.

And I concede further that he would not have the
right to any advantage over the position that a defendant
would be who had a lawyer. Any claim that should have been
raised at trial wasn't included, in the same way.
QUESTION:

Do you think a court, the trial court, the

presiding judge, or an appeallate court is going to consider
itself bound by that kind of proposition?
MR. FALK:

I think it — I think it will, because

it is the logical consequence of everything that has been said

29

on the right of self-representation.

Anything else makes

the right —
QUESTION: V7ell, if we concede your premise, it is
the logical consequence; but you don't really think that an
appellate court would refuse to examine a claimed faulty
waiver by a defendant?
MR. FALK:

No, not a faulty v/aiver.

I think it has

to be able to look at that in the same way that it can look
at a guilty plea.

But beyond that it — I believe it xtfill

not allow a defendant to profit from his decision to repre­
sent himself, and ought not to.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

In this case — before you sit down, Mr.

Falk — the trial court purported to find that your client,
your present client, the defendant, did not make an intelligent
and knov?ing waiver of his constitutional right to be
represented by an attorney.
Now, that's the posture, I mean that's the fulcrum
on which he —■ the court decided,
MR. FALK:

That is a finding I must respectfully

say, which is supported by no evidence in the record, because
the colloquy upon which that finding was based did not
examine the question of the defendant's knowledge with respect
to the waiver, did not go over the same ground that the
original judge had covered.

He asked only questions about

30

the ability of the defendant to conduct the trial»
all that that judge inquired of.
handled

That’s

It was a different judge ^vho

who took the waiver in the first place. .
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

But that was the finding,

wasn't it?
MR. FALK: Well, that's a question of constitutional
fact, which I think this Court must make a judgment on.
QUESTION:
with that?

And what did the appellate court do

Did it —
MR. FALK:

Under the California rule of the Sharp

case, and earlier cases, that is a sort of substantial-evidence
rule, and the court yielded to what it called the discretion of
the trial court in that regard.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Falk.

Mr. Schwab.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD J. SCHWAB, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SCHWAB:

Thank Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court:
The issue of whether or not the defendant has a
constitutional right to represent himself without counsel and
whether this exists in criminal trials has been described,
in the words of the Second Circuit, as whether or not a defendant
has a constitutional right to go to jail under his own banner.
I submit, Your Honors, that the defendant has no such

31
right.

Rather, he has a. .right under the Constitution to a

fair trial.

A good working definition of a fair trial was

set forth in the California case of People vs. Sharp, in
7 Cal. 3d, defining it as follows, quote:
"Proceedings which will accord him the fullest
opportunity to preserve all trial rights and successfully
defend against the charges."

Unquote,

A fair trial is the definition of due process,
and to mandate that a defendant has a constitutional right
to defend himself without counsel could have the opposite
effect.

A good example is this case, and I must differ with

petitioner in his interpretation of the taking away of the
appropriate privileges in this case.

The defendant was

confused as to the hearsay rule, and equated it to the bestevidence rule,
QUESTION:

Is this peculiar to the defendant, do

you think, or don't you think other lawyers may suffer the
same confusion?
MR. SCHWAB:

I think that, well, perhaps on

individual points, but it goes on.
For example, he also x/as confused as to the number
of peremptory challenges.
Now, an attorney may be confused on one or two
points of law, but this was a continuous —
QUESTION;

He had. the number of peremotories,

32
that you get, it was •—
MR. SCHWAB:

Well, he said there were twelve

peremptories, and under California Penal Code, Section 1070,
in a case of this type, he has ten.
QUESTION:

Oh, well, the record simply didn't reveal

that he was wrong, I guess, in saying —
MR. SCHWAB:

Yes, under Penal Code, Section 1070,

he only has ten.
We are arguing this case, Your Honor, —
QUESTION:

Is that really so serious?

The court

can straighten him out easily enough.
MR. SCHWAB:

That's true, but the problem is, if

he was in ignorance and all of a sudden had used up his ten,
and thought he had two more, it may be too late for the
court to —
QUESTION:

Well, we've had records up here with

retained counsel, would complain the.y weren't advised as to
how many peremptories they were entitled to in a joint trial,
for instance.
MR. SCHWAB:
QUESTION:

That's true, but the — as —
But they never represented themselves

either, I guess.
MR. SCHWAB:
QUESTION:
MR. SCHWAB:

Sorry, Your Honor?
Nothing.

Go on.

Rut as this Court said in Mayberry vs.

33

Pennsylvania, that laymen often make awkward scenes; and I
think this is true much more of laymen than ever of attorneys.
And what we're arguing

—- and what California is

arguing is not that the defendant can never represent him­
self, but rather that he has no constitutional right to do
so; and this, in turn, would give a trial court a wide
discretion in deciding xdiether or not to accept a waiver.
I submit, Your Honors, that petitioner has not
shown the source of any constitutional right of self-repre*

sentation.

History shows no right, and we have discussed

the history in our briefs.
QUESTION;

But —

Well, the other side has discussed

history and has come uo with the opnosite result.
Let me ask this:

Your statement about constitu­

tional right is out o£ line, apparently, with the policy in
36 States that Mr. Falk has set forth in his brief, which
have constitutional rights under the State Constitutions.
Do you think this is bad policy?
MR. SCHWAB:

Is this what you’re arguing?

Oh, I think — well, I don't argue

the policy of the States, because this is a statutory
scheme; what I do argue here is the constitutional basis,
whether or not an individual State would desire to give a
defendant the right of self-representation is really not the
issue. The question is:
right?

And ---

does he have the constitutional

34
QUESTION:
MR. SCHWAB:

A Federal constitutional right.
Correct.

Under the Federal Constitu­

tion.
And. under the coromon law, self-representation was
not a right but was a tyrannical practice, enforced by the
Crown and the Kings to insure victories, and to insure that
dissidence would be kept down.
And this, of course, was the hallmark of the
Stuarts.
Now, the Colonies, when, they began having their
own various States and Colonies, had their own individual
types of charters and constitutions.

Four States,

Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Mew Hampshire,
made provisions for both counsel and self-representation.
The Judiciary Act of 1789 was debated at around
the same time of the Bill of Rights.

The Judiciary Act of 1789

gave both a right to counsel and a right to self-representation.
Yet, the Bill of Rights, the Sixth Amendment, gives
no such right of self-representation, while giving a right
to counsel.
Thus it appears that the Framers purposely did not
want to make self-representation a. constitutional right.
A similar type of inference and a similar type of logic
was made in the case of Singer vs. United States by this Court,
where the Court had held that a right to waive a jury does

35
not spring from the right to a jury.
And the Court stated, quote:

"Indeed, if there

had been recognition of such a right, i.e., the right to waive
jury, it would be difficulty to understand why the Sixth
Amendment was not drafted in terms which recognized an
option."

Unquote.

380 U.S. at 31.

Thus, we submit, the history gives no right and
in fact the changes in history, cases such as Gideon, and the
?
recent cases of Soto in the Third Circuit and People vs.
Sharp in our own State of California — my own State of
California, seem to show a greater reliance on the necessity
of counsel and questions any possible right of selfrepresentation as being a constitutional right.
Due nrocess does not give a right to represent
one's self, rather it is a right to a fair trial.

A fair

trial is fair if there are fair and efficient court orocedures.
Times have changed since —■ the last hundred years,
and defenses are becoming more and more complex.
longer the s.imole "Did you do it?"

It’s no

A man can shoot somebody

in front of a thousand witnesses, yet have a oerfeetly good
defense.
In California, for example, we have a very complex
defense known as diminished capacity, and this defense is,
more or less, that if a defendant cannot attain a certain

36
state of wind to commit a certain offense by reason of mental
deficiency or disease or intoxication, he cannot be guilty of
that offense or that degree»
Now, it would be almost impossible for a defendant
in propria to raise this in California, because:
would have to know the law»

one, he

The lav/ is very technical.

Two, he would have to know how to examine and cross-examine
experts.
And three, perhaps most important of all, he would
need to have an objective understanding and appreciation of
the applicability of the defense of diminished capacity»
Furthermore, defendant should know —* would have to
know the complex

motions to suppress by reason of search

and seizure, and proper forums.
Also, a defendant could be under drugs or withdrawal
and by reason of this not be able to defend himself properly.
For example, in this particular case, the attorney
for Mr. Faretta said that at the time of the commission of
the offense that the defendant, Faretta, was involved in
dangerous drug activity.

This is found on page 64 of the

Appendix.
Therefore, because of the defenses and because of
the mental problems that may face a defendant, there would be
no right to self-representation.
Furthermore, the law is changing rapidly, and because

37

of these rapid changes , this would mandate the use of
counsel.
Recently this Court has come down with the decisions
of Illinois vs. Allen, Taylor vs. United States,

The former

stating that if the defendant becomes disruptive, he could
be removed from the courtroom; the latter saying that if the
defendant should leave in the midst of his trial, the trial
could go on without him.
If a defendant does not have co-nsel, and either of
the two aforementioned events take place, the proceedings
would unintentionally become an inquisitorial proceeding,
where no defense is tendered at all.
Again, we submit, Your Honors, that due process
requires a fair trial, and not subjective

wins.

To say otherwise might encourage a cynical view
that is more important that the accused believe that he is
getting justice rather than actually get justice.
Fairness, to be meaningful, -QUESTION:

Is there any other right the defendant

has that he can't waive, other than this one?
HR, SCHWAB:
QUESTION:
MR. SCHWAB:
QUESTION:
my question.

You mean under the Constitution as to --Unh-hunh.
Well, under California law —
Under the United States Constitution is

38

QUESTION; Well, the right to trial by jury under
the Singer case.
MR. SCHWAB:

That he cannot waive, that's correct.

As to -- I know —* well, I know of no right which
is not specifically enumerated in the Constitution which can
be, to my knowledge, constitutionally waived.

There have been

no cases as of yet, to my knowledge.
Singer is the perfect example.
Petitioners pointed out that counsel in California
make binding decisions, but these decisions which he lists
in his brief are very complex indeed, and are in the purview
of a technician.
Thus we need technical minds to best direct a
defense.
The purpose of our legal profession, -the training
involved, is to assure that trained individuals can be
advocates protecting the client's interest.
Now, petitioners argue that indigents may get a —
may not choose counsel in California and may not get along
with them.

However, I think that this can be countered

because, first of all, a trial is not a popularity contest
to be won by smiles and handshakes, but, rather, is serious
business necessitating the best technical minds available.
Furthermore, a defendant could possibly associate
with the path of the mentally ill and not get along with any

39

person.
Thirdly, an attorney will have an objective under­
standing of the case which a defendant might not have because
of hi3 personal involvement in the charges.
The purposes of due process are supported by the
use of counsel.
The Court has recognized this in such landmark
cases as Powell vs, Alabama and Gideon vs. Uainwright.
Again, as Singer has pointed out, there was no
right to a jury trial — there's no right to a jury trial
waiver, and this lack of a jury trial waiver did not
violate any constitutional right.

That the Constitution

guaranteed the defendant a right to a jury, which is what
the defendant got.
In the same manner, there is no right to appear
without counsel.
And since appellant — since the petitioner received
a trial with counsel, he received what the Constitution
guaranteed.
QUESTION:

In California, may a defendant unilaterally

waive trial by jury without the consent of the court and the
prosecution?
HR. SCIINAB:

No.

Under California law, the

prosecution also has a right to —
QUESTION: The court, too?

40
MR. SCHWAB;

I believe the court also, I —

QUESTION: The same as the Federal, then?
MR. SCHWAB:

I8m not positive as to the court, but

I know for sure the prosecution must also waive.
Petitioner argues that since there is a correlative
— that since there’s a right to counsel there must be a
correlative right to self-representation.
As mentioned before, there's no historical source of
such a right.
Secondly, he mentioned such cases as Ad arris vs. United
States ex rel McCann, which has dicta on this point.
However, these cases came down before the cases of
Gideon and Singer, which have supported the necessity of
counsel.
The Singer doctrine also came down after these
opinions, and thus, because a defendant may be able to waive
counsel would not mean that he has a right to waive counsel,
because, as this Court said in Singer, quote, "The ability
to waive a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry
with it the right to insist upon the opposite of that right."
380 U.S. at 34-35.
Thus, the correlative argument falls on its face,
because the Constitution guarantees a right to a fair trial,
and a right to due process.
And it would be absurd to say that there would be a

41
correlative right to an unfair trial and to a lack of due
process.
Thus, Your Honors, in conclusion, I submit there
is no right to seif-representation under the Federal
Constitution or under either an historical Sixth Amendment
or due process interpretation.
Rather, what is mandated is a fair trial.
As the trial court cogently said in this case, to
Faretta, quote:

"I have seen more people represent themselves

convict themselves - where, if they just sat down and let
somebody who knew what they were doing do it, could well have
won the lawsuit."
