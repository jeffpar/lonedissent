MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-759, Edwards against Healy.
Mr. Vick, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORMi ARGUMENT OF KENDALL L. VICK, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. VICK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
I am Kendall Vick, Assistant Attorney General of
the State of Louisiana, for Governor Edwards and others.
This case was brought by Ms. Ilealy

and others to

challenge the Lousiana Constitution and statutes exempting
women from service on juries unless they filed a written
declaration of desire to serve.
This matter was heard before a three-judge panel in
the Eastern District of Louisiana, comprised of Judge

Wisdom

from the Fifth Circuit, Judges Rubin and Blake West from the
Eastern District of Louisiana.
They found Hoyt vs. Florida, decided by this Court
in 1961, a sterile precedent, no longer binding, and held
that the constitution and statutory provisions of Louisiana
unconstitutional, as a denial of due process.
After appeal in this case had been perfected, the
people of the State of Louisiana adopted a new Constitution,
which, the Attorney General believes, will moot the issue

4
presently before the Court, on January 1st, 1975.
We filed a Supplemental Memorandum, typewritten,
and a Supplemental Brief, printed, reflecting those changes.
Article V, Section 33(A) of the new Constitution of
Louisiana makes every citizen who has attained majority
eligible to serve on a jury*

And 33(b) of Article V of the

new Constitution of Louisiana leaves exemptions to the
Supreme Court of Louisiana.
In the Supplemental Brief that I have supplied to
the Court, suggesting mootness, Exhibit 1, starting on page 5
of the Supplemental Brief, which is a verbatim transcript of
the Convention’s proceedings on the Thirty-sixth Day, August
24, 1973, which deals with this particular section of the
new Constitution, clearly evidences the overwhelming intention
of that body, made up of 132 citizens of the State of Louisiana,
that women be called for jury duty on the same basis as men.
Exhibit 2 in the Supplemental Brief, to be found
starting on page 25, is a Draft Order of the Supreme Court of
the State of Louisiana implementing the intention of the
Convention.
QUESTION;
Draft Order?

Mr. Vick, what is the status of that

Does the word "draft" mean it hasn't really been

promulgated yet?
MR, VICK:

I dare say, if it please the Court, it's

very much like a draft opinion that you would circulate to your

5

brethren.

I checked with the Director of the Judicial Council

arid also with Justice Tate, who is the author of this Order,
on Friday, and he said it was still being circularized to
h.is brothers.
I might add, in further answer to your question,
Your Honor, I was a Delegate to the Constitutional Convention,
Justice Tate, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of
Louisiana, was a Delegate to the Convention, he is the author
of this Draft Order, and I have no doubt in my mind, that this
Order will be, in substantial form, the way it appears here.
Furthermore, on Friday, —•
QUESTIONS

How in the world can you speak for the

Supreme Court of Louisiana?
MR. VICK:

I don't presume to do so. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said —

MR. VICK:

I don’t presume to do so.

I was only

reflecting —
QUESTION:
MR. VICK:
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you were saying
I was only —
— the facts are that one man has

drafted an Order, one member of the Court, and has
circulated, period.
Is that the facts?
MR. VICK:

That is a fact.

QUESTION: Do we have anything more than that?

6
HR. VICK:

As of Friday, I have nothing more.

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. VICK:

Well, as of today?
As of today, nothing more.

This morning —
QUESTION:

Well, do you have an opinio- as to

what's going to happen?
MR. VICK:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

I was about to say that on Friday the Attorney
General issued an opinion to all clerks of court in the State
of Louisiana, directing them to put women in the wheel, in
anticipation of January 1.
I do not, obviously, have a — did not have time to QUESTION:

What’s the selection from, a voters list

or something?
MR. VICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Primarily, or —

MR. VICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

This morning I was served with a reply to our brief
suggesting mootness, and I would like, if the Court please, to
reject those portions that Ms. Ginsburg has raised out of hand,
because she has said:

While the volunteers only provision

for female jury service is not retained in the text of the
new Constitution, nothing therein precludes continuation of
the same exemption.

7
I direct the Court's attention to the intention of
the Convention.

And, furthermore, it directs the Louisiana

Supreme Court to provide by rule for exemption of jurors,
no provision to become operative at midnight on December 31st,
1974, requires change in the existing system.
I disagree.

I think it most certainly doesD

And

the Attorney General has already taken steps in that direction,
as, indeed, the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana.
Then, on page 2, she says:

Louisiana Supreme Court

has held time and again that exemption, at issue in the
instant case, is neither irrational or discriminatory.
May it please the Court, the Supreme Court of
Louisiana was following the guidelines set down in Hoyt; and
X don't think they could do any more, or any less.
QUESTION:

General Vick, what's the practical

importance of the question of whether or not this case is
moot?

You’re going to be arguing the next case, which

involves a conviction
MR. VICK:

Well, that's —

QUESTION:

-- where the same question arise, and

where no question of mootness could possibly exist.

So what

is the practical importance?
MR. VICK:

The practical importance is to bring the

Court — to the Court's attention, pursuant to the rules of
this Court, any change

3
QUESTION*

Which X appreciate, of course.

But I

just wondered what
MR. VICK:

No, our position is whatever the Court

does, of course, is a matter for the Court.
QUESTION:

Let's say that we agree, that this

particular case was moot.

But the same issue exists in the

next case, where there can be no question of mootness.

Isn’t

that right, or am I mistaken?
MR. VICK:

That’s correct, but of course the

appellants in that case are seeking reversal of a conviction.
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:

But don’t you think — don’t you think

that the defendant in the next case could lose that case and
excluded potential women jurors could win this case?
As an equal protection matter.
MR. VICK:
QUESTION:

Sure.

me

- -

Apart from mootness, you mean?

QUESTION: Apart from mootness.
MR. VICK:
QUESTION:

That’s always a possibility.
Hell, I mean, just legally and

logically, it could happen, I take it.
MR. VICK:

Sure.

QUESTION: So it does make some difference as to
whether this case is moot or not.
MR. VICK;

The only problem --

9
QUESTION:

Because the other case may not determine

this one.
MR. VICK:

Indeed.

The only problem I have with

that, Your Honor, is that when this man was tried, Hoyt was
good law.

And I assume it still is good lav?.
Now, that's the only problem the State of Louisiana

would have.
QUESTIONs

What ground do you think the

in this

case, didn’t the Court finally settle down on the -— on
potential litigants as the ones with standing?
In the District Court?

MR. VICK;
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. VICK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And wasn't the rationale of the Court

that there was such an opportunity for bias, for biased
jurors, that the exclusion of women was unconstitutional?
MR. VICK:

Indeed, they did.

QUESTION:

Isn’t that a due process matter?

MR. VICK;

It is, indeed.

QUESTION:

Don’t most —* aren’t most due process

decisions retroactive?
MR. VICK;

Well, they have been from time to time.

Conversely, Your Honor, the facts surrounding the
conviction in the other case, I think might lend itself to a
cry of passion or prejudice, if indeed there were women on the

10

jury*

But I suppose we’ll get into that then.
QUESTIONs

But that’s — that could be a Sixth

Amendment decision, couldn’t it?
MR. VICK:

It could, indeed.

QUESTION;

Not a due process decision.

MR. VICK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, it could be a Sixth

Amendment through the due process decision.
MR. VICK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Which may be different than the due

process decision that was entered by the three-judge District
Court here.
MR. VICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, there could be a question of

standing in the appeal from the criminal conviction, could
there not, as to whether a man has standing to raise this
claim?
MR, VICK:

Well, Your Honor, I was almost prepared

to concede that, on the basis of some decisions that have
been handed down by this Court recently.

However, it is an

arguable point.
That concludes —
QUESTION:
exemptions?

In Louisiana, could the Legislature give

With the present

11

MR. VICK;

Not

QUESTION;

With the present Constitution, they

couldn’t touch it, could they?
MR» VICK:

Not under the present Constitution.

May it please Your Honor, if you will read
that is the entire purpose of taking it out of the Legis­
lature's hands.
Mr. .Ambrose Landry, who introduced the resolution,
making it reflecting v/hat it does now in the present, in the
new Constitution, was the president of the Clerks of Court
Association.

lie said, unequivocally, that he wanted to take

it out of the hands of the Legislature and put it in the hands
of the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

I mean, on the language itself, doesn’t

it preclude the Legislature?
MR. VICK;

Unequivocally.

QUESTION:

Yes, that's what I thought.

MR. VICK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Ms, Ginsburg

Very well.

12
ORAL ARGUMENT OP MS. RUTH BADER GINSBURG,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE APPELLEES
MS. GINSBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I will address, first, appellants' mootness
sugges tion.
In a judgment entered in September 1973, Louisiana
Constitution, Article VII, Section 41, and legislation enacted
pursuant to it, were declared unconstitutional by the federal
District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting
as a three-judge court.
Article VII, Section 41, precludes jury service by
women who do not file with the Clerk of the Court a written
declaration of their desire to serve.
On April 20th, 1974, while this appeal x«/as pending.
Louisiana adopted a new Constitution, to become effective at
the start of 1975.
On the basis of that development, appellants suggest
that this controversy, although not now moot, will become
moot on January 1st, 1975.
The new Constitution, as Appellants point out,
provides that all citizens who have reached the age of
majority are eligible for jury service.

It authorizes -the

Legislature to provide additional qualifications.

The

Legislature has not yet had its session, to implement the

13
constitutional provisions? and it directs the

Louisiana

Supreme Court to provide by rule for exemption.
The Draft Order on exemptions under the new
Constitution, annexed to appellants’ memorandum suggesting
mootness, is at this stage merely a proposal.

It's

interesting to note that it was drafted by Justice Tate,
who has been a consistent dissenter from the Louisiana Supreme
Court opinions upholding the jury service exemption for women.
The volunteers only scheme remains fully operative
until that system is discarded and replaced by a system that
renders women and men equally amenable to jury service —
QUESTION: Would that be true after January 1st?
MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

There's no way of knowing --

Is that the — the volunteers only,

would that continue after January 1st, until there 'was a
Supreme Court rule?
MS. GINSBURG:

Unless and until something comes

from the Supreme Court or from the Legislature, there is
nothing on which to base a change.

There is just a

constitutional provision — an absence of a constitutional
provisions where there was one before.
In Hoyt v. Florida, there was no constitutional
provision involved, there was a statute.
QUESTION:

What does *— what will the new

Constitution say about jury service, Ms, Ginsburg?

14
MS. GIMSBURGs

It will say simply — and this is

practically verbatim from the text;

All citizens who have

reached the age of majority are eligible for jury service.
Well, women are now eligible for jury service.

And then it

authorizes the Legislature to provide, and the expression is,
additional qualifications, and it directs the Louisiana Supreme
Court to provide by rule for exemptions.
QUESTION;

What if neither of those bodies act,

and you simply have the constitutional provision and nothing
else, what's the clerk of a typical District Court -MS. GINSBURG:

Likely still to follow the statute,

Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure 402, which says that you
don't put women on the list unless they register.

That

statute would still be in force, unless the Legislature acts
to —

QUESTION;

Well, wouldn't it be inconsistent with

the constitutional provision that says all persons are
eligible?
MS. GINSBURG:

All persons are eligible for jury

service —■ well, all citizens are eligible for jury service
in Louisiana now.

It isn't a question of women's ineligibility.

The question is whether they ought to be accorded an exemption
under which they are not put on the list unless they
affirmatively come in and volunteer for service.
Appellees, and the class they represent, are female

15
citizens of Louisiana.,, engaged in State court litigation in
which trial by jury is sought.
They maintain that the Louisiana jury selection
system, which effectively excludes more than half the
population eligible for jury service, impacts adversely upon
the State's adjudicatory system and denies all litigants
jury trials consistent with representative government and a
democratic society composed of men and women.

More

particularly, they assert that the Louisiana jury selection
system denies them the equal protection of the laws and due
process of law, because the system precludes any possibility
that their cases will be tried by a jury drawn from a
representative cross-section of the community.
Rather, the system assures that their peers,
members of their sex, 53 percent of the population eligible
for service are almost totally absent from the jury pool.
Appellees' standing to challenge the absence of
members of their class is evident.

Women are surely a

cognizable group within the community.

They are a readily

identifiable class, singularly constant in membership.
As litigants, women are no less entitled to maintain
a challenge of this kind than are members of a racial,
national origin or religious group.
QUESTION:
class?

And the class was xdxat, the plaintiffs'

16

MS. GINSBURG:

There were three classes in the

action, as instituted in the District Court.

Judge Rubin left

open the question of the standing of two of those classes.
He declared that the class of women litigants had standing,
and therefore it was unnecessary to decide whether the class
of women as potential jurors, or of men as potential jurors,
had standing.
QUESTION:

So that he allovred the class of women

litigants or potential women litigants?
MS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION:

Yes.

Only potential?

Just potential, none of

them are actually litigants?
MS. GINSBURG:

Oh, yes, they were.

In fact, Judge

Rubin points specifically to Jenny Lee Smith Baggett, one of
the named representatives of the class of litigants.

.She

had filed a civil damage action.
QUESTION:

Civil and/or criminal litigants?

MS. GINSBURG:

That presented a certain problem.

The difficulty of joining women who were enmeshed in the
criminal process in a civil litigation before a three-judge
court.

So our named representatives are all civil litigants,

not criminal litigants.
However, they assert the interest of women litigants
generally in both proceedings.
This Court noted in Ballard v. United States, —

17
QUESTIONj

And the claim is that they —» what is

their claimed damage?

What is their claimed injury?

MS. GINSBURG:

Well, two claims.

One, that they are

denied equal protection, as any other well-defined group would
be, by the total absence of their peers from the jury.
QUESTION; Well, I thought the new theory was that
there's very little difference between men and women, and so
wouldn't men jurors be their peers?
MS. GINSBURG;
theory.

Well, I'm not aware of that new

I subscribe, and I think most people do, to the

theory announced by one of the Justices some years ago, in
Ballard v. United States, that the two sexes are not fungible;
that the absence of either may make the jury even less
representative of the community than it would be if an
economic or racial group were excluded.
QUESTION:

What was the other injury?

You said one

was denial of equal protection to actual and potential —
MS. GINSBURG;

And the other is denial of due

process, the right of every litigant, who is subject to jury
trial, to a jury that is drawn from a representative crosssection of the community.

That is a right of all litigants,

male or female, to that jury composed of a representative
cross-section.
The difficulty for the three-judge court was this
Court's 1961

13
QUESTION:

What is the source of that?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

What is the source of that?

What provision of the Constitution do

you rely on?
QUESTION:

Due process clause,

MS, GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Well, due process, yes,

What decisions?

MS. GINSBURG:

This Court has expressed in, for

example, Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co,, 328 U„S. —
QUESTION:

That was a federal court case, wasn't

it?
MS, GINSBURG:

Yes,

But the proposition expressed

there went beyond supervision of the federal judicial system.
The Court said that the "American tradition of trial by jury,
in criminal or civil cases, necessarily contemplates an
impartial jury drawn from a cross~section of the community."
QUESTION:

Well, but the State could try these

civil cases without any jury at all, as far as any decision
in this Court is concerned, I suppose?
MS, GINSBURG:

Yes, there is — well, at least, I

should put it, even if there is no Seventh Amendment right to
jury trial in a State court, once the State does provide a
jury trial, just as once the State does provide a grand jury,
though it*s not required, then its selection and procedures

19

become subject to equal protection and due process scrutiny,
as does any other State action.
On the merits, Iloyt v, Florida upheld the statute
virtually identical to the scheme at issue here, and, indeed,
this Court has not yet explicitly reconsidered its 1880
?</^

dictum in Strater v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. at 310, that a
State may constitutionally confine jury duty to males.
After Strater but before Iloyt in 1947, in Fahy v„ New York,
332 U.S. -QUESTIONS

That's the blue ribbon,

MS. GINSBURG:

— the blue-ribbon jury was

contested, but also New York's automatic exemption of women,
the Court upheld that women only exemption, and in the
process indicated that women might be beyond the pale of the
Fourteenth Amendment,
The majority opinion in Fahy_ asserts that though
there may be no logical reason for differential treatment of
men and women for jury service purposes, the States are
constitutionally compelled to acknowledge only one aspect of
women's full membership in the political community, her
Nineteenth Amendment right to vote.
The Fahy Court was relying exclusively on the fact
that well into the Twentieth Century it was the virtually
universal practice in the United States to allow only men to
sit on juries.

20

Appellants have asserted in their Jurisdictional
Statement, and appellees agree, that this case presents an
appropriate occasion for the Court to articulate guidelines
and standards with respect to the equal amenability of women
and men to jury service, because this Court's own past
pronouncements have operated not merely to sanction women
only jury service exemptions, dubious from -the start, but
to impede change, long overdue, though a majority of States
now treat jury service as a basic civil right as well as a
fundamental civic responsibility,
QUESTION:
I understand it

Is Louisiana —• Louisiana is unique, as

from the brief, is it not?

MS. GINSBURG:

In the registration system.

There

are six other States that have one slight variant on that.
Women are placed in the jury pool, but they are exempt simply
because they are women.

And then there are several other

States that have a range of women only exemptions.
And these exemptions persist v/ell into the 1970’s,
and challenges to them are rejected summarily by both
federal and State courts.
QUESTION:

On the basis of Hoyt, I suppose?

MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, and Hoyt is precedent.
What's the present status, Ms.

Ginsburg, of the proposed equal rights amendment to the
Constitution of the United States?

Do you happen to know?

QUESTION: Thirty-three.
QUESTION:

That includes the two withdrawals —

No, no, that's a question not

QUESTION;

And you're including those two in the

No, I am not.

How many have affirmatively

MS, GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Or by the date in 1979.

MS. GINSBURG:

Yes.

And of course, as would be

expected, the States that have already ratified were States
in which the ratification campaigns were easier than the
remaining States.
QUESTION:

Yes.

I ask that because I!m reminded

that there was some discussion of that proposed amendment in
the Frontiero opinion* and it has some relevance in
MS, GINSBURG:

Yes.

Yes,

QUESTION:

"Since" or "because of"?

MS. GINSBURG:

I think it's unrelated

23
QUESTION:

You think what?

MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTIONS

Unrelated.

Oh.

MS. GINSBURG:

Well* I might say that with respect

i o{_

to the Strater dictum, and without regard to any bold
dynamic developments, that dictum is totally understandable
in its historic context.
The common law jury was composed of free and lawful
men, not women.

And Blacks tone had explained, in the Third

Volume of his Commentaries, that though the Latin word "homo"
referred to members of both sexes, the female was of course
excluded from jury service because of the defects of her sex,
*

and that pattern was accepted in the Nineteenth Century,
even early Twentieth Century United States s

Why should the

women serve on juries when they couldn't vote or hold office,
when many of them, married women, were subject to a range of
legal disabilities that drastically curtailed their scope of
activity»
Hoyt, decided just thirteen years ago, is not
susceptible to the same kind of historical interpretation, but
it may be explained on the basis of an assumption, apparently
)

indulged by the Court, that the volunteers only system might
yet yield substantial female participation.

)

The system had

been in effect in Florida only some ten years at the time Hoyt
was tried.

24
Until 1949, Florida limited jury service
exclusvaly to wen.

The three concurring Justices were unable

to say, based on the Iloyt record, that Florida failed to make
an effort to have women perform jury duty, and the majority
opinion suggests that appellant Hoyt had not ruled out other
circumstances or chance as one of the reasons for the paucity
of women jurors»
But in the instant case, it is not disputed that
the Lousiana selection system and only that system, not
other circumstances not chance, produces jury lists that
rarely include any women's names.
Based on the stipulated facts, the court below
found that Louisiana's benign dispensation, not chance,
yields jury panels that never include more than five percent
women and frequently less.
Significantly, Mr, Justice Douglas, who concurred
in Hoyt, later acknowledged that inevitably a volunteers only
system results in almost as total an exclusion as would
obtain if women were not permitted to serve at all,

counties, or parishes, I guess you call them in Louisiana?

QUESTIONs

Anywhere within the State.

MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION;

Within the State, yes.

Let's assume that by the time this case

is decided there's a new rule in Louisiana that does not
exclude women, women and men are treated exactly alike with
respect to jury duty, would this case be moot or not?
MS» GINSBURG;

By the time this case is decided,

in other words, if an exemption similar to the one attached
to the memorandum is adopted and if the Legislature doesn't
put on additional qualifications, if the list -- that's an
important thing, the implementation of it —
QUESTION;

Well, just answer my question, though;

let's assume that women and men are treated exactly alike,
under whatever new rule is adopted.
MS* GINSBURG;

Yes,

Then there is the difficulty

is not present in Taylor, that is, in

showing injury.

If that happens.

your speculation whether it will happen.

Yes,

It would be certainly

QUESTION:

Well, have you any idea, Ms. Ginsburg,

what the State plans in that regard?

Is the plan to have

the circulated Supreme Court document, and whatever the
Legislature is going to do, all accomplished before the 1st
of January?
MS, GINSBURG:

It should be accomplished before

the 1st of January, because that's when the new Constitution
goes into effect.

Whether it will be, I don't know*

I was

told that the call —

That is the plan,

Yes,

That is a draft rule, drafted

by Justice Tate, that is now circulating*
QUESTION;

What

Assume that rule becomes law*

MS* GINSBURG;
for jury exemptions.

That rule, I must say, is a model

It makes no distinction whatever

between men and women.

It permits for excuses based on

individualized circumstances.

And so that, in fact, is the

rule that appellees wish Louisiana had,
QUESTION;

Have any of your actual women litigants

had their cases tried yet?
MS. GINSBURG:

No, not — not at this time*

And you don't ask us to pass on the

MS, GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

You —

The standing of the other groups

You're supporting the decision below?

MS. GINSBURG;

Well* the decision below was to

recognize clearly the standing of one group.

The standing

of another group, I think women as potential jurors, is also
clear in Judge Rubin's opinion, at page 1114, he does find
unequivocally that women as jurors are denied equal protection*
He says, the system conspicuously fails to meet the equal
protection requirements for women as potential jurors,
Since he made that finding on the merits, it’s
difficult to understand why he left open the standing

That was not «— that was not his

make an analogy to votings

that, while all women were eligible to vote, but they must
come in and register, while the men are automatically added
to the list when they reach the age of eighteen,,

could do if they wanted to, but that additional burden, I
think, would be *—

QUESTION:

What difference does it make if you’ve

got one class and you win, will you be satisfied?
MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes, of course, I’d be delighted,

I thought so,

MS. GINSBURG:

Finally, I’d like to deal with the

purported justifications for Hoyt that are heard in Louisiana,
and in federal and State courts, passing on similar though

23

slightly less extreme exemptions»
Two points are made.

One is that it's administra-

tively convenient to exclude the women as a class? and the
other is we must be concerned with family stability.
As far as the administrative convenience of a lump
exemption over individual hardship excuse is concerned, this
Court's decisions in Reed v» Reed, 404 TJ.S., and Frontiero v.
Richardson, 411 UeS,,should be dispositive, administrative
ease is not sufficient to justify legislative resort to
a gender criterion.
With respect to insuring the care of dependents,
particularly small children, the women only exemption is
appallingly overbroad and stereotypically under-inclusive.
Overbroad because it includes the childless woman, the woman
whose children are grown, the woman who can provide, without
hardship, for the care consistent with her family’s needs
while she's away from home.
And under-inclusive, because it does not encompass
men, among them widowed fathers, husbands with incapicitated
wives, whose presence at home may be essential to the family's
we11-being.
But the total irrationality of the Louisiana
classification is demonstrated by Census data and labor
market statistics®
Focusing on the statistics for Louisiana, set out

at pages 13 and 19 of our brief, in 1970, 59 percent of
Louisiana’s total adult female population had no children
under eighteen, and of the 41 percent with children under
eighteen, 37 percent were in the labor force.
Thus, for nearly three-quarters of the population
covered by this benign dispensation, child care is not a
factor determining involvement in civic responsibilities
or in employment outside the home.
National statistics are similar*
QUESTIONS

Ms. Ginsburg, Hoyt v. Florida was

decided a little less than thirteen years ago.
MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTIONs

Yes.

And it was a unanimous Court*

MS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You seem to treat it fairly

cavalierly, talking about its purported justification and
so on.
MS. GINSBURG:

Well, I think that there are two

reasons I did not intend to be cavalier.
There was the point that — two points:

one, there

was no assurance at that time that this system would in fact
produce no women.
that.

The three concurring Justices indicated

That maybe if Florida makes a good-faith effort to

try to get women, women will serve.

Later, I think it’s

been acknowledged that, as a practical matter, a volunteers

31
only system, whether it’s offered to men or women, will lead
to virtual absence of that group from the jury people,
simply do not

most people do not volunteer for what they
I
might regard as a burdensome civic responsibility.
That was one aspect of it.
The other aspect of it was that the statistics in
Iloyt, not the same as those presented here, in addition to
the tremendous increase, even in this short period of time,
women's participation in the labor force, but the Hoyt Court
never adverted to all the unemployed women who do not have
child care responsibilities* That was another factor»
And a third factor was the concentration in Hoyt
cn the woman as potential juror* This was a benign dispensation
of favor to her, she could serve if she wanted to, but she
had no responsibility to serve.
QUESTION:
?

In that respect it was somewhat like

?

Shevin v. Kahn,

wasn't it?

MS. GIHSBURG:

Well, if I may take a cue from

Mr, Justice Brennan on that, his remark yesterday, Kahn v,
Shevin was a tax case, and the dominant theme of that opinion
is the large leeway for line-drawing permitted to the States
in making tax classifications.
But what — the focus on women jurors caused the
Court to lose sight of what should have been the principal
focus.

That action — in that action, the defendant's crime

32

was committed after an altercation, in which she claimed her
husband has insulted and humiliated her to the breaking
point, convicted of second”degree murder by an all-male jury,
she believed that women jurors might better understand her
state of mind when she picked up a baseball bat and admin­
istered the blow that led to the litigation.
The Court did not focus on denials of equal
protection and due process to Mrs. Hoyt, the focus was on
the benign nature of the classification to women as jurors
rather than the unfairness to the litigant.

And that, viewed

in that light, the overriding consideration really should not
be the burden or the benefit of jury service to prospective
jurors, but the fairness of the system to litigants.
QUESTIONi

Well, Louisiana has age limits, I

guess, doesn't it?
MS, GINSBURG:

No,

MS, GINSBURG:

A 75-year-old — no, because there

is a tremendous difference between age, which is something
that happens to all of us.
QUESTION:

Say a 75-year-old man or a woman,

MS, GINSBURG:
doesn’t change.

And sex, which is immutable and

And that’s why age classifications should

not properly be considered in the same light as classification
based on a factor like race or sex or national origin,
something that is not going to happen to everybody.

You're

put in that status at birth, and you can’t get out of it.
QUESTION:

Well, with some few exceptions.

MS. GINSBURG:

With some very few exceptions, yes.

is that excluding women means that there are unfair, biased

MS. GINSBURG:

Now, what's happened since Hoyt?

MS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION:

How, this —

This Court has acknowledged that —

To convince you that juries without

women on them are more unfair today than they were fifteen
years ago?

If it x^ere necessary to prove the

impossible standard,
QUESTION:

believe, stemming not only from Thiel but from, oh, Williams
against —
QUESTION:

Well, there wasn't in Hoyt,

MS. GINSBURG:

No, there certainly wasn’t in

Hoyt, but there have been a lot of jury cases in this Court,

the essential attributes of a jury trial, and one of the
critical attributes is that it be drawn from a representative

QUESTION*

But I suggest to you that the representa­

tive cross-section requirement is more related — more
related to equal protection than due process# in the sense
of unfairness.

Equal protection in idle sense of protecting

members of the community from exclusion from jury service.
MS* GIHSBURG:

Well# I think that it has come up in

at least three contexts*

equal protection# due process# and

then# specifically in the context of the Sixth Amendment —
QUESTION: Well# do you know of a case that says
because of their — because of the lack of a fair crosssection# just generally a fair cross-section# that you
conclude that there is an unfairness in the jury in the

result?
MS. GINSDURG:

A case in this Court?

There are

several District Court decisions*.
QUESTION:

You have a lot of them

all of them

that say you have to have a fair cross-section# but —
MS. GIHSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— it's a question of what interest

you’re talking about# that that requirement furthers.
Now# this District Judge didn’t say that the
problem here was a cross-section problem# it was a problem
of excluding women# and that it was that a jury without women
on it# trying a woman defendant# would be unfair.

37

MS* GINSBURG:

The Court, I think, said that in its

due process discussion, in the context of the cross-section
requirement.

What it did say ivas that the absence of women

makes impossible this cross-section« The cross-section is
essential to the integrity of the jury system, is inherent in
due process of law, and therefore is a safeguard for all
litigants.
That was the determination of the court below.
Similar to the position taken by Justice Marshall in Peters v,
Kiff „
I think I have used up my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I am not sure you need

any defense, Ms. Ginsburg, but your brief and argument was
much less cavalier toward Hoyt than the three judges of the
Fifth Circuit.
Mr, Vick, do you have anything further?

No, Mr. Chief Justice,
