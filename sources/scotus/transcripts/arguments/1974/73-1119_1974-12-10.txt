MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Me will hear arguments

next in 73-1119, MTM against Baxley.
Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think this case is a little different than the
one you've just heard.
In this case there was an action brought by Mr.
Jenkins, who is an Assistant City Attorney in the City of
Birmingham, in Equity Court, seeking to permanently enjoin
the maintenance of a nuisance at the Pussycat Adult Theater
and a bookstore.
The State of Alabama, unlike the State of Ohio, was
proceeding under the red-light abatement statute.

There

was no provision for a one-year closing, there was no
maximum or minimum set.

This

simply and purely going

under the red-light abatement statute.
The proof in this case, ras. adduced by Mr. Jenkins,
was that certain people who worked cor the corporation had
been convicted in the Recorder's Court, which is the first
level of court, for violation of the obscenity laws of the
City of Birmingham.

They have a City Ordinance for violation

4
of the Obscenity Laws.
There were approximately 15 cases which had been
made, most of which had been tried before the Recorder's
Court? all of which had been appealed or were in -the process
of being appealed.
Since that time, the only three cases that were
the appeal, Your Honors, goes de novo to the next court, the
Circuit Court, in which there is a jury trial on the issue
of obscenity.

And, parenthetically speaking, the only three

cases that have gone to trial all resulted in acquittals
for the defendants.

But yet it was this evidence of the

violation, alleged violation of the law before the Recorder's
Court — and, incidentally, the other 12 or so are still
pending and have not yet been tried in the Circuit Court.
Bo every —■ what we have is the evidence of
convictions at the lowest court, when appeals were allowable
in the next level, the Circuit Court.

That was the criminal

process.
What the prosecution, or what Mr. Jenkins tried to
do here was a civil proceeding, and a purely civil proceeding,
which is not ipso facto, or necessarily, ancillary to the
enforcement of the criminal laws.

Because the criminal laws

were proceeding, and the rationalewas proceeding in the State
Court.
But what he did was attempt to go in and to close up

5

the theater, because "yesterday you sold obscene books or
films you exhibited, and tomorrow you may do so»"
QUESTION:

The —•

I gather that the nuisance statutes are

in Title 7, and the obscenity statutes are in Title 14 of
the Alabama Code.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, it’s entirely different

and —
QUESTION:

But is there any provision which

interconnects the two?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

And the State of Alabama has

not interpreted its red-light abatement statute to include
or exclude —
QUESTION:

Now, why do you call it red-light

abatement, because it's broader —
MR. SMITH:

That’s the term that it was given at

the time it was originally passed, Your Honor.

It was

designed to close beer halls, saloons, pool halls, and places
of prostitution, where you punish somebody for having gone
and committed prostitution, they go back and open up again,
and open up again, and open up again, you try to close them
out of business.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;

It’s a fairly old statute, then, is it?
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Will you sort out for me what is the

relationship of MTM, Incorporated, and Mobile Bookmart?

It's

G
undoubtedly in here, but I can't —
MR. SMITH:

There is an address that has a theater,

that is operated by one corporation; there is a bookstore in
the lobby, that is operated by another corporation, much
like these GEM'department stores, where there are leased
sections in the store.
lar location.

This is what we had at this particu­

?.

Two corporations, one location? one operating the
theater, one operating the bookstore.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, did I understand you to say

a moment ago that it’s the Alat» am a Supreme Court has never
decided whether its red-light abatement statutes apply to
the theater showing this type of film —
MR. SMITH:

Has never interpreted that question,

whether or not their statute applies to theaters, adult
theaters and adult bookstores.
QUESTION:

Did you raise that argument in the Circuit

Court proceeding, the equity proceeding?
MR. SMITH:

We — in the equity proceeding, yes,

sir, that was raised; but the judge issued a temporary
restraining order.

That is all that is involved here is the

temporary restraining order, which we have placed at the
beginning of the Appendix in this case, Order upon Prayer for
Temporary Injunction,
Now, incidentally, Your Honors, ---

QUESTION;

Ibv7, wait a minute.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir?

QUESTION:

You say Order upon Prayer for Temporary

Injunction.

My understanding of the temporary restraining

order is something that’s issued ex parte, without notice —
MR. SMITH:

That’s not always true.

QUESTION:

If you — is this a temporary, what I

would call a temporary injunction, either affidavits or some
testimony at least, after notice and hearing?
MR. SMITH:
sir.

This was after..notice and hearing, yes,

Much like our, I think Rule 45 of the Federal Rules

of Civil Procedure kind of thing, where an attempt is made
to notify the other people.
Now, in the — what counsel then did on behalf of
MTM and the other plaintiff, is to file an action in Federal
Court prior to the issuance of the temporary restraining
order.

In which it asked for the convocation of a three-

judge court to determine the constitutionality of the
utilization of the red-light statute, either as written or
as applied by the prosecutor in this particular case.
There was a co-defendant or *— sorry, a co-plaintiff
separate case, entirely different, by the name of General
Corporation, which had faced the same problem in, I think,
Huntsville, Alabama.

And in that case they also vzere closed

by a court order, and the three-judge federal court joined

8

?ooth cases for the purpose of argument and disposition.
And thus the decision, in essence, applies to both sets of
cases,
Again, parenthetically speaking, we proceeded —■
we meaning the MTM and the other corporation operating the
theater and bookstore, — proceeded by filing a jurisdictional
statement and sought to seek the relief of this Court from
the denial of the injunction.
The other corporation, General Corporation, decided
to go forward in the State Courts after the three-judge court
threw them out.

When they did so, in spite of the comment

by Judge Pointer in his decision, that there is a procedure
in Alabama where you can sort of expedite your — and that's
at page A99 of the Appendix ---- he said that, "In Alabama
permanent injunctions are appealable, and temporary injunctions
may be made appealable by appropriate motions, and both types
of appeals are given expedited, preferential treatment by
statute."
Let me tell you about the preferential treatment by
statute.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Where did you say this is?
That's on A99 and A100, Your Honor,

of the Appendix» of Appellants.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Oh, yes, I see it now.
I’m quoting from Judge Pointer’s ruling.

9
QUESTION:

It's at the bottom, yes.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

And what I submit to the Court is that the co­
plaintiff, General Corporation, thereafter appealed to the
Alabama Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Now, let’s see, this is from the same

judgment that you brought directly here?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SMITH:

No, sir, it was a co-plaintiff in the

same case; it was not an appeal from the same judgment.
That was in Huntsville.
QUESTION: Well, in the District Court -MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

In the District Court.
— they combined the Huntsville case

with your case?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Separate judgments entered in each?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that’s correct.
And you brought your judgment here?

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And Huntsville did what?

MR. SMITH:

After the three-judge court denied

the injunction, they then entered an appeal in the Supreme
Court of the State of Alabama.

10

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH :
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Righto

From the —

Closing.
— closing.
In Huntsville.
Unh“hunh.

And the closing was pursuant

to a temporary or permanent injunction?
MR. SMITH:

Permanent injunction there, sir.

QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Did you ever appeal?

MR. SMITH:

No, sir, we did not.

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Had the time expired?
There is no —
I see.
We suggest there is no appeal for a

temporary injunction in the State of Alabama.

There is a ~~

you can file a separate motion to dissolve, which is a
separate proceeding; but, Your Honors, we had filed our
federal suit prior to that temporary injunction.
QUESTION : Well, tell us what happened to Huntsville
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

All right.
He did take an appeal directly from

whatever this injunction was, temporary or permanent —
MR. SMITH:

After the three-judge court said, We

deny the injunction; he then appealed tothe Supreme Court of
the State of Alabama.

And, Your Honors, that appeal was

11

argued October 15, 1974, and there is no and has been no
disposition.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

It wasn't dismissed, anyway?
The appeal?

Was not dismissed.

That was the appeal brought by General, from a final order
in their case —
QUESTION: Prom a permanent injunction, from a final
order?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Not a temporary injunction.

MR. SMITH:

That's correct.

But what I5m pointing out is that although Judge
Pointer says that these things can be given expedited,
preferential treatment by statute, the truth of the matter
is that case still has not been decided —QUESTION: Well, yours is being argued December 10th,
1974 —
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

— and it hasn’t been decided.

MR. SMITH:

But I’m only saying, sir, that one

of the reasons why the Court said, Well, maybe we ought not
deal with this question, is because there is a basis where
you can go for an appeal that is expedited and preferential.
And I’m saying that although that may be true in theory, it
is not true in fact

12
QUESTION2

Well, it may not be fact, but it

exists — I mean there is a State appellate process that is
in working order.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, and that —
Do you mean they’re waiting for us to

decide this case?
MR. SMITH:

It could be, Your Honor, but I’d say

that October 15th was the day of the argument, and that's
October 1974, and this decision by Judge Pointer liras October
1973.

So it took a whole year afterwards to give it that

"expedited, preferential treatment", is what I’m talking
about.
QUESTION:

I take it you'd be here making the same

argument if they had started a criminal case against your
client?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir, I think we have a different

prospect here.
QUESTION: Well, a different prospect, but it would
be just as slow in the State court process.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, but then we have the Younger vs.

Harris problem, which means —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, buc let's assume the three-

judge court is quite right as to the applicability of
Younger here.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I just happen to think they’re not.

13

Well, I know, but if they were, you're

QUESTION:
in trouble, I take it.
HR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Well, that's —

MR. SMITH:

We're not in trouble —

QUESTION:

— the issue we’ve got to decide here.

MR. SMITH:

We're not in trouble, sir, because we

still have that permanent injunction, which has not yet been
heard.
QUESTION:

But isn't the only question we have

here the Younger issue?
MR. SMITH:

We think that that's the primary

question, Your Honor, —
QUESTION:
tional Statement.

Primary.

I’m looking at the Jurisdic­

That's the only question that's presented.

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
But aren’t we bound, or we rarely

disagree with the lower federal courts on their characteriza­
tion of a State statute.

And here the three-judge court

said this State statute is aimed, it’s a quasi-criminal and
it's in service of the criminal law.
That's what it said, anyway, isn’t it?
MR. SMITH:

What they said, yes, sir.

14
However, of course, we disagree that it's quasi™
criminal.

Because this, unlike the —
QUESTION;

You may, but don't we usually give

great deference to the lower federal courts as to their view
of State law?
MR. SMITH;

I think it was the view that they placed

on it, Your Honor, because they took the Fifth Circuit
decision of Palaio vs. McAuliffe, and I think they misapplied
that particular case,
Because if the Court will look at that case, what
occurred there is there were independent seizures in aid of
the criminal process, which was the first step in making a
criminal case to have a trial, a criminal trial.
And counsel in that case rushed into federal court
and said this was improper, and sought to seek the aid of the
federal court.

Judge Endenfield denied that aid, because he

said this is part of the criminal process; you can vindicate
your right ultimately in the criminal process.
We cannot vindicate our right in the criminal
process, and I think that the Fifth. Circuit case is not
applicable to —• I say it's good law, but it is not applicable
to this situation, because the criminal process is going on
independent, Your Honors, of what is attempted here in this
particular case.
This Court has said that even in a criminal case,

15
in Younger — in Mitchurn vs. Foster,, referring to its
Younger vs. Harris doctrine, it talks about the fact that
even in a criminal case the Court clearly left room for
federal injunctive intervention in a pending State court
prosecution in certain exceptional circumstances, where
irreparable injury is both great and immediate, and where
the State lav; is flagrantly and patently violative cf
express

■■

constitutional provisions, or where there’s a

showing of bad faith, harassment, rather unusual circum­
stances that would call for equitable relief.
QUESTION: Well, that’s only an argument, isn’t it,
Mr. Smith, that even if the interrelation that the threejudge court found under these statutes is what the threejudge court said it was, as a matter of State lav;; you say
you’re still within the exceptions of —
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, —

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

— I hesitate to further complicate

what seems to have become rather a prolix argument here, but
are you familiar with the — probably not — but the decision
this Court announced this morning, Gonzalez?
MR, SMITH:

I had a brief moment to review it,

and I note that the Court —
QUESTION:

That case, of course, casts a substantial

16
doubt upon whether or not this appeal is properly here at
all, because this decision by the three-judge court was not
a decision on the constitutional merits, was it?
MR. SMITH:

Wo, sir, it was not, but it —

QUESTION:

It's a decision to dismiss because of

its understanding of the Fifth Circuit law and the law of
Younger v. Harris.
MR. SMITH:

Right.

But they did not say we did

before the Court in that case.

In

fact, —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Beg pardon?
.They did not say that we had no

standing to be before the Court in that case.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Well, —
That we had not raised the substantial

question.
QUESTION:
possibly expect

Well, I’m sure you're not — I wouldn’t

you to be familiar with the opinion announced

this morning, but the opinion at least raises questions of,
and suggests doubts as to whether or not the case is like
yours is directly appealable co this Court or whether it
should go to the Court of Appeals.

Since it was a decision,

an action dismissing your prayer for an injunction by the
three-judge court, on grounds short of a resolution of the
constitutional issue that you raise.

17
MR. SMITH:

Yasf sir.

The Court did say, and I point to A100 of the
Appendix, that "There is a question as to whether the
Alabama nuisance statutes here in question are 'flagrantly
and patently violative of express constitutional prohibi­
tions *."
And in this particular concept they go on to say,
"it is quite possible that the Alabama Supreme Court might
construe these statutes as inapplicable", so they express
no opinion on the particular merits of this particular case.
So we say, Your Honors, that under the decision of
Swickler vs. Koota, authored by Mr. Justice Brennan, we chose
the forum-of the federal courts.

We did so because there was

no finding — there was no order against us at that time,
so to speak, and this was, we think, a purely civil case?
putting the title on quasi-criminal I think is a misapplica­
tion of the decision of the Fifth Circuit in Palaio vs.
McAuliffe, and we feel that even if the Court agreed with
the determination interpreting the statute as being quasi­
criminal, we think that we still have demonstrated the
extraordinary circumstances; and that is to say, that the
total closing in succession •— and the point is, you can't
operate anything.

I mean, you can put in — if you. put in

C'arnal Knowledge, and Judge Barber felt that Garnal Knowledge
might have offended the law prior to this Court's decision

18

in June, he could have held the employees irx contempt and
put them in jail immediately for civil contempt, because they
had shown a movie which he later thought might possibly be
obscene.
And the theater

has been closed from May 1973 to

the present time.
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith,‘was the time sequence in this

case that first Mr. Jenkins filed his action in the Equity
Court, —
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

— then you filed your action in the

three judge district court, ■—
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
~ then the Equity Court issued the

temporary injunction?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, that's correct.

And of course

when we participated, counsel participated in the proceedings
before Judge Barber, he did so in citing, of course,
England vs. Board of Medical Examiners:

we were there because

we had to be, we do not wish to abandon the jurisdiction of
the federal court that we're trying to acquire; and tried to
promote our cause that way.
QUESTION:

Have you filed a protective appeal in

this case to the Court of Appeals?
MR. SMITH:

There is no need to, sir, nor could we.

19
QUESTION?

Well, that’s the very ultimate question

that I suggested to you,
MR. SMITH:

Because we have a temporary injunction,

there is no appeal from a temporary injunction. We must do
something affirmative, that is to say, file a motion to
dissolve it.
QUESTION: Well, you have a dismissal of your
prayer for an injunction is what you have in the three-judge
district court.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

On the Fifth Circuit opinion.
Yes.

I'm --

And have you filed a protective appeal

from that in the Court of Appeals?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we haven’t.
For your Circuit.

MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Have you moved to dissolve the State

court injunction?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir, we took the position that

under England vs, Board of Medical • Examiners, if we took that
affirmative action, we might very well be then usurped of
the jurisdiction in the federal courts..

And thus, wa can't

very well take the affirmative action in citing England vs.
Board of Medical Examiners at the same time in order to go

20

forward *
So we did not go forward that way.

For that reason,

sir.
QUESTION:

So you took no action to dissolve the

temporary injunction?
MR. SMITHS

NO, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Smith, since it’s

not likely that we’ll finish this case today, if you wish
you may file any comments or observations you have about the
applicability of ‘the Gonsales case to this case tomorrow
morning, but you won't be confined to that.

Would three

or four days be enough if you can’t do it tonight?
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

I would appreciate that, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It’s not a long opinion,

but you can file it either in the morning or later.
MR. SMITH:

I'd like to have tmtil Friday, if the

Court please.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. SMITH:

Very well.

Thank you,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Jenkins.

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OP HERBERT JENKINS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. JENKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There have been several comments made during Mr.
Smith's presentation that are misrepresentative of the
procedures that occurred in this case.

I don't know whether

— I don't believe they were intentional, but, for one thing:
The first thing they did, I filed an injunction
procedure in the Circuit Court on March the 7th to set up a
hearing for March the 13th, and gave them notice of it?
and the next day, or the morning of the hearing, their
local counsel was in the federal court securing a filing of
removal petition.

And he came to the hearing, and with the

bond or whatever, the removal order, and presented it to the
Circuit Judge, who — for some reason? I forgot the
technicality — wouldn't accept it.
But they had to go back to the court and get that
perfected.

In the meantime, he said that we're going to have

a hearing, and we had the hearing, while he was over there
getting the thing removed; so they did remove it, and I
filed a motion to remand immediately.

And we had a hearing

on that, and got the case remanded to the Circuit Court, and
proceeded to set another hearing that we were going to have.
In the meantime, they filed this present action.

22

Ifc involved — there liras already pending another case he
talked about, that is on appeal, and it was argued at the
Alabama Supreme Court, which was separate from this case,
the City of Huntsville case, and there had already been filed
another case by Earl Morgan, the District Attorney of
Jefferson County, in a separate case which involved the
Mobile Bookmart, which is a store, a book store located
downtown, across the street from the Federal Building,
This theater that I filed an injunction against is
located in the eastern section of the City of Birmingham, and
contains in the front of it a little book store, in addition
to the theater.

And that’s operated by MTM, Incorporated.

This whole title of the case got switched around.
The other party, the Huntsville case did not appeal from the
three-judge court order in this case, electing to go ahead
and perfect their appeal in the State court.
And this case was appealed.

Attorney General Baxley

was named, because he’s required to have notice in these type
actions, and Earl Morgan was named, because he is the party
upon whose relation this case was filed on behalf of the book
store downtown.
Now, that case, there was a motion to — 'they
removed that case also to the federal court, and there was a
motion filed to remand in that case, which was never ruled
upon, because this hearing, or this case was filed, and they

23
Consolidated then immediately, all three of these cases?
and on the basis of this jurisdictional question of whether
or not the federal court could intervene in the matter.
And set it down for hearing in due course,
Now, it’s very complicated,, the record is not here
before the Court as to what exactly happened, and of course,
I guess, to consider this particular narrow question of
whether the Younger vs. Harris principle applies in this
particular case, it wouldn't be necessary.
But in order that this Court might consider the
principle of Younger vs, Harris, whether or not it involves a
criminal prosecution, I would like to state that in my
complaint — he made a statement that there were some 15
cases, but, on the contrary, we began this matter when the
theater opened in September of 1970, and it went to March of
1973 when the injunction in the Circuit Court was issued.
And up till that time, they showed something like
125 to 30 movies, and which every one of them was named'in
my complaint before the Circuit Court, and it was made an
exhibit to their complaint in the federal court.

And the}/

started per dates, except for about two months when the
newspapers refused to take advertisements.
But interspersed

during that time, over the 125-30

week period we made 30 cases-, some we skipped a few weeks,
but they were interspersed between the x^hole period of time,

24
130 cases.

Some might — they might go five weeks, and some

of them less; but we did get a good sampling of them.
Some of the titles were;

Ranch Hand in the Cellar?

Sex and the Single Vampire; Gemini Peg? Early to Bed;
Class of *69; Daughters of Satan; Models for Love; Harvey
Swings; Bitter Cherry; Flesh to Flesh; I Do Everything?
Lolita's lollipop; Mind Blower; Cinder Bailer; Lovely
Housewife; and so on.
And including the ones, the 30 cases we had.
Out of those 30 cases, there were 30 convictions
in Recorder's Court, all of which were appealed to the
Circuit Court, to the Criminal Division, for trial de novo.
Out of those 30, there were 18 cases that were
tried, and there were reconvictions in every case.

There's

some — the rest of them are still pending except for three
cases that he mentioned, which did result in acquittal of
the defendant, just recently, which of course I could ex plain
to the Court, but — it's — the jury returned one verdict
in a case said that they were reluctant to find him not
guilty because of the rulings of the Supreme Court of the
United States.
Another one was that they didn't think our preMiller ordinance had the — defined to the man, to the
defendant exactly what he could or could not do, or the
specificity matter.

25
But, anyway, the matter came on to be heard before
the three-judge district court, and on the face of the bill
filed in the district court, showed that this was a criminal
matter, that was filed in accordance with the State statute
that’s been mentioned, which is in Title 7, and it does -has a different section in there, I think Mr. Clancy read it,
and it required
It sayss

A nuisance established in a criminal

action proceeding under this Article? in case the existence
of such nuisance is established in a criminal proceeding,
in the court not having equitable jurisdiction, the
solicitor or prosecuting officer shall proceed promptly
under this Article to enforce the provisions and penalties
thereof, and the findings of the defendant guilty in such
criminal proceedings, unless reversed or set aside, shall
be conclusive as against the defendant as to the existence
of the nuisance.

And so forth.

QUESTION?

Does that take a separate equitable

proceeding in that circumstance? does it?
MR. JENKINS:
QUESTIONS

Sir?
Does it take a separate equitable

proceeding to get the injunction in that —
MR. JENKINS s
QUESTION:
MR. JENKINSs

It just says that in a —
No, but —■ what's your Alabama practice?
Yes, sir, you do, you have to go

26
into the
Question•

Yes.

MR. JENKINS:

— Equity Court after you have the

conviction —
QUESTION:

Your Alabama judicial structure has a

separate Equity Court, does it?
MR. JENKINS;

Yes, sir.

Not — well, since July

of '73 we've adopted the Civil Rules of Practice, -—
QUESTION; I see.
MR. JENKINS;

— which are similar to the federal,

and now they've done away with it, but we still have a
division.
QUESTION;

That's when the judge puts on his

Equity hat, doesn't he?
MR. JENKINS;
QUESTION;

That's right.

Yes.

MR. JENKINS;

But we still keep it divided.

The Equity judges are still there, and they still handle
they automatically refer them to the Equity Division, anyway.
QUESTION;

So, in any event, the statute contemplates

a separate, independent equitable proceeding, even in the
circumstance of a conviction?
MR. JENKINS;
these —
QUESTION:

Yes

That's right.

Even after we had

27
MR. JENKINS:

—• thirty convictions, it contemplates

a separate action.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION?

Can the Equity Court or the chancellor

take some sort of notice,, or is there some sort of res
judicata effect that I gather from your reading of that
language, as a result of the criminal conviction?
MR. JENKINS:

Well, I played it safe, I introduced

certified copies of the convictions both in Recorder’s
Court and in — of those that we had convictions in the
Circuit Court, and in addition I had the Recorder’s Court
judge and the Circuit Court judge who heard all -those cases
testify.
QUESTION: Were they admitted in the equity
proceeding?
MR. JENKINS:

They were admitted, and they were

evidence and proof of the convictions.previously mentioned.
Whereupon the judge issued a temporary injunction,
not a temporary restraining order, as Mr. Smith mentioned;
and the Title 7 in the other provisions of appeal from those
types of injunction provides that within ten days of the
issuance of such an order an appeal may be taken to the State
Supreme Court.
And there is an accelerated procedure for filing
the transcript and the briefs.

28

This appeal was not taken, as X stated, this suit
was filed in the federal court ih the interim, and so no
appeal was taken from that order.
Then, upon my having applied for a permanent
injunction, they wanted to await the decision of this case
and, by agreement, we continued, and it's still being continued,
pending the outcome of this matter.
But he’s still entitled to a permanent —■ hearing
on a permanent injunction.

And, incidentally, after six

months, if no one does push for final hearing, under ordinary
circumstances, the temporary injunction will expire.
But that was by agreement, by continuing also.
QUESTIONS

But it

takes a stipulation of the

parties to the injunctive action, in order to continue the
permanent injunction beyond six months?
MR. JENKINS:
QUESTION:
MR. JENKINS:

Yes, sir.
And there was such a stipulation?
Yes, sir.

Because of the pendency of this litigation.
QUESTION:

Has nothing to do with the temporary

injunction?
MR. JENKINS:

No, sir.

They lost that, because

they only had ten days and they did not take advantage cf it.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you had ten days to

appeal the temporary injunction, but that it would expire of

29
its own force without any appeal in sir months, unless it
was stipulated that it would be continued beyond —
MR. JENKINS:

A temporary restraining order, which

was not issued in this case, would have been issued ex parte?
this was not issued.

This temporary injunction was issued

after a hearing, and based on verified complaint, which
they by-passed by skipping in order to go to the Court to
get —
QUESTION:
MR. JENKINS:

What's this six-month time that you —
Well, after the temporary injunction

is issued, and there is no appeal taken from it within ten
days, which is provided by the statute, then, after the
six months, if either party hasn’t attempted to set it down
for a final hearing on the question of whether the injunction
shall be made permanent, which is permanent until such final
hearing, then it automatically expires, if no attempt is
made to have it set down for a final hearing.
So it would not be in effect after six months.
So, in the district court, a three-judge court
was appointed, and the matter was taken under advisement as
to Younger vs. Harris principles being applicable, and we
argued there in brief that it was a quasi-criminal matter,
that it was in aid of the criminal statute, the nuisance
statute that I've mentioned, under which it was proceeded —
the procedure was instituted.

30

And the three-judge court ruled that it was, on the
basis of several things. They talked about Mitchnra vs. Foster
and said that they required the irreparable injury or the
unusual circumstances which didn't exist in this case, and
they stated that in the order that's in the Appendix, that
he referred to previously.
It stated, in fact, that this case
involve that.

did not

I think they surmised that there were ordinary

circumstances inherent in this particular type of a proceeding,
naturally a nuisance is going to involve loss of profit and
those things.
But the court deemed this to be an action in the
nature of a criminal proceeding.

Of course, the ruling that

— or reciting several Fifth Circuit cases, mainly the one
of Pules vs. Texas, 477 F.2d, in which the Fifth Circuit
told that court that applications of the principles of
Supreme Court's Younger vs. Harris decision, involving the
.

*

matter of a federal court enjoining a State court proceeding,
should not depend upon such labels as civil or criminal,
but rather should be governed by analysis of the competing
interests, that each case presents.
And so that is that the Younger principles of
equity, comity and federalism apply to federal intervention
in State civil as well as criminal proceedings, even where
the exercise of First Amendment rights is involved.

31
So the question that has been raised here several
times this afternoon,, regarding the application of Younger vs»
Harris, I think was pretty well covered in the order, by the
Pifth Circuit, and in those cases cited.

And I adopt that

argument, and I support it, and 1 think that the facts of
this case indicate that if we don’t have some kind of a
stop to people running to the federal court in these
particular instances, that we're in effect being precluded
from stopping any kind of pornography because, as indicated,
they showed these films over a two-and-a-half-year period,
and we undertook as much prosecution as we could, and they
wanted us to resort to individual prosecutions in each
case

where obscenity occurred.
Which we did.

And it's voluminous, it's tedious,

it's weary, and it’s exasperating —
QUESTION:
MR. JENKINS:

And unpleasant.
— and unpleasant.

And you cannot

I

stop pornography that way.
And if it is against the law, as the Court says,
over and over again, then I think the —■ there is some
equity and comity and federalism upholding this Court's
decision in this case.
This case was taken and instituted in the name
of the State of Alabama, on my relation in my case, and on
the relation of Earl Morgan in the other case, and I think

32

the court overlooked ray argument in that, in regard to the
fact that I think it's an action against the State of
Alabama, and one which would fit under the reasoning of
Larson vs« Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corporation case at
69 Sup0Ctc 1457, in that I did not act ultra vires, I had
the authority to do what I did.
It, in fact, says that I shall do it.

One of the

reasons we didn't do it sooner was because these cases
came up before Miller, and some of us were afraid at that
time that this Court might render an opinion making
pornography legal for consenting adults.
They operated fchxs theater with -chose — that limit.
That is.- they advertised "Fer Adults Cniv"„
And also that xf it s unconstitutional.!ty that
they are questioning in such an action, they must state that
they hate a legal right, cr legal protected right, which is
being denied by the State.
In this case, if they — if pornography is illegal,
as I believe it is, then — and the ordinance, the statute
that's involved has been held, in Eighty Drive-in Theaters vs.
taxley, and the State cases I cited a minute ago, holding
that ‘hilis — by the State of Alabama, that this is a quasicriminal matter, then it's not an unconstitutional statute,
it:s merely one that they are claiming it may have been
applied unconstitutionally.

33

And also an attempt to avoid the State forum from
deciding the issue.
So if this is a State matter, the State is not a
person under Section 1983, and they would have to jump those
two hurdles to get out from under that? so I think that we're
not really a proper party, anyway, and that we should have
been dismissed even on that ground.
But the Kenosha vs. Bruno case held —- it was a
municipality case, but it did hold that neither equity
relief nor damages would be applicable to a State or civil
division —- I mean to a municipality.

And I think that that

also includes the State county or municipality, or the
reasoning would.

And so the equity relief that they're

seeking, even though they * re not seeking damages, would be
improper against the State of Alabama.
So the Gibson vs. Berryhill case —
QUESTION s

You want us to overrule Ex Parte Young?

MR. JENKINS:
QUESTION:

Ex Parte ~ sir?
Young.

MR. JENKINS:

No, sir.

I don’t knox-? Ex Parte •—

you're not speaking about the Younger vs. Harris?
QUESTION:

No.

MR. JENKINS:

I'm not sure I'm familiar with

Ex Parte Young.
QUESTION:

I gather from your argument you might

34

not be.
MR. JENKINS;

Well, 1 read — I was just merely —

I offer that as an alternative to some extent to show that
I think that — of course, I realize that the State officials
can be sued, but I was trying to say that it was an action
against the State and not myself, and that should — could be
a consideration.
But the title of that Act is not a red-light act,
as someone

mentioned.

I did want to clarify that.

It's

— the title fof it is Abatement of Certain Nuisances.
And -they define a nuisance as a place upon which
"— as defined above, on which lewdness, assignation or
prostitution is conducted, permitted, or continued, or exists.
So it's not just that, and definition of lawdness
has been held to be synonymous, I believe, with obscenity,
and it's a word broader than assignation and prostitution.
It involves open and public indecency, and includes, I think,
obscenity.
So I think this action is properly brought, and is
a quasi"criminal matter, and the principles of Younger vs.
Harris do apply to it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Smith, we'll try to finish tonight, in spite of
what I said.

You've got about eight minutes left.

35

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. SMITHS

All right, sir.

Thank you.

I will only take about three.
The counsel referred to the decision of Eighty
Drive-in, Inc, vs. Baxley.
Circuit Court of Appeals.

This was a decision of the Fifth
It's in the brief.

468 F. 2d,

611.
In that case, the federal court, Fifth Circuit
held that the State has a right to use its nuisance .lav/,
public nuisance law, in a manner to where here there was a
drive-in theater that was showing X rated films, there were
traffic problems being created; and in that specific
instance, much like, I think, the case of Carmen Baby from
?

the State of Washington, Rafob vs. Washington,

where Mr.

Chief Justice Burger, I think, pointed out that that could
be a special problem that might be resolved by nuisance
actions.
That is not involved here. We have a theater that's
closed.
QUESTION;

That was confined to the traffic aspect,

though.
MR. SMITH;

I know, sir.

There were young people

going by, and of course the same thing v/ould be necessarily
true here.

36

So I don’t think that this decision of Eighty DriveIn, Inc., vs. Baxley

and I was referring to the Court’s

concurring opinion in there, where you talked, I believe,
about the fact that this could be — might be dealt with
as a nuisance; and I think that's what that decision holds
for, and 1 don't think it's applicable to the case here at
bar.
Secondly, I understand from counsel that there has
been no stipulation entered into by the parties, that the
Judge, on his own motion, Judge Barber, on his own motion,
has continued the hearing on any permanent injunction.
We are not going to ask for it, lest we be usurped
federal court jurisdiction.

from our

And I suppose that the prosecution

has not asked for it.
And we suggest, in final conclusion, that the
Court dismissed our case, and we feel that if they felt that
the State Supreme Court should rule on the matter, and they
abstained, then they should have retained jurisdiction under
the theory of law that this Court has espoused, including
more recently American Trial Lawyers Association vs. New Jersey
Supreme Court.
We £hink the court erred by absolutely flat out
dismissing the case, and should have retained jurisdiction.
QUESTION?

Well, doesn't England type of abstention

for a State law question mean retention of jurisdiction, but

37

Younger vs. Harris

has meant dismissal, hasn’t it?

MR, SMITH %

Yes, hut if the Court

if you will

remember the opinion of the judge, they suggested it was
a mixed bag, that in this instance we have not gotten to
our Younger vs. Harris problem, or we haven’t gotten to the
special circumstances there, because the State court could
construe the statute in a manner which would take the
federal constitutional question out of it.
And if it did that, then the special circumstances
of Younger v, Harris are not present.
So that’s why I'm saying it is relevant, and that’s
the point I was making, that I felt that under -those
circumstances then, this is not — they were not deciding
it on pure Younger grounds.

But I think under those

circumstances they should have retained jurisdiction,
even if not dismissed.
Thank Your Honors.

And may I have till Friday,

then, to respond to the Court's recent decision?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes, you may have until

Friday.
MR. SMITH:

Thank you.

[Whereupon, at 3:01 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted,]
