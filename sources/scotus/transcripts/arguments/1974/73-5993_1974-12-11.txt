MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We511 hear arguments

first this morning in 73-5993, Test against the United States.
Mr. Gerash.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER L. GERASH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Associate

Justices j
This case involves the plain meaning of the
federal Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968; and, more
specifically, with the Section 1867 (d) and (f), which deals
with the challenging compliance with selection procedures.
In essence, the issue in this case is:

Did the

federal court, trial court, err when they denied a motion
to inspect the master lists and the — rather, the master and
qualified wheel under 28 U.S.C. 1867(d), upon a timely
motion accompanied with a sworn affidavit, alleging noncompliance with the Act, in that there was a symstematic
exclusion of Spanish-surnamed persons qualified for jury
duty.
There is a subsidiary question, which I don't feel
it's necessary to reach, but it's implicit in the briefs, and
that is:

Is this form of requested relief, statutory relief

under the Act, separate from a constitutional or collateral
attack?

4
And the answer to both questions is yes.
The facts in this case are undisputed.

Prior to the

trial of a drug case, counsel filed a motion to dismiss the
indictment and a motion to inspect the jury wheels; and,
pursuant to the statute, he filed an affidavit of an
experience that he had in Boulder, Colorado, which is a
county, city and county about twenty miles from Denver.
And in

that, he had a case before the State court,

at that time the State lav; mimicked the federal Jury
Selection and Service Act, in that it utilized the voting
registration lists as a basic source list.

And the

affidavit that I filed is contained in the Appendix, page 15,
and in essence, without going through the Appendix, the
conclusion was that this group, that the Spanish-surnamed
group x^ere underrepresented by over 50 percent.
QUESTION':

Mr. Gerash, let me ask for a little help.

In this case and in others we always have — where
we always have references to people with Spanish surnames,
suppose a woman named Perez marries a man named Jones.
Now, their offspring is not a person with a Spanish
surname, if they follow our system.
MR, GERASH:

Well, relying on human nature, itfs

self-corrective, because the opposite sex does the same
thing.

And so we've statistically taken — usually take

care of that situation.

5

It cancels one another,, it's really not a problem
statistically.
QUESTION:

All right.

Question No. 2: your

motion, it seems to me, is directed to persons with Spanish
surnames and students and blacks —■ using your phrase — and
then later persons under the age of 35.

Then in your affidavit

you speak to Spanish surnames and youths under 30, students
and workers,
I wonder whether there is a little inconsistency
between the supporting affidavit and the motion?
MR. GERASH:

Well, what happened is, of course, this

Court certified the issue to be Spanish surnames, and did not
certify a age grouping or, in this case, blacks.

Of course,

in this specific case, being denied the lists, we couldn't
make any statistical analysis in the federal District Court.
But the affidavit — there was testimony by Professor Bardwell,
from the University of Denver, to the effect that these groups
were also underrepresented.

But that wasn't — of course that

■is not the issue that is before the Court.
j.he court only certified the Spanish-surnamed
cognizable group under Hernandez vs. Texas.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it, then, you're saying

cnat the inconsistency, which I believe is present between
your supporting affidavit and the motion, is irrelevant because
we're only speaking of Spanish surnames here.

6

MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

That's rights Your Honor.
And you feel, in response to my first

question, that the thing balances out.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does,
You must mean there a little bit, Mr.

Gerash, what empirical data is available to show that it
balances out?
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

Well, —
Here you're saying that there are as

many Spanish people, people of Spanish origins or Mexican
origins who marry non-Spanish names, like Jones or Peterson,
as vice versa.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

Right.

Right.

But how do we know that?

MR. GERASH:

Well, there have been some studies

made, and however the statisticians and mathematicians do
have an error of correction, and they take that into
consideration.
QUESTION:

I don't see how you could do that except

by absolute head count.
MR. GERASH:

Well, therefore it would be — it

would have been impossible in Hernandez vs. Texas, I suppose,
to come to the systematic exclusion constitutional argument.
But I don't know the — they do do that in the —
the mathematicians sometimes on cross-examination exnlain —

7
QUESTION:

But mathematics doesn't have much of a

play in the marriage problems, does it?
MR. GERASH:

Well, no, —

QUESTION: They don’t marry on a mathematical
basis.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

The ■—

Well, it’s mathematical to this extent:

that as many men marry women as women marry men.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

That’s right; that’s correct.
But what does that have to do with

their antecedents, ethnic antecedents?
MR. GERASH:

Well, the U. S. Census met with that

problem also, and I quote a U. S. Census finding of the
voting characteristics of persons in the 1968 election.
And naturally, when they make their random sampling, and they
go into the homes and count heads, they actually inquire of
national intermarriage, and their statistics are balanced
accordingly in their Census figures.
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:

But it is a sampling only?
Yes, but it's projected over —

projected over statistically hundreds of thousands of persons.
It’s a pretty good figure.
Of course, the amicus brief indicates that SpanishAmericans have been underrepresented even in our Census
figures.

So, theoretically,

8

QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

In other words# many of them were missed.
That's correct.
Yes.

MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

Now# —
The same was true with Negroes and other

ethnic groups# was that not true?
MR. GERASH:

That's correct.

And it — however#

since blacks# Negroes have Anglo names# it's sometimes very
difficult for a poor person to do — to look at 8#000 names,
unless their race is designated in the registration procedure,
which it is now under the new Act, and I feel we have a
very good Act, and we have a very good self-executing Act# and
I'd like to deal with that.
Anyhow# the affidavit appears, on its face, to be
okay.

In fact, my brother Patton indicates that he's never

seen a better affidavit# and I have to emphasize that this was
a threshold problem.
In other words, we never got a hearing.

We never

had a determination as to whether or not there was a noncompliance with the Act.

We were denied the list outright.

And Judge Arraj is an excellent judge, excellent trial judge#
I've tried many cases before him# but he stated this, on page
24 of the Appendix:
"Well, that's later, but I want to look at the
qualified jury list in order to have a hearing.

In other

9
words, I want a hearing."
"You're not going to have a hearing in this case.
If you want to look at the jury list some time, we will hire
6-

some extra help and if you come down, you can peek at it
all you want to, but it's not going to be had in this case.
I haye told you that we concede that the percentage of jurors
that are black or Spanish in surname are not a pro rata
percentage that those groups bear to the total population.
We concede that."
"All right."
"That's on the record."
"Mr. Gerash:

My position is, though, if I can show

it is so overwhelming, it is a violation of due process,
and I can't do it.

I have nothing to go up to the Tenth

Circuit on if I lose this case to show that it is substantial."
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:
MR. GERASII:

What page are you reading from?
Page 24.
Of the —
Appendix.
-— Appendix*
And the court never ruled on the

sufficiency of the affidavit, and there is no record on
review.

And we had no hearing.

And, fortunately, or

unfortunately, the defendant as convicted of illegal drug
dispensing, and we are here.

10

The plain meaning of the words — in other words,
the words mean what they say.

In the Appendix of — in our

brief is laid out the statute that has a Declaration of
Policy.
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:

What page?
Page la, which would be page 50 of

Petitioner’s Brief.
The Declaration of Policy of the United States is
declared to have a random cross-section of the community,
and that there should not be any dispute —■ that all jurors
should be able to serve, regardless of race, color, religion,
sex, national origin, or economic status.
In fact, prior to the Act, one year prior to the Act,
the court, Fifth Circuit, speaking through Rabinowitz, put the
key man in his coffin, and this Act buried the coffin —
buried the key man in the coffin.
And it was very salutory.

One cannot help being

very impressed with our Legislators in drafting this Act,
and it's a good Act, and it has a self-correcting mechanism;
and that is, if the voter registration lists in a specific
geographic area do not substantially represent a crosssection, and it doesn't have to be a mirror, the court, the
Judicial Council, the Judicial Conference of the United States,
in its rule-making powers, and the Chief Judge himself can
add new lists that would broaden this mirror that is being

11
polished up.
In other words, it’s not necessary to have a
constitutional attack, the Act itself is self-purifying.
The common law lawyers, in essence, shine up the mirror;
they bevel the reflection.

And if the reflection is bad,

if the reflection doesn’t reflect a cross-section of the
community, then the court may polish up his own mirror, so
to say, by selecting other lists.

It’s a very viable Act.

It's a very vital Act.
And I feel that the democratization of the jury,
this gift given to us by the Magna Charta is very strong
now and has a — will have a very great history in the future.
QUESTION:

You're speaking now to the Jury Wheel,

not to a specific jury?
MR. GERASH:

I'm speaking about our Act, the

federal Act.
QUESTION:

Well, addressing your remarks to what

mu3t foe done with the total of names going into the Jury
Wheel, not the 12 people or 6 people who go in —
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:

Exactly.
— to the box.
Exactly.

We're not concerned with the

jury, because the jury — in fact, in this case, there were
no Chicanos that tried John Test.

However, statistically

it would be invalid to say, because if the jury doesn't have

12

two, it’s invalid.
I was attempting to get at the 8,000 names, to make
a statistically viable analysis, and I was denied that right.
Counsel agrees there was error.
However, I'd like to address myself to the fact
that we feel that this Act has to be read as a whole,
because the Act monitors statistics, the Act enables lawyers,
both the government and the defense attorneys, in 1867 on
page 9a of the Petitioner's Brief, wherein it talks about
"Challenging compliance with selection procedures.”
It clearly gives both sides to file motions seveii
days prior to trial, and it gives them — "The parties in a
case shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and copy such
records or papers at all reasonable times during the
preparation and pendency of such a motion."
The Act recognizes that this is an exclusive means
by which a person accused of a federal crime, or the Attorney
General of the United States, or a civil party may challenge
i.-

•che

any jury, in that he was not selected in conformity

with any of the provisions.
And there are many other provisions.

There are

disqualifications, there are excuses that may reflect, perhaps,
a bias in some manner.
However, the Act specifically delineates that this
shall not preclude any civil — other remedies, especially

13

constitutional attacks.
So we claim in this case that not only did we
conform literally to the statute, but we alleged a constitu­
tional dimension, that we felt that we would be able to prove
if we were allowed into the hearing room and took a look at
the statistics.
QUESTION:

The government seems, in large part,

to agree with you, doesn’t it?
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
So this is hardly — the controversy

has been considerably reduced, hasn't it, since the petition
for certiorari?
MR. GERASH:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's correct.
In fact, both parties asked that it be remanded
with instructions to allow us to look at the list, to see if
— we hope we'IX be proved wrong —
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:

Right.
However, there's a little corollary,

and that is that it seems that the Ninth Circuit and the
Second Circuit have been requiring the affidavit or the
proof, the proof, to have a constitutional dimension, which,
as I read the Act and the history of the Act, is really not
so.
QUESTION: And the government agrees with you in that

14
reading qf the Act, as I read their brief.
;

MR. GERASH:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

You don't contend that you're entitled

to a new trial if we agree with you, do you, you're just
entitled —
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

No.
— to an examination of the jury list.

MR. GERASH:

Exactly.

And if I prove that there is.

systematic exclusion, I have a right to new trial with a
fresh — with a panel that perhaps has a better statistical
pross-section.
We don't want a mirror, as Justice White indicated
in the — one of his cases.
just want a

We don't want a mirror.

We

— we want a fair cross-section, just what the

statute calls for.
And these things differ, will difference in every
community. They will differ in the South, they will differ
when people get politically apathetic, and of course we're
not even entertaining the question that could be serious
later on, and that is:

Why should voting be the criteria

of serving on a jury?
Thirty million people don't engage in the political
processes, for whatever reason.
QUESTION:
registration to vote

This is a —- this isn't voting, this is

15
MR. GERASH:

Registration — well, it's — the

Act says you could use voter registration lists or actually
the people who voted in the last election.
Of course, in Colorado, theyte purged if they don’t
vote in an election.

They don't even — they're just purged

from the list.
QUESTION:

Just have to mix one election to be

purged?
MR. GERASH:

That's right.

That's basically — I would add that the Colorado
experience, when they, when the Chief Justice supplemented
the list sua sponte, I tested in Port Morgan, in another
county, and I found it not wanting at all.

It was self-

correcting, and there was no —~ there was an adequate crosssection given the defendants, and I was very satisfied.
So I think this heralds a lot of security in a lot
of good predictions with the functioning of our federal Act.
Finally, I'd just like to indicate that the
Fifth Circuit seems to be particularly sensitive, and
particularly sophisticated in this area, and Judge Gwein,
in his article in 20 Mercer Law Reviex*/ and in his opinion
in ^

s« vs. De Alba-Conrado, indicated that there are

really two different remedies:

there'.s- the constitutional

remedy and a statutory remedy; and,

they are not exclusive,
■» ■

they may overlap.

And he also indicated.that, based upon

16
his studies, that the further democratization of the jury
has maximized the jury’s greatness and raised it to a new
height of dignity.
And I feel that common law lawyers should be
given the opportunity to improve the mirror, without throwing
it out in a constitutional attack, but working with the court
personnel and the judges in order to perfect our jury* the
federal jury system.
I'd like to save — if there's going to be any
rebuttal, I'd like to save some time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.
Very well.

Mr. Patton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. PATTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PATTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The United States finds itself in the somewhat
unusual position of agreeing with the petitioner on the only
issue which we consider to be ripe for review in this case.
That is, it is our position that there is an
unqualified right under the Jury Selection Act to inspect the
jury lists, and that the District Court's denials of
petitioner's motion to .inspect in this case was error, and
we do not believe that it can be properly characterised as
harmless.

17
We think there’s an unqualified right to inspect
the list, because the statute accords such a right.
Section 1867(f) explicitly states that the parties
shall be allowed to inspect and copy all records used in the
jury selection process, and the jury lists are of course
such records.
The legislative history confirms that the statute
means exactly what it says.
Moreover, we believe inspection of the list is
necessary to an effective utilization of the Act's challenge
procedures.
I would like to correct something Mr. Gerash said
in his argument.

I have seen better affidavits than Mr.

Gerash's affidavit.

But I do say it is unlikely that counsel

would be able to come up with a better affidavit unless he
can see the jury list.
Now, there have been occasional cases which have
indicated that the sworn statement, which is required by
1867(a),is a precondition to inspection.

But we believe,

those decisions are plainly wrong, because 1867(f) says that
you can inspect the list in preparation of a motion under
1867(a).
Now, the right of inspection does not impose an
undue administrative burden.

TheDistrict Court clerk need

only maintain a copy of the list, available for inspection.

13
And we do not think that inspection v/ill be used
for delay, because the time periods imposed by the Act
effectively preclude that*
And we do not think there is any substantial risk
that inspection will be used for tampering, because the
sheer number of names on the master and qualified list would
effectively preclude that.
We do not have a comprehensive survey of District
Courts, but based on an informal survey of the United States
Attorney, who we deal with, we believe that most District
Courts presently allow inspection.
Now, whether or not the error can be deemed harmless
in this case depends on an analysis of the Act.
If the Act is read as being directed solely at the
prevention of systematic exclusion or purposeful discrimina­
tion, then we believe the error was harmless, because the
petitioner's sola claim was that the use of registered voter
lists in Colorado gives rise to a significant underrepresenta­
tion of certain groups, primarily Mexican-Americans or persons
with Spanish surnames.
Now, as I will explain in a minute, we don't think the
Act can be read in that way, but it does have broader purposes;
but if we assume for the moment that it is directed at
systematic exclusion, the petitioner does not state such a
claim

19

The federal jury plan contemplates the use of
registered vote lists as the source for prospective jurors
and a random selection is the method.

And that system is

in sharp contrast with the jury procedures that have been
found to constitute systematic exclusion in this Court’s
decisions.
Those systems usually involve a source for jurors
that was not racially neutral, and they all involve the
subjective selection method, and they produced one of two
results:

they either produced total exclusion of a group,

such as in Morris v. Alabama, where no Negro had served on a
grand or petit jury in the memory of living witnesses; or
they produced a progressive decimation of a class at each
stage of the process, such as in Alexander v. Louisiana.
Now, systematic exclusion denies a member of the
group an opportunity to participate, and as this Court held
in

v. Kiff, it stigmatizes the class exclusion.
Voter lists do not exclude anyone, any person

qualified to vote may, simply by registering, obtain the
opportunity to be considered for jury service.
Now, the federal selection system resembles
fairly closely the Jury Selection Procedure that was at issue
in Brown v. Allen, which is reported at 443 United States
Reports, involving the Forsyth County, North Carolina, system,
and there tax lists were used as the source for prospective

20

jurors, and the names were drawn by lot.

And this Court

held there was no constitutional violation,, merely because
Negroes were underrepresented in proportion to their numbers
in the population, so long as the selection procedures were
fair.
Congress could constitutionally have made voter
lists conclusive, but they did not do so.

And in section

1863{b) of the Act, Congress provided that the voter lists
were to be supplemented whenever necessary to foster the
policies of 1861, the fair cross-section, and 1862, the
prevention of discrimination.
QUESTION:

That's what had to be done after the

voting age was changed, was it not?
MR. PATTON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, right after the

voting age was changed, the Act was amended, requiring two
things:
list.

the emptying of the wheel and refilling the master
And now provides that a person 18 years of age is

qualified for jury service.
Now, we think the party challenging the voter list
and contending that there's an obligation to supplement
bears a heavy burden, and while we believe Mr. Gerash should
be entitled to inspect the list and make his claim, we
don't think it's likely that he's going to be able to prevail.
QUESTION:

Well, is that before us — the only

thing before us is as to whether he has the right to see the

21
list; is that right?
MR. PATTON;
QUESTION:

That’s right, Mr. Justice Marshall.
And you agree that he does have the

right to see the list?
MR, PATTON :
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

Yes, sir, we do.
So what are we going through now?
Well, we believe the case ought to

be remanded to the Court of Appeals, with instructions to —
QUESTION:

You want us to write an essay on this?

That ±>oth sides agree?
MR. PATTON:

No, sir, I don't think it's necessary

— I think it might be helpful if this Court made clear —
QUESTION:

Well, you suggested that the — some­

time ago, when we took this case, that it should — that we
shouldn't take it, that it should be remanded.
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

That's right.
So you perhaps should be putting the

questions.
MR. PATTON:

Well, we're somewhat puzzled and

uncertain as to what the Court was interested in, and I —
let me bring up one thing —
QUESTION:

Well, I take it, you say that the Act

is to be construed to mean that any one can inspect the
jury lists and what's on the wheel by saying, "I may want to
file a motion”; and in order to find out if I do or not, I can

22

go on this fishing expedition in the jury records»

And you

say that's exactly what Congress contemplated.
MR. PATTON:

That's right.

And it is not an

administrative burden on the clerk, he only has to maintain a
copy of the list.

And unless you can look at the list, you

can't make a challenge to the Act.
QUESTION:

Now, does that include all the records

of individual exemptions?
MR, PATTON:

The — well, under the federal Act,

the process works basically this way:

you start with a voter

list, choose at random selection, from that you send out
questionnaires.

The questionnaires come back, and then

excuses, disqualifications and exemptions are noted on the
questionnaires.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

Okay.
The practice has been in the District

Courts to permit inspection of the questionnaires.
think that's appropriate.

And I

Because I would — we would take

the position that a party wishing to challenge the Act’s
procedures must show that not only is there a disparity, but
if he wants to go on and make a challenge based on the
qualified list, then he would have to look at the
questionnaires.
QUESTION:

Well, you say the error in this case

was that although the affidavit he presented was insufficient,

23

he should have had an opportunity to present a better one, if
he could, after inspecting the lists?
MR. PATTON;

That’s right.

That's the way the

challenge procedures were designed to work.
list.

You look at the

Based on what you find, you then do an affidavit.

And iftiie affidavit doesn't state a claim then, then you're
out of luck.
QUESTION:

But there’s no need for any sort of

prima facie showing before you have a right to inspect, in
your view?
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

In our view there is not.
There's a nonrestricted right, in

other words, to see the list —
MR. PATTON:

That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart,

we believe there is.
QUESTION:

— that's in the statute.

QUESTION:

I suppose it has to be a defendant

asking for it, it isn't just any member of the public.
MR. PATTON;

No, it has to be a defendant or the

Attorney General, or either party in a civil case.
Now, it’s not faced here, the Act does not pre­
clude constitutional challenges by other persons, but it
wouldn't govern whether there's a right to inspect the
lists in those cases.
QUESTION:

And —
Well, they existed before the Act.

24
MR. PATTON:

They existed before the Act, that’s

right.
That is the only issue in the case, and we think it
should be remanded •—
QUESTION:

I take it, then, you found nothing in

the legislative history to counter your view?
MR. PATTON:

Nothing, Mr. Justice White, except in

1966, in House debates on a previous bill that was never
enacted, a statement was made that inspection might be used
for delay or tampering.

And, as I've stated, we don't think

that’s a substantial risk.

It's most inefficient —

QUESTION:

There is a time limit, isn't there?

MU. PATTON:

There is a time limit, yes.

QUESTION:

Seven days is it?

MR. PATTON:

Seven days, and, in any event, before

the voir dire begins.
And the lists are so large that it's, at best, an
inefficient way of tampering, so that we’re not concerned
about that.
Now, we think

it should be sent back to the Court

of Appeals with instructions to remand to the District Court
for action on petitioner's motion to quash the right after
he's had an opportunity to see the list.

And we may, then,

face the question of whether there's an obligation to
supplement.

But we don't face it now.

25

QUESTION;

What's our — and if he doesn't make

his case, to re-enter the judgment?
MR. PATTON:

That’s right.

Now, as a matter of interest, I perhaps should
inform the Court of a couple of tilings that have happened
since this case has been in this Court.

I understand, but

we don’t have any hard information on it, that the State of
Colorado has, under the Uniform Jury Selection Act, which
is substantially identical to the federal Act, ordered the
supplementation of voter lists.
QUESTION;

Is that new, are you saying?

MR. PATTON;

It is — they have done it, we don't

know whether — the Supreme Court of Colorado has ordered
the voter lists be supplemented for jury selection in State
courts.

QUESTION;

Since —
«

MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

Since .this case was
— the certiorari was granted in this

case?
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

That’s right.
Unh-hunh.
Now, I understand that it took a year

to develop the supplemental sources.

And one of the things

that we're concerned about in this whole area is that if a
plan is ever found to be deficient, it’s going to be very

26

difficult, because it's not easy to develop supplemental
sources.
The Judicial Conference is working on that problem,
they are now running in selected districts some computer
projects, and that may solve the problem.

And, in addition,

the Judicial Conference has a reporting procedure in which
district courts around the country report periodically with
a statistical sample from their master lists, and that is
monitoring the way the system works.
But we don't face those difficult questions in
this case.
Unless the Court has any further questions —
QUESTION:

Well, an example of this time occurred

when the voting age was changed, it took, as I recall it,
substantially more than a year to bring that voter wheel up
to date.
So that there's bound to be a lag in it when you're
dealing with a large omitted group.
MR. PATTON:

There is going to be a lag.

Mr. Chief Justice, we haven't had a great deal of
experience under the Act, and one reason that we haven't had
the experience is that until '72 the questionnaire did not
indicate race, at least the indication of race was optional.
So that if you wanted to make a challenge -that there is
underrepresentation of racial groups, it was very difficult to

27

do.
And we may get more of those challenges.
Now, during the hearings on the bill, Professors
Kalven and Zeisel testified, and they recommended that
private parties not be allowed to enforce the supplementa­
tion requirement, that that be handled by an audit procedure
in the Act.
Their suggestions wasn't followed, and experience
may show that they were right, but at the present time we're
unable to come to that conclusion.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Patton.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Gerash?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER L. GERASH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERASH:

Just a comment on Justice White’s

mention of a fishing expedition.
No. 1, I think the sworn statement, it specifically
states that the sworn statement must have facts if true
which would constitute a substantial failure to comply with
the provision of the —
QUESTION:

But you don't have to — do you have to

file that before you get inspection?
MR. GERASH:

Yes.

QUESTION: Well, then, you say you must make out
in your sworn statement, you must have allegations in there

28

that would entitle you to relief?
MR. GERASH:

You have to — I would liken it to a

probable cause affidavit, because —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked your

colleague if that were so, and he said no»
MR. GERASH:

Well, I suppose I should be on

this side, and he should be on my side.
[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

Well, no, but — then, your affidavit

was Insufficient.
MR. GERASH:

Well, I don't think it was, because

my affidavit was —
QUESTION: Well, the government says it was, and
if that’s what this case turns on, then we do have an issue
here.

You have a disagreement between you and the government

on the sufficiency of the affidavit.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

I’m just stating that —
Isn't that right?
Not really, no.
Well, why isn't it?

You said your affidavit is sufficient; he said it
wasn't.
MR. GERASH:

He stated that it was more sufficient

than most affidavits he's ever seen.

Not the best.

I don't want to quibble, but I want to point out

29
that this —
QUESTION *

Well, then, if you say there's an issue

here before the Court, before we can remand we must pass on
the sufficiency of your affidavit.

If it was insufficient,

there's going to be no remand.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

Well, on —
That's the conclusion from what you're

just said, I would take it.
MR. GERASH:

I'll stand on the affidavit.

I think

the affidavit is sufficient.
But the lower court never passed on it.
QUESTION:

Well, no, but ~

QUESTION: .

I understood Mr. Patton to say that

your affidavit was as good, as sufficient as it could be,
without an examination of the list.
QUESTION: Well, but —
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:
the point.

Right, and I had another —
— but that isn't the point.

That isn't

You've just said that you must make outa prima

facie case in your affidavit before you’re entitled to look
at the list.
MR, GERASH:

Yes, and I think that prevents a

fishing expedition.
QUESTION: Well, how many counties does the Denver
district of the District of Colorado draw on for its jury

30

selection?
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:

About twenty counties.
Well, I would think if you have to make a

prima facie showing, making it just in Boulder County might
not be sufficient.
MR. GERASH:

It would be economically impossible.

Every criminal defendant would have to be a wealthy man.
QUESTION: Well, I think that maybe militates
against the prima facie showing argument, rather than saying
that you can make a prima facie showing by one out of twenty
counties.
MR. GERASH:

Well, then I'll have to move and

change my position —
QUESTION:

I don't know why you backed off from the

fishing trip,
MR. GERASH:

I'll have to agree with him; but the

point is, if a lawyer* swears under oath facts that if true
would be a substantial noncompliance, and he has no way of’
really proving that, other than an experience with the voter
registration lists in a county that comprises one of the
federal counties —
QUESTION:

Well, I had thought the —- maybe I should

read the Act again; I had thought the government's position
was, and that yours was, that all you needed when you wanted
to inspect was to tell the court officials that, "I'm going

31

to file a motion."
MR. GERASII:

Well, the statute doesn’t say that.

But I suppose that's his position.
QUESTION:

Well, he said — the government position

is, I thought your3 was, that 1867(f) said that you can
inspect for the purpose of preparing the motion.
MR. GERASH:

Well, as I read (d), 1867(d), the

motion must accompany — an affidavit must accompany the
motion.
QUESTION:

I agree.

It certainly must.

But 1867(f) says you can inspect in order to
prepare the motion.
MR. GERASH:
QUESTION:
MR. GERASII:

That’s correct.
Well, all right.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:40 o’clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
