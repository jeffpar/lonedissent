MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first today in Humber 73-1708, Burns against Alcala.
Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP RICHARD C. TURNER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Burns, the Commissioner of the Department of Social
Services of the State of Iowa, against Linda Alcala, Jane
Doe and Joan Roe is here on cert from the Eighth Circuit
which upheld the decision of Judge Hanson in the Southern
District of Iowa in the case of statutory construction of
''“e °°cial Welfare Act that an unborn child or a mother of
an unborn child is entitled to AFDC, Aid to Families of
Dependent Children.
It involves Titles IV and V of the Social Security
Act

passed by the 74th Congress in 1935, Title IV being __

pertaining to ADC or, later, AFDC, Title V pertaining to
maternal and child health care.
1 would iirst like quote to the Court part of the
relevant statute, 602 Title 42 of the U.S. Code, Section 602
(A)(10), which says that aid —- if a state has ADC and, of
course, a state does not have to have a program, as I

if

understand it, of aid to

dependent children, but all,

including Iowa., do — it must furnish with reasonable prompt­
ness — it says that ’’Aid to Families with Dependent Children
shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible
individuals.11
In this case, the Plaintiffs were three unmarried
pregnant women without children and otherwise qualified for
ADC.

They had no employment.

They were without any savings.

They made application for AFDC for their unborn
children.
Then, if I may state the issues which I think are
present here, first of the question is, is a pregnant woman
a mother before her child is born?
Second, is she, prior to birth, a parent within the
meaning of the statute?
If she has no obligation to support her child in
regard to diet, nutrition and things of that kind —
QUESTION;

When you say "obligation" do you mean

legal obligation?
MR. TURNER:
duty.

Yes, sir, the legal obligation or

I f she has none, King versus Smith, which pertained to

a substitute father without a legal obligation, and still
another decision of this Court which pertained to a stepfather
who had not adopted his child and was held to have no legal
obligation, was held not to be a parent.

Following that logic and then, perhaps that is
stretching logic to extremes, the mother is not a parent if
she has no duty to support the fetus,
How, Justice — Judge Pell's dissent in the case
of Wilson versus Weaver, which I believe was out of the Third
Circuit, involving cases from Illinois and Indiana, indicated
that neither a parent — neither mother or father is a parent
before birth and that even the real father has no duty to
support the unborn child before it is born.
So one of the questions here is whether, perhaps,
if a v/oman has a right to abort her child, she can be said
to have a duty to support her fetus.
But let’s assume that the pregnant woman is a
parent before birth.

Are the woman and her fetus, together,

a family?
I submit not — not in the ordinary sense of the
meaning of that word and it is families which are to be
furnished this aid with reasonable promptness.
Does a needy pregnant woman derive a right to ADC
from a fetus?

And the ultimate question, then, here before

us, is a fetus a dependent child?
Now, dependent child, in the AFDC law, is a defined
term.
In Section 606, or what would be 406 of the Act, but
606 of the United States Code, when used in this part, the

6
term "dependent child" means a needy child, one

who has been

deprived of parental support or, by reason of the death,
continued absence from the home or physical or mental
incapacity of a parent and who is living with his father,
mother, grandfather, grandmother and a whole series of
relatives — in other words, if the child is not living with
one of those relatives including the father or mother _ in
a residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as
his or their own home, then, under the statutory definition
enacted by Congress, it would appear that it is not a child.
Now, there is a far cry between a home and a womb,
it seems to me and unless the child is actually in the home,
according to all intents and purposes of the statute, it
would appear that it is not a child.
How, in 1971, for the first time — in February,
1971 — l believe this is for the first time that HEW or any
social — federal/social welfare agency actually published
a rule which made it optional for states to grant payments,
to allow payments or to make federal output, federal financial
participation is available in payments with respect to an
unborn child when the fact of pregnancy has been determined
by medical diagnosis.
That, I contend, is the first time the public ever
really realized that, the first time it was really published
for general circulation.

7
Now, there is some evidence herein — or some
indication in the briefs that in that ADC Handbook, as far
back as 1946, the Handbook, which is of limited circulation
given only to local agencies but from the Federal Government
and as far back as

1946* they recognized the state5s

optional right at its option to pay ADC for an unborn child.
And it appears that as of 197-1, according to the
Alcala case, some 18 states and the District of Columbia
made AFDC available; 34 states and territories and. juris­
dictions including Iowa did not and have not made ADC
available to an unborn child.
Now,

immediately in the 92nd Congress, I think,

upon learning for the first time of this then-published
regulation, both the House and the House Ways and Means
Committee and the Senate Finance Committee introduced
committee bills to make it clear that unborn children were
not to be considered, entitled to ADC, that they were not
dependent children.

They were to be excluded.

Nov;, much is made of the fact that those bills
did not pass and I'll get to that in a little bit.
Since 1972, when these bills did not pass, all of
these cases have arisen.

I think some 18 or I don't know

how many courts, lower district courts have decided this
and no less than six circuits have now ruled on it and the
six circuits hold five out of six that an unborn child or

8
fetus is entitled to welfare payments under the law.
The one exception is the Wisdom — the case of
Wisdom versus Morton out of the Second Circuit decided in
October, 197*}.

That case had and considered all previous

cases from all the circuits and all the lower courts, had
those available.
Since then, in December, the Fifth Circuit has
also decided this matter but this, again, in favor of the
unborn child.
Those cases arose out of Georgia and Mississippi
in Parks v. Harden.
Now, Wisdom, in October, had the benefit of the
four circuits holding the other way but Parks did not have
Wisdom — no pun intended — but Parks did not consider the
circuit court’s decision in Wisdom which, I submit, is
extremely well-reasoned.
So, in any event, the score right now for the
position that I take is three judges in Wisdom who were
unanimous that the fetus is not a child, two dissents coming
from Wilson versus Weaver — one of them — Judge Pell and
Judge Ainsworth in Parks v. Harden also dissented.
And then, of course, there were three district
court judges, two from Florida and one from Georgia who
wrote opinions.

So a total of eight judges have taken the

position that fetus is not a child and not entitled to ADC.

9
Now, what is the basis of the general holding?
I think they can be summed up into about five
different categories.
The cases holding that an unborn child is a
dependent child, first, they say that the Act is not helpful
or clear.

You can’t tell from reading the Act.
Of course, I disagree, as I’ll tell in a little

bit.
Secondly, that there is no legislative history,
that one case said that the legislative history
Absolutely, I disagree.

is opaque.

I think there is all kinds

of legislative history in 1935.
Third, they say that the HEW interpretations of
long standing are entitled to substantial weight and, of
course, they are, except for one major flaw and that is, that
the Government says and has

maintained and an amicus brief

has been filed by the Solicitor General that HEW has never
really considered that the statute entitles an unborn child

APDC.
They have allowed this as an optional thing but
beyond what they, themselves, considered the statute allowed.
QUESTION:

General Turner, as I understand it,

your opponent’s contention is that if it could be allowed
even as an option, it must be under the statutory grounds
and, therefore, it would be mandatory.

10
MR. TURNER:
true.

Oh, I — yes, sir.

I think that is

I think if an unborn child is eligible for ADC, that

it must be allowed and is mandatory and that there is no
optional about it.

X don't agree with any optional stand

at all.
QUESTION:

Then you disagree with the HEW position

that it is optional?
MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir, I do.

I agree with the HEW

position that they never have agreed that the statute —
QUESTION:

Well, do you agree with the Wisdom

holding that the regulation is invalid because the statute
does not

cover a fetus as an unborn —• as a child?
Wisdom held that the regulation was invalid,

did it not?
MR. TURNER:
regulation is invalid

Oh, yes.

I do agree that the

and I don't see how you can put a

regulation in violation of a clear case.
Nov/, these cases rely on the triad of King,
Townsend and Re mi Hard, three of your cases which say that
you can't read in — you have got to — you can't look for —
you must, there must be a clear indication of an exclusion
from the class of those eligible and there I submit that
one doesn't determine if an exclusion can be found until
eligibility has been established and I think the courts below
have seemed to miss that point and this Court indicated thata

II
in fact, in the Dublino case where it said, in those cases
it was clear that state law excluded people from APDC bene­
fits from the Social Security Act expressly provided would
be eligible.
Well, for example, in Townsend, that was the case
where the college student was held to be able to have ADC
while going to college.
terms.

The Act says he can in very clear

It is expressed in there.
The Court here goes on to say, "The Court found

no room, either in the Act’s language or legislative history
to warrant the state’s additional eligibility requirement."
Here, by contrast, the Act allows for complementary
state work incentive programs.
The Dublino case, the distinguishing case, was the
one out of New York where they allowed — they said that the
WIN Program did not preempt the state work program.
So I respectfully —
QUESTION:

Could we go back a minute here,

-Mr. Attorney General, to this option.

If, from 1940 or '50

onward and currently, the Agency considered this optional,
is it your view that this necessarily means that they did.
not read it as required under the statute?
MR. TURNER:

Well, all I can say in that regard is,

your HOnor, that in Wisdom, they found — and they cited the
Government’s briefs and here the Government has filed an

12
amicus brief to —
QUESTION:

Well;, what I am addressing myself to is

the argument that there has been an administrative interpre­
tation that this is a rather unique form of administrative
interpretation when the Agency said it was optional, by which
I take it they meant it was up to the states to just — to do
it whichever way they wanted to do it.
MR. TURNER':
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

I think that the •—

Does that necessarily, in your view,

preclude an interpretation by the Agency that the statute
required it?

At least, they said it was optional.

MR. TURNER:
more

Well, I suppose not.

It doesn’t .any

it doesn’t any more preclude that view than it does

take the opposite position.

I rely entirely on what the

Government has said in that regard.
QUESTION:

Well, the Government — the Government

thinks, perhaps, the regulation is about that regulation
because it deals with — not with whether or not the fetus is
a child but whether or not there are circumstances under which
a pregnant woman has to be cared for.
ML. TURNER:

That’s true.

That’s true.

The

Government does say that.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:
uiai'

Well, you apparently disagree with that.
Yes, sir.

I disagree with the part

it is optional but I do agree with the Government

13
that HEW has never really determined that the statute or
thought that the statute included the unborn.
QUESTION:

Well, what the Government says, as I

read them, is that the option was not based upon any under­
standing that the fetus is a child but was based only on
something in favor of needy pregnant women.
I don't follow the distinction but that is what
they make.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And I gather that the Second Circuit

thought that they couldn’t buy that reasoning either and
that they just held that the regulation was invalid.

I

can't agree with —
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

I agree with the Second Circuit.
And the Government agrees with you, too,

that, under the statute, the fetus is not a child and —
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
— but nevertheless, aid can be given,

as Mr. Justice Brennan suggests, for some reason.
MR. TURNER:

Except that there is nothing in the

statute that says that that can be done and they can’t
QUESTION:

Well, you don't really care about the

latter issue, do you?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Well, no, your Honor —
Because what you care is that Iowa

14
should not be forced to do it.
MR. TURNER:

Well, I care in the sense that I

represent the taxpayers of Iowa and they pay taxes to the
Federal Government and there is no allowance for this so in
that respect, yes, I do oare.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but is that —

MR. TURNER:

It is not the issue here.

QUESTION:

What I —

— the — it is not the issue before us.

MR. TURNER:

Perhaps not, not when it is really

boiled down to it.
QUESTION:

Of course, in Massachusetts against

Mellon about 50 years ago we decided that a state didn't have
the sort of interest on behalf of its taxpayers that enabled
it to challenge a regulation of the Federal Government.

That

doesn't prevent you, obviously, from expressing your opinion.
MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir.

Very well taken, your

Honor.
Now, what are my reasons why I think that this is
a fallacious reasoning?

I’d like to dwell on that a. minute.

First of all, a statute is to be construed according to its
plain meaning.
In the common understanding of man.,

there are

virtually hundreds, perhaps thousands of cases so holding
cited under statutes Key number 188.
mention a citation.

I — I blush

to even

And not every statute is open to

15
construction as a matter of course so you don’t even look at
the HEW rules and regulations if the statute is clear.

Those

are fundamental things.
You don’t search for ambiguities that don't exist.
Ambiguities that may be imagined by an acute and powerful
intellect in the quiet of his law office are something that
you should not look for and I think that is where those
imaginings came here that this statute is unclear.
This statute is very clear.
clear.

The pattern of it is

Just as it was clear in King when it construed what

is a parent and whether a substitute parent is a parent and
they said that it wasn't.
In ff.fog fchey looked at it, at the entire statute
and they considered various sections all through it and said
that they were all consistent with the fact that a parent had
to be one who was legally obligated to support his trial.
Judge Pell, in our brief, we mention Judge Pell’s
decision on page 9 of our brief, pointed out in his dissent
a good many various sections that Indicated the child
actually has to be living.
For example, in 142601 are the words "Care of
dependent children in their own homes."

And

now there is a

whole list of these in there.
I am not going to go through them but various
places throughout the statute cover that and Wisdom versus

16
Horton noted that a child, when you refer to a child, you
are not ever, in normal parlance, talking about a fetus and
that is why it is modified by the word "unborn" when you are
or, possibly, in ventre su mere — which means
"in the womb."
The child born — a child that has already been
born is never modified by a term like post-partum, as was
used in the Parks case, the most recent case.
You don't say — one doesn't say,

"I have three

children," but, rather, "I have two children and one on the
way.11
QUESTION:
with child."

But a woman can be said to be "great

That is a very common expression.

MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir.

I think that is true, but

that doesn’t mean, I don’t believe, that the child, in
ordinary parlance — and I think that is unordinary language
I have heard it many times but it isn’t common, at least not
in my state, in Iowa.
QUESTION:

Is It of any Interest that, in relation

to this, that the Court has held that a fetus, an embryo, is
not a legal person?
HR. TURNER:

Yes, your Honor.

I am going to get

to that, certainly, and I hope I —
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

In your own time.
— I have time here to get to that.

17
I wanted to mention, though, that there is a
legislative history and it is cited in our petition for
certiorari on page 9.
There is talk of from birth to death, from cradle
to grave and things of that kind.
Also, finally — and maybe I had best, with that
light on, skip to this — Roe v, Wade held that a child is —
or fetus is not a person.
QUESTION:

Within the meaning of the Fourteenth

Amendment.
MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir.

So I ask, how can it be held on the one hand that
an unborn child or fetus is not a person, at least until the
seventh month of pregnancy, and thus has no constitutional
rights, even the right to life, but that on the other, as it
was held in Parks v. Harden, a fetus is an eligible individual
entitled to welfare, AFDC, under a mere federal statute
designed to protect its health.
If, as Roe v. Wade holds, a state may not — by an
ant I-abort ion lav;, abridge a woman’s constitutional right to
privacy in her decision to abort her fetus, how can the
Federal Social Security Law abridge that same constitutional
right to privacy for health purposes?
As Judge Ainsworth pointed out in his dissent in
Parks, the mother of a fetus may, in consequence, draw AFDC

18
for her eligible individual and then abort it at her whim.
And there is — finally, there is an old saying,
somebody once said, ’'To be alive has become a virtue and the
mere ability to inflate the lungs entitles Citizen B to a
substantial share of the laborious earnings of Citizen A."
Are we extending this right now to those who
can't inflate their lungs?
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Attorney

General.
MR. TURNER:

I'll save the rest of my time, if

I have any.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bartels.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT BARTELS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. BARTELS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
As Mr. Turner has recognized, this case really
involves purely a question of statutory interpretation and
ultimately one question comes down to whether an unborn
child is a dependent child within the meaning of Title IV
of the Social Security Act in a particular Section, 406(A).
Now, if, as a vast majority of the lower courts have
held, an unborn child is a dependent child for purposes of
the

Act, then under this Court's prior decisions, the states

19
must make needy pregnant women eligible for APDC assistance
with respect to their unborn children.
On the other hand., if an unborn child is not a
dependent child within the meaning of the Act, then no state
may receive federal matching funds to make such APDC payments
because if an unborn child is not a dependent child, there
simply is no authority in the Social Security Act for the
Secretary of HEW to make those matching payments.
QUESTION:

So you — I take it that you agree that

the present departmental regulation is invalid in either
event.
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

It's —

It either has to — it cannot be

optional, in other words.
MR. BARTELS:

That is correct, your Honor.

It

cannot be optional.
You know, in this Court, HEW has really adopted
an entirely new position, different from one that they had
adopted before, at least one can go back a few months to
Adams versus Hueeker in the District Court in Kentucky.
Now the position of HEW is that an unborn child
is not a dependent child but, under the Secretary’s rulemaking power, under 42 USC 1302, the Secretary has a kind of
general legislative power to create whole new programs as
long as he is willing to say that in some way the new

20

assistance is related to the provisions of the Act as
drafted by Congress.
QUESTION:

Under the regulation, a state that opts

to pay a pregnant mother, how is the computation of payment
made?

As if she had a child?

As if the child had been born

or — how is it done?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, that varies from state

to state and there is nothing in the Act that requires the
states to pay any set amount of

assistance to anybody and

certainly within the confines of Dandridge versus Williams
the states would have a good deal of discretion in terms of
how much to pay.
Now, In California, for example, a woman —
QUESTION:

Well, what I am getting at, whatever

the state program may be, how is it done?

Is it done as if

the child had, in fact, been born?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, in some states an unborn

child is regarded as identical to a born child in terms of
the amount of assistance.
In California, for example, however, a woman will
receive a smaller amount of additional assistance with
regard to the unborn child on the theory that the amount of
assistance she receives for her needs is, in part, allocated
to the child so that there can be some reduction.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't there be some difficulties

2.1

with that under Townsend against Swank?

I mean, if an

unborn child is a child, can the state distinguish between
unborn children and born children for purposes of the amount
of aid?
MR. BARTELS:

Yes, your Honor, I think they could.

This Court held in Dandridge versus Williams that
the states can distinguish, if they want to, between the
first five children and the sixth.
QUESTION:

That is a constitutional holding.

Townsend against Swank rested on notions of eligibility under
the Social Security Act.
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, in terms of eligibility

for some APDC assistance the states may not distinguish
between born and unborn children but when it comes to
setting the level of benefits and the standard of need, the
states have very wide discretion under this Court’s holdings
in Jefferson and Dandridge so when we are talking about the
amount of assistance, the states can males reasonable
distinction amongst different groups of individuals in the
APDC program to reflect that they have different needs.
QUESTION:

You do not think that the existence of

the federal contribution requires a uniform treatment on
this subject throughout the United States?
MR. BARTELS:

No, your Honor.

The states have a

wide lattitude and that has been uniformly recognized by this

22
Court In terras of setting need standards.
QUESTION:

Not in this kind of a context, however,

as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested.
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

There is no — is there any case which

you rely on specifically, other than Dandridge, that you
referred to, which is pertinent?
MR. BARTELS:

Well, Jefferson versus Hackney, again

says that the states have this wide latitude in terms of
distinguishing amongst various groups within the welfare
system in terms of the amount of assistance that is paid out
again.
Where the federal eligibility standards — or
federal standards, I should say, are mandatory is when they
deal with definitional eligibility under Section 406(A) of
the Act.
QUESTION:

Supposing you win here, Mr. Bartels,

can the State of Iowa then say, well, we recognise the
Supreme Court’s decision and we are going to allow $50 a month
[? j

for each child in essar living and $1 a month for each child
that is unborn.
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I don’t think I can give

a direct answer to that except to say that the state could,
I think, make distinctions between, noxtf, $1 might not be
reasonable in terms of the amount of assistance that is

23
granted and some of the material in Addendum C to the
Respondents' brief indicates that in terms of how much an
unborn child needs by way of additional assistance as opposed
to a bom child, may not be so different so that $1 might not
be unreasonable and it would just be a question for this
Court as to whether that was so unreasonable as to be
unconstitutional.
Nothing in the Act itself would prohibit that, no.
That xtfould be an option for the states and it would be up to
the courts to decide whether that was a reasonable distinction
between —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bartels, does the statute say some­

thing about "I’easonable?"
MR. BARTELS:

No, your Honor, that would really

be a constitutional question.

The statute simply leaves to

the states —
QUESTION:

Where in the Constitution do you find

something about "reasonable?”
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

In the Constitution, your Honor?

Yes.

MR. BARTELS:
that distinctions or

In the Equal Protection Doctrine
discriminations between groups of

individuals must have a reasonable basis.
QUESTION:

Well, that is not what it says.

MR. BARTELS:

Pardon?

24
QUESTION;

That is not what the Constitution says,

is it?
MR. BARTELS:

That is not what it says directly,

your Honor, but that is what I understand to be the tradi­
tional standard of the equal protection review.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bartels, I take it that the age of

the fetus makes no difference in your submission.
MR. BARTELS:

Ho, your Honor, the Agency -— the

Bureau of Public Assistance — which was HEW’s predecessor —
decided rather early on that administratively the best point
at which to determine eligibility for an unborn child was
when conception could be proven.
The Agency could have chosen quickness or viability
or something like that, but administratively that would have
been difficult and in terms of the purposes of the Act, the
point at which conception at least could be proven is
probably the most logical point in any event because the
assistance is needed at that point in order to avoid the like
lihood of irreparable mental and physical damage during; the
post-natal period.
QUESTION:

What possible justification would viabil

ity have as a point of qualification?
MR. BARTELS:
sure.

Well, your Honor, I am not really

It seems to me that in terms of the purposes of the

Act I guess I would take a somewhat stronger position that

25
either quickness, I guess, would have the advantage of the
sort of tradition in terms of the law recognising certain
rights in children when they become quick.
QUESTION:

Well, if a fetus is a child within the

meaning of the statute, it is just as much so prior to
quickness or prior to viability as it is after, is it not?
MR. BARTELS:

Yes, your HOnor, I think that is

right, although, again, the terms of the statute are
admittedly ambiguous and there was room to interpret those
terms witnin the purposes — in light of the purposes of
the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say "admittedly,does

your opposition concede that?
MR. BARTELS:

I am saying admittedly from my point

of view, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Professor Bartels, you are familiar, of

course, with the Federal Income Tax Code.
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your HOnor.

Do you get any comfort or discomfort

from the fact that — if it is a fact — that a dependency
exemption has never been allowed for a "child" prior to
birth?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I don't think that has

much to do with this case.
QUESTION:

I gather so because you don't cite it,

26
but on the other hand, for purposes of this sub-title, I am
reading from 152 of the Code, "Tie term ?dependent* means any
of the following individuals:
taxpayer,"

A) a son or a daughter of the

do you think this is entirely of no consequence?
MR. BARTELS:

Well, your Honor, again, in inter­

preting this Act one has to look at the purposes of the AFDC
program and those purposes are very, very different from the
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
QUESTION:
bakes, at least, to

Well, the Internal Revenue Code under­
take Into account that there are some

expenses in rearing children, does it not?
MR. BARTELS: That is correct, your Honor, and —
QUESTION:

And the welfare system does the same

thing.
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your HOnor.

Well, as Mr. Justice Blackmun has

pointed out, there is a different approach in the Internal
Revenue Code and the Social Security Act.
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that in terms of

tne distinction, there are at least a couple of points.
For one thing, as an administrative matter Congress
might have decided with regard to the collection of taxes
that administratively It was better to wait until the child
was actually born and to avoid the situation, for example,
in which the child was conceived on December 3Uth and then

27
the family would get a tax exemption from the entire year.
It may also be a reflection of Congress’ judgment
in passing that code that the additional expenses for an
unborn child are somewhat less than those for a born child.
That could be reflected in this case through a smaller level
of benefits, not through cutting off eligibility all together.
The Petitioners take the view that the language of
the statute is clear.

I think if one looks at it, it

patently is not clear and I suppose the strongest evidence
lor that is that — at this stage is that the great majority
of federal judges who have passed on this have not found it
very clear.
One can cite dictionary definitions both ways.
One can cite Shakespeare as opposed to others,
/

colloquial statements going either way.

And in some they are

really not that helpful except to indicate that a"dependent
child”can reasonably be interpreted to include unborn
children and it then becomes necessary to look at the statu­
tory purposes and at long-standing HEW interpretations in
this hearing.
And that is a process that this Court has gone
through really typically in welfare cases to decide questions
of statutory interpretation.
QUESTION:

You say that HEW in some other cases

in district courts has taken a position that the statute

28
included the fetus?
MR. BARTELS:

The only other amicus

brief that I

am very familiar with by HEW is in Wilson versus Weaver.
I have a little bit of trouble understanding
exactly —
QUESTION:

What court was that?

MR. BARTELS:

That was in the District Court,

Northern District of Illinois, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BARTELS:

And that brief I

guess was also

adopted by the — in the Fifth Circuit in Parks versus Harden.
Now, that brief makes no mention whatsoever of
42 USC Section 1302 and HEVI seems to be taking the position
in Wilson versus Vie aver that the term "dependent child." is
n ot clear and when the term is not clear and subject to
differing interpretations, then the states have an option to
opt out of the broader interpretation and that is an argument
that this Court has rejected in both Townsend versus Swank
and Carlson versus Remillard and I suspect that is the reason
that HEW now has searched around for some other arguable
source of authority.
And 1302 just doesn't work.

It only gives the

Secretary the right to make rules and regulations necessary
to the efficient administration of the Act.
What they are tying to get here in this Court is a

29
right to legislate broadly in the welfare area and that is
something that specifically is reserved to Congress in
Section 1304 of 42 USC.
QUESTION:

So I gather you would agree, if the

pact as written does not bear the interpretation that the
f etus in

included as a child., then that the regulation is

invalid.
MR. BARTELS:

That is correct, your Honor.

If an

unborn child is not a dependent child within the terms of the
Act, there is simply no authority in that Act to make pay­
ments with regard to unborn children.
Nov/, this Court has recognised in the past that the
paramount purpose of APDC is the protection of dependent
children and the legislative history makes it clear that
Congress was not interested simply in children as children
but also in fostering their development as independent and
productive citizens.
Now, the evidence in this case is clear that there
is a crucial relationship between prenatal welfare and post­
natal development and, given that relationship is at least,
it doesn't make very much sense for Congress to limit
assistance to the

postnatal period because unless adequate

prenatal assistance is granted, the postnatal assistance is
very often going to be simply too little, too late and they
a.re not even going to be able to repair the damage no matter
how much assistance is granted for postnatal care.

30

QUESTION:

Are there programs developed by Congress

for prenatal care?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, the only other program

that Is specifically alined at that is Title V of the Social
Security Act.
QUESTION:

So that certainly suggests that they are

not unaware of the problem, doesn’t it?
MR. BARTELS:

Well, your Honor, I think the Title

V is significant in that it shows that Congress was aware
that prenatal care was necessary but •—
QUESTION:

But being aware of it, they have not

extended it in this Act, except by implication, is what you
are arguing.
MR. BARTELS:
that.

Well, your Honor, titfo things about

First of all, in terms of

the clarity of the language,

Title V doesn’t talk about unborn children.

It talks about

mothers and children and that Act was very early on and has
always been interpreted to include prenatal care.
Moreover, Title V Is restricted to certain health
services.

It does not extend to every jurisdiction in the

United States and it provides certain kinds of nutritional
advice, for example, but it provides no funds to follow the
nutritional advice, for example.
Nov;, Title V covers born children as well as unborn
children and so does Title IV and as the First Circuit

31
recognized in Carver versus Hooker, it is a little incongru­
ous to suppose that Congress gave both to born children
and women and unborn children just the Title V assistance, so
I think Title V, if anything, is further evidence of a
Congressional purpose to include unborn children.
Now, that Congressional purpose, I think, becomes
more clear in 1950 than it really was in 1935

=

One thing

that is not really clear from the briefs in this case is
that as of 1935, to interpret dependent child to include
unborn children only meant that the states were free

to'

provide assistance with respect to unborn children if they
so desired.
It was optional then and that was because the
entire program was optional.

The Section 406 they simply

defined a large group and the states were totally free in
terms of the Act to pick and choose groups within that
eligible group.
QUESTION:

And back in those days it was Aid to

Dependent Children, also.

It wasn’t Aid to Families with

Dependent Children.
MR. BARTELS:
needs of the caretaker

That is right, your Honor.

The

relative were only added In to the

computation in 1950.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BARTELS:

Contemporaneously with the other

32

statute that has significance here and that Is what is now
Section 402(A)(10) of the Act which states that payments
must be made to all eligible individuals.
QUESTION:

Now —

Even when it ’was Aid to Children as

distinguished from Aid to Families, the payments were always
made to the parents, were they not?
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is right, your HOnor.

So that do you read much significance

into that interpretation of the statute?
MR. BARTELS:

Mo, your Honor, I don't think — if

anything, the addition of the caretaker relative in 1950
shows some further indication of Congress’ awareness that
the needs of the mother have to be met in order that the
needs of the child have to be met which applies, I suppose,
with particular force to the unborn child but I don’t think
there is any special significance about that.
Nov;, the addition of 402(A) (10) , as this Court
has

In King and Townsend and Carle son, changed the

lelationship oetween the state and federal standards markedly.
It required now that within this large group of eligible
individuals chat the states had to pay to everybody who was
eligible.
Now, in 1946, the Bureau of Public Assistance had
officially promulgated in the Handbook of Public Assistance
Administration, a regulation which included unborn children

33
in the eligible group and the history of that regulation
and its very terms make it absolutely clear that that was a
matter of interpretation of Section 406(A) and that the
Agency was saying for purposes of this Act, an unborn child
is a dependent child.
And if HEW is implying in its brief — and I
couldn’t quite tell — that the Agency has never interpreted dependent child in that way, that simply ignores
this entire eligibility.
Now, what one has then is, in 1950, when the
mandatory eligibility provisions are enacted, the Agency
entrusted with the administration of the Act has, for
several years, in fact, earlier than 1946, declared that
unborn children are within that eligible group that Congress
now says must be given assistance by the state.
Now, that interpretation by the Bureau also has an
independent significance quite apart from the 1950 Social
Security Amendments.
This Court has held on many occasions that
administrative interpretations of statutory terms are
entitled to great weight, at least when they are consistent
with the purposes of the statute.
Now, this interpretation of dependent child to
include unborn children began at least as early as 1940 and
as Addendum H to the Respondents’ brief indicates, in fact,

34
this was a problem that was being considered really, from
the very beginning of the Social Security Act.
That interpretation, then, was made roughly
contemporaneously with the Act.

It is an interpretation of

long standing in the sense that it has arrived.
For over 30 years it survived the passage of
Section 402(A)(10) and the only reason one perhaps can't say
It still hasn’t survived is that HEW now has come in and
disavowed that history.
I think when one looks at HEW’s position it is so
tied with an absurd view of its powers under 1302 that it is
not entitled to any weight.
Moreover, there is' really no reason for the change
in the interpretation by HEW except to evade the consequences
of this Court’s holdings in Townsend and Carleson.
QUESTION:

The May, 1941 opinion, is that the first?

MR. BARTELS:
opinion, your Honor.
QUESTI Oil:

That was the first sort of official
There were —

Before that, even?

MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

What —

Pardon?

Before that, even, had the —

MR. BARTELS:

It was under consideration much

earlier than that and, in fact, after the passage of the
Social Security Act in 1935, as of September 1st, 1936,
at least five jurisdictions in the United States already

35
were paying APDC.
QUESTION:

Do we know whether this letter advice

was acted on?
MR. BARTELS:

Yes, your Honor, that was the audit

exception to the Wisconsin program was overruled and one of
them, the memoranda there, indicates that, although they
weren't going to make a formal policy, that the Wisconsin
decision would be precedent for future audits.
QUESTION:

Was the — since the addition of what­

ever it Is, the (B)(10), there cannot be options any more,
as Swank and Remillard and, I suppose, King make very clear.
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:
that regime.

That is correct, your Honor,

And apparently, HEW just doesn't like

They still wnat the states to have options.

MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Well, they seem very Insistent.

They are trying to find some kind of

authority to give it to them.
MR. BARTELS:

That is right, your Honor and I —

there simply is no authority in the Act for that kind of an
optional program.
QUESTION:

Do we have any idea who "A. D. Smith"

was In 19^1.
MR. BARTELS:

He was a general counsel to the

Bureau of Public Assistance, your HOnor.
QUESTION;

This seems to be addressed to the

36
Assistant General Counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, that is the Office of the General

Counsel of the Department it is addressed to3 I take it.
MR. BARTELS:
at this point,

Your Honor, I am not really sure

I think that in fact, between the two memos

that Mr. Smith changed jobs and became the General Counsel.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith xiras the

General Counsel to

one of the divisions or bureaus within the —
MR. BARTELS:

Yes, sir, it was the Child Welfare

Bureau, T think, he may have been General Counsel to, yes.
QUESTION;

And this letter refers to an earlier,

lengthy memorandum that he wrote.
MR. BARTELS:

What is that?

The lengthy memorandum, your Honor,

is set out for the most part in Addendum I that follows
immediately.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

A memo to Blakeslee.

That is 1939.

MR. BARTELS:

Right, and in those memos is the

very careful consideration by the Agency of the purposes
and the language of the statute in terms of this question,
the interpretation.
I would like to deal with one and perhaps two points
raised by the Petitioners because I think they may create
some confusion in this case.

37
Firsts the Petitioners make something,in the briefs
at leasts of the fact that there are alternative assistance
programs available to pregnant women

and they point pri­

marily to Iowas Code Chapter 252, which is a county relief
program.
The thing the Petitioners don’t point out is that
that program is totally discretionary on a county-by-county
basis and whether any assistance at all is given and, if so,
how much depends —
QUESTION:

Back in ’ 39s who administered this?

We had no HEW then, of course.
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, the Bureau of Public

Assistance, which I believe was a division of the Social
Security Board at that time —
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. BARTELS:

— was the administrator of the Act.

Whether any assistance is paid out under this
county program is totally discretionary with the individual
board of supervisors in the 100 counties in Iowa.
And, in fact, the assistance that is typically
paid out is not at all adequate or equivalent.

Indeed, if

it were equivalent, it is hard to see why the State of
Iowa would be here because if they could get federal
assistance for that same program, the taxpayers of the State
of Iowa would be a lot better off.

38
Pood stamps also are not a suitable alternative.
It Is clear that Congress didn't mean that to be
an alternative because they made AFDC recipients automatically
eligible for food stamp benefits and the food stamps them­
selves do not

cover adequately the needs of the pregnant

women during the prenatal period.
Secondly, I want to come back and emphasize that
the citations of cases like Jefferson versus Hackney and
Dandridge versus Williams have nothing to do with this case.
This case is only involving a question of whether
pregnant women and their unborn children are eligible for
some APDC assistance and the states are totally free to reset
the level of assistance for everybody or to make certain
kinds of reasonable distinctions within that Act.
It is only a question of eligibility and not of
amount of assistance and so when you talk about financial
strain on a state, it is just not a necessary consequence of
any decision in this case.
The statutory purpose of the Act, the 1950 Amend­
ments and long-standing HEW interpretations all make it clear
that an unborn child is a dependent child within the meaning
of the Act and therefore, Iowa must make unborn children
and their pregnant mothers eligible for assistance.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bartels, in Townsend against Swank

this is something that you were asked about earlier during

39
your argument, it was held that college students were
required to be included as eligible.

Yet I gather from

your argument that Indiana would have been perfectly free
to say, sure, include it and everybody else is going to get
$100 a month and college students are going to get $5 a
month because we think there is a rational distinction and,
in effect, just argue the same thing they argued here and
were turned down on on legislative intent.
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that — that the

states could make rational distinctions amongst groups

and

If the needs of college students were rationally arguably
less than others, then there could be a distinction made
between the two groups.
QUESTION:

only
Subject/to whatever restrictions there

may be in the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. BARTELS: Yes, your Honor.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. BARTELS: There are no restrictions apparent
in the Social Security Act in terms of the states5 ability
to make those kinds of distinctions.
QUESTION:

Well, then 402(A)(10) just means that

everyone who is eligible has got to get something.

They

can get much different amounts even though they come under
exactly the same terms that make them eligible.
MR. BARTELS:

That's right, your Honor, in

Dandridge versus Williams the children who were born into

40

the family that already has ten children are eligible and
that assistance must be paid to them but this Court held
that a rate of reduction or a flat grant top was all right
because the needs of the 11th child are, in effects lass,
because of the economies of scale within the family where
the assistance is already being received by the other
children.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney Generals

you have about three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. TURNER, ESQ.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Thank you, your Honor.
General, do you know what kind of

money you are talking about in, say, Iowa?

Is there any

idea?
MR. TURNER:
Is one case that

No, I don’t, your Honor, except there

indicated — in Georgia, I think — that

it might mean as much as $6.8 million in that state.
Now, I have never tried to figure this out.
I would point out in connection with Title V that
the Government there has — the Congress has appropriated
$350 million under Title V for services for reducing infant
mortality and otherwise promoting health of mothers and
children.
This is in Section 7 of USC.

And for services

for locating medical, surgical and corrective and other

41
services for crippled children and people like that.
Now. that ~
QUESTION:

That sounds primarily for —

MR, TURNER:
QUESTION:

Food?
Not for food or sustenance but just for

MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Prenatal care,
Prenatal care?

MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Does that include food? Rent?

QUESTION:

Rent and electricity?

MR. TURNER:

I -- that I don’t know,

your Honor.

I am not familiar enough —
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

That is very important, isn’t it?
Yes.

But prenatal care could also

include medical service, I suppose.

But $350 million would

certainly be a lot of money to spend if food and clothing
were not involved there.
QUESTION:

It is not very much if food and clothing

is included.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

Yes.
And rent.

And utilities.

Well, I again repeat that when Title

V specifically speaks to matters such as prenatal care, you
have to consider, it seems, in the light of Title IV which
does not mention anything about prenatal — now, Judge Hansen

did, in his opinion in Alcala make a slip.

He quoted one

section that specifically mentioned — he quoted that as
prenatal and what it said was "parental,1' in Section 601, if
you note.
Now, that doesn't show up in his — in the opinion
that is in this case but he was apparently laboring under
the apprehension that 601 specifically provided, in Title
IV, for prenatal care and he emphasised it in his opinion.
Then he later wrote a supplemental opinion before
it was printed that that was a typographical error.
If it was, I submit, why did he stress it?
Now, as to these letters —
QUESTION:

You wouldn't want us to disapprove

that sort of fact.
MR, TURNER:
QUESTION:

What's that, your Honor?
You wouldn't want us to forbid that

sort of a practice, would you?
MR. TURNER:

Of correcting a typographical error?

No, but to say that it played no part in his
opinion seemed to me — he stressed that in his opinion
but underscoring it.
QUESTION:

So you would, I take it, take

exception with a judicial opinion that was based on a reading
of "parental" when it turned out that the correct reading
was "prenatal."

'43
MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir, but the statute says

"parental” and not "prenatal,” clearly and the judge
recognized that,
QUESTION:

That would be more than a

typographical

misapprehension on the part of the Court, would it not?
To confuse those two?
MR. TURNER:

I can't speculate on what was in the

Court's mind when he — when that was done.
But one more point if I may, if the Court will
indulge me just a minute.
These letters that are dated June, 1940 and May,
1940 for the most part pertained to an audit that had to do
with the

State of Wisconsin's granting of this.
There is nothing -- I don't think they were in

evidence.

Now, maybe they were and I suppose the Court is

going to consider them.
I don't properly consider them a part of the record,
But they don't even show on their face ifho Peter
Kasius is, who Gertrude Gates, the Chief, is or where —
indeed, where they are from or who the people are that they
were addressed to.

Who --

QUESTION:

Was that in the record in the District

Court ?
MR. TURNER:
you Honor.

I don't believe that is in the record,

I think these letters have been simply added and

44
thrown Into the Plaintiff's brief in this case since this
case and I don't think they are properly a part of the
record herein.
QUESTION:

Well* I suppose It is true that outside

of the City of Washington and where they have no access to
Congressional Records.

We, nevertheless, resort to

Congressional Reocrds that we have here in Washington in
Interpreting federal statutes, don't we?
MR. TURNER:

I think you should properly do that

If there is a question about the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, then,

may we, if these are

relevant, may we rely on these?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

If they are relevant, maybe.

But —

You don't even know whether they are

authenticated.
MR. TURNER:

I don't, your Honor.

I have no idea

about that.
QUESTION:

Mr. General, did you see the record in

this case in the District Court?
MR. TURNER:

No, sir, I have not, not to that

extent and I can't say that for sure.
QUESTION:

So you can't say whether or not they

are in the record or not.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

I cannot, your Honor.
Well, was there »—

MR. TURNER:
Bartels.

Not absolutely but I think —
You want us to find out for you?
— I could ask Counsel, Professor

There is nothing on the face of them to indicate

what they are.
QUESTION:

You usually don’t print things in the

Appendix to a brief if they are printed in an appendix,
Joint Appendix.

If it is in the record and they think it

is relevant, they are usually printed in an Appendix.
MR, TURNER:

Yes, sir and perhaps the Court will

consider — I don’t say you shouldn't necessarily consider it.
They obviously are letters that were written but you shouldn’t
give it the weight that is accorded to a United States
Senator on the floor talking about things like from birth
to death and cradle to grave.
It doesn't reach that type of stature and there were
six years that went by before these letters, after the Act
was passed, so in a certain sense there was an administrative
decision of long standing prior to this decision.
Thank you.
