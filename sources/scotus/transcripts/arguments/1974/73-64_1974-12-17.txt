PRO CEEDIWG S
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-64, lannelli against the United States.
Mr. McLaughlin, I think you may safely proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. MCLAUGHLIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McLAUGHLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This case involves the issue of whether the
petitioners here were properly indicted for and convicted of
conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. 1953, when they were also
indicted for and convicted for the substantive violation of
18 U.S.C. 1955.
The eight petitioners here were indicted in a
multiple-count indictment, with a number of other unindicted
co-conspirators, and charged, among other things, with,
first, with conspiring to violate Section 1955, and then
charged with the substantive violation of 1955.
The petitioner lannelli was also indicted for
alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 1302 and 1341.
All of the petitioners here were convicted of both
the substantive violation of 1955 and of conspiracy.

All

were sentenced on both counts, and in this case, the case
before the Court here, each of the defendants, aside from
Mr. lannelli, was gives. *v acditional two years® probation

4
on the conspiracy conviction»
Nowf simply stated, the question before the Court
is whether the application of Wharton's Rule in this case
bars the dual conviction and dual sentencing of these
petitioners.
Wharton's Rule is not at all a new rule.

However,

of course, it was —* when it was initially applied some 125
years ago, 130 years ago, it was mostly

applied in cases
**

f

involving dueling and crimes of adultery and that sort of
thing.
Now, dueling is not a very ~
QUESTION;

It wasn't a very wide-ranging rule,

was it?
MR. McLAUGHLIN;

No.

No, Your Honor, it was not.

Dueling has somewhat fallen out of fashion, and adultery is
still being prosecuted these days.

So that it really hasn't

been applied as often as perhaps it could have been.
But I don't think Professor Wharton ever really
contemplated the congressional scheme that Congress had in
mind in Section 1955.

I think he would have felt that his

rule would have applied.
But, as you point out, Mr. Chief Justice, it was not
a widely applied rule.

But it was a sound rule, and we conten

it is a sound rule.
And the gist of the .rule is, simply, that when an

5
offense requires concerted action, or plurality of agents,
as Wharton speaks of it, then the crime of conspiracy cannot
be added to the substantive crime.
Now, in 1955 the statute clearly states that in
order to violata, be convicted, five or more persons must
act in concerts

own, conduct, finance, manage an illegal

gambling business.
The conspiracy statute, of course, requires that
two or more persons agree to do an illegal act.
Both statutes speak in terms of miniroums, not
maximums.
Now, Wharton’s Rule has never been directly applied
by this Court, but it has been adverted to in Gebardi vs.
United States, which we cite in our brief, and of course it's
been adverted to in a number of Circuit Court cases.
Now» in the application of Wharton’s Rule to 1955,
the Circuits are not in agreement, they're in conflict, and
x assume that this is one of the fundamental reasons why we’re
here.

The Solicitor General did not oppose our petition for

certiorari.
The Seventh Circuit, in United States vs. Hunter,
has held that Wharton's Rule clearly applies.
The Second Circuit, which was the first Circuit to
consider the problem, has held that it did not.
The Third Circuit followed the Second, and the

6

Fourth and the Fifth sort of want off on their own; but
also followed the Second.
Now, we feel that the reasoning in Hunter is in fact
the proper reasoning.

Because they state there that there is

no element or no ingredient in the conspiracy which is not
present in the completed crime.
And we think that that's what Wharton's Rule is
all about.
It requires a minimum of five or more persons to
awn, conduct, finance, or manage an illegal gambling
enterprise to constitute the substantive violation of 1955.
Now, we contend that when those five persons own,
conduct, manage, or finance an illegal gambling enterprise,
they are, in effect, agreeing to do so and conspiring to do
so.
Now, the government takes the position, and it in
part is proper, that if the substantive crime can be
successfully maintained by a single individual, then Wharton's
Rule in fact has no application.
And in aid of that proposition, the government cites
a hypothetical situation, at page 28 of its brief, in which it
indicates that it would be possible for a single person to be
convicted of the substantive violation of 1955, in the
situation where a single bookmaker hires ten high school
students who are deluded into thinking they're involved in a

market research product, and do not raalijse that they’re in a
bookmaking operation.
Wall, unfortunately, I don91 represent ten high
school students; and ten high school students weren't involved
in the case that brings us here.

That hypothetical situation,

as Professor Wright points out in our reply brief, might be
very interesting in a law school classroom.
real case.

But this is a

And these kinds of cases involve real people.
QUESTION?

But then the rule you're contending for,

Mr. McLaughlin, would be a fact, a case-by-case application,
rather than a flat rule one way or the other?
MR. McLAUGHLIN;
Rehnquist.

Yes, 1 think so, Mr. Justice

2 think perhaps it would have to be that way.
But I'm simply trying to point out that the

hypothetical posed by the government is just so hypothetical
that it has no basis in reality at all.
QUESTION ; Well, I took the government’s point to
be that if they could demonstrate some instances in which
Wharton’s Rule wouldn’t apply in the administration of this
statute, then it shouldn't apply at all.
MR. McLAUGHLIN; Well, I think that's the position
they take.

But the position we take is that they would have

to demonstrate some practical, possible hypothetical.
In point of actual practice, any bookmaker who
employed ten high school students as an aid to — or in an

s
effort to operate a gambling business, probably wouldn’t even
be mentally competent to stand trial,
QUESTION?

Now, to convert that into some dangerous

drugs, you might have a more commercially feasible illustra­
tion, might you not?
MR, McLAUGHLXNs

Yes, well now — traditionally

now, for instance, in the drug cases, Wharton's Rule does not
apply, because a single person can clearly be involved in the
sale of drugs or, you know, transfer of drugs.
But here the statute specifically requires a minimum
of five.
Nov/, we just say that the hypothetical posed by the
government is so unreal that it's not demonstrating an
instance v/here a single person could do it.
The actual, practical fact of the matter is that a
single person can't do it.

And there has never been a single

case brought under 1955, and there have bean many, many cases
brought under 1955 where a single person was charged with the
substantive offense.
Throughout the government’s argument, and this of
course is a twofold argument?

one, we contend that Wharton's

Rule in fact does apply, and it applies in two ways in this
case:
One, it bars dual punishment? and, two, it in fact
requires a new trial in this case.

Now, throughout the government's argument there is
almost implicit in their argument and in their brief, a tacit
admission that probably there is something wrong about the
concept of dual punishment in this area. And they keep saying,
Well, if Wharton's Rule applies, then of course it only bars
dual punishment.
And I think the government senses, as certainly we
do, that there is something definitely offensive about the
concept of dual punishment in this area.
I think perhaps even more graphically —
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, Mr, McLaughlin, the

government says they made that a constitutional source,
1 don't see that — you haven’t suggested that Wharton's
Rule has a constitutional source; the government seems to feel
it does.
MR. MCLAUGHLIN:
no,

Now, I haven’t suggested that,

I -—
QUESTION.?

A double jeopardy source.

MR. MCLAUGHLIN:
QUESTION':

It verges on that.

You don’t argue with that?

'MR. McLAUGHLIN:

No.

I don't think I have to go

that far.
QUESTION:

What are you doing?

Asking us to apply

Wharton's Rule just as a matter of supervisory authority, or
what?

10
MR. McLAUGHLIM:

Well, yes.

And as a matter of

there is a conflict in the Circuits, and the Solicitor General
recognizes this conflict, and recognized in his memorandum in
respone to our petition that the problem is a recurring one,
and is of considerable importance.
And it is of great importance because even more
graphically than in our case, the problem of dual punishment
is demonstrated in the case of Grosso vs. United States, at
73-1412, which petition is here in this Court and is being
held pending the action of the Court in this case.

I happen

to be counsel in that case, too.
And in that case the defendants were given the
maximum sentences — the one defendant was given a maximum
sentence, consecutive sentences, for the conspiracy and the
substantive crime.

And fines.

So that in that petition it's

very graphically demonstrated that you can end up with

ten

years instead of five.

>

Mow, as I say, I think the government almost concedes
that there is something offensive about this idea of dual
punishment, but they take the position, of course, that there
is no — in this case, no new trial should be required, because
the Court can simply just straighten everything out by
straightening out the concept of the punishment.
QUESTION:

Is it your contention, Mr. McLaughlin,

that charges of conspiracy and of the substantive offense cannot

11
be brought, or that the jury must be instructed that they
cannot find guilt of both,
MR. McLAUGHLIN;

even if they are brought?
It is not our position that they

cannot be brought, because in this particular case, in
lannelli, there were two other substantive offenses charged,
and the conspiracy related —
QUESTION:

Covered those, too.

MR. McLAUGHLIN:

•— to those as well.

So it would have been clearly improper for the
District Court, even though we ask him to do so — and
perhaps we improperly ask him to do so — but he was not
that easily misled.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. McLAUGHLIN;

He refused to do so prior to trial,

because he said it was untimely.
It’s our position that if the conspiracy, if
Wharton's Rule applies, and conspiracy is not a punishable
offense, then it should not be submitted to the jury if that's
all there is is

the conspiracy and the 1955.

QUESTION; Well, I'm not sure I follow you.

You

do concede, as. I understand your answer now — and you tell
me if I'm wrong -— that a person, or necessarily two or more
persons, can be charged with conspiracy as well as with the
commission of the substantive offense at the same trial*
But ‘tliat the jury must be instructed that they cannot find

12

them guilty of both? is that it?
MR. McLAUGHLIN:

I don’t think the jury should be

instructed on conspiracy at all.

I think it — at the point

when the government rested and the case is ready for charge,
if the Court has determined that the plaintiffs are not
entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal, he should not
submit the conspiracy to the jury at all; h© should just
submit the substantive offense.
QUESTION:

You could have, of course, just the

conspiracy case, in the case where the gambling operation was
never in fact set up.

You could have a conspiracy plus an

overt act, and —
MR. MCLAUGHLIN:
QUESTION:

That's possible.

but frustration of the object of the

conspiracy, for one reason or another, and you could have
people guilty of conspiracy.
MR. McLAUGHLINs

That's right.

But the Court can

make that determination at that time, I think, and he doesn't
have to submit it.
What we’re objecting to, and the reason we think that
we're entitled to a new trial, is that if you can't mete out
dual punishment for the conspiracy, then why is the jury
parmicced to consider that you may have committed two crimes
when in fact only one is punishable?
So it's giving the government two targets, when they

13

should only have one.
QUESTION;

Well, I still don’t know that I under­

stand the answer to my question? and maybe my question isn't
clear.

But as I understand your answer, you do not contend

that the prosecution cannot charge these people with both the
conpiracy and with the substantive offense.
MR. MCLAUGHLIN:
QUESTION;

You concede that?

MR. McLAUGHLIN;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

That’s correct, Justice Stewart.

All right.

Then let's assume that the

proof at the trial shows that there was a conspiracy, and
that there was a commission of the substantive offense by
the five or more —— because five or more people were engaged
in it.
I don't mean that's — and there's evidence in
rebuttal of that.

And so there is enough to go to the jury.

Now, does the trial judge have any duty, in your
submission, to instruct the jury that they may not find the
defendants guilty of both?
MR. MCLAUGHLIN;

. Yes. that's — that's at a

minimum,
QUESTION:

Well, what is your — I don't --

MR. McLAUGHLIN:

Frankly, I don't — if he has

determined that there is sufficient evidence *—
QUESTION;

Of both

14
MR. MCLAUGHLINs

Of both.

Then I do not think that

he should submit both to the jury.
QUESTION; Well, which on© must he eliminate?
MR. McLAUGHLIM;

I would think that he would submit

the substantive offense, because it carries the more grievous
penalty.
QUESTION;

Well, that's not a very defendant-minded

answer.
MR. MCLAUGHLIN:

No, it's not.

But I think that

that's probably a more palatable choice for the District
Court, because I think that they probably would feel that the
more serious charge would be the one that should be
submitted.
QUESTION:

Well, conspiracy is a pretty serious charge;.

Generally — often it has been considered to be more serious
than the substantive offense.
MR. MCLAUGHLIN;

Right.

QUESTION: The Court has often said so.
MR. McLAUGHLXN:

But in terms of penalty, Congress

has e3.ected to make the substantive offense the more serious
crime.
QUESTION: Well, then, would you try —• would you
answer my question.

It's the duty of the trial judge in his

instructions to the jury, assuming people charged with both
conspiracy and with the substantive offense, assume sufficient

15
evidence of both to go to the jury, now what is the trial
court’s — trial judge’s duty, under your submission under
'r

the Wharton Rule, as to his instructions to. the jury?
MR. MCLAUGHLIN:
QUESTIGN:

Well ~

Or is it his duty to dismiss at the

end of the prosecution’s evidence, on one or both of the
charges?
MR. McLAUGHLIN;
QUESTION:

So, which one?

MR. McLAUGHLIN:
QUESTION:

We feel it is hist duty to —

~ to dismiss the conspiracy.

Why?

MR. McLAUGHLIN:

Because the conspiracy is an

integral part of the substantive offense.
Without the conspiracy, the substantive — the
substantive offense requires a conspiracy.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the conspiracy doesn’t always

result in a substantive offense.
And the jury may — might or might not reject the
incriminating evidence with respect to the substantive
offense.

It might hold, if both went to the jury, that there

was a conspiracy but that there was not a substantive offense.
And shouldn’t a jury' be free to so hold?
MR. McLAUGHLIN:

Well, perhaps the

QUESTION: .Shouldn't both, therefore, go to the jury?
MR. McLAUGHLIN:

Then perhaps maybe they should,

16
Mr. Justice Stewart.

But at that point,, then, the Court

should clearly instruct the jury that they can't find them
guilty of both.
Now, in this case, of course, the jury was instructed
just the opposite.
QUESTION s

Unh-hunh.

Well, I didn't know if that was your position, or if
it was your position that in the event there were a finding of
guilt as to both, then it became incumbent upon the District
Judge to do something about it.
MR. McLAUGHLIN;

No, as a matter of fact, I think

that's totally the wrong approach to what you proposed last.
QUESTION;

Well, that's what I'm trying to get at;

what is your position?
MR. McLAUGHLIN;

I think — I think he has to cure

the matter by his charge, the minimum, before it goes to the
jury, but not wait until afterwards,
QUESTION:

And say what, by his charge?

MR. McLAUGHLIN:

That they may not find the

defendants guilty of both offenses.
If you're going to give them the election — if
you're going to submit both the conspiracy and the substantive
offense, I think he should charge then that if they find the
defendants guilty of the substantive offense, they should not
consider the conspiracy.

Or should find him not guilty of the

17
conspiracy»
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

And the instructions should

be that way, rather than that you can't find him guilty of
both?

You'd have to says

if you find him guilty of the

substantive offense, then you must — what?

Find him not

guilty of the conspiracy?
MR. MCLAUGHLINS
QUESTIONS

Not guilty.

Or not consider the conspiracy?

MR. McLAUGHLINs

Or not consider it.

It really would be foolish to have them consider it,
only to find them not guilty.
I think just not consider at all.
QUESTIONS

Unh-hunh.

And only ~ would the

instruction be only if you find him not guilty of the
substantive offense are you permitted to consider the
conspiracy charge?

Would that be the instruction, in your

submission?
MR. McLAUGHLINs

Yes.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart,

I believait would, or that it would.
But if I had my druthers, I'd rather the District
Court males —
QUESTIONS

Well, I want to know what your

submission is here, that's all.
MR. McLAUGHLINs Well, what you said is correct, you
understand it.

IS
We

understand each other.

QUESTION :

Unh-huh.

QUESTION?

On your thesis, ten man, or ten men

and women, could not engage in conspiracy and then have it
develop that only five of them were participants in the
substantive offense, the two, you said, are all bound
together, you can't separate them?
MR. MCLAUGHLIN?
•

Well, yes, they are bound together,

*

I can't really conceive of a practical situation — I can't
conceive of any practical situation where the question you
pose

would occur in a gambling —
QUESTION?

Well, then what you're saying here is

that there can’t be any offense of conspiracy, to commit the
offense?
MR. McLAUGHLIN;

I guess that's really what I’m

saying —
QUESTION?

It must be consummated in order to have

any criminal act.
MR. McLAUGHLIN?

That's right, because the statute

requires the five or more people actually be an operation.
In other words, they can't be prosecuted unless they have
gotten the 1hing off the ground.

The statute doesn’t speak in

terms of theoretical gambling operations, it speaks of
actual ones that have attained a certain plateau of economic
success, and have operated for thirty days or more.

19

So that the conspiracy is complete when you have
enough to lay the substantive charge.
You see, under the government's theory they sort of
think that these people sort of drift into these things.
Gambling enterprises don't operate by drafting employees.
only have voluntary enlistments.

They

And the people that enlist

in these operations understand what they9re doing.

They

aren't high school kids., who think they're doing market
research.
Because those situations wouldn't even be
prosecuted.

Because they would never be successful enough.

In the actual, real world of bookmaking, the
conspiracy would be consummated when the substantive offense
is consummated.
So that, actually, what I'm saying is that the
conspiracy really doesn't — is such an integral part of
the substantive offense, it really doesn't exist.
And what I'm also saying is, of course, that in
view of the substantive statute, in view of the fact that it
requires every ingredient of a conspiracy, then we feel that
Congress — the court should not countenance dual punishment.
We don't think that, these
punished twice for the same crime.

petitioners should be
And we feel that here

they have been punished twice for the same crime.
And I would —

20

QUESTION?

In your submission in response to Mr.

Justice Stewart, do I understand you correctly to say that
if both offenses are submitted to the jury, the jury can take
its choice, but they must — they are mutually exclusive?
MR. MeLhUGHLIN?

They are mutually exclusive.

As I said, that certainly as a minimum, I would feel the
District Court would have to tell the jury that they may not
find the defendant guilty of both, that if they find the
substantive offense, then they must disregard —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. McLAUGHLIN:
QUESTION:

— not regard the conspiracy also.

You agree, however, that 'they are not

necessarily mutually exclusive, that there could be a conspiracy
without any eviaence at all of the ultimate commission of the
substantive offense?
MR. McLAUGHLIN:

That's a hypothetical possibility,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Well, before the hypothetical — there

may be no reported cases, but it's certainly not an Alice in
Wonderland idea.

People can plan to set up a gambling

operation and then, by reasons of death or illness or competition
or various other reasons, they can be

it can be

frustrated.
MR. McLAUGHLIN:
QUESTION:

I would certainly —

And that would be a conspiracy without a

21
substantive offense»
MR. McLAUGHLIN;
is possible.

I would certainly concede that it

Surely, that five persons could agree, say,

Let’s start a gambling business, and make one phone call to
another fellow and say, you know, Let’s do something.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

MR. McLAUGHLIN; And that really is a conspiracy.
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

That’s right.
If I followed you, that's a different

answer from the one you gave me a few moments ago.
MR. McLAUGHLIN: I don’t think it’s ~ I don’t think
it's a probable situation; and in the instance where you have
the substantive offense and the court is satisfied that
there is sufficient evidence to submit the substantive offense
to the jury, then, clearly, there is a conspiracy, too.
Because the substantive offense requires one.
if, in Mr. Justice Stewart’s hypothesis, there
could — as there could be a conspiracy without the substantive
offense, the District Court shouldn’t submit the question of
the substantive offense to the jury, because it’s probably
so clear that there’s no evidence to support it.

But they

shouldn’t be permitted to consider it anyway.
QUESTION;

You're analogizing this in a sense to

having a jury find a man guilty of a given crime and a lesser
included offense under the same statute?

22
MR. McLAUGHLIMs

It's somewhat similar, yes, sir.

I think I have a few minutes left, and I'll save it
for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Evans.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. EVANS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The government has four contentions in this case.
First, Wharton’s Rule has no application at all to
Section 1955.
Second, even if it does have application, this case,
comes within a standard exception to Wharton's Rule, because
there were more persons involved in the conspiracy in this
case than the minimum number required to commit the substantive
offense.
QUESTION:

Would that mean that if you had a case

where there were exactly five people, v/ho conspired and who
then carried out their conspiracy by conducting a gambling
operation, that Wharton's Rule would be applicable?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Well, in our contention —
I mean just with respect to your

point two, now.
MR. EVANS:

As to point two, that's right.

23

Third, when Wharton’s Rule does apply, its effect
is solely to prohibit double punishment for the conspiracy
and the substantive offense? it does not bar an indictment,
either alone or together with the substantive offense, and
it does not. bar submitting both counts to the jury under
proper instructions along the lines that Mr. Justice Stewart
was discussing with Mr. McLaughlin a little earlier.
Finally, even if Wharton’s Rule applies to -this
case and does bar an indictment, petitioners still would not
be entitled, in this case, to-a new trial, as Mr. McLaughlin
suggested at one point as an alternative disposition. There
would be no need for new trial.

All that would be necessary

would be to vacate the sentences that were imposed, on the
conspiracy convictions.
And I’d like to start, if I may, just by briefly
addressing that final point, because it can be taken with
the assumption that every tiling that Mr. McLaughlin has said
about Wharton’s Rule's application to Section 1955 in this
case is true.
Now, he has suggested in his brief, and he alluded
to it again at argument, that a new trial would be necessary
hes.'e apparently because the presence of the conspiracy count
during the course of the trial and in the jury's deliberations
has so tainted the jury’s verdictcn the substantive count
that there can

that there must be a new trial to eliminate

24
this taint.
As we understand the argument, if it rests upon a
notion that in the absence of the conspiracy count all the
hearsay declarations that were admitted at this trial would
have been excluded, and they would not be admissible on a
retrial only of the substantive — only on the substantive
count.
We think this is wrong for several reasons.
First, as we show in our brief, the admissibility of
hearsay declarations of co-conspirators does not depend upon
the presence of an indictment — of a conspiracy count in the
indictment.

It depends only upon a showing by non-hearsay

evidence that there was in fact a joint venture in crime, of
which the defendant was a member.
QUESTION; This argument leads you right into Mr.
McLaughlin's cave, doesn’t it?

You’re saying that they're

the same.
MR. EVANS;
saine.

No.

No, we’re not saying they’re the

We're saying that — well, I'm not sure —
QUESTION;

You're saying that the substantive

offenses are basically the same because they support the same
exceptions to the heeirsay rule.
MR. iVANS:

Well, we're -- in a sense, if Wharton's

Rule applies, I’m here taking everything he has said as given if Wharton's Rule applies, yes, there is inherent in the sub-

25
s tainti ve offense the very conspiracy to which he objects, in
terms of a separate count.
QUESTIONS

I see.

You’re beginning this argument

by —

MR. EVANS:

I'm just beginning by accepting every­

thing, just to discuss only what should be done with this
case if everything were accepted.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. EVANS:

Now, even if, for some reason, the

hearsay testimony would be inadmissible if there were only the
substantive count at trial, the District Judge here, contrary
to the suggestion that Mr. McLaughlin’s brief makes,
specifically instructed the jury that they could consider that
hearsay testimony ~~ those hearsay declarations only in
connection with the

conspiracy count, on page 61 of the
*

Appendix.

He made a very elaborate effort to direct the

jury’s attention to the conspiracy count only last, and he
stated that this is why I start off with the other counts and
work towards the first count.
That evidence, the hearsay evidence, would not be
admissible in proving guilt under the second count, the
section 1955 count.

But it could be admissible under the
■

circumstances I just enumerated with you in

k

proving the

guilt of conspiracy.
So even if, for some reason, the hearsay declarations

26
could not be admitted — should not have been admitted in
this trial, there is no reason to believe that the jury dis­
regarded the explicit instruction — disregarded with respect
to the substantive count.
Our contention, in essence, is that there has been
no taint attached to the substantive conviction in this case,
and no reason to remand for a new trial on that count, in any
event.
The heart of this case is the question whether
Wharton's Rule applies at all, in the context of section 19555
and before I address the statutory question X think it would be
helpful to outline our theory of Wharton's Rule.
We start with two principles, consistent principles,
we believe.
First, that a conspiracy ordinarily is separate and
distinct from its substantive aim, because each requires proof
of a fact that the other does not.
For

example, a conspiracy to commit a bank robbery

requires proof of an agreement between the two robbers to
commit the crime.
But it does not require proof that the robbery was
actually consummated.
On the other hand, the substantive charge of bank
robbery requires proof that the crime was consummated, but
not that there was any agreement to commit it.

27
And this Court has accordingly held, in many cases,
that cumulative sentences may be imposed upon convictions for
both the conspiracy and its substantive aim.
That is so because a conspiracy is thought to pose
dangers beyond those posed by the commission of the substantive
offense itself.
And, unlike an attempt, for that reason, the
conspiracy does not merge within the completed substantive
offense.
Now, the second principle, as 1 say, that's consistent
with this, is the — basically an application of the
constitutional protection against double jeopardy.
When one offense is necessarily included within
another, a person may not be given cumulative sentences for
a single act that violates both.
For example, assaulting a federal officer is
necessarily included within tine greater crime of assaulting
a federal officer with the use of a deadly weapon.

It is

impossible under any circumstances to commit the greater offense
without also committing the lesser.
QUESTION?

What case is that?

What authority are

you relying on for that, Mr. Evans, that double jeopardy
forbids that?
MR. EVANS;

Well, I'm inferring it from decisions

of this Court, most particularly North Carolina v. Pearce, in

2B
which the Court stated that —QUESTION; Well, there are others, toe,
MR. EVANSi
QUESTION;

And there may be others, too.

That —

Well, you seem to make these rather flat

statements in your brief as being straightforward applications
of the double jeopardy clause.
Such ag the conviction of the greater offense bars
later prosecution of the included offense.
I would suppose you're just not saying anything
more than, in what you just said.
MR. EVANS;

That’s right.

Oh, well, I cite some cases on this point.
QUESTION; Exactly.
MR. EVANS:

Yes.

Right, yes.

We're looking for a constitutional -—

you put it out in your brief, are just straight double

in our view, upon —
QUESTION;

It may not agree with your views of these

cases, but at least you seem to — you feel you are just
explicating the double jeopardy clause.

29

MR. EVANS;

This, we thinks is the source of

Wharton's Rule, properly understood.

It’s no broader —

I mean, in a sense we’re giving it a constitutional footing
so that its scope can be appreciated.
QUESTION: Well, did Wharton think that when he
evolved it?
MR. EVANS:

No, Wharton •— Wharton did not.

Wharton's Rule, in my view, is an anomaly.

It developed, as

we explain in our brief, from what we view as a misreading of
an 1850 Pennsylvania State Court decision.

There’s no

comparable rule in England, and the leading British
commentator, as I indicated in he brief, thinks that the
rule is unnecessarily subtle.
Well, we’ve thought about it a great deal, and we
concluded that it has an application as part of the broader
rule that w© think would be applicable in the case of a
lesser included offense in the greater offense.
We do think that the double jeopardy clause would
bar an imposition of two punishments for assaulting a
federal officer, for example, with a deadly weapon and for
the crime that necessarily was included within it, namely,
the assault upon the officer.
QUESTION: Well, how about the reverse:

punishment

for assault on a federal officer, and punishment for assault
with a deadly weapon on a federal officer?

And the. former

30
necessarily being included in the latter.
Would you say conviction for the included offense
would bar prosecution for the greater?
MR. EVANS: Well, v?e think that —
QUESTION:

You say that in the —

MR. EVANS:

Yes.

It's not obviously this case.

We’re not — this has no application to it.

We mention that

only in passing.
QUESTION: Well, it may not be involved in tills case
because — assume there's a conviction for conspiracy and
then an indictment for the substantive offense.
Now, if the rule was that conviction for the
included offense is — precludes conviction for the greater
offense, then the issue is involved here.
MR. EVANS:

Well, Mr. Justice White, I believe that

we're inferring that rule from a combination of the cases
we've cited, but Waller is basically the case.
As I recall it, that was a conviction on a local
ordinance that was — the court stated that the offense was
included within the —

Well, what about BlackX&dge v. Perry

31
MR. EVANS3

Ifm not familiar with it.

QUESTIONS Well, that's pretty much on the point here.
MR. EVANS;

But, in any ©vent, I really don't think

we have to struggle with this issue, it's not really presented
here.

We only mention it in passing, to suggest the

contours of what would be the rule with respect to lesser
included offenses and greater offenses.
QUESTION;

Well, your friend was saying that this

is analogous, this case is analogous to a lesser included
offense situation.
MR. EVANS;
QUESTION;

I take it you don’t accept that?
No, we do not.
You seem fco be coming a little close to

the edges of it there, though.
MR. EVANS; Well, I was outlining, Mr. Chief Justice,
what our view is of the proper application of Wharton's Rule.
We think it applies only where it can be stated that the
conspiracy is a lesser included offense of the substantive
crime, 30 that one could not possibly, in any circumstances,
commit the substantive crime without also conspiring to do
so.
And the example that we use in the brief, and we
think is the clearest example, is the case of dueling,
which is defined in terms of an armed combat between two
persons pursuant to an agreement to do so.
Now, in order to commit a duel under ‘that definition,

32
you must agree fco do sc, you must, in effect, commit each of
the elements of a conspiracy,
Nov; , in that content we have no question that this
is the appropriate case in which to apply this general —
whatever the general double jeopardy rules may be, with respect
to lesser included offenses and greater offenses.
When we come to section 1955, however, fell is is not
a — this is not anywhere, anything like dueling.
I think, looking at 1955, and recalling the central
question, I think that our theory of Wharton's Rule is whether
it would be possible under any circumstances to commit the
substantive crime of conducting an illegal gambling business,
without also conspiring to do so.
Now, the statute defines illegal gambling business
as one that involves five or more persons who conduct it.
But it does not state and it does not apply, in our view,
that all five must be knowing and wilful participants.
The purpose of the £Lve~persoh requirement, like that of the
other requirements in -the definition, was to limit the
allocation of federal resources to large gambling operations.
The requirement is one of sise, not one of culpability.
This is confirmed, we think, by the form that was
used by Congress in drafting the statute, which is set out at
page 2 of our brief.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the purpose of that was

33

to get some federal nexus, wasn't it, some effect on inter­
state commerce?
MR,, EVANS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, the Congress

found that gambling generally has an impact upon interstate
commerce.

It specifically stated, however, that it declined

to prohibit, although it thought it was within its reach to
do so, it declined to prohibit all gambling operations,
because it wished to limit federal resources to the major
operations, of major proportions.
I don't think this is an essential link for federal
jurisdiction, but it's the one Congress picked for policy
purposes.
QUESTION: Well, wasn't part of the policy theory
that they were going to leave these small operations to the
States?
MR. EVANS:

That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice.

Now — but in doing so, the Congress specifically recognised
in its legislative reports that while it normally assumed
that more than five persons would be involved in the kind of
operations it had in mind, that it recognised that it's very
difficult to prove the full extent of most gambling operations.
And for that reason it chose five as a number.
And again I believe it chose the number in terms of
the sise of the operation, it did not specify, and there's no
.reason to believe it had in mind —

34
QUESTIONs

It might just as easily have decided

to cut the line at ten.

MR. EVANS:
cut it at ten.

It might just as easily have decided to

I believe it was a legislative choice, that

this v/ould be an appropriate limit to permit prosecutions of
large gamling operations in which not everyone could be
proved to be involved, without having the federal courts
burdened by peewee prosecutions.
QUESTION:

Let’s see if I understand you.

Had they

set it at two, you’re suggesting there would be no attack on
basic federal jurisdiction?
MR. EVANS:

Well, I — there may foe an attack upon

it, I'm just pointing out that Congress believed that the
reach of its authority extended beyond the limit

that was

chosen in the statute.
We believe that Congress deliberately left open in
the statute the possibility of prosecuting a sole bookmaker,
to use the hypothetical we use in our brief, who hires
innocent persons to help him operate his gambling business.
And it did so because it realized that it may be that
there were other people involved, but

guilty persons

involved, people who were culpable, but it’s not always easy to
prove their involvement.

It’s enough to prove that there is

one culpable individual operating a business large enough to
merit federal attention.

Now f we -think that this demonstrates, or it
answers the question I started with, that is, whether it is
possible in any c i r curas tan cos to commit the substantive
offense without conspiring to do so.

The answer is, it is

possible.
It’s a theoretical inquiry, granted, and there
probably will never be such a case.
not be such a case.

There may or there may

I know of none.

But this is a question of what would be possible,
and we believe -that in this circumstance in which one guilty,
culpable person hires enough persons to operate his business
to bring it within federal ■— the scope of federal jurisdic­
tion, that he would be guilty of the substantive offense, but
he could not be convicted of a conspiracy, because there would
be no proof that he conspired with any other culpable
person involved in the operation.
Now, one might properly ask, I think, in these
circumstances, whether Congress really intended that a person
who violates Section 1955 should be subject to the additional
punishment for a conspiracy, which probably would be connected
with the large operation. But we think that this Court’s
decision in Callanan is an answer to that question. That was
not a Wharton's Rule case, but an analogous argument was made.
Caliar-an argued that Congress could not have intended
to subject him to multiple punishment for conspiracy and

obstructing commerce by extortion, because both crimes were
created by the same section of the statute.
The Court stated, however, that the historic
distinctiveness between a conspiracy and its substantive
aim gives rise to a presumption that Congress intended to
maintain that distinction, and to maintain the separate
punitive consequences of each.
And the Court stated, in a sentence that I think is
worth quoting •— it appears on page 42of our brief —■ "To
dislodge such conventional consequences in the outlawing of
two disparate offenses, conspiracy and substantive conduct,
and effectuate a reversal of the settled interpretation ...
would require specific language to 'the contrary."
Well, there is no such specific language to the
contrary in this statute, and we believe that the presumption
established by Callanan should be applied in this case as well
QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, I'm not sure I understand the

argument you're malting, a moment or two ago.
It's your submission, is it, that at least
theoretically, a single individual could be giiilty of violating
Section 1955?
MR. EVANS:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Because he would be the only one with

mans rea or with knowledge of what was going on —
MR. EVANS:

Correct.

37
QUESTION:

Is that it?

And he could •— he would

hire four or more people who just didn't know what was going
on upstairs; is that it?
MR, EVANSs
QUESTION;
MR, EVANS:

That's right.
In a gambling operation?
Well, we’re not suggesting that this is

likely, we're just suggesting that —
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Oh.
—- the statute permits

would permit a

prosecution in those circumstances.
The Court of Appeals rested its decision in this
case on a ground that this Count needn’t consider, unless it
first finds contrary to our contention, that Section 1955 does
necessarily include a conspiracy.

That ground is that this

case fall3 within the standard exception to the rule that
permits prosecution for a conspiracy when it involves more
persons than the minimum number essential to the commission
of the substantive offense.
This exception has been recognized, even by this
Court, in the Gebardi case, and it’s now accepted by the
current edition of Wharton's Treatise.
We think it's consistent with the rationale of the
rule itself.

Separata punishment, in our view, is precluded

by Wharton's Rule on the theory that Congress took into
account, in establishing the punishment for the substantive

3e
offense, all the dangers Inherent in the commission of the
substantive offense, including the dangers involved in any
necessarily included conspiracy.
But when the conspiracy exceeds in number the minimum
number necessary to the commission of the substantive crime,
its dangers are likely to be increased also.
And there is no reason, in these circumstances, to
presume that Congress intended to limit the punishment where
the conspiracy is greater than — or creates dangers greater
than those inherent in the substantive crime itself.
QUESTION:

Let me suggest a hypothetical to you to

pursue Mr. Justice StewartEs proposition, that you might have
four innocent and one guilty:

Would this situation do it,

if you had a mountain resort up on the borders of Nevada,
and four people were hired and told that it was in Nevada and
that it was perfectly legal to be running the gambling opera­
tion, being professional gamblers from Las Vegas or soma place,
but the one man who was running the showT knows that it is in
whatever State — in an adjacent State which makes it illegal.
What would be the situation then?
MR. EVANS:

Well, that might be a situation —

QUESTION:

It*s a pretty strained example.

MR. EVANS:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that while

only -the one who knows would be guilty of the substantive
crime, that he might well be guilty of the conspiracy as well.

39

Because while the four
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
I’m not sure.

Would he not if he deceived —
Well, I guess it may — it may fit,

It may be the same thing.

QUESTION:
HR. EVANS:

It isn't likely that —
It may be the same thing. Any example

you hypothesize is bound to be an unlikely one, because this
is not the normal situation, but what matters is that even in
those hypothetical situations it seems to me clear — seems
to us clear, that the statute would permit prosecution of the
one individual. And we believe there are circumstances and
this may be another one in which the — there would be no
prosecution for conspiracy.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Of the four, you mean?
Of any.

Now, on my hypothetical, at least, and perhaps on
yours, too, Hr. Chief Justice, the — in order to be convicted
of conspiracy, there must be at least two persons —
QUESTION:

You mean there on all the parties —

MR. EVANS:

Well, not — well, there has to be at

least two persons who share in the guilty knowledge.
Now, to the extent that the four here do not share
in the guilty knowledge, I would say that their agreement with
him was not a meeting of the minds sufficient to constitute
the kind of agreement that’s punishable as a conspiracy.

40
To conclude, 1 think it's worth recalling Mr, Justice
Holmes' statement that was quoted in this Court's decision in
Call an. an, he said, "To rest upon a formula is a slumber that,
prolonged, means death*"
Well, we think that for many years Wharton's Rule
has'been applied by the courts uncritically, and we urge the
Court in this case to reconsider the formula and to apply it,
if at all, only consistent with its proper rationale.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. EVANS:

~ Resumed

Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't quite get

out my conclusion, and during lunch it occurred to me that it
might be worth clarifying some points that were raised during
the pre-lunch point.
Mr. Justice White, to address further the question
that we were discussing earlier about double jeopardy:

We

don't mean to suggest that it is beyond the power of Congress
or a legislature to prescribe that although a crime includes
another that both should be punished separately. We think
this is within the newer of Congress.
We think, however, that once it is determined that
Congress did not intend separate punishment, that is, it was
if
intended — in other words, that/nothing was said about it
at all, we believe the presumption should be that single
punishment is what was intended, and we believe that the
decisions of this Court make it clear that in those circum­
stances it would be improper to —
QUESTION:

Would you say that Congress may define

an offense that includes another offense, and it may prescribe

42
punishments for both and in the same or separate conviction
they may be separately punished?
MR. EVANS:

Now, whether they could — whether —

it would depend upon the will of Congress.
QUESTION:

Well, let's say the will of Congx-ess is

perfectly clear that you can punish for both the included
offense and the greater offense in the same prosecution.
You may charge and. convict and punish for both,.
MR. EVANS;

I think that that would be constitution­

ally permissible.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION;
MR. EVANS:

You think it would?
Yes.
Although —
And I think it’s the functional

equivalent of Congress saying — let's just take a concrete
example, take the assault on a federal officer.

The statute,

as I remember it, says that it's three years for assaulting a
federal officer.

It's ten years for assaulting a federal

officer with the use of a deadly weapon.
Now, if Congress-were to say these punishments —
that the ten years for assaulting a federal officer with a
deadly weapon shall be in addition to the three years that would
be otherwise imposed for simply assaulting a federal officer,
I think that's constitutionally permissible.
The same thing as if Congress said, three years for

assaulting a federal officer, thirteen years for assaulting a
federal officer with a deadly weapon.
QUESTION; What about murder and manslaughter?
You wouldn’t suggest that they could make — punish for both
in one crime —
MR. EVANS:

Well, I think Congress could, or a

legislature could, but it would be the same thing as saying —
I mean it would just be an awkward way for the legislature
to have imposed simply a higher punishment for the greater
crime by saying that you can cumulate the greater- and the
lesser, is just another way of saying the greater shall be —

Well, do you have to go that far in 'this

case?
MR. EVANS:

you may have said in your brief.
MR. EVANS:

of punishment for criminal conduct ’are peculiarly questions

What about the Nielsen case that you

cite in your footnote?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Well, Nielsen was not that —
Nielsen was cohabitation, conviction,

later prosecution for adultery, conviction; and this Court
set it aside, because that was an included offense.
MR. EVANS:

In Nielsen there was a — it was a

conviction of a greater offense, and there was then an
attempt to prosecute —
QUESTION:

That's right, but in what I gave you

MR. EVANS:

Well, what I'm suggesting is that

it's within the power of the legislature to provide —
QUESTION: But the legislature in that instance,
in Nielsen, did that.

46

MR. EVANS:

Well, the legislature —

QUESTION: The Utah Legislature did precisely that.
They tried him first for cohabitationf which was a
federal statute.

He was convicted. And then he was tried for

the adultery, which was also a federal statute; and he was
convicted. And this Court set it aside and said it couldn’t
do that.
MR. EVANS:

Well, what I5m suggesting -— there’s

nothing in Nielsen,, as I recall Nielsen, that indicated that
there was an express determination by the legislature that
both crimes should be punished and punished separately; that
one who commits both should be punished for both separately.
What I’m suggesting is that in the absence of
such a determination, that’s right, that I would think the
double jeopardy probably does prohibit it.
QUESTION:

But —

I know, but if this Court held, as I

understand Justice Bradley’s opinion —• I never saw the case
until you cited it — if I understand his opinion, at page 191,
that’s double jeopardy.
MR. EVANS: Well —
QUESTION:

And what can a legislature do, in the

face of the double jeopardy?
MR. EVANS: Well, I believe that this aspect of the
double jeopardy protection depends upon a threshold
analysis of what it is that the legislature has determined.

QUESTIONS

You mean the legislature in that instance,

if it had said. Yes, and we mean even if convicted he may be
tried a second time?
MR, EVANS:
QUESTION;

Yes.
If it said that in many words, not­

withstanding the double jeopardy clause, the adultery
conviction would have been —■
MR. EVANS:

That's correct.

I believe that3s

correct.
QUESTION: What authority do you get for that?
MR. EVANS:

Well, there's no —- there's never been

a case that I can point to.

As a matter of fact, the issue

may be raised in a peripheral way in the case that's pending.
But that-’3 my view of what the double jeopardy clause —
how it works in the context of double punishment for the same
act3 that violate two provisions.
It may be different, where you're talking about
success of prosecutions, but this is my understanding of
how it works in this context.
QUESTION:

And here you're talking about — we're

talking about a case, I thought, of planning it and doing it.
MR. EVANS:

That's right.

QUESTION: And Congress has said that they are
two separate crimes.
MR. EVANS:

That's our position, right.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. McLAUGHLIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McLAUGHLIN;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

I will address myself solely to one point, and that's
the point of a proper relief.
Tiie government, at page 14 of its brief, has conceded
that if Wharton's Rule applies, and we of course contend that
it does, that the proper procedure would have been to instruct
the jury to consider the conspiracy count only if they have
found the defendants not guilty of the substantive offense.
The government further conceded, at page 14 of its
brief, that this procedure, proper procedure was not followed
in this case.
Where we depart from the government is then what is
the proper relief for the petitioners hare; and we submit
that we are entitled to the relief that Mr. Justice Stewart
?

found required in the case of Milanovich vs. United States,
which, unfortunately, we did not cite in our brief.
QUESTION:

That was receiving stolen property and —

MR. McLAUGHLIN: That’s right. Your Honor.

— the conviction for both.

And that remedy is a new trial.
In closing, x*e submit that Professor Francis
Wharton was buried 85 years ago; I trust that his rule will
not be buried in this term.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

[Whereupon, at 1:08 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.3
