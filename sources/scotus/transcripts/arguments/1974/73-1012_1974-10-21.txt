MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1012, Gulf Oil Corporation against Copp Paving
Company.
Mr. Lasky, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MOSES LASKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LASKY;

Ilr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This case concerns the jurisdictional requirements
of interstate commerce in three sections of the Clayton Act;
Section 2, which is the Robinson-Patman Act; Section 3, which
is the provision prohibiting certain tying arrangements; and
Section 7, which is commonly called the Celler-Kefauver Act
or amendment, which has to do with mergers and acquisitions.
The case does not involve any question at all of
what Congress's powers are, it involves no question of what
Congress can do, it only involves the question of what, in
fact, it has seen fit to do by the legislation it has
enacted.
Now, the starting point, I assume, of any considera­
tion of what an Act of Congress means, is the language of the
Act of Congress.
The jurisdictional requirements of the three Acts
that I speak of are much the same, and are to be contrasted

with the provision of the Sherman Act.

Because they ars much

narrower.
Now, each cna of these three Acts, each one requires
that the proscribed conduct have an effect and an impact on
interstate or foreign commerce.

2\nd I!ll use the word ’commerce

hereafter for interstate or foreign commerce.
The language of the three is identical.

It is required

that the, quote, "effect may be substantially to lessen
competition or tend to create a monopoly in a line of commerce."
And in this' respect these three are identical with the
Sherman Act.
commerce.

They require an effect or impact on interstate

But the Sherman Act requires no more.

Under the

Sherman Act it makes no difference who commits the conduct or
where it occurs, if it has an effect on interstate commerce.
But here, under there three Clayton Act sections,
much more is required.

Effect or impact, which is expressly

spoiled out and required, is only one of several of the tests
of jurisdiction mandated by these Acts.
Robinson-Patman requires, in addition to the effect or
impact, that the discriminatory sale be, and I quote, "by a

,

person engaged in commerce

in the course of such commerce",

and again a discrimination requires at least two sales to have
a discrimination between it, requires, quote, "either or any
of the purchasers:involved must be in commerce.M
That's in addition to the effect or impact clause.

5
Section 3 has almost the identical language, it
requires that the tying conduct be that of a, quote, "person
engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce."
And Section 7, the anti-acquisition section, requires
not only that the effect be adverse on the line of commerce,
but that the acquiring corporation be, quote, "a corporation
engaged in commerce" and, in addition, that the acquired
corporation be a corporation engaged in commerce.
Mow, before we gc further to discuss the effect of
these Acts on this case, it's necessary to find out what
product we’re talking about.

Because that’s the key to this

case.
The product involved in this case is a substance
known as asphaltic concrete.

Not asphalt, and I emphasize

it’s not liquid asphalt, because liquid asphalt moves in
interstate commerce, and while this case started as one of
what later became consolidated as the Western Liquid Asphalt
cases, the trial court carved out the asphaltic concrete
aspects of it and left the liquid asphalt aspects still going,
they’re still in the court, theyrre still proceeding with the
rest of the Western Liquid Asphalt cases.
Asphaltic concrete

let me say, when the Court

carved it out, the Court said at the beginning there seemed
to be a jurisdictional problem on asphaltic concrete, it
directed the plaintiff to take all the discovery he needed on

6

the jurisdictional elements, come back and make his showing.
And when that occurred, the Court ruled out the asphaltic
concrete elements„
Asphaltic concrete is a product made in California
and which, by its very nature, cannot be sold across the State
line»

It's a bulky product, composed of 95 percent of rock,

sand and gravel, which is mined in the local pits? and the other
five percent is liquid asphalt, also produced in California
from California refineries.
This material is used as a topping, blacktop, streets,
roadways, driveways.

In order to make it, you mix the rock

with hot asphalt in a hot plant, end the product has to be
laid down before it cools.
down with 35 miles

Consequently, it has to be laid

>£ 'the plant where it's made.

That 'means' it can't move in interstate commerce.
The hot plants of all the parties in this case are located in
California.

The hot plants of the plaintiff are all located

in the Los Angeles Basin.

The hot plants of the acquired

corporation involved in the Section 7 aspect of this case,
Sully-Miller, are all located in the Los Angeles Basin.
That is to say, Los Angeles County and the suburbs around it.
None of the asphaltic concrete

made and sold, involved

in this case, ever got within 200 miles of an interstate border
of Califomia.
Now, the Hob in con~ Patman, Section 3, count,: concern

7
sales of asphaltic concrete by the petitioner, Industrial
Asphalt*

It is accused of having discriminated, and yet none

of its asphaltic concrete sales ever got within 200 miles of
the California border.
None of them ever crossed a State line, none of them
ever could cress a State line.
Now, the Section 7 count involves the acquisition
by Union Oil Company, which is not in the asphaltic concrete
business, of one Sully-Miller.

Sully-Miller has its plants

solely in Los Angeles County and neighboring Orange County,
It makes asphaltic concrete from local materials, sells it
within a 35-mile range of Los Angeles; it also engages as a
paving contractor.

And the complaint, the amended complaint

in this case alleged that Sully-Miller?s business was being
engaged primarily in the business of operating asphaltic
concrete hot plants and contracting street improvements.

It's

a street paver.
Now, this appears in the Appendix at page 15.
Its plants are in the Los Angeles Basin.

It’s a

contractor in paving streets in tin at particular area, all 200
miles or thereabouts from the border.
Now, upon this state of undisputed fact, the District
Court ruled that the jurisdictional requirements of Sections
2, 3, and 7 were absent.

It said that the Robinson-Patman Act

did not apply, because no sale by Industrial of asphaltic

a
concrete was in commerce.

No sale was made in the course of

commerce.
For the same reason, they held that Section 3, the
tying section, did not apply.,
And it held that Section 7 did not apply to Union's
acquisition of Suliy-Miller, for the simple reason that SullyMiller was not a corporation engaged in commerce,,
I may add that the District Court also found that
there wasn't any effect on interstate commerce•

And it had

given the plaintiffs, the petitioners, every opportunity to
shot/ tbsir jurisdictional facts.
This case went to the Court of Appeals on an inter­
locutory appeal allowed under 1292(b), and that Court reversed.
How, until the decision in this case, it had been the
uniform decision of a mass of cases that Robi ns on - P a tin an does
not apply unless at least one of the sales involving a
discrimination crosses the State: line.
The Court ■:£ Appeals dismissed, this State line test.
And it did it because it said asphaltic concrete is used on
streets and roads.

Streets and roads are all hooked up and

eventually something crosses the State line, so you have an
interstate highway system, therefore the roads and streets are
linked up to, quote, "an instrumentality of commerce", and,
therefore, said it, as a matter of law the seller and the sale
are engaged in commerce.

As for Sully-Miller, it hold that as a matter of law
it was engaged in commerce, because it sold asphaltic concrete
for use on roads and because it paved streets.

As I say, all

200 miles from an interstate border.
Now, the Ninth Circuit ignored the finding of no
effect on interstate commerce, because it said that because an
interstate instrumentality of commerce vra3 involved, a road,
everybody was engaged in commerce, and if you're engaged in
commerce the effect follows as a matter of law.
I'm not going to discuss that.

This Court

we

petitioned for cert on the — certiorari upon the Sherman Act
issue, and certiorari was not allovred on that; so that's not
before us.
The proposition we advance now is that the judgment,
the decision was wrong because no sales were mace in commerce
by anybody engaged in commerce, and nobody engaged in commerce
was acquired.
Now, just this year, on May 24th, the Fifth Circuit,
in Scran ton Construction _vs,_ JLitton Industrie's, reported in
494 Fed 2d at 778, referred to the decision below, the very one
I'm here on now.

It referred to it as a, quote, "new deliver­

ance" and refused to follow it.
Now, this Court granted certiorari to review this
new rule of law.

And yet, now that we're here, the decision

of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is barely defended.

10

The Solicitor General has filed an amicus brief, the
other day, in which he urges that Sections 3 and 7 should be
read as if they were co~extensive with the Sherman Act»
In other words, you delete all the language about sales in
commerce, in the course of commerce, by a corporation engaged
in commerce, and read the Acts as if they required no more than
the Sherman Act.
Curiously enough, he says nothing about the RobinsonPatman Act.

He just talks about Section 3 and Section 7.

We know, of course, that the Department of Justice,
in the Antitrust Division, have never been lovers of the
Rob ins on “-Patman Act, and apparently they don't seek to defend

the decision.
But the language of those sections ore all the seme.
And that whatever decision is made about 3 or 7'would, of
necessity, have to apply to the Robinson-Patman, which is 2.

The principal argument made in respondents' brief
is exactly the same as the Solicitor General's, namely, that
with respect to all these Acts, Robinson-Patrnan, 3 and 7, they
should be read as expansively as the Sherman Act, and that
nothing is required other than effect on commerce.
/

Nov;, if I may be forgiven to characterize them, I
would say that these two lines of argument are:

one, would

work surgery, by excising the specific provisions of RobinsonPatman, Sections 3 and 7? and the ether, that of the court

11
below, is applying LSD to the language, and arriving at a
rather strange interpretation»
Now, let me turn to the reason of the Court of Appeals»
The great Chief Justice Trainer of California once wrote about
the use of magic words, as if the use of a certain phraseology
somehow decided a case»

And I respectfully submit that that’s

what the Ninth Circuit did.

It picks up the words "interstate

highway", which has an inflated sound divorced from reality.
It attaches a conclusive significance to that, and then also
looked for analogy to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is
an Act of quite different language, purpose and background.
The court below talks about interstate highways, and,
if the Court please, that is not a legal term.

It is a loose

terminology for roads, for whose construction the federal
government, under grant-in-aid statute, the Federal Highway
Aid Act, contributes money.
It does so for forest roads, trials, farm-to-market
roads, local rural roads, streets, parkways, county roads,
and also State roads selected to connect the principal
canters.
Respondent called on the petitioners to admit, by
request for admission, and we did admit that 98.5 percent of
these funds received by the State of California went for county
roads.

We've already observed that Sully-Miller was a street

paver in the suburbs of Los Angeles.

12
All roads for which federal aid is given are under
the jurisdiction of the State, local governments; the federal
Act, Highway Aid. Act, does not presume to regulate highways,
or operations of those working on them or supplying materials
for them, it. does do no more than attach conditions to the
gift.

And none of those conditions have anything to do with

the problems of this case.
And so I respectfully submit that what the decision
of the court below comes to is to advance this proposition:
since every street in every city and every road anywhere in the
United States, unless it connects with no other, is part of an
interstate network of highways; therefore, the seller of
anything used in a street or a road is in commerce.
And by that reasoning the local Society for the Care
of the Blind,

that sells brooms made by -the blind to be used

for 'sweeping the streets, or the street cleaner or the tow-truck
operator who removes illegally parked cars on the streets, all
are engaged in commerce.
Now, this Court over and over again, in its interstate
'commerce decisions, has said that the concept of commerce is
guided by the most practical considerations.

Commerce is an.

intensely practical concept drawn from the normal and accepted
course of business.
These are statements the Court has made.
Now, if this case concerned workers constructing a

13
lock across a canal, or a drawbridge across the Mississippi,
one might see such an immediacy to the operation of an inter»
state facility.

But you might come to the conclusion there,

practically, that the construction of that bridge was in
in te rs tate comme r c®.
But, I submit, that from any practical reality,
selling asphaltic concrete to put on a street or a road, 200
miles from the border, simply is a horse of another color,
also paving a city street.
Now, if the Court please, to get back to a funda»
mental.

Our system of government is federalism, certainly,

where a federal statute plainly applies.

It has to be applied.

But when,to apply it is going to intrude upon local
policy and to apply it requires some Procrustean treatment,
some stretching, then we’ve been taught by the decisions of
this Court that the hand is stayed.
Now, the philosophy of the Robins on-P atman Act is a
highly debatable one.

This Court has frequently commented how

it is in conflict with the philosophy of the Sherman Act,
California has considered that Robinson-Patman and has
deliberately refused to adopt a Robinson-Patman type statute.
California Supreme Court, reviewing the matter, has said no,
California has no Robinson-Patman type statute, and has noted
this conflict of policy.
And yet what has happened here is that a federal Act

14
has been, extended into the California area to something local,
the mis conception that asphaltic concrete is put upon a road.
Now, if the Court please, California also has not
adopted any general anti-acquisition statute.

The proposed

Uniform State Antitrust Law has deliberately left out a Section
7 type provision, on the idea that acquisitions at a local
level have a different impact and deal with different kind of
policies than on a national level.
So I say again, the question here is not how far
Congress could go — I think Congress could, go the full length
'here, if it wished to.

How far has it gone?

And in deciding that question, respect, has to be
paid, first, to the language Congress has used; and, secondly,
to the federal structure of the union.

The opinion, the decision of the Court of

Appeals was base:! upon that one fact, that a road is an
instrumentality of commerce, the asphaltic concrete went into
the road, therefore it was, as a matter of law, engaged in
commerce.
That's the decision of the Court of Appeals,
not strongly defended, as I say.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lasky, would you be making a different

argument here if this were centered in San Diego rather than
Los Angeles?
MR. LASKY5
QUESTION;

No, I don’t think so.
Even though, then, the State line is

within 35 miles of such plants as might be used.
MR. LASKY;

When w® said 35 miles, everybody has

been ta3.king generously.

The evidence talks about 5 to 15»

I think if we had a case in Delaware, a hot plant
operator in Delaware, you might have a different problem,
because the hot plant might very "well be crossing the border.
But you. get

the border around southern California

surrounded largely a desert area.
But, again, one can conceive where a hot plant
operator might be crossing State lines.
QUESTION:

Here it did not.

That could be true here in Washington,

the hot plant operator here might deliver both in Virginia and
in Maryland.
MR. LASKY:

He might very well.

That would be a different case.

He might vary well.

Then we’d have at .least one

sale crossing a State line. Then we’d have the counterpart of
Sully-Millar engaged in paving all around here, you'd have
interstate commerce.

That’s a different case.

And the decision we ask the Court to render here is

20

not going to be the last decision it’s going to be asked to -to be rendering on questions like this„
Now, the second vice in the reasoning of the court
below is that it appears to the analogy of the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
That Act. provides for minimum wages»

Not only to

employees engaged in commarce, but also to employees, quote,
"engaged in the production of goods for commerce", end quote»
And this Court, by a divided decision, held that the
last words even meant engaged in the production of goods for
those engaged in commerce, based upon the particular legislative
history of that Act.
Amendments to that Act have added' definitions whereby
if some employees are engaged in commerce or in the production
of goods for commerce, all employees of the same employer are
deemed brought under the Act.
And Congress could do that sort of thing on Robinson™
Patman and Section 3 and unquestionably on Section 7, if it
wished to do.

But it hasn’t done so.

Now, if the Court please, and -this brings me to the
Solicitor General’s line of argument, which I think I can
answer very quickly.
Whenever Congress is called on to legislate, con­
flicting views of politics, economics, sociology are pressed
upon Congress, each one contending for adoption.

And in the

21

end Congress draws a line and makes compromises.
Now, one can grant that legislation is to be given a
scope commensurate with Congress's purposes and aims, but
Congress is the only judge, not only of its goals but of the
millions it wishes to advance them and of the compromises it
wishes to make among the contending factors.
And the only way Congress has to express the solution
and the compromises it is forced to make is in words.
Now, here the words are absolutely clear; not to be
ignored.
In talking about the Sherman Act, this Court, for
example in the South”Eastern ^underwriters case, said the words
of the Sherman Act were all comprehensive, any person who
restrains trade falls under the ban of that Act,
Here we have in the English language a body of terms,
each of separate meaning, each having an ~ with an ascending
order of reach.

We have "in commerce", we have "production of

goods for commerce", we have "production of or working on
instrumentalities of commerce", we have the words "affecting
commerce"; and each one reaches out a little further.
Nov/, the "affecting commerce" reaches out to the
furthest extent of the law.
These words comprise an armory from which Congress
can draw when it wishes to express its particular purpose.
And if the Court is to treat all these words as synonymous, as

22

you're being asked to do by the Solicitor General, I
respectfully submit that corrupts the language, corrupts the
law, and it impoverishes Congress, because it takes away from
Congress words it could use.
And if the Court should hold that the words selected
so carefully by the Legislative Branch, such as "engaged in
commerce", "engaged in the course of commerce", don't mean any
more than "affecting commerce", then Congress is going to be
hard put to express itself when it doesn’t wish to exercise the
commerce power to its fullest extento
It would be driven to circumlocution, negatives and
provisos.
How, everybody knows the legislative

history of the

Robinson-Patman Act demonstrates that Robinson"Patman was the
product of a complex series of legislative proposals, ending
up in compromises that have given many courts headaches- in
trying to resolve the many.
I was quoting at that point from the Mayer Paving
case, in which this Court denied certiorari recently, in 414 U,S,
QUESTION:

When was it enacted?

MR. LASKY:

Robinson-Patman?

In the late Thirties'.

Robinson-Patman was

1936 amendment to Section 2 of Clayton, which was 1914.
QUESTION:

1936?

MR, LASKY:

Approximately, yes? since 1936,

Enacted, incidentally, after this Court, in the Bunts
sc*-»-,

23

Brothers case or the Darby case and the cases involving the
Labor Relations Act, had explicated the far reach of power that
Congress possessed.
No doubt that this Court, at the time Congress
enacted this Act, had told Congress that it had the most
extensive power»

Nevertheless, there was no extension of

change in these words.
Similarly in Celler'-Kefauver, 1951

'50. They

didn't change the words they used in 1934, despite the fact
that they could have, and gone much further.
I submit the case with this submission:

The Congress

of the United States still sits, and if it is the view of the
Department of Justice or others that these three Acts should be
made extensive in their roots with the Sherman Act, they can
go over to Congress and try to get them enacted, and go through
all the debates that will occur before various legislative
committees.
But in a time when we've just been going through a
period when everybody has bean much concerned that the several
departments of the government stay within their own proper
ambit, and at a time like that, that's where they should go,
to Congress not to this Court.

The words of these statutes

are clear.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Counsel, I don’t think we’ll ask you to take a
minute and a half, to divide your argument? we will begin at
