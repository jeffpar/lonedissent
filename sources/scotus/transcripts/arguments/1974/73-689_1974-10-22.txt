PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 73-689 in Maness versus Meyers.
Mr. Walsh, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. WALSH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a $500 fine from a Texas
District Court and in that context, it Is obviously not an
Important case and that is obviously not why this Court
granted certiorari.
The importance of this case is that it involves the
very independence of the American Bar to give free,
untrammeled legal advice to a client who has the right,
should he choose to do so, to follow it or disregard it.
Now, I think perhaps I should make it clear.

I

think it has been made clear in the briefs arid I don’t
know if the Court has seen them.

There is no allegation or

suggestion or suspicion that Mr. Maness, who is a member of
the Bar of this

Court and of the United States Court of

Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and, of course, the Texas
Supreme Court and so on was in any way contumacious in any
personal sense to the trial court.
Actually, there were three lawyers Involved in

4
this case, a Mr. Friedman, nrho is, unfortunately, now
(deceased and a Mr. Maley, who may presently be in the
courtroom.

I don’t know -whether he is.
But three lawyers gave sincere legal advice that

this particular client did not have to produce certain
documents which the state contended were incriminatory and
it is simply a

case of a lawyer being punished for giving

advice on a federal constitutional right and that is what
this case is all about.
Now, we have had a tradition in most countries
since Shipley Adams represented the British soldiers in the
Boston Massacre of laxvyers at least being allowed to
represent and advise their clients and that tradition is
about to be destroyed if this contempt citation stands up
and that is the importance of the case.
Fortunately, it has already been decided once.
I think perhaps the value of my presentation
here is perhaps in discussing the facts rather than the law
because the law has been completely discussed in our briefs.
As a, matter of fact, the case has already been
decided by United States District Court.

If you will

examine Appendix C in our brief on the merits at the
beginning of page

you will find the opinion of Judge

Roberts in Austin dealing with Mr. Maley, who was co-counsel
in the case and it’s a White Horse situation.

There is no

5
difference between the cases.
remedies.

It was simply a choice of

Mr. Haley chose to go the habeas corpus route

through the —~
QUESTION:

And Mr. Maness has chosen to go that

route?
MR. WALSH:

No, Mr. Maness chose to come to the

Supreme Court because he thought that it was important
enough that this Court decide It.
It so happens, your Honor, that both remedies
were available.

You could go the habeas corpus route or

the certiorari route and it was Mr. Maness’ feeling very
strongly that the case was important enough to be decided,
by this Court and I might —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Could he go to Judge Roberts now?
Sir?
Could he go to Judge Roberts now?
Well, I don't know that he could,

having come here.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Sure he could.
But Judge Roberts has decided

Mr. Malay’s case and decided it in what I think is a
simple, lucid, short opinion that it is obvious that a
lawyer has the rip;ht to tell someone that, in his opinion,
you have a right to exercise a constitutional right.
QUESTION:

Is there an appeal pending from

6
Judge Robert’s decision?
HR. WALSH:

Yes, sir, your Honor, it is in the

Fifth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit is holding it in
abeyance pending this Court’s decision of Mr. Maness} case.
QUESTION:

Had this been a criminal right to

counsel case, I suppose the right of the lawyer to express
his views on a constitutional right could be based on the
provision of the Constitution that supports the right of
counsel.
But in a civil proceedings, what is the precise
basis for this?
MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, you understand there was a

criminal prosecution pending -—
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Yes, but this was —
— separately from this.
— this was a civil proceeding.
But had the evidence been made

available in the civil proceedings, it

obviously would

have been made available in the criminal proceedings.
QUESTION:

Well, do you contend that the defendant

In the civil proceedings had a federal constitutional right
to counsel?
MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, he had a constitutional

right to counsel that — yes, I would contend that.

I think

a citizen in any case has a constitutional right if he h&s

7
employed counsel or has a lawyer working for him.

But you

must remember that there was pending a criminal case in the
state courts and that the lawyer's focus was as much
concerned with that pending criminal case as it was with
the civil case, which became the genesis of this action.
QUESTION:

But this was a civil proceeding,

wasn't it?
MR. WALSH:

This was a civil proceeding alleging

the commission of a criminal offense and I noted that this
particular day, according to my latest information, from
Law Week and so on, this Court has before it either having
granted certiorari or applications for
26 cases involving pornography and

certiorari, some

obscenity and I think

in the middle of the trial, when this Court'itself has had
considerable difficulties through the years in determining
the limits and bounds of what is right and what is proper,
with this Court having some 26 cases before it right now,
for a lawyer working in a — a Texas town to do anything
except suggest to a client that he ought to exercise his
rights regarding self-incrimination, I think would probably
be negligence.
Now, we have briefed, in some detail, the merits
of the actual defense of McKelva.

I mean, the merits of

his refusal to produce the information called for by the
subpoena and by the court order and the only reason we have

8
done that — and as a matter of fact, my client, who is a
member of this Bar — we — we have had some disagreements
about the matter but the only reason we have done it is
simply to assure this Court that the advice was given in

.

good faith, that it wasn’t just an effort to avoid legal
process or something of that sort.
QUESTION:

There are cases, are there not — quite

a number of them ■— of witnesses in a civil action, either
parties or independent witnesses refusing on Fifth Amendment
grounds to respond to questions?
MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, the simple remedy for

that and the remedy that was presented by this case — and
it really becomes the funny feature of this case — is that
of course the state district judge had the right, Mr. McKelva
having received his advice from his two lawyers, Mr. McKelva
had the right to disregard the court’s order and thereby be
put in jail for contempt and then it could have been tested
by habeas corpus.
In this case, it was tested by habeas corpus.
Judge Roberts issued a writ for Mr. McKelva and the minute
the state judge learned that the federal court had enter­
tained and granted the writ to bring it under the federal
court, the state judge called Mr. McKelva from the county
jail and said, I am going to let you go.

Your behavior

has been very good and you may be released.

And,

of course,

9
mooted the only traditional way of handling this case,
I don’t think this Court can find a case — we
have, I think, done a decent job of research and I don't
think this Court can find a case where a lawyer has been
put in ja.il for giving noncontumacious advice, just because
a judge happens to think that it contrary to what he wants
done.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t your argument be the same,

despite the fact that as you say, you have briefed the
merits of this question?
MR. WALSH:

W

We wanted you to know it was in good

faith.

:.
QUESTION:

Your argument would be the same,

wouldn’t it, if the advice had turned out to be —- or even
in your opinion was clearly erroneous advice, wouldn’t It?
MR, WALSH:

Erroneous, yes.

Good faith is the

question.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Assuming it was in good faith.
I think I am entitled to make

mistakes in my practice of law without going to jail.

Nov?,

if I am arguing a proposition to you which is not in good
faith, If I am trying to kid the Court, this Court or the
court in Tyler, that is another kettle of- fish and, quite
frankly, I might take a somewhat different position in
that event.

But so long as the legal advice is, in fact,

10
given in good faith and, as I say, in this case we have
tried to demonstrate to you that there are good faith
grounds for believing that the advice was correct.
QUESTION:

What should a judge do in a civil

proceeding when a witness takes the Fifth Amendment and
says he won't answer the question and the judge considers it
and says, well, this just happens to be within the area
that the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to and I direct you
to answer the question.

And the witness says, I’m awfully

sorry, I won’t do it.
MR. WALSH:

That is exactly what.

They put the

man in jail for contempt of court and then, then in Texas
we would have a right to litigate the legality of the
confinement and the —
QUESTION:

What about the lawyer who says, now,

you go ahead and refuse to answer?
MR. WALSH:

Sir, my light is on, but let me say

this, the Appendix clearly shows, and the record clearly
shows that the lawyers did not advise him to
court order.

ignore any

They simply advised him of what they thought

his legal rights were,

answer after lunch, If you want to.
MR. WALSH:
Thank you.

If I may, I would appreciate It,

was taken for* luncheon until 1:02 o’clock p.rrn]
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
continue.

Mr. Walsh, you may

You have about 19 minutes of your time left.
MR, WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it

please the Court:
I have asked the marshal to divide my time in
half so that I may have some time for rebuttal and I just
have a few more remarks I xtfish to make to the Court at
this time.
First, I would like to point out that if Michael
Haness Is guilty of contempt of court for advising a client
about his Fifth Amendment rights, this Court ought to
summon Mr. St. Clair back for advising President Nixon not
to surrender those tapes and hold him In. cchtempt of court.
This is perfect situation of a lawyer giving —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Isn't that Prup?
Prup?

Yes, your Honor.

Let me ask you, was the —- if the judge

rules that Fifth Amendment privilege is not available in a
certain context which is being claimed by a. party or a
witness and Insists that a subpoena be complied with or that
an answer be given to a question and the lawyer advises the
client not to answer, do you suggest that neither the

12

lawyer nor the client is in contempt of court?
MR. WALSH:

No* I didn’t suggest that the client

was not.
QUESTION:

All right, the client is in contempt

of court.
MR. WALSH:

This Court has decided that very

question In Ryan versus United States —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

But the lawyer is not?
No, I think that the lawyer has the

right to give free and untrammeled advice under any
circumstances, as long as it is an honest, professional
opinion.
QUESTION:

Let’s suppose that the client at that

very moment had to write to challenge a judge’s ruling —
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
•— upon appeal.

Instead of disobeying,

he could appeal.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
disobeys.

Yes, sir.
And he chooses not to appeal but

The situation would be different, I suppose.
MR. WALSH;

Your Honor, I would be making a quite

different argument If that were the case, but under the
Texas law as it applies to this particular case, there is
no way to do that.
QUESTION:

So the only way to test a judge's

13
rulinp; Is to be in contempt

and then have the challenge

under the Fifth Amendment ruled on as part of the contempt
proceedings?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.
And either get a stay of that or a

habeas corpus?
MR. WALSH:

Well, your Honor, the lawyers

attempted to obtain habeas corpus relief from both the
Supreme Court for the Texas and the Court of Criminal
Appeals, both of which denied relief.

They then went to

the United States District Court for the Western District
of Texas which granted a writ of habeas corpus and the
minute the federal court granted the writ, the state judge
released the prisioner, thereby mooting the whole case.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Did he fine him?
Sir?
Did he fine him or just wash that case

out?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

He just washed it out.
Is there any dispute between you and

your opponents as to whether there was a procedure in Texas
to challenge this ruling, other than by contempt?
MR. WALSH:

Well, Mr. Zwiener and Mr. Dibrell

can answer that, but I don’t think there is any such
dispute and — am I correct?

14
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Well, I’ll a3k them.
If you would.

I don't believe there

is any way to do it and —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Well, if — excuse me.

Go

ahead.

Well, that is all, your Honor.

I

just did want to suggest that — before I turn this over to
my friends in the Attorney General’s office, I do want to
suggest that we are toying here with the right of a free
American

lawyer to give free and untramraeled legal advice

to a person who is in trouble and that is what is really
involved in this case and I hope the Court will recognize
it in deciding it.
QUESTION:

When you cast it in' that form, of

course, it, at least doesn’t give very much difficulty.
But let me suggest a hypothetical case, just an
ordinary civil lawsuit.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Personal injury or whatever, an

accounting case, and you have a witness, not a party.

If a

party refuses to answer, the Court has many sanctions.

He

can either dismiss the case of the —
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
-— plaintiff or he — the plaintiff’s

counsel can exploit that in argument if it is the defendant.
We’ll lay that aside.

15
A

third party witness and the third party witness

refuses to answer on the grounds that it is self-incrimin­
ation .

Is the court at that point absolutely bound?

Or

can the court make some inquiry into the good faith of the
person?

MR. WALSH:

Your Honors I think the court can

hold the witness in contempt and let the witness exercise
his right to habeas corpus and other relief which is
variable, which is precisely what this Court decided in
Ryan.
QUESTION;

Now let’s more to hid lawyer.

MR. WALSH:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

Now let's more to his lawyer, as in

this case.
MR. WALSH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And the answer of the witness is that,

on advice of counsel,
for these reasons.

naming him, he declines to answer

If you can hypothesize a situation

where the claim is, on its face, utterly frivolous and
unfounded and here you are in the middle or in the process
of a trial, which might have to be declared a mistrial as a
result — there might be many untoward results ~ is the
court totally without power to deal with that situation,
other than contempt of the witness himself?
MR. WALSH:

Well, frankly, I am not at brief to

16
discuss that but my answer would be, just having briefed
the rest of this case, my answer would be yes, he wasn’t
in contempt.
QUESTION:

Just moot against the witness and not

against the lawyer.
MR. WALSH:

I am willing to concede, your Honor,

that there are peculiar circumstances that I can conceive
of where the lawyer’s advice would be so frivolous that
perhaps the court could take

disciplinary action, but I

don’t think by way of contempt.

I think the way would be

through the grievance procedure and something of that sort.
QUESTION:

Take disciplinary action or refer It,

depending on —
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
The rules of the jurisdiction, ref ex­

MR. WALSH:

the state was correct in its contention that it was contra­
band, it seems to

me they should also say that the man has

the right to refuse to produce it.
Thank you, your Honors.
QUESTION:

Sir, supposing that instead of the

attorney's objection and advice being based on Fifth
Amendment grounds, this came up in the course of a
proceeding where his client was on the stand, his client,
say, was the defendant in a civil action and he is being
cross-examined and the other lawyer asks him a question and
his lawyer objects on the grounds of hearsay and the trial
court overrules the objection and tells the client who is
on the witness stand to answer the question and then the
lawyer says, very politely, "Just a minute, your Honor, I
am telling my client not to answer that question."'
Now, there is no constitutional issue involved
there.

Would you say that case is
MR. WALSH:

different from yours?

Your Honor, yes, I would say it is

18
different because of the pendency of the criminal proceedings
against this man and so ons but I would go a little further.
Firsts if the client wishes

to follow his lawyer’s

advice and the lawyer says, "Don’t answer that question»" I
don’t care what the .judge says, he chooses to follow it, he
goes to jail and that may be tested in the proper appellate
remedy, as was suggested in Ryan.
Now, just a moment, your Honor.

The next thing

is if it is totally frivolous information that the lawyer
has given the client.

If it is stupid advice, we do have

laws involving malpractice where the client has remedy
against the lawyer,
QUESTION:

I thought your argument was based,

though, on the idea that this was advice about a consti­
tutional claim?
MR. WALSH:

That’s right.

That is involved in

this case, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well,, but in my example, it is simply

a question of whether it is hearsay and whether he is re­
quired to answer in a normal course of interrogation of a
witness.

Wouldn’t you draw a rather sharp distinction?
MR. WALSH:

I have been drawing a sharp enough

distinction so that I am sort of unwilling to answer your
question.
QUESTION:

Well, is this —

IS
MR. WALSH:

Because it isn’t involved in this

case.
QUESTION:

Well, is the free and untr amine led

right of a lawyer to give legal advice something that exists
quite apart from the subject on which he is advising?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

I think so.
And in the courtroom, he —
No, not competely free on the subject

on which he is advising, no, I don’t think that is so at all.
QUESTION:

But regardless of whether the subject

he is advising on is a constitutional right or not, you
feel that in a courtroom, a lawyer has a right to give
free and untrammeled legal advice?
HR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

I do.
And what is the source in the

Constitution for that claim?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

The constitutional right to counsel.
He doesn’t have a right—™
He has a constitutional right, for

instance, to a jury trial on anything involving more than

$20.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

But that is —
And that is involved in the

constitutional right to have counsel represent you.
QUESTION:

But that is a Seventh Amendment right

20
that is conferred on litigants in federal court.

But you

were in state court.
MR. WALSH:

Well,

I would be prepared to contend

that the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses the right to trial
by — the right to assistance of counsel in civil courts„
if you happen to have counsel and he is there and -— as
these lawyers were.

Whether you have the right to

appointed counsel, as we do in criminal cases, is another
kettle of fish but, certainly, if you have a lawyer there,
and he gives you the advice and you follow it, I think that
is your risk and your remedy is against the lawyer.
QUESTION:

There is nothing the judge can do

about it?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Yes, he can put the client in jail.
Nothing the judge can do to the

lawyer?
MR. WALSH:

’Well, I have seen one case in my own

home federal district where the lawyers asserted a claim of
privilege as to the communication that was made to them by
the client and Judge Connally took the position, fine, I'm
going to hold you in contempt of court if you don’t answer
the question, and. he said that if you are right, you can
revert.

But you understand, this was the lawyer directly

claiming a privilege of his own.

This is not advising a

client, as we have in this case and Judge Connally*s

21
position was , well., I am going to hold you in contempt and
if you want it in the Supreme Court or the Fifth Circuit
or anywhere else, that is fine, but I am not going to
reduce the sentence at the end of 120 days.

But that is a

different situation.
Mow, I think the lawyer has a certain degree of
immunity and I think it is up to this Court to protect it.
QUESTION:

And your position would be the same if

there was an injunction outstanding against the painty and
the lawyer advised him not to — he thought the injunction
was invalid and he just advised him to disobey it?
MR. WALSH:

Well, your Honor, I would hope that I

would advise him to appeal the injunction.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but what if you didn't?

You advised him to disobey it?
MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, if there Whs judicial

relief available, it would be a different kettle of fish.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Well, that —
But in this case there is no judicial

relief available.
QUESTION:

Isn’t that a critical point in your

entire argument?
MR. WALSH:

I think it is an important point.

Whether it is critical or not, I don't know, but it
certainly is an important issue and I agree with you that

22

the Court needs to consider it but the fact remains that
in this case there was no relief available, other than the
relief that was actually granted by the United States
district judge and was there after it mooted by the state
judge when he realized that he was going to get into
federal court.
And that is the peculiar reason for this whole
case.
I would like very much to keep some of my time
and unless the Court has other questions — and turn it
over to my friends from the Attorney General’s office.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Very well,

Mr. Walsh.
MR. WALSH:

Thank you, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dibrell.

OBAL ARGUMENT OF JOE B. DIBRELL, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DIBRELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before starting into my point, I would like to,
I think, clear the record with reference to the matter in
the way this case came here.

I think that there Is no

evidence or insufficiency of evidence on the question
concerning the fact that the attorney did, in fact,
advise McKelva, the witness, not to produce the magazines

23

that were subpoenaed.

There is no question that he advised

them further the second time not to produce them and
actually that this advice was what was followed and what
Judge Clawson held to be compensable on the part of the
witness as well as the attorneys.
I think, as pointed out on page 14 of the
Petitioner’s brief, that they want — I am sure that there
is no question about the jurisdiction or about the fact
that the actual advice had been given to disobey the trial
judge's order to produce the material.
QUESTION:

Is there any information as to why

he dropped the charges against the party and didn;t drop
them against the lawyer?
MR. DIBRELL:
your Honor.

McKelva served seven days in jail,

They were not dropped.

He actually served.

It was a ten-day criminal contempt sentence and he served
seven of those days and the judge released him three days
early and at the time —
QUESTION:

Well, did he give any relief to the

lawyers?
MR. DIBRELL:

Well, of course, relief for the

lawyer, under the Article 1911(a) of the Texas statute,
your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall, the — before the
attorney can actually be held in contempt, actually have
to pay a fine or serve time in jail when the contempt has

been asserted by the judge, another judge must come in and
preside over the matter and hear the matter somewhat as a
review to — and make an independent judgment as to whether
to uphold the contempt of the attorney.

This was done in

this case by Judge Meyers.
QUESTION:

But as soon as the federal court

moved, they turned the defendant loose.
MR. DIBRELL:

That was

before the writ — or

denied —* my understanding, as I recall it, before the writs
were denied by the Supreme Court of Texas or the Court of
criminal appeals with reference to the ---- not to McKelva,
but with reference to — the ~~ this — the contempt,
actually, of the lawyers as far as making a final
determination occurred long after the mootness of the
McKelva contempt.
QUESTION:

It did?

MR. DIBRELL:

Yes, your Honor, because the

attorneys had not had their review by Judge Meyers under
the Texas procedure where the attorneys —
QUESTION:

I’m not talking -- I'm talking about

the judge, the original trial judge, his original action.
He didn’t

that’s straight he didn't touch it at all as

to the lawyer but he did as to the attorneys.
MR. DIBRELL:

I think under 1911(a)s once he made

the decision, your Honor, he no longer had the decision to

25
do it.

I think it is now up to Judge Meyers,to another

judge who is assigned.

Judge Clawson no acts or has control

of the contempt of the lawyers at that point.
I think once he had made the adjudication, then
to whether or not it is going to be upheld or whether they
are going to be in contempt or not would be determined by
the judge who was assigned to make that determination.
QUESTION:

Well, my other question is, when a

the jargon most states use, that on the advice of counsel
I claim the Fifth Amendment?
Do they use that jargon in Texas?
MR. DIBRELL:

They have on occasions, your

Honor and
QUESTION:

They have on occasions?

MR. DIBRELL:

Yes, they have on occasions, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Did MeKelva go up

through the — try

to get a review of his contempt conviction in the stati
system?
MR. DIBRELL:

He had to make an application to

the state before we could have, I think, had jurisdiction
for Judge Roberts.

I think he had actually made an

application to the Court of Criminal Appeals and to the
Supreme Court as well.

I don't think there was any question

26
about perhaps there was jurisdiction by Judge Roberts to
initially grant the writ as far as not having exhausted
state remedy.
QUESTION:

So you did not get a review because

he was released before there

was an opportunity to go into

that?
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

That is right, your Honor.

There was a subpoena issued for

magazines and then there a motion to quash, wasn't there?
MR. DIBRELL:

There was a motion to quash, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:

And that was what was argued before

the judge?
MR. DIBRELL:

Well, the argument, the motion

contained one thing that the magazines were not owned by
the defendant and the property interest —
QUESTION:

But it was also asserted Fifth

Amendment?
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

The judge overruled the motion to quash

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

It was also asserted Fifth Amendment

Re overruled, yes.

Now, under Texas procedure, could that

decision have been appealed?
MR. DIBRELL:
unless

I think that

No, no, not that part of it.

Not

27
QUESTION:

So there was no remedy.

There was no

remedy at that point to protect the materials claimed to be
protected by the Fifth Amendment except not produce them
and argue that on contempt.
MR. DIBRELL:

I think that the remedy, of course,

that we want to get, and my principal argument first -QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

What, sir?

Is that right or not?

Was there or wasn’t there some other remedy?
MR. DIBRELL:
sure.

Well, perhaps it might — I’m not

I don’t think it is

developed in the state policy

I don’t know that they would actually be

prohibitive of trying to obtain an appellate judge's
mandamus if a judge —
QUESTION:

But the denial of the motion couldn’t

be appealed under Texas proceedings?
MR. DIBRELL:

Not at that point.

Actually, just

the denial of the motion to quash the subpoena at that point.
That’s right.
QUESTION:

And you don’t know whether or not --

MR. DIBRELL:

He had not yet held them in contempt

yet, either , at that point, your Honor.
QUESTION:

And you don’t know whether or not

mandamus was available?

28
MR. DIBRELL:

Mo, I do not.

I would like to point out very — right at the
beginning here that the

Respondent is not in a position

here to urge a decision in any way that would actually
destroy or diminish or dilute the witness’ right to assert
a Fifth Amendment privilege or even a right of a counsel to
give legal advice to its effects.
Really, what the Respondent is here and what we
are seeking and urging upon this Court is some validation
of the tools of the trial judges to compel the order of
proceedings of the matter that is before him.
I think it is Respondent’s, really, contention
here that it is the judge and not the lawyer who must be
the final arbiter of such matters and, as to the suppression
of evidence or claim of privilege subject to review as the
trial proceedings can go on in due course and I readily
admit that the conduct of counsel here was not contumacious
but I think it is clear that it was contentious in the sense
that it did actually counsel a disobedience of the trial
judge's order for the production of these matters.
QUESTION:

Well, what if that order had been

directed, as I think Mr. Justice

White suggested, to a

question submitted to the witness while he was on the stand
in the course of trial and he declined to answer on the
grounds that the response might tend to incriminate him?

29
Would you think that the lawyer could be held in contempt
for so advising him?
MR. DIBRELL:

No, your Honor, not until such time

as the judge specifically said, you go ahead and answer the
question and then if the lawyer persists in telling him, I
think it is at that point, it is the witness' determination
to make that determination, whether he wants to be held in
contempt, go ahead and suffer the consequences of being
held in contempt or —
QUESTION:

Isn't that the normal — isn't that the

ordinary route to test it?

As it is under '«She federal

system under Rule 17?
MR. DIBRELL:

Yes, it is, your Honor.

Now, this

might not be a normal means, but by the same token, if we
give this absolute right, it would — and I think that the -if the Court is going to sanction the action form of the
counsel or just to actually disobey the court's order in
that point and not be held in some obedience to following
the court's order, I think it has already been pointed out
in other areas of disobeying an orderc of the court, the
courts are turned into boards of arbitration.
QUESTION:

How far do you carry that, Mr. Dibrell?

Suppose -— getting back to the question my brother Marshall
asked — the response was, on advice of counsel, respect­
fully refused on grounds of self-incrimination and the judge

30
says,"Well, I don’t honor that.

You answer." And the

answer was,"We11, I'm sorry, your Honor, on advice of counsel
I respectfully refuse to produce it on the grounds of self­
incrimination. "
Now, in that circumstance, would the lawyer who
had given the advice — would he have been in the difficulty
that this lawyer is?
MR. DIBRSLL:

I think he would, yes, your Honor.

I think, if I understand your question right —
QUESTION:

I am speaking of before he ever takes

the stand, he consults an attorney and the attorney tells
him, "No, if you are asked to produce it, you just say that
under advice of counsel you are not producing it and pleading
the privilege against self-incrimination."
MR. DIBRELL:

No, at that point, no, I don't think

so.
QUESTION:

Not at that point.

All right, now, the

judge says, "Well, I don't agree with you and I order you to
produce it."

And the witness says again, "I am sorry, but on

the advice of counsel, I refuse to produce them."
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:
would

That is not the facts in this case.

I know it is not.

But

I am asking you,

the lawyer be in the same difficulty that

Mr. Maness is?
MR. DIBRELL:

No, I do not think so.

31
QUESTION:

Well, then, why is Mr. Mane3s In the

difficulty he is in?
MR. DIBRELL:

I think because the feeling and the

frustration upon the part of the trial judge in this
proceeding; where, first of all, he denied the motion to
quash the subpoena.

Then he asked counsel — he did not

want to hold McKelva In Csontempt of court at this point.
He says, "I want to give you an opportunity to produce these
magazines that have been subpoenaed.

How much time would

you like?"
Counsel replied here, "Well, you will have to
make that

determination, your Honor.

We can't suggest it

should be even ten days, we still would not produce them."
Nevertheless, the court recessed 'until 1:00 o'clock
and to permit the production of the magazines in obedience to
his order.
QUESTION:

And the lawyer persisted in the advice

he had initially given.
MR. DIBRELL:

That is right, persisted in it.

It is his second persistence in it that we — that the
Respondent feels was contemptible
QUESTION:

on the part of counsel.

Is the lawyer frustrating the judge or

the Fifth Amendment frustrating him?
MR. DIBRELL:

I don’t think the Fifth Amendment

was — he was frustrated, of course, in the facts of this

32

case, obviously.

I think that the briefs that we filed and

the facts that I think -— your decision in Beilis —
actually in analysis of Boyd, I think that clearly, as far
as the actual facts of this case, McKelva did not have a
right to assert the Fifth Amendment.

QUESTION:

There is something about the Fifth

Even though it is a civil proceeding, if

I think that Mr. Justice Black

That is

criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:

You mean, that would be subject to a

33
motion to suppress?
MR. DIBRELL:

Yes, well, he could still have his

motion to suppress the evidence later on.
QUESTION:

On the grounds that he was compelled to

produce it against his will?
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you think that is enough protection?

MR. DIBRELL:

I think that what this Court needs

to help decide is, to keep the balance a balance of what the
■c

right of the people and the right of the court to ultimately
have all of the facts brought forth in a proceedings so
that the proceeding and criminal proceeding obviously —
Fifth Amendment privileges, other constitutional rights.
It is the responsibility and duty of the Court to
take these witnesses and parties as well, but that -- I
think that what is necessary and what would be helpful in
this area is that vie could go ahead and actually have the
prophylactic rule adopted, as suggested by the lateral
rules of evidence ~~ the fact that this would be, you
actually would have this amenity.

You go ahead and produce

it and you would have this amenity from actual to criminal
prosecution, using the criminal prosecution as part of it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dibrell, let me see if

position is what I think it is.

your

I take it you have conceded

all along that this Mr. Maness could advise his client

34
Initially —
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes,

To take the Fifth.

And then, the court

having ruled, I take it that you feel that what he should
advise the client in,"In my judgment, you have the right to
take the Fifth, but if you do, you may go to jail but I, as
a lawyer, have to advise you to obey the orders of the
c ourfc."
Isn’t this essentially xfhat you are saying at this
point?
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

And that, I take it you feel, Is

different than to persist in advising the client to take the
Fifth?
MR. DIBRELL:

I think so.

to make some determination

Once the court has had

at least, once he has had to

be the arbitor of this particular matter of the proper
assertion of the Fifth Amendment or not, what I am ----- I think
trial court,s, all trial courts need, at least have the -— as
far as possible to make sure there is a free judgment call
as possible to protect the rights of the witness who Is
claiming a privilege, as well as to protect the rights of
the parties who are entitled to have the information come
into the trial.
QUESTION:

The court could be wrong, though.

35
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I’ve seen lawyers — tie'll all

knox-m instances, certainly, or we think we have known—
MR. DIBRELL:

That’s right, yes, your Honor,

and I think what we need is to cut down as much as possible
the error upon the part of the trial judge.
QUESTION;

Well, what if the client is told to

produce the second time and he says, ’’May I talk to my
attorney?”
The judge says all right and

he talks to the

attorney and he asks the attorney, "Is the judge right?”
and the attorney says, ’’Well, in my judgment, he is wrong.”
"Well, how can we test it?”
And the attorney says, "Just refuse to answer
him and we’ll test it out in contempt proceedings, but you
are going to be held in contempt, but if you want to test
it out, I advise you to —
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

The suggestion that I would make.

"The only way you cari test it out is

to refuse to produce it.
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

We can test it out that way."
I would —

That would be a rather normal

conversation, wouldn’t it?
MR. DIBRELL:

If I can get — I think that your

question hits to one part, I hope, Mr. Justice White,

in that what is needed., I think, as far as trial judge is
concerned, recognizing that they are the protectors of the
rights of the witnesses and all the parties, at least to
have an in camera examination of documents which had been
subpoenaed to make a better determination and perhaps would
even urge that some in chambers inquiry up to a point as to
what the testimony
QUESTION:

—
Well, the point is, Mr. Dibrsll

suppose —• suppose in this instance, Mr. Maness had said,
’’All right, you’d better obey,51 and so he surrendered the
documents, he had possession of them.
And the next day there is a misdemeanor charge
under your Section 3 that for having possession with intent
to distribute any obscene matter.
I gather that, on the strength of what he
surrendered, even though his lawyer thought he did not
have to surrender it, but just to obey the judge he
surrendered them, I guess he could go to jail, couldn’t he?
MR. DIBRELL:

You are talking about an involuntary

surrender.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly, that is what I am

talking about, in response to the —
MR. DIBRELL:

I think at that time he could move

to suppress the -QUESTION:

Is it established law that he could

37
suppress In those circumstances in Texas?
MR. DIBRELL:

Well, I think that Texas is under

the same rulings of this Court as any other state court in
the sense that I think this Court has ruled that you can
still -- has found that you can still move to suppress
evidence.
QUESTION:

We find that sometimes some of

these

things are not always followed in the state courts, so my
question is, is in Texas, in the state court proceedings,
is It accepted

law that the involuntary production would

enable him to suppress it as evidence at a subsequent
criminal trial?
MR. DIBRELL:

I can't cite you to a case, your

Honor but my hunch would be, yes, that it would be.
QUESTION:

It Isn’t, perhaps, quite enough for

the man to know that ulitmately, In the federal court, he
might be vindicated If, in fact, it would be incriminating
to him -- or tend to be incriminating in the state court
system.

Isn't that correct?
MR. DIBRELL :

I don't think that he would —

frankly, I don't think that the state courts have had the
point where he would — I don't think that they would say
that he would have this right, any more than he would in
the federal system.
QUESTION:

Well, then, doesn't that tend to give

38
some color of validity to the lawyer’s advice.
If you can’t answer that it is established Texas
law that that would be subject to a motion to suppress and
to a successful outcome, then doesn’t that justify a lawyer
telling him not to produce?
MR. DIBRELL:

I think that frankly, that the

state court would sustain a motion to suppress.

But I

cannot cite you to a case.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the lawyer had said to

the client exactly what you have just said —
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— to the Court?

That""I think.”

If the client , during a recess, then, asked him the question
and he said. "I think, but I can’t cite any case, that it
will be subject to a motion to suppress”?
MR. DIBRELL:

We11,your

Honor, there again, I

think the contempt here is the actual very — to go ahead
and actually disobey, not just giving advice as to what
might be the consequences.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dibrell, on your — you say the

only way to try it out is to go to jail?
MR. DIBRELL:

This is what Mr. Ross has indicated,

that he let his client go to jail,
QUESTION:
and you

WE11, if that is the only way to do it,

say that is one way of trying it out and the judge

39
puts both the lawyer and the client in jail, how do you
get it tried' while they are in jail?
MR. DIBRELL:

Both.

Well, of course, in this case, the

judge did not put them both in jail until he’d — you don’t
get the trial.
QUESTION:

Well, you say he should have put them

in.
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

What, sir?

Could he

have given him ten days,

his lawyer?
MR, DIBRELL:

He gave him ten days, but he could

not then put the lawyer in jail.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. DIBRELL:

Because another judge has to come

in and hear the matter.
QUESTION:

Why not ?

MR. DIBRELL:

Because Article 1911(a) of the

Texas statute provides that an officer of the court of the
attorney who is held in contempt by a judge, that judge
must let another judge come in and preside over the matter.

So then he, say that judge says, "Go to

How do you litigate that?
MR. DIBRELL:

Well, you’d have to litigate it

by a writ of habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

IN jail?

40
MR. DIBRELL:

Well, he would be brought forth to

litigate in court.
QUESTION:

Well, what is that to the Fifth

Amendment in a civil proceeding in Texas, other than the
judge's unfettered discretion?
MR. DIBRELL:

I don't think it is any more

unfettered discretion than any judge in the trial of any
proceedings, he has got to consciously follow the -— what he
understands what, actually, the law is.

He is under the

same commands of the federal as anyone else in the matter of
constitutional law and preserving and protecting the rights
of witnesses or parties.

talking about.
MR. DIBRELL:

Yes, and the Fifth Amendment.

Are you advised that the lawyer might

I understood you to say you

one.

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

A case to suppress evidence?

In these circumstances.

MR. DIBRELL:

In these circumstances.

No, I cannot give you a case, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather the trial judge

indicated that it would be.

On page 11 of the Petitioner's

42
brief is a colloquy.

I think that is what it means.

The

trial court said, "Which could have been reached by a motion
to suppress that evidence or by an objection to an attempt
to introduce it."
Now, I don’t know what law the trial court was
remarking on, but I take it that is what he was referring
to.
MR. DIBRELL:

Judge Clawson was taking this

attitude.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Thank you.

Well, he is saying that it could be

Does that mean —- is that an assurance that, when

reached, it would be granted?
MR. DIBRELL:

I think it was an assurance by this

Court in this proceeding that it could be reached by that
name.
QUESTION:

That wasn't the trial judge, was it?

This is the second judge, isn't it?
QUESTION:

No, it's the trial judge.

QUESTION:

I can't make out —

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

No, that is the trial judge.

That's the trial judge?

You are sure about that?
QUESTION:

It is Judge Clawson, If you look at the

43
bottom of page 8, I think.

It begins with Judge Clawson

and then carries on through pages 9S 10 and 11.
MR. DIBRELL:

Yes, it is Judge Clawson, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dibrell, what is the normal Texas

procedure when someone is found in contempt during the
course of a trial for that person tfho is himself on a
contempt to obtain appellate review in the state system?
MR. DIBRELL:

By writ of habeas corpus to the

state court, state appellate court.
QUESTION:

And would McKelva, the client, a witness

here, was he In a position to seek habeas corpus had he
gone to jail too, or had he been sentenced for contempt by
Judge Clawson?
MR. DIBRELL:

He was sentenced for criminal

contempt of ten days and —
QUESTION:

By Judge Clawson?

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

By Judge Clawson, yes, your Honor.

And he sought the state habeas corpus,

did he not?
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

All the way up.

MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Sought the state habeas corpus.

All the way up.

And if the Texas Court of Criminal

Appeals or the Supreme Court had thought his claim

44
meritorious —
MR. DIBRELL:

They could have granted it.

QUESTION:

They could have granted It.

QUESTION:

Well, I misunderstood.

I thought you

told us a few minutes ago that he was released from custody
before he had an opportunity to get a review of his
contempt?
MR. DIBRELL:

No, he had already made this before

he had a review by the federal district judge.
QUESTION:

I misunderstood you.

We are talking about McKelva now?
MR. DIBRELL:

Yes,'McKelva.

No, he had already

been refused by the state court.
QUESTION:

And then, in effect, the judge’s

ruling sustained that?
MR. DIBRELL:

That’s right.

QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:

And so that if he had turned the

magazines over, he could never have had that review?
Because he never vrould have been held In
contempt.
MR. DIBRELL:
held in contempt.

That’s right, he would not have been

He would have been obeying the judge’s

order at that point.
QUESTION:

Sorry to track over it again, but the

judge's statement at page 11 of your brief' ™
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

Of Petitioner’s brief, your Honor?

Yes, right near the top of the page

where the court said, "Referring to the action, the com­
pulsory production, that it could have been reached by a
motion to suppress that evidence or by an objection to an
attempt to introduce it,"
Now, you say that you can’t cite any case In which
the Texas courts have held that it is — that motion would
be successful because of the depression exerted by the
power of the subpoena.
Is the court saying any more than pointing out the
standard routine remedy, you can always make a motion?
MR. DIBRELL:

1 think yes, your Honor, he is

pointing out here that, actually, at this point of the
subpoena deuces tecum, there is no record, there is no books
or anything else.

The court has not even had an opportunity

to make an in camera examination to rule on the admissibility
of them by having to see, to actually make a judgment call
in that sense of incrimination or anything else.
All he has is the motion and the raising of the
assertion of the privilege by counsel and I think that the
trial judge here was trying ■— was pointing out to counsel
that if I turn these over to the city attorney, who has
asked for the court to subpoena these magazines, at that

i|6
point you can object to their being introduced by the city
attorneys raising the grounds and to still have a review of
that and appeal later as to whether or not , if I do admit
them, you can object to it.

You can have a review by the

appellate court to determine whether I made a correct
judgment or not.
If it's my view that they should be suppressed or
your objection is good, they do not come into this trial.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the scope of the Fifth

Amendment incrimination clause?

Does it mean that you can

only use it if you are certain to be convicted of something,
or does it mean that you can assert the Fifth Amendment
right if it will expose you to prosecution?
MR. DIBRELL:

Well, I think that this Court has

already determined that it is very personal, has to be very
personal in its claim and it must be asserted for, as I
think

as I read the decisions and I understand the

decisions, going to the actual privacy of the person,
either his effects, his papers and, of course, also his
testimony which might be — is obviously personal to him
if it incriminates him.
QUESTION:

But that doesn’t quite answer my

question.
MR. DIBRELL:
QUESTION:

In

All right, sir.
Texas, as the Texas courts apply

'47
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, is it necessary
to show, in order to assert it successfully, that you are
bound to be convicted?

Or is it enough to show that you are

likely to be prosecuted?
MR, DIBRELL:

Mo, 1 don’t think that you have to

show that you are bound to be convicted.

No, I think that

it is enough to show that you might be prosecuted,

I think

that — I don’t think there is any difference in the fact
that it might be ■— you have got to show that there is
obviously some incrimination.

Otherwise, I don’t think that

there is proper assertion under the Fifth Amendment
privilege.
QUESTION:

Let’s order our facts a little.

Assume

\ ‘V;

that there was no criminal proceeding pending in this case
and he declined to produce on the advice of counsel who
said, "If you do produce, then you are very likely to be
prosecuted."

Would that be a — would you regard that as

a good, valid claim that should be recognized by the Texas
court?
MR. DIBRELL:
because

I don’t see the distinction there

whether there was possible some criminal prose­

cution pending, or civil, I think that still he has got a
duty to produce these particular magazines in this case.
My time is up, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Dibrell,

Every time I have to go down to the police station

at midnight and tell a client, "By George, you have a Fifth
Amendment right not to talk to the police," I guess I am

But the fact is that the advice given in this
case was obviously sound.
careful pleadings.

It was obviously founded on

It, I think, is totally sustained by

a breach.
But I don’t think that Is the key issue in this
case.

I think the key issue is the right of a lawyer to

give advice and this Court, in Ryan, lias made it very clear
that there is a conventional, easy, simple way to pursue
this matter and handle it and in answer to the question that
was asked from the bench, first, I'd like to point out that
at page -— I believe it is ^1 of the Appendix, the Court of
Criminal Appeals of Texas simply denied the motion for
leave to file an original application for habeas corpus
as to McKelva.
The Supreme Court of Texas did the same and both
of those notations are at pap;e *11 of the Appendix.
QUESTION:

And did all that happen within seven

49
days?
MR. WALSH:

Yes, they moved fast, your Honor and

did everything they could for their client but they then
received the writ of habeas corpus from Judge Roberts and it
was on that day — as a matter of fact while they were hand­
carrying the writ of habeas corpus from Judge Roberts to the
State District Court.
He apparently lea.rned of it through some informant
which we honestly do not know and he had the man brought
over from the county jail and dismissed the charge against
him and, of course, that mooted the federal habeas corpus
as to the client.
QUESTION:
wasn't it?

And this was a criminal contempt,

It wasn't civil contempt.
MR, WALSH:

your Honor.

Well, he was in contempt of court,

I am not sure how •—

QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Well, anyhow, ten days certain.
Yes and that was what was given the

lawyers, too.
QUESTION:

And the lawyers also had ten days.

MR. WALSH:

And as Mr. Dibrell has said, the

reviewing judge changed the jail sentence as to the lawyer --as to both Mr, Maley and Hr. Maness to a $500 fine but, of
course, on

nonpayment of the fine, they are subject to.

going to jail.

QUESTION:
MR. WALSII:

Yes.
And there is what I think, a

perfectly sound opinion from Judge Roberts, that is,
Exhibit C of our brief on the merits.
Judge Roberts Is from Texas.

He knows what goes

on and how it goes on and, quite frankly, I don’t think
this Court could do any better than to simply adopt
Judge Roberts' opinion as to both parties.
QUESTION:

Now, I see Judge Meyers' opinion.

Where is —
I1R. WALSH:

No, Judge Roberts' opinion, your

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Oh, Judge Roberts, yes, on the habeas
I believe it is Exhibit C.

Yes, at

page 7-! of our brief on the merits.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSII:
QUESTION:

All right.
And Judge —
Isn’t there a normal procedure In

Texas for granting immunity when the state wants testimony
that it is going to be in the —
MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, we have several incoming

statutes on immunity in various kinds of cases.
QUESTION:

But you normally, the prosecutor or

judge or somebody has to make it clear to the witness or to
the party that — that removes the danger.

MR. WALSH:

Well, yes, and furthermore, I might

point out that the idea that Mr. Dibrell suggested to the
Court, I accord with.

I think Chief Justice Burger had his

fingers on it.
If this were released, even after advice of
counsel, there would be a serious question in my mind as a
defense lawyer, whether it wasn’t voluntarily released.
I mean, yes. if you actually hit the guy over the
head and take something away from him, there is no problem,
but if it is your decision not to contest a court judgment
and simply accept it and bring those materials into court,
there is a serious question in my mind as to whether that
is not a voluntary surrender and therefore, your right to
stippress may indeed be restricted.
I simply bring back the Court?s attention to that.
I have used most of my time.

Unless the Court

has further questions., I’d like to thank the Court for its
attention and for the privilege of being here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Walsh.

Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:48 o’clock p.ra., the case was
submitted.]
