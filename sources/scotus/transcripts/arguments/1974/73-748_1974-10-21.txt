Mr. Schulman, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SCHULMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SCHULMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I find myself back again in a return voyage, it
appears like„ on behalf of Merchant Seamen.

Of course,

Initially I was* here in behalf of questions of their rights
under the Federal Labor Act and we have" an additional
point today which is presented to the Court of the Free
•'r '*:•'**■
/> f;

Speech First Amendment rights.

|

We had intended to devote substantial time to
both arguments.

However, in the light of an: ur;fortunate

repetition by the Solicitor General., again1,-’'without leave
of this Court and for submitting an untimely'‘brief, as he
did in Windward, we are going tc be compelled to devote a
little more time to the presemption argument than we had
originally contemplated.
Present here, as distinguished from the Windward
case, where, in Windward, the claim was by the ship upon
shipowner.

4
The conduct of the unions there interfered with
the ship's contract among its seamen and its internal
relations and for that reasons this Court determined that
it fell within the parameters of the Burns Doctrine where
the Act was not applicable.
Now, we have a totally different picture here.
In this instance, the Association of Mobile Stevedoring
Employers brought the action in the Alabama State Court
alleging almost the verbatim practical provisions of Section
8B4 of the Act that these pickets had directed their
activities to the stevedore employees of the Association,
caused them to breach their agreements, induced them not to
go to work upon this foreign vessel and claimed at that
time that, therefore, they were entitled to an injunction.
Now, when we look at both the complaint of the
Respondent ■— there is an additional Respondent in this
case and there is an additional Respondent, I don't want to
forget him, a farmer who had some produce complained that
his right to do business was interfered with insofar as the
Longshoremen wouldn’t load his grain aboard the vessel, or
unload his grain to put aboard the vessel.
When we look at the final analysis of what has
happened

in the factual context of this case, you have the

Alabama State Court, not passing upon the merits in the
Windward case of the internal economy of the vessel, the

foreign seamen, their contract with their shipowner, but,
on the contrary you have the Alabama court regulating the
employer-employee relations existing between the Longshoremen
American Association Employer and its employees and the
American Seamen Unions and I say, in that respect, this is
conduct when you examine

the

Congressional scheme which

was left exclusively to the competence of the Labor Board.
Now, there are many illustrations of this pattern
of conduct.

It is not unique.

There are many areas where,

under the congressional scheme as determined by this
Court and so applied, where the underlying dispute, the
causes of dispute, the primary dispute is without the
competence of the board.
Nevertheless, other aspects of the dispute remain
within the sole and exclusive authority — and I'd like to
just comment on a few of them, if I may.
Now, for example, the Broome-Hattiesburg case
where in that instance the Labor Board had determined on
the standards of commerce that the
did not meet the

parties in that instance

requirements, the quotient for commerce

and determined under those circumstances that there was no
jurisdiction over the primary dispute, there was no
commerce.
Nevertheless, this Court held in that case that
conduct complained of •— the secondary conduct within the

6
Congressional scheme of regulating conduct of American
employers and American unions were within the exclusive
province of the Board and we have had three cases in Maritime
to the effect — and Mr. Chief Justice may recall one of
them.

He heard one of the arguments in the Gralnhandlers

ease against the NLRB.
The first one, however, comes out of the Fourth
Circuit and you get the identical pattern that

Longshore­

men in that case in Local 1^38 NLRB, the Longshoremen in
that particular case were picketing the vessel, claiming
political reasons.

But one of the issues presented there

was whether or not the Board, in this instance, because it
was a foreign flag ship owner, had competence to process
such a complaint or such a challenge.
And the circuit held yes.

Now, what the conduct

there complained of and what the conduct the Board was
seeking to remedy was not the internal affair of the vessel,
pointing out clearly that that Is what Benz, Incres, and
McCulloch had stood for at that posture and time.

But on

the contrary, the relationship existing among American
employers, among American unions and American workers.
Now the sea context came up within the D. C.
circuit and in the Seventh Circuit involving Canadian
vessels.

It ame out of the same context, one at a pre­

liminary injunction stage and one at an enforcement of the

7
Board’s order and in those cases, the unions in both
instances took the following position:
They said,

Look, the underlying dispute involved

here is one involving a Canadian foreign flag vessel, a
Canadian shipowner foreign flag and I draw that distinction
quite clearly between a foreign flag ship and a foreign
shipowner.
In that instance —
QUESTION:

Has the Court made that distinction?

MR. SCHULMAN:

As I read Windward, the Court

talks about foreign shipowner.
QUESTION:

Well, have we ever made the sharp

distinction that you are making —
MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

No, no.

— between foreign flags and foreign

owners ?
MR. SCHULMAN:
sharp distinction.
QUESTION:

No, I don't think there is any

I am speculating.
On the Jones Act context we talked

about it.
MR. SCHULMAN:

On the Jones Act, yes, and on the

Rhoditis you have.
QUESTION;

That- is sort of —

MR. SCHULMAN:

This Court has and also, under

Rhoditis, the comments directed by Mr. Justice Harlan

about

McCulloch., you can’t have this evaluation, this balancing,
nevertheless, the Rhoditis majority apparently did not
accept that and directed no comments to it and, again, I
assume that they paid attention and disagreed.
No, I think they are talking about, Mr. Chief
Justice, the Windward opinion talks about foreign shipowner
and I assume when the Court uses foreign shipowner, it means
just that.
Now, this is a different issue.
question.

It is a different

It is not before this Court and it may very well

pose a different issue when, in effect, you have got a
foreign flag vessel, constructively, by law, American-owned.,
as many of these major petroleum and multinational corpor­
ations exist under Liberia, where there is no question,
admittedly, by their own specimen, that these vessels are
American-owned, directed by Americans under a pledge to be
kept that way, constructively American subject to their call.
And I think the concerns for relationships with
respect to what I refer to euphemistically as a true foreign
shipowner and another, I think are different.

But in all

candor, I do not — this case in that particular fact
pattern is not before this Court.
Now, in addition to Maritime and in addition to
questions of whether or not the volume of the business keeps
the particular employer within the coverage of the Act,

9
there are other instances as well.
Example, a railroad, this Court's decision in
New York-Nevr Haven, local 25; there, the underlined dispute
involved there was not within the competence of the Act
and yet this Court held at another demonstration that under
those circumstances, what the complaint there •— what the
party complaining of there was, the secondary conduct withii
the competence of the Labor Board and that this was part of
Congress' scheme and

I think a last illustration — and I

am sure there are many more

the last ohe I could

possibly come across — is the agricultural industry.
The agricultural industry is not within the
Board’s competence and nevertheless, there are cases — and
we cite the Ninth Circuit in forcing the San: Francisco
Labor Council, notwithstanding the dispute with the farm
laborers, the Chaves group

nevertheless, "American unions

subject to the Act, American employers, the Labor Board has
jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction.
Garmon,

At least, under

it is arguably prohibited.
Now, this is what I see, what we see, what this

case is all about.
The Solicitor General, the Government, proposes
that it doesn't — the analogy we gave or the authorities
we have doesn't apply, and cites Hanna

Mining.

And I think I'd like to direct a few moments'

10
attention to this Court’s holding in Hanna

Mining.

Hanna

Mining case was an attempt by an American officers' union
to engage in picketing in the waters of the State of
Wisconsin to compel the supervisors and compel the employer
as well to make the supervisors join the union and the
case came before this Court with the Wisconsin court finding
that that conduct was arguably within the ken or the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Board.
I think Mr. Justice Harlan made quite clear, in
that case, that the conduct which was sought to be remedied
finding no such preemption was conduct which would go
unregulated, which Congress in its scheme said the Labor
Board should not regulate and that to come down with a
result and to find that the state court was preempted by the
Labor Board would leave that conduct totally uncontrolled
and in that instance, on the -— I think that Mr. Justice
Brennan held in his concurring opinion, the union there,
which is complaining

incidentally there x^as secondary

conduct, but the core •— and this is language that
Mr. Justice Harlan used, "The vital core of the dispute" was
the attempt by the Engineers’ Union to organize these
people to economic force and that was in the desires of
their members, which was not controtable at all, even under
the federal law, particularly in view of Section 3(B)(7)
and the fact that the supervisors, I should say, are

11
without the structure of it.
Now, that is worlds apart, totally different
analogy of contest in any sense of arguing with this case.
We have a foreign shipovmer, if he has cause to
believe, has a remedy in the state court that can take hold
of any conduct which interferes with an attempt to breach
the agreements between the foreign seamen and the foreign
shipowner, the articles, the contracts.
In Hanna Mining, the result, as determined by
the Wisconsin court, did not permit of that and when I am
directed to, in substance, what we are talking about is the
Congressional scheme.

I think we all come back to that

again as to what Congress had in mind and what its
motivations and purposes were.
Congress had in mind that American employers and
American unions -- American workingmen most significantly,
had certain rights.
adjustments.

There were accommodations.

There were

And that 8(B)(4) encompasses all that

legislative history and debate so that not only is certain
conduct intended to be prohibited, involving neutrals, but
there is also certain rights, protected activity, which
Congress determined should be exercised by American workers.
I find, frankly, maybe subjectively, quite
alarming the Solicitor General's proposal for what he calls
"concurrent jurisdiction."

12
What he is saying,, he is asking this Court to do,
notwithstanding all its legislative history, is the
following:
He says, insofar as it affects the secondary
conduct, as in this case — and look at page 29 of the
Appendix and at the Alabama Supreme Court's injunction,
and they don't say a word about the foreign vessel.

They

just regulate my client’s conduct and this employer and all
vessels, American and otherwise, as if this was a typical,
garden-variety Labor Board injunction and the Solicitor
General says, by concurrent jurisdiction, that regulation
about secondary conduct should be, in effect, bifold.
Not under federal law, though.

Not like under

Section 301 of the Act for breach of contract or Section 303
for damages for violation of secondary boycott, where state
courts have jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction but must
apply federal law.

Oh, no.

The Solicitor General asks for

a situation where my friends on the other side get two bites
at the apple, not one, and maybe other people will get the
equivalent two bites.
He says there is concurrent jurisdiction between
the Labor Board or. the one hand, to take a look into it to
see whether conduct is prohibited or whether it is not
violative, and on the other hand, it is a right of the
party to go to state courts.

13
I frankly find this totally at odds with the many
decisions of this Court relative to the intent of the Act —
and we are talking about secondary boycott conduct and the
need for uniformity in Section 10 (a)'s command for
exclusivity.
Now, another interesting fact that is coming out
of that, you could arrive at a situation where people such
as the Respondent's here could go into a state court and
get relief under state law — whether it is in the old
Lemly Guy, inducing breach of contracts or other concepts,
for which the top court of Alabama may affirm — and of
which there is no federal question to come before this
Court.
Yet another party goes before the Labor Board
and the Labor Board's case comes before this -Court and you
get a diametrically-opposed situation and that is only some
of the horrors,-

.

>

There are more significant horrors/

*'

We have, I

believe, 30-some-odd coastal states where are water In this
country.

Are we to have 30 -some-odd Interpretations

depending upon the states as to the impact of secondary
boycotts?
That would be totally violative of the Congress­
ional intent.
I think you have got similar problems with the

IU
Solicitor General's conduct.
Morris-LaGuardia is an integral part of our labor
policy which says federal courts generally are prohibited
from issuing an Injunction and yet part of that fabric in
Congressional legislative scheme is that Norris-LaGuardia
is to reserve solely to the federal system certain conduct
which carries with it that state courts are not to act on it
and the same state courts — absent little Norris-LaGuardia
acts — have no such proscription.
We wind up, again, under this opted-for policy,
coming out at the extreme once again and, finally, in
connection with what appears to me to be some of these horror
stories, is the question of Section 10(A) and its express
Congressional intent of ceding aboard jurisdiction.
But it has got to be consistent with the Act.
There has got to be an agreement consistent with it and the
law must be equally applied.
Again, under the Solicitor General's contention,
it would totally violate each and every one of those terms
and provisions.
I think there is, of course, an even more
significant point,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the Windward

opinion, cited this Court’s Lauritaen case and the footnote
there of brash appeals, candid brash appeals of the seamen
in those instances who wanted this Court to legislate, in

15
effect.
I say this is equally, if not more, a brash
attempt for the Solicitor General to do that.

But there is

something more significant which was not present, either in
Lauritsen or in Windward.
Since this case, there has been proposed in both
Houses, legislation which seeks to preserve domestic
employment opportunities for American seamen and that is
what we are engaged here.
It is known as the Energy Transportation Security
Act of 1974.

Extensive hearings were held.

The Solicitor's

client, the State Department, came before both Houses and
they each and every one of these are he is making subjec­
tively in his brief, national concerns, concerns for the
economy, international relations, exasce’rbation.
He apparently was not successful.

For whatever

reason, whether they disagreed or found no basis or made
the adjustment. Congress has moved and Congress has passed
that bill in the following manner:
The bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House,
rejecting the State Department's proposals, overwhelmingly
in the Senate.

The conferees of both Houses have met.

The

report of the conferees has been acted upon by the House
and accepted overwhelmingly.
The Senate's report will be acted upon, was just

16
recently, over the recess.
But, equally significant, is that the Solicitor
General recognised that the proper forum where to go with
this sort of argument is not to drag it through this Court QUESTION:

What Act was that?

MR. SCHULMAN:

The Energy

Transportation Security

Act?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SCHULMAN:

We have it in our brief.

Vie cited

it in our brief.
QUESTION:

Well, succinctly, what does it say?

MR. SCHULMAN:

What the law says is that imported

American oil — petroleum products in this country — it has
got to be carried 30 percent — up to 30 percent in
American flag ships.
As legislative history demonstrates, one of the
purposes, as expressed by Senator Long in a long colloquy
with the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, was to make sure
there were domestic employment opportunities for American
seamen.
QUESTION:

Is this, what, exports or imports?

MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

Imports to our country -~

MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

Imports of petroleum products.

Thatfs right.

Imports to our country of petroleum

17
products.
MR. SCHIJLMAN:

Carriage of petroleum products

into our country.
QUESTION:

Thirty percent has to be in American

bottoms?
MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, up to 30 percent.

Well, what do you mean, "Up to 30

percent"?
MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

It could be aero.

MR. SCHULMAN:
scale.

It’s graduated.

No, by 1977 — it is a graduated

By 1977 it has got to be a full 30 percent.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. SCHULMAN:

Certain rights are reserved in the

event of an emergency, obviously, to suspend upon action of
the Executive and the Legislative Branch.
QUESTION:

None of that has any bearing on the

issue we have here.
MR. SCHULMAN:

It doesn’t have any bearing on it?

No, other than it demonstrates, to me, that each and every
one of the arguments that the Solicitor has used here in
his brief submitted to this Court, he has used before
Congress and we so demonstrated in our supplemental brief.
We cite t^rhere he has used it.
And in each and every instance, the Congress has

18
just rejected it.
QUESTION:

Congress is making a policy decision,

is it not?
MR. SCHULMAN:

Yes, and that Is what I believe,

however.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is what we are

making here?
MR. SCHULMAN:

No.

I think the Solicitor is

asking you for — of course, when you read his brief, he
talks about the concerns.
so

He is saying, "This should be

because of the concern for foreign relations.

This

should be so because of the concern for national affairs.
This should be so because of the concern for the economy."
Each and every Instance, to me.-, that it presents
an Issue, is purely legislative and equally significant,
made by the Secretary — the Secretary, of State as xvell as
other agencies of the United States Government, the
Executive Branch, the Congress cannot accept it and that, to
me, is a brash appeal.
Now, maybe my subjective thinking is a little
colored, but it would appear to me that if you go to one
foreign body and you reject It there. It doesn’t sit well
to look for another suitor, to go to another

foreign, to

go shopping and I submit, and so submits the state, I believe
this is what the Solicitor is doing here, doing just that.

19
I see I have just a few moments, and I'd just like
to direct a few remarks First Amendment argument and the
Free Speech argument.
The Alabama Supreme Court, talking about the
conduct Involved here, the conduct involved was the same
conduct in the national policy actions of these unions all
over the country, mute pickets, handing out signs, acting
for help and assistance to protect their jobs.
Alabama Supreme Court says, in approaching that
issue, that, first of all, it has the right notwithstanding,
I add. First and Fourteenth Amendment, to cease and issue
a notice restricting all

picketing pending its looking

into the purpose and object where the effects may affect the
national economy of the state.
Now, as I read this, the prohibited conduct which
this Court expressed from Thornhill up to Keefe °f a blanket
provision, saying, when that affects the economy of our
local area, that our state policy is that all picketing is
to be restrained.
We know of no such authority to that effect.
We do not think that a state possesses that right
on. the mere expression that it may affect the local
economy to stop all free speech.
is not Vogt.

That is not Giboney.

That

That is not Hanke and the other cases

authorizing in labor disputes a state valid policy in the

20

domain open to them for specific conduct, to restrict the
specific conduct, such as antlmonopolistic practices.
But I think there is more in this case which we
find and argued in our brief.
In addition to that, Alabama says, wrongful
interference and nothing more, just the two words,
"wrongful interference," with a person's right to do
business as a matter of state policy may enjoin picketing.
I submit —• or pamphleting.

I submit that runs

directly afoul of this Court's decision in Keefe, where
the man was engaged in business at his house-,
a problem.

That poses

I believe Alabama may not so broadly restrict.
They have not established the confines, the valid

state public policy assuming the demand is open to him,
assuming there is no preemption.
And, finally, we have involved here, I think, in
the final analysis, is Alabama making a finding by its
Supreme Court when the

district court and the local court

made no findings effect and the Alabama Supreme Court, in
answering our objection to that said, well, they must have
made certain findings, otherwise they wouldn’t have
issued the injunction.
I guess, under those circumstances, we don't need
appellate courts.
Nothwithstending that , the issue which x^re are

21
presenting here, and we have enumerated quite a bit in our
brief, is that they hit upon a personal hope and desire of
a very low official who testified under very skilfull crossexamination, my good friend. Prank McRight, here, as to
his personal hopes and desires, what he would personally
like to see and admittedly, he had nothing to do with the
campaign other than to set up the picket lines and capry the
instructions out and based upon that, the Court said, the
purpose of this picketing may have been to tie up the whole
harbor until Congress brought some legislation to bring
the whole harbor down.
And I say, under this Court's decision in Graham,
the need to search the record to find subsisting facts,
essential facts to warrant restrictions of the First and
Fourteenth Amendment, should be made in this case and I
think when they are made in this case, there is no finding
that the conduct of this individual, his own personal hopes
and expectations, could be charged, against the conduct of
this committee and the thousands of American seamen who are
merely exercising a fundamental right.
I reserve the few moments left, if I may,
Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. McRight.

Very well, Mr. Sehulman.

22
ORAL ARGUMENT OP PRANK McRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT1,
MOBILE STEAMSHIP ASSOCIATION, INC.
MR MC RIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I had, quite frankly, thought with this Court's
issuance of the decision in Windward that Petitioner's
preemption argument wouldn't be urged.
The picketing in Windward was the same as the
picketing in Mobile.

It was in furtherance of the same

national program involving the same unions, the same
picket signs, having the same effect, using the same
leaflets.
The same consequences in Windward, as this Court
noted in Windward, were noted by the Alabama Supreme Court
as to picketing in Mobile.
It was either to force a raise in the internal
standards in those vessels or to block those vessels from
the use of the U. S. ports and, of course,.this Court held
that in Windward, under those circumstances, the picketing
was not subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor
Relations Board.
Essentially, the Petitioners argued two
distinctions between this case and the Houston picketing in
Windward.

23
One, they have apparently abandoned here In oral
argument.

That Is, the allegation that the vessels

involved were collectively American-owned.

So we won't need

to talk about that one.
The other distinction is that, although the pri­
mary dispute here may not be in commerce, there were
secondary effects which are in commerce and which are
subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations
Board.
Of

course, in Windward,

the picketing not being in commerce.

we were talking about
It is the same

picketing here that was Involved so this Court's deter­
mination that the picketing was not in commerce certainly
should carry some weight beyond the allegation that the
primary dispute was not in commerce and it was the pic­
keting here that was the subject of our complaint.
The allegations of the state court complaint were
against the picketing.

Specifically, paragraphs 20, 21,

22 of the complaint "complained of picketing and other
interference directed at the foreign flag vessels in the
Port of Mobile."
So it was the picketing itself that was the basis
of the Mobile Steamship Association's complaint.

The fact

that there rnay be secondary aspects involved here has
pretty well been disposed of.

I think this Court, in

24
Hanna versus MEBA indicated that where the primary dispute,
In that case a dispute involving efforts to organize
supervisors, employees not covered by the National Labor
Relations Act, indeed, foreipjn crewmen not covered by the
National Labor Relations Act here, where the primary dispute
was not in commerce.
As this Court held in Windward, the fact that a
state court injunction might, in fact, regulate some conduct
arguably subject — arguably violative of Section 8(B)(4),
did not prevent the State Supreme Court from — the state
courts from acting.
The Court indicated — Mr. Justice Brennan in the
concurring opinion, that the issue was whether Congress had
excluded state regulation of picketing outside the coverage
of the Act when the picketing also has secondary aspects
arguably within the reach of Section

8(B)(4) and the Court

said no, that in that area federal occupation of the matter
is at a minimum and state power is at a peak.
QUESTION:

Well, that is a -- then you are just

saying the preemption doctrine shouldn’t apply rather than
arguing that the impact on the stevedores, for example, was
nor arguably within the jurisdiction of the Board.
MR. MC RIGHT:

Yes, sir.

I am saying that the

complaint that the stevedores made was against the picketing.
QUESTION:

You would concede and still make your

25
same argument —you would concede that, at least arguably,
the stevedores would have a remedy under 8(B)(l})> before
the Board.
MR. MC RIGHT:

Your Honor, I think we might

allege it, but I am very much afraid that under the —
QUESTION:

I know, but arguably, you. could --

because you are a neutral employer.

You see what I mean?

You are feeling the pinch.
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And maybe the primary employer Is not

subject to the Act, but, nevertheless, you'are the —
MR. MC RIGHT:

I don't think under.those circum­

stances that the Board, under Windward, could get its hands
on the real problem.
And the real problem here being the picketing, the
coersive picketing directed at the parties like us.
QUESTION:

Oh, the neutral party fs In commerce.

I mean, it is —- well
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

But I think the situation —

But, anyway, your argument primarily is,

even if that is true, the preemption doctrine should not
apply.
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

So you are — the Solicitor General

seems to — seems compelled to say that this is arguably

26
within the jurisdiction of the Board, but, nevertheless,
there should be concurrent jurisdiction of the state court.
Is that your argument?
HR. MC RIGHT:

That is what he is saying.

I am

saying that the real problem here with the picketing was,
and we’ll get into that in a few minutes on the constitu­
tional question, the real problem i\rith the picketing here
was that it interfered with the operation of the Alabama
State Docks.

It shut it down and it virtually closed the

Port of Mobile and could close the ports of this country to
foreign shipping.
I don’t think the National Labor Relations Board
has jurisdiction to entertain that kind of objection.
QUESTION:

So you don’t agree with the Solicitor

General.
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

Not entirely, no, sir.

You say there is not preemption at all,

not even to the extent of allowing the Board to have
concurrent jurisdiction.
MR. MC RIGHT:

Not as to the complaint we made in

the state court, no, sir.
QUESTION:

But if it were applicable, the Board

could enjoin the picketing to protect the neutral employer,
which is getting pretty close to the site on the problem.
MR. MC. RIGHT:

If we could prove secondary

2?
motive, perhaps — but they couldn’t get to the problem that
we complained of.
QUESTION:

Well, anyway, you’d rather not have to

try to prove an 8(B)(4) ca.se before the Board.
MR. MC RIGHT:

That is essentially the case.

QUESTION:

That Is the xtfay with preemption

QUESTION:

You are happy with the state court

employers.

having exclusive jurisdiction.
MR. MC RIGHT:

Yes, sir.

Now, as to the constitutional issue —■ and 1 want
to hurry, because we have agreed to divide argument.

We

have got another Respondent, the farmer that was injured
by the picketing, too.
But as to the constitutional issue, I think the
evidence is pretty clear that the picketing was not really
publicity, but really intended, designed and conducted to
signal other organized worker's not to go to work.

The

picketing commenced within a very few minutes after the
ILA, in fact, was ordered to return to work by the federal
courts.
It was timed and located to be in the path of the

ILA.

The ILA is an affiliated union with the six maritime

unions that are Petitioners here.
Indeed, the Masters, Mates and Pilots, one of

28
the petitioning unions, is a part of the ILA, the division
of the ILA.

They knew, they said they had more than a

reasonable expection that the ILA would not cross the picket
lines.
When the union’s witness was asked why he didn’t
time and locate the picketing and so was not to interfere
with the work calls of the ILA, the comment was made by
counsel that that kind of question shows incredible
ignorance of what a picket line is supposed to be, xvhat
that particular picket line was supposed to be and it was
admitted in the brief that Petitioner’s picket line meant,
essentially, do not work.

Do not work on these vessels,

brother union members and the objective was to — in effect,
was to shut the state docks down to foreign shipping.
It came at a very critical time because, at that
particular time, the Soledad farmers -—
QUESTION:

What case here do you think is the

closest to warranting an injunction against this kind of
so-called"Informational picketing?"
MR. MG RIGHT:

Well, I think Hanke, sir.

I think

this Court, in a number of cases, has indicated that
picketing by organised labor in the path of other organized
labor is more than free speech.
In the Hughes case, the Court said picketing by
the organized group is more than free speech.

The presence

29
of such a picket line may induce action.
In Glboney, it is clear

that the unions were

doing more than exercising their right to free speech and I
would likes because there was reference in a reply brief
to the Logan Valley case — indeed5 the briefs in Logan
Valley where the Petitioner has indicated that there was
signal picketing involved there, to state for the Court
that in Logan Valley we only had one issue — the Court
only was faced with one issue and that was a pure property
question.
There was an appeal to union members, but union
/

members as consumers and not union members as employees and
I think that is a significant difference.

T'think union

members as employees or any members of any organized group
tend to act by virtue of traditions, tend to act by virtue
of taboos and solidarity that aren’t involved in a situation
vrhere the appeal is purely to consumers asking for, by
virtue of the persuasive nature of the message, individual
action.
QUESTION:

Is there a state court finding here

as to the purpose of the picketing?
MR. MC RIGHT:

In the state trial court, no, sir.

There was a discussion of the purpose of the picketing and
its conduct in the Alabama Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

But that finding is critical to your

30
argument, isn’t it?

I mean3 some sort of a finding as to

what the purpose was, that it really wasn’t just infor­
mational picketing?
MR. MC RIGHT:

Yes, sir, and I think that finding

is contained in the Alabama —
QUESTION:

Where is that?

MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

— Supreme Court.

Without it —- without It you would be

urging us to make our own — to do our own reading of the
record.
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

Well, I think

In the first Instance.

MR, MC RIGHT:

Yes, sir.

I think there Is enough

of the facts shown that the picketing was located in the
path of ILA laborers, that Mr. Neary wanted to shut down -QUESTION:

Well, how close did the Alabama c-ourt

come to holding what you say the facts show?:
MR. MC RIGHT:

Well, on page 14a of the Appendix,

’’The dispute was either one between the unions and the
foreign shipowners to force a rise in the internal standards
of those vessels, or one where the Intent was to block the
use of those ships to force Congressional action."
On page 21, the Appellants contend that the only
purpose was to carry out publicity picketing to inform the
public of the plight of the .American seaman.

The

31
Appellee contends the picketing was done for the purpose
of inducing and encouraging the Appellee's employees to
cease loading.
QUESTION:

What did the Court say as between those

two statements?
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

What did the Supreme Court say as to

those two statements?

Did they pick one of them as true

a.nd one of them as false?
MR. MC RIGHT:

I’m sorry to use the time.

On page 25 at the bottom of the page —
QUESTION:

45?

MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

25, your Honor.

Well, Mr. MeRights the court that

issued the injunction didn’t make any findings of any kind?
MR. MC RIGHT:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

How can you do that?

MR. MC RIGHT:

Well, I’ll say this, your Honor,

in Alabama, the practice and custom has not been for the
state court to, as a matter of custom in a findings of fact,
conclusions of law.

Granted that in a federal system this

is required under Rule 54 — or 51, I’m not sure which.
QUESTION:
now?

Well, what are ure left to do on this

Go into the record and make our own findings?
MR. MC RIGHT:

Your Honor, I think there is ample

32
findings in the Alabama Supreme Court opinion to sustain
the position that we
QUESTION:

—

Well, then, you have got some more

argument than what you have already read, I assume?
MR. MC RIGHT:

On page 25 — and I think there

that they take — that the court takes the position that
under either alternative, if a purpose was to block the use
of the Port of Mobile to foreign vessels or to force foreign
shipowners to increase their wages, either of those would
be violative of Alabama public policy.
QUESTION:

I don’t really >—

Do you think that the Supreme Court of

Alabama follows the custom of many other state courts in
reviewing both on fact and law and equity appeal whereas
they wouldn’t damage actions?
MR. MC RIGHT:
because the case

Yes, sir, they

certainly would

was tried to a judge and in that event,

evidence is presented to the Court and the.appeals instance
can be read just as well as heard by the trial court.
QUESTION:

And we should read it, too.

MR. MC RIGHT:

I don’t think it is that much

there, your Honor and I do think that it is largely
uncontroverted, certainly as to the signal effect of the
picketing and certainly as to its ultimate purpose.

I donst

think there is any real controversy of fact over those two
points and I think that, with that in mind, that this Court,

33
applying Hanke, where you have a situation that union
members were appealing to union deliverymen not to make
deliveries in order to force recognition of the unions by
self-employed persons, that this Court indicated that a
balance has to be struck and that balance comes to this
Court bearing a weighty title of respect.
I would like to say that the Petitioner’s re­
ference to the Amicus brief filed by the — excuse me, to
the briefs filed in the Logan Valley case are very helpful
and, in particular, I would ask the Court, if it would, to
take a look at the Amicus brief .filed by the APL-CIO in
that case, who appeared as Amicus here.
I think they recognized the point that we are
making; that is, that signa], picketing, because it is by
nature so very coersive, can be limited, even though the
act sought is lawful in and of itself, uncoersive
solicitation of that particular Act would be constitutionally
protected free speech.
That statement and other statements begin on
page 16 of the brief and are very enlightening on the
different kinds of picketing and how my friends on the
other side of the table view the picketing generally in
terms of constitutional context.

I think the real question here — certainly
their Alabama policy, the Alabama State Docks is a public

34
facility.

Certainly the picketing interfered with the

operation of that public facility.

There are decisions of

this Court that indicate that intentional interference with
the operation of public facilities may be constitutionally
limited, interference with court systems, the jail system
were the subject of the cases of Cox and the Adderly
decisions.
Beyond that, these unions, by their announced
purpose, could and would close the ports of this country,
including the Port of Mobile, the only seaport in Alabama,
to foreign shipping.
Foreign shipping comprises, by tonnage, I think
something like 95 percent of the commerce — foreign
commerce of the country, something like 70, 80 percent of
the vessels that call at the Port of Mobile fly a foreign
flag.
I think any society acting in its self-interest
can establish a policy.

Indeed, Congress could establish a

policy if it so wished.
Alabama, through its judiciary, has recognized
that policy that the interference on such a large scale
with the essential economy of a society can be regulated
and the question presented is whether or not the Petitioners
have a constitutionally-protected right to use signal
picketing to close the Port of Mobile, indeed, the ports of

35
this country, to foreign flag shipping.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Lankford.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEX F. LANKFORD, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
ROBERT E. MALONE
MR. LANKFORD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In response to Mr. Justice Marshall’s inquiry as
to what the record shows as to the purpose and Intent, and
Mr. McRight commented that there was really no dispute on
it, on page 126a, the question was put to the Petitioners*
only itfitness, "My hope is to clutter up the Port of Mobile
with foreign ships, Liberian, Panamanian ships to bring
sufficient pressure on the United States Government to do
something about the American Merchant Marine.
"That is your intention?
"Yes, sir.
"That is your purpose?
"Yes, sir."
This is in the record.
unequivocal.

To me or to anyone it is

The witness was the sole witness presented by

Petitioners as a live witness in the court in Mobile.

This

is the fifth court that farmer Malone has been in. on this

36
issue and each court we go. the higher we go, the lower
Mr. Neira goes.
He is the — has been the port agent for the
Petitioner SIU and the Port of Mobile for 15 years.

It is

he who called all of the coordinating unions together and
told them what they were going to do.
It is Mr. Neira who put the pickets out on the
line and told them what to do but when we get to the highest
ccurt in the land., he is reduced to a man of menial
mutterings, vagrant mutterings , just barely able to find
his way in and out of the union hall.
This testimony is so damaging that the man has
been belittled and belittled, and belittled the higher we
go in court.
The time and the place of these pickets is
extraordinarily interesting.

It came at the heighth of the

grain season where the grain must be harvested.
be left out there.
to store the grain.

It cannot

These farmers don't have enough storage
The only place in South Alabama., North­

west Florida and Mississippi for export grain is the public
grain elevator at the state docks in the State of Alabama in
Mobile.

When that gets stopped up, the grain stays in the

field and it rots.
The pickets were put up within minutes of the time
that a federal judge in Mobile ordered a sister union, the

37
ILA, back to work.
The pickets were put in an isolated place at the
state docks.

Information to the public, the only public

that was there, were the ILA members, the Petitioners' sister
union members, who wouldn't cross their picket lines to
load and unload the vessels.
The other element of the public that was there
were the foreign seamen, whom they wanted to see the signs
and whom Mr. Neira again

testified that that is what we

wanted to do, we wanted to see them.

We wanted them to

start a dispute with their foreign owners so that those
owners would pay them the equivalent of American wages.
This was testimony right into the.Windward case
where It was held or noted, at the very least, that the
Petitioners in that case — the Petitioners in this case —
would hope to accomplish would be to make the foreign ship­
owners raise their wage and pay them equivalent wages.
The results were dramatic.

The whole port was

shut down and at a time when the only vessels in port were
foreign flag, every one of them picketed, every one of them,
every single one of them.
stopped the grain elevator.

That stopped the court.

It

It puts the farmers’ grain out

In the fields to rot.
On the free speech, the free speech with pickets,
is free speech plus and can be regulated by the state within

38
reasonable bounds.
Logan Valley tells us that we must not unduly
Interfere with the normal use of public property.

Here the

Respondents were denied the use of state docks property
entirely, public property.
The decisions are federal decision's, require the
Court to balance this freedom of communication, freedom of
speech against the state’s power to reasonably curtail that
freedom of speech and this is what the trial court in ITobile
did, was to balance these competing interests.
There were four competent lawyers representing
Petitioners in that trial.

When the decision was announced,

not one of them said to the judge, "How about telling us
what you find the client did wrong?"
They were sitting in the courtroom.

They all knew.

And if they wanted findings, they could have at least
requested them from the judge and I submit —:
QUESTION:

Does your Alabama rules of procedure

in equity cases provide that either party may request
findings?
MR. LANKFORD:
are not always given.

Yes, they may request them but they
If I had thought, as a trial lawyer,

that the court had no basis for finding anything against me,
I would have requested findings, and to prepare the case for
appeal.

I am simply saying that when the court announced its

39
decision — and it is in here in the record — and asked for
comments from counsel, there was no complaint that you have
not defined exactly what you said our clients did wrong.
QUESTION:

Does the circuit judge, I gather from

your ansxver, have the discretion to refuse findings —
MR. LANKFORD:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— even though they are requested?

MR. LANKFORD:

Yes.

That is true.

Recently, the

federal — essentially, the federal rules for civil pro­
cedure have been adopted in the state, but they were not so
enforced at the time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lankford, was the permanent

injunction ever obtained in this case?
HR. LANKFORD:
injunction.

No, sir, this was a preliminary

That was the nature of it and the case is still

to be tried on the merits.

But as the Alabama Supreme

Court pointed out, the court has wide discretion as to
whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction and must
weigh these facts and I submit the court did weigh — the
trial court in Alabama did weigh.
QUESTION:

So that preliminary injunction remains

in effect to this day?
MR. LANKFORD:
QUESTION:

Correct.

As between your side and the ocher side,

which has the burden of converting It into a permanent one?

40
MR. LANKFORD:

It is his move.

If he wants to go

back and fight the lawsuit, we are ready.

However, he has

got farmer Malone in the federal court suing him for a
million dollars in punitive damage for alleged violation of
the Civil Rights Act of 1871 so this is a case pending in the
United States District Court In Mobile where Mr. Schulman
filed it, saying that these Petitioners against farmer
Malone saying that he went into state court under color of
lav; and maliciously and wantonly got rne enjoined.

We want

$15,000 normal damages from farmer Malone and we want a
million dollars punitive damages from farmer Malone and I
want farmer Malone to pay my attorneys'

fees.

We are talking about how many bites you get out
of the apple.

That case has been stayed pending the decision

of this case before this Court.
And I have a copy of the complaint if any of the
Court would like to see it or perhaps I even ought to suggest

that.
If free speech — if what they have done under the
guise of free speech is permitted, then It is going to be
the select committee of the Petitioners who set the wages,
the working conditions and everything about foreign seamen
aboard foreign flag vessels calling in the United States of
America.
If this free speech claim Is approved by this

'41

Court., that is what is going to happen
Also, what is going to happen is that this select
council of the Petitioners are going to tell the American
businessman what he can export, to whom he can export, and
the price he can charge because if they run all the foreign
flag vessels out of here, he is goinp; to be in a piclcle and
this is what they are trying to do and they will, if free
speech approved in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lankford, suppose that, instead of

picketing, they had placed ads in the newspaper and sent out
letters and thinp;s?

Would there be a violation of state

law by way of unlawful interference with business?
MR. LANKFORD:

No, sir, I do not think so.

think it would be purely informational picketing .

I
It was

not set in the path of a sister union’s aisleway, men going
to and from work.

It didn’t take the port and tie up and

clutter up the whole port with foreign

vessels.

It was

far different, your Honor, from simply notifying the public.
If this free speech was approved, then this
select committee of the Petitioners are going to be writing
this country's treaties with every maritime nation in the
world because they are going to be changing what happens to
a foreign flag vessel when it calls in our port, if they
have the right to run them off of our ports and they will,
if this Court gives them the right.

^3
p,’oods from our shores to foreign shores and on behalf of
Parmer Malone, I appeal to this Court not to permit this
kind of activity to choke the American farmer, because this
is what is going to happen to him if the stamp of approval
of this conduct that happened in Mobile is given by this
Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Lankford,

Did you have anything further, Mr. Schulman?
MR. SCHULMAN:

Yes, sir, a few moments more.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SCHULMAN, ESQ.
MR. SCHULMAN:

I would have thought, :if . r

listening to my friends,, I won the Windward' - case, not lost
it.
All this calamitous talk about tying up ports.
Well, that is what this Court decided in Windward the
foreign shipowner can go into court and enjoin the
picketing and I don’t understand why all these foreign
vessels are not going to call at our ports.
There isn’t any basis at all to their argument
and I think any question about the motivations of the people
I represent or the farmer involved as to what he is
concerned there, that should be better directed to Congress.
%

I'd like to direct a remark that both Mr. Justice
Marshall and Mr. Justice White, I believe, asked my friends

4 it
relative to the findings being made by the state court.
am reading now from page 28 of the Appendix.

I

"The trial

judge decree granting writ of temporary Injunction made no
finding of fact from the evidence and that is complete and
absolute.
"But, apparently, the trial judge found from the
evidence that there was wrongful interference by the
Appellants with the Appellees’business, for otherwise he
would not have ordered the writ of temporary injunction to
issue, "
The answer to that is, it was no finding.

The

Alabama Supreme Court just makes that indication on an
assumption.
QUESTION:

Did you say page 28?

HR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

Of the —?

MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

Of the Appendix.

That is what I have, but -™

MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

20a.

QUESTION:

20?

MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

28.

I*s sorry.

20a.

Oh, but then, over at page 23a, the

Supreme Court says, "This necessitates our deciding whether
or not there was any evidence

to support a conclusion that

45
’’the picketing had as a purpose or object the wrongful
interference with the appellee’s business."
And then, doesn’t the Supreme Court go on to
examine the record?
MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, and for which it says —

And conclude that there was no abusive-

discretion based on that evidence?
MR. SCHULMAN:

Yes, and that it may have been —

that the court below may have based upon that.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather ~~ it would appear, at

least, Mr. Schulman, that maybe we don’t do'this in the
federal courts, but in some state courts that I am familiar
with, one would have said the same thing, equity cases.
We didn't need findings of chancery court.

We

examined the record and made our own determination based on
the record —- in equity cases,
MR. SCHULMAN:
QUESTION:

In equity, yes.

And that is what this Is, I guess.

MR. SCHULMAN:

Yes.

But whether that meets the

standards necessary of the First and Fourteenth Amendment
I think is a different question.
QUESTION:

That may be.

MR. SCHULMAN:

With respect to the situation

involving Hanna and Windward, in both those instances, the
state court regulated otherwise unregulated conduct.

46
That is not the case here.

The otherwise conduct

involved here is a secondary aspect, regulated by the Labor
Board.
IJow, with respect to this talk about the record
as to the position of witnesses, I don’t intend to waste
this Court’s time in discussing that, other than as set
forth in the record and the position of this Mr, Neira and
whether there was adequate evidence upon which a court could
move in and say all these rights of these tens of thousands
of American seamen are suddenly abrogated and I think it is
a requirement to search that record and determine that, under
the Grant case, whether or not there was, in fact, the
necessary quantum to warrant such restriction, as the
Alabama court did here.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Before you sit down, Mr. Schulman.

Am

I -- on your preemption point, do I gather you distinguish
Windward because the Plaintiffs here are not the foreign,
shipowners?
MR. SCHULMAN:
because of titles, no.

No, that is not the —■ it isn’t
It is because of the substantive

nature of the complaint.
In the Windward case, the unions were accused of
interfering and trying to change the contractual.
As this Court said, they must have hoped or

is 7
expected they would have given more money.

Therefore, it

falls under Benz. which holds it involves internal operation
of the vessel.
QUESTION:

And what is the difference here?

MR. SCHULMAN:

The difference heii’e is that there

is — this is not the issue of this Plaintiff here is not
to regulate the conduct of foreign shipowners.

He is

saying, our picketing is stopping him from doing business,
which it is.
QUESTION:

And, therefore, you say that is an

MR. SCHULMAN:

And that is an 8(b)(4).
