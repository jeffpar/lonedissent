MR.-CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Smith, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ROBS SMITH„ ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice,, may it please the

Court, this case is here on certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the- Eighth Circuit and involves a
disciplinary sanction imposed against three tenth grade
female public school students for violating $. school board
regulation prohibiting the possession or use of intoxicating
beverages at school or at a school-sponsored function.
The Petitioners are members of the Board of
Education of the Mena Special School District of Polk County,
Arkansas.
The Petitioners submit that the basic issue here
is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed directed
verdicts for the School Board defendants in a public s.choc
students' suit under 42 USO § 1923 on the grounds that the
School Board had misconstrued and misapplie

its c

. re go ■ a-

tion and that the application of that regulation to thee:;..
students deprived them of-Fourteenth Amendment substantive
due process.
The Petitioners' contention that there is nothi:--:";/
in this record fco warrant the exercise of Federal juris­
diction in that Respondents have shown -the deprivation of

4
no federally-protected right,

For reasons which I hope to

discuss later, we submit that the issue of procedural due
process is not properly before the Court in this case, and
would call the Court's attention to the fact that the
amicus brief submitted on behalf of the Responsents deals
only with the procedural due process issue and does not reach
the substantive due process question.
The basic facts are uncontroverted.

Early in the

school day on February 7, 1972, three female students, two
of whom are Respondents here, devised a plan to leave the
school premises to purchase an alcoholic beverage which they
intended to put in the refreshments to be served later that
day at a joint parent-student function to be held on school
premises.

This function was sponsored by the Home Economics

Department.
Since this school district is situated in a
county in Arkansas which has exercised its local option, and
has voted dry, the sale of alcoholic beverages in the county
is unlawful, the Respondents drove out of the county, across
the State line into the State of Oklahoma, where they pur­
chased at a tavern a quantity of malt liquor beverage.
Returning to Mena, they then purchased a non­
alcoholic beverage with which they mixed the malt liquor,
returned to school and completed their plan.
Several days later their teacher learned of this

5

incident and confronted the girls with her information.
After first denying that they had been engaged in this con­
duct , they later admitted their involvement.
The matter was then brought to the attention of the
principal.

He advised them that he would invoke e one-week

suspension until such time as the Board of Education had an
opportunity to deal with the question, and that it was their
ultimate responsibility.
That evening the Board did meet to consider the
matter,,

The principal and the teacher who had visited with

the girls earlier that week relayed to the Board the informa­
tion that was given them by the students, and the Board voted
to suspend the girls for the balance of the semester pursuant
to the regulation cited in our briefs.
Q

Eight there, Mr. Smith, what is the balance of the

semester?

This was in February, wasn't it?
MR. SMITH:

February 7.

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

This occurred on

The hearing was on February 18.

So that would be until June?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, normally the sc’iool year

in Arkansas school districts lasts through May, yes, sir.
Q

briefs

I think there are statements made in some of the
that the girls lost a full year.

How could they lose

the first half of the year then?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the Court of Appeals made

6

that observation in its opinion and, frankly, there is no
evidentiary support in the record to sustain that.

They

had completed the first semester of that school year, and
there is nothing to suggest that they lost any credit other
than that which they would have earned in the soring semester;
namely, two units.
0

Now that I have you interrupted, under Arkansas law,

how long does a student -— how long is a student under
compulsion to attend school?
Mft. SMITH:

Up until the age of fifteen, Your

Honor, and both of these students — one was sixteen and
one was seventeen, so they were beyond the reach of the
compulsory attendance law.
Q

Has the third girl—
MR. SMITH:

This is contrary to an observation of

the district judge, I might add.
Q

Excuse me,,

Has the third girl never been a party to this

litigation?
MR. SMITH:
G

That is correct, Your Honor..

And she, apparently, was the main force behind the

enterprise, was she not?
MR. SMITH;

According to the testimony of the other

two girls, perhaps that is an accurate characterisation,
Q

Up to what age in Arkansas does a person have a

right to attend a public school; or is there no limit?

7

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I don't know that there

is a right to attend the public schools up to a certain age.
The schools may furnish instruction for students between the
ages of six and twenty-one.
Q

May or are they required to?
MR. SMITH:

Q

They are required.

Well, if there is an obligation on one side, I

suppose there is a right on the other side, isn’t there?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, but I didn't mean to

imply that a school district has to furnish courses of
instruction for a person twenty years of age, for example.
Q

Well, if he has graduated from the twelfth grade,

I suppose—MR. SMITH:
Q

Right.

—that's the end of it.
MR. SMITH:

After the girls and the parents were

informed of the decision made at the special Board meeting,
they were later furnished, at their request and the request
o£ their counsel, a special Board meeting to be held on
March 2.
At the outset of this meeting, the Board present*:!:
a statement of facts which they had found and or, rJ ich che--?
'had based their suspension.

Included in. this statement

was the following, which appears at Appendix, page 137:
That the three girls in question travelled to

8
Oklahoma, purchased a number of bottles of rne.lt liquor, a
beer-type beverage and later went onto school premises with
tire alcoholic beverage and put two or more bottles of the
drink into the punch or liquid refreshment which was to be
served to members of the class and their parents.

The

Respondents and their counsel were then given an opportunity
to respond,.which they did.

After the conclusion of this

presentation, the Board again voted that the children would
be suspended for the balance of the year,
Q

What was the nature of the defent (sic)?
JiR. SMITHs

Q

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

What, if anything, was the nature of the defense?
MR. SMITH:

Q

Your Honor, the—

7. really don't mean to disturb you, I was just

curious.
MR. SMITH:

The district judge, in his opinion,

stated that there had never been any contention by the students
or their parents that the rules had not, in fact, been
violated.

Their contention was the punishment was excessive.
On the other

hand, their counsel did argue, it

doesn't appear that this argument was presented at the Board
hearing, but he certainly argued at the trial of the case that
because of the low alcoholic content of this particular
beverage, which evidence demonstrated later to be 3.2 percent,
that there was actually no—

9
Q

Is that 3.2?
•MR. SMITH:

Q

3.2 percent, yes, sir.

That—

In solution only a little bit of the 3„2—
MR, SMITH:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

That’s

correct.
The argument was that there had been no proof that
the beverage was, in fact, intoxicating, that no violation of
the rule had been shown, and that this constituted a viola­
tion of substantive Federal constitutional due process.

And

that is the basis upon which the Court of Appeals ultimately
based their opinion.
0

The Court of Appeals said that it based its

opinion on substantive due process, but I didn't read its
opinion as saying that the School Board couldn't, as a
matter of substantive regulation, provide that you could
expel a person for putting beer in a punch.

I read it more

as a kind of review of the evidence type of opinion,
MR, SMITH:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

It's a Shuffling Sam case.

Are you familiar

with that case?
Q

A no evidence case.

Q

A no evidence case.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

what the Court of Appeals held.

Yes, sir, that's essentially
In doing so, however, I

think the Court of Appeals conveniently overlooked the fact

10
that the School Board construed their regulation to reach
alcoholic beverages.
March 14.

They so found in a statement issued

The girls themselves admitted a violation.

And,

as a matter of fact, testimony at the trial demonstrated
that when the regulation was adopted, it was adopted in
response to an incident involving beer, which has — well,
I don't think the record shows what the beer would have had
in terms of alcoholic content.
Q

This was 3.2 I think you said, didn't you?
MR. SMITH:

Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

Is that intoxicating?

I thought we used to be

allowed to drink that because it wasn't.
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, in terms of the Arkansas

statute's definition of an intoxicating liquor, from a
criminal standpoint, it is in excess of 3.2.

They define

beer as a malt beverage containing up to 3.2 percent alcohol.
Q

My question was 3.2, whatever you call it.
MR. SMITH:

Q

Not to exceed.

Not to exceed 3.2?
MR. SMITH:

Not to exceed 3.2, yes, sir.

This particular beverage.
Q

Is that beverage intoxicating?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, in terms of the Arkansas

statute, it is not.
Q

Are you old enough to remember when we used to be

11
allowed to drink 3.2 beer?
MR. SMITH:

I don’t know how to answer that.

I

don’t think I have ever drank 3.2 beer, Your Honor.
Q

All right.

Q

Is it illegal in this county?
MR. SMITH:

I can tell you from personal experience

S: is.

And the prosecuting attorney,

when inquired, when the Board president inquired of him as
to the nature of this beverage, he said, in :his view, it
was an intoxicating beverage, its possession was unlawful,
he had prosecuted individuals for possessing it in that
county.
Q

When was it mixed, in the school or out of the

school?
MR. SMITH:
Q

I beg your pardon?

when was it mixed with all of these- other juices?
MR. SMITH:

It was mixed with the non-alcoholic

beverage off 'the school premises.
Q

So when it got on the school premises it was

not intoxicating?
MR. SMITH:

It is 84 ounces of solution, 24 ounces

of which was alcoholic, and then, of course, 3.2 percent; of
that was the alcohol.
Q

I understand.

Q

It was 3,2 diluted, which made it less than 3.3.
MR. SMITH:

That’s the point.

Yes, Your Honor,

12
Q

I thought you said 3.2 Made it intoxicating and

below 3.2 was not.
MR. SMITH:

That’s the definition provided in the

criminal statutes of the State of Arkansas.
adopted by the School Board January 10, 1967.

Tills rule was
The Board

president and two of the Board members who were on the Board
at that time testified that when they adopted this rule, it
was adopted in reference to an incident involving beer, and
that they used the terra "intoxicating liquor" in its commonly
accepted lay sense.

They had no reference to a criminal

statutory definition of what is or is not-1Q

But it wasn't beer.

was not beer.
else.

What they brought in there

It was beer diluted with ice and everything

It was»91 beer.
Q

Orange, black, strawberry soda, coca cola—
MR. SMITH:

This Board of Education construed the

conduct of these youngsters to be a violation of its
regulations, and they imposed a punishment.
Q

Well, I suppose—
MR, SMITH;

They have a remedy provided by the

State of Arkansas by their State courts,since 1909 the
Courts of Arkansas have been available to issue Writs of
Mandamus for wrongful suspensions.

Now, we submit there is

no Federal question involved in this somewhat ludicrous
case and that the Court of Appeals erred in remanding this

13
case for trial on the Plaintiffs' claim for damages in the,
amount of $90,000 against the School Board members in their
individual capacities.
The substance of our argument here is that this
case doesn't belong .in the Federal courts.

There is no

Federal interest in liberty or property involved in this
case.

There is nothing which would require or authorise

this Court or the Court of Appeals toconrj.ider whether or not
tlae -Soard made an error in applying its intoxicating beverage
rule to these facts.

There is no Federally-protected right

to set'aside an erroneous decision made' by a State officer,
be it the school district or anything else.

And we contend

that this is the dispositive issue in the case.

Whether.'We

agree or disagree with their finding that a violation had
occurred, or the assessment of the punishment, it is not
a matter that is protected or involves the United States
Constitution.
0

Your immunity claim was rejected below Ko, I

take it?
HR. SMITH5

Yes, Your Honor.

The Court of Appeals

stated that the standard by which the jury will determine
whether or not to award damages against these Board members
in their individual capacities

is good faith, objectively

determined.
Now, frankly, I don't know what that means, but X

would assume it means some standard calling for a judgment
as to whether they acted as reasonably prudent school board
members would have acted, without inquiring into their
actual state of mind.
Q

And you said there was something closer to

absolute immunity?
MR, SMITH:.
Court's opinion in the.

Yes, Your Honor,

We think that This

Rhodes Case, or coming from Kent

State, provides the very minimum standard that should be
employed.
Q

And there—
That is objective, good faith standard, I take it
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, if the Rhodes standard of

conduct is objective, then fine, because it does require an
actual inquiry into what the man was thinking at the time h
did it and whether he had reasonable cause-—
Q

I thought that was an "or15 in the Rhodes
MR. SMITH:

Q

I'm sorry, sir?

Either a subjective bad faith or objective bad

faith in Scheuar against Rhodes.
MR». SMITH:

Your Honor, the Rhodes Case

states

that immunity depends on the existence of reasonable
grounds for the belief formed at the time-”
Q

That's objective.
MR. SMITH:

—-in the light of the circumstances

coupled with good faith belief.

15
Q

Coupled with good faith belief—•
MR. SMITH;

Q

Yes.

--so it has to be —• so it's either/or?
MR. SMITH;

Yes, Your Honor.

And that is, in

fact, tie manner in which the District judge instructed
the jury.
Q

Are you satisfied with the Scheuer standard, or

hot

the Rhodes standard?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, we think, actually, that

there are grounds for absolute immunity here, but,.'frankly P
there is very little authority to support that argument,
Q

So you are not satisfied with it, but S&iiuer is--

Shoeless is - the law, isn't it, and the lower Court fj&Afern cv*: ed—
MR. SMITH;

Well, actually, Your Honor, the

District judge in his findings at the temporary restraining
ordeir hearing said,

"I find

that the School Board’ members'

had reasonable grounds to believe that their regulation had

,

been violated at the time they took their im.txa.jL action .inthis case."
As a matter of law, the damage issue should never
have been submitted* to the jury.
Q

Well, then, what did the Court of Appeals say?
MR. SMITH;

The Court of Appeals stated that they

could not say on the basis of this record that the defense
of good faith had been established as a matter of .1 sw.

Mow , 1 would point out to the Court that the
District judge had before him a good deal mors evidence
than did the Court of Appeals, because the trial transcript,

Appendix in the Court of Appeals.

It is in the record in

And we submit that an examination of

that would be illustrative of the actual good faith evidenced
by these School Board members.
Q

How was the Court of Appeals able to review the

District Court“s action •if there wasn’t a transcript of the
evidence?

What basis did it use to review it?
MR. SMITH;

It reviewed evidence which had bean

compiled at the Temporary Restraining Order hearing along
with Answers to Interrogatories and some other factual
material that was in the case, affidavits submitre V in
connection with motions.
Q

But you do maintain —

Q

One of your questions you want reviewed here

is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in its immunity
ruling?
MR. SMITH;
Q

Yes, sir.

Or its standard ruling, whatever you

want to

call it?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

It is undefined in terms of

whether it would permit someone who really believed they

17
were doing what they should be doing to foe found in good
faith.

As I read their Opinion, it would not.

It is a

question of what a reasonably prudent person would have been
doing under the same or similar circumstances.
Q

I. would suppose that Rhodes said you might sub­

jectively think you were in good faith, but it might be that
you didn't have reasonable grounds to think so, in which
event you are not immune under Rhodes,
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, as long as we don't get to

a position where somebody makes a wrong decision, a decision what comes to mind., the Kir stein Case where the issue, was
Whether the college officials had committed a constitutional
violation by excluding women from what had previously been an
all-male school. They did exclude them and the Court said
there was no reason at the time for them to assume This was
unlawful and we won't assess damages against them.

They made

a wrong decision, but they weren't liable for it.
One other point, which is very important, is that
the Board:all along has dealt with this case on the basis of
admitted facts.

There has never been any. controversy as to

a factual dispute, wifch the possible exception of whether
or not.this mixture was intoxicating.

And under these

circumstances, we submit that this is not an appropriate
vehicle for the Court to reach the issue of procedural due.

Q

Was the

Scheuer against Rhodes Opinion down

by the time the Court—I think not.
MR. SMITH:

I believe not, Your Honor.

I think

this was in April.
Q

It was not cited in the Opinion.
MR. SMITH:

Right, and the Court of Appeals

decision was in August of '73.
We would urge the Court, however, to examine
the question of whether there is in fact a federally”
protected right here to establish the requisite elements
of 1983.
We submit that Rodrigues stands for the proposition
that unless there is a total denial — and we don’t have
here a total denial.

We have an expulsion, or a suspension,

if you will, for a portion of one of 34 semesters' hftat a
phbl'ic school student in Arkansas will be attending school.
Extorts were made here to assure that these girls would

graduate with their class by taking one correspondence course
and one additional course to make up the two units they
missed.
And, in connection with the previous inquiry, I
believe of Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the last case as to
whether there is a property interest involved,-even the
District Court decision in Lopex against Gomes — or
Lope?, against Goss, I believe conceded that education did
not involve a property interest.

19
In Epperson against; Arkansas this Court said that
discretion to be accorded to public school officials is
extremely broad and that this Court should intervene only in
a clear case of constitutional violation.

And we respectfully

submit that this case involves no such clear case of
constitutional violation.
If the Court please. I'll save the remainder of my
time for rebuttal
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr.Core?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEN CORE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CORE:'

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, I would like to start out

by admitting what I am

afraid will become obvious before I vara finished, and that is,
I am not a constitutional lawyer, and neither am I a civil
rights 1 ax-rye r.
I was in two civil rights cases before this one,,
end one was settled and the other was tried and not appealed.
And this one has brought raa all the way to the U. S. Supreme
Court.
Probably I have read more Federal Court cases
since this case has been going than I had read at anytime
prior to that, and I still do not have any feeling of
competence really to discuss constitutional lav?.

20
But 1 have been in this case since before it was
a case,

And if I can help the Court in any way, perhaps it

would be more as a result of that than the ability to
discuss constitutional principles..
This case got its start when these parents and
children came to me to get me to help them get the School
Board to meet again.

They had been

spending -- this was

on the 24th of February ■— and they had spent the intervening
six days in an effort to get the Board to meet again to hear
them.
And I first declined to take the case at all, but
I did agree to go with them to see if I could get the Board
to meet again and go with them and we would get. on our knees ,
really, and beg for mercy, and see if we could get back in.
That was the beginning of the case.

And that was the

to the meeting of March 2nd, 1972.

And at that

time they had been out of school some eleven days.
Q

At that time were you representing the Wahl

girl?
MR. CORE:

Mo, sir.

The Wahl girl never came to

me, just Crain and Strickland, and I wish Wahl ha; because
she was a full blood Indian.
Q

A full blood what?
MR. CORE:

She was a full blood Indian.

But she

didn"t come.
Q

I-Iow is her name in the pleadings if she never—

21
MR. CORE:

She’s not in the pleadings, Jo Wahl

is not.
Q

I'm

curious, what, difference would that have

made?
MR. CORE:

Well, I think the District judge would

have ordered the School Board to put the kids back in school.
I think if we had had a member of a minority race—
G

You could have made it a racial case?
MR. CORE:

Well, again, I'm not. familiar with

those either.
Q

Who v?ss the District judge, Judge Williams?
MR. CORE:

Q

Yes, sir, 'Paul X. Williams.

And you feel that this would, have made a difference

as fax'* as—
MR. CORE:

Well, judging from what he said at. tl;e

first hearing. Your Honor, he said, "If these were little
Colored girls, I'd have to put them back in school."
they're white girls and, you know.

But

If that made a difference

to him, I think that might have helped, if we had had the
Indian.

And she had talked with the Superintendent and

asked him if she had to be and he said she didn't, and so
she didn't come.
So, really, the March 2nd meeting,

'72, it was

not a meeting that furnished either procedural or substantive
due process.
Q

Do you agree with Mr. Smith that there isn't any

dispute as to the facts here?
MR. CORF.s

No, sir, I do not.

He based that on

the fact that there was notdispute about this being an
alcoholic beverage or an intoxicating beverage.
Q

Apart from that one feature, is there any dispute

about the facts'?
MR. CORE;

Well, they have left out many facts

Q

Did you put on, or try to, these omitted, facts?
MR, CORE:

Yes, sir, they're in evidence.

We

tried the case for four days, but we did not bring that
record up simply because of the cost.

MR. CORE:

I have seen

Q

It never got to the Court of Appeals?
MR. CORE;

No, sir.

Q

And it may not be here then.

Q

Before the School Board did your clients contest

the basic factual claim that they.had gotten the so-called
malt beverage over in Oklahoma and put it in the punch bowl?
MR. CORE:

Your Honor, of course, they were not

at the February IB hearing at all.

But at the March 2 meeting

the whole procedure was for the girls to tell the School
Board what they did, and they did tell. When I say the
girls here, I mean the Plaintiffs, Miss Strickland and
Virginia Crain.

They did tell the Board exactly what they

had done.
Q

It’s a little cryptic to me. exactly What they

had done.

Was it what is alleged? that is, they went over

to Oklahoma and got some beer and brought it back and put
it in the punch bowl?
MR. CORE;
Q

Yes, sir.

There’s no dispute over that then?
MR. CORE;

That’s again leaving out what we think

are some important facts.
to go.

Jo Wahl was the one who xnew wnere

Virginia and Peggy didn’t.

And they went with her,

25

And then they came back to Mena and bought this King Kooler,
some 60 ounces of it and mixed it all together and then
took it to the campus.

And then there they added enough

water to make a gallon and a half.

So you have 7.68 ounces

of alcohol when they go up on the school ground.
Q

Isn't this all in the record here?

It seems to be

that what you have just said is familiar.
MR. CORE:

Yes, this is, or at least enough to make

the computation 7.68.
Q

I am curious as to what is still missing that you

are complaining about.
MR. CORE2

Well, all that's here, Your Honor, is

the two hearings which we held, one being on March •—•
Q

Yes, but the facts you have just recited, I certainly

read them somewhere, either in the briefs or in the Court of
Appe a1s opinion.
MR. CORE;

They're in that testimony that was

taken March 7th and April 7th.
Q

Well, whafe, in addition, is still missing?
MR. CORE;

Well, we had the parents testify.

We

had a doctor, hematologist testify about the effect of
three-quarters of an ounce of alcohol on an average man.
We had one of the School Board directors testify, two of
them — a Dr. Wood and Mrs. Goforth.

We had some of the

mothers there who attended this Mother-Daughter function and

26

didn’t, know there was anything in the spiking agent.
Q

Well, doesn’t

it. all cone down to v?hat. is the

difference between an intoxicant and an alcoholic?

Here there

is no argument, is there, about this being an alcoholic
beverage?

And i3 there any argument that it V7as non­

intoxicating, even under Arkansas?
MR. COREi

Yes, definitely, there is — well no, if

the School Board admits that it was not intoxicating, there
would be no argument because that is our position, that it
was not intoxicating.
Q

But they think for purposes of their rule that it

is intoxicating?
MR. CORE:

That's what they have held?
That’s the premise they proceeded under,

but the President of the School Board admitted under crossexamination that the girls had not violated the rule,
Q

Were you defending the Court of Appeals decision?
MR. CORE;

Q

Yes, sir.

And the grounds for it, your rationale for it?
MR, CORE;

Well, yes.

Do you mean from the

standpoint of whether or not the children should be given
any—
Q

No, as to the reason of the Court of Appeals

decision in your favor that there was no evidence of —
that there was an intoxicating beverage involved?
MR. CORE;

Yes, I think that's true that there

27
was none.

As a matter of fact, tine truth is it was not

intoxiaating.
Q

Was this illegal conduct in that county?
MR. CORE:

Only possession.

First it was not, Your Honor, because it did not
violate any lav; concerning intoxicating beverage.
Q

Did it violate any lav;?
MR. CORE:

Yes, it violated a law against possessing

beer that did not have the Arkansas tax paid on it.

And this

is why they got rid of the bottles before they cams back, I
suppose.

They said they poured it out in the milk carton

before they came back across the State line.

But, at any

rate, it is against the law to possess it without the
Arkansas tax being paid on it.
Q

So that you do not question that the girl's were

guilty of some illegal conduct?
MR. CORE:
Q'

True, Your Honor.

It is just a question of how you define that

illegal conduct?
MR. CORE:
Q

Right.

But, of course—

It is a question, isn’t it, whether or not the

girls engaged in conduct that is proscribed by the rule of
the School Board 3(b)?
MR. CORE:
Q

That’s true.

That’s the question.

28

MR, CORE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Or, more propertly, to what extent should a Federal

court in a 1983 action second guess a School Board decision
that that regulation was violated?
MR. CORE:

Well, I believe it is the procedural

problem—Q

Yes.
MR. CORE:

■—Your Honor, because if they had pro­

ceeded in a correct manner, then they would have determined
that there was no violation.
Q

But the School Board construes its own regulation

as meaning intoxicating is equivalent to alcoholic.

What*s

the Federal court got to do with that?
MR. COREs

Well, it's not really that point, that

I believe that there is Federal jurisdiction.

It’s the fact

that by the manner in which the School Board proceeded that
they had already pronounced a very serious judgment without
ever having found out that there was either no violation or
that it was very questionable whether there was any violation,
or that, even so, these two or three children were not such
as would justify this type of penalty.

In other words, how

far —* if they had proceeded in a correct manner, they would
never have pronounced this judgment.
Q

You are then pressing a procedural due process?
MR. CORE:

Yes, sir.

In fact the complaint, and

29
I take issue with Mr. Smith on that, the complaint attacks
the rule as being invalid because it’s mandatory and does not
permit consideration of mitigating circumstances.
Q

Is that a Federal claim.

You say the Constitution

prohibits the School Board from adopting a mandatory rule
like this and not take into consideration mitigating
circumstances?
MR. CORE:
Q

Yes, sir.

What case of ours do you rely on for that?
MR. CORE:

I'm sorry, I couldn't cite you a case.

But if it deprives them -— if they adopt a. rule which when
enforced will deprive them of a Federal right, then I would
say it is pertinent, the Federal courts xvould have the
right to declare it invalid.

And that's our contention here.

We attack the rule»
Q

Mr. Core, let me approach it from this end: Suppose

that this regulation spoke in terms of "alcoholic" rather
than "intoxicating beverages", would you be here?
A

Yes, sir, and I'm glad you made that point because,

yes, we think the procedure, in addition to the problem with
the rule, we think the procedure which the Board followed
is really the reason that they pronounced such a severe
judgment on a childish prank with girls that they had never
had any trouble with before.
is what led them into tills.

We think that their procedure

girls.

The teachers had done nothing except talk to the

And the girls knew nothing about what they had gotten

or what they put in there.

It could have been, anything.

And

any sort of respectable investigation would have demonstrated
that this was not “a serious matter calling for the type of
punishment, which they inflicted.
Q

Are you defending on the cruel and unusual punish­

ment?
MR. COPS:

Yes, sir, I think that's involved.

It

is cruel and unusual and I think also equal protection is
involved and we leaded it in the complaint.
0

Suppose two students were found sitting in the class

room drinking beer right out of the original bottles,, your
theory of this case would be exactly the same that the
School Board could not do what it. did here in the way that
it did?
MR. CORE:
. Q

Correct, yes.

So they could drink beer with impunity even though

it is illegal to possess it in that, county?
MR. COPE:
Honor.

No, t don't, believe that follows, Your

I would think this, that what should be done is the

children should be called in and it should be discussed, with
them and if, indeed, they just flagrantly violated the school
discipline by drinking beer, even though it is not included
in any rule, I think, certainly, discipline should be

31
inflicted on them,
Q

That brings us around to Mr, Justice Rehnquist's

question, just precisely how is that a Federal question?
MR. CORE:
Q

Well, we feel—

Federal or Constitutional question?
MR. CORE;

--that the State of Arkansas has pro­

vided this right or this opportunity for education, and
the procedure which they have followed in this case has de­
prived these children of the right to take advantage of that
education for a rather drastic period of time.
Q

Was

it the procedure or the beer?

MR. CORE:

-I. think it’s the procedure.

I really

do.
Q

But you do concede that the School Board would

have an inherent power to impose a punishment for drinking
this same beom in the classroom?
MR, CORE:
Q

I certainly do.

But they could not impose such a severe punishment

as was imposed here?
MR. CORE:

I agree with that, yes, sir.

Q

That's your point.

Q

We could disagree with the Court of Appeals, I

take it, on the ground that they abused here substantive
due process?
MR. CORE:

Yes.

32
Q

And you could still win on the procedural—
HR. CORF,:

Q

Yes, sir,

•—question, which the Court of Appeals didn’t

reach?
MR. CORE:
Q

Yes, Your Honor,

They bypassed that™

Except for one meeting. Tfifeyyssesi the first

meeting, February 18th meeting,

-

no procedural

due process?
MR. CORE:
Q

Right.

And they didn't decide the question with resoect

tc> the second, meeting?
MR. CORE:
Q

Right.

And, of course, you don't know why they bypassed

it?
MR. CORE:

No, sir, except apparently they were

satisfied on the deprival of substantive due process, end
didn't feel it necessary to pass on it,
Q

Do you think they felt the substantive due process

issue was easier than the procedural due process for the
second meeting?
MR. CORE:

I wouldn't hazard a guess on that,

Your Honor.
Q

girls?

Would you explain to me, too, the injury to these
As I indicated in my question to Mr. Smith, did they

lose a year’s, a whole year's time?

33

MR. COREs

Yes, sir.

What happened, they took

correspondence courses and so forth.

They lost the credit

for the entire year, and they had to repeat the entire
year.
Q

Doesn't the system work on a semester basis?
MR. CORE?

Q

It is a semester basis.

Then how did they lose a whole year?
MR. CORE:

Well, no, in fact, the Superintendent

testified that if — when you asked me if it would work on
a semester basis, true they do cut it into semesters, but
the Superintendent testified that it was the — that they
would fail the entire tenth grade, and have to repeat the
entire tenth grade.

He said that even if they were expelled

on their last day of the second semester, they lost the
entire year, because this was a penalty attached to being
expelled.
Q

That's what lie said.

And that's in the testimony.

Well, the Court of Appeals in Footnote 1 said the

practical effect of the suspension was to cause the girls to
fail their entire sophomore year,
MR. CORE:
Q

That's right«

That3s what the Court of Appeals said, but I want

to know whether it is a correct statement.
MR. CORE: It is, indeed, a correct statement.
Q
statement

Well, Mr, Smith told us it was an incorrect

MR. CORE:

Right/ and I have to disagree with

Mr. Smith on that.
0

Well, at least, the girls missed three months of

school and. of course, they had to make up

in the next

three months of school.
MR. CORE:
Q

No question of that.

Six months, now that’s a long time.
MR. CORE: And it would have been subject matter

which wouldn't have been covered until the second semester.
Q

That's right.
MR. CORE:

Which meant they would have to lay out

an entire year.
Now, I think, really, the factual basis of the case
is that it is so compelling that Mr. Smithsays dire consequence
if we hold that a Federal court has jurisdiction in this
type situation.

I would really rather look at it this way,

is what's going to happen if Federal courts do not take
jurisdiction in this type situation?
Q

They'd go into the State courts.
MR. CORE:

Q

Well, that's true, but—

Wasn't that the custom until just a few years ago?
MR. CORE:

Well, in my — I have been practicing

a little over — well, I'm on my twenty-fourth year, and I
don't recall any suits like this before.

I don't remember

reading any in the Arkansas Supreme Court Reports except that

35
one real old case where the father brought suit against the
School Board,:

and they held that he had no interest in it.

And that's the only case that I know of.
Q

Well, isn't this just a new-fashioned kind of

case, that when you and I were in Elementary school and we
got bounced out, we went home and nobody made a Federal case
out of it?
MR. COREs

That’s true, back in the days of

paternalism that our District judge referred to when he
heard the case.
Q

You have good courts in Western Arkansas, don't

you?
MR. COREs
Q

I say you have working courts in Western Arkansas?
.MR. CORE:

Q

I beg your pardon?

Do you mean State courts?

Yes, sir,
MR. CORE:

Yes, sir.

And, of course, I've been

in them quite often and I am personally acquainted with
the judges,
Q

Isn't that where Judge Williams carae from?
MR. CORE:

Yes, sir, he came from Booneville,

which is only 35 miles from Fort Smith.
Q

You mean he came from the State side on the

judiciary?

He was a State judge, a State Chancery judge?

MR. CORE:

He spent over 20 years as a Chancery

36

judge, before he was a District judge»
Q

Where is Mena?

Q

In Polk County»
MR. CORE:

It's in Polk County.
Q

Right.

It's basically a small town community?
MR. CORE:

Q

It's the county seat.

Of Polk County?
MR. CORE:

Q

It's 85 miles south of Fort Smith.

It is some 4500 population.

And the School Board has county-wide jurisdiction,

doss it?
MR. CORE:

No, sir, there are, I believe two or

three — three other consolidated schools in tlie county.

And

so their jurisdiction would be limited to their district,
which is the Mena School District.
'

Q

Which is Mena, which is basically the Town of Mena?
MR. CORE: Right.

Q

And a population of less than 5,000, you say?
MR. CORE:

Right.

And, of course, the judges know

all the school directors and you made a good point, Justice
Blapkmun, if you will read what Judge Williams said, you will
see how reluctant he was to order the School Board to do what
he fully believed they ought to do.

And I think you would

have the same problem with the other good judges there, and
I don't mean to 'criticise them.

I have a great deal of

37
respect for them.

But you get away from that when you get

into Federal court most of the time.

We didn’t here because

Judge Williams was from Booneville, and had been on the
School Board and so forth.

As I say, he’s a good friend of

mine and Icertainly don’t criticize him, but he expressed
his great reluctance to order the school directors to do
what he was telling them, in effect, they ought to do.
Q

But he didn't actually order them to do anything,

did he?
MR. CORE:

Wo, sir, he never did.

He let it go

on to a jury and then he sustained these motions for
judgment notwithstanding no verdict.

But, again, as I

say, I think the factual basis for the way these children
were handled is the most compelling argument that I can
make, that the Federal courts should take jurisdiction and
should provide a remedy.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Core.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Smith?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, if I might briefly

address the issue of procedural due process.
As has been noted, the Court of Appeals
acknowledge that the March 2, ’72 hearing may have cure$
any prior procedural defect.

Indeed, the students and

their counsel were granted every benefit that they claim

38

in their brief.

They had notice of the meeting.

They had

a statement of facts upon which the action was taken at the
inception of the meeting.

They had the opportunity to appear,

to present any witnesses they could present.
represented by counsel.

They were

And. if that doesn’t constitute

procedural due process in the public school context, then I
don’t know what does.
The procedural due process issue will not sustain
what the Court of Appeals has done.

J. would assume that if a

defect is found in the procedures, the remedy is to remand the
case and give them a new hearing.
Now what on earth are they going to do when we give
them a new.hearing?

What kind of evidence would be presented

at that point that hasn’t already bear, presented?
The point is that the School Board construed its
regulations to reach alcoholic beverages.

Mrs, Goforth, a

School Board member, testified at the trial that when the
rule" was enacted there was no discussion of e legs' definition
of an intoxicating liquor; that the words '’intoxicating'' and
’’alcoholic" were synonymous.
Q

Have these children graduated now?
MR. SMITEi

Your Honor, that is not in the record.

I will be happy to answer
Q

the question.

Well, have they?
MR. SMITHs

Yes, sir, with their class.

Q

Their sophomore year ended June of '72, didn't

it?
MR. SMITH;

That's correct, Your Honor.

They

graduated this past spring.
Q

They made up the year then?
MR. SMITH;

Yes, sir, by talcing a correspondence

course and one other extra course.
Q

Now, let's assume for the moment — let’s as surae

just for the moment that the School Board, that the Court
of Appeals is reversed but the case is remanded and the
Court of Appeals

held that there was a denial of procedural

due process, that the suspension had been imposed not in
accordance with the Constitution, but in violation of the
due process clause.

Let’s just assume that.

That as far

as they can tell validly there was good cause to throw them
out?
MR. SMITH;

I would assume that under those

circumstances—
Q

Would there be a remedy in which damage—
MR. SMITH;

There would be a possibility that

the students would pursue their damage claim against the
individual school board members, since they have had to
at least make up two courses.
It was a serious punishment.

The point is whether

any of the Federal Judiciary agrees with whether it was a

40

punishment or not.

The point is whether it was a decision

that this School Board is entitled fee make.

The Bosrd is in

a county in which the citizens of the county have made a
decision that they think the possession or sale of alcoholic
beverages is a serious matter.

And we submit that, this

Honorable Court should not intervene to substitute its
judgment for that of the School Board.
Q

In other words, you are saying that a Federal

question does not arise out of a mare mistake of judgment
by the School Board?
MR. SMITH:

Yes P Your Honor,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Justice Blackmun

has a question.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMU1J:

Wo, sir.

(Whereupon, at 3:00 o’clock p.m. the argument was
concluded.
