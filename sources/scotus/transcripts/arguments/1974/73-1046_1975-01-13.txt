ORAL ARGUMENT CF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS» SHAPIROs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
This case is here on direct appear by the government
from a decision of a three-judge District Court in Florida.
Like the previous case, it involves a challenge to
the federal government's power to classify on the basis of
alienage.
The appellees here are three aliens who wish to
enroll in a subsidized federal medical insurance program for
the elderly.
This program is part of the over-all Social Security
Insurance System for people over 65.

That system consists of

three parts;
First, there's

the basic retirement insurance,

which is Old Age and Survivor's Insurance.

Eligibility for

that insurance is based on age and work in covered employment.
Citizenship or alienage has almost nothing to do with it.
And almost all employment in this country is covered.

4
Second, there’s hospitalization insurance, which is
referred to as Medicare Part. A,

And eligibility is based

primarily on entitlement to the basic retirement insurance»
The third category is the one involved in this
litigation, that is Medicare Part B, supplemental medical
insurance,
Part B is a voluntary program.
currently $6,70 a month

Those who enroll

which the government matches.

The

fund created by these contributions pays 80 percent of covered
medical expenses, and they are mainly doctor’s fees and
medication.
Appellees are all over 65.

They want to enroll in

Medicare, sub part B, but they were refused because Part B
insurance is available only to persons who are eligible for
Part A insurance, to citizens, or to aliens admitted for
permanent residence who have actually been residents for
five years.
All three named appellees entered this country in
1971, so they don't meet the five-year residence requirement.
In addition, two ,of the appellees were admitted under
the special Cuban Refugee Program and not for permanent
residence.

So, on that ground also, they are ineligible for

Medicare Part B.
The Cuban Program does permit a retroactive
adjustment of status, so that by the time these two appellees

5

have been here for five years? they probably will be eligible
for Medicare Part B, since their status will have been
adjusted to that of permanent resident aliens.
This is a class action.

And the court below defined

the class as all immigrants denied enrollment in sub part B,
because they are not lawfully admitted for permanent residence,
and have not met the five-year residency requirement.
It also established a sub class represented by
single appellee, Espinosa, of those denied benefits solely
because they could not meet the durational residence require­
ment.
The court held that the durational residence
requirement denied appellees equal protection because it was
not rationally related to any valid congressional purpose,
It also held that the durational residence require­
ment was not separable from the requirement that the alien be
lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

And therefore it

struck all the alienage provisions from the Medicare sub part
B eligibility provision.
We've discussed the separability issue in our brief,
and I don't propose to discuss that further this afternoon.
It is our contention here, as it was in the
preceding case, that equal protection analysis is simply
inappropriate when considering federal statutes dealing with
alienage, in view of tie basis and extent of Congress' broad

6
powers over immigration,,
And the Solicitor General presented that view this
morning, and I don't propose to go into that again.
I do want to Dcinfc out that the Medicare eligibility
provision at issue here is closely related to immigration
policy.

As a matter of fact, the court below rather

surprisingly indicated that it had doubts about the
constitutionality of the admitted for permanent residence
requirement part of the statute, precisely because it was so
closely related to the policy expressed in the Immigration Act.
The Immigration Act provides that one of the qualifi­
cations for admission as an immigrant is that the applicant not
be likely to become a public charge.
Now, the pre.cfcical effect of that requirement,
particularly for people over 60, the only ones that are
affected by this Medicare provision, is that they must either
be economically independent or have someone in this country idio
is willing to assume responsibility for their support.
The Medicare limitation simply defines the extent
of the support obligation.

The effect of the immigration

statute and the Medicare statute, taken together, is the same
as if Congress had explicitly provided in the Immigration Act
that elderly .immigrants must undertake to provide for their
own medical needs for live years after they enter, either by
private insurance or by having the financial capability of

7
doing ifc independently of insurance.
Congress could, certainly have done — made that
provision directly in the Immigration Act.

We submit that

Congress has an equal right to do it indirectly through the
Medicare Act.
It's the essence of congressional power over
immigration to decide which groups it will encourage to
immigrate and which discourage.

And also to decide how much

encouragement it will offer.
An elderly person considering immigration will
normally consider the cost of living in this country.
of that cost is the cost of medical care.

Part

If subsidised

government insurance is available, the cost will be lower
than if it is not.

And if it's available after five years, t

the cost is less than if it’s not available at all.
Immigration is thus encouraged by malting the
insurance available, but it's not encouraged as much as it
would be if the insurance "was available immediately on entry.
Congressional judgments concerning immigration
policy are entitled to great judicial deference.

And this

Medicare eligibility provision is an expression of
congressional immigration policy.

As such, it's entitled to

great judicial deference.
For that reason, even if this judgment is subject to
review on equal protection grounds, the Court need do no more

8
than assure itself that there's a rational justification for
the restrictions on alien eligibility.

And there is such a

justification in this case.
The Part B Medicare program is part of the over-all
Social Security Insurance Program.

That program is not

basically a welfare program, in which payments are based on
current needs.

There’s no means test for eligibility.

Instead, the insurance is available to those to whom
Congress has determined that the country owes an obligation.
This Court has in fact recognized that that sense of
obligation is the basis of the original Social Security
Program, which is, of course, the rootstock of the whole
federal social insurance program,particularly for the elderly.
If I may quote from Flemming v. Hestor, the program
is based on a legislative judgment that those who, in their
productive years, were functioning members of the economy,
may justly call on that economy in their later years

for

protection from the rigors of the poorhouse.
In setting up the Part B eligibility provisions,
\

Congress went somewhat further.

It extended the benefits to

all citizens and to aliens with a substantial relation to this
country; but the theory remained the same.
Congress simply recognized that resident aliens,
like citizens, pay taxes, are subject to military service,
and contribute in myriad other ways to our national community.

9
Citizens,who, in the overwhelming majority of cases, make
these contributions throughout their lives, may not enroll
in sub Part B until they are 65.

An alien, who makes his

myriad contributions in his country of origin during his
working life, may retire and come here and after only five
years of contributing to this community, he's eligible to
enroll in Medicare sub Part B on the same basis as a citizen.
That's not, certainly, an unreasonable discrimina­
tion against the alien.

In fact, the only person that's

more favorably treated would be a U. S. citizen who had never
lived in this country and then returned in his old age and
was immediately eligible for the Medicare sub Part B.
And that, we submit, is such a small group that it's really
de minimis.
QUESTION: Well, wouldn't it also —■ wouldn't an
American citizen who hadn't been under the Social Security
Act or the Railroad Retirement Program, and who reached 65,
be more favorably treated?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No, because the principle there is

that he has been a participating member of this community.
QUESTION: But not of any Social Security Program.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Not of a Social Security Program.

But my point is that he has been living here, and
he has been subject to —
QUESTION:

Well, maybe he -- but we don't know if

10

he’s bean a net asset or a net liability to American society.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well? the theory of the Act is —

He's been living here, and that may be —

MRS. SHAPIRO:

He's been living here and he's been

contributing —
QUESTION: Well,
MRS. SHAPIRO:

— as.a member of the community.

Congress decided that five years of participation
in the national community is enough for eligibility for
Medicare Part B„

It could have made the period longer,

or it could have made it shorter.

It drew the line at five

years.
Under traditional equal protection analysis, this
Court should not decide whether that was the best place to
draw the line.

The line is, however, consistent with the

Immigration Act, which also uses five years as the period
in which the alien is in soma ways here on probation.
His native country remains more responsible for him during
that period than it is after five years.
For ex ample, he ordinarily can't be -- or he can be
deported for indigency within five years, or for a single
crime which involves moral turpitude committed within that time.
Of course, too, he may not ordinarily be naturalised
until he has been here for five years, so that until that time
there can be no full assumption of the rights of citizenship,

11
nor total dissolution of the bond x-7ith his native country,
We submit, therefore, that the distinction between
citizens and aliens in the Medicare program is not unreason­
able.

It

also serves the rational fiscal purpose of

reducing the amount of the federal subsidy required for the
program.
The court below thought that the government did not
benefit financially from postponing the eligibility of
aliens, except to the extent that they died.
It made two assumptions not supported by the record.
First, it assumed that no elderly aliens returned to
their native country before five years are up.
And second, that they postponed needed care, which
it further assumed made the eventual cost to the government
of the insurance as great as if they were eligible immediately.
The Immigration Service does not have records of
how many elderly immigrants leave the country within five
years.
And the second assumption is pure speculation.
Of course, if it’s true, it's equally irrational
to deny benefits to those who have not yet reached 65,
because they, too, will postpone necessary care which could
have been provided more cheaply before they reached 65.
Anyway, we submit that these are certainly
legislative judgments.

This is a novel program, which has

12
been under constant legislative review, and it is up to
Congress to evaluate all these factors and decide whether and
how much to liberalize eligibility for Medicare.
18d like to reserve the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Feinberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED FEINBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FEINBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of

the Courts
It seems to me that Mrs. Shapiro's argument rests
primarily on Mr. Bork’s original argument, which was that the
Fifth Amendment notions of equal protection do not apply to
aliens.
I£ that is true, and that is what this Court holds,
then I think this case folds for me, for my clients.
I think the case argued previously folds.
But I don't believe that that is true, because that
is such an overwhelmingly inconsistent and novel argument
that implicit within it are the following:
That a classification which this Court has now held
three times, explicitly once but implicitly two other times,
and many other courts have followed, that is, a classification
of aliens is not inherently suspect when that classification
is made by the federal government rather than the States.

13

Two, that the normal test of whether a classifica­
tion is justified or not justified, a classification involving
individual worth as opposed to classifications involving
economics and taxes.

And we're dealing here with individual

worth.
The normal test, which has to do with the relation­
ship of the classification to the objective of the statute,
is inapplicable, and in fact this wasn't even spoken about
here.
The reason it wasn't spoken about is because of the
submission by the government to this Court twice now this
morning that the federal government can discriminate against
aliens as aliens in any way they see fit.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't think the argument went

quite that far.
MR. PEINBERG:

Well, I think Mr. Bork's argument

did, and in the brief that was filed by the government in this
case, the argument repeated at least four times was that the
government has made the discrimination in this case against
aliens, has made the classification in this case against
aliens, and indeed in virtually all of those statutes which
are listed in the appendix attached to the Wong brief, the
government's Wong brief, because the aliens have not shown a,
quote, "substantial and enduring connection with the United
States sufficient for the United States Government to grant

14
them the benefits that are granted tc citizens under each of
those particular provisions»"

The one we're talking about

here are Medicare B provisions.
Well, substantial and enduring connection with the
United States is really saying aliens, and when you compare
aliens with citizens, citizens have an absolute and enduring
connection with the United States,.

So those who do not have

— relative to citizens, those who do not have a substantial
and enduring connection with the United States are aliens.
Now, if that's the basis of the discrimination, and it is
asserted repeatedly, in fact it has said it is the theme of
the discrimination, the theme of the classifications in each
of these cases, is chat the underlying — the underlying theme,

I think the words are used, are that they do not have a
substantial and enduring connection with the United States.
Well, this is advancing a new test of legislation
which creates classifications, because the test, the traditional
test — and I’m not talking about the test now that is used for
suspect classifications, or where there are fundamental
interests involved, or any special circumstances, just the
traditional test — is the one articulated in a case which did
not involve a suspect classification, it involved the question
of whether a conscientious objector could receive the same
benefits as a veteran after having finished his conscientious
objector service.

15
And .he said that he was discriminated against because
he served his country just as veterans who had fought in the
war.
This Court upheld that discrimination in that
classification in that case.
But the Court went on to say that?
"Our analysis of the classification proceeds on the
basis that, although an individual's right to equal protection
of the laws 'does not deny ... the power to treat different
classes of persons in different ways'... it denies the power
to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons
placed by statute into different classes on the basis of
criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute.
A classification 'must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must
rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and sub­
stantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that
all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike'."
Now here we are told that there is a new test, we
do not look at the object of the statute.

In Medicare the

object of the statute is to take care of retirement-age
individuals' medical problems.
In this case, Medicare Part B is related to physician
services generally.

I give you seme idea.

There are home

health care services, podiatrist services, outpatient services?
those kind of services are the kind of services that are

16
involved in the Medicare Part B.

There's some more of then,

but you can get the idea of those services.
To distinguish from Part A, really, which deals with
hospitalization benefits; Part B, they usually talk about
medical benefits, which are doctor*s services.
QUESTION: Both Part A and Part B are available only
to people over 65 years old, is that right?
MR. FEINBERG:

That is correct.

But there is a

substantial difference in the way they are funded, which is
very interesting.
Part B is funded from the general revenues of the
Treasury of the United States.

That is the tax dollar.

That

is the money that comes from income taxes and however else the
revenues of the United States receive its moneys.
It does not come from Social Security taxes.
QUESTION: And those are matching funds in Part B;
right?
MR. FEINBERG:
QUESTION:

Match —- yes —
Fifty-fifty.

MR. FEINBERG:

Because every applicant for Part B

must pay a premium, --QUESTION: Right.
MR. FEINBERG:

— which is matched by the Treasury of

the United States, —
QUESTION:

From the general revenue funds.

17
MR. FEINBERG:

— from the general revenue funds.

That is correct.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. FEINBERG: And so, while it is true that Part B,
and it is natural that Part B should follow Part A and it is
called the Medicare program, and it is within the purview of
the Social Security Act, which is all of Title 42, is called
a Social Security provision.

In reality, Social Security

has very little to do with it, the Social Security to the man
in the street.
It has to do with somebody’s choosing to participate
— it’s a voluntary program, somebody who is 65 years old
choosing to seek insurance that is available pursuant to
congressional enactment, for which a premium is paid by the
applicant, and a like premium or an equal premium, part of
the premium is paid by the taxpayers.
Those taxpayers not only include aliens, but the
children of aliens, and anybody related to aliens who are living
in the United States.
So the argument that an alien is here only for five
years and is contributing only for five years is a specious
argument, particularly when we look at -— and the problem in
this case really arose, definitionally.
here that we're talking about is;

The classification

An alien lawfully admitted

for permanent residence, who has resided in the United States

18
continuously during the five years immediately preceding the
month in which he applies for the benefits.
So we have two residency requirements here:

a

durational residency requirement and a status residency
requirement.
The status being that of permanent resident.
And forgetting for a moment about the durational
residency requirement? which was declared unconstitutional
by the District Court in this case, and going to the question
of the status residency requirement for a moment, it is to be
noted that the problem arises because of the nature of, or
the manner in which Cuban refugees were allowed to come into
the United States.

Indeed, "allowed" is a very conservative

word,
Thc36 of us who have lived in this country for the
last ten years know that President Eisenhower made a speech
in which he beseeched the Cubans who wanted to escape from
Castro's Cuba —- Castro taking over in Cuba in 1959 ; tills
speech was made, I believe, in 1961 — to come into the United
States, inducing them to come into the United States, to the
point where we started sending planes during the 1960's to
pick up anybody who Castro would allow onto those planes, to
bring them into the United States.
So, here we begged these people to come into the
United States.

And thousands and thousands and thousands of

19
them came.

Indeed, it is estimated that approximately 600 to

700 thousand came.
And of those numbers, approximately 250,000 to 300,000
— the figures are inaccurate — they were coming in such great
numbers that they x*era overwhelming the agencies that were
taking care of them.

And coming from Miami, Florida, I am

quite familiar with the chaos

that xvas caused by these

enormous numbers of Cubans coming into the community.
The bureaucratic problems of counting them, for
example, and analyzing what their status v?as, and figuring
out how to allow them into the United States under the then
current laws of the United States was a very serious problem.
At the beginning, when they were trickling in,
they came in as non-immigrants.

And when the non-immigrant

visa ran out, they x^ere then subject to deportation proceedings.
During the deportation proceedings, they claimed
political asylum and it was granted to them.

This was a very

cumbersome process.
When they claimed political asylum, they became
immigrants.

Once they became immigrants, they qualified for

the Medicare Part B provision, because the definition of
"immigrant" is "a person admitted for permanent residence."
So those who were fortunate enough to be defined as
immigrants, x^hich was just fortuitous, depended on when and
how they came into this country, are qualified for Medicare

20

Part B.
But as the numbers increased and they became

■ they

started coming in by the thousands, a more efficient way had
to be found to allow them to come in.

tod the more efficient

way was to choose to allow them to come in under the parole
powers of the Attorney General of the United States, which are
— which give the Attorney General the power to allow
virtually any foreigner into the United States, any alien
into the

United States under any conditions.
He has

this power is given to him by Congress, and

it is very, very wide and broad power — a wide and broad power.
And so approximately 250 to 300 thousand people came in.
Now, the problem with those people coming in is what
brings us before this Court.
classification was parolee,

Because they came in as — their
tod a parolee, as we point out in

our brief, is neither an immigrant nor a non-immigrant; he is
in a special status of parolee.
And the term which is used, referring now to the
statute term, resident — "an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent residence" does not cover oarolee.

The historical

development of the definition of that term does not cover
parolee.
So now we have, it's estimated by the lower court and
my calculations are about the same, on the basis of the sketchy
figures that we have, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of

21
20,000 individuals who are parolees.
QUESTION 2

Is your real complaint that he*s

designated as a parolee rather -than a resident alien?
MR. FEINBERG:

That is one of the complaints.

If

he was designated as a resident —
QUESTION;

Yes.

What good is that complaint when

certainly Congress has the right, under its immigration laws,
to decide which is which?
MR. FEINBERG:
QUESTION:

Isn't that one of Congress's rights?
To bn —

Th it he's either admitted as a resident

alien or parolee.
That's a right of itmugration, and naturalization.
MR. FEINBERG:

/y answer to that is that — I have a

twofold answer to that.
No. 1, that you inmt -— when that classification if
used —
QUESTION:

You admit, your complaint is that he's a

parolee rather than a resides: alien.
MR. FEINBERG:

No.

Lly complaint is that the

classification is used to excl ide h>i from Medicare Part B.
QUESTION: Well, this —
MR. FEINBERG:

That’s my complaint.

QUESTION:

If he was a resident alien, he would be

QUESTION:

That is one law —

all right.

22
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:

— perhaps he's admitted for permanent

residence.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FEINBERGs

Righ t.

Right.

That's right.

The complaint

is —
QUESTION:

So your complaint is that when he was

admitted, he was given the wrong status.
MR. FEINBERGs

Not the wrong status.

He could be

admitted —
QUESTION:

Well, if you took that position, I think

you're in a whole lot of trouble.
MR. FEINBERGs

No.

That's not the wrong status.

He could have been admitted under any status.

The question is

what they did with that status after he was admitted.
And I'm submitting to the Court that the status of
parolee does not fit within the objective and purpose of
Medicare Part B, which is the test of the classification.
Now, I have no argument with him being a parolee.
My argument is utilizing that parolee classification to deny
him the benefits of Medicare Part B.
What is the relationship between taking care of a
retirement-age alien who resides in the United States and the
fact that he is a parolee?

There is no relationship.

The

only relationship is that he is an alien, and their argument

23

is a circular argument.

Their argument is he is an alien,

and we can do whatever we want with aliens, regardless of
the relationship between the objective of the statute which
excludes him and the fact that he is an alien.
Those --- those two facts? one,that the person is an
alien or is a parolee or has any condition of alienage, and,
two, that the object of the statute is to take care of
individual's medical problems when they reach retirement age,
are totally unrelated.

And this is why this is not discussed

in the government's brief.
Because if the true test of determining whether a
class is a proper classification, a classification that can
be sustained constitutionally, is iviiether it’s related to the
objective of the statute, we find that the classifying aliens
are totally unrelated to the objective of the statute.
The objective of the statute is set out in the statute? it’s
to take care of people's medical problems when they're 65 years
*

old.
What does that have to do with whether somebody is
a citizen or an alien?

That's not discussed by the government,

because there's no argument that can be made relating the
objective of the statute to the classification that's
created.
What I am saying is that the problem that has brought
me to the Court is the fact that they have utilized the

24
parolee, the government has utilized the parolee status of
these people, to exclude them irrationally and arbitrarily
from a program which has nothing to do with their status as
parolee.
That’s like excluding garbagemen and policemen or
plumbers.
There's an arbitrary exclusion from this statute.
And their argument
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that there's some plenary

power in Congress to deal with garbagemen and plumbers, to take
your illustrations, that's comparable to that over immigration?
MR. FEINBERG:

I was using that example to talk about

the arbitrariness.
What I’m saying is that the so-called plenary power
of Congress that has to do with aliens must be related — and
this argument has already been made already —- must be related
to naturalization, deportation, admittance

into the United

States, even citizenship.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with the somewhat provisional

concession that Mr. Steinman made in the previous case, that
the United States could simply exclude all aliens, and say
that no one could come into this country?
MR. FEINBERG:
QUESTION:

I don't think that that —'

Is that it?

MR. FEINBERG:

I don't think that would be provisional.

25
I think that the same degree as —
QUESTION:

I said his provisional concession —

MR. FEINBERG:

Mo, I think you misworded that

completely.
QUESTION:

Because he withdrew it.

his right hand and took it back with is left.

He gave it with
He said when

that case came up, he'd take the other position.
MR. FEINBERG:

If Your Honor please, I think — I

think what he said was that if you allowed aliens to come in
under certain conditions, that he might question those
conditions.

But I don't think he would challenge a statement

that Your Honor has just made, and that is that the United
States simply can close its doors to aliens.
QUESTION:

I think that —■

But in any event, you don't challenge it,

do you?
MR. FEINBERG:

I don't —■ I don't challenge it at

all.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FEINBERG:

I think the United States certainly

can close its doors to aliens.

But it hasn't.

And it hasn't

tied these conditions to naturalization or admittance or
deportation.
QUESTION:

So, if it had, suppose that Congress

were to do that, what would your view be of that?
MR. FEINBERG:

I'd give the same provisional agree-

example, which was mentioned by my worthy opponent — where
you tie — I pick that case because it's a very controversia),
case, and I think it was a four-to-three decision, which —
the validity of which has been questioned through the years.
But there's a case in which, seemingly a very
arbitrary exclusion from it, a deportation took place, and this
Court upheld that.
Well, that's because that was tied to deportation.
And that's where the plenary power of Congress comes in:
deportation.

Immigration in terms of naturalization —

Yes, but he was a deportee.

But it was tied to deportation.

And there is not one

case, not one of all these cases, and I have read them all
carefully, that is cited by the appellants in this case,
which justifies the proposition of imposing conditions upon
aliens within this country that are unconnected with naturaliza­

sovereignty, powers of citizenship, —
QUESTIONs

What about provisions against becoming an

indigent?
MR. FEINBERG:

The — that’s tied to naturalization.

Yes.
They say that if you come into this country as an
indigent, then you have violated the Naturalization — you’ve
committed a fraud because you can't come into tills country as
an indigent unless you post a bond.
But that’s a condition of Naturalization.

I am

And you say it isn't.

MR. FEINBERG;

There’s nothing — not only is it not

in there, in literal words of the statute, which are in the
Social Security Act, but it is not even there or mentioned in
the legislative history.

They don’t talk about the question of

naturalization or admittance into this country or anything
related to that in the passage of this provision, or, indeed,
in the passage of most of the Acts which are listed in the
Appendix to the government’s Wong brief.
QUESTION:

So this -- this prohibition against

sharing in the Schedule B benefits, this is unconstitutional
because it's in the Social Security Act rather than in the
Immigration Law?
MR. FEINBERG:
to that.

I would give my provision pertaining

That’s not the question before this Court.

The

question — the test of the constitutionality --- again I'll
relates

The test of the constitutionality of a classification

is related to the object of the benefit conferred by the
legislation.

That's been the traditional test that this

Court has used time and time again, unrelated to the fact
that a classification may be inherently suspect, which we
have here, unrelated to the fact that a fundamental right is
involved here, such as medical care? unrelated to any of those
matters.
The traditional and consistent test has been whether
or not the classification is related to the object or purpose

29

of the statute from which the class is denied benefits, and
that is not the test that the government would urge this Court
to use

in this case.
The test that the government urges this Court to use

is simply to say that since these people are aliens, the
government has a right to exclude them from any benefits
conferred on citizens.

QUESTIONS

Your position is that these immigrant

aliens are the same as resident aliens?
MR. FEINBERG:

No,

QUESTION:

Well, have you made any effort to change

the status to resident alien?
MR. FEINBERGs
QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir?

Have you made any effort to change these

people's status to resident aliens?
MR. FEINBERG:

These people are not in a position,

because of the laws of the United States, to seek that change
until they have been here, in theory for two years, in practice
for four years ? and they have not been here for that length
of time.
QUESTION:

So this is close to the visitor’s

visa, isn't it?
MR. FEINBERG:

No.

On the contrary, there's a whole

section in my brief which addresses itself to that question.
It is much closer to an irrmiigrant.

For several reasons.

Those are the people who are -—
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't they have had their status

MR. FEINBERG:

Soma could have.

The particular

QUESTION:

Because they haven't been here long

They just got here.
MR. FEINBERG:

That's — no, they've been here since

1971, but it takes four years before they can qualify to
become immigrants, which is permanent resident.
QUESTION:

So what is all that argument about

President Eisenhower got to do with them?
MR. FEINBERG:

Because — because — but for the

fact that all of these Cubans were invited into this country
and are here now.

The provisions of Medicare Part B would not

affect that many people.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't an immigrant affected, from

the standpoint of your case?
MR. FEINBERG:
and that's the point.
vision, in the SSI

Well, it does — it did to Congress,
Because Congress, in a related pro­

statute, took up the question of the alien

32
who comes in as a parolee* and here we're talking about
indigents, whereas in the case before the Court we're not
necesarily talking about indigents»
And what Congress did was, they said the following —
this is an Act of Congress that I'm reading from.
Congress has authorized welfare payments to the
indigent, blind, aged, and disabled individual who is, and I
quote now, "either (i) a citizen or (ii) an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent resident, or otherwise permanently
residing in. the United States under color of law", continuing
the statute, "including any alien who is lawfully present
in the United States as a result of the provisions of Section
1153(a)(7)" which is conditional entrant, which is in the class
that's included by the lower court in this case, "or section
1182(d)(5)" which is parolee.
So, in other words, what Congress has done here is
include in the SSI provisions of the Social Security Act
coverage for the persons who are excluded from the Medicare B
provisions of the Social Security Act.
And no doubt it was an inadvertent failure on the
part of Congress to do that, but tve are submitting that it is
possible for this Court to construe the admittance for permanent
residency requirements as covering Cuban parolees, because of
the fact that they are covered here, because of the fact that
since 1971 they must not only have registered for the military

33

service, but are subject to induction in the military service,
as are citizens, and because of the fact that they are entitled
to retroactive adjustment of status, which non-immigrants are
not entitled to generally, with some exceptions; after two
years present in the United States they can make an applica­
tion for retractive adjustment of status to become immigrants.
Actually it takes four years to get that retractive adjust­
ment, and that's why I said my clients could not receive it.
They came in 1971, and we haven't — the four years hasn't
elapsed yet.
QUESTION?

Your clients are residents, are they not?

MR. FEINBERG:

My clients are —

MR. FEINBERG:

the United States under color of laxv.

And then it goes on to

specifically say that it includes parolees.
QUESTION;

And that would be your

MR. FEINBERG;

—

So I’m saying that the congressional

definition now has changed what has been the traditional
definition, and we now have people who are parolees, who, in
contemplation of law enacted by Congress, in another statute,
admittedly, but a parallel statute, within the Social Security
Act, by the way, supplemental security income, are permanently
residing in the United States under color of law.

That's the

language, that's the statutory language that's used.
And that’s on page 42 of the brief.
QUESTION;

And it also says he shall not legally,

MR. FEINBERG;
QUESTION;

Excuse me, sir?

It does not ordinarily place him, quote,

"legally within the United States".

That's what your lower

court decision says.
MR. FEINBERG:

That is the traditional definition

35

of parolee.
What I'm saying is that Congress has changed that.
QUESTION?
QUESTIONS

I see.

Okay.

Mr. Feinberg, this is probably totally

unimportant, but I'm interested in the compliance with the
three-judge court statute.
Originally Judge Fulton was designated as the
receiving judge, and then was replaced by Judge King.

Do you

know the reason for that?
MR. FEINBERG;

Not only do. I not know the reason

for that, I don't even recall that happening, sir.
QUESTION;

Well, it's very definitely in the

Appendix, and —
MR. FEINBERG;

Judge Fulton is the Chief Judge.

I — my guess would be that he just simply assigned it to
Judge King.

That would just be a guess.

QUESTION:

Well, the statute's pretty specific,

you see.
MR. FEINBERG:

I'm sorry, I cannot illuminate

the Court on that subject.
QUESTION:

Was this heard after Judge Fulton moved

up to West Palm?
MR. FEINBERG:
absolutely sure.

My guess is yes, but I cannot be

That could have been the reason.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything further, Mrs» Shapiro?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

I —

Do you know the answer to the question

Mr. Justice Blackmun asked?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

I'm sorry, I don’t.

All I wanted to emphasise was that Congress has
drawn lots of lines in establishing immigration policy.
The Cuban parolees are — or parolees in general are admitted
on a temporary basis, and they’re not considered to be
permanent — entered to establish permanent residence.
The Medicare provisions, which included this
immigration policy, went into effect in 1966, and these aliens
came in in 1971, on the basis of the policy that was established
in 1966.

So that when they entered, they were — they entered

under the conditions that had — that were in effect -then, in
the Medicare Act as well as in the Immigration Act.
QUESTION;

Mr. Feinberg called this a fundamental

right, that is, the right to have

medical care.

You're —

from what you say, I take it, your response to that would be
that it's a right only as defined by the Congress.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

This is -— certainly it’s a — what's

involved here is subsidized insurance,
QUESTION:

And five-year residency is one of the

37

conditions.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Is one of the conditions under which

these people were admitted? after five years they would be
entitled.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

Because they're getting a

substantial subsidy from the Treasury of the United States„
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

The -- yes» the —

Fifty percent? the fifty percent contri­

bution .
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the basic principle is that

after they have been here for five years, they have mads the
contribution» or that they have been here for long enough
so that it is rational to assume that they have that kind of
a connection, that it's appropriate for them to be entitled
to this insurance.
Thank you very much.
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

QUESTION:

Thank you, —

Mr. Feinberg» I think it's important to

find out the reason for the substitution of Judge King for
Judge Fulton.

Would you ascertain that and let the Court

know by letter?

I certainly will.

And I will inform

the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

And send a copy to Mrs.
