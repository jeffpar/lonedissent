MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first tnis morning in 73-1210, Interstate Commerce Commission
against Oregon Pacific Industries.,
Mr. White, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES H. WHITE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WHITE:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is a direct appeal from final judgment of

a three-judge district court setting aside a Commission's
car service order rendered pursuant to 1(15) of the Interstate
Commerce Act.
Although the case is couched in technical terms,
the. issue before this Court is quite simple.

The issue is

whether the lower court erred in finding that the order of
tiie Commission was a rate order fixed without due process
consideration, or instead, was it an order directed at the
use to which the boxcars

were put?

We submit that Service Order 1134 is a temporary
order aimed at the extended use of the scarce boxcar
resources

as mobile lumber warehouses during a period of

unquestioned transportation

emergency, and as such well

within the reach of 1(15).
This Court is well aware P given the light of the
Allegheny-Ludlum case and Florida East Coast of the chronic

4
boxcar shortage facing the country today.

There is no need

to belabor that point.
However? the order that we are considering here
today arises out of an emergency over and above the chronic
shortage.

In 1972 and early ’73, the country was enjoying

a tremendous economic boom.

Record crops were being harvested

and moved to these country elevators, and a completely
unexpected event happened to create a transportation emergency.
The unprecedented and unexpected Russian grain deal completely
strained and placed an unsustainable strain on the boxcar
fleet.
The Commission moved on many fronts to make sure
that the cars moved in the public interest during this time
of transportation emergency.
QUESTION:
MR, WHITE:

Wasn't that in the summer of 1973?
No? your Honor, this was in the fall

harvest of '72, going into the early spring of '73.

This was

the time of the crisis that hit the Nation.
The Commission orchestrated a series of car service
orders to move the cars expeditiously.

For instance, in

Service Order .1120, it limited the number of jumbo covered
hopper cars that were available to any unit train shipper so
that all grain shippers would have a fair share of this
transportation resource to move the grain.

In 1121 the

Commission was faced with the situation of growing congestion

of tiie ports and a cutback on the free time available to the
shippers of grain.

In 1117, perhaps the most important of

the car service orders in that series, the Commission diverted
coal cars, the open top hopper cars, from the coal industry
to the movement of grain»

And, as pertinent here, the

Commission decided in the face of the emergency that unrestrained?
unlimited reconsignment by the lumber shippers was exacerbating
the transportation emergency and Car Service Order No. 1134
temporarily limited the reconsignment privileges of the
lumber shippers.
Reconsignment, the issue before the Court today, is
markedly different from the transit privileges that this Court
considered in the Wichita case.

Briefly, a transit privilege

allows the shipper to stop his movement for the physical
activity of something like inspecting the grain or creo3oting
lumber and to continue, on with the movement and still enjoy
the benefits of the through rate.
Reconsignment, on the other hand, allows a stopping
in movement simply to change the billing or the destination,
but preserves to the shipper the through rate.
QUESTION:
or what?

And is the stop just an arbitrary place

How does that work?
MR. WHITE:

In the specific instance of lumber

shipping ~~
QUESTION:

They move from west to east.

6

MR. WHITE:

Yes, your Honor.

And there are various

points that have the trackage facilities which the lumber
wholesalers use to stop the cars to let the cars sit out as
luraber warehouses while the market develops.
QUESTION:

What are there, half a dozen or a dozen

places that have these facilities?
MR. MUTE:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, in that order.

There must be physical facilities to set out the strings of
boxcars, and it's on the order of a couple dozen.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE;

These are in the Midwest somewhere?
Primarily in the Midwest, but in the far

West, possibly in Wyoming, in Washington State.

But generally

the movement is, as you correctly put it, from the Northwest
towards the East, and reconcignment points might conceivably
be any place in that quadrant of the country.
that leads to an interesting point.

And in fact

Reconsignment, of its

very nature, must involve some degree of circuity because a
■ft

.

;

Certain percentage of the lumber that is reconsigned is

I' -

reconsigned backwards or perhaps not in the most expeditious
route to the final destination.
The lumber wholesalers are the primary users of the
reconsignment technique.

Lumber is marketed in two ways:

Primarily there are large mills, lumber mills, that have
their own storage capacity and their own sales force.

There

are also small mills which collectively provide the bulk of

7
the lumber that comes eastward»

The small mills typically

have no storage facilities, nor do they have a sales force.
They look to the lumber wholesalers both to market the lumber
and provide the wherewithal for storage.

But the limber

wholesalers themselves have no storage capacity.

They simply

purchase the lumber and immediately cause it to be loaded onto
the boxcars and set the boxcars in motion eastward.

And the

ooxcars are held at the reconsignment point until a market is
made.
The boxcars, while they are at a reconsignmenfc point,
are subject only to the external stimulus of demurrage.

Under

the tariffs that pertain there is no limit to the time that
the boxcars can sit idle.
get the cars moving.

Demurrage is the only incentive to

But in the case of a rising market, in

the case of an inflationary time, the demurrage incentive has
typically been found not to excite fast release of the scarce
boxcars.
QUESTION:

The shippers sometimes U3e the demurrage

as a storage coat, in effect, do they not?
MR. WHITE:

Yes, Hr. Chief Justice, I believe they

do.
QUESTION:

Mr. White, what would the problems have

been had the Commission elected to increase the demurrage
sufficiently to bring about the same result?
HP.. WHITE:

Well, your Honor, if the demurrage was

8

increased sufficiently, as you put it, the exact delimitation
of the storage time would still be uncertain.
you know, is a gradual increase.

Demurrage, as

The overriding need that

the Commission felt was to get the cars back into motion
quickly and within a time period that was reasonably determined
to be five

orking days.

An increase in the demurrage rate

would provide incentive — you are correct in asking the
question — in getting the cars back, but it's not certain
when it would become economically feasible, economically of
sufficient magnitude to get the cars rolling.
The Commission in this case felt a need to get the
cars back in at least five days.

And as the Commission stated

in its service order itself, demurrage hadn't been working in
this particular segment of the economy.

It hadn't been

providing a. sufficient incentive to get the cars back in
motion.
QUESTION?
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

Demurrage goes progressively, doesn't it?
Yes, your Honor, it does.
It’s not so much a day, it's so much —
Well, it can be structured any way the

Commission choosesr I believe.
QUESTION:

But it gets greater per day as the number

of days increase.
MR. WHITE:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

During the emergency period the Commission looked

9

very carefully at the statistics of just what distortions in
the transportation system were being provided by the reconsignment technique.

And it found that by early '73 the supply of

the 40-foot wide-door boxcars was averaging on a daily basis
over 600.

The 50-foot cars were over 2,200 scarce, and of all

boxcars, we were experiencing a scarcity of something on the
order of 13,000 cars.
Meanwhile, the Commission studies showed that the
average hold time

at reconsignment point was 10 days and

nolding experiences of 20 to 30 days were not uncommon.
In this light, the Commission determined that the
emergency was being exacerbated by the reconsignment technique
and issued Car Service Order No. 1134.
In the face of the order itself, the Commission's
rationale was completely outlined.

The Commission found that

the shortage o £ boxcars was impeding the movement of many
commodities, that the cars were being held for excessive periods
at reconsignment points, that the practice v/as immobilizing
cars needed by shippers of other commodities and,perhaps, most
important, that the demurrage technique v/as not a sufficient
incentive to get the cars moving.
So the Commission suspended, as it can under 1(15)(a),
the Car Service Rule which is embodied in open-ended reconsign­
ment.

It limited recon3igximent to five days but did not

eliminate reconsignment.

10

The Commission went one step further and explained
in gratuitous language what the legal effect was of suspending
the car service rule.

It explained the purpose of the car

service order; it explained the result that after the fifth
day, after reconsignment privilege has terminated, the shipper
must bear, as he would anyway, soma of the local rates.

Those

words are not words of rate prescription; they are merely a
description of what the legal effect of the order is.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:

(Inaudible.)
Yes, indeed, it does, your Honor.
Has there been any precedent for this

sort of thing?
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE;

I’m sorry, sir?
Any precedent for this sort of tiling ?
Yes, sir.

There is a case exactly in

point that upholds a car service order of this —
QUESTION:

Well, aren't you in a little bit of a

bind in answering that question of my brother Brennan?

Didn't

you stipulate -~
MR. WHITE:

Yes, I am in a bind, precisely in a bind.

And. I explained candidly in a footnote I did not locate those
car service orders until after the Court had rendered —
QUESTION:

There is a stipulation that there is no

precedent„
MR. WHITE:

There is a stipulation.

11
QUESTI Oil:

And the fact is that there is at least

one or maybe two precedents, right?
Mil. WHITE:
QUESTION:

Yes, indeed, that's the case.
In any event, tne result is that the rate

basis changes on the fifth day.
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.
Well, you charge some of the individual

rates rather than the joint rate, or the through rate.
MR. WHITE:

Mr. Justice White, I would like to try

to answer your question this way:

The Commission suspended,

as it can under 1(15)(a) the car service rule which allows
through rate privileges with reconsignment.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

VJell, that was in the tariff.
That was in the tariff.

The fact that it

was in the tariff does not limit the Commission's ability to
suspend it.

Under 1(15)(a) the Commission is given extremely

broad powers to suspend any and all practices or rules during
a transportation emergency.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

Rates, too?
Yes, your Honor.

This must — the car

service rule must embrace those that are embedded in tariffs.
The Commission did not set rates; it only limited
the use of boxcars as warehouses for five days.

And I submit,

your Honor, that on the face of the statute, on the face of
1(15), it uas the power to do that.

1(15)(a) gives the

12

Commission power in an emergency to suspend any rule, any and
all rules, in effect, with respect to car service.

Car service,

in turn, is defined by 1(10) as to embrace the use to which cars
are put.

Reading 1(10} and 1(15) together the Commission must

have,under 1(15) we submit it does have, the ability to suspend
car service rules embedded in tariffs.
QUESTION:

Can we say that the other side of Hr.

Justice White's question is that if the car moves within the
designated time, the rate isn't changed at all?
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION;
MR. WHITE:
the shipper.

Precisely that, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
It depends on how we look at it.
Exactly that.

The option is left with

As long as the shipper seeks only transportation

and reasonable reconsignment, there is absolutely no change in
the rate he must pay.

And, in effect, Car Service Order No.

1134.reached precisely that goal.
was driven down to five days.

The average detention time

There has been very — I have

not. received any information that there has been much, if any,
additional charges paid.

The average hold time was brought

down within the reach of the car service order, and the cars
moved in the public interest during the crisis.

The order

worked.
QUESTION:
its order

Mr. White, before the Commission entered

that's on appeal here, supposing that you put

lumber in a boxcar in Portland and consigned it to Chicago

13

and tlien exercised your reconsignment privilege of the shipper
to say it goes back to Denver", and it's ultimately sold in
Denver.

Nov?, what rate would that shipper pay?
MR. WHITE:

The shipper would pay, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, the through rate from Portland to Denver.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

You mean he could ship —
Even with that built-in circuity that I

alluded to earlier, that the circuity is a part of the practice
that is necessary if reconsignment is fully applied.
QUESTION:

Even if it ended up, it went back to

Seattle, he would pay only from Portland to Seattle?
MR. WHITE:

I believe that's right, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
And that leads me to a point that this Court touched
upon way back in the Turner Lumber case that reconsignment
privileges are,during times of economic crisis, anyway,
inherently wasteful of transportation resources.

They have

been tolerated by the Commission; they haven't been formally
promulgated in any way.

The tariff provisions providing for

reconsignment have been merely tolerated.

And during times of

unquestioned crisis, transportation crisis, the likes of which
we experienced during the Russian grain deal, that practice
has not been and should not be tolerated when weighed against
the overriding public need to keep the cars moving for all
commodities.

14
That leads me to another point, Mr, Justice Rohnquist.
My brother is concerned that Car Service Order 1134 eliminates
the reconsignment practice»

It does not.

It, during its

duration, during the crisis, limited the practice to five working
days.

It did not eliminate reconsignnent.

And because it

did not eliminate reconsignment as a marketing technique, I
submit that the mechanism in 1134, mechanism for adjusting the
needs of a particular segment of the economy, vis-a-vis the
overall economy, must be preserved to the Commission.

1134,

I submit, is a careful accommodation of the public interest
and the interest of a segment of the economy.
The Court did not throw out the particular accommoda­
tion.

The Court, instead, threw out the whole mechanism.
QUESTION:

Mr. White, let me theorize a little bit.

If the ICC didn't have this emergency power, do you think it
would have by this time have devised some solution to this
longstanding, chronic problem?
MR. WHITE:
do you mean?

Mr, Justice Blackmun, which chronic problem

The car shortage or the reconsignment?

QUESTION:

The car shortage.

It seems always to be

with us and never can get solved.
MR. WHITE:

I can report that the Commission has

taken a very significant and important step just this week,
I relieve, in Ex parte 241.

This Court had the earlier phase

of 241, the A1legheny-Ludlum case.

The Commission is exercising

15

its authority which it firmly believes it has to order the
nation's carriers to augment their boxcar fleet.

There is a

motion to show cause* a show-cause order outstanding today
ordering the nation's railroads to restore their boxcar fleets
to the standards that pertained in the 1970 to 1972 period.
QUESTIONS

The financing of that, I gather, is public

(inaudible).
MR. WHITE:

The financing is a mixed problem because

some of the nation's railroads, as you know, Mr. Justice
Brennan, are in deep financial trouble, but others are not.
QUESTION:

This applies uniformly?

MR. WHITE:

This applies uniformly and it is aimed

at increasing the fleet by some 69,000 units, and reducing the
bat order ratio.

So the Commission is taking forceful steps.

And Congress is taking forceful steps.

There is

legislation pending right now, Senate 1X49, looking towards
financial aid from Congress and looking ultimately towards the
creation of a national boxcar fleet if financial aid doesn't
work.

So vary important strides are being made.
But I think we can predict with some certainty that

it will take time.

And during the time it takes, there will

be, we can state with certainty, continuations or periodic
reoccurrences of transportation emergency, and because we can
safely predict that transportation emergencies will be in our
future, the Commission needs to have a full array of remedial

16

tools to cope "with emergencies as they come over the horizon.
That means it must have a full array of demurrage techniques,
it must hcive a full array of free-time limitation techniques,
and it must in this particular instance preserve the technique

before us, have we not?
MR. WHITE:

Yes, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice.

other factors.
MR. WHITE:

No, I respectfully would not call them

all emergency situations.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

You have had —

It was a car shortage problem.
Chronic shortage problems.

what I am here talking about today, your Honor.

That is not
We are talking

about a very unusual emergency existing on top of the chronic
shortage.
QUESTION:

There is nothing unique about the car

shortage problem in this country from time to time, is there?
MR. WHITE:

No.

We are in a period of chronic

shortage.
QUESTION:

Sometimes we have the cars, but we have

them in places where they aren't needed.
MR. WHITE:

Indeed we do, and that's one of the

reasons why we have to have, the Commission has to have the
ability to order the cars to be moved to where we need them
tne most.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. White, tlie statute, of course,

18

confers this power only to shortage of equipment or other
emergency *

wow, you have just said that this is a chronic

condition.
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

No, your Honor.
Is it chronic?
I am trying to find, if I may — what I

am talking about here is a series of car service orders and a
car service order that was aimed at an emergency.
QUESTION:

It's a never-ending emergency, though,

isn't it?
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION;

No, indeed, I don't believe it is.
I understood your answer to be that there

has been a chronic shortage for some time, but that this was
an extraordinary emergency.
MR. WHITE:

This was an emergency on top of the

chronic shortage, an emergency that triggered the extraordinary
summary powers

the Commission has.

QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

That, being the grain deal?
The grain deal was one segment of it,

as I mentioned.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

That1s over.

That's over.

Yes, indeed.
Now what's left in the way of an emergency?
I don't believe that the emergency that

supported 1134 3till exists.

And that's totally consistent

19
with —
QUESTION:

That's what I wanted to know.

Then, if

you prevail here, what happens to 1134?
MR. WHITE;

If we prevail, 1134 wight — 1134 still

is in existence, but it has been suspended by the court.
QUESTION;

I know that, but if you prevail, what

happens ?

MR. Ml ITS:

If we prevail —

QUESTION;

Is it reinstated?

MR. WHITE:

If we prevail, 1134 probably ’would be

terminated because of the end of the emergency.
Wo are not here for that simple reason.

We are here

to preserve a technique, a remedy, an adjustment mechanism that
might be used in the future and -that must be available to the
Commission in the future.
QUESTION:

You don't think there is something like

mootness about this thing?
MR. WHITE:

Indeed, I don't, Mr. Justice Brennan.

The Court recently looked at the mootness issue in the
befunis case.

One of the exceptions to Defunis, as the Court

pointed out, was the Southern Pacific Terminal case versus ICC,
which in precisely the same kind of order we have here, in
the sense that there were recurring short-term orders that
could be mooted out, so to speak, that could be noneffective
by the time the courts got the mechanism into reviewing them,.

20

We precisely have the

same situation here.

We can predict

future emergencies and we can predict the repetition of the
same kind of question before the Court, and we respectfully
submit that this is, indeed, if there ever was a situation
where the exception to Defunis applies, that here we might have
an issue capable of repetition, yet evading judicial review.
QUESTION;

Mr. White, following through a little on

this, didn't 1134 by its terms have an expiration date?

believe the first time around, and it was: renewed.

And this

is precisely the — it's a mechanism that is necessary in an
emergency situation.

At the expiration of the duration of the

car service order, the Commission is compelled to again look
at the situation to determine if the emergency still exists.
If it doesn't still exist, the car service order terminates.
QUESTION;

If you prevail here, does it go automatically

back into effect at this late date?
ME. WHITE;

Yes, it goes into effect, but the Commission

will be compelled to consider the underlying economics to see
if indeed the emergency still persists.

And if it does not

persist, Car Service Order 1134 v/ill have been terminated and

21
will no longer apply.
QUESTION;

If I follow that/ if you prevail here,

even though there has been no extension to November 20, 1974,
it's your position that it will automatically go back into
effect?
MR. WHITE;

The Commission has, from time to time,

extended the car service order, but it had no application.
extended it for this reason, Mr. Justice Blackmun:

It

During

this period the Commission has been very carefully building
a record of statistics.

If we are successful today and Car

Service Order 1134 is reinstated, it will have the body of
information upon which it can make a judgment whether the
emergency still exists and more likely than not will determine
that it does not exist and the car service order will be
terminated.
QUESTION:

Is there somewhere in the record, Mr.

White, something other than the notations at page 17 of the
appendix which indicate that the original expiration date was
July 31, 1973,

some indication that the Commission has renewed

it?
MR. WHITE:

Yes, indeed.

It has been renewed on

that date., and it has been renewed a second time.

But, of

course, it was held void abinitio by the cwart, so it had no
effect other than the Commission has been gathering data
all during this period and obviously \tfill take it upon itself

22

to re-examine the underlying premises of the car service order
at the termination of judicial review.
QUESTION:

Well, did the Commission extend the order,

enter subsequent orders extending the order?

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why the Commission

couldn’t have sought a stay from this Court after the threejudge district court set its order aside?
MR. WHITE:

Ho, your Honor, there is no reason

why it could not have.
QUESTION:

Mr. White, it is evident from what you

said that the car shortage problem is chronic, although you
suggest that this particular order was triggered by the
Soviet wheat deal.

Let's assume it is severely chronic and

that this practice of affording what in effect you characterise
as storage facilities has to be eliminated or modified on a
long-term basis, not just an order for 60 or 90 days.
Under what section of the Act would the Commission, and what
would it proceed to do?
MR. WHITE:

I suspect the Commission would undertake

a rule-making procedure, probably under section 15(7) that
basically allows the Commission to examine the rate structure.
It would be a rule-making proceeding with full notice and
full participation by the parties, something in line with the

24

proceeding, perhaps in Ex parte 241, perhaps even a subnumbered proceeding in that case, the case, of course, that
was reviewed here in Allegheny-Ludlum.

The Commission would

provide full due process protection in any kind of an overhaul
or long-term change in the marketing practice..

In my judgment,

it would probably be something akin to Ex parte 241,
investigation of boxcar adequacy.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. White.

Mr. Coblens.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEYMOUR L. COBLENS
ON BEHALF OF TIIE APPELLEES
MR. COBLENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the

Court, may it please the Court:

In answer, since I do not

get any rebuttal, I would like to answer some of the questions
of

my friend.
In answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, I

believe, and possibly there was a misunderstanding, as far as
I know, there is no judicial precedent upholding an order of
this kind.

There is an order that the Commission couldn't

even find and nobody else could until they dredged it up,
which they claim to be a precedent.
QUESTION:

That is number one.

Doesn't it make any difference if in

fact it is there and overlooked?
MR. COBLENS:

No, it doesn’t make any difference,

your Honor, except the fact that I didn't want there to be

25

any misunderstanding that there was a judicial precedent upholding an order of this kind, and I don't think that there has
been a judicial precedent.

As far as I know, this is the first

case of this kind, and insofar as I know, as far as the industry
is concerned, this matter is something that the industry, as
such, was not aware of, at least not recently.
Now, with respect to the question of Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, a statement was made that if it went from Portland
to Denver and back to Seattle, that there would be no charge.
It is my understanding that is not a correct statement of the
fact.

I have been informed that there is no way in which you

can backhaul a car.

It has to move forward from west to east.

If you move it backwards, then it becomes an entirely new rate.
This is the information I have received, and I respectfully —
I believe rny brother is in error when he made that statement.
Now, with respect to Order No. 1134, it is still in
existence, and as my brother has 3tated, it is in full force
and effect.

It can be activated by the Commission at any time

and it's solely in the discretion of the Commission whether
it is made effective.

So that

QUESTION:

But dependent on the finding of emergency.

MR. COBLEMS:

Dependent on the finding of emergency.

But as of the moment, it is it not —
QUESTION:

Completely stayed, isn't it?

MR. COBLENS:

I beg your pardon, no, it is not stayed,

26

sir.
QUESTION:

What did the district court do?

MR. COBLEHS:

Oh, I beg your pardon.

The district

court stayed the effectiveness of the order.

It declared it

null and void, not by reason of emergency, but by reason of
the fact that it was an illegal rating.
QUESTION:

So it is not in effect.

MR. COBLENS:

It’s not in effect insofar as becoming

effective as far as the rates are concerned.

But the district

court made no finding with respect to emergency because of
certain precedents.
QUESTION:

Do you agree that the Commission has gone

through the procedure of extending the order —
MR. COBLENS:

Yes, sir, this is true.

This is true.

I have seen the —
QUESTION:

And each time asserting an emergency?

MR. COBLENS:

Each time, as far as I recall, asserting

an emergency.
Now, this Court can affirm the judgment of the court
below on one of two grounds:

The first is to follow the reason­

ing of the district couarfc and hold that Service Order No. 1134
did not constitute a car service order as authorised by 49 U.S.C.
115 and was invalid because, as the court stated, it was an
illegal rate-fixing
due process.

order developed through procedures lacking

27
Mow, let me stata parenthetically, nobody before this
Court argues that the Interstate Commerce Commission does not
have the power, assuming that it uses due process, to do what
it desires, assuming that it gives due hearing with respect to
reconversion.

I think my brother admitted that, if it uses

section 15, 49 U.S.C. 115, it can issue a new tariff or apply
a new tariff.

But in that case, of course, we would have to

have a hearing, the industry input would have to be there, and
you would not have bangol without us knowing anything about it.
The industry would have an opportunity to have something to
say.
At this point there is no opportunity whatsoever.

The

order is issued before we even know about it, and sometimes it
becomes effective before the industry knows anything about it.
So there is no question about the power of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, assuming that it provides
ordinary due process, which section 1(15) does not provide.
And this is what this case is all about, as I indicated in my
brief.
QUESTION:

Coxild you give a hypothesis as to how

long that due process might take, the kind of due process you
are talking about?
MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

Well, the Court well knows

Not that we measure due process by time.

But when we are confronted with an emergency, that does enter

28
into it, doesn’t it?
ME. COB LENS:

But, your Honor, we have had emergencies

for 75 years and this business of reconsignraent has been in
existence for 50 years, and as my brother states, we can expect
further emergencies from time to time.

So that when you are

talking in terms of possibly a year, as against 50 years or
75 years, it seems to me that if this Court, which balances
the interests, and this is the balance wheel of the nation,
that even assuming it takes a year to give due process, which
it might very well, the element of due process, which the Court
v/ell knows is so important, is worth it, particularly when we
know that for years and years and years, unless something was
done, we are going to have some emergency or another.

If it's

not the Russian grain deal, it will be the Patagonian wheat
deal, or it will be some other deal that will come in and —
because the basic fact is that there are just not enough car3,
and v/hen you don't have enough cars, the slightest dislocation
causes a •‘emergency1’ on the basis of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coblens, in that connection, suppose

the Commission issued an order just stating that no car could
be held more than five days at the reconsignment point.

Valid

without a hearing?
MR. COBLENS:

Yes, sir, they filed it without a hearing

under 1(15), if they found an emergency.

29

QUESTION:

So that they could go that far.

MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

...

That is correct.
order, and you would have no

objection.
MR. COBLENS:

I raise an objection.

If we had no —

to the extent possible, I would try to prevent it.

My basic

plea is, number one, the court below held that this was a
rate order and, consequently, they set it aside as a rate
?

order.

In addition to that, as I would like to propose, or we

argue, the fact that tliis Court noted probable jurisdiction
and did not merely affirm on the basis of the opinion, indicates
that the court is interested in the broader aspects of the
case than the points made by the court below.

The court

below went on a perfectly sound and legal ground, namely, that
it was a rate order and section 1(15) did not provide for
changes in rates.
But there is underlying the whole case, and something
I would like to get across to the Court, a more fundamental
question, a question which this Court peculiarly is designed
to take care of, and that question is this:

Must this Court

or any court accept the ipse dixit of the Interstate Commerce
Commission in spite of all the evidence to the contrary that
the freight oar situation on the nation's railroads is a
temporary emergency which should be dealt with under the
provisions of 49 USC 1(15) rather than a long, continuing

30

and probably continuing problem?

And as the Court we.13. knows,

this is what we have.
Section 49 USC 1(14), which is the general rulemaking power, provides full due process procedures, and
section 49 USC

15 . which is the through and joint rate

provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, provides an orderly
means of dealing with the problem, giving all interested
parties full due process rights.
The broader issue before this Court, and it can only
be made before this Court, is whether this Court will sanction
the abrogation of the doctrine of judicial supremacy which I
have been taught and have taught others to believe is one of
the principal doctrines of American constitutional law.
QUESTION:

As I understand your friend’s argument on

this matter of a chronic condition related to an emergency is
perhaps vaguely analogous to a person who has diabetes which is
chronic that goes into diabetic shock, perhaps from time to
time, and perhaps he analogizes this immediate situation as a
diabetic shock.

He calls for something other than ordinary

treatment.
MR. COBLENS:

Except the fact that I forget now hew

many diabetic shocks the lumber industry has had in this
regard.

Orders of various kinds have been issued against the

lumber industry by reason of one "emergency" after another.
Now, how many emergencies make an emergency?

This is what you

31
are up against.

How many emergencies do you have to have

before you have a chronic situation?

And it's my contention,

your Honor, that when you have an emergency that existed for
50 years or thereabouts, it's not an emergency any more; it's
something that should be dealt with, giving the input of the
industry under either section 1(14) or section 15, which
allows due process rights.
QUESTION:

This isn't the basis the district court

went on.
MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

This is not the basis of the —

The district court said that even if it's

an emergency, and they seemed to accept the fact that it was,
it isn’t a car service order.
MR. COBLENS:

before the district court,for a perfectly good reason.

There

QUESTION:

MR. COBLENS:

I attacked the order.

Did you say it wasn’t an emergency?

32

MR. COBLENS;

I did not bring that point before the

court because the court had already ruled against me on that
question, and I will confess it.
QUESTION:

What you are really arguing now is that

even if the district court was i^rong in calling it a rate order
MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

That's right.

That it is a car service order, and you

say, nevertheless, you are entitled to an affirmance because
it is no emergency.
MR. COBLENS:

That's correct, sir, and that this Court

as —
QUESTION:

What do we have before us on which we can

judge whether there is or isn't —
MR. COBLENS:

The history and the cases that Justice

Rehnquist wrote and I cited in my brief.
QUESTION:

Are we going to be fact-finders on that?

MR. COBLENS:

I don't think it's a fact-finding.

I

think this Court has already held that there is a chronic car
shortage.

Justice Rehnquist has held that.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, are you supporting the

district court* s conclusion?
MR. COBLENS:

I am supporting the district court's

conclusion.
QUESTION:

And for the reason that it used?

MR. COBLENS:

That’s right.

33
QUESTION:

That it is net a car service order.

MR. COBLEWS:

That is correct, sir.

I say that I

have two strings to my bow.
QUESTION:

Tell me again why it isn’t a car service

order, but a rate order.
MR. COBLENS:

Because of the fact that it affects

the rates, the traditional and historic way in which car service
orders have been enforced.

And except for the two orders that

I didn’t know about and the ICC didn’t know about, the traditional
way is by use of demurrage charges, and as has been stated —
QUESTION:

Which increases the costs to the shipper.

MR. COBLENS:

It. increases the cost to the shipper.

Everything increases the cost to the shipper, or to the
ultimate buyer in an economic sense.
QUESTION:

Unfortunately, yes.

QUESTION:

It increases the cost --- this has been

pointed out —- only to the extent the purpose of the order is
not achieved.

The purpose of the order is to free up freight

cars, and to the extent it does, to the extent it prevents
freight cars being used in this way longer than five days,
then it doesn't increase the cost at all.
MR. COBLENS:

But the difficulty with that is that

this is what the Interstate Commerce Commission has stated.
As I point out in my record and in the affidavit before the
court below, there are many economic arguments for reconversion

34

and for the practices of the lumber industry, and the lumber
industry or the wholesale lumber industry has never had an
opportunity to submit those arguments because never has the
Interstate Commerce Commission taken this question up in a
full due process hearing.
QUESTION:

But if this were just a demurrage, in short,

putting a uniform charge, daily charge, or something like that,
for holding a car too long, you probably wouldn't be here.
MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

I would not be here —

This puts a very different charge on

different shippers.
MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Depending on what the rate structure —

so the extra charge is dependent upon a rate rather than a
demurrage, some uniform charge.

QUESTION:

MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

It doesn't triple it if the car moves.

MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

That is true, sir.

That is true.

This Court has upheld the demurrage charges

against challenge, and I guess what I want, and I think what

35
Mr. Justice White wants is what’s the difference?
MR. C03LENS:

The difference is in the structure of

the Interstate Commerce Act.

The Interstate Commerce Act

only gives authority to the Interstate Commerce Commission
for emergency action in the case of rules under 1(15).

Justice

Brandeis in the Pekin case, which I have cited, has stated
that 1(15) must be very strictly construed and that it is
only traditional and at that time it was traditional only to
enforce rules by various — either by prohibition,

criminal

prohibition or by in some cases demurrage charges.*
Nov/, if we follow Justice Brandeis' reasoning, that
this is in effect a quasi-criminal statute, and since the
Interstate Commerce Act in this particular section, because
of the very emergency factor involved, and because of the fact
that it does away with due process, must be strictly construed.
Therefore, the court below held that since it is such an
unusual remedy and since section 1(15) does not give that
remedy, it does not come under the terms of section 1(15),
and that’s the difference, because of the fact that in one
case due process is granted, and in the other case it is not.
The Commission has had authority under section 49 USC
to deal with this problem for 50 years.
QUESTION:

'15/

;

Can’t you say exactly the same, thing

about demurrage charges, exactly the same thing?

And, further,

I thought a little while ago you had conceded that if the

3G
Commission put out a plain, bar order and said no car may be
held more than five days., this would be all right without
due process,
MR. COBLENS:

If I said so, I misspoke myself, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t say it was a rate order,

would you?
MR. COD LENSNo, sir,,
QUESTION:

I would say that —

It would have the same effect, wouldn't it?

MR. COBIENS:

It might have.

Yes, it would have the

same effect in. the sense that it would put criminal penalties
presumably on it, some penalties of some kind,
QUESTION:

But it wouldn’t be a rats — unless the

Commission 3a.id that the line haul rates would apply, the
individual rates would apply, then the individual rates
wouldn't apply just with a bar order?

Hare they want on and

said, the individual ratas will apply, not the through rates.
MR, COBLENS:

That is correct, sir.

I don’t know

exactly — I can’t guess what penalty the Interstate
Commereo Commission,in some cases they impose fines, in some
cases they have imposed jail .sentences, made it a violation of
the Interstate Commerce Act —
QUESTION:

And in other cases when they say no mere

than, five days, they put a demurrage charge.
MR. COBLENS:

They put a demurrage charge on it.

37
That is true, sir.
QUESTION;

2\nd my contention here —
I think it is conceivable that a demurrage

charge could be the equivalent of the increased rate, couldn’t
it?

In dollars?
MR. COBLSNS:
QUESTION;

Except the fact that —

No, couldn’t it be?

I mean, suppose it

were $100 a day demurrage charge.
MR. COBLENS:

No, it might not be.

$10,000 a day, I assume so.

Oh, if it’s

But you get to a point at which

a demurrage charge becomes more than, something different
than a demurrage charge.
QUESTION;

Here if they hold it one day too long

it could cost, in one of these examples, $1500.
MR. COBLENS;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, sir.

That's correct.

For 7500 pounds.

MR. COBLENS:

That’s correct.

So that you come

down to a question, I suppose a question of degree in the
sense that when — a demurrage charge usually

starts at

$10 a day and it may go to $20, $25, $50 or what have you.
That has been the traditional way in which it’s done.
If after five days they put a demurrage charge of
$1500 a day, which I suppose is something the Commission —QUESTION:

Well, a demurrage charge has to be uniform.

The way this rate thing works, I gather some shippers pay,
according to these examples, a thousand dollars more, others

30

$300 more, others $600 more.
MR. COBLEI3S:
it finally winds up.

That is correct, depending upon where
A demurrage charge would be uniform,

but say, it rvas $1500 a day, my contention then would be, and
I think it would be justified, that this isn't true demurrage,
this is in effect a change of quality rather than purely
quantity.

At some point a change in quantity becomes a change

in quality, and my contention is that based upon the way in
which this order was designed and is designed, and talking
specifically with 1134, it's a rate order, it's designed to
affect the rate at which commodities move.

Rates at 'which

commodities move on a through and joint rate are governed by
section 49 USC
rights.

15 .

Section 49 USC

15

provides due process

Section 1<15), which is the one under which 1134,
t

all it requires under its wording is that "The Commission is
of the opinion that an emergency is required."

And the worst

part about that is that several courts of this country have
held — and I've cited them — the Daugherty case and the two
Southern Railway

cases — have held that we as a court cannot

go into the question of whether the opinion of the Interstate
Commerce Commission is or is not justified.

All we can do is

to decide whether or not the Interstate Commerce Commission is
corrupt or arbitrary or some other tiling.
QUESTION:

It is because of those cases that you

didn't make your lack of emergency

argument in the district

3.9

court.
MR. COBLENS:
exactly so.

That is correct, sir.

That is

And the reason I didn’t make it in ray case, in

my court, is because ray court, the U.S. District Court for
the District of Oregon, had decided the Daugherty

for ms to go before a court which had ruled adversely to rae

of the Interstate Commerce Act, except for section X (15) ,

I don’ t know,

your Honor, and I have never really'thought the question
through whether or not an Interstate Commerce Act, which did
not provide for due process in all these other cases, would
be struck down by this Court.

This Court has never been faced

with that problem because the history of the Interstate
Commerce Act has been that,if anything, the Interstate Commerce
Commission has been overly cautious in all cases except, under
1(15), and it's this exception of 49 USC 1(15) that I am
here complaining about, particularly as used in this case.
Does that answer the first question?

QUESTION:

Yes, in this case you are making a

statutory argument.
MR. COBLENS:

I am making a statutory argument, but

I think that if in all other cases, if the other provisions
of the Interstate Commerce Act did not provide due process,
I think certainly counsel, other counsel, would have been here
long before me arguing the constitutional question, and I would
not be here,possibly» arguing the constitutional question.
Nov/, I feel that before this Court, this question is
not an emergency.

How long do you have a situation which has

existed admittedly for 50 years and which we know is going to

41
exist for another 50 years unless a complete change is made,
how can the Interstate Commerce Commission claim that it's
an emergency?

An emergency, as I understand it, based upon

the dictionary definition, is a sudden, total, and unexpected
event.
QUESTION:

Well, the Commission here apparently

suggests to you that if the district court is reversed on the
car service as against rate order, then the Commission is
going to — you are going to have some chance to litigate
before the Commission again with respect to an emergency —
MR. COBLENS:
QUESTION:

We never did have a chance to litigate.

I know, but they still have to decide

each time whether there is an emergency.
