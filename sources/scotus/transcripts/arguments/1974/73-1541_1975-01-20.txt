PROCEEDINGS
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

VJe will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1541, Reid against Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
Mr. Globman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN GLOBMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GLOBMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
Mr. and Mrs. Reid, who are Petitioners in this
specific case, are natives of British Honduras.
•

i

They are

citizens of British Honduras.
Both of them entered the United States through a
port of entry at Chula Vista, California.

They each, in

individual cases, presented themselves before the immigration
authorities, inspectors, and announced themselves as U. S.
citizens.
They were admitted and entered the United States
and took up their life here in the United States.
Subsequent to their entry, they became parents of
two American-born children, citizens of the United States.
QUESTION:

Did they ever report to the Immigration

Service their true status, from the time they entered until
the time this litigation arose?

4
MR. GLOBMAN:

Litigation arose by a voluntary

action upon the part of the Reids.

They presented themselves

to the Immigration Service at Hartford, Connecticut,
voluntarily.
QUESTION:

After they had the two children?

MR. GLOBMAN:

Yes.

Yes* after they had the two

children they presented themselves in Hartford before the
Service and since that date they have filed their annual
report.
Now,, they presented themselves, submitted to the
authority of the Service and were placed on charges.
They were charged with having entered under false
claim of citizenship and without inspection.
QUESTION:

They —

Do you remember the date when that

was done ?
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe that goes back —

Three or four years

three or four

years after their entry?
MR. GLOBMAN:
entry.

No, about two years after their

Mr. Reid entered in 1968 in November and Mrs. Reid

entered in ’69, either January or February and after the
birth of the first child and while Mrs. Reid was pregnant,
they reported to the Service.
The hearing before the

SIO, the Special Inquiry

Officer, I believe was held in 1970 or *71.
QUESTION:

Does the record show either why they

5
happened to come In at Chula Vista or how.they ended up in
Connecticut?
MR. GLOBMAN:

The record does not show.

In any event, the Reids went through the entire
hearing process before the Immigration Service.

At their

hearing, deportation hearings they requested termination of
proceedings based upon Section 24l (P) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act.
Now, this section has been adjudicated by this
Court in the Errico case.
Now, at the hearing, they were denied this termin­
ation of proceedings based upon the Attorney General’s
decision in the Lee case.
This decision of the Special Inquiry Officer x*ho
entered an order of voluntary departure and an ultimate order
of deportation was appealed to the Board of Immigration
Appeals and the Board of Immigration Appeals once again, on
the basis of the Lee case, denied the appeal and entered the
same order as the

Special Inquiry Officer.

Then this case came before the Second Circuit in
New York and we are presently here on the matter today.
Now, in the record, it is spelt out that both
Mr. and Mrs. Reid have never been arrested, have never been a
member of any subversive organization or communist organization
and that they have — I might say for the benefit of the

6
Court; that ever since their entry into the United States,
they have been gainfully employed and have always supported
each other and their children, have never been upon the
welfare rolls of any agency of government nor any private
agency.
QUESTION:

What have they been employed In, what

kind of occupation?
MR. GLOBMAN:

They are working in factories,

bench hands, machine hands and they have been gainfully
employed at all — throughout the period.
QUESTION:

How long have they been in Hartford?

Have the been in Hartford the whole time?
MR. GLOBMAN:

They are in Danbury, Connecticut,

They have been there since very shortly after their entry,
QUESTION:

Because they entered -—

MR. GLOBMAN:

They entered at Chula Vista,

Southern California.
QUESTION:

— through California from Mexico,

did they not?
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And does the record show what brought

them up to New England?
MR. GLOBMAN:

The record does not show.

But they

have had friends in the area and after they entered, they
decided that they would make their life in the Connecticut

7
area where they had friends.
QUESTION:

Exactly what was the fraud?

MR. GLOBMAN:

That they were — claimed to be U.S.

citizens when, in fact, they were not U.S. citizens and on
the basis of their claim, they were admitted.
QUESTION:

They claimed that to the Immigration

authorities?
MR. GLOBMAN:

Yes, they presented themselves to the

U.S. Immigration authorities at Chula Vista and announced
themselves as U.S. citizens and were then admitted.
QUESTION:

I suppose there Is no official contem­

poraneous record of that, is there, because that would have
just been an oral representation.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, oral representation,

So what we have is their statement that

that is how they got in.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Is that it?

MR. GLOBMAN':

That is correct but this has been

found in the record by the Special Inquiry Officer that they
were —
QUESTION:

That that is, in fact, how they —

MR. GLOBMAN:

That is correct, yes,

QUESTION:

— entered the United States,

QUESTION:

Mow, if they had disclosed at that time

that they were citizens, British citizens of Honduras, then
what would have happened to them at the time?
MR. GLOBMAN:
been admitted.

Then they probably would not have

They would have been sent back to go through

the allocation route.
QUESTION:

They’d have to go back to the consul

and —
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

In Honduras and try to get a visa.

MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

To the U. S. Consul in Honduras.

That is correct.

They would have to show that they

either had employment assured here or that they had means of
support here and a great many other things would have to
be demonstrated, would they not?
MR. GLOBMAN:

Yes.

Let me say for the record that

they probably could never have entered the United States if
we are talking about coming by means of a labor certification,
vrhich means that they had obtained a certificate from the
Labor Department saying that they were needed in the American
economy because there were no other laborers available to
fill the specific job for which an employer had sought them.
They would never have entered the United States because the
quota was backed up for years.
So had they had a. labor certification, they could
not have obtained a visa at that time.

9
Now they are here, having gone through the entire
procedure and we are confronted this morning with their right
to remain here under the statute.
This Court has faced this particular section of the
statute, Section 2*11 (P) in the Errieo case and made its
pronouncements in that specific area.
The Government here this morning says that the
judgment of the Court should be

confined strictly only to

quota discussion on the Section.
Their claim is that the Reids are not entitled to
the 241(F) exception or exemption from deportation because
they failed to submit to inspection.
They say that this is not an inspection and they
say also that — they claim because they did not have a visa.
The Government says that there are two requirements,
the
that, first of all, that there be a visa in/possession of
the intending entrant and secondly, that in presenting this
visa at the pox-fc of entry, he announce himself as an alien
and then be put through the examination procedure, whatever
it might be at that time.
Now, the examination at the port of entry can be
either rigid or

be perfunctory.

If a person comes in with

a visa, regardless of whether this visa was obtained legally
and without fraud and submits himself at the port of entry
to an immigration officer, the immigration officer can do one

10

of two things.

He can merely take the man’s passport, open

it up to the visa page, see that it is stamped and feeling
assured in his own mind that this is a genuine visa, that it
is not a forgery or a phoney, admit him and this would be
the entire Inspection procedure at the port of entry.
Or he can go the entire gamut and, once again,
take out the papers, go through it question by

question,

where were you born, produce the birth certificate to show
it and the status of your health.
If he wanted to at that time, he could require him
to have a new physical examination.

He could require that

any documents which he might have in his possession showing
that he would not become a public charge be updated and do
any one of these things that the consul

has already done

prior to his arriving at the port of entry.
For the most part, however, examinations at the
port of entry are strictly perfunctory.

The Immigration

officer opens the passport, sees the visa stamped in the
passport and if he feels assured that this is a genuine
passport, this is about the sum of it.

He takes his papers

and that is the answer.
Now, we claim here that any person coming into the
United States under claim of U. S.

citizenship and meeting

the.other requirements being otherxfise admissible and having,
in this specific case, U.S. children, is —

11
QUESTION:

How were the Petitioners otherwise

admissible for purposes of the statute?
MR. GL03MAN:
QUESTION:

In the record —

You told us earlier that they could not

possibly have qualified for visas, even if they had had
laborers certificates.
MR. GLOBMAN:

Only on the laborer certification,

that they would have had to wait for a visa until sometime
late In the future.
But at the factual situation at the time of their
entry, the quota fixed preference, they had to come in under
the subquota of Great Britain and there are only 200 visas
Issued annually under the subquota.
They would be in the
labor certification.

6th preference had they had a

This would be their only disqualifi­

cation, if you want to call it that, that they didn't have a
labor certification.
QUESTION:

But the requirement of the section is,

they must not alone have children, but also be otherwise
admissible.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, qualitatively.

Now, tell me again how they were other­

wise admissible at the time of entry.
MR. GLOBMAN:
no moral question.

Yes.

Yes.

First of all, there was

The SIO, the Special Inquiry Officer,

12
found that they had the moral qualifications, they had the
physical qualifications.

They were not members of any sub­

versive organisations no criminal record and were therefore,
under 212(A), admissible.
QUESTION:

Notwithstanding the backed-up quota.

MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Quota, yes.

And that is the Errico case, isn't it?

I mean, that —
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

They were on the same track in the

Errico case.
MR. GLOBMAN:

Under quantitative admissibility,

yes.
QUESTION:

And there was a dissenting opinion

that was —- well, it was a dissenting opinion that said that
otherwise admissible meant more than —meant more than what
the Court decided their —
MR. GLOBMAN:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Are the two cases parallel in terms of

the quota aspects?
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

They are parallel, yes.

Parallel or the same or —

MR. GLOBMAN:

They are the same, the same because

of the actual xact of the quota

at the time and as a matter

13
of fact, the quota today is still backed up in British
Honduras.
QUESTION:

Well, you had indicated in your earlier

response that for all practical purposes, they should never
have been admitted to the United States, except for the fraud.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, based on the quota.

Mr. Globman, I'd like to ask you a

question about the statute which I guess is set forth at
page 2 of the Government's brief and It is probably set forth
in your brief, too.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

When you get down to the language, "An

alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who is the
spouse, parent or a child of a United States citizen or of
an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence."
:- v .A

-ivv-

isn't at least a permissible con­

struction of that statute that at the time of entry you have
‘

i

to have been the parent or the spouse?
MR. GLOBMAN:

No, I don't believe that is so at all.

I think the statute --- the enactment to the statute was
basically for the purpose of correcting situations that had
already taken place,
QUESTION:

That the man gets in and then it subjects

him —
MR. GLOBMAN:

Yes, that is correct, that the purpose

Ik
of this statute was to protect certain small groups of
individuals itfho found their way into the United States and
that the statute comes into effect long after the breach
has been committed, the violation has been committed.
It is a remedial statute and it was introduced
to soften the harsh provisions of the statute.

This is

not —
QUESTION:

But* of course, if your construction

that you urge in this case is right, isn’t it pretty much
just an open door policy if you can just get through in some
way and you have a child that you are okay?
MR. GLOBMAN:

Only, your Honor, if the entry,

actual entry, is gained by fraud.

The statute says, procure

entry by fraud.
It gives many and they are all In the

It is disjunctive,

meaning, giving individuals in each of these categories the
protection of the law.
QUESTION:

But, presumably, those are the only

ones who need relief; the ones who get in here lawfully
don’t need to worry about deportation.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:
that

Then you have the problem —

The ones who get In here by fraud,

do.
MR. GLOBMAN:

Right.

15

QUESTION:

Well* this statute does not cover those

smuggled in.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

Those who get in surreptitiously and

that is the very large group of illegal immigrants in our
country.
MR. GLOBMAN:

That is correct. * This is to procure

entry by fraud or misrepresentation and to —
QUESTION:

I gather, though, in Errico, it was

obtaining a visa by fraud,
MR. GLOBMAN:

Or false misrepresentation.

MR. GLOBMAN:

That is correct and

And whereas here you didn’t obtain a

visa — your clients evaded the requirement.
MR. GLOBMAN:

That is correct.

And you obtained your entry by fraud.

MR. GLOBMAN:

there can’t be any difference In light of the literal -™

Kow about the legislative history?

How

far does the legislative history go?
MR. GLOBMAN:

Let me say this — the Court in the

Second Circuit admitted that under the literal translation,

entitled to this relief.
Now, in the history of the statute, the Ernieo case

involved.

There is very little

It traces the history from the Refugee Acts, the

Displaced Persons Acts and it takes it to 1952 with the
McCarron Act, which was a harsh law and then takes it back
to the present act, this specific section in 6T.
Nov/, perhaps if I could refer to the material
on the Errico — the Court, in the Errico decision said,
"The misrepresentation section was not the only provision of
the 1952 legislation that was widely thought to be unnecessarily harsh and restrictive and in 1957, Congress passed
legislation alleviating in many respects restrictive pro­
visions of th'e earlier legislation.
"The purpose of the 1957 Act is perfectly clear
from its terms, as well as from the relevant House and
Senate Committee reports.
"The most important provisions of the Act provide

17
for a special nonquota status for the adopted children or
illegitimate children of immigrant parents and for orphans
who have been or are to be adopted by United States citizens.”
And then it goes on to say, "The intent of the Act
is plainly to grant exceptions to the rigorous provisions
of the 1952 Act for the purpose of keeping family units
together.
"Congress felt that in many circumstances it was
more important to unite families and preserve family ties
than it was to enforce strictly the quota limitations or
even the many restrictive sections that are designed to keep
undesirable or harmful aliens out of the country.”
QUESTION:

Now —

Mr. Globman, if we uphold your position

here, what is to prevent any number of people from coming
.in surreptitiously and then testifying two or three years
later, yes, I did go to the customs agent at Chula Vista and
I said I was an American citizen.
And, presumably, if it is an informal contact, no
one will be able to say no to that, and then just get in under
this provision.
'!

MR. GLOBMAN:

■

Then I think you are involved in the

credibility of the individuals as —
with
QUESTION: We11,/someone who would commit fraud in
the first place, I presume, we may have doubts as to his
credibility in general.

18
MR. GLOBMAN:

I think you take the whole person.

In the specific case, when he — when the person becomes
involved with the immigration authorities, he goes through
an exhaustive investigative process by the investigation
department before charges are brought.
There is an investigation of the applicant or, in
this case, the alien and upon the basis of the investigation
made by the investigators in the Immigration Service, charges
are brought.
Now, then, these charges are tried before what is
presently known as an immigration judge, formerly the
special inquiry officer and at this hearing, the burden of
proof is upon him to prove himself.
In other words, the credibility of the individual
is considered by the immigration judge.
QUESTION:
here.

Well, but that has all been bypassed

There is no problem about credibility here.

You have

conceded that your clients got in by falsely l'epresenting
that they were American citizens.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, how does credibility come into

play In a situation like this or the hypothetical

that

Mr. Justice Rehnquist postulated?
MR. GLOBMAN:

My answer is that, in answer to

Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question — hypothetical question —

19
Is that
ty.

there Is the opportunity for a judgment of credibili

The justice a3ked — now, three or four years after

a man gets into the country, no matter how he gets in. If he
then says before the department or the service that he
presented himself as a U. S. citizen at an entry point, my
answer is that you take the total person.
It Is a question of credibility.

He proves him­

self out.
QUESTION:

He proves that he committed fraud.

MR. GLOBMAN:

He proves that he has committed fraud

but he also proves vrhat the fraud is.
QUESTION:

Not voluntarily, however.

He has done

it under the compulsion of being deported if he doesn't do
some explaining.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

No question.

Well, now, going back to this language

that someone else asked about.

I am following the exact-

language of the statute, 241(F) — "Shall not apply to an
alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who is the
spouse."
Now, do you say that cannot be read or has meaning
that he was the — is the spouse, parent or child of a
citizen at the time of the entry?
MR. GLOBMAN:

I say that is how the Errico case

read it because that is how the

20

QUESTION:

You are talking about the language of

the statute now.
MR. GLOBMAN:
way.

Yes.

I suppose it can be read that

I mean that even the clearest language means different

things to different readers.
To me it
QUESTION:

doesn’t read that way.
Well, but it is understandable that

a person might have a parent in the United States or a child
in the United States and come from another country, present
himself for admission and be otherwise admissible in all
respects, but at the very time that the misrepresentation is
made, have this qualifying condition of having parent or
child on the other side — on our side of the border.
MR. GLOBMAN:

I think if that is what the Section

is saying, I think it would say it in this manner, "Who is,
at the time of entry, a spouse, parent or child."
To me, that would be lucid in carrying out your
question.
QUESTION:

Well, you have got "at the time of

entry" just preceding it.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And you’d want it to — you say it

should be repeated again.

"Otherwise admissible at the time

of entry — who is at the time of entry."

You’d want that

repeated again to have the meaning that I suggest.

21
MR. OLOBMAN:
QUESTION.*

Umn hmn.

And the Court of Appeals, the Second

Circuit, read It somewhat the way I suggested it.
MR. GLOBMAN:

Now,'"at the time of entry',' as I read

this, or "excludable at the time of entry
QUESTION:

Yes, right.

MR. GLOBMAN:

I take the other tack to that.

It would be lucid if it stated that, to follow out
your thought, to carry out your thought or your construction
of the statute, it should read, "Who, at the time of entry
is" or "Who is, at the time of entry —"
QUESTION:

"Was"

is what you want, because every­

thing else is in the past tense.
Your strongest argument is that everything else
is in the

past tense.

They "Were excludable at the time of

entry," or "have procure! visas or other documents."

See?

If

it was talking about the time of entry, it is in the past
tense or the perfect tens.3 and this is in the present tense.
And the

statutory provision has to do with

deportation of aliens within the United States and since this
is the present tense, it wculd seem that you would argue
that it means now that they Vave spouses or children who are
citizens.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

I —

See, if it is talking to the time of

22

entry, that statutory —
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— provision, it is always either in

the past tense or the perfect tense, not in the present tense,
see?
MR. GLOBMAN:

Well, but I feel that if this is

what the meaning is —
QUESTION:

I know what you feel the meaning is,

and that —
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:
Justice suggested

Right.

— to make it mean what the Chief
it might mean, you would argue that the

is would have to be a was.
MR. GLOBMAN:

Well, I say, what the statute is

saying who "Shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible
at the time of entry," and then it says, "Who presently is
the spouse, parent or child of a United States citizen."
I think I am consistent In my argument that this
present tense carries out, at the time of —
QUESTION:

Deportation.

MR. GLOBMAN:

The time of

deportation, yes and

bringing it up to the time when the Government is calling to
account the alien.
QUESTION:

But I understood you to say earlier

that he was not otherwise admissible if he had told — he

23
would not have been otherwise admissible had he told the
truth.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

He would not have been admitted.

MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Had he told the truth —

He would not have been admitted, no.

So that is the first hurdle that you

have to get over, isn’t it?
MR. GLOBMAN:

Yes.

However, we are saying that we are in the same
situation —
QUESTION:

Why, under the statute, isn’t a person

who just is smuggled in entitled to the benefits of the
statute?
MR. GLOBMAN:

A smuggler doesn’t overtly orally

present himself for inspection and commit a misrepresentation.
QUESTION:

Well, he doesn’t present himself for

inspection if he says, "I am a citizen of the United States
either.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

He does.

Well, he doesn’t.

As an alien, he

doesn’t submit himself to inspection as an alien,
MR. GLOBMAN:

Under the statute

Immigration Act ~~
QUESTION:

Under the prior law, prior to this, when

people misrepresented their nationality, they had to show that

24
it wasn't — that It was for the purpose of avoiding some
kind of persecution in some country which — and I suggest —
I suggest that the contrary argument is that the statute
intends the alien to have submitted himself as an alien.
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:
a

The language

Because submitting of — saying he is

citizen is just like — is not submitting himself as an

alien at all.
MR. GLOBMAN:

The Act does not say that he pre­

sents himself as an alien.
QUESTION:

I know, it says "entering.”

MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Entry is defined as an entry by an

alien.
MR. GLOBMAN:

No, the coming — yes — see, every

Immigration Inspector has the right to examine any individual,
whether he claims to be a citizen or whether he claims to be
an alien and even citizens can be held and made to prove
their citizenship.

They can be held, detained and held until

such time that they sustain the

burden of proving that they

are U. S. citizens.
QUESTION:

I understand.

I understand that.

I

am just suggesting that perhaps the statute should be
construed to mean that its benefits are extended to those
who enter as aliens.

And, in the process, commit fraud, a

fraudulent visa or some other kind of false documentation.MR. GLQBMAN:
not read that way.

the statute —*
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t know.

That doesn't

necessarily follow.
QUESTION:

On your theory, the person who affirma­

tively commits the fraud of lying about his American citizen­
ship is in a better position than the fellow who doesn’t
affirmatively commit any fraud, .just walks across the border
at some isolated spot on the Canadian woods or —
MR. GLOBMAN:

But that is correct because he has

given the Service an opportunity of checking his statements.
Now, the fellow who crosses at a border where there
is no border-crossing point or who comes in the trunk of an
automobile or is a stowaway at a point of embarkation never
presents himself before a U. S. Immigration Inspector.
QUESTION:

And you say because this man presented

himself under the false colors of an American citizen, he is
in a better position than the fellow who just walked across
the border?
MR. GLOBMAN:
QUESTION:
American passport.

He is.

Suppose that Mr. Reid had had a forged
Would that make the case different?

MR. GLOBMAN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEWEL S. LaFONTANT
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MRS. LA. FONTANT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

PLease the Court:
I’d like to review the

facts very briefly again.

Petitioners who are citizens of British Honduras

27
and married to each other enter/the United States at Chula
Vista, California, which is on the Mexican border by falsely
stating that they were citizens of the United States.
The husband arrived in November '68 and his v/ife
followed January *69 and nine months thereafter gave birth
to her first child and in *71 gave birth to a

second child.

Of course, the children are American citizens.
Three years after Mr. Reid's arrival, he was —
they were served with petition to show cause, an order to
show cause why they shouldn’t be deported because they entered
the United States as aliens, deportable under 24l (A)(2) as
aliens who had entered the United States without Inspection
as aliens, claiming to be citizens of the United States.
They admitted that they had entered fraudulently
by claiming United States citizenship.

They admitted that

they had not secured a visa upon entry and they also admitted
that they did not present themselves to the Immigration Office
for inspection as aliens.
However, they denied the legal conclusion that they
are deportable, contending that Section 241(F) of the Act
waives deportation in the case of aliens otherwise admissible
at the time of entry who have procured entry to the United
States by fraud or misrepresentation and have close family
ties in the United States.
The Special Inquiry Officer upheld the charge that

28
they were deportable and the Board of Immigration Appeals
dismissed their appeal, claiming that aliens who circumvent
the entire visa issuance process and inspection process are
not eligible for relief under 241(F).
The

Petitioners then applied for the privilege

of voluntary departure and claimed that they would be willing
to leave under the conditions and at the time set forth.
And I might add at this point* Mr. Justice Brennan,
this is the point where the Special Inquiry Officer for
this purpose found them of good moral character and granted
their petition.
No Special Inquiry Officer found them of good
moral character at the time of entry.

And that is your argument.

MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Because all we have is their sayso.

MRS. LA FONTANT:

That is correct, your Honor.

Although the privilege of voluntary departure was
granted, Petitioners did not leave but, instead, filed a
petition for review and the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the deportation order.
Since this decision is in direct conflict with two
decisions of the Ninth Circuit, Lee Fook Chuey and Echeverria,
the Government did not oppose the petition for certiorari
and feels that this issue should be resolved by this Honorable
Court.
Petitioners, in contending that they are not
deportable under Section 241(F), rely very heavily on the
case of Immigration Service versus Errloo.

32

Errico really involves two cases that were
consolidated because of the one issue involved.
We respectfully submit that Errico is limited —
is distinguishable from this case and is limited to its
own facts and stands for the proposition that quantitative
limitations — that is, quota restrictions —- cannot preclude
an alien from being otherwise admissible x?ithin the meaning
of 241(F).
In one of the cases, Mr. Errico»

Is it distinguishable because it is

QUESTION:

And.

they are not very happy with the

Errico decision.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Very — not happy at all.

But

still, we feel that, even though, in spite of our displeasure
with Errico that it can be distinguished from this present,
the instant case.
In the — a Mr. Errico, a native of Italy, in
order to get a higher quota preference, deliberately mis­
represented to the Immigration authorities that he was a
skilled mechanic, experienced in the

repair of foreign

automobiles.
Ke was granted his first preference quota.

He

33
was lawfully admitted as a permanent resident and he and his
wife entered the United States in 1959 and thereafter a
child was born.
Mr. Errico had gotten an immigrant visa.
In the other case* a Miss Scott, a native of
Jamaica, entered into a — in order to get a nonquota status,
entered into a sham, bogus, proxy marriage with an American
citizen with whom she never lived and with whom' she never
intended to live.
She thereafter had an illigitimate child in the
United States, after having been admitted here in 1958.
In both Scott and Errico, in seeking entry, they
not only admitted their alienage, that is, put the immigration
authorj.tj.es on notice that here v/e are, two aliens coming
into the United States.

They had to present valid, unexpired

immigrant visas and prior to the issuance of that visa, they
both had to complete background questionnaires -Which went

and in Jamaica in the

34
And after that and only after that, a passport
was issued and thereafter, they both were inspected at the
port of entry into the United States.
Now, when it is said by Petitioners that the Reids,
the Petitioners here, were actually inspected at the border,
that i3 impossible because they have admitted that they
falsely claimed that they were citizens and although we
don't have any definition of inspection in the Immigration
Act, we can just look at Black's Law Dictionary and see what
inspection means and we can use it.
Inspection is a critical examination, a close or
careful scrutiny, a strict or prying examination or an
investigation.
In the instant case, the Petitioners concealed
their alienage completely and thus avoided any investigation
by the authorities.
Since citizens coming into the United States are
not required to go through inspection. Petitioners were
able to evade any investigation.
And Mr. Justice'White is perfectly correct when he
states that entry concerns aliens.

A United States citizen

really cannot make an entry under the Immigration and
Nationality Act and I turn to Section 1101 of the Immigration
and

Nationality Act that

defines entry as "any coming of

an alien into the United States — any coming of an alien

35
into the United States from a foreign port or place or out­
lying possession.
Now, the purpose of the two-step inspection process,
that is, the visa issuance on one hand and the inspection at
the border is for the main purpose of determining whether or
not an alien is admissible or excludable and it also serves
the purpose of keeping tab on or keeping track on aliens
once they come into this country and it' is crucial to a lawful
admission that an inspection be made.
Section 1225 of 8 United States Code requires that
all aliens shall be examined by Immigration officers at the
discretion of the Attorney General but no such mandate was
enacted as far as United States citizens are concerned.
Now, let's look at the language of Section 241(F)
itself, which provides in pertinent part,

"The provisions

of this section relating to the deportation of aliens on the
ground that they were excludable at the time of the entry as
aliens who have procured entry into the United States by
fraud or misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien other­
wise admissible at the time of entry who is a spouse, parent
or child of a United States citizen."
The Government submits that Section 241(F) is not
intended to apply to Petitioners and, as the language indicates,
is quite limited in scope.
It doesn’t waive ail grounds for deportation of

36
persons who are closely related to United States citizens
but only waives deportability on the ground that they were
aliens excludable at the time of entry for having procured
documents of entry through fraud.
Furthermore, it applies only if the aliens were
otherwise admissible at the time of entry and what does
that mean?
If an alien avoids the entire visa-issuance
inspection process, how can it be determined that he is
otherwise admissible at the time of entry?
Were we dealing with simple objective facts that
could be easily ascertained years afterwards, we wouldn’t
have so much of a problem and that was the situation in
Errico.
But I submit it would be virtually impossible,
years later, to determine whether or not the Petitioners
were, in fact, otherwise admissible at the time they entered
this country in ’68 and '69.
The important phrase is, I submit, Mr. Chief
Justice, is that the time of entry applies to "otherwise
admissible,'' rather than whether or not the Petitioners are
the parents of children or married to an American citizen
at the time of entry.
It refers, the "otherwise admissible," refers to
aliens otherwise admissible at the time of entry.

37
QUESTION:

You say they were not otherwise

admissIble.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

That is correct.

Well, and I ain

saying that it had to be determined at that time because,
with the passage of time —
QUESTION:

You are saying there is no way to know

whether they were otherwise admissible.
MRS. LA FONTANT;

That is right and then to try to

reconstruct it six years later, in this case, would be an
impossible task because we know that evidence dissipates,
witnesses move or die and we also have to remember that this
information vrould have to be gotten from the aliens' homeland.
QUESTION:

Of course, in the Brrico case, it

wasn’t that there was no way to know that they vrere otherwise
admissible.

There was a way to know and the fact is, they

were not otherwise admissible and yet the Court held the
statute applied to them.
MRS. IA FONTANT:

They didn't -- they did not find

that they were not morally, physically, or mentally or other­
wise admissible.
QUESTION:

No, but it was clear that they were not

within the quota and they were not otherwise admissible.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

So they — they had no way — they

didn’t have to go any further.

They said that the quota

restriction — they could determine that and —

38
QUESTION: And under that, they were not otherwise
admissible.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Yes, but they also, in the

Errioo case — they also tied in the charge with the fraud
and when they said ''otherwise admissible,” they meant
otherwise in not being

eligible for the quota which means,

in my interpretation of it that they meant "otherwise
admissible" to apply to the qualitative part, that is,
whether or not they were mentally, morally and physically
admissible at the time of entry.

But the quota, they took

on its face that — and I — I am not carrying a brief for
Errico, but —
QUESTION:

No, I am not, either but I just — we

are just agreeing to see where it would help.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Where it is similar, yes.

Well, I gather, Mrs. LaFontant, basically

in any event, your argument is that this statute can apply
only to aliens who presented themselves as aliens —
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Even though, at the time

of presenting

themselves as aliens, they misrepresented some facts.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Which then led to their admission and,

in Errico, I guess it is true.

He did present himself as an

alien, he just falsified facts and reasons to get admission.

39
MRS. LA PONTANTr
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, the Errico certainly didn't deal

with a person who misrepresented his nationality.
QUESTION:

No.

MRS. LA FONT ANT:

That’s — that’s ---- and to me,

that is the big distinguishing — one of the big distin­
guishing factors.
QUESTION:

The '5? Act didn’t forgive people who

misrepresented their nationality, did it?
And I thought this new law, the present law,
wasn’t intended to change that, the subsequent law.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

That’s — that’s true.

And

even in the —
QUESTION:

I read that in a footnote In the

dissent.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Because even when we were trying

to help the refugees with the Displaced Persons Act and the
Refugee Relief Act of '53, I believe, even in those cases
where we were trying to help, it was definitely stated that
anyone who misrepresented his nationality or made any
misrepresentations would be forever barred from coming into
this country and then, later, because of the rigidity of that,
there was an alteration made, but even then it said — they
always had in there, the "otherwise admissible" alien so that
they have never —

QUESTION:

The Second Circuit seems to have never

distinguished Errico on the grounds that the fraud was made
there to avoid the quota restrictions and —

examination at the

border.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Well, one of them went into a fraudulent

MRS. LA FONTANT:

And that was not the Errico case.

There

were two companion cases. One misrepresented his occupational
skills —

That's right.

MRS. LA FONTANT:

And the companion case, the woman In

that case went through a fraudulent marriage with an
American citizen and she never saw him again after the
ceremony.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Right you are.

And then got into this country and then

very soon thereafter had an illigitimate baby and now, there­
fore, she had a — she was related to that baby who was born
in the United States and, of course, she was related to a
United States citizen and the Court held she could not be
deported, despite the fact of her fraudulent entry.
That is correct.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

That’s true.

I mean, those are the facts of those

cases.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

That's true.

But the charge

brought against them was — let's see — the exact charge in
Errico was fraudulently entering — not being eligible for a
quota.

I don't know how it was worded.

Counsel where he —
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Well, he still had to go through

all of the examinations and all.

He lied on one point about

his abilities but he did not evade the whole system and he
was found qualified for admissibility on the basis of being
physically, morally and mentally fit.

And that he possessed skills needed in

this market, this labor market.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes, so he —

That was the key factor that avoided the

quota restriction, was it not?
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Right.

Right.

And the key

factor in the Sco’ct case was that she entered the marriage
and was the wife of an American so that is how she avoided
the quota restriction.

But I interpret Errlco in discussing

MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

All right.

But even after the visa, as you pointed

out, he still had to run the gauntlet of all these questions.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The visa was merely the starting point.

These people, by lying at the point of entry

if, indeed,

they ever, in fact, made such an entry — avoided all of
these inquiries and didn’t give the Government an opportunity
to check them until many years later, a good many years.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Yes.

I’d like —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

after lunch, Mrs. LaFontant.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon from
12:00 o’clock noon to 1:04 o'clock p.m.]

i)i{
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:0^ p.m.
Mrs. LaFontant, you

have about eight minutes left.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Mr.

Chief Justice and

may it

please the Court:
Last week during the argument of

a

case before

this Honorable Court, Mr. Justice Blackmun asked the
Solicitor General of the United States a question that went
something like this:
’'Would it be a disaster if this Court ruled
opposite to your argument?”
If same question were asked of me today, my answer
would be yes, it would be a. disaster.
Certainly the sky would fall in on the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and yes, such an adverse ruling
would cause a paralysis in international, travel, especially
for the 260 million people who enter the United States.
That is the number of people who entered the
United States in 1973.
It would be — represent a paralysis for all of
the United States citizens, 100 million or more who enter
this country every year.
It would be Impossible for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to inspect all of these people.

And

1 might remind the Court that 232 million of these people who

45
enter the United States each year come over the Canadian and
the Mexican borders.
If Petitioners' position was sustained, aliens
would be free to claim United States citizenship falsely and
have an unassailable right to remain here forever.,
Indeed, it is quite possible that, as we have
alluded to before, aliens —
QUESTION:

Well, it is only if they —

MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Apply for 241(F) relief.

Yes, which means that they have to have

close relatives itfho are United States citizens.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Yes.

Yes.

And if you rule

that "otherwise admissible" doesn't mean anything, it would
open the floodgates from these

borders for the people to

come in.
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't be everybody.

It

would just — they ifould have to have —
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Close relatives, those who have—

who are parents —
QUESTION:

Children here.

MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Who are United States citizens.

MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Right.

Definitely.

Definitely.

But you would — I take it your point

is that you would have to do a much closer check on every

46
person who crossed the border claiming to be a United States
citizen.
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTI Oil:

.And that is an impossibility.

And that would be over 100 million

people, if, in fact, you undertook to do it.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Yes.

It would be 100 million

American citizens but you have to inspect all 250 million
who come in, 232 million who come over the border.
It would be an impossible task, we submit.
QUESTION:

Well, they don’t all — all of that

additional 132 million don’t claim to be American citizens,
do they?
MRS. LA FONTANT:
QUESTION:

No.

No.
So your check would be — presuma­

bly you already check, the Government already checks people
who do not claim to be United States citizens.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

That is true.

So it would be

another -QUESTION:

This sort of a check would be —

MRS. LA FONTANT:

— definitely 100 million who

are bona fide American citizens.

We don’t know how many

more.
QUESTION:

And whatever the difference is between

that and the 232 million.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Right.

QUESTION:

Wasn’t something like that tried at

the Mexican border that created an international incident
within the past year or two?
MRS. LA FONTANT:

Yes, where traffic was backed up

for miles and miles and miles.
QUESTION:

I don’t remember —

And the Mexican Government — I don't

know whether we judicially notice

what appears in newspaper

accounts but it was that the Mexican Government made
representations to the State Department of the United States.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

And, as we have alluded to

before, these aliens, with the required child or spouse,
could — well, he could slip over in a car, say, in the
trunk of a car and then acquire a spouse or a child and then
say, I came in as a United States citizen and therfore, if
Petitioners* position would be sustained, would be able to
say, I am entitled to 241(F) relief because I lied about
being a United States citizen.
This would produce a severe enforcement problem
and, as is obvious, because there are hundreds of thousands
of illegal aliens that enter the United States yearly.
Another major enforcement difficulty would be
presented to those who enter as non-immigrants.

That is,

visitors who come in as a non-immigrant, saying they are
going to stay just for a temporary period of time and then a
year later say, well, when I came in, I really intended to

43
stay forever, so, therefore, I am entitled to 241(F) relief
also.
Indeed, aliens who entered innocently could
reasonably press for an equal and absolute right to remain
on the theory that it would seem unfair to treat the innocent
less favorably than the guilty.
Finally, it \fould make a mockery of Congress’
numerical limitations, which we have to presume were reached
after careful study and which also are supposed to tell us
hoiv many people this country can safely absorb.
So we would be doing away with the numerical
limitations completely.
QUESTION:

All of these arguments, or most of

them, were made in the dissenting opinion in the Errico
case.
MRS. LA FONTANT:

That might be one of the reasons

that I am repeating them here, Mr. Justice Stewart and I —
QUESTION:

It seems to me that that was a dissenting

opinion and I have said before up here, I had a professor
at law school that used to tell us that dissenting opinions
were subversive literature.
MRS. LA .FONTANT:

In closing, we might — we want

to ask this Court to consider Errico in its limited fashion,
construe it narrowly and we also would like to ask the Court
that to rule that Section 241(F) certainly does not apply to

49
aliens posing as citizens who evade the complete Immigration
inspection process and* as Mr. Justice Stewart stated in the
dissent in Errico, there is nothing to indicate that Congress
enacted this legislation to allow wholesale evasion of the
Immigration and Nationality Act or as a general reward for
fraud.
Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that the
judgment of the court, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,
should be affirmed.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Ms. La

Fontant.
Thank you, Mr. Globman.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:08 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
