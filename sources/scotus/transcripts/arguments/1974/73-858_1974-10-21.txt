MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Gonzalez versus Automatic Employees Credit Union.
Mr. Latturner, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES 0. LATTURNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LATTURNER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
Mr. Gonzalez brought this action against his
criditor, Mercantile National Bank, challenging the
constitutionality of the repossession and resale provisions
of the Illinois Commercial Code and against the Title
Officer of the State of Illinois, the Secretary of State,
challenging the constitutionality of those provisions of
the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code that authorize and compel
the involuntary transfer — termination and transfer of
certificate of title.
A three-judge court was convened and subsequently
dismissed the action.

A direct appeal was then brought to

this Court and this Court postponed the question of its
jurisdiction pending this hearing.
Mercantile has raised two objections to this
Court’s jurisdiction.
First, that a three-judge court was not properly

4
convened under Section 2281 and, second, that a direct
appeal does not lie pursuant to Section 1253*
Because of the nature of the jurisdictional
questions, a brief review of the underlying facts and a
summary of the lower court's actual holding is necessary.
Mr. Gonzalez had purchased a used automobile
pursuant to a retail installment contract which was, in
turn, assigned to Mercantile.

When Mercantile repossessed

the automobile, they had received an amount in excess of
what was then due and owing on the contract.
Although Mr. Gonzalez had not made one payment,
Mercantile had received an insurance rebate which they
were required to credit to Mr. Gonzalez.
Mercantile, however, credited the rebate to the
final payment, not to the current one, and repossessed the
automobile.
Upon consideration of these facts, the three-judge
district court found that Mr. Gonzalez was not in default
at the time his automobile xias repossessed and they there­
upon dismissed the case for lack of standing.

They held

that the challenged statute provides for a repossession
only in the event of default and, since Mr. Gonzalez was
not in default. Mercantile violated the statute rather

The creditor then resells the car, being able

Q

And had all this happened to Mr. Gonzalez and his

automobile?
MR. LATTURNER:

This had all happened to

Mr. Gonzalez.
Q

And what remedies, if any, had he been given in

the state?
MR. LATTURNER:
remedies.

He had not been given any

He was given neither notice nor a hearing

concerning the creditor’s right to possession of the auto­
mobile.

The repossession is without notice or a hearing.

The transfer of title is without a hearing.

The resale is

without a hearing.
Q

Was there any other remedy available to him under

state law?
MR. LATTURNER:

He could have sued for an

injunction in state court to enjoin the resale of the
automobile.

6
Q

What about conversion?
MR. LATTURNER:

conversion also.

He would have a remedy for

However, the claim in this case is that

due process of law requires that he have a hearing before
he is deprived of bis property and the fact that he may
have a subsequent action for damages does not affect his
ability to bring this action asking for a prior due process
hearing.
Q

If youprevail, what relief would he now receive?
MR, LATTURNER:

lower court —

MR. LATTURNER:

If we prevail here, the case

would be remanded to the three-judge district court for a
determination of whether the creditors and Secretary’s
actions violate due process.
Q

And then

what?

MR. LATTURNER:

If they are determined that they

violate due process, then there would have to be a hearing
either before or concurrently with the repossession and
before the certificate of title is terminated and transferred
to the creditor.

MR. LATTURNER:

MR. LATTURNER:

No, he has not requested the

return of that particular automobile.

He is going for

against the future enforcement and execution of the
challenged statutes and this future relief is very —
Q

Well, were the proceedings under and pursuant to

this statute here?
MR. LATTURNER:

The repossession was pursuant

to Section 9503 of the Illinois Commercial Code.

The

certificate of title was terminated and transferred
pursuant to Section 311^ and llo of the Illinois Motor
Vehicle Code.

They were pursuant to those statutes, with­

out hearing.
When the lower court dismissed the —Q

Mr. Latturner, would you straighten me out on

the insurance?

The insurance payment that Mercantile

received came about because of the cancellation of the
policy, did it not?
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

Corre ct.

And when that happened, was Mr. Gonzales in any

way in default under his contract obligation to keep the
car insured?

8
MR. LATTURNER:

The — I cannot remember the

exact dates of the insurance cancellation and the one
missed payment

were very close together.

I believe the missed payment was — the first
accident was before the missed payment and I believe the
actual cancellation was after the missed payment.

They had

not repossessed at that time, though.
Q

Well, it must have been because there were two

accidents, ^v'er^ there not?
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

There were two accidents, yes.

And I am merely asking whether he was under an

obligation to keep the car insured?
MR. LATTURNER:
keep the car insured.

He was under an obligation to

If not, the creditor is under an

obligation to purchase the insurance, and in this case, the
creditor, Mercantile, had not purchased the insurance.
They had also — had not signed for the release
of the automobile from the repair.

He was in a. dispute with

Mercantile over the entire question of this insurance.
The insurance had been purchased for him by the
creditor.
When the court dismissed the action for lack of
standing because Mr. Gonzalez was not in default, they held
that he did not have standing to adjudicate the denial of
a prior hearing because if he would have had such a

9
hearing, he would have prevailed.

They held, instead, that

only those persons who would have lost a due process
hearing have standing to contest the fact that they were
denied such a hearing.
As noted before, Mr. Gonzalez* automobile, prior
to his intervention in this action, had been repossessed and
the title transferred and resold and the court thereupon
held that his request for an injunction was useless and
that he was not entitled to either declaratory or
injunctive relief.
However, Mr. Gonzalez did not request the return
of that particular car.

He sued to enjoin the future

enforcement of the challenged statute and it is this
prospective relief that is important and necessary to
Mr. Gonzalez.
The repossession and title transfer statutes are
still on the books and are still being enforced.
Q

Is he In default under any new contract?
MR. LATTURNEH:

Q

No, he is not.

Has he bought another car?
MR. LATTURNER:

car on credit.

He has not purchased another

With a credit record already showing one

repossession, Mr. Gonzalez Is particularly vulnerable to
these statutes.
Q

But he is not vulnerable if he hasn*t bought a

10
car.
MR. LATTURNER:

But this is part of these statutes

and the presence of them and their enforcement, are part of
his continuing decision on whether or not to purchase a car
on credit and, if so, whether or not he can maintain and
enforce any rights that he may have against his creditor.
This is the same type of situation as is present
in Super Tire versus McCorkle, where the strike had ended,
all of the strikers went off of welfare, but if there was
ever another labor dispute. Super Tire Company knew that
their strikers could receive public aid payments, that it
would have an effect upon their labor negotiations, it would
have an effect upon their decisions in any negotiating
session.
Mr. Gonzalez' is in the same type of situation,
particularly since he

has suffered one repossession and

it is on his credit record.
This Court has recognized that there are
occasions when a debtor is justified in not making a
payment.

However, future creditors of Mr. Gonzalez cannot

be expected to tolerate such happenings, whatever the
reason.

If he moves into the situation, he would either

have to concede his rights vis-a-vis his creditors, or take
the chance on losing his car.
Q

Mr. Latturner, if your law suit is boiled down now

11

to the proposition that you just feel chilled, if you will,
by the existence of these repossession statutes on the
books, you run into cases, don’t you, like Boyle against
Landry, where — even where First Amendment interests were
allegedly involved and even where the statutes concerned
were criminal statutes.

The court said that just the fear

of a potential application of those criminal lav/s at some
time in the future by the Chicago Police Department — this
case came from your same circuit —> was insufficient to
create a controversy.
MR. LATTURNER:

It is not just fear of the

Q

Well, he —
MR. LATTURNER:

Q

pardon me.

As was pointed out by the three-judge district

court, he has a state remedy for that harm, because It was
the abuse of the statutes, not the proper application of
the statutes.

Isn’t that correct?

MR. LATTURNER:

The entire question of a prior

hearing Is to avoid such an abuse.
Q

But he doesn’t want his car back now, you told us.
MR. LATTURNER:

Q

He has been paid for It.

And he has been paid for it.

invoked in the future by some future asignee of his install­
ment contract if he, sometime in the future, may buy an
automobile on credit.
MR. LATTURNER:

Having been harmed by the statutes,

he also sued as representative of a class and the enforce­
ment and execution of these statutes is still proceeding
with regard to the class.
Having been harmed by the operation of these
statutes, Mr. Gonzalez can represent this class.
Q

What is the class?
MR. LATTURNER:

The class are debtors under

contracts with security interests whereby the creditor has
a right to repossess, according to Illinois law.
If I —

not the use of this

statute, but the abuse of it, the misuse of it.

You’re

not operating under the statute, you are operating outside of
it.
MR. LATTURNER:

In Monroe versus Pape, the

defendants there acted in direct violation of the statutes
and the question was whether, when state officials operate
in violation of a statute, whether there is a cause of
action under 1983 and the court’s holding is that when they
t

act under color of law pursuant to a statute, that even
their violation of it,

Did you sue some state official here?
MR. LATTURNER:

Yes, sir, the Secretary of State.

MR. LATTURNER:

He is included along with

Mercantile National Bank, yes, sir,
Q

Arid did he pay any damages?
MR. LATTURNER:

Q

No, he did not.

But were all the claims against all the

defendants settled by your disposition, your settlement
with what you have described?
MR. LATTURNER:

There were originally four

defendants and — pardon me, four plaintiffs in this case.
Mr. Gonzales ~~
Q

Excuse me, Mr. Latturner, may I ask?

I had not

15
appreciated he had been compensated for his full damage
claim.

Does that put this case in the posture of the

Burney case?

You are familiar with that one?

MR. LATTURNER:

No, as a matter of fact, it would

put the case in the same posture as if he would have gotten
an injunction getting his car back.
111116 Burney case went through a separate pro­
ceeding, not the case at bar, achieving the same results.
Q

Before she got her full payment.
MR. LATTURNER:

She proceeded a completely

separate action, apart from the suit, for the injunctive
and declaratory relief.
This case puts it in the same situation as Moore
versus Qgllvie, where even though the act has happened, the
case is not moot.
Q

Well, let’s see, if the defendant said the minute

you filed your complaint, said, you are dead right, we’ll
give you everything you ask, right now, I suppose you
wouldn’t be in very good shape to litigate up to this
Court, would you?
MR. LATTURNER:

Yes.

I think I would because

the defendants cannot be allowed to continually pay off
individual plaintiffs and particularly poor plaintiffs,
in order to maintain an unconstitutional system of
repossession.
Q

Nobody told him to take this settlement.

16
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

No, that is true.

Then, what is left of your response to the

question?

MR. LATTURNER:

The response to the question is

that, having been injured by the statute, he can sue to
enjoin a future enforcement beca.use the presence of those
laws on the books continue to affect him in his business
dealings of whether or not to purchase a car on credit and,
if so, whether or not he maintains his rights against his
creditors.

It is in that respect no different than Super

Tire versus McGorkle, decided last term.
Q

Now let's get back to my earlier question which

you had not completely answered.
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

Yes.

When Automatic — I assume it was Automatic who

paid — Mercantile —
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

Mercantile.

Mercantile paid the settlement, did that discharge

all the defendants from all liability under 1983?
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

No.

MR. LATTURNER:

Q

And are all his claims against all the named

MR. LATTURNER:

Mo, it did not.

It referred only to the count

It did not even refer to the count for declaratory

and injunctive relief against Mercantile.
Q

Well, may I ask, was there any negotiations in

connection with that settlement that we dismiss
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

None?

That is correct.

They paid the full amount without asking?
MR. LATTURNER:

Q

No, there was not.

That wasn’t even asked for by Mercantile?

MR. LATTURNER:
Q

this suit?

That is correct.

What about the change in rules the Secretary of

State put in?
MR. LATTURNER:

The change in rule by the

Secretary of State was accomplished in order to avoid a
temporary restraining order in this case.

It is a mere

administrative procedural change.
Q

Is it still in operation?
MR. LATTURNER:

Pardon?

They are still in

operation, but they can be as easily shifted back the
morning after this litigation as they were —
Q

Are you satisfied with them as they are now?

19
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

No, I am not satisfied.

Why not ?
MR. LATTURNER:

Because, under the present rules,

the Secretary of State has delegated what should be his
duties and responsibilities to the creditors.

Thus, the

notice of the proposed application for the new certificate
of title is drated and sent by the creditor.
The creditor drafts a proposed affidavit of
defense that may be sent back in.
The affidavit, if the debtor files it, is sent,
not to the Secretary of State, but to the creditor.

The

Creditor then can determine whether or not it is a valid
affidavit of defense and if he rejects it and then applies
for a new certificate of title stating that an affidavit
was not received.
There is never any hearing or notice sent by the
Secretary.
Q
was moot.

Let’s assume we decided chat we thought the case
Would we

should we take action on that or

should we determine whether the case is properly here in
this Court at all?
MR. LATTURNER:

1 think you have to determine

whether the case is properly here first.
Q

So that the question of whether this case was

required to be heard by a three-judge court and whether,

20

even If it was properly here are threshold issues?
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

Correct.

You are going to say something about those, I

gather.
MR. LATTURNER:
my time has expired.

I was getting to them.

I notice

I would like to — well, pardon me,

let me stay with those for a moment.
The action was brought against a state official,
the Secretary of State, suing to enjoin him from the enforce­
ment and execution of state statutes of statewide
application, determination and transfer provisions of the
Illinois Motor Vehicle Code pursuant to — because they
violate due process.
Thus, all of the technical requirements of 2281
•'

are met and the only question is whether

i

or not there is

substantial constitutional question against the Secretary.
Mercantile alleges that the Secretary is not the
actual means of enforcement of their statutes, but that
argument could not be more incorrect.

He is the only means

of enforcement of those statutes.
Mercantile also alleges that he is only a nominal
defendant because the certificates of title and their
transfer are meaningless and ministerial.
However, the State of Illinois, by another
statutory provision, provides for due process protection

21
to certificates of title in all instances except when it is
terminated after a repossession.
In all other instances, before the Secretary of
State can involuntarily terminate a certificate of title,
he

must send notice.

issue subpoenas.

He must set a hearing.

He must

He must hold the hearing and his decision

is subject to judicial review.
Q

Hay I ask you, could the determination — the

district court — that was made by a three-judge court?
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

Yes, it was.

Could that determination with respect to standing

have been made by a single judge?
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

No, it could not.

You mean ™ couldn’t the single judge look at

the complaint and say — and decide there is no standing
in this case without getting to the three-judge court
question?
MR. LATTURNER:

Under Idlewild versus Epstein,

when an application for a three-judge court is made, the
single judge must look to see if the technical requirements
are met and if the substantial constitutional question is
alleged.
Q

All right, well what about technical requirements?

What about that?
MR. LATTURNER:

State officer.

State statute of

22
statewide application.
Q

How about a proper plaintiff?
MR. LATTURNER:

The questions of standing and

mootness are more properly decided, by three-judge courts.
In the past, they have been and this Court has accepted
numerous of those cases on direct appeal.
In making the determination as to standing in
this case, it required an analysis of the statute by the
three-jud:. court.

They went, in reaching the standing

issue- in'o the statutory scheme itself.

It was not a

cursory ; lalysis at the very beginning.
Q

Well, it didn’t require any ruling on validity.
MR. LATTURNER:

(

It just required a construction of the statute.
MR. LATTURNER:

Q

It did not require —

’fhafc is correct.

What is required about a three-judge court?

Why

He

pecifically, by 2284 subparagraph 5, cannot dismiss the
action.
Q

If he decides that there is no cases that it is

moot, are you telling us that a single judge could not
dismiss it as moot?

23
MR. LATTURMER:

If there is a substantial

constitutional question, the proper procedure is to
convene the three-judge court.
Q

That is not quite an answer to my question.
MR. LATTURNER:

Q

Okay.

Do you say a single judge could not dismiss it?

If he decided that there was no lawsuit there any longer,
there was no case or controversy live in existence and the
case was moot and dismissed.
MR. LATTURNER:
Q

He has no power?

The —
Are you telling us that?

To

do that?
MR. LATTURNER:

He can only decide whether or not

there is a substantial constitutional question.

If he

determines there is no substantial constitutional question,
he can dismiss the case.

If he determines there is a

substantial constitutional question, he must convene the
three-judge court to determine all of the other issues
which may result in either the granting or denial of
relief.
Q

Well, if he decided and recited that he was

holding — that there was no substantial constitutional
question because —- because there was no live case or
controversy and that it was moot, he’d have that power,
wouldn't he?

2 i»

MR. LATTURNER:

Ile would have that power If he

made such a holding.
Q

That comes down to a question of semantics, then,
MR. LATTURNER:

It basically comes down to how

far deeply into the statute and into the case they have to
go and many questions concerning the standing of
go very hard,

mootness

In this case of mootness, they went to the

ultimate issue in the case, whether or not the injunction
should issue.
Clearly, the single judge could not dismiss on
the grounds dismissed here because it involved the direct
explicit denial of an injunction.

•' s settled, there was no longer any case or controversy
pissented here.
Q

Well, when I was in practice, we got rid of the

la: suit if we 'were going to pay anything.
MR. JENNER:

Mr. Justice Brennan, that has

always been my practice in 44 years, but if I can't get
that kind of agreement, I get the best I can get and that
is really what the answer is here.

26

May it please your Honors s there is the threshold
issue of whether this Court has jurisdiction at all, which
I will discuss.

There then follows whether the case is

moot, which I wi11 discuss, and also whether the plaintiff
has standing.
There is a measure of confusion with respect to
what the facts are here and cases are best determined on the
facts and may I be helpful to the Court and review, just for
a minute or two — or four or five minutes of my time —■ as
to the facts in the case.
First, this is an attack upon the constitutionality
of sections 503 9 50*1 and 507 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
As this Court knows, the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code
is the most pure of all the codes in the 49 states and in
the Virgin Islands and especially 503, 504 and 50?
original code.

of the

Chapter —

This is Article 9, 503, 504, 507, was reexamined
by the American Law Institute and by the Uniform Law
Commissioners in 1973 and the whole chapter was rewritten
so that you have presented here a carefully-thought~out and
considered system with respect to the administration of
motor vehicle repossessions and effort on the part of the
American Law Institute and the Commission as to prepare a —
have a system which comports as near as may be and princi­
pally with due process.

27
Now, this 503, 504 and 507* may your Honors
please, is before you on applications for certiorari in
several cases which your Honors have deferred, presumably
awaiting the argument of this particular case.

So that the

merits of the constitutionality of the self-help repossession
provisions of the Uniform or Commercial Code are awaiting
your decision as to whether you will accept, on certiorari,
this several — I think there are four, maybe five — that
are now pending before you which you haven’t acted on.
Important here is the fact that thb.t issue was
not determined by the district court, the three-judge court
here at all.

The merits of unconstitutionality have been

unconstitutional of 503, 504 and 507 — is not before the
Court.
The dismissal here was on purely procedural
grounds.
Now, Hr. Gonzales purchased this Pontiac used
car on the 22nd of January, 1972.

He made a down payment

and then he was to pay 15 monthly installments thereafter
of $120.74, commencing on the 28th of February of the
following month.
He paid that first installment.
He paid none other, to this day, at any time.
Now, the contract provided, consistent with
sections 503, 4 and 7, that on default, the creditor was

28
entitled to immediate possession with or without judicial
process.

The contract expressly so provides.
Sections 503 and 504, as has been said in all of

the cases that are now pending before you on certiorari are
pure codification of the old common law doctrine that you
may enter into a contract of self-help possession upon a
proper default.
This contract was assigned to Mercantile by the
used car dealer.
Nov;, he was

Gonzalez was involved in two

automobile accidents; one on March 26th, '72, one on
April 16, 1972, resulting in repairs that had to be paid
of $542.68.
The insurance company only paid $322.

On April

18th, the insurance company, in the face of two accidents —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

right after lunch, Mr. Jenner.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon
from 12:00 o’clock noon to 1:02 o’clock p.m.]

29

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:02 p.m.
Mr. Jenner, you may

resume.
MR. JENNER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I wouldn’t want the members of this Court to think
that I was having the client pay money to settle a particular
claim without some good reason.
On the l6th of August, 1973s the district court,
three-judge court entered an order dismissing the entire
case as moot.

That decision was corrected I will, I think
V- .

successfully, argue.

There remained, however, the damage

claim, count four and while, since the issues Involving
constitutionality and the injunction under the Injunction
Act were moot and the damage claim would then drop also,
I was concerned that that particular matter still remained
at large and that this was in the nature that' we knew

my

distinguished and. able, dedicated opponent had in mind
making this a test case.
But the record should be made clean.

Since he

would not agree to dismiss the whole case in the payment of
the $750, we just went ahead and paid it and that at least
dropped that one possible

viable claim and that was the

reason.
Q

But nevertheless, did you understand that the

30
damage settlement, or damage payment was in satisfaction of
all kinds of damages that might have resulted from this
taking?

MR. JENNER:
Q

Yes, it did.

A damage that might have resulted from a taking

without notice as well as the cost of the car?
MR. JENNER:
Q

The alleged wrongful taking.

That does raise a Burney question, then, doesn’t

it?
MR. JENNER:
Q

I beg your pardon.

That raises a Burney question, then, doesn’t it?

You know, the lady who had a. claim which, before the case
got here, was fully satisfied by complete payment?

Burney

and Indiana.
MR. JENNER:
Q

Oh, the Burney case, yes,

Yes.
MR. JENNER:

in a moment or two.

I intend to advert to that, if I may,
I also say, if your Honors please, I

did mention that the constitutional issue is not involved
here because the case was

dismissed for mootness.

I did advert to the fact that there are several
petitions for certiorari pending before this Court.
In that connection, there are eight decisions of
courts of appeal in this nation in all of which sections
503, 504, 507 were sustained, have been sustained as to

31
constitutionality.

Those eight cases are in six courts of

appeals, the Ninth, the Eighth, the Fifth, the

Third, the

Sixth and the Second.
Five of those eight cases are pending on certiorari
in this Court.

In the first of those cases, that is, Adams

versus Southern California First National Bank, the
permanent editorial board of the Uniform Commercial Code
consisting, as you know —•
Q

Are you going to argue about the three-judge

court or are you —
MR. JENNER:

I am not going to argue about the

three-judge court because we did not move nor did we contend
that the three-judge court was imporperly convened.
Q

Do you think it is essential that that — do you

think we should determine whether we have jurisdiction here?
MR. JENNER:

Yes, and may I turn directly to that

point.
Q

That is what I was asking, yes.
MR. JENNER:

Finishing, if I may, Mr. Justice

White, the facts so we511 have the perspective.

The

insurance company cancelled the insurance on the 18th of
April with respect to the two accidents, one occurring in
March and one occurring in April and rebated $229.84 of
the unearned premium.
The repairs were $542.68.

Mercantile

32

repossessed the repaired automobile on the 25th of April
and paid the repairman at that particular time his repair
bill of $5^2.

So it was a quiet talcing of possession.

Now, it is alleged in the complaint and since
the case was disposed of on the pleadings, it is alleged
in the complaint that Mr. Gonzalez was not in default at
the time of the repossession,
If you take the
that is probably not so.

figures, it would appear that
That he was, in fact, in default,

but for the disposition to this case, the case was taken
on the pleadings and so it is presumed, on the pleadings ■—
there has been no proof taken on this case whatsoever ----that at the time of the repossession, Mr. Gonzalez was not
in default.

So it was a --- on the pleadings of this, it was

a wrongful taking.

So it was a breach of 503 and 504

because 503 and 504 permit self-help only there is a default
under the contract.
The Mercantile, having repossessed under the
Illinois statutes dealing with issuance of certificate
of

title, which do not affect those certificates that are
[in effect[?]
not, in fact,[affect actual title and the statute sc
provides.
The certificate of title is issued for the purpose
of recording, for keeping track of the car from a policeman
point and that sort of thing and driver's license.

It Is

33
a. ministerial act.
A repossession license was issued under the
Illinois statute,here again, not affecting actual title.
Mow, notice of the sale of the auto — the
repaired used ear — was given to Mr. Gonzalez by registered
mail.

He did not act.

He took no action whatsoever and

the automobile was then sold to a bona fide purchaser and
that bona fide purchaser acquired actual title, as provided
under the statute and also under common law.
That purchaser, in turn, sold to a second party
and whether the automobile has been sold again, we don't
know, but at least we know of those two sales that are
alleged in the pleadings.
Mow, after all this had occurred, after all this
had occurred, Mr. Gonzalez then intervened and

a

pending

suit, the Mojica suit, which is not involved here, and for
the first time, on September 28th, 1972, after all these
months of time had passed, he filed the intervening complaint
which is this matter before your Honors on this particular
case.
So at that particular time, the title of the can
could not be reclaimed in any form, fashion or otherwise,
nor relief of the district -— three-judge district court —
and as we urge here — no relief whatsoever could be granted
to Mr. Gonzalez at the time he filed this suit that would

be of any possible benefit to him.
Now, to a dedicated and able young lawyer, as
Mr. Latturner is, the Legal Services Group in uptown
Chicago, it appeared to him that here was a case in which
the issue, broad issue of the constitutionality of the
Uniform Commercial Code re self-help repossession provisions
could be obtained and so he filed the claim at that
particular time.
Now, the district court, the three-judge,
dismissed this case because of mootness and lack of
standing and that is the first point, Mr. Justice White,
on a — it is our —
Q

You said mootness or just standing?
MR. JENNER:

Mootness and standing, both.

It was

dismissed because of mootness and lack of standing.
Having done that, it is the position —Q

You mean, lack of a case or controversy?

Is that

it?
MR. JENNER:

Lack of a case or controversy.

Lack

of a case or controversy, mootness and lack of standing in
the sense of the absence of the right of the plaintiff to
maintain the suit in his own name and the suit on behalf of
the alleged class.
Nov/, it is our position that there is no direct
appeal, under the three-judge pact, to this Court, forcing

35
this Court to accept the case or on examination of the
jurisdiction of —
Q

Well, why was the three-judge court required?

If it was.

If It was.
MR. JENNER:

Because, under the counts of the

complaint, the Secretary of State of Illinois was made a
party defendant, as a purely nominal party.
As you will notice, the Attorney General of
Illinois is not before this Court and the Secretary of
State is not before this Court.

They just ignored the

case.
Having the Secretary of State as a party
defendant, we say nominally, it was the position of counsel
for Mr. Gonzalez that that involved state action to bring
the case within the injunction provision.
Q

Mr. Jenner, you say the state — the Secretary

was a nominal party,

Do you mean by that that no relief

was sought against him?
MR. JENNER:

No, I don't.

I mean that his

function here is so peripheral, that is, issuing a
certificate of title, that is, this ministerial act of
issuing a certificate of title when advised following a
sale or that

repossession, that the automobile has sold,

has been sold and now is in good title in someone else and
the statute provides expressly that only when the Secretary

36
of State is, in fact, advised that title has, in fact,
passed, does he issue, or may he.issue, a certificate of
title.
Q

Well, couldn’t a single judge make the determina­

tion the three-judge court made, no matter what other issues
were down the line if the determination is made otherwise
on mootness?
MR. JENNER:

It is our position that that is

clearly so, that a single judge, here,could have.
Q

But you don’t know that at the start of the suitMR. JENNER:

We don’t know that a.t the start of

the suit.
Q

But it is just from the face of the complaint

that you have to determine that this man doesn’t have
standing.
MR. JENMER:

That is correct, Mr. Justice White,

and that is what the three-judge court did, including the
single district judge, Judge Austin.
Q

You think that the single judge could have made

whatever determination was made here?
MR. JENNER:
Q

I do, on the pleadings.

In which event it goes to the court of appeals.
MR. JENNER:

In which event, it goes to the court

of appeals which is where this case should have gone, Instead
of burdening this Court with a direct appeal from the

37
three-judge court.
Q

Do you think a single judge would have disagreed

with the three-judge court and decided it was not moot?

Then

it would have to go back to a three-judge court.
MR. JENNER:

Yes, if the three — Mr. Justice

Douglas, if the -- after the convening of the three-judge
court, in my judgment, the single district

judge could

have Entered an order dismissing the case.
Q

Because it was moot?
MR. JENNER:

Q

Because it was moot.

Was it argued before the single judge?
MR. JENNER:

We never argued it before the single

judge because —
Q

All right.

Well, how could he decided if

you

didn't argue?
MR. JENNER:
Q

How did I what?

Hoi? could he decide it if you didn’t argue?
MR. JENNER:

Well, I was ansx\rering Mr. Justice

White's question in the abstract, that it is my judgment
that the district judge could, as of his oum, have dis­
missed this case as being moot.
Q

Without any argument from anyone?
MR. JENNER:

Q

Without any argument from anyone.

Well, on direct appeals, they are only cases that

must be tried by a three-judge court, must be decided by a

38
three-judge court.

Mot that are, but must be.

MR. JENNER:

Must be.

That is one point.

Must

be decided by a three-judge court and, secondly, it is our
position that a direct appeal from this Court under the
three-judge court act, applies -- does not apply when the
dismissal is on procedural grounds.
Q

Well, would this be — even if the three-judge

c ourt were properly convened, the judgment it entered is
not not correctly appealed?
MR. JENNER:

Does that enter into it?

That is my position.

That is the

correct position we argue in this case.
Q

And if the plaintiff feels aggrieved, he can go

to the court of appeals.
MR. JENNER:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

If they agree with him, then they send it back

and direct the convening of a three-judge court.
MR. JENNER:
Q

That is correct.

So if the three-judge court were convened and it

looked at it all and said, well, this is a frivolous
constitutional question, the federal district court has no
jurisdiction, dismissed.
MR. JENNER:

That goes to the court of appeals.

That goes to the court of appeals.

It is not, as my learned opponent argues in his brief,
taking the statute literally.

The statute does say, an

appeal from a dismissal may be taken directly to this Court

39
but —
Q

How is it moot for the one-judge court?
MR. JENNER:

Q
yet.

It was —

In the original pleadings he hadn't been paid

You hadn't paid the damage claim.
MR. JENNER:

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
Q

He didn't have his car.

His car was gone and he

was without his car.
MR. JENNER:

That's right.

The title had passed

so that no relief in connection with that car could be
obtained.
Q

How is it moot then?
MR. JENNER:

court claim.
Q

The damage claim is not a three-judge

It is only ancillary to —-

Well, the other part was to enjoin 'you from the

procedure that you took in seizing his car.
1

And you had

seized it and on his pleadings, you had seized it without
justification.

How is it moot?

MR. JENNER:

Mr. Justice Marshall, the complaint

was filed after the automobile had been seized, repossessed,
after it had been sold twice so that the car could not be —
in other words, no possibility of Mr. Gonzalez again
obtaining his automobile.
Q

That was in your pleadings?

MR. JENNER:

That was in the plaintiff’s pleadings.

The pleading here to which, on which the dismissal was made,
was the plaintiff’s pleading.

It was all laid out in the

complaint as I have stated these facts to you.
Q

Is that because the car had been twice sold since

then?
MR. JENNER:

Yes and notice of the first sale

had been given to Mr. Gonzales as required by statute so he
knew that the car was about to be sold to someone who would
buy it as a bona, fide purchaser, acquire actual title which
could not be defeased by him or anyone else.
Q

And what did you file in response thereto?
MR. JENNER:

We filed an answer to the complaint

and then moved to dismiss.
Q

And what did you allege in your answer?
MR. JENNER:

We alleged in the answer these facts

that I have related to you and alleged also that the
complaint failed to state a cause of action upon which any
relief could be granted.
Q

And on your motion to dismiss, did you ask that

it be dismissed because it was moot?
MR. JENNER:

Because of mootness, because of

lack of standing.
Q

Before the single .judge?
MR. JENNER:

No, before the three-judge court.

41
Q

I was backwards.

You filed nothing before you

went to the three-judge court.
MR. JENNER:
Q

That is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.

That is what I want.

You didn't file a

"suggestion of mootness" any place?

You did not, of

course.
MR. JENNER:

You will forgive my inattentiveness.

May I ask ■—
Q

Oh, I’m sorry.

You of course, you didn't file

anything, but you could have filed a suggestion of
mootness, couldn't you?
MR. JENNER:

Yes, your Honor.

T should say this,

that the three-judge court was convened before I was
retained in this case and when I came into the case with a
three-judge court already in existence wishing to get the
case dismissed because of what I thought wa§ mootness and
lack of standing, I did not attack the three-judge court,
though I think in the first instance, had

I been in it at

the first instance, I would have moved the district judge
to dismiss the case for mootness and lack of standing.
But in any event, the Three-judge Court Act that
provides an appeal for this Court on dismissal, while it
appears on its face to enable an appeal directly to this
Court on any dismissal, as this Court has said, that statute
is to be strictly construed because it is a technical

42
statute and that, in substance, what that appeal provision
provides is that if the decision goes to the issue of
constitutionality of a state statute and the state action,
then, of course, it comes within the spirit and purpose
of the Three-judge Court Act and of the appeal provisions of
that act and a direct appeal to this Court is entirely
proper but where the case is dismissed not involving the
merits whatsoever, which is true here, then, under your
honors’ interpretation of the Phillips

case and others

cited in the briefs, that appeal goes to the court of
appeals and not to the United States Supreme Court to
burden this Court with appeals involving purely procedural
matters
Q

Mow —
How much time, Mr. Jenner, we spend deciding

whether the case should be here or it shouldn't.
MR. JENNER:

I quite agree with you.

I don’t know

what the status of the repeal of the Three-judge Court
Statute is in the Congress,

I do know that the Bar very

much favors the repeal of that statute and I was hoping
that Congress would have acted on it this present Congress
but I don't know whether that is a fact or not.

Let's hope

it will be because the American Law Institute, the Uniform
Law Commissioners and others have urged the American Bar —
urged the repeal of that Three-judge Court Act.
Now, I turn to mootness inquiry of Mr. Justice

^3
Marshall and others.

What Is left here?

has been repossessed.

The automobile

On the face of the pleadings, it was

repossessed in violation of the statute which authorises
self-help repossession only if there is a default.
Notice of the sale was given to Mr. Gonzalez.
He took no action.

Title ~~ sale was held and title passed

so that at the time he filed his suit two and a half —
three and a half months later, there was nothing in this
case insofar as any relief could be granted to him.
couldn’t get his automobile back.

He

He couldn't obtain a

declaratory judgment because the Declaratory Judgment Act
says expressly, in case of a controversy you may apply for
a declaratory judgment.
There is no controversy here between Mr. Gonzalez
and anybody else because he can’t get any relief.
Q

But that isn’t the ™ the three-judge court

didn’t act on the basis that the car had been sold and he
had settled with you, did it?
MR. JENNER:
Q

Well, the —

The three-judge court decided, because there was

a damage remedy under the statute, that he could not ask
for an injunction.
MR. JENNER:

The three-judge court decided — if
that
I may, Mr. Justice White, at the time / this three-judge
court entered its order on August 16, 1973, the damage

44
damage claim called for was still viable, except that if
the case was to be dismissed on other grounds, that is,
under the grounds given the Three-judge Court Act viability,
then the damage claim would fall with the other —
Q

That isn’t what the three-judge court decided.
The three-judge court decided standing because

he said that he wasn't in default, in which event he had a
remedy under the statute, namely, damages.
MR. JENNER:
Q

That is correct.

And so there couldn't be any so-called

"constitutional claim" resulting in an injunction, no
standing to ask for that kind of relief.
Now, you are not arguing that here.
sustaining that reason, I take it.

You are not

Would you really try to

do that?
MR. JENNER:
Q

Would you think they were right on that basis?
MR. JENNER:

Q

Really try to sustain —

I certainly do.

You mean, before any settlement of the damage

claim?
MR. JENNER:
Q

Yes, sir.

That just because there is a damage remedy under

the statute for an improper, wrongful taking.
MR. JENNER:
Q

Yes.

That there is no standing to bring this three-judge

45
court action and ask for an injunction having — and ask
the statute be declared unconstitutional.
MR. JENNER:

I do most certainly urge that

position.
Q

¥ells isn't that the position contrary to the —

what this Court did and the three-judge court did in the
Puentes against Shevln, at least with respect to the
Pennsylvania plaintiffs?
MR. JENNER:
was state action.

Nos I think not and in Puentes, there

In this case there is no state action.

Q

Well, that is a different question.

Q

Now you are swimming off in another ocean.

Q

Right.

Q

You had better — you haven't answered his

question, yet.
MR. JENNER:

I don't think that I am inconsistent

with your Honors' decision in Puentes.
Q

Opinion.
MR. JENNER:

Yes, your Honor, your opinion, the

Court's opinion.
In Puentes, this Court held ~~
Q

Particularly with respect to the Pennsylvania

plaintiffs.

I don't have it too clearly in mind but I

seem to remember that there was an allegation that, at
least on the part of the woman plaintiff, that there had

46
been a wrongful taking there, but that didn't stop the
three-judge court from allowing her to attack the
constitutionality of the basic repossession statute., nor
did it stop this Court from reviewing it.
Am I mistaken?

Is there a difference?

Maybe

there is.
MR. JENNER:

Well, there is this diffeioence that

in Puentes the issues viable for the three-judge court
remained viable but here that is not so.
Q

Just because of events that have happened since.
MR. JENNER:

Well, because the — before the

suit was filed, and in Puentes, the suit, the litigation
commenced very quickly, contemporaneously with the issuance
of the Ritter Republic, in each of those two cases, but
here when one looks at what had commenced, the title had —
to the property had been repossessed, had been sold on
notice and title had passed.
Q

But no settlement?
MR. JENNER:

But no settlement of the damage

claim.
Q

That's right.
MR. JENNER:

That is correct.

That was settled

on December 28th, 1973.
Q

And the court says because he has a damage remedy

under the statute, there is nothing for us to decide here.

47
He has no standing; in the suit, which is — not — what?
Fuentes —Q

And I suppose, Mr. Jenner, even as hard as you

try, you can't persuade us that they were right on that
ground.

I gather you are here in a position where you can

defend this judgment, since you are Respondent

or Appellee,

on any ground that is available to you unless it was a postjudgment settlement intervening today.
MR. JENNER:

Well, intervening, one, as in

Burney and other cases.
Q

And you don't have to fight quite so hard to

defend what they did.
MR. JENNER:

This issue must new be decided in

this Court on the record as it now is before this Court.
Q

I take it that is why you said you .had three

bullets in your gun, standing — jurisdiction, first
standing and mootness.
MR. JENNER:

That is correct, your Honor.

Thank you.
