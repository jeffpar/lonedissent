PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argument next

in No. 73-1942, Erznoznik against City of Jacksonville.
Mr. Maness, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM II. MANESS
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MANESS;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is an appeal from a judgment of the highest

court of the State of Florida in which a decision could be
%
had, which decision upheld the constitutionality of a
Jacksonville city ordinance which makes it unlawful and
provides it is hereby declared a public nuisance to exhibit —
for certain persons to exhibit —- any motion picture in which
the human male or female bare buttocks, human female bare
breasts, or human bare pubic areas are shown if such motion
picture is visible from any public street or public place.
My client Richard Erznoznik is the manager of the
University Drive-In Theatre.

In 1972, shortly after the

passage of this ordinance, he was charged with knowingly
exhibiting a motion picture in which the human female buttocks
and bars breasts were shown, said scenes being visible from
a public street or a public place.
appear in court April 6, 1972.
..

And he was summoned

to

He appeared and by stipulation
'

T.‘,.

the prosecution was stayed in order that we might test the
constitutionality of this ordinance by an action for a

4
declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court of Duval County,
which is the highest trial court.
We filed that complaint.

We had our trial.

The

trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute.

The

district court of appeals affirmed it, relying upon the
Chemline case from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

And the

Supreme Court of Florida denied certiorari by a 4-3 vote.
Now. little more need be said than has been said in
my brief and the brief of amicus Motion Picture Association of
America.

What I would like to emphasize is the total failure

of those who drafted this ordinance and the Florida courts
that have construed it to sharpen its focus and confine its
proscription so as not to censure or punish protected speech.
We do not question the basic constitutional power of the States
and the cities to enact lav/s which punish or inhibit,
unprotected speech or which protects unwilling persons against
obtrusive public displays of explicit sexual material which
are both grossly offensive and unavoidable.
But we do contend that such laws must be carefully
drawn or authoritatively construed so that they are not
susceptible to application to speech protected by the first
and the fourteenth amendments.
QUESTION:

If tills film had been shown in a closed

theater, you wouldn't be here, would you?
MR. MANESS:

I would not.

This was an R rated film,

5
"Class of '74".
QUESTION;

Yes.

X was wondering whether this

isn't a time and place issue rather than a first amendment one»
MR. MANESS:

Well, the reason we don't think it's

a time and place issue—we did plead that in our suit for
declaratory decree — is because basically it gets down to
whether or not the City Council has the power to declare
whatever it pleases a public nuisance.

And in this instance

they nave chosen to declare the mere showing of these
anatomical parts a nuisance.
QUESTION:
MR. MANESS:

So that it seems to me --

Public showing of them a nuisance.
Showing on an outdoor movie screen

visible from a public place.
QUESTION:

What if the ordinance merely provided

that it would be an offense to exhibit any movie of any kind
that was visible from any public street or public place, v?ou!d
that be more objectionable constitutionally or less so?
MR. MANESS:

I would say it would be equally

objectionable because that seeks to — assuming it is
declared a public nuisance also?
QUESTION:

Yes.

The same ordinance as what you

have except it just says any movie of any kind.
MR. MANESS:

I would say it’s an unlawful infringe­

ment on protected speech, visual portrayals, because —
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it be a perfectly good

6
ordinance regulating traffic safety?

You don't want people

driving down the street looking at movies.
MR. MANESS:

Well, if it were related to traffic

safety, then -- well, it wouldn't be unless it was so construed.
If by its very language it just says, "It shall be unlawful to
exhibit on an outdoor screen visible from a public place a
movie."
QUESTION:

Yes; visible from any public street, any

movie.
MR, MANESS:

Well, I think you would have to show

that there is some relationship between —
QUESTION:

Wouldn't there be

a rational relation­

ship?
MR. MANESS:

I don't think so.

Unless you said

where the exhibition is visible from a traveled highway and
there is a showing —
QUESTION:

Generally public streets are traveled,

aren't they?
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:
MR. MANESS:

Well —
More or less.
I would say there is no relationship.

The social benefit to be derived from prohibiting any movie
visible from any public place, it seems to me is not outweighed
in the traffic sense, does not outweigh the first amendment —
QUESTION:

Isn't that a question for the legislature

7
to make initially

as to which social benefit weighs most

\

heavily, if it's acting rationally?
V

MR. 'MANESS:

Well, yes, if it's acting rationally.

\

QUESTION:

And this ordinance could not be applied

\

if the motion picture, for example, that was exhibited at the
time was Snow White, could it?
MR. MANESS:

No, it could not.

QUESTION:
So to that extent there is a distinction
i
drawn which suggests that the purpose of this ordinance was
not traffic safety.
MR. MANESS:
question.

Correct.

I was answering a speculative

But the purpose of this ordinance is definitely

not traffic safety.
QUESTION:

So this ordinance, you say, is more

objectionable under the first and fourteenth amendments than
my hypothetical ordinance would be.
MR. MANESS:

Much more.

As I will, if I get that

far -QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question.

can you be that positive it's not traffic safety?

How

Isn't it

permissible for the Jacksonville City Council to say that foeire
breasts and bare buttocks may be more distracting to drivers
along the highway than the picture of Snow White?
MR.MANESS:

Yes, if they had said that, or if the

court had construed that into it, maybe.

a
QUESTION:

But why does the legislature have to say

all the reasons behind it?

If an argument can now be advanced

that supports the rationale, what more does this Court need?
MR. MANESS:

Well, the same rationale that

we have

been talking about in the "fighting word" cases, that is, that
while you may construe that that way and uphold its validity,
it may not be applied that ivray by the police officer or the
prosecutor who makes the charge.

He may bring the prosecution

simply because he's opposed to nudity in any form

in any time

in any place.
QUESTION:

What difference does the motive

QUESTION:

What does his motive --

MR. MANESS:

Well, as I understand the protection

we afford speech in this country, we are concerned about the
motives of the persons who seek to inhibit it by some means
other than an ordinance or a law that is narrowly drawn or
authoritatively construed to get at only unprotected speech or
unprotected conduct.
Now, if you can put a law on the books that can be
construed in a half a dozen ways, then we violate that principle.
If that principle is to be violated, then this Court can say
so.

But it seems to me if you compare this to the "fighting

words" cases, you have to say if the City of Jacksonville wants
to do that, they have got to draw this ordinance more carefully
or it's got to be authoritatively construed not to infringe on

9

otherwise protected speech.
QUESTION:

Would you say that the City of Jacksonville

could go beyond what has been called obscene by thi3 Court
and make a broader proscription than just obscenity when you
are talking about projecting it beyond the theater walls to
the public?
MRo MANESS:

Yes, I think they probably could,

something more obscene than mere nudity.
QUESTION:

Well, something less obscene than what

this Court has said can be prohibited by the State within the
walls of a theater where everybody has consented to see it.
MR. MANESS:

Well, that's a very difficult question

to answer because I have tried to figure out how this
ordinance could have been authoritatively construed in the
Florida courts to achieve a purpose that does not entrench upon
protected speech, and I don't see how it can.

I don’t sea

bow you can draw such an ordinance.
QUESTION:
it?

What is protected speech as you are using

Is it anything that's not obscene?
MR. MANESS:

No.

It's anything that this Court has

‘‘•a.

held unprotected, such as lewd and obscene, prefane, libelous,
insulting and fighting words, words or portrayals or pictures
that tend to incite immediate breach of the peace or something
of that sort.
QUESTION:

Then you are saying that Jacksonville

3.0
can’t prohibit in an outdoor movie that's projected beyond the
walls of the theater anything that it couldn't prohibit in an
indoor movie»
MR. MANESS:
intend to say that.

No, I'm not really saying that.

I don't

What I intend to say is that, if they

relate it to something that is in fact a nuisance, they can
prohibit images on a screen that would create dangers to the
W £rr.

■

citisens,
QUESTION:

Don't you think, Mr. Maness, for example,

that there are. circumstances in which a State might say as to
an open air movie, that even an exhibition of a picture in
which the actor simply recites the first amendment —
MR. MANESS: They could prohibit it, just like they
r

could prohibit outdoor theaters.
QUESTION:

In the interest of safety.

MR. MANESS:

I suppose they could.

But until they

decide to prohibit outdoor theaters
QUESTION:

Can we be so very sure that isn't what they

are talking about here?
y-*y:4

MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:
park?

Well, I think so.
What about nude performances in the public

Say there’s a summer play

in a public park where --

and it's a municipal — it's in the park, but there's a: law
that says as long as you are showing it in open air and people
can come and go and itss public, no nudity, no nudes in these

11
summer plays in the park.
MR. MANESS:

Is that bad?

Well,, I think it’s a question of --

I think the city fathers could decide that question, like
they decided it on some of the beaches.

Down in Florida

they even had a vote as to whether or not —
QUESTION:
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

You would say that's acceptable.
Acceptable with —
Like saying if you are going to walk down

the street, wear some clothes.
MR. MANESS:

Yes, at this point in history I think

it probably is.
QUESTION:

Do you think the city could have an

ordinance prohibiting sound trucks from operating during
hours, let us say, after 10 o'clock at night?
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think so.
Or at any time that the sound level was

over a certain decibel level?
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

I think so.
What if the candidate

office wants to make a speech?

running for public

That’s one of the highest

forme of first amendment rights, isn't it?
MR. MANESS:

It is, but, you know, it’s a question

of who is making the judgment.
QUESTION:

But you concede that if it's loud enough

so that rationally it can be said that this annoys a lot of

12

people and maybe affects their hearing that then it can be
prohibited?
MR. MAIZESS;

Mr. Chief Justice, I'm under the

impression that under the rales laid down by this Court, that
such an ordinance could be narrowly drawn or authoritatively
construed and upheld, even though it does entrench strongly on
first amendment rights.
But I don't really see the parallel between that and
mere nudity on an outdoor movie screen if you are going to
have any films of any kind.
QUESTION:

What if the city fathers say, "Well, your

screen is so located that anybody who wants to travel

that

street can stop and watch the entire movie, and the fact is
that at this corner the children gather and watch the movies,
and if you want your screen in that location, just don't show
X rated movies if you are going to let the kids gather outside
and watcn it.

If you want it, just clean up your movies a

little."
MR. MANESS:

Well, if they pass an ordinance such as

you are speaking of and related it specifically to traffic,
traffic problems —
QUESTION:

I'm not talking about traffic? I'm talking

about children.
MR. MANESS:

All right, if they related the ordinance

to children, I think they might very well come up with an

13
ordinance that could stand constitutional muster.

This ordinance

isnot related fco any of those things.
QUESTION:

There is evidence in the case that says

who is watching these movies.
MR. MANESS:

Yes, but the children would be outside

watching movies if it was Mary Poppins.
QUESTION:

I know and nobody objects to that, say.

The city ordinance doesn't object to that.

The only thing is

that the parents in town object to this screen showing X rated
movies to their children.
MR. MANESSs

Well, we are not talking about X rated

movies, we are talking about one R movie, "Class of ,74!l.
This is not a —
QUESTION:

I know, but your position covers X rated

movies or any other rated movie.
MR, MANESS:

Right.

QUESTION;
. v

So let’s don't —

QUESTION:

Isn't an R rated movie up to the parent

r

to decide whether the child goes or not?
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, under 17.

Well, the parent has no jurisdiction as

to whether a child .who stands'on the corner will see it.
i

••Mv »

MR. MANESS:

Well, you know, we have other lav/s

such as laws against trespass and littering and other ways of
permitting those who are inside the theater to see what they

14
want to see without interference from those outside the theater.
QUESTION:

But this is restricted to the outside.

MR. MANESS:

This ordinance is restricted,

so

restricted.
QUESTION:

And it merely says you shouldn't show

this picture to children without the parents' consent.
MR. MANESS:

Mr. -Justice Marshall, it doesn't

mention children.
QUESTION:

I know it doesn't, hut that's what happens,

MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

Well, I doubt that's what —
You don't think children are interested

in watching R rated movies?
MR. MANESS:

I think the children go in that want to

see itf you know, they get their parents' permission, they get
in a car and they go in.
QUESTION:

But that's beside the point.

It is beside the point, because I mean

where the parents say, "Don't go to that theater," and then
the child says, "I won't go to the theater to see it," and he
just goes to the corner and looks for free.
MR. MANESS:
QUESTIONS
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

Well —
Right?
That happens.
And that’s part of what this ordinance

is aimed at.
MR. MANESS:

But if he was looking —

15
QUESTIONs

Isn't this part of what this ordinance

is aimed at?
MR. MANESS:

Yes.

And if he were looking at a

travelogue of foreign lands or art museums or a health picture
or even a newsreel, he might also see a bare female breast or
a bare male or female buttocks and that would be the end of
the movie.

So the point is can the movie be suppressed simply

and solely because it has scenes of these anatomical parts in
it, regardless of the context?

And it seems to me that this

case falls right in with the whole line of cases -—
QUESTIONS

To get back to my brother Rehnquist!s

point, I mean, the average person driving down the street if
he sees a bare buttocks on the wall over there, he's going to
look at it.
MR» MANESS:
QUESTION:

Well, if he recognises it as such.
Well, I would assume that the average

person can recognize it.
MR. MANESS:

Well, I have driven by movie screens,

and I'm only speaking from my own experience, and I have seen
figures on the screen and not really known what they were.
I just didn't give that much of attention to it.

You see

movements, you see flashes, you see color.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that in order to

sustain one statute, it must be demonstrated that its reach
is perfect and that either that or in combination with other

16
statutes all such conduct is completely proscribed and
prohibited.

Well, there is no such doctrine of law as that,

is there?
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:

No, not that broad.
Statutes against murder survive even

though murders continue at a very great rate.
MR. MANESS:
'

'•

And we define the degrees of murder

.'! •

first, second, third, manslaughter, justifiable or excusable
homicide.

But we don't define the degrees of offense that we

commit when one scene of nudity comes on this screen.
QUESTION:

Mr. Maness, what is the consequence under

this ordinance if the establishment is declared a nuisance?
Is it just that he is convicted of maintaining a public
nuisance?

Is it a misdemeanor?

MR. MANESS:

It's a low-grade misdemeanor.

It's not

a matter of establishing the theater as being a nuisance, it's
simply the projectionist or the manager or ticket-taker,
subjecting those to a criminal penalty.
QUESTION:

So the word "nuisance" in there is sort

of surplusage in the sens© the ordinance could have said
whoever shows on a screen visible to the public street commits
a misdemeanor.
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION:
ordinary consequence

I would say that's pretty much correct.
I mean, it doesn't have the consequence,
of nuisance of being able to shut it down.

17
MR. MANESS:
QUESTION;

No.
It doesn81. permit the city to shut down

the —
MR. MANESS;

No.

It says it's unlawful and hereby

declared a public nuisance to do this.

But the public

nuisance doctrine, I think, is the justification for inhibiting
it.
QUESTION;

Usually you abate the nuisance.

MR. MANESS;
QUESTION;

Right, they usually do.
The only thing that * s a nuisance is that

single showing, whatever it is.
MR. MANESS:
nuisance.

The only thing — that's not even a

That's just the basis on which they justify making

it a penalty.
QUESTION:

OK.

MR. MANESS:

Well, I started to say, but we do

contend that such laws must be carefully drawn or authorita­
tively construed.

And I want to point out some of the reach

of this ordinance.

It manifests no particular concern for

persons in the privacy of their homes and yards, only persons
in public streets or places.

It does not deal with captive

audiences who cannot escape looking or being bombarded or
who cannot escape being forced to confront a situation.

It

manifests no concern for highway safety or traffic hazards.
It is not concerned with public displays of things depicting

18
explicit sexual activity, and is not related to obscenity or
pornography.

It does not deal with material so grossly

offensive or emotionally disturbing to an unwilling audience
as to be the proper subject of criminal proscription.

It

takes no account of the duration or the context of such
nudity, whether the scenes are from a travelogue, et cetera.
And the ordinance clashes violently, I think, with the long

v

line of cases in this Court which have drawn a distinction
between protected and unprotected speech, the "fighting word"
cases.
What has been said by this Court in the majority and
the dissenting opinions in those cases from Cohen v. California
to Collin v. City of Cincinnati, I think apply to this case
and condemns this ordinance.
For example, the Court said in Cohen v. California,
"The ability of Government to shut off discourse solely to
protect others from tearing it is dependent upon a showing that
substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an
essentially intolerable manner."

This ordinance has not been

so construed.
Wow, even the dissent by Mr. Justice Powell with
whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun joined in
Rosenfeld v. Hew Jersey, if you take those principles and
apply them to this case, this ordinance cannot stand
constitutional muster because it doss nothing and says nothing

19

to inhibit the traditionally unprotected speech.

And on the

other hand, where movies are concerned, it can never be said
that the cheap and the shoddy are no essential part of
exposition of ideas or that such expositions have so slight
social value as to be a step to truth that any benefit that
may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social
interest in order and morality. Though perhaps implied in the
city's brief, in truth the ordinance in question does not
even concern itself with children, littering, or trespassing.
And at least the Florida courts have not so construed it, and
tills Court must take it on its face.
I will save the rest of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Maness.

Mr. Allen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM LEE ALLEN
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
; r. X .

MR. ALLEN;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Sitting with me at the counsel table is Harry

Shorstein, idle general counselof the city.

I am assistant

counsel.
Most of the cases set forth in the Appellant's
brief and the argument made here today would suggest that
what we are dealing with is obscenity.

Our position is tills

particular ordinance deals solely with a public nuisance
which has been long recognised to be the power and the duty

20
of municipalities at common law to abate.
Now, there has been some discussion that the
ordinance doesn’t deal specifically with children; it doesn't
deal specifically with traffic.

Normally ordinances are not

written in a whereas, whereas, whereas form like a resolution.
I think courts know and this Court knows what everyone else
knows, and that is as one drives along the highway one can see
drive-in screens raised up in the air, and if we see something
that catches our eye, we tend to look at it and it could
distract us and cause problems.

I think we know as the trial

judge did in this case that children make up a percentage,
a growing percentage, of the population in this country.
Certainly the ordinance does not purport to regulate obscenity,
only nudity, and I certainly would suggest traffic.

The

willful and intentional exposure of one's private parts has
been a crime at common law.

One of the cases cited in our

brief dealt with some swimmers in a national forest who had
been swimming in the nude and they then decided they wanted
to get them some watermelons and they were

lying up on the

river bank in the nude eating watermelons.

Their conviction

was upheld by the Tenth Circuit, and I think properly so.
Certainly if you cannot prohibit this at a drive-in,
you cannot prohibit it at the Hollywood Bowl or any place
out in the public.

You could not prohibit people walking around

in the nude on public streets —

21
QUESTION:

Well, this ordinance says —> it’s perhaps

not important, but it doesn't apply only to people in the nude?
it applies to the same kind of dress people wear on bathing
beaches, some of it.
MR. ALLEN;

Mr. Justice Stewart, I suggest that

people don’t walk around on bathing beaches most places with
bare female breasts or with bare buttocks showing or with the
pubic areas showing,

No, but they do with some of this other

But I don't really think it is very important.
MR. ALLEN;

Yes.

Some of the bathing suits that are

seen we may reach that point almost, but not quite.
QUESTION;

Well, some bathing suits reach the point

covered by some of this language.
MR. ALLEN;

Yes.

Now, from the Bloss case, which is —

If there were displayed copies of the

Bare breasts are showing and some of these would run afoul.

present in this
QUESTION:

Oh, no?

MR. ALLEN:

Sir?

QUESTION:

Look again.

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, I see a few.

(Laughter. )
QUESTION:

May I ask how your ordinance protects

children standing in an adjacent private yard, adjacent to
the movie theater complex?
MR. ALLEN:
Blackmun.

I think that's our intent, Mr. Justice

As the evidence shows and the record shows, there

are several private streets with private residences, and there
was one lady testifying in the case that she could sit out
on her front porch

and actually watch the movies.

There are

pictures in there before this Court showing the screen.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Yes, but they are not in a public place.
Well, streets have been held to be

public places, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But if she’s in a — it says "visible

from any public street or public place."

So if we have a nude breast or bare buttocks or pubic

area, they are magnified considerably.

I think the example

used in our brief was that of a streaker, which fad has
fizzled out to some extent, but you have a king-size streaker
streaking across the air.

If you can't prohibit this, as we

again indicate, you could put home movies out in your back

dismissed the appeal.

This Court

There again this was a matter of nudity,

which I submit municipalities certainly have not only the right,
but the obligation to maintain.

24
Certainly speaking of drawing an ordinance narrowly
to protect juveniles, it isn't like prior censorship or books
that can be bought at bookstores or films that can be bought.
There is no way — Mr. Maness spoke of this, and he's a
former state circuit judge

there is no way you could draw

an ordinance spelling all this out.

X submit it v?ould be so

long and involved and contradictory in terms, there would just
be no way it could be done.
Now, I might touch on what this Court has said from
?

time to time about these matters.

In the Bnrston case in

which the Court first held freedom of speech applies to
movie theaters, the Court said at page 502,

spoke about protecting juveniles.

The Redrup case

In Stanley v. Georgia

this Court spoke of the danger of juveniles finding things.
Now, the appellant in his brief says, well, most
parents if they are honest will admit that they don't know what
is proper.

Well, that is something that a parent cannot

abdicate his responsibility.

We have conflicting testimony

from various child experts, Dr. Spock and others, and possibly
some of the permissiveness that does emerge creates part of
the problem.

But it is the parents' right, I think -- we are

speaking of constitutional rights — it's his duty to see what

25
his children see and don't see»
I

would like to talk about the Rafos case decided

most recently by this Court, which I think deals with what we
are talking about, and it’s the only opinion of this Court
that I could find dealing with drive-in theaters»

The question

there was the sexual scenes, but the statute did not make it
clear that there would be punishment for showing it at a
drive-in, whereas you would be permitted at the closed type
theater»

But as said by the Chief Justice, joined by Fir.

Rehnquist in separate concurring opinions,

"Public display of

explicit material such as are described in this record are
not significantly different from

any noxious public nuisance

traditionally within the power of the States to regulate and
prohibit, and in ray viex-; involve no significant countervailing
first amendment considerations."

An offensive nuisance.

Certainly it's something that has to be considered,
the weighing of the interest of the public as against the
right of the man showing the movie.

They are not prohibited

from showing nude movies, they are not prohibited from having
consenting adults or others coming in* the only prohibition of
the ordinance is if you are going to show the movie which is
visible fx*om a public street or a public place, then you have
to'' not show a movie which has bare breasts, bare buttocks, or
the bare pubic areas.
Thank you»

MR. ALLEN;

I would suggest that I just cannot

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM II. MANESS
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MANESS;

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice* and may

I realize that we can go to legal

about, this

whereas and the wherefors, and I particularly like Mr. Chief
Justice’ language in Rabe v. Washington where he said*

”X for

one would be unwilling to hold that the first amendment
prevents a State from prohibiting such a public display of
scenes depicting explicit sexual activities if the State

27
undertook to do so under a statute narrowly drawn to protect
the public from such potential exposure."
I don't think we are quarreling with that language
ourselves.

What 1 am saying is the city claims the power to

declare and abate nuisances and that its determination is
conclusive and binding on the courts and if such be so, which
we deny, it is a short step from declaring mere nudity a
public nuisance when exhibited on outdoor movie: screens visible
from a public place regardless of its context, of its presents”
tion, and from there declaring movies with unpopular scenes or
ideas without nudity a public nuisance.

To delete one scene

from any movie without regard to its relation to the rest of
the movie because the City Council brands that scene a public
nuisance is to give the Council the unbridled power of
censorship of ideas and the power to suppress perhaps the one
idea that just might help society solve some of the hang-ups
that inhibit so many people in relationship with others,
particularly between the sexes and among the sexes, and for that
matter rapists.

The City Council does not speak for me when

it determines that a bare human female breast on an outdoor
movie screen is a public nuisance, and it smacks of the male
chauvinism that i think it is.

Women and men can be beautiful,

ugly, good, bad, angels or devils, dressed or undressed, and the
full range of human emotions may be stirred, calmed, excited,
inspired by a variety of events, in all stages of dress and

28
undress.

People are humans, different, funny, sad, good, and

depicting life in movies is and can be educational and
entertaining and even inspirational.

One who denies the

beauty of the human species or its potential for beauty simply
because its form is not draped in clothing

we have devised

for our own creature comforts and to impress others

denies

Godes handiwork and has never strolled the beaches on a hot
summer day.

Do clothes make the woman

or does the woman

make the clothes?
Just as we are free to choose our dress or undress
on the beach, so movie makers and exhibitors on outdoor
screens should not be denied the full range of their
creativity simply because someone may look without paying
or be offended without understanding. The public nuisance
doctrine is inappropriate.

The ordinance is overbroad and

not carefully drawn or authoritatively construed and is not
limited to unprotected speech.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Than]?, you, Mr. Maness.

Thank you,gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the oral argument in
the above “-entitled matter was concluded.)
