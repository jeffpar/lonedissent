PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 73-1231 and consolidated with
73—123-4 , Linden Lumber Division against the Labor Board
and the Labor Board against the Truck Drivers Union.
Mr. Come, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
These cases are here on writ of certiorari to
the District of Columbia Circuit and they present a question which was left open by this Court in the Glssel
Packing case in 395 U.S..
In Gissel, the Court sustained the Board's
authority to acquire an employer to recognize and bargain
with a union that based its claim to represent the status
on the possession of the union authorization cards where
the employer had engaged in independent unfair labor
practices that tended to preclude the holding of a fair
election.
The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether
a bargaining order based on cards or some other showing of
employee support other than a board, election is ever
appropriate in cases where there is no Interference with

4
the election processes.
QUESTION:

You say the Court left that open?

There wasn't any occasion for the Court to object to that
question at all in Glssel, was there?
MR. COME:

Well, the union had urged a broader

position, which is the
QUESTION:

equivalent of the position here.

But it was outside the scope of the

case in controversy then presented to the Court, wasn’t it?
MR. COME:

Yes, that is correct because there,

there were unfair labor practices which tended to preclude
the holding of a fair election.
QUESTION:

And that was the fulcrum of the

MR. COME:

That was the fulcrum of the decision.

decision.

However, we believe that the rationale, the court’s
reasoning is relevant to the problem that we have here that
I will get to in a moment.
There are two broad cases here which were
consolidated for purposes of briefing and argument in the
Court of Appeals on the Board's petition, that is.
'The first in\rolves the Linden Lumber Company,
which manufactures prefabricated homes and the second
involves Wilder Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of
cooking utensils,
The essential facts of both cases are similar and

5
I’ll briefly sketch them out.
In both cases, the union — the Teamsters in
Linden and the Textile Workers in Wilder — obtained signed
authorization cards from a majority of the companies’
employees in a unit later found to be appropriate.

There

were 11 out of 11 plus the card of one employee who was
found to be a supervisor in Linden and 11 out of 18 in
Wilder.
The union requested recognition and, in Linden,
accompanied the request with a petition to the board for
a representation election.
In both cases, the company denied the recognition
request.

In Linden, the company did so and refused to

consent to an election on the union’s petition because of
its belief that supervisors had assisted in the union’s
organizational effoi’t.
The card-signers included Shafer and Marsh, whom
the company contended were supervisors.

A board subsequently

found that Marsh was not a supervisor, that Shafer was
but that his conduct did not taint the union majority.
In Wilder, the company refused recognition
because of its belief the unit was larger than 18,

It was

ultimately found to be an appropriate unit and thus the
union did not have a majority in the larger unit and before
the board, there was a contest as to whether seven

6
technical employees that the company claimed should have
been included in the unit were, in fact, in the unit.
The board resolved that against the company.
In Linden, the union withdrew its representation
petition and in both cases the employees struck and
established picket lines in front of the plant.
In Linden, eight of the 11 card signers partici­
pated in this activity, at least at the outset, and in
Wilder, all of the 11 original card-signers did.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, may I ask a question?

MR. COME:

Yes.

If •—

QUESTION:--either employer in these circumstances
had itself a petition for an election, it would have been
entitled to it?
MR. COME:

They would have been entitled to

QUESTION:

Because I think you took — as I

petition.

remember when Gissel

was here, the board told us that its

view now was that the employer, even in circumstances like
these, itfas entitled to itself, to insist upon an election,
MR. COME:

Yes, but the board also took the

position that the employer was not required to petition for
an election.

That if the employer merely rejected the card

showing with no comment, it would not — he would not be
guilty of a refusal to bargain, that he could file a petition

7
If he wanted to.

The union likewise could file a petition

because In the board’s view3 an election was the most
reliable and the quickest way of resolving the situation.
QUESTION:

And what is the difference in these

situations?
MR. COME:

There Is no

the difference here is

whether or not — at least as I understand the difference
between the parties —- the fact that the employer had
knowledge independent of the cards that was provided by the
picket-line showing, should be enough to make a difference
in the bargaining obligation.
QUESTION:

And the picketing is sort of a

demonstrative election.
MR. COME:

Is that the idea?

It reinforces the card showing.

QUESTION: Now, has that always been the board’s
position?
MR. COME:

No, your Honor, that has not always

been the board’s position.

As when we were here before in

Gissel, we pointed out to the Court that the board’s
position under the Wagner Act was the Joy Silk position and
that was also the position during the early days of TaftHartley.

The Joy Silk position made the ggod faith
the touchstone of the bargaining obligation.
In other words, the union came forward with a

card showing or a card showing plus a picket line showing.

8
The burden was on the employer9

If he rejected

the bargaining request, to come forward with the reasons to
shoxv why he doubted the union majority.
The board, over the years, had great difficulty
in applying the good faith doubt concept because it involved,
in many cases, a probe into the employers' subjective
motivation.
QUESTION:

So that is when the board went to the

idea that, if they wanted to refuse the cards and insist on
an election, whether they filed their own petition or not,
they could do so without committing an unfair labor practices
MR. COME:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, when this changed that

is now — you are now presenting.
MR. COME:

Now, at the time of Gissel we pointed

out that the board had abandoned the Joy Silk doctrine and
had virtually — and as the Court said in Gissel, under the
board’s current practice, an employer's good faith doubt
is largely irrelevant and the key is the commission of
serious unfair labor practices.
Thus an employer can insist on an election with
the no comment.
The Court added, however, that the board had a
qualification of the independent knowledge that if the
employer knew, through a personal poll, for instance, that

9
a majority of his employees supported, the union, that
would make a different result.
Now, what has happened here is that the board,
subsequent to Glssel, has concluded that the independent
knowledge exception is subject to the same problems in it
that led to the abandonment of the good faith doubt prin­
ciple to begin with because how are you to know whether the
employer has independent knowledge?
As the board put it, that would require us to
reenter the thicket of good faith doubt that we told the
Court that we had abandoned in Gissel.
Now, the union says, however, a picket-line
showing is something else.
The board concluded — and the Court of Appeals
agreed with the board — that a picket line showing should
not be entitled to definitive weight because a picket-line
showing is very often the result of a bandwagon psychology.
There may be peer pressures that would induce
it and to find out whether the employees really meant it or
didn’t mean it, you are going to have to. probe subjective
motivation and therefore, the cleanest thing is to adopt a
clear-cut principle that, if an employer keeps his hands
clean and does not commit unfair labor practices which
would interfere with the holding of a fair election, he is
entitled to reject a shotting less than a board election.
Yes.

10

QUESTION;

So the board’s position will be he is

entitled, in the absence of committing unfair labor practice^
he is entitled to an election, if he wants it.
MR. COME;

That is correct.

There is just one

exception to that and that is the Snow and Son situation
where the board says that if the employer waives his right
to an election and agrees to be bound by some other means,
like a poll, he can’t renege on that and say that, well, he
still wants an election.
QUESTION;

Well, I take it you are also forced,

along that line, to say that not only is the employer
entitled to an election, but he needn’t file the petition.
If you made him file the petition, you'd be
immediately back in trying to find out when it is he has to
file the petition.
MR. COME:

That is correct, and that is the

difference between the board and the Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals goes with the board in
cutting loose from the independent knowledge vestige of the
Joy Silk history.
But the Court of Appeals says that if you are
going to do that, you have got to put something else in
its place.
QUESTION:

To show good faith, yes.

MR. COME:

To show good faith.

11
QUESTION:

By filing a petition.

MR. COME:

By having the employer file his own

petition or express a willingness to consent to a petition —
QUESTION:

But that would mean getting back again

to figuring out when it is he has to file a petition.
MR. COME;

That is right, your Honor and it is

for that reason that the board believes that the Court of
Appeals exceeded its reviewing authority here in mandating
that the board had to adopt that — well, they put the
board on the horns of a dilemma.
They either had to go back to the independent
knowledge concept which the Court recognized was unreliable
and had problems.

Or go to the other extreme of requiring

that the employer file a petition if he wants to get out
from under a bargaining obligation.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Come, there really isn't

much trouble in determining when there is a card majority
on the face of things, anyway.
MR. COME:

No —

QUESTION:

And if you

said, well, there is a

card majority, the employer ought to at least file the
petition rather than sit and wait.
Now, what is so difficult about that?
MR. COME:
doesn't require it.

Well, ure believe that the statute
I mean, conceivably the board could

12
go to that position, but t^e believe that this is an area
that Congress left to the board to determine what is going to
be the proper accommodation here.
QUESTION:
issue, though?

Mine C ~~

But what about on the merits of the

Is it just a litigation avoidance rationale

or what?
MR. COME:

Well, I think that ~

QUESTION:

I mean, it doesn’t appear on the face

of it to be a whole lot of merit in saying that an employer
who is faced xsrith a card majority plus a picket line by a
majority of the bargaining unit can just shrug it off and
not even file a petition.
There must be some reason the board has for
saying he can sit and x;ait.
MR. COME:

Well, I think the reason is that the --

first of all, the —- in adding Section 9C 1(b) to the
statute in ’47, which is the provision that gives the
employer the right to file a petition, there is no
indication that Congress even intended that the employer
would have to file a petition to resolve his doubts.
The sole purpose for adding that provision was to
cure what was the discrimination that existed against the
employer under the board’s Wagner Act rules; under the rules
that the board worked out under the Wagner Act, a union
could file a petition but an employer could only

file a

13
petition if he was presented by rival claims and so that„
in a one-union situation such as we have here, he couldn’t
have filed one even if he wanted to and the legislative
history indicates that that was the sole reason that the
employer was given the privilege of filing a petition.
It doesn’t say that he has to file one and that
if he doesn’t, that he would be subject
obligation under 8A(5).
QUESTION:

to a bargaining

Nov; —■

Well, you are suggesting, nevertheless,

that the board might not, for reasons dealing with the
general administration of the act, conclude that no, he
must file one.

Merely because the statute doesn’t say so

in so many words doesn’t mean that the board is powerless
to declare it, does it?
MR. COME:

I do not think that the board would

be precluded from doing so.
QUESTION:

It did.

However ~~
He already

— you have

gone farther than that in the past.
MR. COME:

Well, I think — I think that the

board was reasonable and —
QUESTION:

In the bargain, there was an unfair

labor practice.
MR. COME:

Well ~

QUESTION:

If he didn’t bargain, he was guilty of

an unfair labor practice under Joy Silk, if there was a

14
card majority or independent knowledge.
MR. COME:

That was under the Joy Silk rule.

But

having eliminated the Joy Silk rule , we submit that it is
reasonable for the board to go the whole hog and say that
we are not going to get into the question of good faith or
lack of good faith.
The filing of the petition does bear on good
faith.

I mean, the union is perfectly free to file a peti­

tion if it wants an election, no less than the employer.
If the union were to file the petition, the union
ttfould have to define the unit and it would also have to
make a 30 percent showing.
QUESTION:

If the employer —

Mr. Come, is that the mechanical

difference between the employer filing the petition and the
union doing so?
MR. COME:

I believe that it is, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Is that the only difference?

MR. COME:

I believe that is so.

It also accounts

for the timing of the election and the length or period of
time in which the employer may have the right to exercise
his power under 8(c) of the statute to indicate why he
believes the employees may not want a union, which has
become a very important element that was added to the
statute in 19^7 when Congress amended section VII of the
act to give employees the right to refrain from union

15
activity no less than the right to engage in union activity
QUESTION:

What was the board doctrine in 1947?

Weren't you requiring bargaining by employers
I thought that was --

without an election?
MR. COME:

Yes.

They did legislate against that back-

Or was it —
MR. COME:

No.

QUESTION:

MR. COME:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Under what circumstances, Mr. Come,

is the union — or the employees ever compelled to file
petition for an action?
MR. COME:

Under what circumstances is the union

16
ever compelled?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. COME:

I think that —

QUESTION:

Have the right to —

MR. COME:

They have the right — there is no

compunction to file.

The only sense in which there might

be compulsion is that in 1959 Congress added 8(b)7(c) to the
statute which regulates picketing for recognition and that
says that you can picket for recognition for 30 days unless
a petition for an election is filed within that period of
time and if the union is picketing for recognitions if it
wants to continue its picketing beyond 30 days, that might
furnish some compulsion to file a petition, but there isn’t
any other
QUESTION:

Another way of saying this Is that they

can’t continue the picketing for more than 30 days, if they
do 2iot file a petition.
MR. COME:

That is —

QUESTION:

Isn’t that the thrust of the act?

MR COME:

That Is correct, your Honor.

Now, the board —• yes?
QUESTION:

Let me put it another way.

the union always want the employer to petition?

Why does
What does

It gain by having the employer petition in contrast to
itself?

Just the designation of the unit?

17
MR. COME:

I think that that is so.

They also

believe that If the employer petitions, It is going to be
faster because it is much — there is much less likelihood
of litigation.
Nowj we submit that that is not entirely valid
because even if the employer were to petition, unless he
were willing to consent to a hearing, that would not speed
things up any because an employer petition would not
preclude the employer from litigating unit questions.
For example, in the Milder case, there was a
question of whether the seven technicals were included in
the unit or not.
Now, even if the employer were forced to file
a petition, it is most unlikely that he would have waived
his right to go to a hearing on that question because that
could well make a difference in the union's majority.
Similarly, in Linden, there was a question of
supervisory assistance in the union's organizational drive.
An employer petition would not have cut out litigation
of that point.
So we submit that the assumption of the Court of
Appeals, that an employer petition would invariably speed
things up, would not, we submit, preclude an employer who
has either a legitimate or an illegitimate basis for
seeking to litigate issues still continuing to litigate.

18
So with that in mind, the board concluded that
there is no warrant for distorting the scheme of the statute
and then requiring an employer petition.
QUESTION:

You indicated earlier that the board

tends to discount the pressures of picketing for recognition
because of the bandwagon aspect.

Do you think there is any

less or more bandwagon aspect to card signing?
MR. COME:

I would say that there is certainly

likely to be as much.
QUESTION:

At least as much, would it not?

MR. COME:

At least as much.

QUESTION:

The documentary aspect of it is very,

very forceful psychologically, isn't it?
Had the board ever Indicated that in any affirma­
tive way?
MR. COME:

Well, I think I — I think they have

indicated it in their statements that an election is a more
reliable means of ascertaining, yes.
QUESTION:

Because it is a secret ballot.

MR. COME:

That is correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And the bandwagon aspect of either

crowding people Into a picket line or pressing cards on them
isn't present in the balloting.
MR. COME:

And the picket line has the added

problem, since 8(b)7 has been added to the statute in '59.

19
If that made the difference, if cards

alone were

not enough5 but a picket line was, you would be encouraging
picketing for recognition contrary to the policy of 8(b)(7)»
which is to restrict such picketing., at least, and to
funnel these things into the board's election processes.
I believe I have already trespassed on my
brother's time, so —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Come.

Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF LINDEN LUMBER DIVISION
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We agree with the Labor Board that where an
employer does not commit unfair labor practices and preclude
a fair election, a bargaining order based oh either cards
or picket lines or both or other secondary indicia of
employers’ employee support should not issue.
At the heart of this issue, as the Court of
Appeals noted, is really a fundamental disagreement as to
the direction and policy of our National Labor Act.
Let me try and summarize what I believe the
union’s position is.
This is thusly.
The unions argue not only to cause or picket

20
lines should be an interchangeable substitute with election,
but actually, they should be preferred to election.
The unions argue that the policy of our Labor
Act, at the time of the Wagner Act, has remained unchanged,
that it is to promote unionization, that elections, since
they take longer, since unions lose more elections than they
do in the case of obtaining cards, should not be used unless
there is a bonafide dispute as to whether the cards or the
picket lines evidence employee support.
Where there is a bona fide dispute, then there
should be an election.
Where there is no bona fide dispute, then the
card3 or the secondary indicia should speak for themselves.
We disagree with this position.

We think it is

contrary to the intent of the Taft-Hartley Amendments to the
act.
We think it is contrary to this Court's reasoning
and the logic of its opinion in the Gissel case.
At least since 19^7, the board has never — now, I
emphasize never — held that cards or picket line activity,
in and of itself, where there is no unfair labor practices,
is the basis for a bargaining order.
Since the Taft-Hartley Amendments were added to
the act, the policy of the act has been, not to promote
unionization but to promote free, reasoned, informed

21
employee choice.
That was the entire thrust of the Taft-Hartley
Amendments to the act and election, as we thought this
Court made clear in Gissel, is the preferred means, not
other means.

And other means are only to be used where, in

the language of the Franks grothers case, to prevent an
employer from profiting by his own wrongdoing, or where an
election is not possible because the employer has precluded
it by his unfair labor practice.
Where an election is possible, where a free
election is possible, then that ought to be the course that
is used.
There are many indications, we think, of this
Congressional intent and the change in the direction of
the act at the time of Taft-Hartley.
First of all — and the real thrust of the lav;
which now, as this Court stated last term in the Surveyor
t oward
case, is one of neutrality / collective bargaining, not
promotion of collective bargaining.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, this argument suggests

that Joy Silk was wrongly decided by the Court.
MR. COHEN:

No, I think that Joy

the question

really is, in Joy Silk, there were unfair labor practices.
The question that is really before the Court is
a gloss on the Joy Silk doctrine in the sense of whether.

22

where there are no unfair labor practicess standing alone,
the so-called Snow and Sons "independent knowlege question."
In Joy Silk there were unfair labor practices and
the board at all times after 19^7, with the exception of the
renege-type situation that Mr. — which was actually Snow
and Sons that Mr. Come alluded to, except for that kind of
renege exception, the board uniformly did never issue
bargaining orders where there was no unfair labor practices.
That was Secretary of Labor Wertz;' position x^hen
he testified during the amendments to the Act.

That was the

position that the board expressly stated in 1966 in the
Aaron Brothers case that this

Court referred to in Gissel

and has been in, as far as we have been able to research in
every other commentator, the uniform position of the board.
In fact, one commentator cited in our brief said
no board member has even suggested going as far as the
unions xtfould propose at any time since 19^7.
So in our

opinion, there is no change in

direction of the board policy in this case.

There is merely

a reaffirmation of what has been longstanding board policy
required by the Congressional intent manifested in TaftHartley.
Taft-Hartley added, for example. Section 9(c)(1)(b)
to the act.

This provision, as this Court stated in

Gissel, fully supports the board's present administration of

23
the act, for an employer can insist on a secret ballot
election unless, In the words of the board, he engages In
contemporaneous unfair labor practices likely to destroy
the union’s majority and Impede the election.
So 9(c)(1)(b) does riot, as the unions argue here,
detract from the board’s policy.

Nor, as the Court of

Appeals argues, should it Impose an independent requirement
It supports the board's policy.
The employer has an option.

He can let the

union file a petition and do nothing or he can, if he
wishes, go in and file his own petition.
There was an additional Taft-Hartley Section 8(c)
added to the act.

It is the purpose of Section 8(c), we

submit, is to permit an employer to articulate his views
on the reasons why employees

should not choose unions.

It was to inform employees and permit them to
consider the question in the light of an election with the
knowledge of both sides.
There was also the express right added in TaftHartley that employees may refrain from unionisation, that
unions cannot interfere with that policy.
Taft-Hartley, as well as the Lander and Griffin
amendments to the act curtailed recognition picketing,
secondary boycotts, the use of union power to try and
obtain recognition and there was also the requirement added

that certification could only issue in the case of an
election and decertifications and so on, as we spelled out
in our brief.
Tlie thrust of all these changes xfas not to promote
and continue to promote unionisations but to instead direct
the act of the employee free choice.
It was to channel claims for recognition into the
election area., unless there was either voluntary recognition
or unless the employer precluded the use of the election
machinery.
Since Taft-Hartley3 as I indicated, the boys
repeatedly recognised this principle.
Excuse me.
QUESTION:

You mean, as interfering with it?

MR. COHEN:

Yes.

QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Yes.

The unfair labor — Two alternatives, that the employer

voluntarily recognizes the union and either conditionally
says it is subject to a third-party check of your cards or
he does it without any petition.

Then, of course, there is

no election.
If he interferes with the election, as Gissel
made clear, by substantial unfair labor practices so that
there can be no fair election, then, of course, the election
machinery can't be used against him.

25
QUESTION:

But the interference, in that sense,

is an affirmative act, is it not?
MR. COHEN:

It is an affirmative act of the

employer that requires resort to secondary evidence
because the primary evidence of the election is not
available and I think this points out another anomaly of
the union’s position.
If, as this Court said .in Gissel, where you have
minimal interference with an election, no bargaining order
should issue, then how can you have a bargaining order in
a case such as this where there Is no interference whatso­
ever with the election process.
That is where we think this case and the union’s
position is, if not required by the express language of
Gissel, because the questions reserved there are required
by the logic of Gissel.
Let roe turn, if I may, to the position of the
Court of Appeals and why we think that is really an
incorrect compromise, if you will, between the different
positions.
Contrary to Mr. Come, we would take the position
that the board has no power, even if it wanted to, which it
did not, to require an employer to file an election petition.
That would impose an obligation not required by
the act, 9C(l)(b) permits but does not require an employer

26
election petition.
In f‘acts that Idea was suggested at the time of
the Taft-Hartley Amendment and rejected.

To quote a couple

of sentences from a Fourth Circuit decision in Logan Packings
"It was made plain in the Taft-Hartley Committee reports
that an employer, after receipt of a demand to bargain from
a union claiming to represent a majority of employees need
not petition for an election.

He had the alternative of

waiting for the union to invoke the board's election process,
but he was assured of an election on his own petition that
the union sought to obtain recognition by a means other
than election.
The second defect in the Court of Appeals'
position, as Mr. Come has pointed out, is that it resurrects
the good faith doubt.
When should an employer have to petition?

Well,

he should have to petition it evidences good faith, says the
Court of Appeals.
That returns one to the xvhole Joy Silk subjective
intent quagmire.
good faith.

There is no way to ascertain subjective

There is no need to obtain subjective good

faith.
We think, third, that what the Court of Appeals
has done is —
QUESTION:

Earlier, Mr. Cohen, I thought you

27
suggested that the board couldn't return the good faith
test.
MR. COHEN:

We said that the board — no, what we

have suggested is that the board could not require an
employer to file an election petition.
QUESTION:

That wasn't what I suggested.

Your earlier argument was that, after the 47
amendments, election period and the absence of unfair
labor practice.

Right?

MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

That's our position.
That is the way you have to read the

statute.
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

That's what we would do.
If that is so, in an instance where

there were no unfair labor practices, the board, as a
matter of statutory construction, I thought you were
suggesting, could not return Joy Silk.
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Is that right?

Yes, that’s correct.
To the good faith test.
That is correct.

I think there is --

all I was trying to point out, Mr. Justice Brennan, was
that there were sound policy reasons for the board not
doing so.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the policy reasons

28
would be somewhat similar to the reasons why you would
consider that the board had no authority to force the union
to demand an election»
MR. COHEN:
the act requires

That’s correct.

I mean, I don’t think

either party to petition for an election»

I think that is demonstrated by the 8(b)7 section that
Mr. Come alluded to.
8(b) 7 permits recognition picketing to go on unless
either party files a petition.

Now, if the Court of

Appeals is right that the employer has to file a petition,
that option is lost.

The employer can't simply sit back

and let the union engage in recognition picketing and do
nothing.
He is required to go in and file a petition which
automatically removes the time bar, the 30-day period in
Section 8(b)7(c).

It is inconsistent to say, on one hand,

an employer can sit back and let the union picket for 30
days and then it is over If a petition has not been filed.
And, second, then say the employer must go in and
file a petition which, in effect, removes the 30-day time
bar.
To answer Mr. Justice Blackrnun’s question, why do
union's want employers, let's say, to file a petition?
Well, first of all, It removes the 30 percent
interest showing.

The employer files a petition.

The union

29
doesn’t have to have any interest showing and the result is
that, at that point, the election is held.

The union could

win the election without ever having to establish the 39
percent requirement that it would have to do if it filed
its own petition.
It enables, secondly, a union to control the
timing and the duration.

Unions frequently demand recog­

nition and propose at the peak of their organizational
campaign so that if an employer is required to file as soon
as the union demands recognition, there is no time hiatus
between the filing of the petition and the union’s demand
for recognition.

And any possibility that the employer in

that period can engage in campaigning.
Unions traditionally want to speed up the election
process because, as soon after they have organized as
possible, they would like the election.
Employers traditionally take the opposite point
of view.

The more time that elapses, the more opportunity

employees have to hear the other side, the better the
chance of employer’s success and the less chance that the
unions are going to win the election.
So the thrust of the Court of Appeals argument
is that this supposedly would avoid delay.
Well, it doesn't do so because if the employer
files a netition, the union can say, we don’t want that unit

30

and the board will then dismiss the petition.
The unions may still say, well, we are willing to
take that unit but vie have some disagreement over the
composition of the voting unit.
Again, what would happen in that case is there is
a hearing required and the hearing would be the same kind
of hearing with the same four processes as would take place
in the case of an employer petition.
So the problem with an employer-required petition
is, first, it is not required by the act.

Contrary to the

committee report it doesn't avoid delay and it is unfair to
employers.
And for all these reasons, vie get back to the
basic principle which we have arp;ued to this Court, that
unless there are unfair labor practices, one should look to
the primary function of an election, the whole thrust of
the act, to resolve the question, do employees want or don't
want a union and looking to their primary thrust, it is
only when the employer has precluded it that the union should
not have to test its claim in the crucible of an election.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, along that line, I still am

a little unclear as to what your position is with respect
to the state of the law at the time of the '47 act.
You say in your brief, "To be sure —" at page 12 —
"To be sure, prior to Gissel, where an employer did not

31
have*a good faith doubt as to the union majority status' or
there did not exist a 'bona fide dispute' ...... a bargain­
ing order could issue."
MR. COHEN:

I think there were some cases prior

to Taft-Hartley, the Dahlstrom case and other cases the
union talks about, where they imply that a bargaining order
could issue if there were no unfair labor practices.
QUESITON:

Well, you said awhile ago that there

has never been an instant —
MR. COHEN:

Since 1947.

Since 1947, was my

position that there has been no —
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Well,

were there before?

There was no — there were cases

which had the language but there were no cases in which the
board imposed such an order.
QUESTION:

But somebody asked — if someone

knowledgeable in labor law was asked could a bargaining
order issue, absent a good faith doubt and absent unfair
labor practices, you'd say yes.
MR. COHEN:

We're talking about the time of

Taft-Hartley?
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Yes.
I think that one would look to cases

that say probably yes, but we don't know.

Well, then —

MR. COHEN:

I don't think there is any board ease

that can —
QUESTION:

Do you think the Taft-Hartley Act —

that, after Taft-Hartley you would answer no?

MR. COHEN:

I think there was

33
some confusion in the board case that was unfortunate,
QUESTION:

Really, Mr. Cohen,

all that you need

to argue here is that the board's present position is a
perfectly permissible one under the existing statute.

MR. COHEN:

Isn't it?
That is correct, sir.

I think it is

the only permissible one but I don't have to go —
QUESTION:

You don’t need to argue.

It is the

only required one.
MR. COHEN:

I don’t have to argue that.

QUESTION: You just say it is perfectly permissible
under the statute and your opponent has to say, no, it Is
not even permissible.
MR. COHEN:

Their position is required.
That is correct.

I would agree with

you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, let me read you just one

sentence of the Court of Appeals opinion and see what your
reaction is to that.
The statement is, "When an employer petitions for
or consents to an election, the election process is
expedited.

If he declines to exercise this option, he

must take the risk that his conduct is a whole in the
context of convincing evidence of majority support may be
taken as a refusal to bargain."

34
Would you say that is the heart of the error of
the Court of Appeals' opinion?
MR. COHEN:
is the error.

I think the second part of the sentence

I think the first part factually, in most

cases, is not correct.
It would not expedite the election process.

I

think there is no reason, based on the arguments I have
given, that it should ever be taken as evidence that we
have faith or evidence to support a bargaining order.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gold.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNIONS
MR. GOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may It please

the Court:
I'd like to pursue the inquiry that it seemed to
me that Mr, Justice White opened, which Is the question,
and that inquiry is, what are the specific statutory
materials that are relevant here?
It is our view that, in accord with normal
practice, we should start with the language of the act,
the language set out, among onter places, on page 2 of our
brief and what the language does is make it an unfair labor
practice for an employer — and I quote — to refuse to
bargain collectively with the representative designated or
selected by the majority of the employees in an appropriate

35
unit.
The only open-ended words there are designated
or

selective and it is perfectly plain that those words

are not the equivalent of certified and yet the board* in
our view* has, in effect, changed those words -— even though
Congress refused to do so in 19^7 — to make them read
"certified."
We think that this language

says — and says

quite clearly on its face — that if the union secures the
status of majority representatives, which is secured by
being designated or selected, the employer has an obligation
at that point, a duty to recognise.
The board says no, he has a privilege, the
privilege to require the union to petition for and secure
a certification.
That privilege is subject to certain conditions
subsequent.

It can be lost if the employer commits unfair

labor practices or it can be lost if he voluntarily agrees
to some test of the union’s majority.

conditions.

It is an absolute privilege subject to those
There is no duty —

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, isn’t this an argument

you didn’t cross-petition here?
MR. GOLD:

No.

QUESTION:

Doesn’t this go beyond what the Court

36
of Appeals did?
In fact, we tried —

MR. GOLD:

No, your Honor.

QUESTION:

You are supporting the Court of Appeals

judgment, aren’t you?
MR. GOLD:

We are supporting the Court of Appeals

judgment, understanding what the Court of Appeals’ judgment
is —- or our understanding of what the Court of Appeals
j udgment is.
Let me digress to try

to reach the point of what

was the Court of Appeals’ judgment.
The Court of Appeals’ opinion on page 35 of the
•V

Ip-a

■

NLLB’s petition — the two petitions here --states the
board’s view of the law.

It says, "The board has adopted a

voluntarist view of the duty to bargain which is that,
absent unfair labor practices or an agreement to determine
majority status through means other than an election, such
as a poll, the employer has no duty to' recognize the union."
That is the board’s absolute privilege position.

Then on pages 36 through 37, the Court of Appeals
says, "We reject that absolute privilege position because it
is contrary to the statute."
The paragraph on the bottom of page 37 says,
"These statutory provisions plainly contemplate employer
duty of recognition, even in the absence of election and
give a safeguard to the employer who has doubts about

37
majority status by assuring him the right to file his own
petition for an election.
There is no clear-cut answer, however, either in
the text of the statute or the legislative history, to the
question of when and in what circumstances, an employer
must take evidence of the majority support as convincing.
So there are two questions.
One, is the board right in saying that an
employer never has a duty to bargain with the union?

That

he has an absolute privilege.
The Court of Appeals answered that question, no.
The next logical question is, under what cir­
cumstances does the employer have a duty?
The Court of Appeals did not answer that question.
It did not enter a bargaining order here and from pages 38
through 50 of the petition appended, it discussed the
question of possible rules that the board could adopt as
long as it recognized the one limitation very clear on the
statute, that it couldn’t require the union to petition for
certification in every case no matter what its showing had
been.
QUESTION:

You don’t think the Court of Appeals

said as long as the employer files, he can escape an unfair
labor practice charge?
MR. GOLD:

I think the Court of Appeals said that

33
it would validate such a rule if the board adopted it, but it
did not say that the board had to adopt it.
QUESTION:

Then let's assume that the board did

adopt a rule that absent other unfair labor practices, absent
agreement, there is no duty to bargain as long as the —
until and unless there is a certification after an employer
requested election.
Now, the Court of Appeals would accept that,
wouldn’t It?
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You would not?

MR. GOLD:

Right.

QUESTION:

You would not.

MR. GOLD:

We would not accept that.

QUESTION:

Then, in that sense, you are saying

that you are disagreeing with the Court of Appeals.
MR. GOLD:
part, that it would.

Well, the Court of Appeals said, in
But in this —- let me say, in this

case there were no employer petitions.
No employer filed a petition, so that question of
the effect of an employer petition isn’t in this case.

It

is an intellectual problem that has to be faced, we think,
but it isn't in this ca e.
The order of the Court of Appeals was simply that
the board was wrong in saying that an employer never had a

39
duty and the order was to remand and then it remanded.
QUESTION:

I am surprised you didn't cross­

petition on this, Mr. Gold.
MR. GOLD:

Well, our view on why we — quite

frankly, we did not cross-petition so that we could find
out the answer to the underlying question before we got to
what we regarded was secondary question, the secondary
question being, under what circumstances an employer has a
duty?
We thought it best to deal with the board’s flat
position, never, at this point and leave it to the board
to deal xtfith that which it can deal with because it is our
view that this question which is here is one that the
statute answers, but it is our view that there are options
open to the board in answering the secondary question
when, if ever —I mean, when does the employer have the
duty to recognize the exact circumstance?
In other xfords, there are a variety — even though
it isn’t clearly acknowledged yet — there are a variety
of ways the union can prove its majority.
One would be through cards.
Another would be, as in this case through cards
plus a strike by the card-signers.
Another would be by giving the employer cards and
offering to have him check it through a poll conducted

40
pursuant to safeguards.
We may get different answers to those.

We think

the board has a degree of leeway in answering the question
of what is the specific — what are the specifics of when
the employer’s duty arises.
The one thing we do not think the board can do is
to say that the employer never has a duty, that no matter
what the union does in proving its majority, and no matter
hoxv inactive the employer is, if you will, in reacting to
that, that it is never an unfair labor practice for him to
refuse to bargain.
QUESTION:

Well, aren’t you converting an option

into an obligation by this argument that you are making?
An option that has been extended to an employer, as it is
extended to the workmen, to call for an election.
Now you are converting that into an obligation.
In fact, the Court of Appeals has done so, have they not?
MR. GOLD:

Well, first of all, in practical terms,

the union doesn’t have an option.

The whole reason that

there is a National Labor Relations Act is that employers
have normally not chosen to deal, of their own free
volition, with unions.
But the question is, when does the employer have a
duty to deal with the
QUESTION:

union?
I am. speaking in terms of the option,

the option to seek an election.
These other alternatives are all a series of
things leading up to the same end result.

We'd all agree

on that.
MR. GOLD:

Well, we don't agree with that.

QUESTION:

And if they are not exercised, up to

now has it not been thought clear that the union has an
option at its choice to call for an election and that the
employer has an option to call for an election and that
neither one is compelled to do so.
Is that not so?
MR. GOLD:

Well, I don't think that it has ever

been the law that an employer has an option — it has never
been the law,so far as I knov/, that an employer has an
option no matter what the circumstances, to call for an
election.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't Gissel, the holding of

the court in Gissel, regarded as a departure in the sense
that it said that the option of the employer is lost in
circumstances where the employer has done something to
interfere with the probability of a free choice?
Isn't that the essence of the Gissel holding?
MR. GOLD:

Well, that is the essence of the

Gissel holding, but it is not a departure, as we understand
it, from anything that was the law starting with the day

42
after the Wagner Act was passed,
QUESTION:

You didn’t think Gissel — the Gissel

holding startled anyone?
MR. GOLD:

Not in terms of the obligations it

imposed on employers.
It has been understood since the first day of the
Wagner Act., because of the plain language of the Wagner Act,
that employers have a duty to bargain and there has never
been, as I attempt to show -—
QUESTION:

Bargain on what?

MR. GOLD:

I'm sorry.

On everything?

It has, as the language of

the statute shows, they have a duty to bargain with the
representative designated or selected by the"majority.

That

has been the lav; and from 1935 until 194,73 as Mr. Come
forthrightly stated, it was perfectly well-settled that the
employer had an oblip^ation to bargain with the union when
the union presented convincing evidence of majority support,
that he could not insist that the union petition for an
election and, indeed, it was perfectly well-settled, prior
to 1935, that he had no right, the employer had no right
under any circumstances, to petition for an election when
there is only one union in the picture.
That was the law.
Nov;, to get back to the language of the statute,
the language of the statute imposes a duty on the employer

to bargain with the union which has the status of having
been designated or selected by the majority.
Congress did not, in 1935, use the word that the
employer only had a duty to bargain with the union which
had been certified.
Now, let me talk about the precedents from 1935
to 19^7.

Early on in the act, Judge

Learned Hand, in the

REmington-Rand case, which is cited on pages 9 and 10 of
our brief, said that the employer was not completely at
the mercy of the union.

The union could not come in and

say, we represent a majority.
The employer would say, show me some evidence of
that.
The union would say, we don’t choose to show
any evidence.

In fact, we represent a majority.

choose to show you any evidence.

you

We don't

We are going to file an

8(a)(5) charge against you and prove it at the hearing.
Judge Hand said that it is permissible to look
at the statute as requiring the union to come up with some
evidence and, on the other hand, if he does not, the
employer could say that he has a good faith doubt, since
the union hasn't shown him anything to back up its claim.
And on the other hand, Judge Hand made it per­
fectly plain that the employer — that because of this
option for the employer, it does not mean that the employer,

44
no matter what the facts are, can say, the only thing vre
will accept is a certification.
He says, it does not follow from that immunity —
the immunity based on good faith — it does not follow from
that immunity that the employer need be satisfied with no
evidence except the board certificate.
Later on, in Dahlstrom Metallic Door, which is
cited at pages 6 and 7 of our brief, a case in which there
xtfere no employer unfair labor practices. Judge Charles Clark,
also Second Circuit, said the contention that bargaining
was not mandatory until the board had accredited Local 307
as bargaining agent, is frivolous.
An employer is under a duty to bargain as soon as
the union representative presents convincing evidence of
majority support.

We have cited other board cases as well.

I don’t know how lax? could be more clearly
settled that an employer does not have ----- that prior to
1935, an employer did not have — prior to 1947 — an
employer did not

have the option to say to a union, no

matter what evidence you show me, the only thing that will
satisfy me is the certificate or, in practical fc©rms to
say the same thing by saying I will not bargain with you.
You can go to the Labor Board.
you want.

You can do whatever

I am not going to bargain with you.
I think that that was a thoroughly discredited

45
view,

I know of not a single case prior to 1947 xtfhich can

be cited to support the proposition that an employer has
such an option, and yet that is what the board would give
to an employer today.
Then, in 1947, the Taft-Hartley Amendments were
passed and Congress specifically addressed itself to the
question of whether Section 8(a)(5) and 9(a) should remain
as they were.
The House, which by and large took the position
which was less favorable to unions and more favorable to
employers than the Senate, passed a bill which said that an
employer who had failed to bargain with the union currently
recognized by the employer or certified as such through an
election under Section 9* was the only one who was guilty
of a Section 8(a)(5).
The practical effect of that would have been to
repeal the law as it had been understood.
The Senate would not accept that provision.

The

Senate insisted that Section 8(a)(5) and 9(a) stay as they
were.

The only change was that Section 8, what had previous­

ly been Section 8(5) became Section 8(a)(5) because of
the addition of the 8(b) section creating union unfair
labor practices.
QUESTION:
ment was?

What did you say the proposed amend­

H5
MR. GOLD:

The proposed amendment is reproduced

on page 15 of our brief, the rust-colored brief and the
House proposed to amend Section 8(a)(5) and 9(a) which, as
I have indicated., together impose a duty to represent the —
I mean, to recognize the representative designated or
selected with an obligation imposed on employers who fail
to bargain with a union currently recognized by that
employer or certified as such through an election under
Section 9.
So the employer would have been free of the duty
as it had been understood.

His only duty would be to

recognize a union that had been certified.
QUESTION:

Or one already there.

MR. GOLD:

Or one that had already been

recognized.
In the House Conference report — and this is the
House Conference report I am talking about, now, which,
again, is reproduced on page 15 and I emphasize the words
"House Conference report" because the printed document which
came out of conferences at that time was prepared by the
House managers and signed only by them.
Therefore, simply because of human nature and
nothing else, it had to be taken with somewhat of a grain
of salt where the House receded and there is an indication
in the House Conference report that they really had not

47
given up as much as would appear.
On the other hand* it seems to us to be terribly
persuasive when the House says that we have gone along
absolutely with the Senate view and this is what the House
Conference report says.
The conference agreement follows the provisions
of the existing law in the case of Section 8(5), which
makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse
to bargain collectively with the representative of his
employees subject to the provisions of Section 9(a).
Now, if that isn’t a Congressional ratification
of at least the broad outlines of the law as it stood
before and, as I said, the law as it stood before was
whether or not an employer committed unfair labor practices
If the union presented him with convincing
evidence, he had an obligation, some obligation.

The

term "what was convincing evidence" xfasn’t fleshed out.
That is why we say that that question is open to
the board on remand but the essence, the objective essence
of the good faith standard seems to us to have been quite
clearly ratified by Congress.
I would just like to add one citation to what is
QUESTION:

You wouldn't think that would be

satisfied by a rule that the employer could always refuse
to bargain as long as he sought an election?

ii 3

MR. GOLD:

Mo, our view, Mr. Justice White, is

that, once again, the statute addresses itself directly to
that question.
The Senate had inserted a provision, Section
9(c)(1)(b) giving employers an option to file petition and
in the Senate report

it explained what it was intent upon

and we have reproduced the

relevant portion of that

explanation on page 17 and it said the present board rules
which — and I interject here — which allow the employers
to petition for an election only where two unions were
seeking representative status, discriminate against employers
who have reasonable grounds for believing that labor
organizations claiming to represent the employee are really
not the choice of the majority.
And our view of what Section 9(c)(1)(b) was
intended to do was to deal with the situation that the pre19^7 law didn’t really deal with and that situation is the
following:
The union appears on the scene.
represent a majority of your employees.

It says we
The employer says,

give us some proof and again, the union say's, we will not
give you some proof but vie are going to engage in outsider
picketing or minority picketing, which was lawful then.
The employer says, well, I will recognize you if
you could prove up your majority.

^9
In that type of a situation, the employer could
not get to the door.
And we think Section 9(c)(1)(h) says that if he
has a reasonable doubt, if the union hasn’t fulfilled its
obligation of coming forward with convincing evidence, if
the employer has fulfilled his affirmative obligations as
the law was prior to 194? to investigate the situation and
determine whether or not the union really had convincing
evidence, then the employer could file his petition.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, you have referred to the

law between 1935 and 194? to the Dahlstrom case which
enforced a board order, I believe.
Is it

your position that the board couldn’t

have taken any other position than it did in view of the
statute between 1935 and 1947?
MR. GOLD:

I don’t see how the board could have

taken another view.

But I do think that if the board had

taken another view between 1935 and 1947 and if we had the
same sequence of events and a 1947 determination by the
Conference Committee to follow the lav; as it stood, that
that might stand up now.
At least you would have a conflict in that
situation between the plain language of the act and the
legislative history in ’47.
What I am arguing for here is a rule which says

50
that the act states an obligation on the employer that that
obligation was understood and given meaning between 1935
and 1947 and the board cannot write that obligation out of
the law and substitute for it a privilege.
QUESTION:

Do you think Congress froze it then*

MR. GOLD:

To that extent.

To the extent of the

We have been careful in our brief to say that we

do not think that the *35 to '47 law answers the question
what is convincing evidence?

What are the circumstances

under which an employer must bargain?
That is why we didn’t cross-petition.

That is

why we think that that question is properly for the board
in the first instance.
QUESTION:

They have never addressed it.

Mr. Gold, if the board were to address

it and were to say nothing is convincing except the result
of an election.
MR. GOLD:

That, we think, is the one option which

That was the one thing that was frozen into

the law.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. GOLD:

We don’t see how, in light of the 335 to

QUESTION:

So, whatever the definition of

’4 7 law —

convincing evidence that the board used to suggest a fashion,

51
they can include that.
MR. GOLD:

That's right.

QUESTION:

Well, there has got to be some other

types of convincing evidence.
MR. GOLD:

That is right.

We think that —

in

other words, If the House had prevailed, it would have made
it quite clear that the only type of convincing evidence —
QUESTION:

Would be certification.

MR. GOLD:

Would be certification.

Then Congress'

policy would have moved to the point of requiring an
election in every case, at least in every ease in which
you wanted to enforce —
QUESTION:

Do you read Gissel as — do you think

that this Court acquiesced in the board's abandonment of
the good faith test in Gissel?
MR. GOLD:

Your Honor

—

QUESTION:

And if we did, I take it you think

we made a mistake.
MR. GOLD:

Well, I am perfectly convinced that

you did not acquiesce and therefore I don't have to deal
with the possibility of coming here and arguing that a
prior decision was mistaken.
First of all, in Gissel, Chief Justice Warren,
with what we think was care, stated the question that vras
before the Court.

This is on page 29.

And he said, I

52
think this is the first sentence of the opinion, "These
cases involve the extent of an employer's duty under the
National Labor Relations Act, to recognize the union that
bases its claim to representative status solely on the
possession of union authorization cards."
QUESTION:

What page was the original opinion?

MR. GOLD:

That is 395 U.S. at 579-

That was the issue.

The union was arguing that

employer had to recognize the union on the basis of cards
no matter what the unfair labor

- no matter xtfhether or not

they were unfair labor practices.
QUESTION:

Didn't the opinion or didn't it,

clearly indicate that absent unfair labor practices, the
board — that the employer could petition for an election
and not have to bargain.
MR. GOLD:

I — I do not —

QUESTION:

You don’t think so?

MR. GOLD:

— believe that it did.

Again, we

discussed this at some length in terms of the discussion of
Section 9(c)(1)(b), the passage of the Court's opinion is
395 U.S. at 599 to 600 and all the Court said there, as we
read it, is that Section 9(c)(1)(b) supports the board
insofar as the board precluded an employer from committing
unfair labor practices and then saying that the union had to
secure a certification, but that does not mean, because the

53
Court threw out the opinion, put aside the union objection.
To say that a section supports the board against
the employer doesn't mean that it supports the board’s view
against later objections which were said not to be treated
in the opinion to the board’s view and there was not a word
in the Court's opinion with the possible exception of that
passage on 599-600 which says anything which supports the
board’s position here, indeed, we think that Gissel stands,
is the logical culmination of an evolution.
Starting with Joy Silk Mills, the board took a
subjective view to the good faith doubt standard that was
in the law prior to 1947.
We read the pre-47 cases a.3 attemptings of pain­
stakingly as it may be but, nevertheless, of attempting to
evolve a series of objective criteria to measure good faith
doubt.
After that, the board had a standard at times ~after ’47 there is a board case for any proposition.

But

we read the bulk of the cases going from Joy Silk Mills to
take quite a subjective view.
There was criticism of the board’s position in
two respects.
isation cards.

One, Insofar as the board relied on author­
Authorisation cards were attacked as

unreliable.
Secondly, there was intellectual criticism,

54
chiefly from Judge Friendly and from others, interestingly
enough, going all the way back to an opinion after '47 by
Judge Learned Hand, again, on the board's view that it was
logical to impute bad faith in denying recognition from
subsequent unfair labor practices.
Judge Friendly puts the point that it is just as
logical to believe that an employer could make sure that the
union didn’t gain a majority by commiting unfair labor
practices as that he believed the union already had a
maj ority.
QUESTION:

What do you think the Court meant in

this Gissel case, page 600, where the Court said, "For an
employer can insist on a secret ballot unless

in the

words of the board — 'he engages in contemporaneous unfair
labor practices likely to destroy the union's majority and
serious3.y impede a fair election.’"
MR. GOLD:

That was the passage I was referring

to, Mr. Chief Justice, discussing —
QUESTION:

Is that what you meant by that?

MR. GOLD:

I say, that is the passage I was

discussing a moment ago where the Court was discussing
9(c)(1)(b).

I read that to be one, a response to an

employer contention and

two, a statement of the board law

as it stood at the time of Gissel and not an adoption of
the board reading that; employer can always secure an

election.

I think that there is evidence throughout the

opinion, one, how the question was stated, two, the citation
with the seeming authority of Mine Workers versus_
Arkansas Oak Flooring.
QUESTION:

Well, to save time, I had read only

the latter part of it.

The language that I just read to

you was preceded by the statement by this Court, not
quoting anyone,

!,And we agree that the policies reflected

in 9(c)(1)(b) fully support the Court’s present adminis­
tration of the act —"
MR. GOLD:

That’s right.

QUESTION: "Before an employer can insist on a
secret ballot."
Isn’t that about as unequivocal a holding of the
Court as you could find?
MR. GOLD:

I don’t think it is a holding.

don’t even think it is a dictum, Mr. Chief Justice.

I
At

page 599, that paragraph is introduced by the statement,
"The employers rely finally on the addition to Section
9(c) of Subparagraph b which allows an employer to petition
for an election."
And then the Court says, "That provision was not
added, as the employers assert, to give them an absolute
right to an election at any time.

Rather, it was intended,

as the legislative history Indicates, to allow them, after

56
being asked to bargain, to test out their doubts as to a
union's majority in a secret election which they then —
which would then presumably not cause to be set aside by a
legal union activity,"
In other words, the Court started out by quoting
the language from the Senate Report upon which we rely.
Then it said that in light of the fact that Con­
gress only intended that section to go in favor — to run
in favor of an employer who had a reasonable doubt,

it

doesn't run in favor of employers who don't have such
doubts and who have impeded an election and to that extent,
it wa3 saying that the board was right in issuing bargaining
orders against employers who commit unfair labor practices.
But there is nothing in the opinion and, indeed,
at the start of the opinion, as I pointed out. the union's
positions were put aside.
The union's objections -— the union's objections
to the board law were put aside and not treated.

We don't

see how that case can be considered a decision which freezes
the board's present position into the law.
Indeed, the board hadn't gotten this far at the
time, Mr. Chief Justice, that Glssel was argued.

The board

acknowledged that Snow and Sons was good law and that
employers would have an obligation if they knew.
The board was taking the strange position that

57
an employer could close his eyes, had no obligation to look
around him.

But if, by chance, he opened his eyes and

found out something, then he could have an obligation to
bargain and that was part of the lav;, of the board lav; as
it stood.
QUESTION:

And there is nothing in Gissel, I take

it, suggesting that even if the employer had the right to
trial, that he has to or that he can just sit — that he
can just sit and wait for somebody else.
HR. GOLD:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

He might have the right to trial

without bargaining.
MR. GOLD:

Right.

I mean, we would consider

it

to be an erroneous rule to say that any time an employer
files, that frees him from the 8(a)(5) obligation as I
stated it.
But even that rule is different from the board’s
rule or from the rule that Hr. Come wants.
What they want is a rule that the employer can
sit there, no matter what the union does, and that there is
never an obligation on the employer so long as he is smart
enough to keep his eyes closed and so long as he doesn't
commit unfair labor practices.
QUESTION:

By trial you mean petition?

HR. GOLD:

Yes, petition.

To file a petition.

58
QUESTION:

Under 9(c)(1)(b).

MR. GOLD:

Right.

The board does not take the

position that an employer ever has to do anything, as long as
he has certain negative restraints on him, as someone has
said.

But he has no affirmative obligations under Section

8(a)(5).
QUESTION:

Even if the language from Glssel could

be read as literally and as strongly and as much of a
holding in that case as has been suggested, the most it
would mean is that the beard can insist that the employer
avail himself of 9(c)(1)(b).
MR. GOLD:

That's right.

QUESTION:

Not that he wait for the union, I

MR. GOLD:

That's right, sir.

QUESTION:

The union's petition.

MR. GOLD:

I believe that that would be the most

take it.

and, as I say, that is not the board's position nor is It
the position of the employer.
I was discussing the 19^7 Amendments and to what I
have already said, I simply wish to note a citation, as I
have mentioned, the only document recited in our brief is
the House Conference report because we take It as a complete
acknowledgement by the House that they had receded.
We would also like to call to the Court’s

59
attention that In the two- volume legislative history of
the NRLA at page 1539, Senator Taft inserted his explanation
of the conference agreement and there he said, "The
language of the conference agreement is identical with the
corresponding provisions in the Senate Amendment, since the
Senate conferees refused to yield to the House with respect
to the provisions contained in the House bill amending the
provisions in Scetion 8(2) relating to company-dominated
unions and subsection 8(5) relating to collective bargain­
ing.

This means that the five unfair labor practices

contained in the present NLRA remain unchanged."
Now, it is our view that this situation is there­
fore the same as the Curtis Brothers case in 362 U.S. 274
which is reviewed in our brief at

pages 22 to 24 and

quoted therein.
There, the board, after '47, attempted to make
recognitional picketing by a minority of unfair labor
practice.
They did so in the face of a conference report
which said there is no intent to make recognitional
picketing an unfair labor practice.
Their justification was, we are only making
minority recognitional picketing unlawful and in conference
all they said was that they were not going1 to prohibit all
recognitional picketing and that leaves us this smaller area

60
in which to undermine, if I may, the Congressional intent.
And the Court said, absolutely not.
This is the same argument that is being presented
here.

The argument being presented here is that the

conferees only wanted to continue the power of the board to
issue bargaining orders where the employer committed unfairlabor practices.
There is not a word in the conference report to
suggest that, Indeed, as we say, when you put all the pieces
together, the language of the act which creates a duty and
which doesn’t relate it to other obligations imposed by the
National Labor Relations Act by the law from ’35 to ’^7. by
the language of the House Conference Report, the language of
Senator Taft.

:

In the Senate, what they were doing was hewing to
the line that had been established in the past.

We think the

board has to hew to that line.
Not in every particular.

Not as to whether cards

are enough or something else is enough, but so as not to
make what was once a duty into a privilege.

That, we think,

the beard cannot do.
I 'banted to say some other things about Gissel,
most prominently the fact that Gissel cites with approval
Mine Workers _versuj3_ Arkansas Oak Flooring, a case in this
Court, a preemption case but a pre-Gharman preemption case

61
which is cited and. discussed at 25 to 27 of our brief.
There the Court stated the law as It understood
it at that time, after 19^7.

They said, "Under Sections

8(a)(5) and 9(a) and by virtue of the conceded majority
designation of the union, the employer is obligated to
recognise the designated union."
"Conceded" there was used in the term of
uncontroverted, as we indicate.
How Glssel can be thought to close the door on
us here, in light of its discussion and citation of
Workers,

Mine

we don't understand.
Nor do we think there is any logical implication

from the fact that Glssel says that where there are serious
unfair labor practices, there

shall be a bargaining order

and where there are not serious unfair labor practices,
there shall not be.
The Court, in Gissel, was discussing the remedial
power of the board to remedy a Section 8(a)(1).
As I started to say, the evolution has been to
criticise the board's good faith test insofar as that test
made the existence of other unfair labor practices a basis
for finding of good faith and what Glssel did and what the
board did about the tine of Glssel was to clean un this
area and to say that logically what we are doing is
entering an order to remedy the other unfair labor practice.

62
We are really not making a finding of fact as to
whether the employer had good faith doubt in refusing
recognition in the first place and at pages 32 and 33 of our
brief, we cite and discuss a case called Steel Fab. Inc., a
very recent board decision, which the board says precisely
L.hat I am trying to say here, that what Gissel did was talk
about the board’s power under Section 10(c), its power to
remedy illegal discharges, illegal interrogation and so on,
but it didn’t say what 8(a)(5) means.
And what the board is really trying to do here is
to say that 8(a)(5) means nothing.

There is no obligation

on an employer, strictly by 8(a)(5), no obligation to
recognize the unions selected or designated, only an
obligation to recognize the union’s certified, and not only
certified, but a union that has gone and gotten certifi­
cation .
And why do we care?

I think that is really the

last question.
I think that evervthing I have said thus far
indicates that we are right on the law.
but why do we care?

And the reason we care is

that the lav/ that the board has adopted and that the
employers want here, creates employer free choice.
The employer has the free choice to decide whether
or not there will be an election.

If he wants an election,

63
there will be an election.

If he wants to recognize the

union, he can.
That isn't employee free choice.

There are times

when people have manifested their desire so clearly that
there is no longer a real nuestion.
QUESTION:

Well, you say employer free choice,

but the union can petition for an election.
MR. GOLD:

Nell, it is employer free choice —

sure, the union can petition for an election.

If it wants

to go through the more time-consuming route, it can.
The only question is whether Congress said that
it had to.
QUESTION:

Well, but when you say employer free

choice, you give the impression that the petition is solely
in the hands of the employer, but the union, If it petitions
for an election, takes the play away from the employer.
MR. GOLD:

Yes, but the employer lias everything

to gain by that play.

As Mr. Come quite candidly said,

what the employer wants is to wait as long as possible.
I don’t know of any union which has ever
petitioned for an election when the employer has come to
him and said please, please don’t petition for an election.
We will recognize you now.
The union wants the recognition.
employer does not.

Normally, the

If they both want the recognition, there

Is never an election at all.
’/hat we are dealing with here Is the case where
the employer says it won’t recognize you.
QUESTION:
for an election?

Well, then, why can the uniore petition

Why doesn’t that solve their problem?

MR. GOLD:

It doesn't solve their problem, as I

am starting to say. In that it takes a long time and it
gives the employer all sorts of options to delay bargaining
and —
QUESTION:

Your real criticism isn't that It gives

the employer free choice, but that you don’t like elections.
MR. GOLD:

No.

Our real objection is that the

employer can play it either way.
If the employer doesn't like elections and he
wants to recognize, there is nothing that stops him.
On the other hand, Congress said that, in this
statute, that the employer is supposed to have a duty, a
ducy

to recognize and the question is, what is the pre­

condition?
And what the board is saying here is that the
employer has the option.

He can either have an election or

not5 if the union is knocking at the door and he doesn’t
want to accord them recognition.
We don’t think that Congress has said there has
to be an election every case.

The logic of the situation is

65
that that clop;s the machinery.

It pelves the employer a

chance to dissipate the majority.

There has Deen much talk

in the employer’s brief about the Franks Brothers case.
It was a case in which unfair labor practices
were committed, but this is what Mr. Justice Black said,
"The unlawful refusal of an employer to bargain collectively
with its employees' chosen representatives disrupts the
employees morale, deters their organizational activities
and discourages their membership in unions."
We think that is true.

There are cases In which

employees are willing to manifest their desire to be
represented in a way in which the employer can check.
Where that is the case, we think that Congress is
determined, by keeping the word "selected" or "designated,"
by ratifying the pre-1935 law, to let them do so.
That hasn't gone to the proposition — its
policy has not yet moved to the point of requiring election,
no matter how stronp; the union’s proof is.
I v/ant to say one word in my few remaining sec­
tions on Section 8(b)(7).
This is the second case this term where Section
8(b)(7) has been dragged in by its heels by counsel on a
post hoc basis.
The first was the Emporium case which was arp^ued
a month or so ago.

In that case, the board relied somewhat

66
on 8(b)(7) even though the board decision had not touched
8(b)(7) and even though the union argued that there was no
picketing there but only handbills.
Here, there was an explicit board holding at page
171 of the NLRB petition Appendix that 8(b)(7) is irrelevant
here because 8(b)(7) does not relate to situations in which
the employers illegally refuse to bargain.
Nevertheless, both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Come stood
up here and argued that Section 8(b)(7) supports their view
of the statute.

We think that is completely impermissible.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Gold.

Do you have anything further?

You have about

four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
NORTON J. COME, ESQ.
MR. COME:

Just two points.

With respect to Gissel, of course, the Court Is in
the best position to know what it held in Gissel.

However —

QUESTION:

Well, some of us are.

MR. COME:

At page 591 of the Court's opinion in

Gissel, the Court describes the board’s current practice as
follows:
"When confronted by a recognition demand based on
the possession of cards allegedly signed by a majority of its
employees, an employer need not grant recognition immediately

67
but may, unless he has knowledge Independently of the cards
that the union has a majoritys decline the union's request
and insist on an election, either by requesting the union
to file an election petition or by filing such a petition
himself, under Section 9(c)(1)(b)."
Now, it is that description of the board’s current
practice that the Court later on in Gissel found to be in
accord with the policies of Section 9(c)(1)(b) and,
furthermore, later on in the Gissel opinion, in meeting the
employer's argument that he is between Scylla and Charybdis
when faced with a card check because, if he accepts it and
the union doesn't have a majority, he is guilty of a
violation under Bernhard-Altmann, but if he attempts to
question to find out whether there is, in fact, a majority
of employees support it, he would be guilty of an 8(a)(1)
violation.
The Court, again, states that under the board's
current practice, the employer is not obligated to inves­
tigate.

He can simply decline the recognition request

but that insofar as what the board's policy was at the
time of Gissel, that was it.
The board made it perfectly clear that the
employer was not obligated to file a petition under 9(c)(1),
but could invite the union to do so.
Now, secondly —

QUESTION:

Wells that didn’t reach independent

knowledge, did it?
MR. COME:

No, it did not reach independent

QUESTION:

I just wanted to —

MR. COME:

However3 the Court, in Gissel,

knowledge.

recognized — we submit — that the board could reject the
good faith doubt test and the board, on reflection, after
Gissel, concluded — and we submit reasonably so, that the
independent knowledge element would plunge the board into
the same good faith doubt thicket that it was in under
Joy Silk.
Now, with respect to the legislative history, the
board’s position does not ignore the fact that Congress, in
19^7* decided not to adopt the House proposal that would
have made a board certification the only basis on which you
could predicate a bargaining obligation.
The one situation where that is not so is in the
case of voluntary recognition.
The second exception, which is the principal
situation, because that is where most of the card-based
bargaining orders are found, are in a situation where the
employer’s unfair

labor practices have precluded the holding

of a fair election.
If the House amendment had been adopted, you

69
couldn't sustain a Gissel bargaining order.

You would have

needed a certification notwithstanding the fact that the
employer had engaged in all kinds of unfair labor practices,
they would have precluded the holding of an election.
The third situation where a bargaining order can
be predicated on a showing less than a board election is
the Snow & Sons situation where the employer agrees to
a means other than a board election and then doesn't like
the results and reneges on it.
Now, therefore, we are in — not in an area like
Cortes or Insurance Agents inhere Congress has said, this is
as far as you can go and the board is going further, but
we are in the area where, and the Court of Appeals agrees
on that point, where Congress did leave room for board
discretion, namely, what sort of — what situations are
you going to permit a showing less than a board election?
And the board, we submit, is reasonable in
concluding that, short of the three situations that I have
just outlined, an election is a means that is most likely
to effectuate the overall policies of the act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr. Come.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11:38 o'clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
