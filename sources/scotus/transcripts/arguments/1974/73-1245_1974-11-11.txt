PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1245.
Hr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES ET AL
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes here on the government's petition
for a writ of certiorari to the United States’ Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

It arises from the

issuance of an Internal Revenue summons in the course of an
investigation by the Internal REvenue Service into a series
of unusual currency transactions.
Specifically, the question, a statutory one, is
whether the Internal Revenue Service has power to issue a
summons in order to discover the identity of a person who
may be liable for unpaid

taxes.

The bank involved, where the unusual currency
transactions occurred, is the Commercial Bank of Middlesboro,
Kentucky, of which Respondent Bisceglia is a vice-president.
The facts are basically simple and undisputed.
In November, 1970, the Commercial Bank deposited
on two separate occasions $20,000 in 100-dollar bills with

the Federal Reserve Bank In Cincinnati, which is a branch of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
These bills, as the testimony characterized them
in the District Court, were "tissue-paper thin," which
suggested a long period of storage in perhaps an unusual
place.
Under regular Federal Reserve procedures, the
matter was reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cincinnati
to the Internal Revenue Service.
The deposit of such a large amount of cash was
unusual in this context and it was expecially unusual for
the bills to be badly worn.

For example, testimony

developed that during the first ten months of this year In
1970, the Commercial Bank of Middlesboro had only deposited
with the Federal Reserve Bank of

Cincinnati, 218 $100 bills

and here, within a two-week period in November, 1970, it
deposited an additional
QUESTION:

*100 of them.

Mr. Smith, are you implying, then, that

the situation might be different had this been New York City
and one of the major banks there?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I am suggesting that in the

context of this case that such a large amount of cash was
unusual and, perhaps, I think the Internal Revenue Service
might not have been alerted in the context of a large
commercial center such as New York.

But I don't think that

that —- I don.'t think that the facts — the fact that this
case might arise in New York would limit the statutory power
of the Internal Revenue Service.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, there were were other

bills than the hundreds, weren’t there?
MR. SMITH:

I think there were only four -- my

impression is that there were only 400 $100 bills, a total
of $40,000.

But these were the — this was the —

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

This hit the regulation because there
Exactly, because these were regulations

that the Federal Reserve maintained prior to the enactment
of the

Bank Secrecy Act which the Court considered last

term in the California Banker’s Association case.

But the

Federal Reserve procedures were to report this to the
Internal Revenue Service.
Now, from the Internal REvenue Service’s point of
view, this event suggested that substantial transactions had
occurred outside normal financial channels.

In fact, the

supervisor of the currency section of the Federal Reserve
Bank in Cincinnati testified that it was his recollection
the only comparable situation where bills were so badly worn
as to be tissue-paper thin, that the sizing of the paper
had completely disintegrated and they were difficult to
count, had occurred in the situation where a cash horde
had been stored in milk cans which, in turn, had been buried

6
in concrete.
Now, this kind of situation suggested to the
Internal Revenue Service that the recipient of this cash
horde may well have received it in a manner — and had not
satisfied a tax liability on it.
Now, the possibilities are numerous.

It could be

an amount of money that was received and hidden away for
which income tax was not paid on.
It could have been a horde of someone who died
and estate taxes may not have been paid upon it.
It could have been a gift of someone, in which
case the donor may not have paid the gift tax on it.
The course of these possibilities, which are, we
believe, reasonable to the Internal REvenue Service, the
Internal Revenue SErvice commenced an investigation and in
the course of that investigation, it issued a summons to the
Commercial Bank of Middlesboro and to Mr. Bisceglia
specifically to produce all records in connection with the
deposit of this matter that may shed some light on the
deposit of this matter.
Now, because the tax — because the identity of the
taxpayer was unknown In this Instance, the IRS summons was
drawn, "In the Matter of the Tax Liability of John Doe."
But it was fully contemplated that once the identity of
John Doe was established to the Service’s satisfaction, that

(
the Service would then commence an audit of the taxpayer or
the depositor^ or transferors tax returns and inquire as to
the means of acquisition of this cash horde and to determine
xvhether all tax liabilities had been satisfied on it and
the bank refused to comply with the summons, so the United
States commenced this action, which was on a petition for
enforcement of the summons under Section 7604 of the Inter­
nal Revenue Code.
After holding —
QUESTION:

Why was the action brought against

this individual, Mr. Bisceglia, or whatever his name is?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

He was an officer of the bank who —
He was a trust officer, wasn’t he?
He was a trust officer of the bank,

but he had supervisory power over the records.
QUESTION:

And he says he doesn't know anything

about this.
MR. SMITH:

Well, he personally did not have any

knowledge of the — the Respondent argues that —
QUESTION:

My real question is, why didn't you

bring it against the bank?

Why did you bring it against

this individual, this trust officer?
MR. SMITH:

Well, my impression was that this

officer of the bank was singled out as someone who had the
supervisory power over the records who could produce them.

The summons asked for two things.

It asked for production

of records, which Mr- Bisceglia I think undisputably had
power to direct the Internal Revenue Service to examination
and it also asked the testimony.
Now, the Respondents make a point of the fact that
Mr. Bisceglia could not have testified as to these circum­
stances, but we think that the production of the records is
the key here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there in

the morning.
[Whereupon, at 3:00 o’clock p.m., the Court was
adjourned until 10:00 o’clock a.m. the following day.]
