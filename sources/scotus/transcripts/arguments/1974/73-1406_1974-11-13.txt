MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

first this morning in No, 73-1406, Chapman and others against
Meier.
Mr. Kelly, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KELLY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KELLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from a judgment from the United
States District Court for the District of North Dakota,
which established a permanent apportionment plan, that is
permit, for the 1970's, based on the 1970 decennial census.
The judgment involves a plan that establishes five
large multi-member districts, involving both houses of the
North Dakota Legislature, and involves a — in terms of
population, variances in excess of 20 percent, an over-all
average of, I think, plus and minus five percent, or an
average of ten percent variance.
The issues that we present, first of all, involve
the issue of whether a court in fashioning a plan, and absent
any contrary State policy which would support the establish­
ment of multi-member districts or unusual or unique circum­
stances, could deny the appellants the equitable remedy cf
single-member districting.

QUESTION;

Now, let me be sure I have one thing

clear here, and what differences may derive from it.

You're

asking us to review xiot a plan enacted by the Legislature of
the State, but to review a plan manadated some five, six, seven
years ago by the Federal District Court; is that right?
MR. KELLY;

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

except that the plan that we are asking for review of today
is a plan that was established as a permanent plan by a judg­
ment that was entered in January of 1974.
QUESTION;

That "was a judgment of a court not of

the legislature?
MR. KELLY;

That is correct.

This is not a review of a plan that has been adopted
by the North Dakota Legislature.
The facts basically are that following the 1970
Census, the Legislative Assembly in North Dakota failed to
adopt a plan.

We started this lawsuit in Federal Court, asking

for reapportionment based on the substantial changes in
population within the State of North Dakota, basically a shift
from rural to urban areas, under the Equal Protection Clause,
and the decisions of this Court; and then we also, in that
case, requested, pursuant to Connor v. Johnson, the application
of the equitable remedy of single-member districts.
In North Dakota, the tradition was from Statehood
until the mid-1960°s a tradition based on a constitutional

5

provision, specifically Section 29, that Senatorial districts
V7ere to be represented by one Senator and no more.
QUESTION:

Is this all you’re complaining about are

Senatorial districts?

You had a tradition, haven't you, of

multi-member House districts at all times?
MR. KELLY: We have had a tradition that has basically
been one Senator and two House district members; now the
Constitution, until these provisions were voided by decisions
of the Federal Court in the mid-1960?s, did provide ----- had a
restriction on establishment of Senate districts, in that you
couldn't break up a county, attach part of one county to
another county to form a Senate district.
You could take two counties and make on district,
but you couldn't break up a county.

You cou3.d also break

up a county as long as no part of the county was attached to
a —
QUESTION; All I'm saying is that your concern is on
the Senate side, and you've always had, on the House side,
mu 11 i ~mem.be r districts.
MR. KELLY:
the Senate side.

Our concern is on the — basically on

We concede, based an the traditions of

North Dakota, that it is not required, we asked ox-iginally
for single-member districts for both houses; but there is a
tradition of one Senator district — a
QUESTION:

district —

Wasn’t there a constitutional amendment

6
•that was defeated?
MR. KELLY:

There was a constitutional amendment

that was defeated, which established basically a ~~
QUESTION:
MR. KELLY:

Single districts?
Well, no, the basic thrust of the

amendment was not to establish single districts, it was to
establish a constitutional apportionment commission.
And it was presented to the people of North Dakota as
this was going to provide a way of apportioning the State
Legislature, taking this power from the State Legislature.
And the Attorney General, who was responsible for
**- with the Secretary of State -- for specifying what this
constitutional amendment provided, that was the thrust of
the amendment.
Now, the amendment also covered the establishment of
single-member districts for both houses of the Legislature.
But, in so far as the people of North Dakota knew, it was
only after the election that they were ever advised that they
had just rejected the concept of single-member districting.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, tills is the. so-called Dobson

Plan, isn't it?
MR. KELLY:

That's correct.

QUESTION: And I gather he was chairman, was he, of
a commission appointed by idle court?
MR. KELLY:

He was one of three members of the

7
commission that was appointed by the court.
QUESTION; But that's what it is, a court-appointed
commission, isn’t it?
MR. KELLY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Yes.

And was this — is this that

commission's plan, or just Mr. Dobson’s plan?
MR. KELLY:

It's just Mr. Dobson’s plan.

There

were other plans — and Mr. Dobson’s plan was first adopted
by an order of the District Court in June of 1972, as an
interim plan, because they had reached their determination
that the then existing apportionment plan was invalid under
the Equal Protection Clause —
QUESTION:

And there was some expression, wasn't

there, of perhaps constitutionally the Dobson plan, even as
an interim plan, was perhaps constitutionally deficient?
MR. KELLY: Well, there were some reservations.
The majority of the court at that time said, Well, we
recognize some deficiencies.

The substantial population

variances, the fact that the plan does not provide for single
member Senate districts; but they were faced with being in a
time situation, much like the situation was in, I think, in
Virginia, under the Mahan v, Howell case, where they were
really faced with — and -this was when it was adopted, as an
interim plan, originally.
QUESTION: But now it’s been adopted as a permanent

8
plan*
MR. KELLY;

The reconstituted majority of the District

Court adopted it as the permanent plan.
QUESTION: what do you mean by a reconstituted court?
MR, KELLY: Well, originally, two members of the
three-member court, Judge Bright and Judge Van Sickle,
decided that — adopted it only as an interim plan, saying:
After the 1972 elections, the special masters will report on
a permanent plan.
They expressed substantial interest in what was
called the Ostenson Plan, which was another plan that had
been proposed by one of the special masters.
But then, after the elections, there were some delays
for the elections, one of which Mr. Justice Douglas referred to.
I might point out that at that election, where the
proposed constitutional amendments were rejected by the will
of the people, the people also rejected a legislative plan
that had been passed by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly,
which provided for multi-member districts, much like the
Dobson Plan, and that was voted down.
So I don't think that you can look to the election
results in North Dakota, the special elections that were
conducted in December of 1973, and say this establishes a
State policy in favor of multi-member districts or really in
opposition. Because the people voted no on both issues.

9

QUESTION;

If we were to reverse the judgment, as

you ask us to do, what sort of instructions are you suggesting
that we give to the district, or you wouldn't want us to
draw a plan here, I take it?
MR. KELLY:

We’re not asking for that at all, sir,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
What we are asking for is, on this issue, is a
reversal with directions to follow the supervisory directive
that this Court gave in, first, in Connor v. Johnson, and
has reiterated, that when the court is called upon to fashion
a reapportionment plan, in the absence of some contrary
State policy or special or unique circumstances, that you
should do so on the basis of single-member districts.
QUESTION: But of course that wasn’t an inexorable
rule on either of those cases.
MR. KELLY:

Right.

It is not — we’re not submitting this issue on the
basis that it's a constitutional requirement.

But it is the

general rule.
Now, in the Whitcomb case from Indiana, there is an
exception recognised, based on an Indiana constitutional
provision that said you're not going to break up counties
to establish Senate districts.
And, as I understand the Whitcomb case, there was a
recognition that the general rule,, which is an equitable

10
remedy, had to give way in view of this legitimate State
policy.
But in North Dakota we don't have any, either a
constitutional or a statutory policy that would favor multimember districts.
The second exception, which I think the Court
recognized in the Virginia case, was that unique or unusual
circumstances can justify multi-member districts in a courtfashioned plan.

And in this case we're not saying that there

may be unique circumstances that will require some type of
multi-member districts to handle a situation which is really
quite the equivalent to that involved in the Virginia case,
we’ve got substantial military personnel at the Grand Forks
Air Force Base and at the Minot Air Force Base.
And if, in fact, based on an analysis which the court
had. called upon the Masters to make, about how to — a
proposal as to how to handle the military personnel.

If, in

fact, that unique situation would justify an adoption of a
plan that v?ould provide for some type of multi-member districting
to handle the military personnel at the two bases, then that’s
fine, we're not arguing x*ith that.
But what we're saying is that, absent a State policy,
and absent special or unique circumstances, this Court should
enforce the rule that it established, not as a constitutional
matter but as a matter of superintending direction over the

II
District Courts and the inferior courts, to give us what is
the equitable remedy of single-member districting.
QUESTION:

Well, do you say that the fact that tine

Legislature adopted a plan that encompassed multi-member
districts, even though it was ultimately defeated in a
referendum, can't be used by the District Court as any
indication of a State policy?
MR. KELLY:

I think that the Governor vetoed it,

it was passed over his veto, and the people voted it down.
And I would think under those circumstances that, since the
Legislature is just the representative of the people, that
— and in North Dakota we have the right to refer measures,
the people have the right to refer measures that they are
not satisfied with that the Legislature passed; that
legislation was referred, and it was defeated.
And I think under those cirexamstances it x^ould be
unsound to draw an inference that this somehow represents a
support, as far as State policy goes, for multi-member
districts.

I would think that, quite to the contrary, it

shows a reluctance by the people of North Dakota to accept
a program in a situation that xvas not established in the
first instance by the people of North Dakota or the politicians.
We never had this kind o€ districting in North
Dakota until the mid-1960's, at which time the court established
multi — large multi-member districts.

And in doing so they

12

said. Well, if there's any problem, the Legislature can
handle it.
Well, the Legislature has been handling it and
struggling with it for ten years, and they’ve never been able
to resolve it.

Because, obviously, the effect of this kind

of districting is, is that one party tends to win all the
seats.

And eight days ago there was somewhat of a changed

situation, in terms of the largest multi-member district,
five Senators from the one party were — all lost to the other
party.
But it seems to me that in terms of political fair­
ness — and we're not talking about political fairness
basically to the parties but to the people.

You're talking

about a situation where people are required to select 15 out
of 30 candidates,

Well, the conscientious voter is really

close to being rendered a basket case, if he really is serious
about trying to find out what individual qualifications are.
And these, I think, were factors that this Court
recognized back in — as early as '64 in the Colorado Assembly
case, where you enumerated defects in multi-member districts
but saying you were not prepared to rule that they were
unconstitutional, per
QUESTION:

3e.

Which was the largest number of Senators

in any one districts in the State?
MR. KELLY:

Mr. Kelly, this may be an unfair

What’s your guess as to what, if anything, the

Legislature will do come the turn of the year?

Are they meeting

in January?
MR. KELLY:
QUESTION:

They are meeting in January.
Is there any serious attempt to talk

about reapportionment?
MR. KELLY:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, the — this is not

a veto-proof Legislature this time, and there is a — the Execu-

14
tive Branch and the majority party in the Legislature are on
opposite sides of the fence, and when I say that this is a
dilemma or struggle that has been going on for ten years, it
is not going to be resolved at the next meeting of the
Legislative Assembly, for the reasons that it hasn't been
resolved since this type of districting was first established
back in 1965„

Because the Governor vetoes the multi-member

legislation, and this time, as distinguished from last time,
they had to take it to the vote of the people.

They are not

going to be able to override his veto this time.
QUESTION:

Of course this Legislative Assembly was

elected under this plan, and presumably has a vested interest
in the status quo.
That's been true since 1965, hasn't it?
MR. KELLY:

I think that that's the reason that

history has not borne out the observation by the, I think,
Judge Vogel in the '65 case, when it established multi-member
districting, that if there was a problem the Legislature would
take care of it.
Well, the Legislature has a vested, really quite a
vested interest in maintaining this type of districting.
And we're really faced with a situation where the
constitutional provisions that really provide the State
Legislature with authority to reapportion have been declared
invalid.

15
QUESTION: Well, what's —
MR. KELLY:

So there’s also a substantial question

as to v/hether the Legislature really has the authority to
reapportion itself.
QUESTION: Well, really, your troubles all stem from
the federal courts having gotten into the thing in the first
place, don’t they?
MR. KELLY:

They stem from -- right, from change

in the traditions of our State, and imposing this kind of a
legislative districting.
Now, the reconstituted majority in this case said
that they justified the continuation of the multi-member
districting on the basis that it wasn't, as a constitutional
matter they weren't required to break up these large
districts.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kelly, what was the change in the

panel from the interim order?
MR. KELLY:

Well, Judge Benson originally xvanted

to just adopt the Dobson Plan permanently, that t*as back in
'72.

Judge Bright and Judge Van Sickle said just for the '72

elections.
The decision on January 30, 1974, Judge Benson and
Judge Van Sickle made up the majority, and Judge Bright wrote
a dissent.
QUESTION:

How many of the three judges live in the

.16
State of North Dakota?
MR. KELLY; All three judges —QUESTION:
MR. KELLY:

All three?
— reside in North Dakota: Judge Bright

is, of course, on the —
QUESTION:

The Circuit —

MR. KELLY:

— Circuit Court of Appeals.

But they

all reside in North Dakota.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kelly, may I return for a minute to

the question asked you earlier by Justice Blackmun:

Are you

complaining about the multi-member districts for members of the.
House of Representatives as well as the Senate?
MR. KELLY:

In so far as — we're complaining if it

means that we’re going to have a district, a House district
with ten members; but we are willing to concede that in
accordance with the traditions of North Dakota, that a district
that would be comprised of one Senator and two House members,
which is what the original decision of Judge Benson and —
or Judge Bright and Judge Van Sickle was back in 1972, we are
willing to accept that because that is not a large multimember district, and it is historically, in accordance with
our traditions, and it would, it seemed to me, not confront
the people of North Dakota with the type of problems that they're
involved with now in terms of large districts, involving
large numbers of people

17
QUESTION: So two Representatives would be all
right, in your view?
MR. KELLY:

That's —

QUESTION:

From the same district.

MR. KELLY:

That’s our position.

We had

originally asked for single-member districting across the
board,, but, on reflection, considering the traditions of
North Dakota, in terms of single Senator districts, with twomember representation from the House,

we felt that that would

be more appropriate and that was all that the District Court
was prepared to give us and we at that time thought that
really meant — was a fair compliance with this Court’s
rule in Connor v. Johnson about avoiding large multi-member
districts, as a general male.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kelly, do you think there —

apparently you think there is no difference between our
revisiting or being asked to review the action of the State
Legislature on reapportionment and the action of a District
Court on reapportionment, independent of any legislative
enactment.
MR. KELLY: This is — we’re talking about the juris­
diction of the Court now to — I think that this is -QUESTION:

Weil, in any respect.

I’m asking you

what you think the difference is, or whether you think there
is no difference.

18

MR. KELLY:

Well, I think that if you were called upon

to review a State plan, as adopted by a State legislative body,
and that plan has multi-member districting, that in the
absence of some showing that this was discriminatory or
objectionable on constitutional grounds, that you'd have to
say, then, that that is a State policy which we will respect.
If it's not attacked on constitutional grounds.
But for — I think there's a different standard
that applies where —- that this Court has recognised and
developed, where you are reviewing a court-fashioned plan.
And this is a court-fashioned plan.
And this plan — that, to me, was, as my understanding
of the rule that you first set out in Connor v. Johnson about
— as a general rule.
QUESTION:

Here the State is defending the plan,

isn't it?
MR. KELLY: Well, the Attorney General of the State of
North Dakota appears as the attorney for the Secretary of
State of North Dakota, because he is the State officer that's
charged with enforcing the election laws, and we sought an
injunction against him.

And they — I don't know that the

Attorney General’s office has any more — provides any more
basis for saying this reflects State policy than the
Legislatura did.
The people ultimately, in North Dakota, decide what

19
policy is, and —
QUESTIONs

But in Mahan, for example, it was the

State that came to us and challenged the ruling of the threejudge district court which had revised the legislative
apportionment plan.
And here, it seems to me, you're in somewhat
different posture, because here the State is defending what
the District Court has done.
MR. KELLY:

The Attorney General is defending —

QUESTION: Well, the Attorney General.
MR. KELLY:

Right.

But there’s a distinction,

because it x^ould not be a fair conclusion to say that, after
all, the chief executive officer of the State of North
Dakota is

the

Governor, and he has — and this is referred to,

particularly in Judge Bright’s dissent — a veto message
which he refers to, and as the chief executive officer, he
states in that veto message to this legislative plan that
was adopted and then deafeated on referral, his opposition
to the legislative plan based on the establishment of large
multi-member districts.
So I do not think that there is, at best, the
appellee in this case is faced with a situation where there is
no discernible State policy, no identifiable one, pro or con,
because if you put aside our traditions •— but to say that
the State of North Dakota is here as a jurisdiction saying

20

this is our policy and our policy is in favor of larga multimember districts, that is really not the situation at all.
QUESTION; The State didn't appeal, did it?
MR. KELLY; The State was not a party to this case.
Just the Secretary of State.
QUESTION; Well, did the Secretary of State appeal?
MR. KELLY;

No, he —

QUESTION; So he's satisfied with the judgment?
MR. KELLY;

Right. The Secretary of State is,

presumably, and presumably the Attorney General of North
Dakota is satisfied.
QUESTION;
MR. KELLY;

He didn't appeal.
Right.

But the Governor is not

satisfied, nor are the people satisfied.
QUESTION; Who is representing the Governor here?
MR. KELLY;

The Governor is not a party.

The

Governor couldn't be a party, because he doesn't enforce the
election laws.
QUESTION; Are you suggesting that your friend who
will argue in opposition to you is not speaking for the
State of North Dakota through its Secretary of State?
MR. KELLY;

He's speaking for the Secretary of State.

If — if —
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting he's speaking for him

as an individual, or as a State officer?

2.1

MR. KELLY %

He's speaking for him as a State

officer.
QUESTION;
MR. KELLY:
QUESTION;

Yes.
Right.
Then what's the difference between that

and his being here for the State?

You have me lost a little

bit.
MR. KELLY;

Well, my only point is that if, in

fact, this is to suggest that there is a State policy favoring
multi-member districts, that that is not a fair conclusion to
be drawn by reason of the fact that the Secretary of State
and the Attorney General are attempting to support and
justify thi3 court-imposed plan.
QUESTION; Well, maybe one speculation, as reasonable
as that, or as reasonable as any other, is that the Secretary
of State and the Attorney General merely want to let this
plan stay in effect until the Legislature can come to grips
with it in a few months from now.
MR. KELLY;

Well, we've been waiting for ten years

or more, and, as I say, in all candor, there is no reasonable
prospect that they are going to.
In the few remaining moments, I would also point out
that the second issue involves population disparities, and
the disparities in this plan exceed those that were involved
in the Virginia case, and there is,contrary to the Virginia

22
case, no justifiable State policy that would support the type
of deviations we’re involved with here.
The txtfo that were offered ware that there is a
geographic barrier, the Missouri River.

Indeed, it is a

geographic barrier, but it provides no barrier at all to the
establishment of equal population districts.

That is not

a problem, and that's covered in detail in the brief.
The second point was, is that North Dakota is a
small agricultural, rural State, and it's just not that
important to get precise districts.
Well, North Dakota has a tradition that it carried
on at this last election, of having extremely close election
results.

And the individual's voting power in a small State,

the one person's vote recally can have a substantial impact,
And with the type of issues that are going to be
presented to the North Dakota Legislature, involving not only
the future of North Dakota but large parts of the nation,
involving the development of resources, it seems to me that
equity and fairness and, to say nothing of the Constitution,
requires a better job of drawing district lines in terms of
establishing fair apportionment.
And the Dobson Plan, which was basically designed
to meet an emergency and had, as one of its standards, tc draw
the new lines as closely as you could to the existing lines
which were being stricken, because they provided a representa-

23

fcion that was violative of the Equal Protection Clause.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

Mr. Sand.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SAND;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Coart:
Counsel has stated the historic development fairly
accurately, but I believe he listed some things as being a
little more technical than the real practical situation, as
it existed.
Prior to 1965, true. North Dakota had a senatorial
district, and they had multi-member House districts.
it i*as basically on the county setup.

And

The counties could not

be taken and attached to another part of a county, but could
be moved together, several counties could be comprised to
consist one senatorial district.
But in the more populous counties, the county
could be divided, and in fact there were several that were
divided, in which the Legislature created one, two, or three
senatorial districts; but in those districts that were created,
the county remained a3 the basic unit and, for all practical
purposes, in the Legislature and in discussion of the
Senators, they were referred to as the Senator from Cass

County, even though Cass County had two senatorial districts»
It was QUESTION;

How many counties are there in your

MR. SAND;

Fifty-three, Mr. Justice Stewart.

State?

QUESTION:

Thank you. And under the old system,

before the court got into it, how many Senators were there?
MR, SAND:
QUESTION:
MR. SAND:

Forty-nine.
And twice as many Representatives?
No, sir.

QUESTION;

Mors than that?

MR. SAND:

There we had no one-to-two ratio.

The

one-to-two ratio came into being in 1965 by the Federal
District Court's action —
QUESTION s

By the court plan, unh-hunh.

MR. SAND;

But prior to that time we had a

variance of anywhere from one Representative to five.
}

J.

QUESTION;

Per county.

it-

MR. SAND:

Par district.

QUESTION:

Per district.

MR. SAND;

Right.

Even though the ordinary reference was to the
county, but in some counties we had more than one senatorial
district.
And, true, the Legislature has toiled with this

25

problem and has made some very sincere efforts.
But about I960, through our constitutional process,
a constitutional amendment was adopted which froze the
senatorial districts as they existed.

It also created a

board v;hich was charged with the duty of reapportioning the
State if the Legislature failed to do so.
This board consisted of the two majority leaders of
each house, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General and
the Chief Justice of the State of North

Dakota.

They labored with this problem long and heavy, but
because of the provisions of Section 35, it was just impossible
to do what the language provided.
And, as a result of that, the reapportionment plan
that was adopted by this committee was declared unconstitu­
tional, and then from there the actions were brought in the
federal courts, and then from 1965 we have developed a
different pattern.
And this is where the Federal District Courtfashioned plan provided for senatorial districts with more
than one Senator, but the ratio was, for each Senator they
would have two Representatives.
Nov;, this plan stayed in existence, and the
Legislature in 1971 did not reapportion.

There were feeble

efforts made, but if I can summarize some of*the eoitmisnts'
made by the Legislators, they said:

We just don't know where

26
to qo, what we can do? and some even said, Well, let the coux*t
do it.
Well, these are some of the difficulties with the
Legislature.
When this action was initially brought, and a
temporary plan established, a bi-partisan committee was
created for the purposes of proposing a plan to the 1973
Legislature.

This committee worked hard and long and

developed what I would say is a very good plan, as far as the
variants; but, because it contained multi-member districts,
the Governor vetoed the plan.

It was overridden, and then

referred to the people.
About the same time, an initiated constitutional
measure was submitted to the people.

This measure provided

for a board to reapportion the State and also provided that
the board provide for single-member districts.
Mow, when the people rejected both of these
measures, we had to assume that the people were, in effect,
saying:

Leave us be; let us have thepLan that we have now.
The constant changing of boundary lines, I believe,

hurts a representative form of government more so, or
equally so, than a variance in population.
Identification with the district lines is an
essential element of representation.

And the people, when

they rejected the legislative plan, my impression was that it

27

was rejected because it broke entirely too many county lines.
To say that it was rejected because it had multi­
member districts flies in the face of the people’s rejection
of the constitutional measure which would have provided for
single-member districts.
And on that basis, we are representing the people
of the State of North Dakota, even though counsel may have
some reservations about that.

The Secretary of State, of

course, is a State constitutional officer, and the Attorney
General, by law and by common law in the State of North
Dakota, represents the people there.
So we have no reservation whatsoever that the
Attorney General and the Secretary of State, Den Meier, are
representing the people of the State of North Dakota.
So, historically, we have consistently had multi­
member districts for the House of the State of North Dakota,
and from 1965 we have had multi-member districts for the
Senate.
QUESTION:

But that's only as a result of the

court intervention, isn't it?
MR. SAND:

Right.

Now, prior to the court’s intervention, and
recognizing also Section 35 of this constitutional amendment
which froze the districts, I think at that point the State
actually operated what we would refer to as a little federal

28

system.
The Senate had area, the House was on population.
Even though the counties, in several instances, were gathered
together to make an area, and in other instances counties
were divided to make an area.
But it was still basically a concept of the little
federal system.
QUESTION: General Sand, let me get straightened out.
Prior to 1965 were your House districts single-member
districts?
MR. SAND:

No, no, they were not, Justice Blackmun.

They were anywhere from one to five, depending on the popula­
tion.
QUESTION:

So that the two-to-one isn't a very long

tradition at all, it's only a decade?
MR. SAND:

Since 1965.

QUESTION:

And it's a court-imposed tradition, then?

MR. SAND:

Correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Did you have many — you say one to five
before 1965; did you have many multi-member House districts?
Probably far fewer than you had single-member districts.
MR. SAND:

I think we had quite a few

with two

Representatives;we had a sizable number, I would — just
recalling here for the moment, about five or six that had more
than two.

29

QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

Largely the larger cities?

MR. SAND:

In the larger counties, like Cass,

Grand Forks, Barnes, Richland, Ward, and the larger counties,
or the counties that had the larger cities»
We also believe that where the Legislature is —
where the court is required to fashion the plan, that the
court should fashion a plan which is somewhat patterned after
the State plan in existence.
Now, true, a plan can be developed which would cut
down the variants, but in order to accomplish that and at
the same time maintain some respect for county lines, we'd
have to reduce the number of Senators and Representatives,
the legislative bodies, both would have to be reduced.
But as far as the number of Senators and Representa­
tives, I think this is basically a judgment of the people.
We have had consistently representation in the House from
98 to 101, or in that vicinity.

And 49 to 51 in the Senate.

Now, if the court would have gone to a reduced
number, yes, our variances may not be that great.

But I

think the number should be respected, because it gives the
greater division amongst the electoratej and in the same t^ay
it also gives members in the House and Senate, which are
more responsive to that particular area.
And again in North Dakota, the county is the basic
political subdivision.

The county performs many, many

30

functions for, in behalf of the State.

And to break up the

county lines actually destroys the responsiveness to the
county needs.
And on the variants, we find it a little difficult
to attempt to speak about accuracy or exactness in population,
when we know that the initial Census is not accurate in itself,
As this Court has said, that is a process, but it is not
necessarily accurate.
We have in our brief set out a few of -the cities
which have had a Census taken since the 1970 Census, and we
find that quite a few of them have grown substantially, and
in one instance where the variance was 11 percent, by taking
new population, it has been reduced to 4 percent.
And it would seem to me that it would be somewhat
inequitable to require an exact mathematical formula, based
upon a figure which is initially not accepted as being
correct, and then go from there, when it's reasonably understood
that in the matter of a year or two those population figures
will no longer be representative.
And we operated under that for a ten-year period.
And in the State of Worth Dakota, under the situation
that we have here, I would submit that a population variance
of 20 percent, or in that area, is not out of line.
the natural barrier to contend with.
in this instance, they

We have

And I think the Court

are people from the State, they know

31

the needs, they know the area, they came up with a plan that
is satisfactory to the State of North Dakota.
And if I may just simply repeat, that when the
elections on the initiated measure, constitutional measure,
and the referendum on the legislative plan were rejected by
the people, the people v/ere in fact saying:

Leave us be as

we are created.
QUESTION:

Of course, General, the fact that this is

satisfactory to the people of your State, under the decisions
of this Court, rightly or wrongly, just doesn't cut any ice
at all.

You remember Lucas vs. Colorado Assembly, in which

the people of the State, by vote, had accepted that plan, and
the Court said, nonetheless it's unconstitutional; or even
going back to Baker v. Carr,

the State, officials of the

State were wholly satisfied with that system, so they told us.
They were defending that system in this Court.
MR. SAND:

I would agree with that, Justice

Stewart.
QUESTION:

So, that alone doesn't, rightly or

wrongly, as I say, under the precedents of this Court, that
doesn't cut any ice whatsoever.
MR. SAND:

What I should have said, and really

had in mind, was that within the constitutional limits, the
people are satisfied with this system that they have now,
and we think that a 20 percent variance is not unconstitutional

32

under these conditions.
And if the people are satisfied with it, and if it
meets the constitutional requirements, then there should be
no change made.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you1ve just

mentioned again the 20 percent variance.

I don't recall whether

in any opinions of the Court we have ever distinguished
between, in percentages between a large area like New York
or California, and a smaller State like North Dakota; but if
my arithmetic is correct, and I don't vouch for it, the
variation per Senator elected from the highest to the lowest
is only 786 votes; 786 voters.
That is, 11,775 in the 29th district to 12,561 in
the 18th district.

That’s on page 3 of your brief.

Now, having said that, if my arithmetic is correct —
which I'm not sure it is — do you think the Court ought to
exert much greater flexibility in dealing with a small number
of voters than with a percentage that would make a variation
of hundreds of thousands?
MR. SAND:

Chief Justice Burger, in that respect,

in the small number, I mean these percentages really can be,
in a sense, frightening, because you have a change of 100 or
200, and the percentage goes way out.
Whereas if you had larger numbers, you can have
this

33

QUESTION:
MR. S7^ND:

Cuts both ways.
Yes, it cuts in both directions.

And the reason why we believe that this variation
is justifiable is because we have had a constant change in
population.

Ironically we have had, up until 1970, a decrease

in population, but also a change from rural to urban within
the State.
But from 1970 to 1974, according to the latest
report in the U.S. World News, based upon the U. S. Census,
the State of North Dakota has gained, since 1970, a little
better than 4 percent population.
Where that population is at the moment, I am not
prepared to say.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Kelly?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KELLY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KELLY:

Just two points.

In response to a question that Mr. Justice Blackmun
asked Mr. Sand, I would point out that the one Senator to two
House member ratio has been, over-all, the standard since
Statehood, except in so far as our original Constitution
provided that both houses should be — districts should be of
equal population, to the extent that that could be done.

34

But the problem was that since there was a restriction
on Senate districts, not taking part of one county and making
it a part of a Senate district that involved another county,
that there were necessarily population imbalances; and in
order to correct that situation, certain districts were
given additional House members.

But the vast majority of

districts since Statehood have always had two House members
and one Senator.
And so that while it's not an absolute tradition
of one Senator and two House members, the over-all tradition
is clearly on that kind of a basis.
In so far as, Mr. Chief Justice, your reference to
the disparities in populations, based on the Dobson Plan,
I think we're talking about between — in terms of people, of
just about something between 2400 and 2500 people, the
difference between the largest or most under-represented
district, or the smallest or over — most over-represented
district; and I think there's an Appendix — there is an

A-6 and 7 of the Jurisdictional.

MR. KELLY:

But,, in any event, the — it's a small population
and each one is important.
QUESTION:

There's a population difference of

2444 between the largest and the smallest.
MR. KELLY:

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.
1064 in district 4, and 1384 in district

11, and they add up to 2400.
MR. KELLY:

Right.

QUESTION:

Not 700.

QUESTION:

But when you allocate that per Senator,

you get a slightly different figure.
MR. KELLY:

Well, that's true.

QUESTION:

Those are both single-member districts?

MR. KELLY: Right.
QUESTION:

Do you know what percentage of the

Senate can — well, never mind.
MR. KELLY:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:52 o'clock, a.ra., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.
