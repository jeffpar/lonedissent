MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

ne;.rt in Wo. 74-634, United States against Nobles.
Mr,» Friedman, you may proceed when you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FREIDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it nlease

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The issue, as we see it, is whether a trial judge

f'-o time arter the defendant has offered that investigator
as a witness in his own behalf

and after the direct testimony

of chat investigator, who was called for the specific purpose
of impeaching government witnesses who already have testifyod.
QUESTION;

Why do you refer to .it as ordering a

defendant to de it, Mr. Friedman?

Couldn’t an order ba

directed to the witness himself?
Mk„ .vRiED.hAN:

Well, it really Is directed to the

witness because of his report.

He had a copy of that report

more than like?./, a 1 though the record is not clear on this.
Defease .counsel clearly had a copy of the report
at time ox trial, but it is a report that was prepared by the

investigator and it is his report so it really is an order to
the defense counsel or the defense witness to turn over that
report.
QUESTION:

Was this the southern district of

CAlifornia, originaX'jLy?
MR„ FRIEDMAN;

This is the central district of

California.
QUESTION:

Hmn?

MS. FRIEDMAN:

The central district of California.

The trial was in Los Angeles.

QUESTION:

QUESTION;

Maybe he never looked in the Clerk's

Maybe it was there all the time,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Judging from the transcript in -this

case, I sincerely doubt that.
°ur position, basically, is that the cases like
Hfll if. ejau OQgffQh an& Goldman of this Court really support the

v.v v that a trial judge has that kind of discretion in the
absence o.t any countervailing legislation or rule and we say
that there is none.

QUESTION?

Is this :

MR. FRIEDMAN;
yes.

of

reverse Jenka rase?

It is sort of a reverse Jenks case*

And if you look back at Jenks, I think that anyone

would have to agree that Jenks — the Jenks case — began
on the premise that judges have this kind of discretion

in passing the Jenks Act.

wr.s to limit that discretion which existed.

It addressed

itself only to the problem of requiring the Government to
turn over certain things to the defense because it was
concerned with fishing expeditions, national security, things
of that sort of interest, of the Government.
It did not address the problem of this'case at all.
Congro so could address it, but it hasn * t unci we
submit that the Court hasn't addressed it in Rule Id, either,
because Rule 16 is a pretrial rule and it does not really
govern once the trial begins.

bank,
It was those two eye witnesses that the defense
tried to impeach through the investigator»

First? they cross-

examined the eye witnesses asking one whether or not he had
told the investigator that he had only seen the back of the
robber under the camera.
The witness denied having
said it.

The second witness was asked whether or not he had
told the investigator that tc him all blacks lock, alike.
The witness denied having rnib it.

The court indicated its inclination to order them
produced but waited for further oral argument and then later
said that he would order them produced but only after th©
led anc only the relevant \
report and he offered his services en camera to review the
raport and excise extraneous matter.

At what point did the court make this

ruling?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The court made the ruling prior to

the defense investigator being called to. the stand and ha
said that he would require production of relevant portions

The Government proceeded

There was then subsequent

argument at which the Court ruled that if the investigator
was to be called, for this purpose, that the relevant
portions of the report would have to be turned over after
his direct testimony.
Defense counsel. Respondent’s counsel, apparently
then conferred with other members of the public defendar
service and they concluded that there was a Fifth Amendment
privilege and other reasons, Sixth Amendment' privilege, not
to turn this over.
QUESTION:

Before that conferral with other defense

colleagues, the defense counsel had agreed to this, hadn*t

There had been motions for judgment

of acquittal by all o .fonsc counsel.

They had bean denied.

Defence had put on a number of witnesses prior to calling the
investigator and then called the investigator.
The prosecutor asked to approach the bench and said,
I would like a proffer as to what he is going to testify about,.
Defense counsel, Mr. Allis, here, made the proffer
and his proffer was that he would testify about some photo­
graphs taken in the bank, apparently relating to lighting

Hoffman and I believe, also the witness Van Gemerer.

we can rule on this before the witness and X want to know
your intentions.

You are an officer of the court and I am

going to preclude this testimony if you say that you will net

He testified as to other matters.

testified and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
The court of appeals reversed in the two“*to**one

It is in tie safe in Los

I was the trial counsel in this case.

Before the

trial I sent out our investigator, John Bend, to interview
Government witnesses.

It turned out at the trial that the

only evidence against Respondent Robert Lea Nobles was tha
testimony of two eyewitnesses, Van Gsrneren and Hoffman.
The Court of Appeals itself recognised that that
eyewitness testimony was far less impressive than the eye­
witness testimony against the other two defendants.
Tin re was ?, lot of other evidence against taa othsr
two defendants as well.
During

deliberations, the jury had the entire

testimony cf the eyewitness Hoffman read back, to it so that
tfcb jury,also had problems with the eyewitness tastimony but
the defendant was not permitted to put on his most compelling
evidence and that was the evidence that John Bond would have
testified to, that one of the eyewitnesses had told him that
all blacks look alike prior to trial and the otter bad told
Mr that he had only seen the robber frem beh.i ad.

posed of the cotamonlaw rules oil evidence , Rule 16 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Jenks Act.
The Rule 16C of the Federal Rules of Criminal

This document falls within that last sentence in two

41
Now, a trial court judge, has discretion when there
is a rule, tc fill in the gaps to solve problems not con­
sidered by the rule-makers or to interpret text in a manner
which achieves statutory justice.

But as the Court of Appeals

in the Wright case here in the District, of Columbia stated#
this kind of a rule# depending on one’s perspective, would
expand or narrow specific rights and privileges granted by
statute and rule.
QUESTION;

Of course, Judge Craft’s order in the

Wright case was a good deal broader than the District Court's
order here, wasn’t it?
MR. ALLISs
report

Yes, it was, in the sense that the entire

was ordered produced, but it was not ordered produced

until the defense was in its case.
Our contention is that the

basic principles of the

Wright case do indeed apply, that it was an investigator’s
in 'that cats ordered discovered.
Now, Rule 16 is compatible with the underlying
pri nciple of our accusatory system that the Government must
bear the entire burden.
Any suggestion 'chat the Government must have at.
least as good a chance as the Defendant would tc prevail
would seem to violate the basic principis favoring the
Dofondant in order tc avoid.conviction of the innocent.
The other underlying principle of our system which

42

I referred to earlier which is involved in this case and
which certainly influenced ma in refusing to obey -chat court5 s
order was the interest in confidentiality and X might add*
if I may, that although# under ay view of the documents, they
might not have damaged.in.this specific instance# perhaps on
sur-rebuttal# 1£ that was necessary# at, a retrial# if there
were a hung jury# or a

reversed

verdict# if tiara was a rale

like this that had been made and followed during the trial#
what could that mean in terms of my defendant and what I
would have to turn over at c. later trial concerning other
witnesses„
That privilege of confidentiality# this Court has
recognised in the content of Hickman versus Taylor# is
essential in our system of justice.

HistoricalXy# lawyers

have worked as officers of the court to protect •hoi.ni
of their clients.
Wow# tha way that is don©# this Court .-aid in

I think that this certainly would be

much more arguable that something like that could bs pro­

One, it is a scientific kind of a

statement and, number two, it is not a criminal case.

MR, ALLIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Mr. Allis, what do you normally do?

am not talking about you

X

personally, but what do defense

counsel normally do when they send an investigator out?
Do they prefer to have him obtain statements from witnesses,
which is what is customarily done in civil practice, star
xnents that are signed by witnesses and that can be used
affectively to cross-examine witnesses?
Or do you instruct your investigators never to
take a staterasht because the statement might be used against
them but the investigator should write up his own report
which, under your submission hare today, can never ba
used against him.
What is the normal practice?
MR. ALLIS;

I would certain],/ prefer that — and

it is my normal practice to have the investigator get a
written statement signed by the witness ::<x approved by him.
then it is much more effective in examining the. witness.
But 1 think that the problems of the defendant
interviewing Government witnesses is illustrated by this
case.
Herex- the most important Government witness refused
to meet with the investigator,

lly agreed to talk on

MR» ALLIS:

four Honor* bark tellers, after a bank

robbery, in my experience, tend to be prejudiced against
the defendant, assuming that the Government is right in
bringing them to trial.
QUESTION:

Well, they are'prejudiced against the

robber.
MR. ALLIS: . Your Honor, I beg your pardon, pre­
judiced against the robber.
QUESTION:

It depende on whether or not this

defendunt was one of the robbers.

That was the whole issue

here.
MR. ALLIS;

That is correct,

That I am saying is,

is that Government witnesses too often assume that the
Government is right in the a,an they have and therefore
are immediately prejudiced against that man.
That has been one of idle problems in really seeing
that our adversary system works,
i..u oditr: words, rbe adversary system presupposes

theoretically two equally strong sides,

That has not been

true»
This Coart, in Wardius versus Oregon, recognised
that the Government as s£

tX advantages in investi

:ing

a case- but beyond that, there has been a problem with
effective assistance of counsel for defendants,

client and his defendant,

•

a a cornerstone of the criminal justice system and something
paivticuloxly hart to achieve in criminal as opposed to
chril. cares, a 5 going to be afunctad, vc contend, orwa the
defendant sees his counsel giving to the Government material
conceivably favorable to the Government.
Now, the literature is replot::::, cf course, with
instances of do .Pendants not trusting their public da fenders ,r
thinking that those counsel are just another arm of the
Government so the problem of trust act confidence is even
greater because of that.
ii-.e other problem with confidentiality is of course

vaunt outlined in Hickman, the problem of the. investigators
not investigating as thoroughly, not — verhnpr; not writing

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RAUL L. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Just very .briefly.

On. the. Queens case, the purpose- of Rule 16 was to
get rid of the Queans case so that you don’t have to show
it 'to the witness you arc c;:o>r~arai^.iuirg but 1613 applies
equally to oral statements arc. to written craters vty so
that whole argument, we think is not very Sound.

Finally,. I think the point bunt ceme through from
Mr. Justice White ’s l«.3t question, we cull ft "waiver" in
our brief.

If there is a constitutional right involved*

whether it is a Sinth Amendment one cr work product privilege of some sort which we discussed at length in our
reply brief, or the -Fifth Amendment one which we discussed
in our initial brief, refreshing recollection makes no
difference and the kind of discretion we are talking' about
and the trial judge in this case makes no difference*
If there is no constitutional right or whatever
kinds of privileges may exist prior to calling that witness
once the subject is opened up by defers
the same principles of Brown
Raffel, other cases

versus,

counsel himself,
United States,

of this Court make clear that they

cannot open it up only partway»

There Lao got to ba cross-

examination and all We are asking for is a decision of this
-5

trial judges with the kind of discre­

tion they need.

quite all right to keep tie witness off the stand entirely

court

them to ■

duce it.
MR - vilSDafik:

Pli i ant saying is

is that in a

i3~uuatxon -trka tors, where the problem is flagged early

and

nd there can be legalno • have to let the witness

testify a

trike

ises

to turn it over»
If counsel as

an officer of the court says that

ha had made the decision alreay, that he is not going

to

turn it over, if that happens, 1 don’t think the judge has
to permit the direct testimony.
It doesn't come up very often just because of the
normal course, of things, but it happened that way in this
case and it doesn't make any difference in terns of or.r
argument.
