P R GCEEDING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume arguments

in Gulf Oil against Copp Paving,
Mr, Shapero, I think you’re on.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN M, SHAPERO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, SHAPERO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The position of the petitioners, which we heard
yesterday, is represented by two basic concepts, each of which
fail to withstand the test of close analysis.
Their first proposition is that in this case the
issue is not what Congress could do, but what it did do.
The petitioners' position is Congress did not intend to apply
the antitrust laws to builders and suppliers of instrumentalities
of interstate commerce.

That fact standing alone.

This position is incorrect and, in point of fact,
Congress has stated both generally and specifically its intent
that the antitrust laws apply to builders and suppliers of
instrumentalities of interstate commerce.
QUESTION;

Are you speaking in this context or in

other context that you regard as analogous?
MR. SHAPERO:

I’m speaking in this specific context,

and herein we are discussing the specific question of
instrumentalities consisting of interstate highways.

27
QUESTIONS

We.11, but ray question iss

Are you

speaking in the context of antitrust or in others that you
consider analogous to this?
HR. SHAPEROs

1 m speaking specifically of this case,.

Your Honor, and the cases that I have to support it, and the
statutes that I have to support it, I believe are practically
on the button on this particular situation.
Coming to the second proposition, which we believe we
will demonstrate to be in error, is that the term "interstate
highway" has no meaning and is not a term of art.
likewise an incorrect position.

This is

The term "interstate highway"

has; a recognized meaning, both in law and in fact.
The two misconceptions go to the essence of the
petitioners’ case, since it is clear that if Congress did
indeed declare its intent that the antitrust laws apply to
instrumentalities of commerce, and if interstate highways are
clearly understood to be such instrumentalities, then, these
petitioners, as well as our clients, as builders and suppliers
of instrumentalities of interstate commerce' are subject to the
terms and provisions of each and all of the antitrust Acts.
Let us start'with the second proposition first.
Does the term ’’interstate highway" have a meaning?
of art?

Is it a terra

Or is it something which has no significance in terras

of the law or the English language?
It most certainly has a meaning, and that meaning is

28
disclosed by both history and .the statements of this Court.
You can go back, and I bring you old law —. it pays at this
time to go back to the language of Gibbons vs.Ogden.
Justice Marshall speaking, says the subject, to be regulated
is commerce? and our Constitution, being, as was aptly said
at the bar, one of enumeration and not of definition,to
ascertain the extent of the power, it becomes necessary to
settle the meaning of the word.
The counsel for the appellee would limit it to
traffic, to buying and selling or to the interchange of
commodities, .and do not admit that it comprehends navigation.
This would restrict a general term applicable to
many objects to one of its significations.

Commerce

undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is
intercourse, it describes the commercial intercourse between
nations and parts of nations, in all its branches, and is
regulated by proscribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.
The mind can scarcely conceive a system for
regulating commerce between nations, which shall exclude all
laws concerning navigation which shall be silent on the
admission of the vessels of the one nation into the forts, of
the other and be confined to prescribing rules for the conduct
of the individuals in the actual employment of buying and
selling or barter.
Perhaps the most striking example of the close and

29

intimate, intertwining relationship between interstate
commerce on the one hand and the instrumentalities of inter­
state commerce on the other is the feet, that the very first
Commission in this country, which was formed to establish
and control

which was established to control the railroads

-- it was not called a Railroad Commission, and it was not even
called a Transportation Commission; it was called the Inter­
state Commerce Commissions
And no bne,

certainly, at this stage in our develop­

ment, would deny that the authority of the federal government
to control the railroads, under the commerce power, as an
instrumentality of interstate commerce does not exist.
And what is the relationship, then, between inter­
state highways to interstate commerce?
We're now approaching the case at bar.

As Professor

Scharfman, in his work on the Interstate Commerce Commission,
states as follows, quote, "The railroad industry is no more
than a century old and the motor carriers and water lines,
whose increasingly severe competition it has been encountering
in recent years, are but the modern counterparts of the turn­
pikes and canals which .it largely displaced, at the time of
its first emergence, as an improved source of transportation
service.
Justice Murphy, speaking for this Court, in Overstreet
vs. North Shore Corporation, declared as follows, quote;

30

"We think the practical test should govern here,
vehicular roads and bridges are as indispensable to the
interstate movement of persons and goods a© railroad tracks
and bridges are to interstate transportation.

If they are

used by persons and goods passing between various States,
they are instrumentalities of interstate coramerce„"
Justice Black, speaking in AIstats vs * Durkin, put
the matter thusly, quote:
"In Overstreet we pointed out that the interstate
roads and railroads are indispensable instrumentalities in
the carriage of persons and goods that move in commerce."
What's the retort of the petitioners?

The retort is

that in those cases they were talking about labor laws,
fair labor standards, and here we're talking about another
kind of statute.

But let us look at the Highway Act itself.

The Highway Act, which is 23 United States Code,
section 103.

In the Highway Act we have described a federal

primary system, a federal secondary system, a federal-aid
urban system, and, lastly, the interstate system, which the
Congress, in the Highway Act, defines as follows, and I'm
quoting:
"The interstate system shall be designated within
the United States, including the District of Columbia, and
except as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection,
it shall not exceed 41,000 miles in total extent. It shall be

31

located as to connect by routes as direct as practicable the
principal metropolitan areas, cities and industrial centers,
to serve the national defense and, to the greatest extent
possible, to connect at suitable border points with routes of
continental importance in the Dominion of Canada and the
Republic of Mexico.

The routes of this system, to the

greatest extent possible, shall be selected by joint action
of the State highways departments of each State and the
adjoining States, subject to the approval by the Secretary as
provided in subsection (e) of this section.”
We come to the case at hand.
The language which we consider critical was contained
in the stipulation which we entered into very early in this
case.

And the stipulation, as set forth by the trial court,

reads as follows, quote:
"A more than de minimis quantity of asphaltic
concrete delivered by plaintiffs and their competitors is
delivered for use on interstate highways."
That's contained in the record, in the Appendix to
the Respondents' brief, at page 3.
I submit this to you, that the Petitioners, at the
time they entered into that stipulation, well understood the
distinction and meaning and the clear — the clear meaning of
what was intended and what is intended in law by the phrase
"interstate highway".

32

As stated in the Respondents' complaint, at page
17 and 13 of the Appendix — I'm quoting now from the record,
in the Appendix, quote;
"Defendants Gulf, Union and Edgington sell to end
users and contractors, including plaintiffs, substantial
quantities of hot asphalt oil to be used as hot asphalt or as
asphaltic concrete for constructing, maintaining, surfacing,
resurfacing and repairing roads and highways, including
Federal interstate system highways and highways directly
connected to interstate highways."
How did the Petitioners respond to that?

They

admitted --- they admitted those very phrases.
How, I can represent to the Court ■—
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapero, —

MR. SHAPE RO;
QUESTIONi
MR. SHAPERO;

Yes?
~~

is tliat all conceded, do you think?
It is conceded.

And that is exactly

the next point that I was coming to, Hr. Justice Blackmun.
It is conceded, and they admit that .indeed they did apply
this to interstate highways.
The Petitioners clearly understood at that point,
and my point is that by making the concession they must have
understood the distinction between interstate highways and
roads, which are merely funded by federal money, when they
entered into the stipulation.

Otherwise the stipulation makes

33

no sense whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapero, would you think that, the

suppliers of raw material, who furnish the sand and the gravel
and the binder to Copp Paving, would be in interstate commerce?
MR. SHAPERO:

If — to the extent that the

particular supplies are going on an interstate facility, I
would say yes, Your Honor, they are.
QUESTION: Well, let's take a hypothetical case, a
specific one:

Copp calls whoever the supplier is, or writes

them, to make the evidence more definite, and says, We have a
big contract to resurface Interstate Highway No. 81 for 23
miles, all inside of California; we request you to submit bids
for — and lists the following .items:

sand, gravel, whatever

else they put into this asphaltic cement.
MR. SIIAPERO':
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Is he in interstate commerce?

MR. SIIAPERO:

I believe that he is, and I believe

that the Congress has so stated and intended that they be so
considered. And that will be ny next point that I would point
out to the Court, where Congress has indeed expressed its
specific intent in the very limited area -- in that very
limited area, it has reference to the specific instrumentalities
of interstate commerce.
So that I'm not talking in this case about a big
spread or a wide expansion of the reach of the antitrust laws,

34

because I must remind the Court, at all times, that we1 re
talking about interstate —- an interstate instrumentality*
So that we’re talking about an expansion within a very, very
confined area of the lew*
But within that confined area, Congress has expressed
its intent, which I will come to shortly, with your permission.
To continue my points

To enter into the stipulation,

which they've entered into, that the amount of asphaltic
concrete delivered by the Petitioner and their competitors
would, by definition, mean that all the paving — if we would
take the stipulation as it's interpreted by the Petitioners,
it would mean that the amount of asphaltic concrete delivered
by the Petitioner and their competitors, which would, by
definition, mean all the paving done in Southern California
was more than de minimis, this would simply be entering into
a nonsense stipulation*
Because the terms of the stipulation would mean that
we would be stipulating that all the pavers, the total industry
in Southern California is producing all the roads in Southern
California, and that all that activity is more than de minimis.
The stipulation simply has no meaning whatsoever unless you
are confining it to the specific reference of the interstate
instrumentality*
Now, the Petitioners, I would submit they knew
better than -this when they entered into the stipulation, and

35

their pleadings and their understanding was that at the time
that the pleadings were drawn, at the time that we entered
into the stipulation, that vie were tracking the use, we were
actually tracking statutory language.

And the statutory

language we were tracking and the statutory language which, as
Justice Blackmun points out, they admitted was the specific
statutory language sat forth in the Highway Act itself.
And their inability at this point to understand the
meaning of that phrase "interstate highway” is no more than an
attempt, I would submit, to remove themselves from one portion
of a syllogistic box which they find themselves in.
Now, let’s turn to the first issue which still
remains.

Did the Congress express the intent to do that which

it had the power to do, namely, apply the Antitrust Acts to
instrumentalities of commerce, namely, interstate highways,
within the meaning of that phrase as we have now demonstrated
the phrase has a meaning?
The Clayton Act itself expresses the congressional
purpose and intent.

.And in reference to the instrumentalities

as they existed at the time of the passage of tine Clayton
Act in 1941, at that time the development of highways had not
yet occurred, but the intent of the Congress to control and
apply antitrust legislation to the builders and suppliers of
the instrument -- of the interstate instrumentalities was
clear; and it was done.

36

And it was done even in view of the fact that the
railroads were natural monopolies„
Now, the specific language is contained in section
10 of the Clayton Act,, and that's one -- that’s the primary
Act that we're concerned with»

And Section 10 of the Clayton

Act says that no common carrier engaged in commerce shall
have any dealings in securities, supplies, or other articles
of commerce, or shall have any contracts for construction or
maintenance of any kind to the amount of more than $50,000
in the aggregate in any one year with another corporation,
firm, partnership, or association, when said common carrier
shall have upon its board of directors or as its president,
manager, or its purchasing or selling officer, or agent in
the particular transaction, any person who is at the same
time a director, manager, purchasing or selling officer, or
who has any substantial interest in such other corporation,
firm, partnership, or association unless and except such
purchases shall be made from or such dealings shall be with
the bidder whose bid is the most favorable to such common
carrier, to be ascertained by competitive bidding under the
regulations to be prescribed by the rules or otherwise by the
Interstate Commerce Commission,
And it states further:

any person

this is contained within ‘the Clayton Act itself

any personi
any person

who shall directly or indirectly do or attempt to do anything

37
to prevent anyone, from bidding or shall do any act to prevent
free and fair competition among the bidders of those desiring
to bid shall be punished as prescribed in tills section, as in
the case of an officer or director»
So that, in reference to the construction of the
railroads, I think the intent of Congress is spelled out
perfectly clear, .in referring to the question that you put,
Mr» Chief Justice.
That here we have a specific intent of the Congress»
We have a statement by the Petitioners that if 'the Congress
declared its intent, they would certainly have the power to do
so.

Here we have a specific intent set forth by the Congress»
Now, the next question, of course, immediately is;

Well, that’s all very well and good, but that was in reference
to the railroads.

That had nothing whatsoever to do with the

highways.
We have the same specific intent which is set forth
by the Congress within the Highway Act, and they discussed
these in terns of maintaining competition.
Now I might state that this Court, in a unanimous
opinion ~~ in a unanimous opinion, written by Justice Douglas,
stated -that the section that I just quoted from is an Antitrust
Act.

And Mr. Justice Douglas used the following language,

quotes
”It is pointed out that the railroad scandals of that

3H
age were not limited to interlocking directors and multiple
shareholders, but that suppliers of railroad materials had
made substantial gifts to the railroad officials with whom
they dealt*"
With the railroads at that time, at least you had
— at least you had, in theory at any rate, where you had an
independent entrepreneur, and he was acquiring supplies for
his road, he had at least the impulse, and,unless there was
a conflict of interest, the desire to hold the prices down„
But where you're dealing with public highways, who, I would
ask the Court, is the entrepreneur who is going to protect
the public under those circumstances?
And the Congress answered that question*

And the

Congress declared that their vote and their position was
going to be that the protector of the public under those
circumstances would be competition; and they've stated so*
And they've stated so specifically.
They stated, under letting of contracts
now referring to section, to 23 section 112:

and I'm

The Secretary

shall require, as a condition precedent to his approval of
each contract awarded by competitive bidding, pursuant to
subsection (b) of this section, and subject to the provisions
of this section, a sworn statement executed by or on behalf
of the person from an association or corporation to whom such
contract is to be awarded, certifying that such person, firm,

39

association, or corporation has not, either directly or
indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any
collusion, or otherwise taken any action in restraint of free
competitive bidding in connection with such contracts»
How, that is a clear statement of congressional
intent.
They've stated it even further, at section 304»
This is 23 section 304 of the Highway Act»

It statess

It is declared to be in the national interest to encourage
and develop the actual and potential capacity of small business
and to utilise this important segment of our economy to the
fullest practicable extent in construction of the federal
highway systems, including the interstate system.
Now, what's the answer of the petitioners to this?
They say these aren't directives.

That it's within the power

of the State to ignore each one of these items if they so
choose.

All they have to do is forego the federal funds.

Arid this, I would submit to you is introducing a new
doctrine that, unlike death, taxes are no longer inevitable.
All you have to do is give up income.

Because the fundamental

facts of life are, today in the United States, that the money
that's available for idle construction of highways is available
through the federal government.
And that's the only way -that these highways are going
to be constructed.

40
QUESTION*

Let's assume, Mr. Shapero, that some

State gats some strong notion of independence and says, We
don't want any federal money, we'll build this extension, we'll
cooperate, we'll build this extension with our own money„
Do I understand you to say that -the source of the
money is the key factor?
MR* SHAPERO:

No, no, absolutely not»

And that

doctrine has already been considered and rejected by the
Courto
The source of the money does not give the federal
government the power»

The power comes from the fact that the.

particular highway is, itself, an integral part of the
interstate process.
All that I'm stating is that this is a designation
and a recitation of what the congressional intent was.
The intent to apply the antitrust laws to the interstate -to an interstate construction of highways.

Because, certainly,

in terras of the protection of the public., the advantages and
the necessity for having competition is just as strong if it’s
paid for by the State of California as if the particular
highway is paid for by the federal government.
We still need the same protection. And that is the
fundamental purpose of these statutes and why they are
essential as far as the construction of the highways are
concerned.

Because the competition has the ability of

41
eliminating

and I put chicanery aside»

And by putting it

aside, I don't say that it. doesn't exist; but I put it aside.
The other factors, what becomes a proper measure of
profit; what formulas do you use?

All these matters are

eliminated automatically by the presence of competition, and.
we have the clear expression of Congress, which states that
what the Congress is looking for is not

in the construction

of the highway, what they’re looking for is not so much that
when they want to build a highway, they don't, want to look to
a company, they want, to look, to have the ability of looking
to an industry in order to build that highway.
And in order to do it, they have declared that we
must maintain the integrity in full competition.
Now, the extent there’s been — that was some
discussion yesterday that was put in terms of the extent to
which the federal government had participated and the extent
to which the federal government had made contributions, and
vie have — the record is very full with specific references
as to the extent of the federal contribution that we have made.
For example, at page 172 of the Appendix, T invite your
attention to examining the fact that in one year, for example,
$294 million went into the national system of interstate and
defense highways in California alone, for the year 1972-73.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapero, —

MR. SHAPERO:

Yes?

42
QUESTION:

— may I interrupt you for a minute?

Are you arguing that these transactions had an effect on
commerce?
MR. SHAPERO:

This is not an affect case.

We are

in commerce.
QUESTION s

Right.

You do net reflect on the

effects?
MR. SHAPEROs
QUESTION:

We don't rely on the effect, Doctor.
Right.

MR. SHAFERO:

This is an in commerce case.

QUESTION: And the District Court found there was
no proof of the effect on commerce in this case?
MR. SIIAPERO:

Well, the District Court never

considered the problem specifically.

The District Court ruled

that there was no effect on commerce and therefore threw out
all of the Acts.

It made no distinction when it ruled, it

threw out everything because it failed to find an effect on
commerce under the Sherman Act.
And since the Sherman Act fell, then it ruled that
all four of the Acts fell.

So that the District Court made

no distinction whatsoever.
I might say that I think you have an effect on
commerce, almost as a matter of law, by the very language
of the District Court itself, where it spelled out that we
already have 75 percent ~~ and this is from the opinion of

43
the District Court, that we have 75 percent of the road
construction in Southern, California now being built by two
parties:

Industrial and Sully-Miller.

Bach of which are

owned, in turn, by two large oil companies:

Gulf and Industrial»

So that we are already approaching an effect doctrine
because the court, the trial court, again in the trial court
opinion, says that where you have a monopoly you presumably
would have such an effect,

And we are approaching already, by

our trial court’s own findings, such a monopoly situation,
QUESTION;

You're supporting the Court of Appeals

reasoning and its opinion.
MR. SHAPERO:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
In contradistinction with the reasoning

in the government’s amicus brief, aren't you?
MR* SHAPERO;

That is correct, Your Honor,

Thank you very kindly,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Lasky?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MOSES LASKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. LASKY;

Yes, if the Court please.

Mr», Chief Justice., if the Court please:
In the few moments that I have, I would like to note
the consequences of this argument that's just been made.
What is called Interstate Highway 480 is a stretch

44

of street in San Francisco of about twelve blocks in length,
running from the so-called Barbery Coast.
If a man should pick up a woman there, or abduct
her and carry her, for purposes of prostitution, over those
twelve blocks, under this argument you've just heard, that
man would have violated the Dyer Act, the Mann Act, and the
Lindbergh Kidnapping Act.

Because he would have transported

a kidnapped person in a stolen automobile, if he had a stolen
automobile, in interstate commerce.
Now, the only other thing I wish to say is on the
subject of effect.

The District Court, in its opinion, which

is printed as an Appendix to our Petition for Certiorari, on
page 6, discusses the subject and concludes:
”1 conclude that the local activities of the
defendants with regard to asphaltic concrete did not have a
substantial impact on interstate commerce,"
Counsel has said this is not an impact or effect
case, and he's relying on the arbitrary notion that because
asphaltic concrete went into a road that's part of a «■- that
connects with other roads that crosses a Stats line, it is
in interstate commerce.
And with that submission, he has largely abandoned
the bulk of his own brief, which was an argument along the
lines of that of the Solicitor General.
I submit the case.

Thank you.

45
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:34 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
