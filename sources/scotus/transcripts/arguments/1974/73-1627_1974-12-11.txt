MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear argument

next in 73-1627, LefJcowitz against Newsome,
Mr. Hammer, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. HAMMER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, HAMMER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The issue presented by this case is the exact

same issue which the Court reserved to itself in the case of
McMann v. Richardson, 397 U,S, at footnote 13 of the opinion.
That question is whether the Federal habeas corpus remedy is
available to a defendant who pleads guilty but is permitted
under State law to appeal the denial of a pretrial motion to
suppress evidence.
In February of 1970 Mr. Newsome was arrested for
loitering.

Loitering is a violation carrying a maximum of 15

days imprisonment sentence.

Incidental to this loitering

arrest, Mr. Newsome was searched, and it appears that on his
person were concealed narcotics and narcotic implements.

So

that he was also charged with the crime of possession of a
dangerous drug.

This was a class A misdemeanor carrying a

maximum one year’s imprisonment.
A trial on the loitering charge was combined with a
pretrial motion to suppress the evidence.

The defendant

contended that the loitering arrest which predicated the

4
incidental search was invalid, that the loitering statute was
unconstitutionally vague.
The lower criminal court denied this motion and
convicted him of loitering.

At that point, in May of 1970,

the defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted
possession of a dangerous drug and he was sentenced to three
months imprisonment which was the maximum on so-called class 3
misdemeanors.
At that point, under what was then section 813(c)
of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, he appealed.

He

was at larged on bail and has remained free ever since.
QUESTION?

And what do you appeal from — the

loitering conviction as well as the other one?
MR. HAMMER;

He appealed from both the loitering

conviction and the conviction of attempted possession of a
dangerous drug.
QUESTION:

Is that a — at least it’s novel to me --

is that what you —
MR. HAMMER:

It's perhaps a theoretical offense.

I should point out, your Honor, that the New York Court of
Appeals has allowed this as a plea bargaining device in a case
of so-called attempted manslaughter so that while there are
certain theoretical problems with such a charge, for purposes
of pleading to a reduced charge, the New York courts uphold
such an arrangement.

QUESTION;
York.

We have seen it quite frequently in New

I never see it anywhere else,, attempted possession and

attempted manslaughter when indeed there is conceded that there
was a killing and so on.
MR. HAMMER:

This was, as I pointed out, a vehicle,

for allowing a plea for a reduced charge.
QUESTION;
MR. HAMMER:

Right.
I should point out, your Honor, that

there are analogous provisions of the now criminal procedural
laws to permit the review of convictions where there has been
a pretrial motion to suppress a confession or to invalidate
an identification under the Wade rules.
QUESTION;

What’s open on that appeal so far as the

Appellate Division of the Court of Appeals is concerned?
MR. HAMMER:

The appellate court may review the

denial of the suppression motion, notwithstanding the plea
of guilty.

This is the only issue before the Court on such

an appeal.
QUESTION;

What does it do if it decides that the

decision on the suppression motion was erroneous?

Does it

reverse the denial of the motion or does it reverse -the
conviction?
MR. HAMMER:

The appellate court reverses the

conviction, Mr. Justice Rahnquist.
QUESTION:

Is this procedure open if the defendant

6

made no motion to suppress?
MR. HAMMER:
suppress be made.

The statute requires that a motion to

Otherwise —

QUESTION s

And overrule.

MR. HAMMER:

And overrule.

Otherwise, there is no

right to take an appeal and the matter is waived even at a
trial should the defendant plead not guilty.
QUESTION:

I gather in this case when that went up

to the Appellate Division —
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Appellate Term, your Honor.
Appellate Term, the decision turned on

the issue of constitutionality of a loitering statute did it?
MR. HAMMER:
issue.

The Appellate Term never reached that

It decided the loitering conviction was bad on non-

constitutional grounds, that there was insufficient evidence
to convict and that the information itself charging the
offense was defective.
QUESTION:

And did it also decide the motion to

suppress xvas improperly overruled?
MR. HAMMER:

No, your Honor.

It held that the arrest

was made on probable cause so that the incidental search was
upheld.

And for this reason the conviction was affirmed.

At that point a certificate for leave to appeal to the Court
of Appeals was sought and denied, and this Court itself in
February 1972 denied a petition for certiorari.

7
QUESTION;

Let me ask you one other question.

Suppose he made his motion to suppress and it was denied but
he didn’t appeal ill the State system.

Is it your position

that this is still open on Federal habeas?
MR. HAMMER:

If the defendant had then gone on to

trial and was convicted after a trial, we would have a totally
different situation.

Our contention is that it's the plea of

guilty which forms the barrier to Federal collateral review.
QUESTION:

But it doesn’t form a barrier to State

review.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

It’s our contention --

It’s a created State review, created by

the State.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Exactly.
Noitf the State says that because of that

he can’t use the Federal courts.
MR, HAMMER:

Your Honor, under Lego v. Tworn-ay the

States are always free to be more generous than the Federal
Constitution requires.

And this, we suggest, is what happened.

The State legislature enacted a statute designed exclusively
for the internal management of the State criminal law procedure.
They have permitted an appeal under the circumstances of this
case.

But we insist with all respect, your Honor, that such

a statute cannot under any circumstances enlarge the jurisdictio
of the United States District Court, only Congress can.
*

8

QUESTION z

Do you think there is any validity in

your opponent’s argument about this being a trap for the unwary?
MR. HAMMER:

No, your Honor.

point is not well taken.

I suggest -that their

At the outset it should be emphasized

that the State Attorney General’s office, at least, has never
conceded the issue that section 813 appeal automatically gives
a defendant the right, if he is unsuccessful, to go into the
Federal district court.

We have resisted it in Rogers, we have

petitioned for certiorari before, if I am not mistaken.

We

have insisted that all 813-c does is promise a State appeal,
and, of course, the State delivered on that promise.
QUESTION:

X presume if we reverse the judgment of

the Court of Appeals, at least it will thereafter be no trap
for the unwary.
MR. HAMMER:

Absolutely.

I should add, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that what is
involved here is no different than when good, competent
counsel may miscalculate upon the effect of, or mispredict
what a higher court will do.

From the outset, as I mentioned

before, our office has always insisted that the Federal habeas
corpus remedy may not be maintained where a defendant enters
a provident, voluntary plea of guilty.
what we have here.

And this is precisely

There is no dispute that the plea was

voluntary, and I submit that it was quite provident in view of
the fact that this defendant when charged with an offense

9
carrying a possible one-year sentence was able to bargain it
down to three months.

So regardless of the legal point raised

on the motion to suppress, we have here a plea of guilty which
stands independently.
The district court originally dismissed the Federal
proceeding.

The case was remanded to it under the authority

of this Court's decision in Kensly.

As we pointed outP the

district court granted the writ on the theory that the
loitering statute was unconstitutionally vague, citing the
New York Court, of Appeals decision in People v. Berek.

They

did not, the district court did not, discuss our defense
that it lacked jurisdiction because of the guilty plea.
In January of this year we argued the matter before
the Second Circuit and that court was urged to reconsider its
line of cases in Rogers on the authority of Me .Mann and Toilet.
We pointed out to the Second Circuit that in the case of
Mann v. Smith, decided a few months previously by the Ninth
Circuit, that court had conformed its decision to the Toilet
ruling and we urgedthat Rogers had been overruled in essence
by Toilet.

However, that court, in our view, erroneously

adhered to its own rule and permitted the habeas corpus
remedy to be maintained.
We submit, your Honors, that the decisions of this
Court in McMann, in Toilet, and more recently in Blackledge v.
Perry, have set forth a firm rule that the conviction based

10

upon a voluntary provident plea of guilty is immune from
Federal collateral attack on all Federal constitutional claims
except those relating to the right of the State to bring the
defendant to trial.
QUESTION:

Can you read McMann as relying on the

fact that under the State procedure this was final; the guilty
plea?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

We submit, your Honor —
Was that true (inaudible)

MR. HAMMER:

As I understand the McMann plea, your

Honor, McMann's plea -~
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Waived everything in the State court.
That's correct.
And that's not true here.

He didn't waive

his attack on the suppression.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

In McMann, of course -But isn’t that a different -—
Of course, in McMann the Court reserved

the precise question that wa have at bar today.

Nevertheless,

towards tne end of the opinion, the Court set forth, and I
would submit

in fairly sweeping and absolute terns, that the

plea of guilty is final whether there be a right to appeal
the suppression motion or not.

If there were any doubt, I

submit it’s been resolved by Toilet and by Blackledge.
QUESTION:

That even where the State changes its

11
whole procedure;, the State could not by any means create a
situation where you couldn’t get habeas corpus.
MR, HAMMER:
QUESTION;

Didn't go that far.

MR. HAMMER:
is not relevant.

Of course# your Honor# the State --

The State's procedure# I would submit#

This is not a waiver case.

The defendant

didn't waive —■ we don't say the defendant waived his right
to Federal habeas corpus in the sense of he knowingly gave it
up.

lie never had a right to Federal habeas corpus once he

pleaded guilty.

We are not speaking of knowing waiver.

QUESTION:

What case do you have for that?

MR. HAMMER:

Well# we have Toilet.

Toilet points out

that there is the break in the chain of events.
QUESTION:

Toilet didn't have this type of statute.

MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That may be so# your Honor.
That's my only point,- did this statute

create a different ■—
MR. HAMMER:

All the statute created# your Honor#

was a right to a State appeal.

It did not, in our submission,

extend and could not possibly extend a Federal remedy.
QUESTION:

Couldn't you therefore say that this

conviction is not in and of itself nonappealable?
just the opposite.

It said

It said it was appealable.

MR. HAMMER:

That's correct, your Honor, notwithstanding

the plea of guilty# appealable in the State courts.

12

QUESTION:

I take it your point is that McMann and

Toilet didn't turn on anybody voluntarily giving up a claim
to habeas corpus but rather on the fact that after you
pleaded guilty and admitted the substantive elements of the
offense, as a matter of Federal law you're not entitled to
raise afterwards certain claims on habeas.
MR. HAMMER:

That is precisely our contention, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

So it has nothing to do with whether

New York grants an appeal by statute.
MR. HAMMER:

Precisely.

The State legislature never

considered the problem and, indeed, they could not by its
own legislative action possibly affect it.

This is the

province of Congress and this Court in interpreting the mandates
of Congress.
QUESTION:

I take it you are saying that the State

position is that sustaining the position you urge today would
not subvert the legislative aims of New York in providing this
appeal of suppression motion.
MR. HAMMER;

Absolutely.

The legislative aims of

New York are merely to grant a State appeal, no more, no less.
This is precisely what the State gives.

QUESTION:

And l suppose the policy underlying the matt

at least one of them is to eliminate a lot of not guilty
pleas that are unnecessary in a lot of trials that are

13
unnecessary.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION?

That's correct.
A person's only defense, in other words,

his basic only defense,' is the fourth amendment claim that can
be put to one side and he can plead guilty to everything else,
is that it?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
And your view is, I know, that our

agreeing with you in this case wouldn't subvert that policy,
although it's arguable that it would, wouldn’t it, because
it would cause more,arguably, would cause more not guilty
pleas in the State system.
MR. HAMMER:

I suggest, your Honor, that there is

absolutely no evidence in the record that this would be the
case,
QUESTION:

Well, .it's not a matter of evidence and

you don't know the answer and I don’t either, but all we can
do is guess and speculate.
MR. HAMMER:

I think, your Honor, if we have to

speculate, the answer has to be in the negative.

I don't

think that most defendants speculate about the possibility of
a Fedex-al habeas corpus proceeding several years hence.

1

think it can be shown statistically, although I don't have
the studies at ray fingertips, that there are more, much more,
State defendants who appeal through the State system whether

14
they plead guilty or not guilty than those seeking Federal
habeas corpus.
QUESTION;

It. wasn't the real reason for the plea

bargaining, was it?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION;

Precisely.

That's what you said, I think.

MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION;

In this instance, I think it can be —
No, I mean the statute itself.

MR. HAMMER;

— it can be demonstrated that it was

provident, the plea was provident because the man reduced his
exposure to imprisonment from one year to three months.
QUESTION;

And the State would save the expense

and trouble of a trial.
MR, HAMMER:
QUESTION;

Precisely.
Whose view are we supposed to take a3 to

the legislative purpose or expectation —- yours or the Court of
Appeals for -die Second Circuit?

The Court of Appeals for the

Second Circuit, as I understand it, believes that to snuff out
Federal habeas in these situations would subvert the legislative
aim of the statute.
MR. HAMMER;
opinion below.

Wouldn't it?

Isn't that his position?

That is essentially the gist of the

I would submit, however, that

QUESTION;

Well, now, it certainly happens that

the Federal court has to decide what it believes the statute
means and it isn't necessarily bound by the views of the Attorney

15

General of New York.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, we don't —How about us?

What you are really asking

us to review here, in a part of.it anyway, is what does the
State statute mean or what is behind it.
MR. HAMMER:

The legislative intent, of course, we

contend will not affect the jurisdiction of the district
court, and tile legislature couldn’t do it.

But I would suggest,

your Honor, that the whole purpose of these statutes was to
provide a statutory remedy to enforce the mandate of this
Court in cases such as Jackson v. Denno with respect to
confessions, Mapp v. Ohio with respect to suppression of
physical evidence, and Wade, Gilbert, and Stovall with respect
to identifications.
Under the circumstances, the legislature had no
concern with either extending or constricting the Federal
habeas corpus remedy.

It itfas none of their business,

Just

with all respect, I —
QUESTION :

Is that to say the inquiry as to what

their purpose was is irrelevant to the issue here.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
That the issue here is if Toilet is to

be read as you suggested, the plea of guilty foreclosed on
the search and seizure issue any resort to Federal habeas,
whatever may have been the case and whatever reason the New

16

York legislation wanted to do it, that if the one who pled
guilty wants to do it, he may take the suppression issue on
appeal to the appellate court.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Precisely, your Honor,
Did you want to answer Justice Brennan

first?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

I answered him, Mr. Chief Justice.
Is there, so far as New York is concerned

and the prosecution problem,a policy question that this statute
gives the prosecutor greater flexibility to deal, for example,
with first offenders or less offensive cases by this device
of attempted possession?
MR. HAMMER:

I think in practical terms this is the

net effect.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't be likely to do tills with

a man who had had three prior convictions for possession of
heroin as much as you would a 20-year-old fellow who was up
on a first offense.
MR. HAMMER:

I should think not, your Honor.

But

then, this would be in the particular discretion of the
individual district attorney.

There might be other mitigating

factors.
QUESTION:

My point is there is a policy factor

possibly lurking here to give the prosecutor this greater
discretion.

17
MR. HAMMER:

Such a view, I think, is perfectly

consistent with the statute.
QUESTIONi

We submit, your Honors —*

I gather — am I right? — that after

this case, I guess it was then Judge Breitel denied leave to
appeal, wasn't it, from —
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And after that the Berck case was cited,

wasn't it, which declared the loitering statute unconstitu­
tional on Federal constitutional grounds, wasn't it?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
By that time he was out of luck, he

couldn't, he had no way of getting ™ or is coram nobis
available?
MR. HAMMER:

No, your Honor,

coram nobis would not

be available because, although —
QUESTION:

He has no resort to take advantage of

Berck at all, does he?
MR. HAMMER:

I should think so, because had he been

convicted of loitering, the State Court of Appeals decision
in People v♦ Tannenbaum would have required a retroactive
application of the substantive law.

However, in this instance

we are dealing not with a substantive law but with an. issue
of suppression of evidence and the effect of —
QUESTION:

Well, anyway, the loitering conviction

on a different ground was satisfied.

18
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor»
What about this:

Suppose there is an

appeal of a suppression motion that5 s been denied and a plea
of guilty and then an appeal on the suppression issue, in the
State system, as the Mew York lav; permits, and it’s decided
one way or another in the Court of Appeals of Hew York*
assume that.

Let’s

Does petition for cart lie here?

MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Of course.

It’s under section 1257,

Assume a denial of the suppression issue

is affirmed, and you think the defendant at that point can
petition for cert here.
MR. HAMMER:

Of course, because of this Court's

jurisdiction to review the decisions of the highest State court
in which the issue could revert.
QUESTION:

We would take jurisdiction of that case

although v;e would say a district court would not.
MR. HAMMER:

That’s correct, because the statute

gives this Court the right to hear the case, whereas it is our
submission that the statute denies the district court, the right
to hear it on collateral attack simply because the plea of
guilty eliminates any case or controversy within the jurisdic­
tion of that court.
I don’t know if I have any time remaining, Mr.
Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have a few minutes

19

if you wish to reserve it.
MR. HAMMER:

With the permission of the Court, I

should.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Hammer.

Mr. Neustadter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY NEUSTADTER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NEUSTADTER:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I hope you won't think it overly blunt

for me to state something rather firmly at the outset.

I

think a reversal here would require this Court to put a
revolutionary gloss on a very stodgy concept of waiver.
The petitioner, although he hasn't used the magic word "waiver"
is essentially asking you to find waiver in an unprecedented
context, a context unlike all other cases where there has been
some sort of default, some sort of lapse, some sort of
relinquishment.

Petitioner is asking you to find waiver of

a constitutional claim in this case and the opportunity to
vindicate that claim under the habeas corpus statute, even
though he has fully litigated that claim in perfect and
timely accord with every inch and paragraph of State statute,
and it seems to me rather anomalous that it could achieve that
result.

Then the petitioner attributes this waiver of habeas

corpus vinciation to a guilty plea, automatically,saying the
guilty plea dispatches

Federal habeas remedies.

And this is

20

the same guilty plea that there is not waived under State
lav/ State appellate review of the pre-plea order denying the
motion to suppress.

It is the same guilty plea which petitioner

conceded at page 13 of his brief and just reiterated the
concession to Mr. Justice White it does not waive certiorari
prerogative, yet we are told that the same plea waives the
mandatory statutory relief provided by Congress in the habeas
corpus statute.
QUESTION;

You don't agree with Mr. Hammer, then,

that the States may be more generous without suffering any
penalty for it.
MR. NEUSTADTER;

No, the States can always foe more

generous in terms of defining the parameters of constitutional
rights as, I'd say, under the aegis of State constitutions.
The Second Circuit and Federal court in the Second
Circuit jurisdiction, has not extended or enlarged Federal
jurisdiction on the ambit of habeas corpus solely for New York
petitioners.

That's the suggestion in petitioner's brief and

reiterated again here.

The constant for habeas corpus relief

is simply that the constitutional finding foe presented to
State court by whatever procedures the State court has erected
for that purpose.

Having done so, if he is unsuccessful and

if he finds himself in custody claiming a violation of a
constitutional right which led to the conviction, he has met
the threshold jurisdictional requirement to habeas

21

Such is the posture of my client when he came into Federal
court.
QUESTION s

...

McMann, there had been a

pretrial suppression motion that had been denied# the present
New York statute not being in existence, and then a guilty plea.
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Well, that would have put it in

exactly the posture of this case.

If the defendants in

Richardson had appealed, in other words, had

813-c

existed

for the defendants in Richardson at the time that they entered
their plea, had they litigated their confession issue in the
pretrial procedure under 813-c, had they then pleaded guilty,
pursued their appellate remedies as allowed by 813-c -QUESTION:

My question is, prior to 813-c, what if

they litigated it in a trial court, lost, and then pleaded
guilty?
MR. NEUSTADTER:

And pleaded during the trial?

Under

State law at that time, State appellate review of that
confession claim would have been lost.
QUESTION:

No.

The question is would Federal habeas

have been —
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION :

Yes.

Then that

..

would be

contrary to McMann.
MR. NEUSTADTER: No, no.
your question.

Perhaps I misunderstood

22
QUESTIONs

Let rae repeat the question, if I may.

Prior to the enactment of 8I3~c, New York State
court defendant moved to suppress evidence in the trial court,
motion denied, plead guilty, that's the end of the proceedings
in the State court.

Does he have access to Federal habeas?

MR. NEUSTADTERs

No, he does not.

He does not,

because in order to preserve the issue in pre-813-c cases,
such as McMann, he would have to litigate that issue at trial.
If he pleads, he's foregoing the possible remedy of that
constitutional claim, because trial in a non-813-c concept,
trial is the only way to litigate that issue, and if you
forego the trial, you haven't preserved it as a threshold
issue, you therefore can't seek to vindicate it on appeal
within State court, and you therefore bypass the orderly
procedures which the State has erected for the vindication of
that claim, and you no longer — you have dispensed with your
prerogative to invoke habeas corpus vindication.
QUESTION:

You see McMann and Toilet, then, as turning

on a notion of waiver within the State system.
MR.NEUSTADTER:

That is correct, within the context

of State procedural rules which set up the requirements for
litigating constitutional claims.

There is nothing in the

habeas corpus statute that requires a particular format of
procedures,

whatever procedures the State erects.

As a

matter of fact in McMann, it was the hardest case possible

23
because under Jackson. v. Dsnno, the procedures that were allowed
were held to be unconstitutional, and yet in McHann it was
still required that they pursue whatever procedures were
available at the time for vindicating that confession claim.
QUESTIOHs

I suppose that if Congress now passed a

statute and said Federal habeas will not be available in
circumstances which it describes that would fit the New York
statute.

There is no question that Federal habeas wouldn’t

be available.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

No, of course not.

So what you really are saying is that

in this particular case this person didn't think he was
waiving his Federal habeas right.
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Not only that, but there is

nothing in the habeas corpus statute that suggests that a
trial as opposed to a plea is the only way of preserving the
issue for subsequent habeas corpus review.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose habeas corpus still turns

on whether there has been denial of some Federal right.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:
f

Yes, but what I am saying is —

Thera may not have been some denial of

.1 -i

State rights, but there —
MR. NEUSTADTER:

No, no.

That's perfectly true,

that would be the sine qua non of any habeas petition, is an
allegation

the constitutional violation had resulted in

■.

24
conviction.
The only point I am making with respect to the habeas
corpus statute this time is that the other basic of habeas
corpus is that you present the issue to State court for possible
remedy there.

That’s a matter of comity*

QUESTION:

I suppose you are saying, Mr. Neusfcadter,

that pre-813, the only way under State procedure you could
preserve this constitutional fourth amendment language is by
going to trial.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And then you go all the way as far as you

could go -MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

Then you come into Federal habeas.

MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

So you appeal.

That is correct.

Now, New York has said, no, there is

another way you can preserve it.

You can plead guilty and

take it by appellate route.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

That’s precisely the point.

But is that entirely true as to the pre-

813-c practice in New York?

You certainly had a motion to

suppress in the trial court before 813-c was enacted.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
a pretrial.

Oh, yes.

Well, it wasn’t done at

In other words, it was done within the trial

itself with the jury sitting there.

That was precisely the

25
defect that was noted in Jackson v. Dsn.no.
in the corpus of the trial itself.

You had to do it

And you would litigate

the voluntariness of the confession right within the body of
the trial, which is why, if you pleaded and did not go to
trial, you obviously are abandoning your claira of coerced
confession because that was the only way to litigate it without
a trial.
QUESTION:

Was that true as to fourth amendment

claims, too, there was no —
MR. NEUSTADTER:

There was never really that bind

with fourth amendment claims for the simple reason that almost
immediately after Mapp came down, the State enacted S13~c.
So you never had a time lag.
QUESTION:

However, there was

Was 313~c in existence at the time that

McMann was decided?
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Yes, but it did not extend to

confessions, it only extended to physical evidence sought to
be suppressed on fourth amendment grounds.
QUESTION:

Of course, McMann didn’t say the result

would be different under the Hew York procedure.
MR. NEUSTADTER:

No, of course not.

I mean, I

presume that’s why we are all here today, to resolve that
footnote in McMann

saying we do not pass upon that issue.

I rely on it, and I suppose it’s somewhat peculiar to have
both petitioner and respondent here invoking as support the

26

identical cases.

We are both relying on McMann and Toilets

although for rather different propositions.

I read McMann

and Toilet as basing habeas corpus availability upon the
preceding context of State procedures and whether or not the
clairs, which must be presented in the first instance to State
court as a matter of comity, whether that claim has been
presented in accord with State statutory procedures.
the only way to do it was a trial.
eliminated the trial.

In McMann

The plea obviously

The defendants in McMann did not

present their claim in accord with State statutory procedures
in McMann, and they could not thereafter seek to overturn the
tables on the state by way of habeas corpus.

They did not

give the State the opportunity to correct their own errors,
and habeas corpus will not lie.
I think that a few other things really bear mention
here.
QUESTION;

Mr. Neustadter.

MR. NEUSTADTERs
QUESTIONS

Yes.

I should have asked Mr. Hammer.

the Attorney General get

..

Where?

How did

At what

stage?
MR. NEUSTADTER:

He got in at the Appellate Term

level in this case, Appellate Term being on of the intermediate
appellate courts which determines misdemeanor \appeals.
Under, I forget the precise statutory section.

I

27
think it5 s 71 of the Executive Law, any time the constitutionality
of a State statute is involved in a case, the Attorney General
must be served with the papers and at his election may
intervene.

Of course, at no point in the State proceedings

although he was intervening, were we given the slightest

wisp

of a signal that we would have the trap door slammed shut on
us if ws marched then to Federal court, not the slightest hint,
which, by the way, is another theme that I would like to
pursue on this case, because there is really a basic unfairness
here, parallel to the unfairness that I think annoyed this
Court in cases like Toilet and McMann.
Toilet and McMann

Here you have,in

you had a defendant in both cases who

pleaded guilty who thereby bypassed State remedies for
raising various constitutional claims.

In Toilet, of course,

it was a grand jury selection, and in McMann it was the
voluntariness of the confession.

And they were perfectly

delighted with their pleas at the time and presumably these were
knowing and counseled pleas, voluntary in all respects, with
counsel at their side, advising them presumably as to the
fact that if they plead they cannot litigate anything further
because of State procedures in Tennessee and in New York at
the time.

And then, 20 years after the event they come

marching into Federal court, after the State has a justifiable
expectation that the book has been closed on the case, the
defendants having failed to litigate the claim at all in State

28

court.
QUESTIONS

Do you think it was clear in those cases

that they ever wore advised they would be giving up habeas
as well as State remedies?
HR. NEUSTADTERs

Neither opinion addresses itself

to that.
QUESTION:

You shouldn't suggest that they did, then,

because maybe the odds are quite the opposite.
MR. NEUSTADTERs

No.

Of course, it was also, as I

recall one of the closing portions of Mr. Justice Rehnquist's
opinion in Toilet was that if the defendant was — oh, as a
matter of fact, in your opinion as well in McMarm, if the
defendant was somehow misadvised as to the form which he
should first present the claim, he might have another habeasable
petition, to wit, competence of counsel.
QUESTION %

Yes, counsel.

MR. NEUSTADTERs

But it strikes me as rather unfair

in this case for the State to sit by and allow the defendant
to litigate under the aegis of tills statute and the variable
, ,,

as it is, not only - for the benefix of the defendant

but for the benefit of the State.

They avoid, it’s an

additional inducement to avoid unnecessary trials, and I
certainly don't have to explain to you what the trial backlog
situation is in New York.

To allow under the aegis of this

statute a guilty plea under the promise essentially that the

plea does not terminate litigation of the fourth amendment
claim without specifying when it does or when it doesn’t.
simply leaves it open.

It

Go ahead and plead, we don't care,

we’re not going to stop you from litigating the fourth amendment
claim's which you have litigated in accordance with our statute
before the plea.

Go ahead and plead, and we don't consider

litigation of this claim terminated by your plea.

That is the

suggestion of 813-c.
And then when things get tough ■—
QUESTION:

...

if you want to go on waiver, the

defendant in this case, what expectation does he ever have
getting into Federal habeas corpus?
MR. NEUSTADTERs

Well, the record doesn’t demonstrate

a particular defined or articulated expectation.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume you had one.

Give me some

Federal basis for his expectation.
MR. NEUSTADTERs

Well, of course, the Second

Circuit, the extant Second Circuit law at the time.
QUESTION:

Well, by the time he pleaded McMann had

been decided.
MR. NEUSTADTERs
McMann had been decided.
QUESTION:

No.

No.

At the time he pleaded

I think it had just been decided.

Well, if he read the case, the question,

was open, he had no legitimate expectations about this issue.
And there has never been anything else indicated here.

No. Well, I think ~

Well, isn't that so?

Yon just agreed that

McMarm said the question was open.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is true.

What legitimate expectation did he have

about Federal habeas?
MR. NEUSTADTER:

That the State would not say it’s

foreclosed to him.
QUESTION:

All right, that the State wouldn't, but

how about the ultimate Federal law.
QUESTIONS

All the State promised him in 813~c was

did he have the right to take the thing to whether it's the
Appellate Term or the Court of Appeals, they certainly didn't
promise him that they would not oppose a Federal habeas —
MR. NEUSTADTER:

No, but isn’t that statute rather

pregnant with the suggestion that we have no expectation that
your plea has terminated the litigation -QUESTION:

That's a State law question.

QUESTION:

That’s a Federal law question, and if

you read McMarm, you would know that the question is open.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
then.

Well, I would like to get into that

The question of whether Federal law controls a waiver

and so forth, really, there are two things, two aspects of
that problem.
QUESTION:

You aren't suggesting that it doesn't

31
do it?
MR. NEUSTADTER;

No, not for a minute.

that the —■ let's put it this way:

I'm suggesting

Assume there has been some

default, because that's generally what we are talking about,
we are talking about a waiver, there has been some lapse, some
failure to pursue a remedy, some kind of default in State
court, some failure to raise or preserve the constitutional
claim in accord with State procedure.

Now, it’s a matter of

Federal law as to whether that defect, or that default, I
should say, is going to be binding on the defendant, to wit,
is it voluntary, knowing, and so forth.
What the default waives is a matter of State
procedural preferences.
QUESTION:

That's the distinction to be drawn.

Well, within the State system.

But

it certainly doesn't determine what Federal ...
MR. NEUSTADTER:

This is true, but the entire

Federal habeas corpus statute is tied into State procedure.
QUESTION:

I take it you would concede that if the

MeMann footnote had said, "And furthermore, even in New York,
the plea of guilty waives any resort here," you wouldn't be
here.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.

Well, McMann didn't say that; it said

it's open.
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Yes.

Yes.

How many other States have this 313-c —

MR. NEUSTADTER:
an identical statute.

Well, right now, Wisconsin has

There is a proposed code of Indiana

Both of those States, by the

way specifically refine the New York procedure.

The New

MR. NEUSTADTER:

California has something like this.

That’s a slightly different arrangement there
QUESTION:

And what have the Federal habeas corpus

courts held with respect to those State statutes, do you know?
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Well, there' is a case right now,

I believe, pending in the Seventh Circuit with respect to a
Wisconsin defendant.

MR. NEUSTADTER;

I haven’t heard the other view

Presumably Mr. Hammer has something to say in

rebuttal.
QUESTION;

Mr. Meustadter, You haven't commented,

maybe — I just was interested that the State’s Attorney
General says that this plea of guilty in the face of that
statute forecloses your ever getting to Federal habeas corpus
but doesn’t foreclose your coming hers.
MR. NEUSTADTER;
QUESTION:

On certiorari.

On certiorari.

MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION;

I know.

That seems to me ■—

You can get into a Federal forum — I

don’t understand that.
MR. NEUSTADTER;
QUESTION;

Neither do I.

If it keeps you out of a Federal court —

35
MR. NEUSTADTERs
position.

I can't explain that anomalous

It seems to me that if you concede, as the petitione

has, that that certiorari review remains open notwithstanding
the plea.

And by the way, the New York procedure on a cert

case here, on a motion to suppress in Sibron commended itself
to a footnote in Sibron.

I mean, the Court was perfectly

aware that they were taking a case on cert notwithstanding
the plea.

And I can't explain the anomaly as to why one

aspect of Federal jurisdiction, to wit, this Court under
direct review should have the power to vindicate the
constitutional claim, but for some magical reason, another
Federal court, to wit, the district court is some hot?
divested of that power.

This I simply can't understand and I

have heard nothing from petitioner to explain it.
QUESTIONS

On the contrary, he doesn't try fc©?

He

just says 1257 allo%*s us to review constitutional decisions
of higher State courts.
MR. NEUSTADTERs

And 2254 says the same thing with

respect to habeas corpus.
But I don't think we can ignore the fact that the
touchstone of habeas corpus in 2254-d are State procedures.
After all, what are we talking about.'when we are talking about
exhaustion?

We are talking about presenting an issue to

State court under whatever State procedures are available to
present that claim.

That is what is required of a defendant

36
before be can come in and invoke Federal habeas protection.
Now, what has happened in this case?

The State has

set forth a series of procedures which the defendant has
followed chapter and verse.

He presented his claim precisely

the way the State court has allowed him to do.

The claim

is certainly of constitutional dimensions, there is no custody
problem, he ha3 exhausted his State remedies, he has not
bypassed any of them.

He has ostensibly met every requirement

of the habeas corpus statute, and for some magical reason, we
are told that the plea simply erases the print on the habeas
statute books.
QUESTIONS
again.

Going bad to this alluring prospect

If you prevail, the prospect certainly will not any

longer be so alluring because it will mean that the State
must, having made this bargain, as you put it, then the
defendant having had his cake now, can go into the Federal
district court and then the Court of Appeals and than come
up here.

Thatss not much of an inducement for any State to

avoid a lot of litigation, is it?
MR. MEUSTADTER;

I think Hew York State has found

to the contrary, because in 1970 813-c, whan the whole
Criminal Code of New York was redrafted, re-enacted 813-c
in the face of those three Second Circuit decisions, which
had already allowed habeas relief.

In other words, when the

legislature re-enacted 813-c, the new Code of Criminal

Procedure, they did it right in the teeth of those three
Second Circuit opinions, and I can't believe that they would
have done that had they thought that those decisions somehow
affected their plea bargaining process.
QUESTION:

You have 813-c and then you have an

analog to test the voluntariness of the confession.
MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Anything else?

MR. NEUSTADTER:

I.D., identification cases, the

Wade-Gilbert problems.
QUESTION:

Also, you can plead guilty

MR. NEUSTADTER:
and so on.

».

That is correct.
QUESTION:

...

pretrial plea, appeal,
Wire tap problems also.

And were all of those re-enacted in 1370

in light of the Second Circuit law?
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Yes.

As a matter of fact, I think

before 1970, before this new statute,you could not plead
you could not litigate a Wade-Gilbert issue plead in that
field.

That, you had to go to trial for.
QUESTION:

That was added in 1970?

MR. NEUSTADTER:
QUESTION:
May 4, 1970.

That was added.

That’s a new one.

McMann itself wasn’t decided until

So whatever the New York legislature may have

had in mind in 1970 in view of Second Circuit cases, it
wouldn't be Second Circuit cases that had been considered in

38

the light of McMann r would it?
MR. MEUSTADTER?

Four years have passed since McMann

and not a creature is stirring in the legislature with respect
to changing the statute.
QUESTION?

Well, you said a moment ago that the

Mew York legislature in the teeth of these three Second Circuit
cases, nonetheless chose to reaffirm or re-enact it.

But if

they didn’t know about McMann at the time, that isn’t quite
the same thing.
MR. NEUSTADTER:

But in the four years that have

elapsed since McMann they could have modified their view
accordingly.
QUESTION?

Well, true, but the consideration they

gave it in 1970, it sound to me to be a little bit different
factually than you intimated a moment ago.
MR. NEUSTADTER:

Well, I can't point to legislative

documents to sav what they considered and what they don't.
I could be drawing an inference from the existence of very
clear pronouncements by the Second Circuit with respect to
New York statutes, and l'm drawing the further inference that
State legislatures, that are made up 60 percent of lawyers,
at least a few of them were aware of these decisions.
QUESTION?

And they have re-enacted them.

Maybe not because of the Second Circuit law, but in spite of
tiie Second Circuit law.

That's the point.

39

MR. NEUSTADTERs
QUESTION2

Yes, that's precisely the point.

So McMann wouldn't have made much

difference.
MR. NEUSTADTERz

I really have said just about

everything I want to say, with really two small exceptions,
which I am going to close with.

I would like to repeat two

things, and really that's all I hope you will remember when
you go into conference this case.

That is that the

consequences of a plea of guilty or waiver or call it what
you may within the context of habeas corpus problems, simply
cannot be determined in an abstract vacuum.

You have to take

a look at the entire State procedural context, and that’s
because the entire habeas corpus statute is geared in toward
State procedures.

What did the State give him, what would

the State in terms of remedies allow him to use?

Did he

avail himself of the remedies the State gave him?

Everything

is keyed into what the State remedial context is, and does
not proscribe that only State trials preserve an issue for
habeas corpus review, whatever State procedures are available.
And, finally, if there is a waiver in this case,
it is the petitioner's waiver, it is the State's waiver.
By enacting section 813-c, essentially, which I presume was
a voluntary counseled, knowing, and intelligent act, the
State has abandoned its expectation that the plea of guilty
terminated litigation of this constitutional claim.

40
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Neustadter.

You have about six minutes left, Mr. Hammer.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. HAMMER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.
I was interested in the fact that counsel

for respondent spent a good deal of his time arguing the
benefits to the State of New York of this statute in that it
encourages guilty pleaers.

You are here representing the

Attorney General of New York.
MR. HAMMER:

What do you have to say to that?

I would submit, your Honor, that while

the statute does confer reciprocal benefits upon both the
people and the defendant, however, the considerations underlying
the enactment of such a statute are in our view completely
immaterial to the legal question at bar, and that is what is
the jurisdiction of the Federal district court?

And it's

our contention that the State legislature, regardless of
the considerations, has absolutely nothing to do with establish­
ing or amending or creating jurisdiction in the district court.
It can't.

Only Congress and with this Court interpreting the

statutes of Congress can affect the district court’s jurisdiction.
I would like to re-emphasise that waiver is not an
issue in this case.

The plea of guilty forms the independent

basis for the conviction.

In fact, McMann itself is not a

41
waiver case since it dealt with the substantive law on when
a guilty plea.may be impeached.

The decision of this Court in

Boyle .in has nothing to say about that a guilty plea will be
overturned if the defendant isn't advised that he has or has
not the right to go into the district court for Federal habeas
corpus ultimately.
In the case, of Mann v. Smith/ although the procedure
in California is slightly different than that in New York,
the operative fact hare is the guilty plea.

The respondent's

attorney made much of the fact that the. alleged anomaly in
this Court5s certiorari jurisdiction direct from the State
courts and our contention that the district court lacks
jurisdiction.

The statutes are clear,

to do with this case.

2254(b) has nothing

The question is whether there is a

violation of a Federal right under 2241(c)(3).

Of course,

since this Court on certiorari considers only cases of
national significance, the overall intrusive effect onto
State criminal law process will be much less than if there
is original jurisdiction in the district courts.
Counsel spoke of springing the trap because we
never talked about the .Second Circuit's ruling in Rogers in
the State court.

The simple answer is we had no occasion to.

It was not known at the time and couldn't possibly be known
what the defendant's intentions were in the event his State
appeals went against him.

42
As for the expectation of the State, the expectation
was very simple, to give the defendant a State appeal.
all the State intended»

That's

That's all the defendant could

possibly expect, reasonably expect in the light of the State
statute.

Of course, the re-enactment of the statutes in the

alleged light of the Second Circuit rulings we would regard
as being not material.

It's our view, your Honors, that the

logic of the McMann case, of Toilet, of Blackledge requires
a reversal in this action, and we respectfully so submit.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;44 p.m., the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
