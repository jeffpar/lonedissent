REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF:

E.5:2£EEDIKGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first tiiis morning in No. 73-1308* Laing against the United
States, and 74-75, United States against Hall, the two cases
being consolidated.
Mr. Smith, before you proceed, let me announce that
Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall is unavoidably delayed in
getting here due to the weather conditions of the roads and
he will participate in the case on the basis of the tapes up
to the time that he actually arrives.
You may proceed, Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH ON
BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES ET AL
MR. SMITH:
Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

These two cases which have been consolidated come here

on writs of certiorari from the United States Courts of
Appeals for the Sixth and Second Circuits.

They present a

procedural issue under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

That

is, whether the Corranission of Internal Revenue is required to
issue a notice of deficiency in connection with his termination
of a taxpayer's taxable year pursuant to that authority
granted him by section 6851 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Courts of Appeals have divided on this question
with the Second Circuit in the Laing case holding that the

Commissioner is not so required to issue a notice and the
Sixtn circuit Holding that the Commissioner is required to
issue such a notice.

In our view the Sixth Circuit in imposing

such a requirement on the Commissioner has erroneously
merged two different statutory provisions of the Code, the
termination provision, section 6851, and an early assessment
provision which is presently set out in section 5861 of the
Code.
The significance of the way these cases arrive
and the significance of the issue for purposes of these cases
is that if the Commissioner is riot so required to issue a
notice of deficiency in connection with a termination case,
as we submit, the parties are agreed that these suit3 are
barred ny the Anti-Injunction Act, a longstanding statute
which Congress enacted over a hundred years ago which
prohibits suits to enjoin the collection and assessment of
taxes by any person in any court.
At the outset I think it important --QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

I thought it was with explicit exception.
With an explicit exception.

The scope

of that exception is at issue here.
At the outset I think the Court should bear in mind
an important historical fact about how our present system of
tax litigation has developed.

The Tax Court, which was

established by Congress as the Board of Tax Appeals only in

1924, and the United States Government has been collecting
taxes for more than a hundred years.
Now for perhaps the last 125 years the Treasury
has been empowered to assess and collect certain taxes like
excise taxes prior to the time they are due to be paid, just
the way the termination provision works here with respect to
income taxes.
Wow, coupled with the Anti-Injunction Act, a taxpayer
subject to a termination of excise taxes cannot bring a suit
to enjoin the collection of those taxes and, because of
Congress' decision that excise taxes are not adjudicable in
the Board of Tax Appeals, but only in the District Court, the
taxpayers are limited to a refund suit of the amount corrected.
Wow, we think that the issue here represents very
much the same sort of thing.

A congressional decision very

much like the congressional decision, to limit the jurisdiction
of the Tax Court to income, estate, and gift taxes, that there
has been a congressional decision here which the statutory
history demonstrates not to permit the Tax Court to review
assessments made by the Commissioner in connection with a
terminated taxable period.

In fact, that is still the law

today with respect to excise taxes, as section 6862 of the
Code so provides.
Wow, the facts in the casesare somewhat parallel
and they are undisputed and can be stated briefly as follows:

6

In the Laing case, 73-1808, the taxpayer Laing is a
citizen of New Zealand.

In May of 1972 ha entered the United

States from Canada on a temporary visitor’s visa.

In late June

he was traveling with two companions in a rented automobile
from northern United States, in Vermont, and attempting to get
into Canada.

Because the Canadian officials were dissatisfied

with the identification proffered by one of the passengers,
they were refused entry into Canada.
They then turned around and returned to the United
States and were stopped by United States Customs officials
at Derby, Vermont.

Upon a search of the vehicle in which

they were traveling, the Customs officials found concealed in
the engine compartment of their car a suitcase containing
more than $300,000 in United States currency.
Now, once this discovery was made by the Customs
officials, they in turn notified the District Director of
Internal Revenue in Burlington, Vermont, and upon once having
received the information, the District Director terminated the
taxable years of all three people in the car pursuant to his
authority under section 6851 of the Code, one of the statutes
here which was employed in both cases.
Assessments were then made against each individual
in an amount of approximately $195,000 for this terminated
period, that is, from January 1, 1972, until June 24, 1972,
the day that the discovery of the cash was ascertained by the

7
Customs officials.
QUESTION:

Does the record show how that figure

was arrived at?
MR. SMITH;

The record does not show how that figure

was arrived at, but perhaps I can help the Court with that.
Apparently what was done was the taxpayer, that is, Laing
and his two companions, were subjected to a net worth plus
nondeductible expenditures computation.

That is, they were

asked -— Laing was asked as to how long he was in the Unload
States.

It turned out to be some 20 or 30 days.

The

District Director then made a computation based on his living
expenses for that period; in turn the value of other cash on
their persons was also included as part of their net worth,
and an income figiire was arrived at of some $315,000 or so.
There was also a quantity of hashish found on the person of
Laing which was valued at a certain retail value; and once
a gross income figure was arrived at, then the Internal
Revenue Service gave each taxpayer, each person in the car
credit for the standard deduction and a personal exemption and
then the resulting taxable income figure was arrived at on
which the tax was computed.

It turned out to be something like

$195,000.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith,would you assume that I asked

the same question when you cover the Hall case?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, I shall, and I will be glad to

8

elaborate on that also, although the record is similarly silent.
Now, the assessments were then made in the amount of
$195,000.

Now, Laing and his two companions refused to pay

this tax.

Once having an assessment, the Commissioner exercised

his correction powers which are also well settled in the
Internal Revenue Code.

Section 6331 provides for levy and

restraint power to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and
as a result, since the tangible property, that is, the cash,
was available, the Internal Revenue Service levied upon this
cash that was found hidden in the engine compartment in the
suitcase.
Now, three or four months later, then, Laing
commenced this action in tie United States District Court for
tiie District of Vermont, seeking to enjoin the Commissioner's
assessment and coll ac tion of these taxes and prohibiting his
continued possession of this money.

The Government defended

this suit on the ground of the Anti-Injunction Act which
prohibits these kind of injunctive suits for assessment or
collection of taxes.
QUESTION:

The relief he sought

in the District

Court, then, was not simply to require you to issue a
deficiency notice but actually return the
MR. SMITH:

No.

Yes.

The relief he sought was to

enjoin the Service's continued possession of this money and
to return it to him.

There was no attempt to

although some

8a
of these cases involve that kind of relief,, these cases involve
simply a question of relief sought by the taxpayers is to
prohibit the continued possession by the Internal Revenue
Service of the money levied upon.

QUESTION!

Because tilers hadn't been a notice of

deficiency.
MR, SMITH:

Yes.

And the ground that the taxpayers

urge is that because the Commissioner has not issued a notice
of deficiency in this case, then the Anti-Injunction Act does
not apply.
Now, the District Court in Laing dismissed the
taxpayer's action and on an appeal to the Second Circuit that
court affirms on the authority of its previous decision in the
Irving case.
QUESTION:
a little bit.

Mr. Smith, would you straighten me out

Had this been a jeopardy assessment after the

conclusion of a taxable year, a deficiency notice would be
issued even after assessment, wouldn't it?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Does this mean that with a jeopardy

assessment, that one may than go to the Tax Court even though
the assets have been levied upon?
MR. SMITH:

That's correct.

That's what section —

once you have a jeopardy assessment with respect to a full
taxable year, which we submit involves an entirely different

9

statutory provision. Section 6861(b) provides that the
Commissioner shall issue a notice of deficiency within 60 days
of the making of the assessment, if he hasn’t already done so.
QUESTION:

That being the case, how would the

Government be hurt by a ruling that in the event of a termination
as distinguished from a jeopardy assessment a notice of
deficiency could be issued after the fact enabling the taxpayer
to go to the Tax Court?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think the best way to answer

that question is to simply say that the Government has taken
the position in these cases that Congress has made a decision
that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue need not issue a
deficiency notice in connection with a termination of a
taxable year simply because Congress has made the other decision
in allocating the jurisdiction of the various courts which hear
tax disputes that the Tax Court is not empowered to hear suits
involving teminations of taxable years,
I think the Commissioner has proceeded on that basis
since this termination statute was enacted in the Revenue Act
of 1918 and, as we point out in our petition in the Hall case,
there are some 70 cases now pending in the courts and an
additional hundreds of cases nov; pending administratively
which involve this issue where the Commissioner has taken the
consistent position that he need not issue a notice of
deficiency.

And I suppose that the Government would be hurt in

10

the sense that those assessments, the validity and propriety
of those assessments, would be put at issue if the Commissioner
was deemed to have to issue a notice of deficiency™

All the

Commissioner is saying here is that he has followed what he
thinks is the congressional decision that he need not issue
such notice of deficiency.

I think the point here is that review in the Tax
Court of these kinds of termination actions dees not
particularly disadvantage taxpayers, while some of the courts
which have held that the Coramissioner must issue a notice of
deficiency, I think, were prompted by what they thought were
serious questions of unfairness by not providing immediate
access to the Tax Court.
QUESTION:

Well, the. Commissioner's position then,

of course, raises the constitutional issue.
MR. SMITH:

The Commissioner’s position raised the

coxisti.tutional issue, although I think as we point out in our
brief, not only do we think that the statutory history
demonstrates the existence of that kind of congressional
decision to allocate jurisdiction in a termination case not
to the Tax Court but to the District Court, but that in fact
that decision, that congressional decision, doesn't pose any
serious constitutional problems because of the existence of
an adequate remedy in the district court.
Now, so the Second Circuit has held that the Government

11
is correct in its contention that the Commissioner need not
issue a notice of deficiency in connection with these
termination cases.
How, the facts in the Hall case are relatively
parallel.

What happened to the taxpayer in the Hall case was

that she was arrested by the Kentucky State police and charged
with a narcotics — charged with being involved in the sale
of illegal narcotics.
QUESTION:

Before you leave that, trace out the

steps of the remedy in the district court.

What must the

taxpayer do before he can assert a remedy in the district
court?
MR. SMITH:

What the taxpayer must do before he

can assert a remedy in the district court is to file claim
for refund.

That’s what the Code provides, because presumably

the Commissioner should have an opportunity administratively
to be able to determine the validity of the claim.
QUESTION:

Before he files the claim for refund,

there must be something on which the refund, can operate.
MR. SMITH:

Sure.

In tills particular case the

refund claim can operate on the amount levied upon, in both
these cases.
Now, once the Commissioner — the Code provides, that
the Commissioner has 6 months to process such a claim.

If he

doesn’t process such a claim in 6 months, you can bring a suit

12
in the district court.

And as we pointed out in our brief,

the 6-month period is foreshortened by informal means,

For

example, Laing, after the close of the taxable year, brought
a refund suit which he filed on March 1, 1973.

It was denied

on March 9, 1973, and indeed ~
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Not a suit,
Yes; he filed a claim.

But the refund

claimw as denied by the District Director on March 9, 1973,
only 3 days later.
QUESTION:

But that certainly is a most unusual,

quick action.
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Justice Blackman, I don't think it's

that unusual because I think in connection —- I myself have
had experience with filing refund claims on behalf of taxpayers
where when it becomes clear in the normal case where you have
gone through the audit process and the Service is taking one
position and you are taking another — in fact, in this case,
it was obvious even at this juncture that this was going to be
an issue that was ultimately going to have to be resolved by
this Court since’ the Courts"of Appeals had split on the
question, it seemed obvious that the Commissioner was going
to deny the claim.

And in those circumstances, I on many

occasions asked that the claim be denied promptly.
cases the Service is perfectly happy to do that.

In most
There is no

reason to keep the claims that it is obviously going to deny

13

anyway pending for the 6-months period, and if for some reason
the 6-months period is consumed, then the taxpayer can bring
the suit on the day after the 6-months period is expired,,
QUESTION:

Though it's of no significance, my

experience has been just the opposite, the Government waits
despite the —
HR, SMITH:

In any event, I think that the 6-months

period — I don't think that the 6-months period poses any
significant constitutional problems,

I think that the Court

in tiie Phillips case,Justice Brandeis simply said that when
you have these summary correction remedies, the important
thing is that the taxpayer have an opportunity for post
correction review.

And if that post correction review here

takes place after 6 months, that is an administrative
decision made by Congress that the Service should have an
adequate opportunity to be able to appraise the validity of
a claim.

All claims are not easy to handle, and the Service

should have a minimum amount of time to handle these claims.
QUESTION:

The Hall position is a little bit

different from Mr. Laing's in that regard, because as I under­
stand it, the amount assessed against her was considerably
more than the value of what was seized.
MR. SMITH:

That is true, although again we don't

think that that makes any difference in terms of her remedy.
She could have still filed a claim for refund, in our view,

14
and gone to the district court.

And, indeed, that is what

makes this case somewhat curious because here you have taxpayers
who in their brief are strenuously arguing that they have been
denied some very important right, and that is to be able to
get a notice of deficiency and go to the Tax Court.

But the

Tax Court is not necessarily a particularly favorable forum
for the adjudication of these types of cases if what the
taxpayers are concerned with is speed.

Because it has been

recently estimated that it takes about two years from filing
of petition to final decision to litigate a case in the Tax
Court.

The Tax Court is a busy forura.
QUESTION:

But a good argument can be made, certainly,

it's the only forum for someone who can't pay all the amount
of the assessment under the Flora case.
MR. SMITH:

There is an argument that the Flora case

would bar litigation in the district court, at least types
of cases with respect to someone in Mrs. Hall's position.

We

think that argument misreads this Court's Flora opinion.
What this Court held in Flora was that under
general circumstances a taxpayer cannot bring a refund suit
until he has paid the full amount of the assessment.

In reaching

that decision, the Court painstakingly went through the
legislative history in connection with the creation of the
Board of Tax Appeals, and there \?ere indications going both
ways as to what Congress really intended.

But I think that the

15
really operative portion of the Chief Justice" opinion in Flora
was the fact that there the taxpayer had another remedy.

He

could have gone to the Tax Court, and that made all the
difference in Flora because essentially you had a situation
where if you were subjected to an assessment of $100 and you
want to pay $2 and go to the district court, well, then this
Court said in Flora you can11 do that, you have to pay the
whole $100.

And the reason the Court said that in Flora was

because, as the Chief Justice said, he could have gone to the
Tax Court without paying a single cent.

And the fact of

the existence of that Tax Court review convinced the Court
that if they had held to the contrary in Flora, they would
have infringed upon the prepayment jurisdiction of the Tax
Court because essentially you have a situation where you could
split the cause of action, you could in effect litigate the
refund suit for $2 and perhaps litigate the $93 case in the
Tax Court.

This Court held that Congress didn't want to

split those causes of action and cause these two different
systems, that is refund review and Tax Court review, to
infringe upon each other.
Here that rationale has no application because we
say that Congress has made a conscious decision not to give
the Tax Court jurisdiction over these termination cases.
Once that is accepted, as we thinJc the statutory history
demonstrates, then Flora is no bar to the bringing of these

16

kinds of suits, whether the whole amount is seised or not,
in the district court.
That brings us to the point that I wanted to make
about the Tax Court not being a particularly — these taxpayers
are complaining in effect that they have been frozen out of the
•fax Court, blocked to immediate access to the Tax Court.

But

given the two-year time that it takes to litigate a tax case
in the Tax Court, it seems to us that it would be far more
favorable to these taxpayers subject to termination to bring
a refund suit for the amount seised and bring that suit in the
district court.
In most district courts the time for bringing a
refund suit is considerably shorter than 2 years.

I think

that's quite plain with respect to the district courts in
Kentucky and certainly it's clear with respect to the district
courts in Vermont.

In fact, that refund suit in Vermont with

respect to the Laing case is now being held up awaiting the
decision of this Court.

In effect, if this action had never

been brought, Laing would have had long ago a disposition with
respect to the propriety of his refund claim in the district
court in Vermont.
QUESTION;

Of course your argument assumes that speed

is the only criterion.
MR. SMITH;

I think that in this particular case

speed is an important criterion to the taxpayers, in the sense

17
that their assets have been levied upon.

If you read the

complaints of the taxpayers in the record appendices, Laing
complains that money was taken away from him, business
opportunities were lost.

It seems to me that a prompt

adjudication of his claim is really the most important thing
that he wants.

And having brought this action to enjoin on

the basis of so-called exception to the Anti-Injunction Act
is in effect delaying what we think is his most meaningful
and effective remedy and that is a refund suit in the district
court.
QUESTION: Mr. Smith, as I understand your position,
you are saying that when the Government proceeds under 6851
the taxpayer should not. have the normal option of going either
to the district court after he has paid the tax or going
immediately to the Tax Court itself.
policy or

But what reason in'

otherwise is there for denying that option to

taxpayers who have been proceeded against under 6851?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Well, it's a congressional decision.
Granted that, but —
Well, I suppose the only way to analogize

it is to compare it to the congressional decision to exclude
excise tax jurisdiction from the Tax Court.

It's hard to

imagine if we were planning a new kind of procedure we perhaps
would say the Tax Court ought to have jurisdiction over excise
tax cases.

But Congress has quite plainly said that that

18

court is to only have jurisdiction over income, estate, and
gift taxes-

Congress could have decided the other way

given the Tax Court jurisdiction over those cases,

and

But once

having decided the other way, the Commissioner has more or
less felt himself hound by that congressional decision and has
refrained consistently from issuing notices of deficiency
with respect to these cases.
QUESTION:

I return to the question Mr- Justice

Blackmun asked, in what way would the Government be prejudiced
if the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit blending these
two statutes together were construed by the Commissioner to
be the correct interpretation?
MR. SMITH:

It's hard to imagine how the Government

would be prejudiced other than the fact that, because of the
Commissioner's consistent policy, perhaps some $100 million
of assessments that we have pointed out in our petition in the
Hall case would be endangered. I think that is a significant
to
prejudice/the Commissioner operating under a fair ruling of
the statutes that he was not so required to issue a notice of
deficiency.
I suppose the answer also was in what we are talking
about here when we are talking about people who are subject to
these terminations.

These are not normal taxpayers.

These

are people who are committing some act that the Commissioner
believes will tend to defeat the collection of their future tax

19

liability»

I think if you look at the. words of section 6851,

it says, "If the Secretary or his delegate finds that a taxpayer
designs quickly to depart from the United States or to remove
his property therefrom, or to conceal himself or his property
therein,
or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to
tow
render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the
income tax."
QUESTION:

That’s that clear in the Laing case, for

example, where money was about to be transported out of the
United States.

Is it equally clear to you in the Hall case?

MR. SMITH:

I think it is in the sense that in the

Hall case you have a taxpayer with respect to whom the
Commissioner has received information that she is involved in
illegal clandestine activities of an income-producing nature.
And I think that it's a fair assumption that people who are
involved in clandestine income-producing activities which are
illegal often do not report the income, do not declare the
income on their income tax return.

In fact, in this particular

case Mrs. Hall filed a full year income tax return reporting
a gross income from wages of $530 for the whole year.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Commissioner had read that

someone had burglarised, say, a liquor store or grocery store
and made off with $10,000, or a bank.
• • * i•

}

'

Would that justify an

'

assessment?
MR. SMITH:

I think it would.

You see, Mr. Justice

20

Powell# you are concentrating with respect to the Laing

case

with respect to the statutory language about intending quickly
to depart, and that indeed is an important part of this
statute.

In fact, departing aliens who leave this country

every day who are subject to U.S. income tax have their
taxable years terminated.

That is the normal kind of thing.

They have to secure a certificate of compliance, and itss
colloquially called a sailing permit.

They must — and the

Commissioner terminates their taxable year.
But the statute by its terms i3 not limited to
alien taxpayers.
well.

It is also subject to domestic taxpayers as

For example, in the Irving case, that was a celebrated

case in which Irving perpetrated a very notable hoax in which
he received soma $755,000 from a publishing company in
connection with a false biography.

Once that hoax was

discovered, the Internal Revenue Service, like your case with
the burglar, could easily come to the conclusion that Irving
was not going to pay taxes on that amount of money.

So in the

Irving case Irving's taxable year was terminated and an amount
was assessed based on receipt of that money and an amount was
levied upon, and the Second Circuit rejected Irving's claim
which is the same claim that the taxpayers make in these cases
that the Commissioner must issue a notice of deficiency with
respect to these cases.
I think that illegal activity raises a connotation

21

that if people are breaking other laws in a clandestine way,
I think it’s a fair assumption by the Internal Revenue Service
that they are not going to meet their tax liability»

Our tax

system is based on a voluntary disclosure, and if people are
involved in illegal activity, it’s a fair assumption that they
are not going to meet that voluntary obligation»

Under those

circumstances, Congress has given the Commissioner power to
make this artificial termination of the taxable year, because
instead of having to wait until the following April 15,
Congress has said to the Commissioner, "You may terminate
someone's taxable year and collect taxes on that terminated
period„"
QUESTION:
it.

Nobody is questioning that, as I understand

Aren't the revenues adequately protected by the Commissioner's

power to summarily levy and keep in his possession —
MR, SMITH:

The protection of the revenue is not at

issue here with respect to whether the Commissioner should or
should not issue a notice of deficiency.
in dispute.

I don't think that's

What concerns us is the fact that Congress has

made a legislative decision which is evidenced in therRevenue
Act of 1921 through the Revenue Act and through the creation of
a Board of Tax Appeals that the Tax Court is not to have
jurisdiction over these termination cases.
I think I can demonstrate that.

We have set it forth

in great detail in our brief, but I think it can be demonstrated

22
by the sequence of legislative events that occurred from 1910
through the Revenue Act of 1926.
QUESTION:

If what this suit was all about in the

district court in the Laing case was to get the money back,
I would suppose that if the Government can keep the money
whether a notice has to be issued or not pending litigation
somewhere, the plaintiff could never win in the district court
in such a suit.
MR. SMITH:

I am not exactly sure why you say that.

Once a refund suit is brought, and if the district court, for
example, were to say that the taxpayer is entitled to a
refund —
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand that, they can get the

money back if they win the lawsuit.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But pending litigation under this kind

of an assessment or a jeopardy assessment, the Government can
keep the money while litigation is going on.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, Congress has made that —Isn't that right?
That's right.
Well, then, how could the plaintiff ever

have won his case in the district court?
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

In these particular cases?
Yes.

He said, "I want the money back

23
because you didn’t issue a notice of deficiency.
MR. SMITH:

Well, the whole point is that he is not

entitled to win his case by raising —
QUESTION:

I know, but that would be true whether

he went to the Tax Court or whether he went to the district

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Indeed that’s so.
Then I still don’t think you have given

a glimmer as to how the Government is hurt in this case other
than making a legalistic argument ivhich is a fair argument, al
right, as to what Congress intended.
MR. SMITH:

We think that the Service has fair —

it is a legal argument in the sense that v;e are construing
statutes.
QUESTION:

Let’s suppose you lose this suit.

to keep the money.

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

That's* what I want to knew.
Well, I suppose —
Is it too late for you to issue a notice?
Well, for example, the ground upon which

the decisions holding that we have to issue a notice are
premised on merging section 6861 into 6851.

Section 6861(b)

24

requires the Commissioner to issue a notice within SO days
of the making of the assessment. I suppose the taxpayer
could urge that if we didn't issue it within 60 days the
whole assessment is invalid.
Now, the Board of Tax Appeals in a case called
?

Jo H. Reese, which is not cited in our brief, I think it’s in
15 B.T.A., has held when the Commissioner fails to issue a
notice of deficiency in connection with a straight jeopardy
assessment, not a termination case, the jeopardy assessment
is invalid.
Nov;, I think that in that sense the Government ~
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Let me make a new one.
I don’t know whether this action is still

open to make a new one in this case.
QUESTION:

But at least prospectively, the collection

of the revenue would not be the least bit impaired if you
lost tiiis case, if you knew what the rule was in advance.
MR. SMITH:

I should think that’s right, although —

I suppose that’s right, the collection of the revenue prospec­
tively, although again I would like to point out that retro­
actively there would be a good deal of revenue lost in these
cases.
QUESTION:

You are afraid that your fail to issue

notice may have foreclosed your collecting the tax at all.
MR. SMITH:

In these cases because of the operation

25

of the statutes of limitation and with respect fc when we
were supposed to issue the notice.
QUESTION:

In Laing, a guy going across the border

with three hundred grand in the engine compartment, I would
think that would justify that sort of an assessment perhaps
even two years after he found him doing it,
MR, SMITH:

That's true, but when did this occur?

This occurred in 1972,

The Commissioner normally has two

years in which to issue an assessment.

I’m not sure after

the termination, after the conlcusion of this case whether
the statute would still be open.
But in any event, I think we are on sound ground
statutorily to taking the position that we don’t have to
issue a notice of deficiency.
QUESTION:

The taxable years involved have long

since been over, haven't they?
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

I think they are.
Has anybody filed a return?
Both of them have filed returns.

I

can tell the Court —
QUESTION:

I suppose then you are in the position

if you think it's proper to make a jeopardy assessment after
the close of a taxable year.
MR. SMITH:

Well, the statute of limitations still

operate with respect to jeopardy assessments.

26

I really don’t know the answer as to whether the
y :* J'-':

years would be open in these cases.

But there is a significant

problem as to if the Service should be subjected to issuing
a notice of deficiency, I think there would be a lot of these
cases backed up in the courts, the revenue would be endangered
with respect to them.
QUESTION?

It looks as though these years are open

for these taxpayers.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

It would appear so.
Notice could be issued tomorrow.
What?
A notice could be issued tomorrow.
A notice could be issued tomorrow, Mr.

Justice Blackmun, but, of course, the pendency of this case
makes that likelihood impossible, because the Commissioner has
taken the position that his statutory construction does not
require him to issue a notice of deficiency.

In fact, the Tax

Court has held —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

That's an administrative decision.
That's an administrative decision,

although, you know, it's a consistent decision which we have
made, which the Service has made, since this statute has been
enacted in 1918.

Because, you see, the notice of deficiency

issuance of the notice of deficiency requirement is tied to
the jurisdictional questions as to whether the Tax Court has

27
jurisdiction in these cases.
We say that Congress decided not to give the Tax Court
jurisdiction in these cases and as a result, the notice of
deficiency requirement,, that is, which has been termed the
ticket to the Tax Court, you can't get into the Tax Court
without a notice of deficiency, has no application in this
case.
The reason we say that is as follows %

This termina­

tion provision existed in the Revenue Act. of 1918 —
QUESTION:

I think we all concede this, as you have

argued it, but I gather there is a little concern up here
why, if the Government is so disturbed about the possibility
of these revenues slipping away, they don’t issue a deficiency
tomorrow as a matter of preservation of the revenues.
MR. SMITHs
that.

Well, I think it's more complicated than

I'm not sure in respect to these two cases the

Commissioner

can — whether these years are open any more.

But even more important, the Tax Court has held that it
doesn't have jurisdiction in these cases.
the Ludwig Littauer case in

It

held that in

37 B.T.A. and has consistently

held that today.
Now, I’m not sure that even if the Commissioner
issued a notice of deficiency in these cases the taxpayer
would be able to get into the Tax Court, because the Tax Court
itself has construed the statute in accordance with our

28

position that it doesn't have jurisdiction in these termination
cases.
QUESTION?
MR. SMITH:

What could you lose by it?
Well, there is nothing to lose by it

other than the fact that our posture has been in these cases
and we think it’s soundly grounded on the reading of the
statutory history, that we need not issue a notice of
deficiency, and I think the reason we need not is evidenced
in the statutory history.

This termination provision came

in in the Revenue Act of 1913.
QUESTION:

Let me interrupt you for one more question.

Is it your position that you need not or that you are not even
aut-orised?
MR. SMITH:

That we are not even authorised, in the

sense that because we are only authorised to do that in a
case where the Tax Court has jurisdiction.

I suppose it would

be a meaningless act in the sense that the Tax Court lias
consistently held that it would not take jurisdiction of a case
involving a short period year so that the issuance of a notice
of deficiency in these cases would not give the taxpayers in
termination cases any added advantage.

They itfouldn't be able

to go to the Tax Court, and in our view, they should pursue
the remedy that Congress provided for them, a rapid remedy and
one that does not pose, in our view, any constitutional problems.
QUESTION:

Is it reasonable to assume that if your

29

opponents on the other side of the table felt that you could
reach this money by this other process that we wouldn't have
any more than an academic controversy here?
MR. SMITH:

That's what makes this controversy a

strange one in the sense that we have the Tax Court here, Mr.
Chief Justice, whereby you could get this paper which permits
them entrance to the Tax Court which in our view is not a
particularly favorable mode of obtaining redress in these
cases.

Access generally involves a long and lengthy proceeding.

They want to get their money back, and it seems to us that
the way to get it back is to pursue the remedy that Congress
has provided.

That is, district court refunds.

QUESTION:

Assume for a moment hypothetically that

these intimations are correct, that you could issue the
deficiency notice now and that they could go into the Tax
Court.

Then would the Government be harmed or would the

taxpayers be benefited in any way?
MR. SMITH:

I don't think the ■— let me put it to

you this way, let me emphasize one part of that question.

I

don't think the taxpayers would be particularly benefited in
these cases.
statutory

They have brought these suits based on the

exception to the Anti-Injunction Act urging that

they are entitled to go into the Tax Court.

But that is not

a particularly favorable mode of redress in these cases.
I suppose the world would not corns to an end if these

30
cases were heard in the Tax Court,

But it's simply our

position that it’s a statutory matter. Congress has allocated
the jurisdiction of the Tax Court and the district court in
this particular way, and that termination cases are not
allocated to the Tax Court.

That court is a creature of

statute, and it doesn't have the power.

I suppose the Tax

Court could easily take the position based upon its consistent
holdings which go up until last year, which were sort of based
on the Ludwig Littauer, that it doesn't have jurisdiction.
So even if the Commissioner were to issue a notice of
deficiency, the Tax Court could take the position that it
didn't have to hear these cases involving assessments for
termination.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
of the Government.
made.

Where would the money be in the meantime?
The money would still be in the hands
That's another decision that Congress has

With respect to people like these taxpayers who

presumably, the Commissioner has made a finding that they have
taken steps to defeat the collection of taxes, affirmative
steps during the taxable year, the Commissioner has made a
finding, the Congress has decided they are to be subjected to
summary collection procedures, and while the litigation
proceeds, the Commissioner is entitled to keep the money
because I think that these kinds of taxpayers that. Congress
sets out in 6851 are not people who are expected to reliably

31
pay their tax liability.
QUESTION:

Is it really realistic to suggest that

a taxpayer like Mrs. Hall has a remedy which is based on her
paying the deficiency, in this case $52,000, when

the

Government has made a levy on all of her known assets, arguably
she might get a bond and release them, but the likelihood of
a v/oman in her plight getting a bond is not terribly bright,
is it?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I don't know what the likelihood

of her getting a bond would be.

But the point is that she

has brought this suit, Mr. Justice Powell, to enjoin the
Commissioner's action.

I suppose that she has expended funds

in connection with this suit, and we would think that if
she had channeled her litigation energies toward the right
remedy, she would be well on her way to a disposition in this.
QUESTION:

She really didn't have to pay

$52,000

to get into court, though.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

$52,000 to get into court.

She doesn't have to pay

In my colloquy with Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, I think it was pointed out in our brief, we don't
think that the Flora case bars.

Now, the courts that have

held against us, that is, the Sixth Circuit in this case, the
Fifth Circuit in Clark v. Campbell, and the Schreck case
where the District Court of Maryland more or less started
with a decision on this issue, has made quite a good deal

32

about the fact that Flora would bar such a refundo
think it would.

We don't

We don't think that a fair reading of this

Court's Flora decision yields such a result.

The Second

Circuit has held Flora wouldn't bar such a suit both in the
Irving case and presumably in this case, too, because the
Second Circuit in this case said she could bring a refund suit
at any time.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't mind if the Court said so.

MR. SMITH;
not at all.

I wouldn't mind if the Court said so, no,

I don't think the Commissioner would mind either.

QUESTION:

Was that the declaratory judgment in this

context, or was that an essential holding?
MR. SMITH:

I think, without attempting to classify

it, I think that it would be both essential from the
Commissioner's point of view and the Tax Court's.
QUESTION:

I meant advisory rather than declaratory.

MR. SMITH:

If the Court held here as we urge that

the Tax Court has no jurisdiction in these cases, I think it
would concomitantly have to reach the question as to the bar
of Flora, because the Bar of Flora is a significant bar.
you can’t get to the district court with respect to if you
don11 pay the whole thing, then 2 think that the taxpayers
here have a significant problem, because in effect it bars
for quite a long time.
QUESTION:

It's more than a problem here? it's a

If

33

significant constitutional question.
MR. SMITH:

Indeed.

And I don’t think that the

Code — I think since we are right on the statutory question
and the interpretation of Flora; I think the constitutional
question vanishes.
QUESTION:

But you have to say what is right about

Flora before the constitutional question vanishes.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Don’t you mind that we would have to

say that.
MR. SMITH:

I think that's right, Mr. Justice White.

Indeed, and I think it’s an important point, Mr.
Justice Brennan, and I think the courts that have held against
us have acknowledged, I think Judge Kaufman's opinion in
Schreck, which we think is erroneous because we don't think
that it focuses on the statutory history in this case, we think
that it has overlooked the Revenue Act of 1921 which more or
less introduced the jeopardy assessment provision into the
Code as an exception to the administrative appeal provision
which later became the Tax Court, the jurisdiction of the
Tax Court.

But I think Judge Kaufman acknowledged in this

case that the statutory questions were close and that you
could read them either way.

But what prompted his concern

and which prompted the result he reached in this case, that is,
holding that the Commissioner is required to issue such a

34

notice, is what he thought was significant constitutional
questions.

I think that if you look at the statutory history

with the point of view in mind as to how the sequence developed
and how the Tax Court is not a forum which is mandated by the
Constitution.

Congress has made a decision that the Tax Court

has jurisdiction over certain cases, and the district court
and the court of claims have jurisdiction to resolve other
kinds of tax cases.

And if these cases can go to the district

court, as we submit, I think Judge Kaufman's concerns and X
think the concerns that Judge Brown articulated in the Clark v,
Campbell opinion, which this Court is holding on our petition,
vanish.

Once you recognize that the taxpayer can go into the

district court for this rapid remedy of a refund suit, I don't
think that there are any significant constitutional problems.
In my remaining time I would like to talk a little
bit about this statutory history because I think that it sheds
important light on the congressional decision not to give the
Tax Court jurisdiction over these cases.
QUESTIONS

You haven't forgotten Mr. Justice

Blackmun's -MR. SMITH;

Yes.

Perhaps I ought to just briefly

tell Mr. Justice Blackmun and the Court as to the basis for
the assessment in the Hall case.
Now, with respect to Mrs. Hall, the Commissioner
terminated her taxable year as of the end of January 1973.

35
QUESTION?

Just one month.

MR. SMITH:

Just one month.

And the assessment figures were based upon confidential
reliable informants, from presumably the local law enforcement
officers, that Mrs. Hall was involved in the sale of illegal
drug substances, and the volume of that was also communicated
to the Internal Revenue Service.

Based on that volume and

presumably daily business, the Internal Revenue Service reached
a gross income figure.

I suppose it's something like over

a hundred thousand dollars if you are going to urind up with a
$52,000 tax liability.

Then gave her credit for the personal

exemption and for the standard deduction and then we state
the $52,000 figure.

I think though the record doesn't reflect

that, that’s my information, I have been advised by the Service
that's how they reached this result.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

And then the value of her property.
The value of her property was small by

comparison to that $52,000 figure.
account.

There was I think a bank

I think also a safety deposit box with a few thousand

dollars was also levied upon.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Was it a Volkswagen automobile?
A Volkswagen automobile, yes.

The

district court ordered the return of that car, I think, on a
preliminary injunction immediately.
But that's how the facts arise in those cases,

36

QUESTION:

That was all her discoverable property,

wasn’t it?
MR. SMITE:

That was all her discoverable property,

yes, that's correct, or at least that's all the Internal
Revenue Service could discover as of the time they made this
assessment.

I’m not aware of any other property they had been

able to discover.
I would like to turn to the statutory history in
these cases because I think they shed important light on this
question.
You see, the courts that have held against us in these
cases

and imposed the filing of a notice of deficiency had

in our view impermissibly merged two different statutory
provisions, that is, the termination provision and the
early assessment provision of Section 6861.
they can be merged.

We don't think

We think that the statutory history

indicates that they are separate and distinct provisions which
stand by themselves in the Code.

Indeed, the fact that they

came in at different times, we think, suggest that they are
separate.
The termination provision is the older provision.
It came in in the Revenue Act of 1918.

Now, from 1918 to

.1921 there was no early assessment provision.

So Congress

had just given the Commission the power to make terminations
of taxable years of peopls who were engaged in tax avoidance

37
activities for that current year.
Now, in 1921 Congress decided to establish an
administrative appeal procedure.

Now that administrative

appeal procedure was new, and what it essentially said was —
because before the Commissioner would simply make an assessment
and then collect it.

If the taxpayer didn’t pay, he was

levied upon and then had to sue for a refund.

But in 1921

the Commissioner decided to set up a procedure whereby the
taxpayer's claim, that is, that he disputed the amount, could
be heard at least administratively.

So it set up this

procedure whereby the Commissioner would have to issue a
notice to the taxpayer and the taxpayer then would have 30
days in which to file a protest or some statement of his
position.

And then that administrative appeal would be invoked.
Now, Congress also determined that while this

administrative appeal was to be invoked, the Commissioner was
not permitted to make an assessment or collect the taxes at
issue.

But because of this administrative appeal procedure,

Congress recognized that there would be cases in which the
delay of the administrative appeal would produce a danger to
the revenue and that perhaps the taxpayer's assets might be
wasted or there might be competing creditors waiting in the
wings, so Congress authorized a proviso.
proviso is important.

And I think that

We set it out at pages 70 and 71 of

Appendix B to our brief.

The proviso, which is sort of at the

38
end of the first paragraph on page 71 says, "Provided, that in
cases where the Commissioner believes that the collection of
the amount due will be jeopardized by such delay he may make
the assessment without giving such notice or awaiting the
conclusion of such hearing."
Wow, tills is the statutory predecessor of section 6861.
It came into the Code only to provide a means to the Commissioner
to have means of collection while the administrative appeal
procedure was invoked.

It has nothing to do 'with the termina­

tion provision.
Now, it's important for the Court to remember that
once the Commissioner terminates somebody's taxable year, that
statute, that is, 6851, does not provide the Commissioner with
any assessment authority.

That assessment authority derives

from the general assessment authority of section 62ua

ox

the

Code which is set forth in Appendix A of our brief, on page 53.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
Rehnquist.

When did 6201 first come into being?
That is a very old statute, Mr. Justice

I'm not exactly sure when it came in, but it came

in probably at the beginning of the time when the Treasury
was empowered

— when taxes began.

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Before 1918.
Oh,much before 1918.

it derived at least from section

In fact, I know that

3226 of the Revised

statutes which I think, you know, that's about 1866, I think.

i

But I think it probably even, you know, has roots,, historical
roots before that.
So essentially you have these two provisions in the
Code standing separately.

You have the termination provision,

and you have the early assessment provision which is an
exception to the administrative appeal.
Mow, in 1924, Congress decided that the administrative
appeal was not a sufficient remedy for the taxpayers, because
essentially it was conducted by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue employees.

They established, an independent forum for

the review of these cases, and it was called the Board of
Tax Appeals.
Mow, the important thing to remember is that the
jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals was roughly equivalent
to this administrative appeal, and again because there would
be a delay, possible delay, in the Board of Tax Appeals
proceeding and the Commissioner was not permitted in general
to assess or collect taxes while the Board of Tax Appeals
proceeding was being invoked, Congress again provided this
kind of proviso, that is, despite the fact that you have the
Board of Tax Appeal proceeding, that the Commissioner could
assess and collect taxes even though the taxpayer had invoked
the jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals.
Now, that essentially in our view demonstrates two
things: Numer one, it demonstrates that the termination

provision and the early assessment provision, which originated
the proviso, are entirely separate provisions, and they
shouldn’t be merged.
Now, one of the assumptions, one of the basic
assumptions upon which the decision of the Sixth Circuit here
and the decision of the Fifth Circuit in Clark v. Campbell
rest is that the Commissioner’s assessment authority in a
termination case derives from Section 68SI, this early
assessment provision, and that the Commissioner can’t — that
in effect the early assessment provision must be invoked as
part of the termination process.
demonstrates that is not so.

But as the statutory history

The early assessment provision

came in simply as an exception to the administrative appeal
procedure, and that administrative appeal procedure as
Congress later sort of transformed it into the jurisdiction
of the Board of Tax Appeals was never intended as the statutes
indicate to cover these termination cases.
Nov;, I have five minutes left.

I would prefer to

save it for rebuttal unless the Court has any further questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Very well.

Mr. Smith, the one word in Section 6851.

which is set forth on page 60 of your brief, the last two
lines on page 60 it talks about "effectual proceedings to
collect tiie income tax.”
"unless such proceedings."

Then on the next line on page 61,
Your view, then, would be that

word "proceedings" refers to proceedings under 6401«
MR. SMITH:

Well, in other words, these are summary

administrative proceedings.

These are the proceedings that

connote assessment and the levying power and restraint power
under Section 6331.

In other words, first you have your

determination and then you have administrative acts proceedings,
so to speak, which include the sections under 6201, and if
the taxpayer refuses then to pay, the involuntary means of
extracting payment by levy and restraint.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

But under 6351 you have already levied.
No, no, no.

We haven't levied.

The

levy provision is in Section 6331 on page 57 of our brief.
All Section 6351 authorizes the Commissioner to do is to
terminate someone's taxable year and then determine that an
amount is due,immediately due and payable.

Oust on that

statutory language alone, collection cannot be effected.

For

the collection to be effected, the Commissioner then has to
make the administrative act of recording the taxpayer's tax
liability on the Service's books of account as an assessment,
and once having taken that act, which is entitled to tremendous
presumption of correctness and operates very much like a civil
judgment, than the Commissioner presents that assessment to
the taxpayer and says, "Pay this assessment," and if he.
doesn't pay, then the Commissioner must invoke other statutory
remedies to effect collection.

But G851 simply authorises termination and a
determination of an amount immediately due and payable, because
without that statute, the taxes would not be due
and payable until the following Aprilo
QUESTION;

What section specifically, was it 6331,

authorized you to seize the money in the Laing case?
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Immediately without saying word one, you

just seise it.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

Without saying — I’m not sura exactly —
What did you do before you seized the

money?
MR. SMITH:

What did we do before the money?

We

seized the money and made an assessment and we asked the
taxpayer to pay the assessment.
QUESTION:

But 6331 at least starts out by saying

pay the same within 10 days."
MR. SMITH:

Oh, yes, but if you look down at the

bottom it says if the Secretary or his delegate makes the
finding that the collection of such taxes is in jeopardy, notice
and demand for immediate payment may be made.

Upon failure

or refusal to pay, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful
without regard to the 10-day period provided in the section.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Heavrin.

~-i V J

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD M. LIEAVRIN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ELIZABETH JANE HALL
MR. IiEAVRIHs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court, I am Don Heavrin, the attorney for Elizabeth Jane
Hall, the respondent in the case of the United States v.
Elizabeth Jane Hall.
I would like to start out and say tills morning that
the issue simply stated is what restrictions, if any, are there
on the Internal Revenue Service when the Internal Revenue
Service undertakes to collect tax that the Service believes
is due and owing.
Now under the Code, section 6203 provides that the
Regional Director can issue an assessment, and the way he
issues the assessment is by writing in the ledger in the
Regional Director's office the name of the taxpayer and the
amount of money that's owed.
The interesting aspect of this mechanical procedure
is that as soon as the Regional Director makes the entry and
writes down your name, as Mr.. Smith said, that's very akin to
a civil judgment.

In fact, it has the same weight because

as soon as that entry is made, the taxpayer at that moment is
in debt to the United States Government for whatever amount
the Regional Director puts in the book.
Now, the Regional Director can make this entry
without any particular knowledge about the taxpayer.

He can

44

make this entry without any evidence whatsoever that the
taxpayer owes the money.

In other words,- he can choose any

person and any amount and put it in the book under 6203 and
at that moment the taxpayer becomes indebted to the United
States.
Now, I would submit to this Court that such a situation
is dangerous under the best of conditions.

But the danger is

greatly magnified when the Government is not making a sincere
effort to collect taxes.

In the case at bar the Government

had no interest in Mrs. Hall's tax liability.

What the IRS

was doing was endeavoring to punish Mrs. Hall nonjudicially
for an activity that they had concluded that she was involved
in.

And they elected to punish Mrs. Hall because of the

Presidential directive which is reproduced in the appendix of
our brief for the then President of the United States, Mr.
Nixon, suggested that anyone who is suspected of being involved
in the drug trafficking, the Government use the most vigorous
procedures imaginable to enforce the collection of taxes.
Now, the trap, as I said in the brief, was set and
through fortuity of circumstances, Mrs. Hall stepped into the
trap and the Government presented her the $52,000 tax bill
and they said, "Pay up."
QUESTION;
bit opaque.

I find that trap description a little

Do you mean that the informants informed the

police and then the police informed the Internal Revenue?

MR. HEAVRIN:

No.

The reliable informant that fir.

Smith referred to was not a reliable informant.
was not involved in any illegal drug trafficking.

Mrs. Hall
Mrs. Hall

was residing quietly at her rental home in Shelby County,
Kentucky, when the Internal Revenue Service showed up and
said, "Pay this bill."
Mow, she was trapped by fortuity of circumstances.
Her husband was arrested, prosecuted and convicted, and the
State trooper Powers, who is referred to in my brief, for
some reason which I have never been able to determine,
concluded that Mrs. Hall must likewise be involved in her
husband's illegal activities.

So he obtained a search warrant

and went out and thoroughly searched Mrs. Hall9 s premises.
The search produced two narcotic — not narcotic substances,
but two control substances.

One of -them was less than one

gram of hashish, and one was one amphetamine crystal.

Both

of these narcotic substances v/ere not the property of Mrs.
Hall, but were substances that had been used by her husband
and Mrs. Hall quite frankly felt that they had all been
removed from her home.

The husband's difficulty had caused

some marital problems — I don't want to go outside the record
but I am trying to explain to your Honors what led up to this.
Nov/, when the Government showed up and presented
the tax bill to Mrs. Hall, the bill was approximately ten time
her entire worth.

Now, in the questioning from Mr. Justice

46
Blacknam and Hr, Justice White., I see that the Court is
understanding and seising on the issue,

Now* Mr. Smith says

it’s a very simple matter for the taxpayer to go into the
United States District Court after he has filed a tax return.
But the insidious and extremely dangerous thing about this
situation is that the tax bill continues.

So when they

deliver the $52,000 tax bill to Mrs. Hall, they seised her
Volkswagen. They take it, they immediately put it up for sale,
which is exactly what happened in this case.

Assume for the

purposes of this argument the sale of the Volkswagen produces
a thousand dollars.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with due respect

to the Court, I think that that is a correct statement of the

exactly what status Mr. Laing is in.

I don't know

I do know that the two

taxpayers are in radically different positions because the
money that was assessed against Mr. Laing was available, but
the money that was assessed against Mrs. Hall was not available.
So my research has not been directed towards the issue of
what happens if the money is available and can be readily
paid, my research has been directed towards what happens if
the money cannot be paid.
QUESTION:

I read the Fifth Circuit's opinion where

they ruled in your client's favor as simply saying the
Government had to issue a notice of deficiency and not going
on to say that your client was entitled to relief of restraint.

MR, HEAVRIN:

No.

I think that if we take a look

at the €213, the taxpayer can file for redetermination within
90 days.

And then if we look at 6321 for the lien for the

taxes and a person refuses to pay and so on and then 6331 which
is levy and restraint, and then 6335 which is sale of seised
property, I think that an examination of those sections will
reveal that the collection procedures stop.
Now, I'm not so much concerned about the Volkswagen,
you see, that was taken.

continuing collection procedures.

The Government sends

The door to Tax Court is open.

Within the 90-day period the taxpayer files the suit.

When

the suit is filed for the redetermination of the deficiency,
assume they sold the Volkswagen and there is $51,000 still
owed.

When she files the suit, that prevents the IRS from

then trying to collect the other $51,000 until the deficiency
has been redetermined. And thi3 is the protection —

the absurdity — go ahead, sir.

QUESTION?
Blackmun.

Welly I may have interrupted Mr. Justice

Let me make this observation to you.

I think you

probably sensed during Mr. Smith's argument a feeling on the
part of several members of the Court that the revenues weren’t
in jeopardy and all we were talking about was a notice of
deficiency and a fairly close legal question that the
Government wasn't prejudiced and the taxpayer was being
denied an opportunity to litigate, that there was some reason
in a close case to resolve that in favor of the taxpayer.
But now you in effect are arguing that the revenues
will be in jeopardy, that this man who had $300,000 in the
suitcase in the engine compartment will just be free to .leave
the country until his tax determination is finally determined.
Now, that puts the equity in quite a different situation.
MR. HEAVRINs
the equity.

Yes, I agree with you that that shifts

If I could say that this is probably a two- or

three-tierad argument, one, in my case I think the facts are
so radically different.

Mrs. Hall was making no effort to

leave the country.

I can’t argue with your logic that if you

catch someone at the border who is trying to get out of the
coxmtry, the Government should have the right to seise the
property and hold it until such time as the actual tax
liability can be litigated.
But I’m not entirely sure that that analogy applies
to a taxpayer who is not trying to depart the country.

In

other words, if the Court holds the way you are thinking, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, this could produce some incredible inequity.
In Mrs. Hall’s case, when she filed a 1973 tax return, the
Government after the most scrupulous audit imaginable refunded
her $77 in taxes.

So it v;as clear that at no time did she

owe $52,000 tax bill or anything like that.

So when the

Government —

is not continually impoverished.

again and again and again throughout the course of the
litigation, they could continue to strip Mrs» Hall of every
dime that she made.

But in the Clark case and in the Irving

case and in the Lalng case, there wasn’t any additional
money being taken from the taxpayer.
Am I making myself clear, Mr. Justice Powell?

In

other words, they took what they found, the $300,000, and

Wow, what

If they had assessed

$50,000 and she had $50,000, then she could continue her
life in a normal way while the Government held onto the money.

and they took everything she had and everything she had did
not satisfy the amount of the assessment.

two, if they are allowed to do it and they are allowed to take
the taxpayer's property as security while the litigation gees
on, then we are entitled to go into Tax Court and there is a
sum of money, $100, the Government says you owe $100, they
take the $100.

Then you litigate in Tax Court and the

Government continues to hold the $100 as security to make
sure that the taxpayer does not squander it.

But if the

Government says you owe $200 and you only have the $100 and
we do not get in Tax Court, in other words, if they pick a
figure that's bigger than the total assets of the taxpayer, a
figure is chosen that exceeds the total assets of the
taxpayer, that puts the taxpayer in a much worse position
Mr. Justice Blackmun, than it would if they seised an amount
of tax because then that would be in one lump sum and one
ball, so to speak, that they could fight over.

But if the

amount assessed was ten times greater than what she had, as
she continued to work to pay the rent and as she continued to
work to buy food and so on, as you have described, the
Government would continue to strip her of her additional
income.

So if the Government can wrap it up in a package

$300,000 in a suitcase under the hood of a car and put

the suitcase in the safe and fight it out over that without
affecting Mr. Laing's other income-making potential, I think
that's a different situation than when the Government makes

What does that do to your constitutional

If the Government can hold the property which it

has already seized?
MR. HEAVRIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, our District

Judge in his wisdom said this is highly impractical.

The

Government couldn’t derive more than a thousand for the
ssle of the car and that isn’t even going to make a dent in
the tax bill.

Mrs. Hall needs to get to and from work so

he said if you will post a bond that will equal the approximate
value of the car, we will let you have it back.

So we got

a corporate surety company, we went over and posted the bond
on the Volkswagen and Mrs. Hall has had it in her possession

and has been driving it ever since.

If the Court decides in

our favor, I don't think there will be any enormous repercussions
anywhere because the status quo will simply be maintained.
Mrs. Hall will continue to drive her 1970 Volkswagen.

completely concluded, apparently to the satisfaction of the
Internal Revenue Service and to the satisfaction of the
taxpayer.

QUESTIONS

I thought that the question before us

has come up narrower and somewhat different, that is, whether
after a termination by the Commissioner there is an obligation
to send a deficiency notice, and a consequent opportunity for
the taxpayer to go to the Tax Court*
MR. HEAVRIN:
definitely.

Yes,

That is before the Court,

The question of whether further collections can

be made during that period of time is a collateral issue, but
it's vital because if the Government is allowed to continue
its collection or seizures during the pendency of the action,
when the taxpayer does not have the money to pay the assessment,
Mrs. Hall would have been forced into indigency and been kept
there.

She would have been on y/elfare because nothing that

she would have produced could have been applied to the rent,

The third tier is the thing is

It’s more or less an equity situation and

it's not an easy case because the Code is extremely complicate
and the Government has first used one section, then another,
and then argue that the history and the aspects of these
things — I think the codal argument alone defeats the
Government's position.
For example, in the codal argument, if you read
Section 6201, that grants assessment authority for taxes that
are to be paid by stamps.

And the Government continues to

ignore that provision in Chapter A of 6201.

Then the last

sentence of the first paragraph says, the authority for the
Secretary to assess taxes shall extend to, and it lists four
other situations.

But none of those situations equal or

approach or approximate what we have in the case at bar.

I

Mr.

Smith said that even a fair reading of the Code illustrates
that the Government is correct.

I think that a fair reading

of the Code indicates the opposite is true.

I can’t get it

through my thick head that 6201 really gives them the authority
to make assessments in jeopardy situations.
I think I have covered about everything I want to.
Oh, one interesting aspect which the Second Circuit
suggested that a bond be posted, and the Government
Smith argued

that the bond aspect was viable.

Mr.

Well, assume

that it is viable, 6863 is the Code section that provides
for the posting of bonds.

But Section 6863 does not refer

to Section 6851 in the Code, It refers to 6861 of the Code.
So the Government is saying under S851 situation you can post
a bond, but really the Code provides for the posting of a
bond only under 6861 situation.

Precisely the question, your Honor.

He

would jeopardize any kind of an assessment against anyone.
All he had was the fact that, as he says,- there was $310,000
attempting to be taken out of the country,

Laing who admits ownership of the money.

Laing doesn’t deny it.

No, your Honor, against each of them,
A total of almost $600,000.

MR. OTERI:

They assessed $930,000 worth of

assessments, based on finding $310,000 in money.

Then they

give us a break and they reduce it to $195,000 against each,
and what do they do to us?

We didn't file a tax return shewing

zero tax liability because it's our contention that our client
did not earn the money in the United States and no tax is
due.

But not only do we not have a forum,in an attempt to

get a forum to prove this, we file for a refund, and what
do they tell us?

We say we have $114,000 coming to us fellows.

They say no, we have assessed the $300,000 taken in the
following manner;

$100,100 each to each of the three o£ you

Now, I am here with a refund suit filed and I am

QUESTION:

When you

speak of these concessions by Laing that it was ail his money

MR. OTERI:
QUESTION:

That's right»
Where would the Government be if later

on the other two people came into the litigation and said,
Oh, no, it's ours, and it's our money, and, if any, our
tax liability.

Do you suggest that the Government is bound

by a concession made by Mr. Laing at that time?
MR. OTERX:

I don't suggest that it’s bound by it

in a strictly legal sense, your Honor, but I do suggest, one,
that as the Government must have some valid basis for making
some form of a seizure of a person's property.

I think Mr.

Laing has the equal right to say the property is mine and
it’s no one else but mine.

I think if we are going to give

the Government the right to without any kind of a hearing
and this is probably the only case or the only situation under
the Code, the short year jeopardy taxpayer is probably the
only person with no forum he can go to under the codal
provisions.

And yet you allow his property to be taken with

no kind of preliminary hearing.
Maybe, your Honor, X say just assuming arguendo,
maybe the Government has a right because this man was leaving
the country and he had the money and there was a good chance

that the Government was going to lose its ability to collect
the tax -if in fact one was owed ,

Maybe the Government has the

right to seize that property, and upon Seising it, I maintain
that due process demands that the petitioner in this case ba
given a meaningful hearing at a meaningful time in a meaningful
place.

And by that I mean within at least 30 days the

Government should go.before some judicial officer and allow
the defendant, the petitioner, to be there and convince that
officer that basically the money is in jeopardy.

MR. OTERI:

Yes.
I haven't gone ahead on the refund suit

because we have agreed to wait until there is an adjudication
of this case.

You didn't have to agree, did you?
I didn’t have to, sir, but if I didn't

I'm here in front of you on what I think is the basic remedy

Government did not give us the deficiency notice which it's
required by law to give us.
QUESTION:

MR. OTERI:

MR. OTERI;

I!m not assuming it, your Honor.

I can

only say again, your Honor —
QUESTIONS

Had you gone in, we would know that and

you might be here on that route.
MR. OTERIs
QUESTIONS

I very well might be, your Honor.
Instead of now seeking an advisory opinion

from the Court.
MR. OTERIs

Well, I don't think it's really an

advisory opinion, your Honor, in the sense that I am asking
you to say that the Government is required to issue a
deficiency notice when it makes a short-year termination under
6851.

And it's failure to make that vitiates their seizure

of my client's money.

And I am entitled to have that injunction

granted to return that money to me.
QUESTION;

Does the giving of that deficiency notice

require that the Government return the money to you?
MR. OTERI:

No, your Honor, it doesn't.

But what it

does do is it then, if they give me a deficiency notice now,
your Honor, I don't think it does.

But if in fact you find

they were required to give me a deficiency notice by statute,
as I think they are, then I think that would compel the
District Court Judge to grant my injunction and return the
money to me.
I know the Court is probably reluctant to return the
money, but I do think that's —

QUESTION:
MR. CTERIj

What makes you think that?
Well# I certainly — we are all

interested in protecting the revenue of the United States,
your Honor.

I as a taxpayer —

QUESTION:

You think this is just a matter of equity

that the Government has omitted a statutory duty, they just
ought to give the money back.
MR, OTERI:

Yes.

It's more than a matter of omitting

a statutory duty, your Honor.

I think it goes beyond that.

I think they have encroached upon a serious right of a
citizen or non-citizen who has the same rights as a citizen.
They have denied him any kind of summary hearing where he can
justify his possession of that money.

They have deprived him

of his property for 30 months, your Honor, for almost two and
a half years thus far, without any interest, maybe they pay
6 percent or something if he gets it back.

But the fact of

the matter is the man has been really reduced to a status
of poverty because of this kind of action.

And I think of

all the cases, your Honor, Kelly v. Goldberg and all the
rest of them where this Court has said some kind of a hearing
before a property right is terminated.
QUESTION;
MR. OTERI;

Or at least immediately thereafter.
At least immediately thereafter.

I say

this may be one of the few, very few exceptions, your Honor.
I am in a very untenable position in that everything about me

74
cries out that you can't take property rights away from a
person without a prior hearing.
But in this case 1 think maybe -there is some justifica­
tion because of the fact that the man was leaving the country
with the money.

But I think that if in fact this is one of

those exceptions that have been recognized,, there must be
engrafted on that type of a ruling a requirement that within
a meaningful time and place he has an opportunity to get an
answer to those three questions as to the validity of the
assessment, the amount, and the rest of it, your Honor

whether

or not the money was earned in the United States and it was in
fact in jeopardy

that.

He doesn't, but the Government's know

When you look at a case like Rimieri which was decided

in New York, your Honor, you see that a Frenchman was arrested
in the United States with $247,000 on him.

After 46 months

he"finally got a hearing and a tax agent by the name of Mr.
Silver was asked on cross-examination what was the basis for
the assessment, and he hemmed and he hawed through a number of
answers and finally he was forced to state that the basis for
the assessment was that was the amount of money the man had,
that's what he was told to assess and that’s what he assessed.
And I maintain that's exactly what happened in my case, only in
my case they took $310,000 because there were three people they

?s
multiplied it by three.

Well, if that kind of conduct can foe

countenanced on the part of tbs IRS, I maintain there is
substantial due process violations, and I think for that
reason, if for no other reason, this man should have his money
returned and should be at least granted a hearing within 30
days of any seizure in the future.

Because, among other things,

you are talking about statutes of limitations.

One of the

things X have to be afraid of in this case, your Honor, is that
if in fact the money is returned to me as counsel for this
man, I think the Government has the right to reseise it.

That

happens to be one of the options that I think is available to
the Government.
The otiier question you were talking about statutes of
limitations, the Government has three years in which to issue
a notice of deficiency.

That three years has not expired yet.

They still have not issued the notice to me.

I think that

was another one of the statutory questions you were asking.
At this time, your Honor, if I could, address
myself briefly to the problem,

the statutory problem, such

as it is, this short-year termination was made under the aegis
of 6351 of the Code.

That's a section of the Code entitled

But none­

They go to that for

section (d) of that particular statute which in effect directs
the —- section 6201(d) specifically states the special rules
applicable to deficiencies of income, et cetera, see subchapter
(b), subchapter (b) being Section 6211 to 6216.
When you go to Section 6216 of the Code, your Honor,
Section 6216(2) they say, procedures relating to jeopardy
assessments see subchapter (a) of chapter 70.

In effect what

we are saying is the Government, whexx you follow its argument
to its cmoplstion, had they included that section (d) in their
brief referring them to section 6216, you would find that
they make a complete circle.

They start under the jeopardy

assessment provision of chapter 70, subtitle (a), they go to
6201, they get sent to 6216, which sends them back to chapter 70„
I think it's pretty obvious if they are going to make
an assessment under 6251, it has to be done under -the authority
of 6261 — 6861, I’m sorry, your Honor.
Now, why don't they want to assess under 686.1, which
is the next following statute?

They terminate your short year

under 6851, but they don’ t have the authority to assess under
that —
QUESTION;

You say it’s the next following step .

There is a provision in the Code, isn't there, that says the

77
juxtaposition of sections after all these revisions isn't to
be given any great weight.
MR. OTERI:

Absolutely* your Honor.

I don't in any

way say that because it follows it, it invariably means that
it has to be applied.

But

when you look at both of them under

the jeopardy heading, both of them concerning jeopardy assess­
ments, there being no other sections concerning jeopardy
assessments, X think you would have to be somewhat blinded not
to feel there must be some correlation between the two of them.
And practically, your Honor, if in fact the Government
doesn't use 6861, they are in effect avoiding the necessity
of giving the taxpayer a deficiency notice which allows him
to go into the Tax Court for an adjudication.
exactly why they don’t want to use 6861.

And that's

They would much

rather take a taxpayer's assets and deny him the right to go
to the Tax Court for any kind of a prepayment or any kind of
an even post payment decision.
Thank you very much.
QUESTION;

Mr. Oteri, what is your answer to the

question that was showered on your co-counsel.

If you have

a way into the Tax Court, is the Government forthwith restrained
from levy?
MR. OTERI;

If you have a way into the Tax Court?

Well, your Honor, again, in a short-year jeopardy assessment,
it's my feeling that they can assess but they cannot restrain.

And I think when you see in

fact that it's really a means of law enforcement, of punishment,
not a means of obtaining revenue for the Government, you then
see the necessity for putting an impartial magistrate between
the Government and the citizenry of the United States.
QUESTION:

Of course, your client's case,

quite

different from Mrs. Hall's perhaps, does suggest that the
Government may have been motivated by a desire to protect the
revenue.
MR. OTERI:

I don’t dispute that at all, your Honor.

79
1 just say that if that is true, if in fact that’s true, there

is no reason why they couldn’t seise the money and hold it for
a reasonable period of time, 30 days, 20 days, some such time
where they have to go before a judge.

All I want is a judge,

somebody who had sit there and say, "Look, fellows, you’re not
acting in accordance with the constitutional standards of the
United States."

When you have to go to the Commissioner of

Internal Revenue who may be a great guy, I don’t even know
his name, he may be a wonderful man, but ha is still the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and he is still a lav;
enforcement officer, and he still is helping enforce a
situation that in fact may well have terminated by now, but
he is still a law enforcement.

And when there is law enforce­

ment on one side, there is no impartial determination.

The

way I see things in the best interests of my client, he sees
them in the best interest of the Government.

fellow in a black robe who has no interest, who merely wants
to see justice done in the abstract, and I think we have got

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Oteri.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Smith?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH GM
BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. SMITH:

Just a few points, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that the record in both these cases cannot
support any inference that the Commissioner's efforts in this
regard are anything but tax collection efforts»

There is no

suggestion on these records that these c^ses involve any
harassment.

Indeed, the Court last term in Bob Jones University

and American United said simply that you cannot impute that
kind of motivation other than tax collecting efforts to the
Commissioner without a solid factual foundation.
QUESTION:

In the Hall case,maybe I misunderstand it,

but the sum of $52,500 was assessed.

They levied on a couple

of thousand dollars, and then at the end of the year it turned
out that she got a refund.
MR, SMITH:

Yes.

I want to make that clear.

What

happened in the Hall case was she filed a tax return reporting
$530 of gross income for the full taxable year and claiming
a refund of some $76 on taxes withheld.

Now, the Commissioner

was subject to an injunction by the District Court which was
affirmed in the Sixth Circuit in Hall which said that he was
not permitted to take any tax collection steps against her
for the assessment for the terminated period.
It was determined that unless the refund was paid,
because no stay v/as sought, that the Commissioner might well
be in contempt of the district court's order.
was paid.

So that amount

That payment in no way connotes that the Commissloner

is satisfied that Mrs. Hall has fully complied with her tax

81
liability for the year 1973»

To the contrary, it was simply

made in order to avoid any suggestion that the Internal
Revenue Service might be violating a court order by applying
the $76 claimed to the amount of the assessment.
I think I want to make something else clear because
there seems to be some confusion on the point of the effect
of the filing of the notices of deficiency.

The effect of

filing of a notice of deficiency in a jeopardy situation
does not restrain

and an indication of Tax Court jurisdiction

does not restrain the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from
continuing to collect taxes.

If you look at Section 6213(a)

which is set forth at page 56 of Appendix A of our brief,
you see that there is an exception down at the last three
lines, "Except as otherwise provdided in section 6861 no
assessment of a deficiency," and so forth and so on.

So

the jeopardy situation is an exception to the normal rule
that a Tax Court proceeding stays collection.
But what I want to emphasize —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Will you give us that reference again.
6213(a), page 56 of our brief,
Thank you.
But what I want to emphasize here is

that what this case really involves is a congressional decision
to allocate jurisdiction

in these particular cases to the

district courts and not to the Tax Court.

And, indeed, sending

82
a notice of deficiency* to the taxpayers, as I think the Court
is well aware, doesn't really provide them with any particular
benefit.
QUESTION;

What is the earliest possible time,

assuming you are right, that he has to go to the district
court that he could ever get anybody to rule, a judicial officer
to rule on even that there was probable cause to believe that
you were right — probable cause to believe that a taxpayer ■—
MR. SMITH;

The earliest possible time, I suppose,

is the day after the levy and collection was made, the taxpayer
could file claim for refund with the District Director's
office —
QUESTION;

I know, but he could hardly — it takes

him, what, six months?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;

That’s the maximum.
Well, the taxpayer can't go to court

until he gets turned down, and he can take six months to do it.
MR. SMITH;

The Commissioner can take six months

under I think it’s section 6532.

And then he can file a

complaint the day after that.,
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH:

So is six months the earliest possible time?
Quite frankly, I think on the basis of

what the Court said a moment ago in the Phillips case, I
think that that constitutes an adequate post-collection
judicial remedy.

£33

QUESTION:

That may be for the total resolution of the

case, X mean for a decision on the merits.

But there is no

way that anybody can even, that plainly erroneous levy
assessments could be sorted out.
MR. SMITH:

That's not quite so, because the court

audit people were aware of the fact that if something is
completely without any foundation, this Court has created an
exception to the Anti-Injunction Act in the Williams Packing
case.

That is if a taxpayer could demonstrate that under no

circumstances could the Government prevail on the merits of
its claim and that its equity jurisdiction otherwise exists.
So there is that narrow remedy for the case in which the
Commissioner has made a totally wild and unsupported claim.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12 noon, the oral arguments in the
above-entitled matters were concluded.)
