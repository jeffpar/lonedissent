PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No 73-1596, Robert E. Hampton against Mow Sun Wong.
Mr. Solicitor General, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
We are here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth
Circuit.
Respondents are four aliens who have been denied
employment with the Federal Competitive Civil Service by
reason of the Commission’s — the Civil Service Commission’s
regulation requiring that applicants for most positions be
either citizens of the United States or persons owing
allegiance.
Respondents filed a class action challenging the
regulation on constitutional and other grounds.
The District Court, on the government’s motion,
dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.

The

Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the regulation
violates the Equal Protection Component of the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The Court said that alienage is a suspect
c-uassification so that the compelling governmental interest

must be shown to justify treating the aliens differently
than citizens with respect to federal employment.
The Court of Appeals relied, we believe mistakenly,
on the rationale of this Court’s decisions in Sugarman versus
Dougall and Graham against Richardson.
Those cases concerned, of course, state restriction
on the eligibility of aliens for state employment and sate
welfare benefits.
It is our contention that the Civil Service
Commission’s regulation is a valid exercise of the national
power and I reach that result in alternative ways.
My first submission is that the Equal Protection
principle has no application to the Federal Government’s
dealing with aliens as aliens.

It has application, of

course, to them in other capacities.

I wish to be quite

clear about this.
The Equal Protection principle applies to persons
who are aliens and it protects them from a variety of
inequalities such as inequalities imposed on the grounds of
their race or religion but the Equal Protection principle
does not apply, we think, to a pure alienage

classification

such as that before us.
QUESTION:

That is, the Equal Protection principle

of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.
In other words, when it is the Federal Government

5
that is making the classifications.
MR. BORK:
Stewart.

That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice

When it is — everything I am talking about now is

in the federal context.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BORK:

And I am at some pains to point out

what apparently has not been fully understood by Respondents,
that we are not saying that the Equal Protection principle
does not apply against the Federal Government
who is an alien.

to a person

Of course it does.

We are only saying it does not apply to him in
his capacity as alien.

It may apply to him in his capacity

whether It is race or religion or sex. —
QUESTION:

Or age.

MR. BORK:

Or age or some other way in which the

Equal Protection principle applies and, of course, other
constitutional protections apply to aliens so we are not
contending any such —making any such broad claim.
The reason we think that the Equal Protection
component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment
can’t apply Is because of the plenary powers of the national
sovereign with respect to alienage.
Our Constitution does not forbid alienage
classifications.

On the contrary, the Constitution requires

the Federal Government, though not the states, to employ

6
alienage classifications.
Now, my alternative submission will be that at
most — at most.» the Equal Protection Clause principle has a
very attenuated application to distinctions between citizens
and aliens when those distinctions are made by the Federal
Government.
To employ the compelling governmental interest
standard, as the Court of Appeals did, is, I think, effectively
to destroy the distinction between citizens and aliens
contained in the Constitution or much of it and certainly to
destroy much of the great mass of legislation which
distinguishes between citizens and aliens.
Some indication of that mass of legislation is
contained in the Appendix to the government’s brief.
For the Federal Government, alienage cannot be a
suspect classification because the Constitution gives the
Federal Government the power and, indeed, the duty to make
that classification and to legislate with respect to it and
that is a power and a duty that, of course, the states

do not

have.
This necessarily means, I think, that if the Equal
Protection principle has any application here — and I think
it does not — it is satisfied by meeting the Rational Basis
test and I will argue later that the challenged regulation
here clearly meets the Rational Basis Test.

7
But first I want to argue that we ought not to
apply the Equal Protection test at all in

this case.

We

have here an exercise by the Civil Service Commission of
the delegated combined powers of the Congress and the
President and those powers, of course, relate to natural­
ization, foreign policy, national defense, treaty-making and
so forth.
And, in fact, what has been exercised here seems
to me a power inherent in the idea of the sovereignty of a
nation's state, the power to distinguish between those who
owe an allegiance and those who do not.

And so obviously

is this power to differentiate between those who oxve alle­
giance and those who do not an attribute of sovereignty
that the practice in question here is followed by every
nation in the world.
And so obviously is this an attribute of
sovereignty that it has been exercised and gone uncontested
for more than 90 years which fact, I think, gives the
regulation all the support that long-continued and
universally-accepted usage can confer.
These factors seem to me to make this case
completely different from Sugarman versus Dougall and
Graham against Richardson.
sovereigns.

States are not independent

They have no power to regulate naturalization,

no power to conduct

foreign affairs5 to decide what is

8
required by national defense, no power to make treaties.
Nothing in the Constitution gives them the right
explicitly granted to the Federal Government of treating
alienage as a proper classification for legislation.
If alienage is a suspect classification for state
law, it is constitutionally made a proper and, indeed, an
inevitable classification for federal law.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, has Congress passed an Act

giving the states the right to discriminate against aliens?
MR. BORK:

No, I think not, Mr. Justice Marshall,

because that would be, if Congress passed a law giving the
states the power of what they wished to do with respect to
aliens, 'that would not be a federal policy with respect to
aliens, that would be simply turning over to state policy a
subject that does not belong to state policy.
QUESTION:

So there is a limitation on Congress*

authority over aliens?
MR. BORK:

On, there are many limitations,

Mr. Justice Marshall, over the Congress' power over aliens;
not only may it not turn the power over to the states but it
must exercise itself as a national power but, obviously —
QUESTION:

Could Congress authorize the Civil

Service Commission to pay aliens less than they pay citizens?
MR. BORK:
Marshall, I would

I would think that they could, Mr. Justice

9
QUESTION

They could?

MR. BORK:

I would think that they could.

QUESTION:

Well, could Congress pass a lav; that

I —

says you can pay female aliens less than you pay other —
MR. BORK:

No, I think not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. BORK:

Well, that's my point.

The Equal

Protection principle does apply to all persons and, there­
fore, it applies to persons who also happen to be aliens.
I am not contesting that and if an alien is discriminated
against on the grounds of his race or sex or age, then he
will be treated by the Equal Protection principle just as a
citizen would be.
I am merely suggesting — arguing — that the
alienage classification is not one to which the Equal
Protection principle applies.
That is, when Congress legislates as to all
aliens, Equal Protection does not apply.

When it legislates

as to aliens who are women, it does apply.
QUESTION:

So you say that the work laxvs of the

United States do not apply to aliens?
MR. BORK:

I think it can, Mr. Justice Marshall.

Indeed, we have a variety —
QUESTION:

Doesn’t your little niche that they can

do whatever they want on employment but not anything else?

10
MR. BORK:

I hadn't thought of it that way and I —

I don't believe, your Honor, that I am — that I am dividing
it by employment as against something else.
I hadn't — I hadn’t thought of it that way and of
course much of the legislation about aliens is not legislation
about employment.
QUESTION:

One of the first cases was about

MR. BORK:

Yes, the — that was a state regulation

I think we have never had a —

QUESTION:

Was there any case before that that had

anybody ‘else in a suspect classification?

Wasn't the alien

the first one that they made suspect?
MR. BORK:

Well, I don't know If the language was

used before that, Mr. Justice Marshall, but it seems to me
that we have always known, from the inception of the 14th
Amendment, that race was the primary suspect classification
in our Constitution.
Now, I don't know about when the rhetoric of suspect
classification began,

I do not know.

And when that particular

formulation of the —
QUESTION:

Umn hmn, right.

MR. BORK:

— problem began I do not know.

But I think the distinction between the state and
the federal is shown by when you look at the — when you

11
move from state law to federal law, you also move from
cases like Sugarman and Graham to Oases like Harislades
against Shaughnessy, Kleindlenst against Mande1 and so
forth, cases that uphold the most severe kinds of restric­
tions upon aliens and from the early cases on we have known
this Court has said that Congress has power in this field
and, in fact, it has as much or more power in this field
than it has in other legislative fields.
There is no place where Congress' power is more
complete than in this one.
QUESTION:

Now —

That language, that — not only

language but those thoughts you find basically in immigration
and deportation cases.
MR. BORK:

That is entirely correct, Mr, Justice

Stewart, and I am fully aware, of course, that the power
of Congress is at its strongest when it is choosing to
exclude a class of immigrants or to deport but I think that
decision to admit or exclude is necessarily intertwined
with decisions about aliens' rights and obligations here.
For one thing, this case could be recast, if
Congress so desired, I would suppose, to say that the
condition of entry into the United States is not to apply
for federal employment until you have been naturalized and
that we would then have the same thing.
In fact, I am not sure that for that reason this

12
regulation doesn’t have all the force that law woulci have.
For another thing, decisions about how many to
admit, under what terms and so forth, the standards for
naturalization are necessarily influenced by Congress’
ability to control the package of rights and obligations
that the alien has while here and again, we see that in the
Constitution itself, indeed, in the 14th Amendment which
gives birth to the Equal Protection principle in our
constitutional jurisprudence, there is a distinction between
aliens and citizens which is a distinction made as to aliens
and citizens in this country, riot for purposes of immigration.
And I will leave the discussion of that distinction
to our brief and merely point out that Congress has adjusted
this package of rights and obligations that aliens and
citizens have again and again, throughout our history and I
think that now, to begin to apply for the first time the
Equal Protection principle in the way that the Respondents
ask itfould severely hamper Congress’ power, destroy it in
many respects and it would be a major Constitutional innova­
tion without any warrant in the Constitutional text, in its
history or, indeed, in policy.
There is for that reason, I think, only one fully
satisfactory formulation of the law with respect to resident
aliens and I would say it is this and I have said it before
but I will stress it as I leave the point:

The Equal

13
Protection principle applies to persons who also are aliens
but it does not apply to them in their status as aliens.

In

any other status they occupy, the Equal Protection principle
may apply to them which is to say that Congress may not
impose burdens upon resident aliens because they are white
or black or yellow or because of their religion but it may
differentiate between aliens and citizens.
Now, Congress may not deprive aliens of specific
rights guaranteed elsewhere in the Constitution.

I am not

arguing that it may.
It obviously may not imprison an alien without
due process.

It may not subject him to cruel and unusual

punishment and so forth but the one principle which is
manifestly inappropriate when the government — the Federal
Government addresses alienage as a subject is Equal
Protection because inherent in the Constitution, inherent
in the idea of nationhood, is a fundamental inequality
between citizens and aliens.
QUESTION:

What about the right to vote,

Mr. Solicitor General?
MR. BORK:

Well, I would think that would be one

of the last rights that could be opened to aliens,
Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
isn’t it?

That certainly is —Well, it can be denied and is denied,

14
MR. BORK:

It is denied, indeed,

QUESTION:

Well, that is up to the states pretty

much, isn't it?
'

MR. BORK:

Yes, it Is up to the states.

QUESTION:

That doesn’t involve the Federal

Government,
MR. BORK:

Well, I — I don’t think, Mr. Justice

QUESTION:

And some states in the past have

Stewart —

allowed aliens to vote.
MR. BORK:

There have been places where aliens have

been allowed to vote and I think it might be a delicate
Constitutional question, which I hope I need not embark on
here whether the Federal Government would have, in that circum'
stance, If the qualifications --QUESTION:

The power to overrule the judgment of

MR. BORK:

The power to overrule —

QUESTION:

It has never exercised it.

MR. BORK:

Mo.

QUESTION:

In this area.

MR. BORK:

That is right, Mr. Justice Stewart.

QUESTION:

With respect to aliens.

MR. BORK:

And I think — I think I would reserve

the state.

that as a possibility but it has no bearing I think upon our

15
present Inquiry.
Now, I think this is the logical answer to our
case but

should this Court determine that the Equal

Protection principle is applicable, I continue nonetheless
to believe that this Commission regulation is valid.
Under the current doctrinal formulation, the
Equal Protection applies with one of two degrees of
severity.

The federal power I have just sketched means, I

think, that the strict scrutiny mode of analysis, or the
test of compelling governmental interest is plainly
inappropriate to this subject matter.
To apply them is to effectively destroy Congress*
and the President’s undoubted powers in this field and it
is to destroy, I think, very nearly destroy, without any
warrant, the distinction between citizen and alien.
In this context, the federal power, at least, it
seems to me appropriate to note that alienage is not by any
means a permanent or immutable characteristic like race or
sex.

This disability imposed by this Commission regulation

Is both temporary and it is quite limited.
Naturalization and the privileges of citizenship
are available in five years to an alien and in three if the
alien marries a citizen.
Nov/, each of the Respondents in this case has now
been here ~ not when they started the case but now --- has

16
now been here long enough to qualify for citizenship.

As

far as I know, to date, none of them has applied.
One Respondent has been here for 28 years and has
not troubled to apply for citizenship and I fail to see why,
in cases like that, the benefits

should be obtained through

a lawsuit rather than through a proclamation of allegiance.
QUESTION:
the Court wasn't

Well, now, as far as that point goes,

very much moved by that argument in the

Griffiths case, where it was pretty clear that that alien
had decided she didn't ever want to become an American
citizen Tor

reasons of her ovm.

MR. BORK:

That is quite true, Mr. Justice Stewart.

The Griffiths case, of course, was, again, a state
restriction.
QUESTION:

I know it was but I am talking about the

argument you are now making.
MR. BORK:

Well, I would think if there is any

place in our policy and in our law where we are entitled to
say, a benefit is

available if you choose to proclaim

allegiance but it is not available otherwise, it would be
precisely in the area of federal employment.
QUESTION:

But this regulation makes no distinction

between aliens who are longtime aliens and aliens who ~~
MR. BORK:

Nc.

No, it does not.

QUESTION:

— hope as promptly as possible to

IT
become citizens, does it?
MR. BORK:

It does not.

QUESTION:

Right.

That is quite correct.

And I don’t know, has

Mrs. Griffiths been appointed by the federal court, under
the Criminal Justice Act?

have?

MR. BORK:

I do not know, Mr. Justice Stewart.

QUESTION:

Uh huh.

Do you know if any aliens

Any alien lawyers?
MR. BORK:

I do not know.

I don't think there are

that many of them but perhaps they have.

I do not know.

But it seems to me that there is good reason why
this regulation does not distinguish between aliens who
intend to become citizens and aliens who do not intend to
do so and why it covers both classes of aliens and I think
I will briefly explain — try to point to some of the
factors that lead me to think that this regulation, if it
must pass a rational relationship test, passes it with high
marks.
And I will cite a few things that this regulation
does which seem to me valuable and which Congress and the
President might rationally think would be valuable.
In the first place, It offers an inducement for
resident aliens to acquire knowledge of this country, to
acquire the language, to proclaim allegiance and to become
citizens and it seems to me that It is quite legitimate for

18
Congress to wish to induce aliens living here to integrate
themselves into our national life and into our political
community in this process of becoming citizens.
That seems to me to be in fact a rather obvious
exercise of the power to make rules with respect to
naturalization.
Two, it does avoid a rather large and complex
administrative burden that would be entailed by a system in
which all federal jobs were classified according to whether
or not they entail any aspect of the formulation or execution
of policy and then we had the tag —
QUESTION:
Richardson

Isn’t that the result of Sugarman and

on the state side?
MR, BORK:

Mr. Justice Biackmun.

It is the result on the state side,
I think it need not be the result on

the federal side because — as I have said, because of the
very strong federal power that exists in this area and if we
come to a rational relation test rather than a compelling
governmental interest test which was applied in Sugarman,
then I think this reason becomes important.
It may not have been enough against a compelling
governmental interest test.

I think it is — if I am correct

that, at most, a rational relationship test applies here
because the Federal Government, which has many, many employees
millions, would have to tag, I suppose, aliens so that they

19
were not by accident or Inadvertence moved to sensitive
facilities or into posts that might properly be reserved
for citizens if we had to meet this administrative burden and
I suppose there would be a great deal of litigation about
that.
And, third, the federal payroll, I think it is
proper to note, has become an important means for imple­
menting solutions to economic and social problems.
Minority groups, for one example, have been
benefited by federal affirmative action hiring that helps
to counterbalance some discrimination in the private sector
and I think it might be irrational for Congress to wish to
maximize the effectiveness of the federal payroll in this
function by confining it to citizens.
So I offer three reasons.
educed.

Others could be

The inducement to apply for citizenship and to

integrate onself in the national life and, indeed, in the
political community of this nation, the administrative
burden and the use of the federal payroll as a social
implement.
None of these objectives is impermissible or evil.
Each of them bears a rational relation to the regulation
promulgated by the Commission which means, I think, that the
regulation does not offend the Equal Protection principle.
So I come back at the end to where I began.

The

20

Compelling Governmental Interest Test can hardly be used with
respect to federal legislation or federal regulation.
That is, where the Federal Government has so much
power.
If the Equal Protection principle applies, I think
it is satisfied here.
If It does not apply, clearly the regulation is
valid and we believe that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals should be reversed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, do the Federal

Civil Service regulations accord any preferential status to
veterans now?
MR. BORK:

I am not sure about veterans in general.

Of course, I think they — yes, they do.

They do.

But I

can’t give you the details of it, Mr. Justice Powell.
In addition to that, of course, an alien who serves
has his ability to become a citizen accelerated, if he serves
honorably and there Is, I believe, a veterans perference but
I can't give you the details of how it operates.
QUESTION:

General Bork, would it he a disaster

if this case and the next one were decided oppositely?
MR, BORK:

Mr, Justice Blackmun, years of pre­

dicting the sky falling in and it never falls in has led me
to believe that very few things turn out to be unqualified
disasters.

*'

21
I think I can speak for myself and for the
government attorney, Mrs Spiro, who follows me, in saying
that it would be infinitely preferable if both of these
cases were decided as we ask.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Steinraan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. STEINMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. STEINMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Please the Court:
Counsel for the Government is suggesting that
the Ninth Circuit's opinion has carved out a novel
Constitutional argument.
His argument concerning the non-applicability of
Fifth Amendmenc protections to aliems, when the classi­
fication is on alienage, I would submit is the most novel
of arguments.
I think it is important to understand that the
four Respondents in this case were initially seeking jobs
that did not involve foreign affairs, did not involve national
security, did not involve some of the issues of sovereignty
and some of the issues of executive policy-making which was
the concern of this Court in Sugarman.
QUESTION:
approach necessitates

Do you think — do you think that that
striking the regulation down on its

22

face?

If you sought certain jobs, let’s assume you are

right.

Vfhy would the regulation be invalid on Its face?
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I think the vice of the

regulation is similar to the vice of the regulation that has
confronted this Court in Sugarman, admittedly a state case
and, as the lower court found, not squarely controlling.
The vice was the overbreadth that while there are
clearly jobs which possibly —
QUESTION:

That may be, but we are construing a

federal regulation here.

You don't strike — ordinarily, if

you can narrow a regulation or a statute, you don’t strike it
down

on its face.
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

I agree.

We don’t do that with

respect to state

statutes or regulations.
MR. STEINMAN:

I would agree that it would be ob­

viously best not to strike down a statute but the inter­
pretation of the regulation has been to automatically fore­
close at the stage of submitting the application any non
any resident alien.
I’d like to make one correction of the opening
remarks.

The regulation in question says that you must be a

citizen or owe permanent allegiance.

As the government’s

brief, page 8l note 6? of its brief indicates, the govern­
ment has Interpreted permanent allegiance to only apply to

23
American Samoans.
Now, possibly, Mr. Justice White, if the government
was more liberal in interpreting permanent allegiance, we
could say the regulation.
It has chosen not to do so.
One of the ironies of this case is that three of
the four main Respondents actually at one time worked for
the Federal Government.
Respondent Wong and

Respondent Mok were involved

in a federal state manpower program and were placed with
the General Services.
QUESTION:

It is certainly true that there are

many aliens ivorking for the Federal Government, are there
not, in other cases, in NASA and —
MR. STEINMAN:

The laws indicate that there are

exceptions for many branches of government, including the
Department of Defense, Atomic Energy Commission and NASA,
departments which arguably —*
QUESTION:

But that Is the choice of the Federal

Government, is it not?
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Clearly.

And here we are talking about the

Civil Service Commission.
MR. STEINMAN:

Exactly and the point I am wishing

to make is that these individuals

performed competently

and

performed as the Service v/ishes to promote the efficiency of
the service while working on other programs and yet, although
their supervisors of the record indicate

said they per­

formed — one performed outstandingly and the other performed
most satisfactorily, when the time came when the government
program ended, they were foreclosed totally from seeking and
continuing their job3 solely on their status as aliens.
Mr. Justice Powell raised another issue which I
would like to address your attention to on the record.

He

asked about veterans' preferences.
There is evidence in the record of a gentleman
named Mr, Bor.

It appears at the Appendix, page 31 and is

discussed at page 6 of our brief.
Mr. Bor arrived in this country as a child.

He was

drafted as the America — into the military, served for 18
months, 14 of which were in Korea, achieved the rank of
Sergeant' E-5, received an honorable discharge.
And yet when

he left the military and tried to

apply, just apply, for a job with the Postal Service — to
which had he been a citizen he would have received veteran's
preference — he was denied the opportunity to apply and as
he states in his affidavit, "Although I am qualified and loyal
enough to serve my country for two years in the military, I
am not, qualified and loyal enough to work for the Post Office."
QUESTION;

But he didn't apply for citizenship.

25
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon ?

He did not apply for citizenship?

MR. STEINMAN:

At that time he had not.

Three of

the named — of the four named Respondents —
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't It be automatic if he

applied for it as a veteran?
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

It would have been under the rule.

It would have been no trouble, would it?

MR. STEINMAN:

He chose not to.

Three of the four

Respondents in this case have filed declarations of intent
to become citizens.

Obviously, at the time the case was

filed, they were not eligible because they had not lived here
the requisitenumber of years.
The Postal Service has now changed its regulations
now that it is no longer under the umbrella of the Civil
Service Commission.

It now allows non-citizens to apply on

the same basis for almost all positions in the Postal Service.
I submit that, to respond to Mr. Bork's argument that it
might be administratively impossible or inconvenient to do
so.

The Postal Service has more than one-half million
employees and yet it had chosen, last May, to change its
regulations to now allow non-citizens to apply for and hold
most jobs.
As far as the Equal Protection Clause, clearly,

26
this Court has recognized that the Bill of Rights, although
not explicitly containing Equal Protection statements, con­
tains Equal Protection principles.
This Court said, on the same day that it issued the
decision in Brown versus Board of Education, it would be
unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser
duty on the Federal Government than it imposes on the states.
This Court has continued to make sure that such an
unthinkable anomaly does not occur and throughout the last
two decades has applied the same type of standards and the
same type of approaches in regard to federal discrimination
that would have applied had the discrimination been practiced
by the states.
Last term, Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for this
Court said,

"In Johnson versus Robison, if a classification

would be invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
Amendment, it is also inconsistent with the Due Process
requirement of the Fifth Amendment."
Mr. Bork, however, contends that the Equal Pro­
tection Clause does not apply because this case involves the
Federal Government classifying aliens on the basis of their
alienage.
Unfortunately, such a statement ignores the clear'
holdings of this Court in the last four years that classi­
fications based on alienage are enherently suspect, not just

27
sometimes suspect, tut inherently suspect, that, "Aliens
as a class are a prime example of a di3creet and insular
minority for whom heightened judicial solicitude is
appropriate."
I think it is important to emphasize why this
Court reached that conclusion.
This Court has described the indicia that are
common to all the classes which are deemed suspect.
Rodriquez case, this Court said that

In the

such heightened jud­

icial solicitude was needed because these individuals are,
"Saddled with such disabilities or subjected to such a
history of purposeful

inequal treatment or relegated to

such a position of political powerlessness as to command
extraordinary protection from majoritarian political
process."
Mr. Justice Powell, in the Griffiths case,
delineated some of the historic hostility that has been
heaped upon non-citizens, the scorn.

They have been

treated as constitutional outcasts.
This Court has recognized that most states today
do not alloi'j non-citizens to vote, that they have been
denied the franchise.

Likewise, the fact that non-citizens

can become citizens if they wish to exercise the option
given to them by Congress did not dissuade this Court in
other cases.

28
In Sugarman3 two of the four Appellees chose not
to exercise the right to become a citizen.
Mr. Justice Powell in Griffiths explicitly stated
that Mrs. Griffiths chose not to file a declaration of Intent.
Even in Graham versus Richardson the Appel3.ee
Richardson had been in this country far longer than necessary
to become a citizen., yet the fact that she chose not to
become a citizen also was of no import to this

Court.

What I am saying is that the classification based
on alienage does not change because it is the Federal
Government.
This Court has continued to recognize that when the
Federal Government itself practices discrimination it is
bound by the same standards and the same protections which
have been put on the states in similar discrimination.
In the Griffiths case, Mr. Justice Powell said
that the interest has been characterized, what the government
must shows in many ways, overriding, compelling, important,

v

I am not worried about pigeon-holing this case under
anyone — I mean, under any of those words.

As the Court

said, we attribute no particular significance to these
variations in* diction.
What is important is when such discrimination
exists, the government has a duty to show something more than

29

just some rational basis although, as we contend, even
under that more deferential standard that the Ninth Circuit
found in this case., the government has not satisfied its
duty.
Now, I’d just like to make one remark in that
area.

The test is whether or not the government has employed

means which rationally relate to some governmental purpose.
There is only one purpose in this case. "The
purpose is to best promote the efficiency of the Civil
Service."
That is a direct quote from 5 U.S.C. 3301.
The purpose of the Civil Service System is to
overcome the spoils which historically, unfortunately,
attach to government employment.
The purpose of the Government Civil Service system
is not to hire citizens.

The Court has long discarded the

old notion of a special public interest.
The purpose is to have an efficient government
and there is nothing about being a non-citizen — about
being a resident alien which means that a person will not
be efficient, will not be a competent employee.
Unfortunately, my client and other resident aliens
throughout the country are not even given the right to apply,
are not even given the right to go through the normal
investigative screening processes which show what individual

30

is efficient for the job, to show whether the individual may
be loyal.

I do not deny that sometimes a person, because of

his non-citizen status, may net be loyal.
This government spends millions of dollars each
year and employs tens of thousands of people to cheek on the
loyalty of citizens for certain positions.
My clients want to be treated equally in that sense
QUESTION;

Will your clients be willing to take the

oath to support the Constitution of the United States and
"defend it?
"

MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

One of them did.

MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Three of them have.

I say, one of them certainly did.

MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

To the extent —

Three of them have —

So there Is no objection on their part

to that.
MR. STEINMAN:

No.

The fourth ha3 not, for her own

purpose or her own religious reasons, her own political
reasons and I don’t think that she would sign it.
The Congress does not require — in the past, until
1952, Congress required that resident aliens coming into this
country sign a declaration of intent to become a citizen.
The 1952 laws erased that requirement so the Congi’ess itself
does not do it.

31
I would think that probably a large percentage of
resident aliens would be willing to sign that oath but
unfortunately the regulation and its Interpretation by the
Civil Service Commission preclude that possibility.
QUESTION:

Could you expand on your comment that

your one client refused for her own religious and political
reasons?

Tell us what that means.
MR. STEINMAN:

When I say refused., she has not

chosen the option which Congress has given her.

It is not

in the record so I am going out of the record but what she
has told me is that she feels that she is a citizen of the
world and that she doesn't feel that she owes any more or
less loyalty to any country.
She chooses — she was — her name is Miss bum.
She was sought by HEW to be an evaluator of education
programs.

She has 15 years of teaching experience.

She

has one Master’s Degree and has studied at many universities
including Stanford and Seton Hall.
They asked her to apply.

She couldn’t.

I asked her why don’t you become a citizen?

Her point

She said

initially she didn’t for political reasons because it might
have harmed her family in China.
Over the years she has said that she likes her
status of being a citizen of the world.
Congresss until 1952 required --

32
QUESTION:

Well, she is a citizen of the world

but of what nation, in fact, is she a citizen?
MR. STEINMAN:

I don’t think that — I think that

she feels that she Is a resident of the United States but In
our conversation she has not stated that she was a citizen
of any one country.
QUESTION:

Where was she born?

In China?

Mainland

China?
MR. STEINMAN:

Yes.

The other three named Respondents have filed
declarations of intent to become citizens although, as I said,
the Congress no longer requires it.
Counsel for the Government has said there are —
even if'you apply, as he assumes, the more deferential test,
he said that it is satisfied by various interests to induce
people to become citizens.
Well, I would assume also that lire can induce people
to become citizens by now allowing them to work for state
governments.

Such a factor was raised before this Court

and obviously not found dispositive.
Also, the notion of administrative burdens.

I

would submit that administrative burdens are both legally and
factually irrelevant.
This Court has very strongly said that the
Constitution requires higher values in speed and efficiency.

33
that, quote — this is from the

Frontlero case decided in

1973 -- ’’There can be no doubt that administrative conveninece is not a shibboleth,

he mere recitation of which

dictates constitutionality.”
I would also point this Court to page 28 of our
brief, a long quote from Mr. Justice Black in Reid versus
Covert where he said that ”To allow an argument of admin­
istrative convenience is a very dangerous doctrine and if
allowed to flourish, would destroy the basis of a written
Consticufcion and undermine the basis of our government.”
I also submit that administrative inconvenience
is factually irrelevant.

Although there are millions of

jobs in the Federal Civil Service, very few involve the
type of policy-making issues, involve the type of responsibilities which this Court recognized in Sugarman might
best be reserved to citisens.
I also submit that the fact that the U. S. Postal
Service, which employs more than a half million people
itseli has found that it could change its regulations is
another example that administrative inconvenience, even if
legally relevant, which we do not agree —
QUESTION:

Well, aren’t we talking about

constitutional power here?

If the government wanted to, in

any particular department, assuming that Mr. Bork, the
Solicitor General’s position is entirely correct, they can

mr.

STEINMAN:

That is right, but they have chosen

Now what about your argument on

ship so that the very denial of citizenship

benefits until

they take some steps which a native-born American need not
take is a form of discrimination., is it not?
MR. STEINMAN:

Yes.

I think the answer, though,

stems — well, the problem which you have raised stems from
the confusion.

The plenary power of the United States
A.

Government is not over aliens.

Last — in Sugarman, at

page 646, this Court said, "Its comprehensive power over
immigration and naturalization," and to the extent that
decisions are made concerning who enters this country, the
conditions of naturalization, who is deported, that is to
what the plenary power addresses itself.
But as this Court stated in 1970 — and 1 quote,
it is at page 39 of the brief, the case is Hellenic Lines
versus Rhoditis, this is a quote:

"The Bill of Rights is a

futile authority for the aliens seeking admission for the
first time to these shores but once an alien lawfully enters
and resides in this country, he becomes invested with the
v*-.-

35
rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within
border.," and I’ll skip a few sentences and go on to the
last.
"The Constitution extends the inalienable privi­
leges to all persons and guards against any encroachment on
those rights by federal or state authority."
The plenary power argument —
QUESTION:

What kind of a case was that?

MR. STEINMAN:

This was a case concerning benefits

under the Jones Act for Seamen but the argument was made
that because the person was only a lawfully resident alien,
he was not entitled to certain of the benefits.
QUESTION:

What do you have to say about the

Solicitor General’s point that Congress would have plenary
power to attach conditions to the original entry?
MR. STEINMAN:
correct.

I would think that is probably

I would think — I would also make this Court

aware that Congress, in 1965, by statute, took away any
powers that it might have — though it need not do so — to
discriminate against incoming aliens on the basis of race,
creed or religion and according to my research and
according to the Handbook on Immigration Law by Mr. Gordon
and Mr. Rosenfield, there are currently only two laws on the
books which condition — put any conditions on aliens
entering.

36
One is a bond for those who might become dependent
on the welfare system.

The other rela-es to aliens who might

otherwise be inadmissible.
I agree with you that under the decisions of

this

Court — although I personally might not like that — Congress
can attach any conditions It wishes on those who have not yet
entered the country.
One of the key factors is whether or not someone
is lawfully here.
QUESTION:

Including excluding them entirely.

MR. STEINMAN:

I would think so and I would also

'"think that Congress could even say that you enter the country
on the condition you can’t work for the state or federal —
for the state government.
The issue in this case involves people who are
lawfully here.
QUESTION:

To the extent, Mr. Steinman, you say

Congress has plenary power over conditions of naturalization,
to the extent your argument were followed here I take it
Congress would not have a great deal to do in that area if
there is very little it can do to distinguish between people
who are naturalized and people who are simply resident aliens
and haven’t started naturalization.
MR. STEINMAN:

I think there are many distinctions

between naturalized and native-born citizens and resident

37
aliens.
First of all, obviously, decisions concerning
immigration and deportation could only be made in regards to
resident aliems.

Citizens are not covered by that.

Second of all, although, as this Court recognized,
the Constitution applies to both citizens and non-citizens,
there Is a difference in how the Constitution applies.
If you are an alien, the government, as it is
trying to do in this case, can suggest possible compelling
or overriding interests why an alien can be discriminated
against.
If you are a citizen, there is no Interest that
would allow the government to discriminate against you on
your status as a citizen.
Because you are a citizen, you cannot be denied
the right to vote, the right to employment.

You may be

denied it for other reasons.
Because you are an alien, you may, under the
Constitution, be denied those rights if the government can
show a compelling interest.
QUESTION:

Well, has this Court ever found that

the government was able to show a compelling interest where
the compelling interest test was applied?
MR. STEINMAN:

I am not aware of that but I would

think that in the Sugarman case, you explicitly suggest that

38
in the area of voting, in the area of holding high public
office, in the area of holding positions of public policy
and confidential components, that the government might be
able to satisfy — the state government might be able

to

satisfy the compelling interest test.
QUESTION:

In other words, the Justice is really

asking whether the choice of the test doesn't dictate the
result?
MR. STEINMAN:

I think in this case it doesn't

because T think that the Respondents prevail under either
test.
To the extent that the choice of the test dictates
the result, that is because the Constitution is very zealous
to make sure that members of suspect classes have heightened
judicial' protection.
The problem in this case, of course, is not whether
or not the Federal Government can, for certain jobs, require
citizenship.

We don’t object to that.

We think it can.

The problem here is the blanket exclusion and
obviously, the vice of overbreadth Is very serious.
QUESTION:

You say the government or the Congress

could impose conditions on entry, including a condition that
you wouldn't work for state government.
I take it you suggest it just hasn't exercised
that power here?

39
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

But if It had — if it had, you wouldn’t

be here.
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I am not sure I wouldn’t be

here, but I think the test would be quite different and I
think this Court would give more deference to the Congres­
sional power.
As our brief suggests, we don't think that, even
if plenary power exists, that it Is something Which auto­
matically means the government wins.
QUESTION:

Well —

MR. STEINMAN:

In this context, the Court has

said that you cannot invoke plenary power as "A talismanic
incantation to support the exercise of any Congressional
power."
But clearly, if we are in the area of the plenary
power in regard to decisions concerning the immigration or
deportation, I would think that the government would have a
much easier burden to satisfy.
QUESTION:

How do you categorize the federal

power to exc3.ude or to deport an alien If he commits a crime?
MR. STEINMAN:

That is under the plenary power

under the Constitution 'which gives Congress — the Consti­
tution only says plenary power regarding naturalisation.
This Court has said that implicitly contains

plenary power over decisions in regard to immigration and
deportation.

That is where the plenary power is.

The

plenary power is not totally over aliens.
QUESTION:

So you would say that — you

would say

that if a — if the government can deport a person for
committing a crime the -government could, if it said so
clearly, deport him for trying to work for the government or
for working for the government.
MR. STEINMAN:

This Court has —

over the last two

decades — carved out some substantive procedure, some
substantive due process protections for those being deported.
I am noc sure that the example you give would
satisfy the Court’s protection.
QUESTION:

But this is a fairly big difference, for

example, between a citizen and an alien.
MR. STEINMAN:

I totally agree and, fortunately,

this case does not involve resident aliens who are doing
something wrong, but involves resident aliens who wish to
work for the government and use the skills that they brought
with them in the best ways.
QUESTION:

So you think this case really — really

involves —- from one point of view, only an argument over
whether the Congress has exercised powers that it obviously
has?
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I think that Congress exercises

power.

I don't think that it has exercised powers in the

area of plenary powers which this Court has carved out.
I think that one way to think of the plenary
powers argument i3 that when this Court has focused on
issues of immigration and deportation, it is because they
involve issues of national security.
foreign affairs.

They involve issues of

They involve issues of the sovereignty of

this country and when those type issues are intertwined, it
becomes more important for this Court to recognize Congress’
power as given by the Constitution.
Applying for

federal employment as a janitor or

applying for federal employment as a file clerk raises no
issue of national security.

It raises no issue of foreign

affairs and I think that is the distinction which has to be
made.

*'
QUESTION:

Well, what kind of employment did your

fourth client apply for, the one who is the citizen of the
world?
MR. STEINMAN:

She was —- she sought, HEW asked her

if she was interested in being an evaluator of education
programs and on their request, she sought to file an
application and was not permitted to file an application.
And should it turn out, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that
the position that she sought might involve issues of national
security, might involve the type of executive policy-making

42
which was of

concern to this Court in the end of the

Sugarman decision and quite properly, she might he foreclosed
from that position.
The problem is that the regulation as it reads now
does not permit that decision to even be made.

It cuts her

off at the start before anyone can inquire into her qualaf: cations or ability.
QUESTION:

This regulation is common to most of

the nations in the world, isn’t it?
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I suppose your point is that they don't

have the Constitution of the United States and they can
indulge in all the xenophobia they want to.
MR. STEINMAN:

"Well,' this Court has said repeatedly

the Reid case, Mr. Justice Black said the United States is
entirely a creature of the Constitution and its power and
authority have no other source.
My one observation, I think, is important, that we
had we looked to international law, this Court would have
decided the Sugarman and Griffiths cases totally the other
way because international law does not permit non-citizens
to work in the states of various countries.
QUESTION:

Well, most c§untries are not federal

systems such as ours„
MR. STEINMAN:

But those that are would not reach

43
decisions that this Court reached In Sugarman.
Likewise, the government has properly said that
this type of regulation has been on the books for nearly
100 years.
Well, clearly, as this Court has said, no one
requires a vested or protected right

in violating tne

Constitution.
Mr. Justice Burger, in 1970, in the Williams
versus Illinois case, I think said it best:

"New cases

expose old infirmities xvhich apathy or absence of challenge
have permitted to stand but the constitutional imperatae
of the Equal Protection Clause must have priority over the
comfortable convenience of the status quo."
We feel very strongly that the Ninth Circuit was
entirely correct in striking down this regulation as being
unconstitutional.

We also feel strongly, as our brief

indicates, that the Ninth Circuit could have avoided the
constitutional issue by finding that this regulation was
not authorized by either the United States Congress or by
the President of the United States.
This Court has required, when sensitive individual
rights are involved, that there be explicit authorizations
when the Executive Brandi issues a regulation, that the
substantial restraints and employment opportunities which
raise issues of constitutional dimension require explicit

and specific authorization.
This is from Greene versus MoElroy.
In this situations there is no Congressional
authorization.

The statutes since 1883 are totally silent on
They are specifics though, about a myriad of

other employment criteria.

They authorize the President to

ascertain the fitness as to age, health, character, knowledge,
ability for employment sought.
The specificity with regard to these five criteria,
I ttfould submit, indicate that other criteria were not
Intended and, given the fact that the whole operation of the
Civil Service program is to best promote the efficiency of
the Civil Service, it can best be promoted by a larger pool
of employees, not a smaller pool.
QUESTION:

Well, the government has solved that

problem by picking and choosing which aliens it wants in the
past, has it not?
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Not under the —

It doesn’t deny itself the pool.

It

■ 'M?

when they have a great need for the particular services.
MR. STEINMAN:

Unfortunately, my clients are not of

the status of Mr. von Braun and my clients fall under the
competitive Civil Service.
The Federal Government has chosen the non-competitive

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there

after lunch.
[Whereupon, a recess was
12:00 o’clock noon to

1:03 o’clock p.m. 3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Steinman, you have

a few minutes left.
MR. STEINMAN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it Please the
Court:
My remarks ended concerning our arguments that the
regulation is not authorized by the Congress or the President
and that the regulation also conflicts with two

Executive

Orders.
I feel that our presentation in the brief ade­
quately covers that.
I'd like to conclude by remarking that under the
Constitution of the United States, the Congress has many
alternatives, many paths it can take.

It can, as suggested

by this Court’s decision in Sugarman, issue regulations,
statutes which say that particular positions, because of
issues of sensitivity, because of issues of national security,
because they involve the formulation, the execution, the
review of broad public policy, may only rest with non­
citizens or may only rest with citizens.

46
Likewise» it was suggested this morning, Congress»
if it chooses — and it has not so chosen yet — can impose
certain conditions on those vjho enter» those who have not yet
achieved the status of lawful resident aliens» those who
have still not touched upon this soil or the country.
The point is that Congress has not chosen to do
4’that.
QUESTION:

I need to make — to get that clear.

Does a condition that Congress might impose, does
it end when they finally admit him to the country?
MR. STEINMAN:

According to the decisions of this

Court, the importance that attaches when a person becomes a
lawful resident alien that has entered this country as a
resident alien to be here on a permanent basis, that is when
the person’s rights under the Constitution as a person comes
into effect.
QUESTION:

Weil, you suggest then that if you admit

a person to this country for permanent residence or even for
temporary residence, that the condition — you cannot impose
a condition that while he is here he not work for the
Federal Government.
MR. STEINMAN:

No, I am suggesting that once he is

here that condition not be imposed.

If that is imposed as a

condition of his entry into the United States ~
QUESTION:

I see.

47
MR. STEINMAN:

— that is an entirely different

matter.
QUESTION;

And you say that has not been done

here?
MR. STEINMAN:

That has not been done here, no, it

has not and as I have suggested, the Congress has only in
two different areas Imposed conditions on those who enter
the United
’

States.
This is not this case here.
QUESTION:

Well, if that condition were imposed

upon his entry and he violated the conditions, what is the
governments sanction?
MR. STEINMAN:

The government obviously can

potentially — if that is one of the grounds for deportation,
impose
the government has chosen first not to compose the condition
and second of all, the government has not utilized depor­
tation for violation of certain types of laws but the
government would always have the powers of deportation
subject to, of course, constitutional constraints that are
placed on that.
QUESTION:

And It could disqualify the alien from

working for the government.
MR, STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, then, aren't you really -- if you

prevail here, aren't you really opening the door to just

this kind of action by Congress and, if it is taken, are not
your clients worse off than they are today?
’

MR. STEINMAN:

Clearly.

My clients wouldn’t be

because they are resident aliens but, possibly, xuture
immigrants to this country might have conditions imposed on
them.
My point is that, for purposes of argument in
this case I will concede that Congress has it.

As an

attorney, if that case came before me, I would like to be
back before this Court and argue the point.
QUESTION:

You’d say that wasn’t a constitutional

condition.
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

I would say that.

Sure.

MR, STEINMAN:

But I am trying to say that at this

point, Congress — the vehicle that Congress has chosen, now,
a blanket regulation that only deals with resident aliens,
is not a proper vehicle under the Constitution.
In Graham, this Court said, "The Congress does not
have the power to authorize the individual states to violate
the Equal Protection Clause.”
What I am suggesting in this case is that Congress
doesn’t itself have the power to authorize itself to violate
the Fifth Amendment.
Whatever test this Court employs, the compelling

49

interest test, the rational relation, et cetera, the
Congress has

violated the Constitution.

Should Congress choose other vehicles — and I
would hope the Congress would take the lead that Mr. Justice
Blackmun suggested in Sugarman that possibly identify those
types of positions where maybe we'd wish to have citizen
formulation» execution and review of broad public policies,
that Congress take the lead of the Postal Service where the
Postal Service has identified that certain sensitivepositions still must be held only by citizens.
But that for the broad mass of people such as the
jobs that my clients are seeking — unfortunately not seeking
the jobs held by Mr. von Braun •— that citizenship is
clearly not relevant to that.
Than’- you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Stelnman.

Mr. Solicitor General, do you have anything
further?
MR. BORK:

I have nothing further, Mr. Chief

Justice.
