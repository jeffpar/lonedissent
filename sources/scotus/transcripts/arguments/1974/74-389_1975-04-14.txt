ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS V„ LOWDEN, JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER ALBEMARLE' PAPER COMPANY
MR0 LOWDENt

Thank you, sir»

There are two broad issues before the Courts
testing and back paya
Case 74-389 involves the employer petitioners, who
I®11 refer to throughout my argument as Albemarle»

That case

raises ail of the issues»
Case 74-428 .involves the union petitioner, anc3 the
issue there is primarily back pay»
Therefore, we have divided the argument, and it is
our intention, if it pleases the Court, to — for me to argue
for fifteen minutes on the bads: pay — on the testing issues,
and then rely on Mr» V7oods, who represents the union, to
make our argument, on back pay»
And we would hope to save tan minutes for rebuttal,
particularly because we received a brief on Thursday from the
Solicitor General,
wesd like to have a

n 5 we understand he*s going to argue, and
time fee rebut, after he gets through»

4
The one thing that seems to be agreed by everyone is
that personnel tests are useful,
deviceo

invaluable employee selection

The Congress has said 30, I believe this Court has?

even the guidelines of the EEOC admit that#
After that one thing? we part. company.
I think the real question before the Cotirt on the
business of testing is whether, as a practical matter? the way
the lax* has developed, these tests can be used at all»
Before getting to the heart of that, however, let me
say a word about the theory of how tests discriminate,
There is some evidence that disadvantaged people do
less well on tests than do educated people.

Sc the theory is

that if a test screens out propojrtionately more of a
particular ethnic group ■*»«* in this case we're dealing with
blacks —» and they are otherwise qualified, it is an unfair
test.
The key, I think, is the proviso?

if they are

otherwise qualified.
So, really, when yon talk about statistics in these
cases, you are talking about a universe of people who are
otherwise qualified to do the job you have.

Furthermore,

at our mill in Roanoke Rapids, we are going to employ and
primarily employ people from the Roanoke Rapids area.

In the

paper industry, workers do not go from mill to mill, they are
quite far apart, and there is no interchange.

So if you limit the universe to those people in the
Roanoke Rapids area who are otherwise qualified, that is the.
significant statistics in our judgments
And things like national statistics# we think are
irrelevant.
Now# as we read the Griggs case# it holds that# on
the issue of discriminatory testing# the burden is on the
plaintiffs to show that the test they're talking about has a
disparate effect on their particular group.
No such showing was ever made in this case.

In

fact# I would go so far# I think I can fairly say# no effort,
was made to show that before the district judge.
Now# on appeal in the Fourth Circuit# the issue
came up for -the first time in appellant's brief, I really
believe it was in the amicus brief# where they tried to show#
through some statistics that came up for the first time#
that our test did exclude more blacks proportionately than it
did whites.
From an exhibit in the case# which was merely
introduced and which we always contended was not entirely
reliable# they extracted the following statistics:

that

the blacks who took Albemarle's test# the Revised Beta Test#
averaged 104.205 and we required# for certain employment in
certain lines of progression#tliat they get 100.
On the two Wonderlie Tests s

Wonderlie A was re~

6

quired, and Wonderlie B, if you take if you didn't pass Wonderlie
Act, our cutoff score was 18,

The blacks averaged 17 on that

test.
At the re commendation of our export who testified in
this case, recommended, that that be reduced to 17? so, since
1971, 17 has been the cutoff on the Wonderlie A.
V

We say that these statistics do not deal with the
proper statistical universe.

They are subject to some doubt

as to their accuracy, and they were introduced in the Fourth
Circuit for the first tine.
We believe that there x<ras no substantial showing in
this case that our tests screened out a disproportionate number
of black people.
Furthermore, if the universe were limited to
qualified employees, there is no evidence in this record that
any black employee was ever denied a job for which he was
qualified, not a single instance.
Gentlemen, if you would look at page 9 of our blue
brief and notice the little diagram in there, "3 Paper Mill
Department", then on the left a line of progression called
"Paper Machine", I think 1 can explain to you why this issue
is so important to my client and we think to many other
employers throughout the country.
We have in our mill at
QUESTION;

—

Is it the brief or the petition?

7
MR. LOWDENs
QUESTION?

This blue brief, sir,
Is it the brief or the petition for

cert?
MR, LOWDEN:

It is the brief of the employer

petitioner,,
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. LOWDEN:

These two paper machines, modern

machines at our mill, are about, nearly twice as long as a
football field*
QUESTION:

Now we’re looking at the one at the

top, are we, Mr. Lowden?
MR. LOWDEN:
QUESTION:
MR. LOWDEN:
QUESTION:
MR, LOWDEN:
feet per minute.

The paper machine —
Yes, thank you,
Paper machine.
Yes.
These machines run at about 2,000

That’s how fast the paper is coming through.

Wo turn out a thousand tons a day? and these machines would
cost today thirty or more millions of dollars to replace,
just the machine.
I think the briefs now admit that the paper machine
line of progression is what is called a functionally related
line of progression.
That means that as you laarn the bottom jobs,
Spare Hand No. 4, you learn at the same time the skills and

8

gain the knowledge and experience necessary for Seventh Hand»
And then you progress up that ladder, by seniority, and in each
case, when you*re Seventh Hand you're learning how to be a
Sixth, and so forth; until you finally get to the top job in
our mill, which is the Machine Tender»
QUESTION:

Are there fewer in number in each classifi­

cation, as you go upward?
MR. LOWDEN:

No, sir.

The mill works 24 hours a

day, seven days a week, 362 days a year; the shifts rotate,
so you have four shifts; so you have four men in each one of
those jobs on each of -the two paper machines.
QUESTION:

So there*s as many Machine Tenders on

each shift as they are Spare Hands No. 4?
MR. LOWDEN:

Yes, sir.

There’s one Machine Tender

on each shift, on each machine.
QUESTION: And one Sparc Hand No. 4?
MR. LOWDEN:

Yes, sir.

One Seventh Hand.

Spare

Hand is only used on one of the machines.
QUESTION:

So each one of these jobs is

a single

person fills it, and the whole ladder makes up the team on
each machine?
MR. LOWDEN:

‘Yes, sir.

For instance, when it’s running smoothly, the machine
tender is up at what they call the wet end of the machine, and
he controls the speed of the machine, what kind of paper,

9

what the strength of the pater is going to be, and so forth.
The back tender works at the back of the machine, and
he has electronic control that he can adjust if it gets a
crease in it, and so forth,
QUESTION s
MR. LOUDEN;

Unh-hunh.
Then the other parts of the crew run

'the winders, sweep the floors, and so forth.
But the critical thing is that if something goes
wrong with the paper and you have a break, and all this wet
stuff is just flying around, then they work like a team,
everybody cooperates, they run down to the machine and do
various tasks, and get that machine back running.
We figured out *— and this is not in the record,
but it's a mathematical thing ~~ if you figure out that a ton
of paper is worth $360, and you have a bunch of paper breaks
on your machine, and you don't repair them quickly, you're
going to lose millions of dollars over the course of a year.
It’s just simple arithmetic.
So that the great emphasis here is on knowledge,
it's on intelligence, what to do, and learn, and how to make
this tremendous high-speed operation really perform efficiently,
productivity* And you must be on the ball, so you don't get
hurt.

It's just — a quick look at it, I think would

convince anyone that the people in there have to be intelligent
people.

10
Now, here's our problems

You cannot, go into the labor

market in Roanoke Rapids and employ a machine tender.
the only ones that have them*

We're

And so forth down the line.

It’s possible to go a hundred miles! away, perhaps, and hire
one from some other mill, but the people in this business do
not interchange between .mills, they lose their benefits and so
forth? and it's vary difficult, and it doesn't happen at all
that you employ

experienced people.

So our problem is that when we hire a new employee,
he's going to start down there at the bottom, and learn, and
probably what he will do when he first comes there will be a
very menial task.

But when we hire these people, we've got to

have people who will go on up that line eventually, when we
need them; are going to be trained, and know hew to run a paper
machine.
And so we think the record here supports us fully.
When these big machines were put in in the 1950's, w® found
that the people that we were employing just couldn't do the
job.

They would go halfway up the line and reach their level

of competence, I believe is the word thex*e; so they tried to
devise some kind of way to predict that a man that they hired,
at a 17, would be able to learn those jobs.
And the personnel man that we had at the time was a.
professional,

almost a Ph.D., in industrial psychology, and

he studied the matter and came up with the Revised Beta Test,

11
and got a correlation and they put that in.
But we think that it's an absolute necessary to our
operation, not only in that line but in the others, that the
people who get employed at the bottom have the ability, or
apparently have the ability, to go to that top job. Because
that's the only place we're going to get people to take that
job and run our mill efficiently.
I saw that red light come on — is it supposed to
be on?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Have you given him the

signal?
THE TIMEKEEPER;
MR. LQWDEN;
the argument

Yes, sir.

Well, I really haven't gotten down to

but I best better let Mr. Woods take up the

other subject.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Woods.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN WOODS, ESQ.,
ON BEHAI,F OF PETITIONER HALIFAX LOCAL 425, ETC.
MR. WOODS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
j\s counsel for the union petitioner in this case,
in our view, the question presented is a very narrow one.
It is paraphrasing somewhat the question presented
in our petition for certiorari:

Whether a Court of Appeals

has the power, in a Title VII private action, to order the

12
trial judge to award back pay as a matter of course whenever
unlawful employment practices are enjoined, absent rarely
encountered special circumstances, despite the congressional
intendment in Section 706(g) of the Act, that the district
court in its discretion may order ~~ may order ~ such
affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include
reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay»
At the outset, we remind the Court that the AFL-CIO,
with which this local union is affiliated, actively supported
and lobbied for the Civil Rights Act of 1364 and its later
amendment in 1972.
Indeed, the AFL-CIO has been in the forefront of the
right to bring equal employment opportunities to all workers
regardless of race, color, sex, religion or national origin,
or, for that matter, age.
We do not,under this statement of the question in
this case, question the propriety of back pay relief in an
appropriate case.

Indeed, in many cases where unions have been

plaintiffs in Title VII actions, we have aggressively sought
such relief at the trial court lave! and have often succeeded
in obtaining it.
But, despite our approval of the philosophy, the
policy, and the general structure of the Act, we believe, as
this Court has often recognised in decisions relating to
controversial new legislation, that type of legislation is the

13
product of give"*and--take between opposing groups in Congress,
and compromise produces particular forms of language,
including 706(g),,

The language represents the political

judgment of people in Congress, and we believe, under the
separation of powers doctrine, this Court, where that judgment
is expressed clearly, must give effect to it.
In the mandatory version, the original version of
706(g) as it developed in the House, would have made the
granting of affirmative relief upon a finding of a violation
of the Act mandatory.

The actual version, which came from

the Senate side, which was adopted as the present 706(g),
and that uses the permissive and discretionary language which
I mentioned in my statement of the issue.
Now, it is our position in this case that a Court
of Appeals may not substitute a mandatory back pay rule
whenever injunctive relief is granted, for the discretionary
rule embodying traditional equity principles, which 706(g)
sets forth; in short, it may not intrude on the legislative
sphere by divesting the district court of the traditional
equity jurisdiction vested in it by Congress; and, in effect,
we write the legislation.
Not, I think it would be helpful here .if we review
precisely what the district court did in this case.
At trial, it had four issues before it, as Mr.
Lowden has stated, only two of those issues, or three of them

14
really need concern us here now.
The first issue was whether the seniority system then
in effect, as a result of collective bargaining between the
union and the company, operated to continue into the present
the effects of past discrimination.
The second issue was whether the testing system was
unfair to blacks.
The third issue was whether back pay was an appropri­
ate remedy under all the circumstances of the case.
Now, looking first at the seniority system, the
court noted that prior to the affective date of the Act there
had been a segregation of jobs as between blacks and whites,
and that blacks had been relegated largely to the lower paying
jobs o
It then noted,however, that in 1964 the employer and
the union had established a maintenance apprenticeship program,
which concentrated on the recruitment and training of Negro
applicants for that program, and that the maintenance jobs were
high-paid jobs, and that blacks had moved into that program
and some had succeeded in reaching apprenticeship jobs and
higher jobs.
It noted also that the parties to the collective
bargaining agreement, the employer and the union, had early on
opened up all lines of progression to transfers from other lines
of progression

15
And it noted specifically that in 1968

and this

came after the first Quarles vs, Phillip Morris decree and
die Local 189, Crown Zellerbaah decree in the Fifth Circuit»
In ’68 they had merged separate extra boards into
one, which fed all lines of progression,,

They had agreed to

permit transfers between lines of progression on the basis
of mill seniority, instead of job seniority, or instead of
on an arbitrary acceptance of transfers, as the company might
deem proper*
They also agreed to allow a transferee from one line
of progression into another, to carry with him into his new
line of progression his previously acquired departmental and
job seniority, which, as was testified at the hearing, was
usually tantamount to plant seniority.
And they had also granted, in order to encourage
blacks to transfer from lower paying lines of progression
into higher paying lines of progression, they granted a red
circle rate protection arrangement so that the black trans­
ferring into a new line of progression at an entry level
job would continue to receive the higher rate he had in a
preceding line of progression until he reached the level of
pay in his new line»
This was all done in 1968»
Nevertheless, the court concluded that there was
still left some vestige of the job seniority system in this

picture, and that there was not sufficient posting of jobs to
make people aware of when they were available, and it concluded,
therefore, that, there should be an injunction decree issued
directing certain affirmative action similar to that which had
been issued in the Quarles and Crown-Zelierbach cases.

And he

did so.
The second issue dealing with the testing procedures,
we pause only briefly to say Mr, Lowden has argued it, the
union has taken no part in the litigation of that issue or in
its briefing.

We acknowledge, however, that in complex opera­

tions, such as paper mills, — and I have represented the
International Union in this field for some 25 or 30 years —
there is some, in our view, business necessity for a form of
testing as long as it meets the guidelines and accurately
predicts ability to perform the job.
On the crucial issue of back pay in this case, however,
the judge refused to award it.

He noted, first, that under

706ig) ha had a broad discretion to order affirmative action
with or without back pay.
He refused to order back pay because of the goodfaith corrective steps which the parties had taken without
delay to keep up with the expanding state of the law.

And

because plaintiffs had early in -the case disavowed any back
pay claims on a class basis, and had changed their minds nearly
five years after the institution of this action.

17
This was one of the first cases brought under Title
VII of the Civil nights Act of 1964.

Charges were filed with

the EEOC in May of 1966, and this action was brought without
benefit of any determination from the EEQCin August of 1966.
He also mentioned, in explaining his refusal to grant
back pay, -the business necessity in this industry for demanding
a high degree of training and skills in the operation of
complex machinery and the payment of wages generally higher
than other industries in the area.
And he then left the attorney’s fees issue to later
determination, if the parties could not agree on an amount.
Now, there had been an opportunity at trial to
present specific evidence on qualifications and individual
claims.

The judge had said that he would try this.

As a

matter of fact, however, only eleven members of a class of
about a hundred people were called as witnesses in person,
and five testified through deposition.
The record shows -- the Appendix shows here that
many of these people were illiterate, had never applied for
higher- paying jobs, and had not even attempted to go to a
school, which the company and the union jointly set up and
operated to try and relieve literacy problems of both white
and black employees of the mill.
Thus, plaintiffs had an opportunity to try the back
pay issue on an individual basis in rejection.

Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina,.

QUESTION:

Oh, that's

so it’s not anywhere close

to Roanoke, Virginia?
MR. WOODS:

Hot near Roanoke, Virginia, Your Honor,

QUESTION: Right,
What part of the State of North Carolina is it?
MR. WOODS:

That is the north central part of North

It's up near the Virginia border»
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. WOODS:

The Court of Appeals reviewed the

actions, the panel, a majority, Judge Craven wrote the opinion
and Judge Bryan, reviewed the record and finally said that,
in their opinion, back pay should be payable in the same manner
as attorney’s fees were payable under Title II in the test that.
Your Honors set forth in the Piggie Park Enterprises ■— Hex-man
vs. Piqcria Park Enterprises case.
In short, Piggie Park said, where there is a violation
of Title II, public accommodations provision of the statute

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Chambers.

Very well, Mr, Woods V

ORAL ARGUMENT OF Ju LeVONNE CHAMBERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CHAMBERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As has been indicated, this case involves or
presents for review basically two issues:

one involving the

company's attempt to validate a test that it has been using
since around 1955? and the other, the standard for review by
a district court in determining whether to award back pay in
a Title VII class action proceeding, where the plaintiffs
have established a clear violation of the Act.
I will address briefly the testing issue, and then
look into the matter of back pay.
Mr. Lowden has suggested that this company requires
some training and preparation for a party to work.
We suggest that the test that was established by
this Court in Griggs v. Duke Power require that whatever
standard of criteria are adopted, if those standards of
criteria adversely affect black employees, that those
standards of criteria cannot be used unless they have been
properly validated.
In Griggs this Court, correctly we submit, adopted
a high standard of proof for companies to demonstate that
test or criteria which adversely affect black employees
properly measure a man for the job rather them a man in the

20
abstract.

Only by following guidelines, such as those this

Court endorsed in Griggs, like the EEOC guidelines, can a court,
on review, properly determine, whether efforts by a company to
validate tests are proper and properly measure a man for tin a
job.
If these standards are not adhered to,

vjq

submit to

the Court that Griggs v. Duke Power will, in effect, be overruled,,
One of the first requirements in a proceeding in­
volving testing is that the plaintiffs show an adverse impact.
We respectfully submit that that is more than abundantly clear
in the record, as we have pointed out in our brief.

We show

statistically an adverse impact on black employees by the tests
us *d by the company.

The district court made specific findings

that the tests adversely affected black employees.
The district court specifically found that blacks
were not in the skilled lines of progression, the lines for
which the tests were required, because they could not meet the
educational and testing requirement.
We respectfully submit that we have more than shown
an adverse impact of the testing battery.

On that shewing, the

burden shifted to the company to establish that the test and
employment criteria properly measured the applicant for the
job or the employee for the job.
We submit that the proof presented by the company

clearly failed to establish any job relatedness.
The company hired a testing expert to validate the
test, after this Court’s decision in Griggs.

This expert

selected not all of the. jobs for which the tests were required,
but, as the Fourth Circuit indicated, six of the lines of
progression were excluded.
Of those jobs that were tested, 80 percent proved
not validated or not correlated to the test and the
evaluation by the supervisors.
The 20 percent of those groups that were tested,
and which the company claims showed some validation, we submit
that the criteria or procedure followed by the company was
clearly inadequate to establish any kind of job relatedness.
As the Fourth Circuit pointed out, the company failed
to do any kind of job analysis, and that was essential in order
for the company to establish any correlation between the test
score and the supervisor’s rating, to shox<? that the tests
ware properly measuring the employee for the job.
As the guidelines require *— and xve submit it’s
essential — -there must be some kind of job analysis and
selection by the company of criteria to be measured in order
that we don’t have, as this Court suggested or prohibited in
Griggs, a test of a person in the abstract.
The Fourth Circuit pointed out that the company had
failed to comply with the guidelines to establish a properly

22
validated test,,
We respectfully submit that that decision is correct
and should be affirmed here.

Since the company has not validated

its test* arid since those tests do adversely affect black
applicants and employees* we submit that the testing program
I

should be enjoined until -the company has established that their
test properly measure the applicant for tire job* and that they
are job related,
QUESTION;

Mr, Chambers, where in these papers* if

you can tell me without talcing any undue inconvenience*
are the Commission’s guidelines?
MR» CHAMBERS;

They are in the Appendix* Volume II

of the Appendix* I think beginning on page 305.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh,

And these were promulgated

before or after this Court's decision in the Griggs case?
MR* CHAMBERS;

Before this Court's decision in

Griggs * sir.
QUESTION;

Before?

MR. CHAMBERS ;

Yes .

They were adopted in 1970»

This Court’s decision

was in 1971,
QUESTION;

'71, yes.

MR. CHAMBERS;

Thank you»

Moving* then* to the. question of back

pay* we submit that in considering the matter of back pay*
that the Court should keep in mind that we’re not dealing with

23

a company and union here which simply used and excluded —
simply used the test battery which excluded blacks from
4

better-paying job positions.
Mr. Woods suggest that the AFL-CIG supported the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.

That might well be.

Rut there

were many locals, like Halifax Local, which did not.
This company and union assigned black employees to
lower paying job positions and then constructed a seniority
system which prohibited them from transferring to better
paying positions.
Despite the changes that were made in 1964 and the
changes that were made in 1968, the district court found,
correctly, that those changes did not permit black employees
to escape the past discriminatory practices of the union and
the company.
The court further found that because of these
practices, black employees were assigned to lower paying
job positions and sustained substantial economic loss.
These are precisely the types of practices that Congress
sought to reach in the enactment of Title VII in 1964,
We submit that the clear purpose of Congress was to
insure,at least in employment opportunities, that employees
could advance as far as their talents and skills would
permit, and that they would not have to bear the financial
losses which might be occasioned by discriminatory employment

'>

fi

practices„
Congress initially placed the primary responsibility
for challenging employment, discrimination for private litigants.
These responsibilities were continued with the 1972 amendments,
even-though ESOC was then given enforcement authority»
The significance of private litigation cannot be
ignored.

As this Court noted in Newman vs, Piggie Park, a

Title II proceeding, involving the standards that should be
followed in determining whether to award back pay.
Private litigants in these proceedings are not
simply seeking to enforce a private right.

These are proceedings,

public in nature, in which the private litigants are seeking to
enforce rights Congress has considered are the highest
priority,
In this sense, the private litigants become a private
attorney general,
Necessarily, the proceedings affect more than the
private litigants, for the plaintiffs in challenging an
employment practice applicable to or directed against an
identifiable class, as hero, black employees,

Class actions

are not only appropriate but are clearly warranted.

And in

order to insure the implementation of congressional purposes
of the Act, including particularly encouraging voluntary
compliance or private litigation, where voluntary efforts are
unsuccessful, and making whole the victims of discrimination,

25

this Court should, as Congress has clearly indicated, gi
broad equitable relief*
This can be done only by fashioning an objective
standard as in Newman, and as the Fourth Circuit has done in
this case, which would provide for injunctive relief and back
pay, unless there are special circumstances which would render
such an award unjust»
This is all that the Fourth Circuit has done below,
and we submit that it should be affirmed here.
In looking at the standard that the Fourth Circuit
has adopted, and which has been adopted now in the several
circuits that are cited in the brief, we call the Court's
attention to decisions in other areas? in one of the 3.eading
cases in the Fair Labor Standards Act —* or involving the
Fair Labor Standards Act, Mr, Justice Harlan set forth the
correct principle, we submit, which should govern a district
court in exercising its equitable discretion

in a Titia VII

proceeding.
That case was Mitchell vs, Robert De Mario Jewelry,
which is cited in the brief.
There, Justice Harlan stated that the standard
which should govern the district court in exercising its
discretion, is one which requires that the district court
exercise the discretion in order to enforce the purposes of
Congress in enacting the statute.

And there Justice Harlan

26

noted that because of what the Court had found as the statutory
purpose by Congress, there was little room for denying,-there,
recovery under the Act.
Here,, in order to carry out the congressional purpose
in Title VII. there is very little discretion to deny recovery
for losses by victims of discrimination.

They're here only by

providing for relief, unless there are special circumstances
will the Court be able to carry out the clear purposes of
Congress in the enactment of Title VII„
Congress has shown — or the legislative history
further shows that this was the clear purpose of Congress,
not only to provide for injunctive relief but to provide for
back pay, where the victims have shown loss as a result of
discrimination *
In the 1972 Amendments, the legislative history there
clearly shows that Congress intended to provide back pay and to
provide class action and class action back pay.

The section-

by-section analysis of the — that Act in 1972, clearly shows
that Congress intended to provide for class action proceeding
and to provide the back pay relief.
The several Circuits which have considered the Act
have held that Congress intended not only injunctive relief,
but back pay as well,
A similar purpose in the construction of a statute,
such as the Court has done below, has also been sustained in

27
other. proceedings 0
We have referred the Court, in the brief, to NLRB
proceedings, where the Court has found a similar necessity
for providing back pay as the Fourth Circuit has noted in tills
proceeding below»
QUESTION;

Well, what most characterizes the Labor

Board decisions is the deference that the Court will give
to the Board itself in working out what might be an adequate
remedy in a particular case? wouldn't that be fair to say?
MR, CHAMBERS;

I would ~~ that's correct, Your

Honor, but still the Court requires that that discretion be
exercised with a view toward enforcing the Act,
QUESTION;

Here, the

if the same attitude that

seems to pretty much pervade the decisions .in the Labor Act
cases were to be reflected in this case, wouldn't there be
more deference given to what the district court did in this
case?
MR. CHAMBERS;

Mot unless — I don't think so,

I

think here that, and in constructing the statute and giving
it meaning, that the Court should look at the purpose of
Congress in the enactment of the statute.

That purpose being,

as several courts have indicated, to provide injunctive relief
and to make the victim whole»
We think that the exercise of discretion by the
district court should be limited in th® sense of requiring

20
that the district court exercise that discretion for the purpose
of carrying out the intent of Congress,,
Here that intent being to make the victim whole, in
addition to providing injunctive relief,
QUESTION: Are there any Letor Board decisions that
say that the Board must, as a general rule, award back pay
and not do so only under special circumstances?
MR, CHAMBERS:

We think that the decision we cite

in Phelps. Dodge Corporation, which has been cited, interestingly,
by all parties, ~~
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR* CHAMBERS:

— clearly holds that while the Board

has discretion, it must exercise that discretion with a view
toward the purpose of Congress in the Act,
QUESTION:

But Congress didn’t say in the Act, You

will award back pay, period.

It certainly, by the language

it used, appeared to allow considerable discretion to the
district court.
MR. CHAMBERS:

Congress did not say that you must

award back pay in language in the Act, but we think that in the
legislative history in 1972 the intent of Congress to make the
victim whole is clear.
The section-by-section analysis from the committee,
which we refer to in the brief, clearly points out that
Congress intended class action proceedings and intended to make

29

the victim whole, and we think here that in reading the
statute that the Court should find that the purpose v;as to
make the victim whole, and this can be done only by awarding
back pay.
We think that the standard adopted by the Fourth
Circuit is necessary for policy reasons,

Without a provision

for back pay, there is no incentive to a company or union
to review its practices and to make changes where appropriate.
Rather, like the petitioners in this proceeding, an employer
and union would simp3.y sit back or make superficial changes
until compelled to do so by the Act,
Similar examples of recalcitrance is found not only
in employment discrimination cases, but in school desegregation
cases as well, and in other civil rights cases which this
Court had had many occasions to consider.
Uniformity in enforcement is promoted by the
standard adopted by the Fourth Circuit,

Indeed, the standard

adopted by this Court in Newman, which is basically the
standard that was adopted by the Fourth Circuit below, has
assured v/idespread compliance with Title II, and virtually
r.c need for further litigation in Title II — in the Titi® II
area.
Contrary to the petitioners’ contention, the
standard does not deprive the district courts of all discre­
tion.

Examples of the discretion which remain are cited by

30

the Fourth Circuit below.
Nor are there any special circumstances in this case
which would render an award of back pay unjust.

The

defendants assert that they have not acted in bad faith, but
have sought to correct their practices as the law evolved.
Good faith, however, is not an issue in this
proceeding.

The black employees who have suffered from the

discriminatory practices of the company have nevertheless
been victimized, even if petitioners' good faith in doing so
were an issue.
Title VII was designed to male® the victims whole, for
it is the result of -the practice rather than the motive or
purpose that Congress sought to remedy.
As the

courts have noted on many occasions, back

pay is not a penalty .imposed as a sanction for moral turpitude,
but is compensation for tangible economic loss resulting from
an unlawful employment practice.
Moreover, the good faith proposed by the petitioners
here would introduce additional means for limiting the.
effectiveness of Title VII and defeating the purposes of
;Congress in its enactment.

Although the petitioners mad© some

changes in 1964 and 1968, the district court, as indicated
previously, noted that these changes did not relieve blacks
from the prior discriminatory practices of the past.
Nothing prevented the petitioners in this proceeding

31
from doing mo.ro prior to trial# to bring their practices into
compliance with Title VII and eliminating all vestiges of past
discrimination.

And clearly# the victims of discrimination,

the class members here, cannot be charged with bad faith,
and their equities far outweigh the equities of the
petitioners, particularly considering the limited resources
of the victims involved in this proceeding,,
The fact that the company paid higher wages than
some other employers in the area does not provide an adequate
basis for denying back pay*

Black employees in the area

still were deprived of earnings solely because of their race,
and are entitled to relief under Title VII»
Nor does the delay in specifically praying for
back pay bar the class from obtaining relief»

Although the

plaintiff did not specifically pray for back pay in the
complaint, and at an early stage in the proceeding indicated
that they were not seeking back pay for the class, the
plaintiffs made their intention to see back pay for the class
clear more, than a year before trial„
The district court# by order more than a year
before trial, indicated that back pay was still in issue»
In addition to setting forth long before trial
comparative earnings of black and white employees, the
plaintiffs, before trial, submitted answer to interrogatories
and supplemented these answers before trial to show the

32
claims for back pay of each individual member of a class.
We submit that there is neither here a basis here
for laches or waiver.

There has been no purposeful delay, and

no prejudice to the defendants, in the request for class back
pay.
Rule 54(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
provide that where a party has established a right to relief,
the court should award such relief even if not specifically
prayed in the complaint, unless there is some showing of
prejudice to the. defendant,
Hera, we submit that there has bean no prejudice to
the defendant, and relief should be awarded as provided under
tiie Fourth Circuit decision,
I yield the rest of my time to the government,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vary well, Mr, Chambers,

Mr. Turner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. TURNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE EQUAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AS AMICI CURIAE
MI-.. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The United States appears as amicus curiae to urge
the Court to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals,
We believe the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted the law,
and its decision is consistent with this Court’s opinion in

33

Griggs f and is otherwise a proper application of the will of
the Congress.
Turning first to the testing issue.

In Griggs,

which is a strikingly parallel case in many respects, in
response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, I believe the
location of this plant is maybe within a hundred miles of the
Griggs plant in North Carolina — the plant involved in Griggs
in North Carolina? same part of the state.
This Court set forth in Griggs the rule of job
relatadness for tests which disproportionately disqualify
black workers.

That such tests should be enjoined unless the

employer demonstrates them to be a proper and valid measure
of the employee’s successful performance of the job.
The Court of Appeals held that the petitioners had
failed to offer convincing proof on this issue? although a
validation study was done, we believe it did not meet the most
basic professional standards of validation, and,oven if it
was accepted, it did not demonstrate that the tests were
related to the jobs for which the tests were given.
In short, it’s just net the kind of assurance, in
our view, that this Court was seeking in Griggs, to justify
the use of tests which hava a disparate effect on the basis
of race.
There is no question in our view that there was a
disproportionate impact, the record seems to justify that.

34
Plaintiffs' Exhibit 10, when analysed, indicates that blacks
disproportionately were affected by the testing program*
The tests tin at were given, the Beta test and the
Wonderlic A and B, were given to all applicants in the affected
lines, and the rule was that you had to pass the Beta and one
of the other two tests.
So the expert was hired, within a month or two after
this Court’s opinion in Griggs» indicating, incidentally# that
the company must have felt that there was soma disproportionate
impact or some need under Griggs to validate these jobs.
He came there, he spent a half a day, he directed
the tests be given to some incumbents, and went back to the
university and analyzed the results with, some, job ratings by
supervisors, that were also provided.
The EEOC guidelines, which this Court indicated
should have great deference in Griggs, as the Administrative
Interpretation by the agency responsible for enforcement of
the law, and which other courts have said is a useful framework
and a good beginning point and an analysis of a test validation
study, simply were not properly followed in this validation
s tudy.
Essentially, there was no job analysis as all of the
guidelines and all of the professional material seems to
require.

The OFCC guidelines, the Civil Service Commission,

the EEOC, the American Psychological Association Standards

ali say you start by looking at what the job is that you*re
going to validate„ and deciding what the job consists of.
The criterion that was used here was simply how well
does the guy do when hef s feeling right? s© it was a very
subjective criteria.
Sven the way the export testified, we believe that
testing program could not continue, and was properly
enjoined because he had studied only eight lines in five
departments, and without a job analysis it’s impossible to
verify the inference that he made that this made it proper to
use all three tests in 13 lines and 18 departments.
I think, on tills record, the Court should decline,
and I would so recommend, the invitation of the petitioners
and amici to evaluate the testing guidelines of EEOC and
— on the question of whether they are so stringent that
they could never be followed.

This is just not the case or

the record on which that issue should be raised.
On back pay, turning to that, we start with the
proposition that the congressional scheme in Title VII was to
look to the federal courts for the ultimate enforcement of
the Act, and in so doing Congress vested the courts with the
necessary discretion to carry out the purposes of the Act.
Thus, the statute says the courts may grant
injunctions, it says they may award bade pay.
The standard for the exercise of the Court's

36
discretion in such situations, in our view, is to effectuate
the purposes of the Act.
What the Court of Appeals said in this regard is not
that back pay is Mechanically compelled, but that where there
is a class of identified victims who may have suffered economic
lo3s because of the defendant's unlawful employment practices,
unless there is some reason not to, the court of equity should
proceed to design and issue ‘that kind of an order which will
make those victims whole as nearly as may be,
We find this to be a reasonable formulation,
consistent with this Court's decisions and with other decisions
under Title VII.
QUESTIONS

In making its — in exercising its

discretion in the district court, would it have been
appropriate for the district court r.o take into account the
efforts of the employer to provide training courses arid to take
new steps after 1964 and again after 1968 to try to meet these
problems?
MR. TURNER:

I think that would be a proper subject

for the district court to address; as you indicated in the
Griggs opinion, Your Honor, it certainly can never be error
for a court of equity to address the question of good faith
that, as the

Court there said, good intent does not redeem

the employer's conduct, since Congress directed the thrust
of the Act to the consequences of employment practice not

simply -their motivation
So, while we think it’s perfectly proper for a
district court to look at good faith of a party, —
QUESTION: Well, -in Griggs, the employer had not
abandoned the high school diploma requirement, as they had
hero? is that not correct?
MR. TURNER:

I believe the high school diploma

requirement was still in this case at the time of trial, toe,
Your Honor.

That was on© of the —

QUESTION:
MR. TURNER;
QUESTION:

When was the —
— decisions of the district court.
Whan was the high school diploma

requirement abandoned in this case?
MR. TURNER:

In this case, the district court's

order said that since the Wonderlic tests were substantially
an equivalent of high school measure, that he did not reach
the question of th© validation effort that had been made as
to high school examination -- or high school diplomas, and
he was enjoining their continued use.
QUESTION; Do you have any comment to make about th©
general statement, which I do not associate with any particu­
lar figures, that there was very little response by employees
to the training program developed by the union and the company
jointly?
MR. TURNER:

Well, I've studied the record only,

38

and that's the limit of my experience in this case# Your Honor,
and I don't recall any statistics in the record as to the
participation.

I know there was some, and I know it was

minimal„
But the explanation for itf I’m sorry I can't give
you.
QUESTION; Would that be an appropriate factor for the
district judge to take into account in exercising his discretion
about back pay?
MR. TURNER*
But the

I should think so, yes, sir.
w€* also think that a court faced with

such a question ought to start with the purpose of the statute,
and that the general principle that «re would urge is that, as
between an innocent victim of discrimination and the perpetrator
or the employer or union violating the lav/, the economic loss
presumptively, or initially at least, ought to fall on the
people that violated the law and not the innocent victim.
QUESTION; Well, you concede, I take it, that this
not quite as simple a matter in determining a violation of law
as it is in some other areas?
MR. TURNER;

Oh, I think that’s right, Your Honor.

The record here is quite lengthy and quite detailed as to
the way Title VII was applied, and how it affected the senioritysystem and how the lines of progression had to be merged,
because they were segregated.

All those things a court has

39
to go into in great detail,

When it concludes that there

has been a violation? a pattern of practice? if you will?
of violating Titio VII? -then we think that any identifiable
victims who can prove that they've suffered economic loss
because of that pattern of practice? ought normally to receive
back pay*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. TURNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE EQUAL
EJ5PL0YMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AS AMICI
CURIAE
MR. TURNER:

— Resumed

Thank you, Your Honor,

When we adjourned, we ware —- I was discussing the
good faith requirements in response to the question of the
Chief Justice.
Certainly we believe it’s relevant, as I indicated,
whether a defendant in a Title VII action conducted himself
with good faith, as the Court indicated in Griggs ? but that
cannot serve as the justification, in our view, for a blanket
rule that no one gets back pay.
The problem identified by the Court of Appeals her®
was that the district court, apparently without consideration
of che “make whole" philosophy of th® Act, had declined to
consider back pay for any member of the victim's class,
regardless of the individual merits of their claim,
QUESTION;

Yes, but the Court of Appeals didn't

just remand to the district court for perhaps additional
consideration, it itself directed th© award of back pay, didn*

41
it?
MR* TURNERS

Well, that, Mr. Justice, could not

happen as a practical matter unless there were some e-dditiona
proceedings in the district court. The back pay amounts had
not been determined, and the identities of who would be
entitled to it had not been determined yet.
QUESTION; But 'the district court’s discretion as to
’whether or not there was to be back pay, if the loss were
made out, has been taken away by the Court of Appeals?
MR. TURNER;

I think the standard that the Court of

Appeals used, and the correct one, is to look to the purposes
of the law, the "make whole" purposes.

As I say, the Court

of Appeals decided, and I think correctly, that the district
court had not used that correct standard, that it had used
rather an abstract equity standard, and had not referred to
the purposes of the Act and the purposes of the "make whole"
provisions of restitution.
QUESTION*

Did the Court of Appeals in terms hold

that the district judge had abused his discretion?
MR. TURNER;

Not in so many terms — in so many

words, Your Honor, no,
QUESTION;

Isn’t that the way it’s ordinarily don©

when there is -MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Well, that’s —
— discretion involved, and

42

MR*, TURNER?

If you wanted to phrase it that way ,

if you wanted to ask me was there an abuse of discretion, I’d
have to say yes. But I*d hasten to add that the

such abuse

as there was was a failure to consider the remedial purposes

of. the Act in the "make whole" provisions which Congress, in
'72, had virtually ratified as the purpose of the Act -*»
ratified court decisions to that effect.
QUESTIONs

Well, rather, can you say that the

Court of Appeals really held the district court erred in not
exercising its discretion according to the "make whole”
standard? can you say that?
MR. TURNER:

That

that would b© our formulation,

sir.
QUESTION; Well, if that were so, I gather the remand
would be an exercise in discretion according to the "make whole”
standard, wouldn't it?
MRo TURNER;
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER;
of Appeals opinion.

That's correct.
Is that what the remand is?
There is no remand stated in the Court
However, as I indicated in answer to

Justice Rehnquist, there has to be additional proceedings
before any back nay can be awarded. There ar© 00 claimants for
>

back pay.
Now the question before the Court is which one of
those i3 entitled to it*

43
QUESTION; Well, doesn't the Court of Appeals foreclose an independent determination by the district court
according to the correct standard to "make whole"?
MR, TURNER;

Oh, I think not0

The — as we read

the Court of Appeals opinion, what they were saying was that
normally, unless there's some reason not to, a class of
victims of racial discrimination will be entitled to be mad©
whole for any economic loss they've suffered.
The next step in that procedure, it seems to me, is
to go back to the district court and make 80 determinations
of whether there's an economic loss and, if so, how much.
QUESTION: This is essentially an accounting process,
though, is it not?'
MR* TURNERS Well, I -think —
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER;

The only tiling remaining to be done?
I think that's not entirely true.

Now, we've indicated in the brief that reliance
on female protective legislation, for example, might be a
basis for some discretion. There would be -the misconduct of
particular individuals, as in G reen v. Me Don ne 11 _ _ Do ug las.
If you recall the facts there, an applicant had misbehaved, or
criminally misbehaved in connection with the company.
QUESTION; Would th© district judge be free, in your
view, to make inquiry into whether or not a particular
claimant had taken advantage of the union and the company's

44
joint training program, and put that in -the scales against his
recovery.
MR. TURNER; Well, if that’s where it belonged in the
scales, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION; Well, I thought you said earlier that it
did belong there, before lunch.
MR. TURNER;

1 said it was relevant.

Hex*?, I'm not

— I would not concade that it should be controlling.

You

would have to know why the man didn't take part in it, if he
didn't? what the program was? what you got if you graduated
from this school or training program? x^hether you

if it was

just a literacy business, how tlx at related to your job.

And

it would seem to me you would have to make a kind of equitable
judgment that I'm outlining.
And there are, in the Phelps Dodge case, in one of
the footnotes, the Supreme Court indicated the kinds of
discretion that the Labor Board had normally used in deciding
to award back pay.
And it said it was not mechanically compelled, that
there was discretion, and yet the over-all goal of making the
individual x*hole for any economic loss he'd suffered by a
violation of the law should be the touchstone.
There would also be the element of apportionment of
the loss «— of the back pay award, between the two defendants,
that would also call for some discretion.

If there was an

45

applicant class, that might be another area of discretion,
very seriously for the district court to consider»
The other special circumstance cited by the district
court was the delay in bringing the issue forward, involving
back pay, aside from 'die ■»«* thank you very much»

Mr* lowden, I believe there * s ten minutes remaining
for the petitioners’ side here.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS V8 LOWDSN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER ALBEMARLE PAPER COMPANY
MR. LOWDEN:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justies, may it please the Courts
I’m afraid this will be a. little disjunctive,
I’ve got about five points I want to make and they’re not
really connected, but X*d like to make them if I possibly
can*
First of all, in the government's brief, they
indicate that we don’t have any quarrel with their guidelines,
and that we didn’t prove that the guidelines weren't un­
reasonable.
At the present time ™— let me say this firsts
1966 guidelines and the 1970 guidelines were published
without any public opportunity to comment,- they were just
published and put into effect.

The

46
Under the new law, they are now having hearings on
another set of guidelines, in which all the government agencies
involved in equal opportunity will be involved.

And they’ve

had some testimony on the guidelines, and I’m quoting from the
BN A Daily Labor Report for January 13, 1975, which is also in
our brief at page 36.

And at the hearings on the guidelines,

the people who testified, described them as unworkable,
incomprehensible, technically unsound, too stringent,
beyond the state of the act, ambiguous yet restrictive,
unnecessary, punitive? and as one witness said
QUESTION?

Do these comments, Mr. Lowden, have any

effect on the validity of -the guidelines, in so far as they are
promulgations of the EEOC?
MR. LOWDEN:

I think that the new guidelines are

supposed to have relaxed the old ones. And so we're talking
about the new proposal, that is supposed to have relaxed some
of the requirements of the other guidelines.
And one witness at that hearing was quoted in the

BNA as saying that they are "just irrational, unreasonable,
and i rap os 3 ib 1 e. ”
And I wish I had time to point out in detail why I
subscribe to that same view.
I would like to clear up one other thing, and that
is what these tests apply to.

This was not ~ you can't

take a given point in tins and say that's the facts of these

47
casas,

‘Thia is a moving tiling, having new machinery, drop

in various lines and so forth? so that, sincss about the times
of the validation study reads by Dr. Tiffin at that time, we
only used the tests in four departments?

the power plant,

the B paper mill? the pulp mill? and technical services0
And you’ll find, if you look at his study, that he
found validations in all of those lines. And this business
about using it in 13 lines in eight departments, that's the
way it was in 1367, but that was not the facts in 1971.
On the supervisory ratings, what Dr. Tiffin actually
did was have these people’s immediato supervisors — who.
incidentally, have done all these jobs, because we get our
supervisors in the same way, up through the ranks *— to
rat& employee A against employee B.

And the question they

answered which one was better, Tom or Jack? and then they
go, which one in better, Tom or Bill,

So they only — they

didn’t rate them in order, they just took each one:

which

one of these two can do th© job better?
And wc? submit that that is a fundamental question
that supervisors answer every day in the week, it’s one of
th® most basic things that they’re paid to know.
Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about the high
school education.
In 1365, the company waived the high school educa­
tion for all incumbents, so there was no longer a requirement

for them*

W® continued it up until the time of the trial?

and the judge knocked it out, and we did not appeal that.
And of course the evidence is that we put the tests
in because the high school education requirement didn’t, predict
anything*
Furthermore, it hasn't been said, but the injunctive
decree in the district court, w® consented to? that was really
a consent deer©®*
And one other idling hasn’t been said, and I feel the
Court should know:

that as early as September the 24th, 1969,

before there was any back pay or anything ©Is© in the case, 1
asked the judge for a trial; and ha denied it*
On® other thing, on back pays

the judge, in effect,

has given all these people a trial on back pay.

He ruled

in the pretrial hearing that back pay was an issue.

He said

he would hear it, and if it got too complicated he’d send it
to a Master, but that we were going to start this trial on
Monday morning, and ws were going to go for two weeks, and
if we didn’t finish, we’re coining back; and he wanted every
single thing we wanted him to hear in there; but when he
adjourned, that was it.
They had a courtroom full of these employees.
testimony of 16 of them is in the record.

The

And the kind of

testimony — and I read this last night — they put on a man
on the stand, and when he got through the judge said, "Well 9

49
what job is it that Albemarle didn’t give you because of your
race?'*

And he said, "None".
He said, "What job is it that you want?"

He said,

"I want the job I've got now„"
And this is the kind of testimony that is the back™
ground of the judge's exercise of his discretion.
And if we go back on the issue of back pay, as I
understand it we take these people and try to find out by,
through evidence, what job they could do? was there ever an
opening in it? what were the rates paid? could they have
qualified.

And it will be another elaborate proceeding all

over again'.
In conclusion —
QUESTION;

But you never objected to conducting

this matter as a class action at all?
MR, LOWDENs
we made.

Yes, sir.

Way back in 1967,

That’s the first motion

The first motion we made, Your

Honor, was that it wasn’t a proper class action under Rule
23, and that is the time when we raised the question about
the charges being filed.
And in 1967, the district judge, Judge Larkins at
that time, overruled that motion; and we tried to — when
we got before Judge Dupree, he said he wasn't going to act
as a district court — I mean an appeal court, and anything
that Judge Larkins ruled on we could forget about; he wasn’t

50
going to change that,,
So ho didn’t allow the motion on that.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the class hadn’t been designated

MR. LOWDENs
QUESTION:

Well, —
There hadn't been a certification, had

there?
MR. LOWDEN:

Yes, the class was described by Judge

Dupree, the way these cases ~~
QUESTION:

Well, Dupree didn't describe it until

'71.
MR. LOWDEN:

But the way thea© cases go in the

district courts, they say, We'll treat it as a class action
for purposes of discovery, and after they get through with all
of that business, then we'll coir;® back and describe what the
class is, in light of what that, shows up.
And this is a voluminous process.
QUESTION:

Very costly.

1 notice at page 46 of the Appendix that

Judge Dupre© on June .15 of '71 ordered the plaintiffs to mace
a more specific answer to an interrogatory you had submitted
as to the claims of the damages.

Did the plaintiffs ultimately

comply with that order?
MR. LOWDEN:
did.

We claim they did not, they claim they

They came bade and instead of tailing us what job the

man would have had, what job he was qualified for, they want
back and took a couple of people who ware employed at about the

same time, one might be white, and he made $10,000 a year?
one might be black, and he made $8,000 a year.

Then they

would claim that shows that the man was damaged,
And we claim that we were entitled at that trial
to have known what job was it that we didn't give the man
that he wanted, that he was qualified for? and that if they
had proved a case like that, then you might have a different
situation on damages.

But here nothing was shown.

In fact, witness after witness said;

"I'm happy,

Judge, with the job I got"? "all I want's a raise".
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr, Lowden.

Thank you, gentlemen.
