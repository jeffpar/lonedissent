MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll hear arguments

73-1595, Colonial Pipeline against Traigle.
Mr. Kean, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. GORDON KEAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. KEAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
My name is Gordon Kean.
line Company.

I represent Colonial Pipe­

They are here on appeal from the decision of

the Louisiana Supreme Court.
This case presents, I thinlc, for decision the
question of just how far the States may go in fractionalising
the doing-business concept, in an effort to levy an excise
tax on a purely interstate business before reaching outer
limits permitted by the commerce clause.
This is the first time this Court has addressed
itself to this specific question, as I appreciate it, since
1964, when the Court decided the General Motors case by a
divided court.
In the interim there have been several State court
decisions which have related to the question, as to which this
Court declined to accept jurisdiction.

And as a consequence

of those actions by this Court in declining jurisdiction in
the State court cases that raised the issue, the Louisiana

4
Supreme Court commented,, in passing upon the question,that
there had been a serious inroad in the traditional immunity
of purely interstate business operations.
For this reason I think the Court here, because of
the facts and the background of the Louisiana lav? that I shall
detail to the Court, had a unique opportunity to again declare
where the line is to be drawn.
The facts, as I outline them in the law under which
this case occurs, I think place the issue in rather sharp
focus.

So that the Court is in a position to decide whether

or not and how far the States may go in fractionalising the
business concept as a basis for the tax.
The Colonial Pipeline is a Delaware corporation.

It

operates in interstate commerce, transporting for others as a
common carrier, under the jurisdiction of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, refined petroleum products for others.
Under these circumstances, this is not a case such as
that before the Court in General Motors,

which is the last

time this issue was before the Court, because Colonial does
not own and does not deliver in the State of Louisiana any
of the products which it transports through its lines.
Neither is this an "in lieu" tax case, such as this
Court used as a basis for distinguishing the Virginia franchise
tax which was before the Court in 'the second Railway Express
case from Virginia.

5
This tax is levied by the very express language of
the Louisiana statute in addition to all other taxes which
are paid by Colonial Pipeline in the State of Louisiana.
As I indicated, Colonial is an interstate carrier.
QUESTION; Well, what other taxes are paid by
Colonial as —
MR. KEAN:

Colonial pays, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

the property tax on its facilities, which are located in the
State of Louisiana; it pays an apportioned income tax, based
upon income derived from its operations in that State; it
pays the sales and use tax in connection with such operations
as it conducts in the State; it pays all of that range of
taxes, just as any other operator in the State would pay.
Our position is that with respect to the franchise
tax, that there is nothing which Louisiana gives to Colonial
as a basis upon which to levy that tax.
Our Position is that Colonial is operating in inter­
state commerce as a corporation, and under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States it has then derived the
right to operate in interestate commerce, and therefore
Louisiana gives to — gives to Colonial, with respect to the
privilege of franchise tax, nothing for which they could
demand compensation.
We do not contend that -Colonial under the traditional
cases, decided by this case [sic], does not owe, the property

6
tax, that it doss not owe the income tax or the sales and use
tax? all of which this Court has clearly recognized, that the
interstate carrier must be responsible for.
QUESTION:

are you ejecting to the imposition of

the income tax by Louisiana,, as well?
MR» KEAN:

No, srr, we do not»

QUESTION: Well, if you prevail here, what's to
prevent Louisiana from merely increasing the rates of its
income tax by the same amount as your franchise tax?
MR. KEAN:

Well, I think if they increased the rates

of the corporation income tax, they've got to increase those
rates across the board.
Certainly they couldn’t single out interstate
commerce as a basis for a differential in income tax payment
in the State of Louisiana from what they would otherwise
establish for other companies operating in that State.
QUESTION:

Let me put it another way, then.

Explain for us the how, that Colonial's tax burden in Louisiana
is different from the burden borne by domestic corporations.
MR. KEAN:

As 1 view it, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

Colonial pays the property tax for which it has the right to
— and to get police protection, fire protection, any other
protection that a State would afford under those circumstances.
Colonial, as an interstate carrier, as I see it,
if it is compelled to pay the Louisiana privilege tax, for no

7
right which Louisiana itself gives to Colonial,, then under
those circumstances we have a tax on interstate commerce
which, I say to the Court, is prohibited by the prior
decisions of this Court, and if it is permitted, then under
the circumstances we have a situation where the States can
then control the question of interstate commerce against the
very principle that the commerce clause was created for»
QUESTION; Well, then I go back to my other question
Why can't Louisiana accomplish the same thing by increasing
the income tax across the board, if you will?
MR» KEAN;

Well, they could perhaps increase the

income tax across the board, so that all of the corporations
in the State of Louisiana pay an increased income tax; and
under those circumstances it may well be that they would
accomplish dollarwise the same result.
But I say to the Court again that where this tax
is levied on the privilege, upon doing business in corporate
form, as the Louisiana Supreme Court construed it to be, then
that gets to the authority and right of the corporation to
exist.

And under those circumstances, if that corporation is

engaged in interstate commerce, solely in interstate commerce
then it's our view that the State has the right to, through
the power of taxation on the privilege or the right to do
business in corporate form, to, in effect, destroy interstate
commerce.

8
QUESTION;

You say, then, in effect, that even

though Louisiana can, and I gather it does, impose this same
tax on domestic corporations, it car t impose it on your
client?
MR, KEAN;

That s worrect,

My position, Mr«

Justice Rehnquist, is that the privilege tax or the tax upon
the right to do business ii? corporate form, as the Louisiana
Court construed this tax to be imposed on, is a right which
Colonial, engaging as it does in interstate commerce, derives
from the Federal Constitution,

tod therefore Louisiana gives

to Colonial nothing for which they could expect recompense .

tion.

from doing business in Louisiana?

in the State of Louisiana.

Well, you don’t think —- do you think

privilege we're going to charge you a hundred dollars a year.,
MR. KEAN:

I don't think so, as long as that

business was a purely interstate business.

Because, under

those circumstances, you’d give to the State the right to
deny interstate business within its borders based upon the
payment of some fee.

Well, that may be true.

But, at the

same time, you are doing business in Louisiana.

— the right to carry on the interstate

Because our position is, under decided cases of

this Court, that the right to carry on a purely interstate
business is derived from the Constitution, and therefore
there’s nothing for us to pay Louisiana in the way of a
privilege tax to carry on that business.
QUESTION:

Of course, wasn't that argument made when

11
Northwestern States was argued here, and rejected -- and I
think I’m still troubled by the distinction between the
income tax, which you do not contest because of the North­
western case, and this one.
MR. KEANs

Well, as I appreciate the difference,

Mr. Justice Blackmun, and the distinction made by the Court
in the Northwestern States case, is that they were dealing
there with an income tax.

And the Court there taking the

position, somewhat as the Court has done in the case of the
property tax, that this was not a tax on interstate commerce,
it was a tax on income, and if that income tax was fairly
apportioned, so you didn't have a multiplicity of the same
kind of tax, so as to burden interstate commerce, then under
the circumstances that was a constitutionally acceptable
tax.
Now, xi/e're here dealing — and I go back again, if
1 may, and let me try. to give a little bit of the background
of Colonial's operations in the State of Louisiana.
They operate, Colonial operates a pipeline system,
as I say, transporting refined petroleum products for others,
of some 3500 miles of pipeline, all the way from Houston,
Texas, to the New York Harbor area.

Some 258 miles of that

pipeline traverse the State of Louisiana.
The Collector admits, and Louisiana courts found,
that everything that Colonial was doing in the State of

12
Louisiana was related to and an integral part of its interstate
movement of these products.
Colonial does no intrastate business in the State of
Louisiana.

Everything it dee? is related to interstate

movement of its product.
And under the circumstances, there are no local
activities, as we view them, in the State of Louisiana upon
which Louisiana may lay the privilege tax, that is, local
activities sufficiently separate from the flow of interstate
commerce to permit that tax.
QUESTIONS

It dees take oil out and put oil in at

stations in Louisiana, doesn't it?
MR. KEANs

They pick up oil from Cities Service

refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and they transport that
further to the east, outside the State.

They deliver refined

products to a station in Baton Rouge from a refinery in Texas.
But there are no movements of its products from a
point in Louisiana to another point in Louisiana.

All of the

movements of its products, however they may come, either come
from out of the State into Louisiana, or from Louisiana out of
the State? and in the majority of the instances it*s primarily
a matter of simply moving the oil or the refined petroleum
products through a pipeline that traverses the State of
Louisiana.
So I say to the Court that there are no local

13
activities separate from the interstate movement in Louisiana.
And under the circumstances, if we hold that this
tax can be validly levied upon Colonial, then I say to the
Court, contrary to prior decisions of this Court in cases
such as Spector Motor, that we have now granted the States
the authority to levy a tax upon the privilege of doing purely
interstate business, contrary to what I believe was the concept
behind the commerce clause of the United States Constitution.
Now, let me make a little — several further points
with respect to the facts, so that the Court will appreciate
them fully.
And I think the background of the statute, the
Louisiana statute, puts this matter in sharp focus.
Prior to 1970, the Louisiana tax was interpreted as
being imposed upon the privilege of doing business.

And this

same Colonial Pipeline Company litigated in the Louisiana
courts the question of whether or not that tax, so imposed,
violated the commerce clause of the United States Constitution,
and the Louisiana courts held, citing the Spector Motor case,
that the tax as applied to this purely interstate operation
violated the commerce clause, and the Louisiana courts ordered
a refund of the taxes which Colonial had paid under protest
in connection with the levy of the privilege tax.
Louisiana, in 1970, made some revisions in its
franchise tax, so as to include what they call alternating

14
incidents or "alternative incidents", which in reality were
nothing more than a restatement of what constituted doing
business.
And the tax was paid under protest again, and
Colonial took the position that there had been no substantive
change in the operating incidents of the tax, and under those
circumstances, the first Colonial case, which had been decided
by the Louisiana Court, was dispositive of the issue.
The Louisiana District Court and the Louisiana
Court of Appeals agreed 0

And when the case went to the

Louisiana Supreme Court under writ, the Louisiana Supreme
Court took the position that in reality there was no sub­
stantive change in tie statute, that the tax, even before the
1970 amendment, was not imposed upon the privilege of doing
business, but was imposed upon the doing of business in
corporate form.
And then took the position that that doing of business
in corporate form was a local activity upon which Louisiana
could impose — place a levy, this franchise tax, without
violation of the commerce clause.
I believe if this Court will read the statute
before 1970 and after 1970, it will come to the conclusion,
as did the lower courts in Louisiana and, in fact, th4
Louisiana Supreme Court, that there was no change in the
operating incidents of the tax, because doing business in

15
corporate form was the manner in which you carried out this
interstate business of Colonial; and, under the circumstances,
the cases were parallel cases, and should have reached a
similar result.
Now, I suggest to the Court that there is no
distinction — as a matter of fact, it seems to me there is
more threat to the commerce clause by saying that you can
impose a tax upon the business — on doing interstate business
in corporate form, than otherwise; because that is the
traditional method in which interstate business is conducted.
And under the circumstances, it appears to us that
the case is in the same posture it was at the tixae of the
first case, but if we accept it as having some distinction
by reason of the 1970 amendment, I still say to the Court
that this is a, tax upon interstate commerce, which this
Court has recognised as beyond the bounds of the States
with respect to the commerce clause; and under the circumstances, the Louisiana Supreme Court ought to be reversed.
Nov/, the Louisiana Supreme Court stated that the
operating incidents of the tax was, and I quote, 55 the local
incident tax is a form of doing business rather than the
business done by that corporation.5'
And they emphasised it by saying that the thrust
of the statute is to tax the doing business in Louisiana in
corporate form.

16
And I don't believe that there is any distinction
that makes the difference between a v.ax upon a privilege of
doing business and a tax which imposes it upon the doing of
business in corporate form.
QUESTION:

Do you know whether any of the airlines

are subject to this tax* airlines that —
MR. KEAN:

That are operating in Louisiana?

QUESTION:

Yes.

Without making any local stops,

except one.
MR. KEAN:

I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

don't know.
I really have never explored that question with the
Collector of Revenue.
QUESTION:

I take it your view would be that

Louisiana could not tax an airline that was coming in and
landing merely at New Orleans, and then picking up passengers
and going out?
MR. KEAN:

Well, that —

QUESTION: Discharging and picking up.
MR. KEAN:

It would depend, I think, on whether

or

not the Court could find some activities that the airlines was
conducting in the State of Louisiana, that they were indeed
engaged in local activities separate from that interstate
operation, which might then form the basis of the tax.
For example, if that airline was bringing materials

17
in to Baton Rouge, where it maintained a warehouse, and was
there storing those materials for some period of time before
it was delivered to its customers, then I would say that that
constitutes an intrastate activity, unrelated and unnecessary
to carrying on the interstate business of the airline, and
under the circumstances the State of Louisiana would wall
have a basis for levying the tax upon the privilege of doing
business.
Based upon the imposition of it, upon the local
activity being conducted by that company.
But where the sole and only activity done by the
company in the State of Louisiana is that which relates to
interstate commerce, I say to the Court that you have to come
to a different conclusion.
Otherwise the States then have the right to
- *

determine whether or not corporations engaged in interstate
commerce can truly exist in the States in which they operate.
1 think if the Court looked —
QUESTIONS

Well, you're protected to a certain

extent by the fact that this tax applies equally to domestic
corporations.
MR. KEANs

Well, this Court held, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, in Spector Motors, which was dealing with the
transportation operation, —
QUESTIONS

Well, isn't Spector pretty much of an

IS
anomaly — 3 mean it's really not consistent with the Memphis
case that went before, and it's really not consistent with
several of the cases that have come afterwards.
MR. KEANs

I don't think that the cases which came

after make any change in the law so far as Spector is concerned.
For example, the first Railway Express case in Virginia, the
Court reached the same identical conclusion that they reached
in Spector,, which was that where you had a tax imposed solely
upon the privilege of doing interstate business, it was
violative of the commerce clause.
Virginia then came back, as the Court may recall,
in the second Railway case, and provided that their tax was
an "in lieu” tax, in lieu of the ad valorem tax on intangibles
and rolling stock of the Railway Express Agency.

And under

those circumstances, this Court characterized the Virginia
tax in the second Railway case as being in the nature of an
ad valorem tax, which was acceptable under a long line of
decisions that this Court had rendered.
But I know of no case

I know of no case which has

been decided by this Court, and Spector and the first Railway
Express case to the contrary, which holds that the States have
a right to levy a franchise or privilege tax upon a business
that’s engaged exclusively in interstate commerce.
And it seems to me that in logic and in good reason
that has to be the case.

19
For example, in Spector and in the first Railway
case, this Court established the rule which stated that the
commerce clause prohibits a State franchise tax, the operating
incidents of which falls upon the privilege of carrying on
exclusively — and I emphasize the word '‘exclusively” —•
interstate transportation in and through the state.
Now, there — if we now permit, contrary to what
Spector holds, the States to say that we now have the right
to tax the very business means by which an interstate carrier
operates, then it has the right to tax the existence of that
business. And it has the right under those circumstances, if
we grant to the States the power to tax that business, going
back over many years of history before this Court, the
recognition that the power to tax includes the power to
destroy.
QUESTION:

But you're protected by the principle

that a tax on interstate commerce can't discriminate against
interstate commerce.

And here you don't really claim any

discrimination.
MR. KEAN:

No, I don’t feel that interstate commerce

xs protected by apportionment of — by apportionment of a
privilege tax.

Because the tax there is laid upon interstate

commerce, and no manner of apportionment can deny that fact.
And. m Spector,

cAaiupie, cn.is cc

squarely said

that the fact that the ta* wa3 fairly apportic
did not save
the tax.

20

And I think it's logical and reasonable that that
should be the case, because even if you — even if you apportion
it fairly, nonetheless you're in a position, as I see it, for
the State to say:

We give you the right to come into the

State under these circumstances, we lay down the conditions
under which interstate commerce will be carried on through
the State of Louisiana.
And by that means have vested in the States the
right to control and decide the manner in which interstate
commerce can be conducted among the States, contrary to the
principle that the commerce clause was established to achieve.
QUESTION:

But Northwestern States came along after

MR. KEAN:

It's my recollection it did, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And at least that was some kind of an

Spector.

incursion on Spector, wasn’t it?
MR. KEAN:

No, sir.

But —

QUESTION:

That was apportioned income tax, wasn’t

it?
MR. KEAN:

That was an apportioned income tax.

QUESTION:

Yes, of course, it t^as apportioned income

QUESTION: But this is an unapportioned franchise tax.
MR. KEAN:

But my noinfc is this is the same argument *—

QUESTION:

Aren't you making the same argument here

21
that was made in Northwestern States?
MR. KEAN:

No, I’m not.

Because, as I pointed out

a moment ago, Northwestern States was dealing with an income
tax.
QUESTIONS

Exactly.

An apportionment of that.

And some States call an income tax a franchise tax.
MR. KEAN:
that some States do.

No, sir.

No — well, it may well be

Some States measure their franchise tax

by income.
For example, in the General Motors, there xvas the
franchise tax measured by gross receipts.
perhaps in the Spector

And I think

case there was a franchise tax

measured by income.
But, however it's measured, under whatever circum­
stances it has been stated to be imposed upon, if it was a
tax on interstate commerce directly, as distinguished from a
tax on income which this Court held in Northwestern States
you kind of pull out here, and therefore it"s not a tax on
the commerce itself.
QUESTION:

No, I'm not blaming you for this argument,

I think you're forced into it by what

I

regard as the

inconsistency of our decisions here, to wit:

Memphis, Spector,

Northwestern States.
MR. KEAN:

Well, I must say, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

in all of the cases which have dealt with the problem, the

22
decisions have been by a sharply divided court.
QUESTION;
MR. KEAN:

Indeed they have, and I —
As a matter of fact, in the Memphis Gas

vs. Stone case, it was not even a majority opinion, as the
Court may recall.

It was, I think, a four-to-three decision.

Anyway it was not a —■ five members of the Court who actually
wrote the majority opinion.
So I say to the Court that this case, as I see it,
with the facts where we have no dispute whatsoever, as to the
interstate character of this common carrier pipeline —
QUESTION:

I think we realize this, and there's not

any question about it, but I ~ I'm just suggesting that the
difference between Northwestern States and this case is a very
thin one.

This Court drew it, but I think it's a very thin one.
MR. KEAN:

I don't share your view, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, that it is a thin one.

I think there are a lot of

narrower constructions that get applied in this field.

But

I can see in my own mind a great distinction between a fairly
apportioned income tax, where the tax is upon the income as
distinguished from a tax upon the privilege of doing interstate
business, x^here the tax is imposed and levied upon the
interstate business itself.
QUESTION; Even though measured by .income?
MR. KEAN;
or even

Yes, sir.

Even though measured by income,

23
QUESTION; Doss that make any sense to you, just as
a practical matter?
MR. KEAN;

Yes, sir.

It makes sense in the same —

because, it seems to me, that if this Court recognizes the
right of the States to levy a tax upon the privilege of doing
purely interstate business, however that is measured, however,
whatever it may be imposed upon, then this Court has made the
breakthrough which permits the States, in my opinion, to
regulate interstate commerce contrary to the theory and
purpose of the commerce clause.
May I save a few minutes for rebuttal?
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Kean,

QUESTION:

Mr. Cook, for tax purposes, what's the

difference between levying a tax — or what’s the difference
between doing interstate business and doing interstate business

MR. COOKs

That is the heart, of this case today.

QUESTION:

And let me add a second questions

If .

Louisiana can impose it on doing busiiiess in a corporate form,
may it impose a tax on doing interstate business in a partner­
ship form or in a sole proprietorship form?
MR. COOK:

The Louisiana Supreme Court recognised

that the State may not — and the State has not attempted
here to impose a tax on the privilege of doing interstate
business in Louisiana.
What the State is attempting and what they have taxed
is the corporation that has — which is on page 26 of the
Jurisdictional Statement — has qualified to do business in
Louisiana.
In 1962, when Colonial first came into the State to
begin laying its pipeline, it did qualify with the Secretary of
State to do business in Louisiana.
They have received a qualification from the Secretary
of State that authorizes them to do anything and everything
that a domestic corporation, another domestic corporation has

26
authority to do, only limited by their own articles of
incorporation.
I would like to point out that the legislative
intent was put into the statute so there could be no ambiguity
about what the purpose of the tax is.

It being the purpose

of the section to require the payment of this tax to the State
of Louisiana by domestic corporations, for the right granted
by the laws of this State to exist as such, the corporation
organization, rather.
And by both domestic and foreign corporations, for
the enjoyment, under the protective laws of the State, of the
powers, rights, privilege and immunities derived by reason
of the corporate form of existence and operation.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kean, as I read the statute, there’s

no apportionment of any kind of this tax; is that correct?
I beg your pardon, I’ve got the wrong advocate.
Mr. Cook.

I’m sorry.
MR. COOK:

No, sir, that’s not correct.

Revised

Statute 47:606 —
QUESTION:

What page of your brief is that on?

MR. COOK:

That's set out in the Appendix to my

brief, on page 45.
QUESTION:
MR* COOK:

What’s the —
I’d like to add that Colonial has not

complained about the apportionment formula or the measure of

27
the tax.
What they have complained of is the imposition of
the tax at all.
QUESTION?

As a matter of information, what’s the

basis of apportionment?
MR. COOK:

I’d overlooked that.

I'll have to go over that.

QUESTION: Well, if you don't remember it, just go
ahead.

I don't want to interrupt you.
MR. COOK:

Now, what is the difference between

taxing the privilege of doing interstate business and the
tax imposed in this case?
It's very simple.

The State is not taxing the

business of transporting natural gas through the State.
tax is not levied on that business.

The

The tax is levied on a

corporation which has voluntarily come into the State and
qualified with the Secretary of State to do business in the
State.
QUESTION: Could a State impose a tax on the
privilege of doing this business in a noncorporate form?
It would have then two complementary taxes.
MR. COOK:
upon corporations.
QUESTION:

No, this -- the tax is only imposed
It's not imposed —
Well, we're talking about constitutional

power.
MR. COOK:

Yes.

28
QUESTION;

And I grant you —- I know that this

tax is imposed on corporations,, and you justify it by saying
that while at least arguendo it would be beyond the poi^er of
Louisiana to tax this business as a business, since it's
purely interstate, but this is valid because Louisiana is
taxing it because it's in corporate form.
And I'm asking you if Louisiana would have the
constitutional power to conduct this business because the
incidents of it was that it was conducted in noncorporate form?
MR. COOK;

If the State granted to the partnership,

or whatever other type of association it was, benefits, local
benefits upon which it could levy a tax, yes.

It does do this

to corporations that qualify with the Secretary of State.
They derive benefits of, the normal benefits of any domestic
corporation would derive from the State.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

And there's nothing left of the interstate immunity,
is there?
MR. COOK;
QUESTION:

The interstate immunity still exists —
If the State can tax

if the State can

tax a purely interstate business by way of a franchise tax,
on the basis of the form in which it's conducted, whether it
be corporate or noncorporate, then there's nothing left of the
exemption, is there?
MR. COOK;

I agree with your statement, except for one

29
point.

The State here does not do that.

In other words,

they do not attempt to do that.
Colonial Pipeline came to Louisiana and qualified,
voluntarily, for whatever reason, to do business in Louisiana.
Now, the extent of their use of that authority is
their own business.

The State is taxing the corporation,

because it's qualified and because the, as the Supreme Court
of Louisiana held, they received protection of the lawful
activities which they conduct in the State.

Which, as in

the case of Memphis Gas —
QUESTION? Well, that would be true *— that would be
true of an individual proprietorship that was running this
pipeline, wouldn’t it?

He’d presumably receive the police

and fire protection and the other protections the State gives.
MR. COOK: That is true, he would receive those
protections, but he would not receive the other corporate
benefits, which, in other words, --QUESTION:

Well, what are these benefits?

MR. COOK:

As pointed out by the Louisiana Supreme

QUESTION?

This isn’t a Louisiana corporation,

MR. COOK:

No, sir, but they have qualified to do

Court --

business in the State.
QUESTION ?

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION: Could they have run the pipeline through

without qualifying?
MR. COOKs

Yes, they could.

The State did not

require them to do so.
QUESTIONS

I suppose if they hadn't qualified, they

would have run the risk that in the event of an explosion the
stockholders could be held individually liable under Louisiana
law?
MR. COOKs

Yes.

Now, Mr. Kean
QUESTIONS

Did they have a statute which prevents

them from going into State court if they have not qualified?
Do you have such a statute?
MR. COOK;

We do have such a statute.

However,

corporations doing exclusively interstate business are
excluded from the provisions of that statute.
And I point that out in my brief, has also been the
State Supreme Court holding that has upheld that statute in
saying that is the construction of the statute.
Now, appellant has pointed out several cases,
attempting to argue that the tax imposed by this statute is
a license tax, as a condition precedent for doing business in
Louisiana; and several of the — several of the cases pointed
out by appellant brought up that issue that you just, asked.
These cases were cited by Louisiana Supreme Court
when it held that the requirement that the State qualify —

31
I mean that the corporation qualify in the State in order to
be able to use the courts of the State, only apply to corpora­
tions doing intrastate business? they do not apply to corpora­
tions doing exclusively interstate business.
QUESTION:

Well now, have I heard your answer to

Justice Stewart's question, which I think followed mine, as to
whether, in your opinion, Louisiana had the power to tax the
doing of interstate business in an individual or sole pro­
prietorship or partnership form?
MR. COOK:

Yes.

I did answer that.

They would if

they gave to the individual, to the partnership the benefits,
local benefits emanating from the State of Louisiana,
emanating from the sovereign power of the State of Louisiana.
QUESTION: Well, suppose Colonial were owned by Mr.
Colonial, let's say, an individual; could they tax him?
MR. COOK:

Not — well, could they tax him?

I

don’t know of any benefits that, they would be passing to him —
QUESTION:

Well, if they specifically expressed the

congressional intent, to make the incidents of the taxation
the privilege of doing this business as an individual pro­
prietorship.
MR. COOK:

Right.

No, he would have the right to

receive the same police protection that Colonial received in
this case.

QUESTION :
MR. COOKi

Unh-hunh, that this —
However, he would not have the right to

receive the corporate benefits that Colonial does.
Now, I would like to point out that —
QUESTION;

Well, I don't know that -- did you answer

my brother Blackmun's question?
QUESTION;

Or Mr. Stewart's question.

QUESTIONi Well, it's really the same question.
MR. COOK;

I thought that I did.

And my answer

would be only if there were local benefits given to —
QUESTION: Well, you mentioned fire protection,
MR. COOK;

Yes.

I said in this case, in the

Colonial case, the corporation receives numerous benefits as
a corporation, in addition to the fire protection, the use of
the highways, the school system and so forth.
QUESTION: Well, those benefits are conferred by
Delaware or wherever — New Jersey, or wherever it is this
place is incorporated.
MR. COOK:

The tax, the power of the State to tax

is only upon entities that emanate from the State.

Do you —

like, for example, domestic corporations, our form of domestic
corporation in Louisiana, and the State would have the power
to tax domestic corporations.
QUESTION:
MR. COOK:

You don't really believe —
Colonial --

33

QUESTION?
HR. COOK?

Go ahead.
Colonial voluntarily cam© to Louisiana,

qualified with the Secretary of State, received a certificate
of —
QUESTION:
MR. COOK:
QUESTION:
to pay a fee?

Did they pay a fee for that?
Pardon me?
Did they get that free or did they have

Piling fee?

MR. COOK:
QUESTION:

I can't answer that question.
Probably did, if it's like any State I

know anything about.
MR. COOK:

Piling fee.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:
never have

Well, when I go to — if I should go; I

but if I should go to the Mardi Gras in New

Orleans, I get police protection and fire protection.

So that

that incident alone wasn't very much of a basis for levying
taxes, is it?
MR. COOK:
QUESTION:
MR. COOK:
QUESTION:
MR. COOK:

I agree with that.
It's the corporate form.
It's the corporation itself, not —Well, don't they pay property taxes?
They do. They pay a property ~ they pay

local property taxes , that go to -QUESTION:

Well, is that or is that not for fire

34

protection and police protection?

That's what the property

tax is, isn't it?
MR. COOK:
use, yes.

That goes to the local parishes for their

This, the local — the property tax is not a State

tax, there are parish taxes.
QUESTION:

It's not a corporate tax, he's not — they

already paid the property tax.
MR. COOK:

They pay income tax.

That's correct,

Right?

and they do pay a local

property tax.
QUESTION:

So what is this other benefit they get?

In addition to all the others.
MR. COOK: The State is levying a tax on the corporation,
on the corporate form of existence,
QUESTION: And it gives what in return?
MR. COOK:

It gives to the corporations the various

corporate benefits they ':rec©ive by virtue of being incorporated.
QUESTION:
MR. COOK:

Name one or two of them.
The absence of individual liability.

The

transfer of assets through the — through stock? continuity of
business? centralization of management.

The normal corporate

benefits that any corporation receives.
QUESTION:

And that's given by Louisiana?

MR. COOK:

It is to the State's — to the corporations

which (1) are domestic or (2) which have qualified -QUESTION:

But one of them you said didn't apply to

35
interstate.
MR. COOK:

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

You said one of those benefits didn't apply

to interstate corporations, didn't yon?
MR. COOK:

It wouldn’t, but the corporation has

voluntarily qualified in the State.
This is no different from the case in the Stone v.
Interstate Natural Gas Company, or really the Memphis Natural
Gas case, except in this case the corporation qualified in
Louisiana to do business.
In Memphis Natural Gas case, they did not qualify to
do business in Louisiana — I mean in Mississippi.
In the Stone case, they did qualify.

They did only

interstate business in the Stone case, and in tne Momp_ni_s_
Natural Gas case.
In the other cases cited by me in our brief to this
Court, each of the highest State courts which has considered
the incident of the tax as one being imposed upon the corporate
existence, the corporate form, has upheld the validity of the
State's power to tax this incident.
Now, appellant cites, or states that the tax in
question is the same as the equivalent of, or is an effective
condition precedent to Colonial doing interstate commerce in
Louisiana.
I'd like to point out, and I made this statement

36

before, that the State of Louisiana did not require Colonial
to come into Louisiana and qualify* as a precondition for
them to do their interstate business.
Now, the cases cited by Mr. Kean in support of his
position are not applicable in this case.

In each of ..those

cases there was an attempt by the State to exclude a certain
type of business, like express companies, in one case a
pipeline company, and to require them, before they did business
in the State, a license in order to be able to do that
business.
Louisiana has not done that.

Louisiana has only

taxed the corporation which has voluntarily qualified in the
State.
As I pointed out earlier to Mr. Justice Blackmim,
Louisiana does not. require that the corporation qualify in
order to be able to use the courts of the State.

There was

intimation to that effect in the case of Graham Manufacturing
v« Holland.

I pointed out that the Louisiana Supreme

Court has so held.
Louisiana does have an occupational license tax,
dr a license tax similar to the cases that Mr. Kean cites in
his argument.

They are imposed by other statutes.

Title

47, section 341 through 405.
This tax, this occupational license
upon individuals, partnerships, corporations,

tax, is imposed
or anybody that

37

comas in ana performs or does the certain types of businesses,
trades or professions conducted in Louisiana.

It makes

no difference the type of business that’s done.

It is a

precondition of doing that type of business, and it only
applies to interstate business done.
Appellant cites the enforcement provisions of the
Louisiana taxing statute as joining with the tax in question
to be an effective license tax or condition precedent on
doing business in Louisiana.
Namely, he cites Title 47, section 401.

That section

only applies to the occupational license tax imposed by
sections not in question before the Court.
I'd also like to point out that this, the enforce­
ment provisions apply to — that the other four enforcement
provisions as cited by him apply to all State taxes.
The constitutionality of these four provisions has not bean
drawn in question in the courts below, nor, as Colonial
complained of the enforcement provisions in the courts below.
I'd like to point out some of the facts about this
case, as far as the amount of investment in the State of
Louisiana.
It's true Colonial owns and maintains 258 miles of
pipeline in the State.

They have an investment there of a

cost to them of $40 million.
QUESTION; They are paying property taxes on that,

38

though, aren't they?
MR» CQOKs

Correct,

All I'm doing is showing the

extent and siso of their investment.

They are there doing

business.
QUESTIONt

Well/ but you5ve taken care of that with

the property tax, haven't you?
MS. COOK;

That is — yes, sir.

This is one-tenth of their total assets, capital
assets.
They also receive substantial revenues that are
apportioned to the State.

During one of the taxable years in

question, 1970, Colonial had a gross receipts of $102 million,
a net income of $25 million? $2 million only of which was
apportioned to Louisiana.
QUESTION:
MR. COOK;

And you taxed that?
That's correct.

QUESTION;

The income tax.

MR. COOK;

That's correct.

In addition, —
QUESTION;

Well, that's what every domestic

corporation —
MR. COOK;

That's correct.

QUESTION;

— paid on each of these.

MR. COOK;

Yes, sir.

There is no difference between the interstate

39
Corporation that — or Colonial in this case,, and they are a
foreign corporation, and a domestic corporation that is
Louisiana domiciled.
I’d also like to point out that —
QUESTION: Well, what's the counterpart tax on a
domestic corporation, if you will spell that out for ms again?
That corresponds to the tax in question in this case.
MR. COOK:
QUESTION:

It is the same tax.

The —

Well, the domestic corporation — let's

assume that you had one that went from Baton

Rouge to New

Orleans, if that were feasible, domestic entirely; they pay
the .income tax, they pay the property tax, and then what else
do they pay?
MR. COOK:

They would pay the corporate franchise

QUESTION:

The corporate franchise tax.

tax and —

MR. COOK:

—- published by the statute in question.

I'd also like to point out that Colonial, when
they built their pipeline across the State of Louisiana,
utilized the State's courts for their expropriation of the
various properties and to build their pipeline.

The

expropriation powers came from the State, the state gave to
the common carriers and to petroleum pipelines the right to
utilize expropriation powers in the State courts to build
their pipeline.

40

QUESTION? Well, if the individual that was postulated
by, I think, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Blackman had
started this pipeline in Texas and went all the way to the
Bast Coast, what would be the situation on — would he be
able to condemn land?
MR. COOK:

Would he be a common carrier?

I —

QUESTION:

As a common carrier?

MR. COOK:

I would have to look — I don't know.

QUESTION: Well, don’t you think that might be quite
important in this case?
MR. COOK:

Yes. Well, no, sir, because that • has not

been an issue in the case.
QUESTION:

No, but you’re speaking of the power to

— of eminent domain is what you’re suggesting.
MR. COOK:

Well, okay.

If we are talking strictly

of the power of the State to do it, then, yes, the State is
granting the individual powers that come from State lax*? not
from the federal law.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you wouldn't be taxing this

individual, or would you?
Would you be levying this tax on that individual?
MR. COOK:
QUESTION:

No, I wouldn’t.
Well, are there any individuals that

you know of in Louisiana that have $40 million invested in a
transcontinental pipeline?

41
MR. COOKs

No, there's not.

QUESTION;

But you might have individuals that have

a substantial sum invested in a trucking concern, running from
Texas to Mississippi?
MR. COOK:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
I'm just wondering what your last

argument, what pertinency it has, in view of the fact that
you catch — you catch them for property and income taxes.
You're not bootstrapping, because ~ and saying, because this
is a substantial investment we tax them there, therefore we
can tax them here also; are you?
MR. COOK;

No, I'm not.

I was simply pointing

out the extent of the investment in the State, and the fact
that they had received, for ex ample, expropriation benefits
under State law from the State and not the federal government.
QUESTION;

But that's not — if I understood your

response correctly, that's not any different from what it
would be if Mr. H. L. Hunt over in Texas had individually
built a pipeline or had run a truck line across.
MR. COOK;

That’s correct.

If —

QUESTION;

The only one —

MR. COOK;

My answer -- my answer to Mr. Justice

Blackmun's and Mr. Justice Stewart's question .is;

If the

State grants to the individual or to a partnership or to anv
type of association benefits that emanate from the State, and

42
not from the federal government, then it's within the power

of the State to tax that benefit.
QUESTION?

But I thought you had conceded that they

would not levy this tax on the individual*
MR. COOKs

They would not levy this tax.

QUESTIONS

Yeah.

MR. COOKs

And the State is not attempting to

levy this tax on the individual.
tax.

It is, in fact, a corporation

It is imposed only on corporations for the privilege of

existing in corporate form.'
QUESTION;

But what Mr. Justice Stewart said, we're

not talking about exactly what the State has done here, we’re
speaking of constitutional power.

And I wonder whether you've

ever answered that question.
MR. COOK;

I attempted to, and I'll attempt to do

it again, and that is this;
If the State grants any powers or rights or
privileges or immunities or benefits of any nature to
individuals that is subject to the State's power to grant
to the individual, and is subject to taxation, yes.
State would have power to tax that.
QUESTION;

The

The State -—

Give me an example of this, because

I detect, I think, an inference that the only thing granted
Colonial is the right to do business in corporate form.
Is this what you're saying?

43
HR. COOK:

That is what is being taxed.

The

State seized upon the local activities, local incidents
that are spelled out in the statute to support that.

The

only thing that is being taxed is the corporate entity; that
is correct.
QUESTION:

But are there any other benefits that

Colonial receives from Louisiana?
MR. COOK:

The benefits are the normal corporate

benefits that any other corporation, domestic or foreign,
receives.
QUESTION:

Well, don’t they have fire protection,

all the rest of this kind of thing, and is this answered by
Mr0 Justice Marshall's comments

Well, that’s taken care of

by the property tax?
MR» COOK:

No, sir.

The property tax in Louisiana

is a local tax by the local parish, it does go for road
improvements, fire protection, and things of that nature.
It does not pay for the State police power or

the police

work.
The State does have a different police setup
between the local parishes and the State,

They do protect

Colonial in the State„
QUESTION:

Well, you referred to before, didn’t

you, to the limited liability, not necessarily that the
State spends money to give Colonial, but that Louisiana

44
recognizes United liability on the part of a corporation
which is qualified to do business in the State? and the other
incidents of corporate life, that it presumably doesn’t have
to recognize, but does recognize, that really aren't
arguably taken up by the property tax or the income tax.
HR. COOK; That is correct.
QUESTION;

And it's taxing all corporations that

do business in Louisiana, domestic or foreign, for these
particular privileges, isn't it?
MR» COOK;

That's correct»

I'd like to point out that the case cited by Mr.
Kean in his argument, in support of the fact that this tax
is beyond the power of the State to tax, is the case of
Spector Motor Company y, O'Connor.

In that case the incidents

of the tax was not the corporation, or the corporate form of
doing business.
The incidents of the tax was the doing of business
in that State»

Just as our occupational license tax

subjected by other statutes impose a license tax on doing of
a particular type of business, or doing a particular type of
trade or profession.
And I submit, and we submit -that it is a distinct
difference between taxing the corporation for the privileged
existence and enjoyment of the privileged immunities in the
State, and taxing a business being done in the State.

45
That’s all.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, fir. Cook.

Mr. Kean, you have a minute.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. GORDON KEAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR* KEAN:

Thank you, sir.

May it please the Court:
I'd like to make several comments.

One has to do

with the argument of counsel concerning the fact that
Colonial is qualified to do business in the State of
Louisiana, and he seems to place great emphasis on that fact,
even though the Louisiana Supreme Court did not.
The fact is, and if the Court will look at Exhibit
P-6 in the Appendix, you will find that Colonial is qualified
to do interstate business in the State of Louisiana.
And if this Court will review the case of Ozark
Pipeline Corporation vs. Monier, which is at 266 U.S», the
Court will find there the question being raised, concerning
the qualification of an interstate carrier in the State at
issue there? and the Court held that it was not a question of
qualification, but a question of what is done pursuant to
that qualification, and where, in the Monier case, nothing
had been done other than interstate commerce, the Court held
that the mere qualification had no bearing, nor created any
right in the State to impose the tax.

46
QUESTIONs

Well, a right doesn’t have to be

exercised, necessarily, to be valuable, does it?
MR* KEANs

I think in the case of the interstate

carrier, if you — the only basis upon which you could levy
the tax, if it please the Court, is on the basis of some
intrastate activity? and under those circumstances, if no
intrastate activity is engaged in* it does become important,

yes, sir*
Thank you*
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2s58 o’clock, p.m*, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
