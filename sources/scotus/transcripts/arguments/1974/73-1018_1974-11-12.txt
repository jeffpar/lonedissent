ORAL ARGUMENT OP HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SACHSE:

Hr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit to review a decision
of that case that held unconstitutional 18 USC 115^, one of
the principal laws regulating the introduction of liquor
into Indian reservations and 18 USC 1161, a law of the same
purpose.
In doing so, it reversed the District Court which
had convicted the defendants in this case.
I think the best way to approach this case is
first with an analysis of the statutes for a few minutes
and then with the exact facts of this case so the facts will
make sense in the context of the law.
The problem of liquor on Indian reservations

has

been a serious problem to Indian tribes and Congress for a
long time and in the early l800fs, Congress absolutely

4
prohibited the introduction of liquor into Indian country
and absolutely prohibited the sale of liquor to Indians who
are under the guardianship of the United States, no matter
where they were.
This remained essentially the law until 1949.
In 1949, the Act, which is now Section C of 18
USC 1154 — that is on page 3 of our brief — was

passed

and that section redefined Indian country — you know
Indian country has been defined to include all the land
inside an Indian reservation.
That Act redefined Indian country for the purposes
of the liquor laws to exclude rights of ways through
reservations and non-Indian communities and Congress, in
making

that amendment, which was just part of a general

set of amendments to 18 USC, said that it was to bring the
statute

more into accord with the way the statute actually

had been enforced.
Then the practical effect of it, of course, was to
say that where there 'were little non-Indian communities on an
Indian reservation, that liquor could be sold there or that
a truck passing through an Indian reservation could not be
stopped because it was carrying liquor.
Then, in 19 —
QUESTION:
a statute.

That is, in the absence of a treaty or

Is there any statute?

MR. SACHSE:

There is nothing in the treaty and

no particular statute that would apply here.

There could be

a treaty that would say, nowhere in the Reservation ever, or
something like that.
Then, in 1953, 18 USC 1161 was passed.
a local option statute.

This was

The Indian people had felt for

some time that the laws totally prohibiting the introduction
of liquor Into Indian reservations was discriminatory
against them and unnecessary.
And Congress, reacting to that, passed a very
limited statute that said, liquor was still illegal in
Indian country as defined by these two statutes but it
could be legally introduced if, number one, it did not
violate state law and, number two, the Tribe passed an
ordinance allowing it to be introduced and that ordinance
was approved by the Secretary of the Interior* and published
in the Federal Register.
That was the degree of control over the intro­
duction of liquor into Indian country that 18 USC 1161
provided.
Mow, the facts of this case:
The Wind River Reservation Is a major reservation
in Wyoming.

The Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes are there.

In 1953, after the passage of this — of 18 USC
ll6l — they took advantage of the new Act and passed an

6
ordinance saying that liquor could be introduced into the
Reservation if it was done so in accordance with state law.
After that ordinance was approved by the Secretary
of the Interior, advertised In the Federal Register — after
they passed that ordinance, the predecessors of the Mazuries
bought a piece of property on the Reservation and opened a
bar.
They then operated that bar for — they had a
valid state liquor license — they operated the bar for 18
years.

Then the Tribe reconsidered the resolution, decided

that it shouldn’t have the reservation be wide open, passed
a new ordinance, an ordinance -— ordinance number 26 —
which provided that to introduce liquor into the reservation ,
that a person henceforth would have to obtain a tribal
license as well as a state license.
This regulation, which set out in some detail the
information that had to be supplied to the Tribe, standards
for obtaining a tribal license, was approved by the Secretary
of the Interior and the regulation looks pretty much like
any municipality regulation on liquor licenses, was approved
by the Secretary of the Interior, advertised in the Federal
Register —
QUESTION:
MR. SACIISE:

’.'/here is the regulation?
The regulation, I am sorry to say,

was not reproduced in the Appendix.

It is in the record and

7
also In here — but it is in the record of the case.
QUESTION:

Here?

MR. SACIISE:
right here.

I mean, it is — I have a copy of it

It is in the record of the case.

QUESTION:

It was introduced at the trial.

MR. SACHSE:

It was introduced at the trial and
a
It was stipulated that it was/validly adopted

regulation and the publication in the Federal Register was
also introduced at the trial.
The regulation allowed an existing bar to continue
until it had to get a new state license and at that time
required it to apply for the Tribal license as well.
The Mazuries did not apply for the Tribal license.
They were notified then to apply.

They then did apply for

the Tribal license, gave the information that was required
and a public hearing was set up by the Tribal Council to
hear their application.
At that hearing, there was considerable testimony —
this is in the record also — of disorderliness at that
bar.

There was testimony that the bar was near a housing

project where a lot of old people lived and that people
came out of the bar late at night making all sorts of noise.
There was testimony that there had been seven or
eight killings on the reservation, all of which had been
associated with the use of alcohol, that there had been

8
fights in this particular bar, that the bar had been selling
to minors.
As a result of this, the Tribe refused the liquor
license to the bar.

The managers then closed the bar for a

period of several weeks.
They then decided to reopen it and reopened it in
defiance of the action of the Tribe.
QUESTION:

At that point, the —

Did all these untoward incidents happen

during the l8~year period or just toward the end of it?
MR. SACHSE:

I don't think the record shoitfs the

particular incident happened, your Honor.
determine from the transcript that was

I am unable to

there whether these

things occurred in the last few days or earlier.
The BIA then closed the bar and the U.S. Attorney
brought a misdemeanor charge against the Mazuries under
18 USC 1154 for operating a bar in Indian country as defined
in that statute without the consent of the Tribe.
At the trial, almost everything that was said up
to now was stipulated.

The stipulation is in the Appendix.

The trial focused on the question of whether the
Mazuries could claim that their bar was in a non-Indian
community and thus was excepted from the Tribal regulation.
The Government introduced witnesses on this point
and the testimony is quite complete on this question.

The

Government showed that the bar was located three-quarters of

9
a mile from Fort Washakie, which is an unincorporated
village at the headquarters of the Tribal Government.
They showed that there had been a housing survey
made a year or so previously to determine the condition of
housing in that area and that it showed,and the man who made
the survey was there and cross-examined, that within a 20
square mile area of Fort Washakie, there were only 212
families living and that of those, 170 and a half were
Indian families and that 4l and a half were non-Indian
families.

The halves were one mixed family that lived in

the area and they counted that family, half each way.
The Government also brought in the superintendent
of the school district there and there was a state school
supported both by federal funds and state funds opened to
all the children who lived in that area.
The superintendent testified that, of 243 students,
that 223 were Indian and the school liras two and a half miles
from the bar.
Mr. Mazurie himself testified that, "So we are
kind of out there by ourselves, you know."
He also testified that his

bar served both

Indians and non-Indians and that when there was trouble, if
there was trouble with Indians, he would call the tribal
police and if there was trouble with non-Indians, he would
call the county sheriff.

10

On the basis of this record* I should say the case
was tried before judge alone and with jury waived and on the
basis of this record, the judge found that the defendants had
opened the bar’ in Indian country and were In violation of
the statute and implicit in that finding, of course, was
that it did not fit in the exception of the statute of a
bar run in a non-Indian community because that xiras the real
point of the testimony at the trial.
Now, the Court of Appeals found that the term
"non-Indian community" is undefined and therefore, no one
could tell whether he was operating a non-Indian community
and therefore, the entire statute, 18 USC 116^, which
prohibits the introduction of liquor into Indian country,
is unconstitutionally vague because it contains this
exception.
The Court went on to say, even if the statute is
not unconstitutionally vague, we doubt that Congress has the
authority to prohibit sales of liquor by a non-Indian on
land that he owns in an Indian reservation and then went on
to say, but even if Congress does have that authority, it
is an unconstitutional delegation of that authority to let
the tribe itself make the decision, even under the limited
circumstances of this statute, as to whether liquor can be
sold within the Indian country and its reservation.
We think, as you know, that this decision of the

11
Court of Appeals is just simply dead wrong, that, first, on
the question of the vagueness of the statute, certainly, one
can postulate a situation in which it might be difficult to
tell whether one is in an Indian community or a non-Indian
community.
Actually, in 25, 26 years of application of the
statute, apparently that kind of problem has not come up but
this is not a First Amendment case.

This is an ordinary

criminal case and the test in a case such as this is not
whether one can find vague areas, but whether the statute
was vague as applied to these defendants.
Congress meant something sensible by the x^ords
"non-Indian community" and there is no sensible definition
of "non-Indian community" that could include a bar threequarters of a mile from the Tribal headquarters in an area
xvith one of the highest concentrations of Indian families
that you often find in an Indian reservation.
I think the Court's — I don't think I need to
recite to the Court its test in United States versus National
Dairy Corporation but that test is applicable and I think
Justice Holmes' statement in the Wertz Bach case quoted
recently by the Court in Broadrlck versus Oklahoma is also
quite applicable in borderline cases, I interpose.
be time enough to consider It when it is raised
whom it concerns.

It will

by someone

12
I think it is quite clear that the Mazurie's knew
they needed this Tribal license.

They only opened the bar

after the Tribe had passed .its ordinance and that as far as
they are concerned, they simply don't have standing to raise
what might be some borderline question in some other case.
Now, on the question of the authority of Congress,
that is absolutely clear that Congress had totally prohibited
sales of liquor in the Indian reservations before it modified
those regulations.
That prohibition covered both Indian-owned and nonIndian-owned land.

The constitutional authority for this

is Article I, Section VIII of the Constitution, which gives
the Congress authority over trade with the Indians and this
Court flatly held that years ago, in United States

versus

Perrin. that Congress has the authority to regulate the sale
of liquor within Indian country whether it is on privatelyheld or publicly-held land and Perrin is not the only case.
Practically every aspect of that law was litigated
at one time or another in the half-a-dozen cases on page
15 and 16 of our brief that support this point.
QUESTION:

Now —

I suppose, Mr. Sachse3 one can

sympathize with the Mazurie's.

They had had this business

for 18 years and all of a sudden, they can’t have it.
MR. SACHSE:

Well, I don't sympathize with them

too much because they opened the business on an Indian

Reservation because the Tribe had made one of two choices,
either to allow or not to allow the introduction of liquor.
Now, they knew that that was not an inexorable
choice, that if things did not work out the Tribe could
change this and when the Tribe did change it, that they
would have to apply for a Tribal license or be totally
prohibited if the Tribe said no liquor on the Reservation.
So they went in to make a profit from the opening
of this Reservation through sales of liquor and there is no
vested interest there that I can see.
And I should point out that, subsequently, the
state also denied their liquor license.
the case moot because they

This did not render

had already been convicted of

the federal offense but the state also, for whatever reasons,
felt that this bar should not continue.
As to the delegation of authority proposition, I
just want to make several short statements.
One is that an Indian Tribe is a governmental
■v;

unit, that this Court has recognized that reservations were
reserved as the area where the Tribe's governmental authority
would apply.
For instance, in the McClanahan case, that a Tribe,
that a state ordinarily does not have jurisdiction inside
an Indian Reservation but narrow exceptions have been
drawn in matters purely affecting non-Indians where the

state will have jurisdiction.
But where an important Indian interest is at issue,
and the sale of liquor within an Indian Reservation., I think,
Is clearly such an interest, that the Tribe does have a
certain governmental authority and there is quite a good
argument that could be made that even without any statute of
Congress, the tribe would have the right to prohibit the
sale of liquor within the Reservation and I refer the Court
to some rather old cases of this Court, the lead one of
which is Morris versus Hitchcock, as stated In our brief.
But here, we don’t have to get into the more
difficult question of a Tribe’s general authority over nonIndians who live on the Reservation because Congress, which
the Court over and over has recognized as having plenary
authority in this area, has specifically granted this
legislative power and has done it in a very limited and
restricted way, with full account for the interests of nonIndians .
The very exception that is attacked for nonIndian communities recognizes and protects a non-I dian
interest here and the requirement that the regulation be
approved by the Secretary of the Interior makes this a very
limited delegation of authority and that it be advertised
in the Federal Register so that everyone will know that it
is there and I point out that this Court has stated numerous

times that in assuming responsibility for the Indians —- I
am thinking here particularly of the Mancari case the
Court decided la3t year, but that relies on a whole line of
cases before it that Congress necessarily has power to do
the things that are reasonably necessary to perform that
trust responsibility and nothing could be a better exercise
of the trust responsibility than to return in this controlled
and

limited way some power to the Tribe to decide whether

this very important problem to the tribe is to be handled by
a complete prohibition or by other methods.
I have one other thing I want to say before I
sit down but I think my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. SACHSE:

You may stretch it for -

Well, I will say this, that I think

behind the Tenth Court’s opinion Is the proposition that an
Indian Tribe shouldn’t ever make a decision that affects a
non-Indian and that the idea that a non-Indian has to submit
himself to the Tribe’s jurisdiction on whether to open a
bar there is simply some way un-non-Indian-American, unwhiteAmerican, or something like that.
But that this Court’s decision in Williams versus
Lee makes it clear that that is not so, that in an appropri­
ate, limited situation, the person

does have to go to the

Tribal authority.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may develop that

[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon from
12:00 o’clock noon to 1:01 o'clock p.m.]
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sachse, you have

about eight minutes left, altogether.
MR. SACHSE:

Unless the Court has some question on

what I have just said. I’ll save this remaining time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Fine.

We may have some

questions later.
Mr. Hamilton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES E. HAMILTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. HAMILTON:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I live in Riverton, Wyoming and we are centered
approximately in the center of the Wind River Indian
Reservation, which is a reservation made up of the Shoshone
and Arapahoe Tribes and which, as I am sure you are aware,
constitutes considerably over 2 million acres.
The history of this reservation has been varied
and sundry with considerable amount of the land being
removed from the reservation by the Federal Government, all
of that north of the Wind River and they then started

17
distinguishing the eases based on what was south of the
Wind River, which is the area which we have which they
called the portion of that which had not been taken away.
Nov/, the basis for the patent in this case which
was rendered to my clients’ predecessor and title was 34
stat. 182 which states, among other things, that the United
States Government, upon the issuance of that patent without
restriction does thereby relinquish all jurisdiction over
that particular portion of land.
So then x-/ho has jurisdiction over that land?

And

that is taken up immediately by Article 21, Section 26 of
the Wyoming Constitution, which says that the minute a
patent is issued, that the land becomes subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Wyoming.
Now, Mr. Mazurie and the Blue Bull, Inc. are both
legal citizens of the State of Wyoming.

They are then

subject to the rules and regulations of dual citizenship,
that of being citizens of the United States of America and
as being citizens of the State of Wyoming.
Enrolled members of the Shoshone and Arapahoe
Tribe, on the other hand, are the beneficiaries of three
levels of citizenship, those of being citizens of the United
States, of the State of Wyoming and of the Shoshone and/or
Arapahoe Tribes.
This is a very exclusive club, a very exclusive

18
group.

You cannot belong unless you have 25 percent Indian

blood on your father's side.
Now, there are many people on that Reservation
who have in excess of 50 percent Indian blood but who were
born out of wedlock and things of that sort.

These people

are not eligible for tribal membership.
You have to pass all of the rules and regulations.
You have to be approved by the tribal council before you
can even belong to it.

There are a few more than *1,000

total enrolled Indians on the Reservation.
There are 25,000 people who live within the
exterior boundaries of that Reservation.

Obviously, the

majority of the people who are there and who are affected
by any rules and regulations of the Tribal Council are nonIndians.

I don't know1 —
QUESTION:

Do you know how many non-Indians,

technically, in the sense you were just talking about?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That is, between whites and the

marginal group who can't fit into the club?
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir.

In other words, I don't

know — the conversation has been, all the way through this
matter at all three levels of courts Including here today,
your Honor, that we are talking about the rights of the
Indians to self-determination, to self-government, as opposed

19
to non-Indians who I guess, as everyone else — now, Just
because you don't belong to the club, does that make you a
non-Indian?

I guess it does.

I don't know.

That is one

of the problems I am having with 1154-C because if I can’t
tell who the players are in the game, then it is pretty —
or what the rules are or what kind of a ball is in play,
then I have a tough time measuring out the field.
So what we have been up against in this case is
trying to determine just what 115*1-0 means.

Does it mean

that the community must be predominantly enrolled Indians?
Does it mean that the community must be pre­
dominantly people of a certain percentage of Indian blood
and, if so, what does it mean, that they must go to an
Indian school or that they must speak some Indian dialect,
that they have a certain color skin, that they shave or
don't shave.
You know, where is the criteria?
There isn’t any \?hich anyone can reasonably
understand.
QUESTION:

My understanding Is that out West it

varies from tribe to tribe.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

There is no standard fed.eralregulation?

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that is true.

That is correct, your Honor.

For a quarter or a 64th or —-

20
MR. HAMILTON:

So far as enrollment is concerned,

yes, sir, that is correct.

But the Shoshone and Arapahoe

Tribes and I have had considerable problems practicing law
up there over the past years in trying to go to the Tribal
Council with people that I felt in my opinion were qualified
to be enrolled and have them summarily dismiss me and say,
we don't want to listen to you, Mr. Hamilton, and, of course,
there is no appeal, of course, and so these people were not
enrolled.
And it is kind of a personality thing up there and
it is a very difficult thing to deal with.
QUESTION:

Could your client have come within any

of the comparable definitions of 115^-C that you alluded to
a moment ago on this?
MR. HAMILTON:

So far as the criteria for

admittance to the club, no, sir, he would not.
QUESTION:

Well, could his establishment have been

deemed within a non-Indian community under any of those
tests?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, I don’t know.

In other words, it says that if the government can
prove — now, please understand, it is not a matter of
affirmative defense on our part.

This is a criminal case and

I differ with my respected colleague here who argued that
we have the burden of proving that we were in a non-Indian

21
community.

We have the burden of proving

nothing here

because we were the defendants in a criminal case.
But the Government — it is a burden of the
Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in this
matter, and in all matters of this sort —
QUESTION:

Mr. Hamilton —

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:
in a state?

Excuse me?

Well, what about a normal criminal case

Frequently the defense of insanity is — the

burden of that is placed on the defendant.
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir, but that is on our

particular statutory procedure which first of all gives it
a choice about whether or not to plead that defense and if
so, then he is subjected to the following conditions.
That is not the case here.
The case here says that the Government has the
duty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt,
One, that you sold liquor — x^hich

we admit.

Two, that you are located within the exterior
boundaries of a reservation — which we admit.
Third, that you are not located in a non-Indian
/

community.
They did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt one
of the elements of this crime, which is that we were not
located in a non-Indian community.

22
You see, what is x^rong with the statute is it has
a double negative in it, which makes it very difficult to
understand in the beginning.

But the United States did not

prove anything in that regard.
grabs.

It was completely up for

Nobody knew, when we walked out of the district

courtroom in Cheyenne, what was going on.
QUESTION:

How did they offer proof in that

respect, by maps?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, your Honor, I have a map of

that reservation which was an exhibit In this case and which
was about 10 feet by 15 feet square and I spread it and I
went and took a red pencil and marked off every piece of
deeded land on that reservation.

It took two and a half

days with two people and a red pencil to do it.
how much there is.

That is

And that map was an exhibit and Port

Washakie was placed there and the land around Fort Washakie
is, in fact, about right in that area, is about 50 percent
red.

So I kept asking both members —- both chiefs — in

other words, both chairmen of the respective tribal councils,
the Arapahoes and the Shoshones, I said, "Where is the
boundary line between the community and the country?"
They didn’t know.
"Where is the — is this place in the community?"
They didn’t know.
I asked Mr. Hobbs, who has been the superintendent

23
of the reservation and worked for the Bureau of Indian
Affairs since 196l5 I saids "Mr. Hobbs, you are the
administrator of this reservation.

Where are the boundary

lines?"
"I don’t know."
I said, "Well, is this in a non-Indian community?"
"I don’t know."
Well, there just wasn't any burden of proof met
at all.
Okay, so let’s assume that — and, based on this
and on these facts, the Tenth Circuit said, "We're sorry,
we just cannot, in our conviction.

You just totally failed

in your burden of proof."
QUESTION:

Well, I thought it was proved that

your clients’ lands xirere fee patent lands.
MR. HAMILTON:

You proved that.

Yes, your Honor, that was

stipulated.
QUESTION:

Oh, that was stipulated.

QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it is fee patent land without

any reservation at all except the usual reservation in that
part of the country as to irrigation ditches and things of
that [nature] constructed by the Government.
You see, the problem with Wyoming, at least the
problem to many of the Wyoming residents, is that 48 percent
of the state belongs to the Federal Government and sometimes

24
it is a little difficult for Wyoming residents, you know, to
live in. harmony with the Big Brother, so to speak, because
of the large, large, government ownership in the state.
Now — yes, sir.
QUESTION:

I am still worried about this burden

of proof.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

How are you so sure it is on the

Government to show that this is on excluded territory?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

I —

That it is not on excluded territory?

MR, HAMILTON:

Your Honor, under the terms and

conditions of the statute, the sale of alcohol and traffic
in alcohol with Indians is allowed generally.

In other

words, the 1953 statute said, because of the racial
discrimination involved by not allowing the Indian people
to drink, we hereby will allow them to drink.
QUESTION:

Providing they agree to it.

MR. HAMILTON:

Providing they agree to it within

the exterior boundaries of their reservation.
All right, sir.

So. In 1954, they agreed to it,

in this reservation.
Then,

along came 1154-C In '49 and they said --

and the Congress then said that because of the fact that
there are so many little towns on these reservations which

25
have liquor outlets now, we assume an inspection should be
made for them.
Now, there is another liquor outlet — excuse me.
QUESTION:

Well, why isn’t the burden on them to

prove the absence of the exception rather than your burden
to prove that you are within the exception?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, your Honor, so far as I am

concerned, they did not prove anything.

We proved that this

bar was located —
QUESTION:

Within the —

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Within the big boundary line.

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

— on a county right-of-way.

Yes, sir.

You did prove that.

MR. HAMILTON:

Within the huge boundary lines,

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Right,

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

They proved that.

Yes, sir.

And you say It is dead center, nobody

to prove whether it Is in the exception or not.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

So that if your burden is to show that

it is within the exception, you lose.
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, your Honor, I don’t have

any burden, it is a criminal case is what I am saying.

26
QUESTION:

Well, I know several criminal defenses

that are affirmative defenses.
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir, this does not happen to

be one of them.
QUESTION:

Well, it carved out an exception.

MR. HAMILTON:

Your Honor, I knoxf of no statute

which requires this criminal — this set out as an
affirmative criminal defense such as insanity is.
QUESTION:

And you don’t — excuse me.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your answer is that

this is an essential element of the crime?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

The exception is.

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Yes.

Except for subdivision C is there any

reference — there are many references in Indian country,
of course — but there is anywhere in the statute any
reference except In C to non-Indian communities or even to
Indian communities?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

It is the only place.

MR. HAMILTON:

It is the only place and there is

no — there are no guidelines or definitions whatsoever —•
QUESTION:

There is the definition of Indian

country, but not of Indian communities and, I gather, the

27

District

Court found that this was Indian country., all

right.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Not whether or not it was an Indian

community or not Indian community.
MR. HAMILTON:

That is correct and the thing

about it iss if the burden of proof is on the Government
to prove that this is not a non-Indian community.

There is

that double negative again.
QUESTION:

Which is to say what, to prove that it

is an Indian community?
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes.

Or it is an element of the

crime for them to prove that it is in the community because
of the exception in the law.
Now, I

will call the Court's attention to the

fact that my client was prosecuted under Section 1154,
which —
QUESTION:

Mr. Hamilton?

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

The district judge found that, as I

read the record, that the land was in Indian country.

Is

your position that there is no evidence to sustain that?
MR. HAMILTON:

No, your Honor, we admitted that

it was in Indian country because it is under 1151 — under
the definition of Section 1151.

28
QUESTION:

For a reservation.

QUESTION:

You can be in Indian country --

MR. HAMILTON:

Yess within the exterior boundaries

of the reservation, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

You can be in Indian country and not

in non-Indian country.
QUESTION:

No, non-Indian community.

MR. HAMILTON:

Well, you can be In Indian

country and be in a non-Indian community.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Like Riverton.

MR. HAMILTON:

Well, but that presents a problem

in that the southern part of Riverton is predominantly
within the Indian and Mexican people.

They live down on one

side of town.
Nov;, is part of the non-Indian community an
Indian community?
QUESTION:

Where is your guideline?
You mean, it might be an Indian

community even though —
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Within a non-Indian —

—■ 90 percent of the population were

Mexicans or whites or something else?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Sure.

At the same time, it might be a non-

Indian community although 90 percent were Indians?

29
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

That is your —

MR. HAMILTON:

Where is the guideline?

is an Indian and what is a non-Indian?
QUESTION:

And what

Who tells us that?

If 1154-C provides that the term

Indian country as used in this section does not include
fee patented lands in non-Indian communities and the
district court finds that this took place in Indian country,
he is negating the application of that exception, isn't he?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

No., sir.

Why not?

MR. HAMILTON:

Because he did not make any

finding as to the community.
QUESTION:

But he doesn't have to.

All he has to

do is to make that definition of -- this is excluded from
Indian country and if he says nonetheless this took place
in Indian country, he negates the application of the
exception.
MR. HAMILTON:
your Honor.

Well, I don’t believe he does,

I believe that he also has to make a specific

finding as to the concept of the Indian community because
of the physical location of this establishment.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't think that was implied

there despite the proof of the number* of families, the
number of Indians in a certain square mile area and the fact

30

that the bar xvas out thereby itself?
MR. HAMILTON:

Your Honor, the question asked was

as to the number of Indian children enrolled.
Now. were these in the school?

Were these

enrolled Indian children?
They didn’t know.
Is enrolling in the tribes the criteria?

No one

knows.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly the presence of Indian

families, to the extent of what, 244 out of 260 or something
like this, there must be some kind of criterion.
MR. HAMILTON:
Indian family Is.

Your Honor, we don’t know what an

Does that mean that each member of the

family is an enrolled Indian in one of

these two tribes?

I don’t know.
There are no guidelines.

There is no criteria as

to what is an Indian and what is a non-Indian.
QUESTION:

You indicated a little while ago that

eligible Indians were not permitted to be enrolled.
MR. HAMILTON:

Often this happens.

Are those

Indians or non-Indians as far as the statute is concerned?
We don’t know.
QUESTION:

If Indian country in the ’53 Act is

used in the same sense as Indian country in C of the ’49
Act, then it, by definition, does not Include a non-Indian

eonnuraity.
MR. HAMILTON:

That is correct, your Honor, but

what I am saying is, I don't know how to determine what or
what is not a non-Indian community because I don’t know
what a non-Indian is.
QUESTION:

If I understood you correctly, the

district court made no findings beyond what you had already
stipulated to, namely that you were in Indian country.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

And that your position is, he had to

go beyond that and take the second leg of subsection C and
make an explicit finding on that.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

That is right, your Honor.

To do that, he'd have to define what

is an Indian, wouldn't he?
MR. HAMILTON;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Hypothetically, would he have to say

an Indian includes not only Indians enrolled in the two
tribes, either one of the two tribes, or any person having
any degree of Indian blood?

And then count up how many

there were?
MR. HAMILTON:

Your Honor, I don’t know because

here is the thing, this probably, you know, this is the
United States Supreme Court and you have to probably make
rules for all of the Indian tribes here.

I think that this

32

is a pretty important- case and the thing about it is * maybe
we would adopt in Wyoming what is the standard of the tribe
in Wyoming?

It may be in South Dakota, you would have

whatever the standard sets up for membership in the tribes
there, all others being non-Indians.
I don't know.
QUESTION:

But could I ask you — let’s assume

that — either assume that this was Indian country or not
or that it was a non-Indian community or that it wasn't.
Let’s assume that a statute, however, expressly
made the Indian tribal liquor laws applicable to stores on
this piece of land.
Now, I suppose the federal lav; would govern, unless
it was unconstitutional, wouldn't it?
MR. HAMILTON:

No, sir, I don’t believe the

federal law governs.
QUESTION:

All right, but let’s assume it was a

federal statute that says —• assume a federal statute said,
"The Indian Tribal liquor laws shall apply to the followingdescribed piece of property"and describe this piece of
property precisely.
MR. HAMILTON:

All right.

There, of course, you

have no problem because anybody can determine what the
property looks like.
QUESTION:

Well, you have a problem because the

33
Federal Government has the pother to do that.
MR. HAMILTON:

That is true, especially when you

have a federal statute that says once you convey the
property out on fee simple without reservation or restric­
tion, that then it goes to the states, under the state
jurisdiction and that is what happened to the piece of
land that my client sits on.
QUESTION:

Under Wyoming jurisdiction, you say.

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir and if you relate 3^

stat 182 to Article 21 section 26 of the Wyoming Constitu­
tion, the two dovetail just like that.
The minute that patent is issued without reser­
vation or restirction, then you are under the jurisdiction
of the State of Wyoming.
rights of citizenship.

You enjoy all the benefits and
You enjoy all the benefits and

rights of the court system, the appellate system, the
franchise system, everything.

You have everything guaran­

teed by the United States Constitution and the Wyoming
Constitution but under Indian jurisdiction, you don't, none,
QUESTION:

Does this record shovr, or could we

spell out from this record in any way, how many of the
people in the area where your establishment is located,
this community, are enrolled members of one of these tribes?
Or are none of them?
MR. HAMILTON:

I have no idea, your Honor, you

34
would have to go through the tribal rolls of Port Washakie
and that would be a monumental job.
QUESTION:

Well, your answer Is that this record

doesn't tell that.
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir, it does not because

these are strung all over 3 million acres.
QUESTION:

And your position is that it would be

an essential part of the government burden in this case to
establish that fact.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Well, is your client's place within any

Incorporated municipality of any kind?
MR. HAMILTON:

No, sir, there is only one

incorporated municipality in — within the exterior
boundaries of the reservation and that is the City of
Riverton.
QUESTION:

Which is the most —

MR. HAMILTON:

There are other small communities

out around, but just —
QUESTION:

Are they incorporated?

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

No.

No, sir.
Incidentally, I suppose, in the

statute, community could as well mean neighborhood, whatever
that is.
QUESTION:

Don't findings of fact number 10 and

35
number 11 in the district court's judgment indicate, at
least, his understanding of the meaning of a non-Indian
community, particularly number 11?

Incorporated, non-

Indian community with recognized boundaries.
MR. HAMILTON:

Nell, your Honor, that is not what

the statute says.
QUESTION:

Well, you know what the statute says.

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir, that might be his

interpretation, but I —
QUESTION:

And you say the statute is too vague

to understand but at least the district court seemed to
understand it in these terms of an incorporated non-Indian
community with recognized boundaries.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Well, your Honor —

And I think in fact number 11 on page

34 of the Government's brief.
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, but it is

now my —
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, of the petition for writ

of certiorari.
MR. HAMILTON:

Umn hmn.

But it is my understanding

at this time that on certain reservations the Indians have
been asked to incorporate the community and they have
refused, suggesting that then they would be removed from the
jurisdiction of the United States and the —

36
QUESTION:

Well, you are talking about Indians

incorporating.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

This is non-Indian community xtfith

recognized boundaries.
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, your Honor, it is a difficult

thing to do in that area.
QUESTION:

People are —

Riverton is Incorporated, isn't it?

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, sir.

It was a land grant in

1906 and it was kind of like the Oklahoma land rush.
QUESTION:

And the finding number 10 that it is

two and a half miles from the reservation public school and
we know from the evidence introduced that a

vast majority

of the students — of the pupils of that school are Indian.
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, they are Indian, your Honor,

but I don’t know what — I don't —
QUESTION:

And you see —

MR. HAMILTON:
is still the problem.

— know what Indian means.

That

There xvasn’t any questions asked and

I couldn't find out how many of them were, in fact, enrolled
Indians.

They didn't know.
QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't say tribal members.

It says non-Indian communities.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, whatever that might be.

Well, there was a good deal of evidence

37
introduced on this, wasn't there, if it is correctly
summarized on page 8 of the Government's brief?
MR. HAMILTON:

Which brief, your Honor, there is

about —
QUESTION:
the United

The Government's brief.

The brief for

States, filed August 15th of this year.
Just the first three or four sentences.

You are

familiar with it, I am sure.
212 families, of which 170 and a half are Indian
families and the remainder non-Indian families.
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, your Honor, but the thing

about it is, Indian families is a questionable statement.
I don't know what the criteria is to determine what those
people are.

I do know —

QUESTION:

Well, the statute doesn't say anything

about tribal members.
MR. HAMILTON:

I know it doesn’t, your Honor.

It

also doesn't say what an Indian community is.
QUESTION:

Or what it is not.

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Or what it is not.

Does your attack in this respect go to

a defects of the statute, that the statute is a statute
under which no crime can be established?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Yes, it does.

38
QUESTION:

Apart from the proof.

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, your Honor.

It is a two-pronged attack.
QUESTION:

In other words —

You say they haven't made their proof

hut you say it isn't a good statute.
MR. HAMILTON:

I don’t think there is any possible

way they could make their proof under that statute, your
Honor.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, I noticed going back to

Finding 11 that Fort Washakie is not an incorporated, nonIndian community with recognized boundaries.

Are there any

incorporated non-Indian communities with recognized
boundaries?
MR. HAMILTON:

The only incorporated town with

any exterior boundaries with the reservation is Riverton.
Now, whether it is a non-Indian community or not,
I have no idea, or whether a part of it -QUESTION:

Can you have an unincorporated, non-

Indian community?
MR. HAMILTON:

I don’t know, your Honor.

as that statute is concerned, I have no idea.

So far

What I am

saying is, I think it is a questionable where, you know,
people of intelligence can differ and if so, then it is not
a proper statute for criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think a statute which might

39
otherwise be vague or nearly vague can have its faults
cured by construction?
A federal statute.
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, your Honor, if it can’t have

its faults cured by construction, then it had better be
stricken down.
QUESTION:

Well, all right, but —

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

By the Congress.

That is what the Court of Appeals did.

It struck it down.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, it did.

Why shouldn’t it have construed it if

they thought it was vague?
MR. HAMILTON:

I think they felt that the evils

here did not justify that due to the fact that they felt
that In spite of this statute that the Indians and the
TRibal Council had no jurisdiction over non-Indians.
QUESTION:

I know they had another reason besides

vagueness to give the judgment.
MR. HAMILTON:

MR. HAMILTON:

No, sir.

I was just out there last

week and he is not.
QUESTION:

Is anybody on the council an Indian?

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

At this time, no, sir.

You don’t know whether or not that is

an Indian Reservation?
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

I —

You don't know whether it is non-Indian.

MR. HAMILTON:

I would say, your Honor, that it is

not predominantly Indian people, no.
QUESTION:

But there is a —

You said you couldn’t tell whether it

was non-Indian or not but now you can.
MR. HAMILTON:

No, sir, I don’t know w' at the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME F. STATKUS, ESQ.
FOR WYOMING, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. STATKUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The State of Wyoming's interest in this particular
case — and our entrance as Amicus, is first off, that this
is fee patented land owned by a non-Indian and it is our
position that the State of Wyoming has so an exclusive
jurisdiction over this liquor license.
Secondly, that the State of Wyoming provides due
process protection in the issuance of a liquor license, due
process protection in the renewal of a liquor license, due
process protection of the revocation or suspension of a
liquor license.
Basically, our laws pertaining to the regulation
of liquor in the State of Wyoming protect not only the
licensee which, in this case is the Respondent, but also
the public and we would respectfully submit to the Court

that Indians are certainly a part of the public of the
State of Wyoming.
They are citizens of Wyoming and of the United
States that we provide, by statutory machinery, a mechanism
wherein the members of the reservation, both Arapahoe and
Shoshone, can participate in the statutory procedures
relating to the renewal or suspension or revocation of a
liquor license.
We feel that on the disestablishment or relinquish­
ment theory, we feel that the opinion of this Court in 1914
In Clairmont v. United States and also Dyck v. United States
about the same time are very important here.
We think that these two cases support the
proposition that fee patented land owned by a non-Indian
is not subject to federal control or Indian control here.
QUESTION:

So you would be making this argument,

your argument, even if there were no subsection C of 1154?
MR. STATKUS:

Yes, your Honor, that the State of

Wyoming has exclusive jurisdiction over this liquor
license.
QUESTION:

Right and that — and when you

emphasize that your state gives due process protection too
before denying or withdrawing a license, was it your impli­
cation that the tribal people do not?
MR. STATKUS:

My Implication is that it is not very

clear.

The ordinance itself is arguable.
Under the section on revocation or suspension, it

is unclear to us whether or not, for instance, 10 days’
notice has to be given in order to have a license revoked or
suspended.

It is also unclear just whether or not -» and I

don’t think the record shows us — or shows an absence of
this — that in Wyoming, when we have hearings on liquor
license subject to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act
and there is no indication in ordinance number 26 that, for
instance. Respondent Mazurie would be accorded due process
protection.
QUESTION:

But in this case he was given a hearing,

a full hearing, was he not?
MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:

Wasn’t he?

MR. STATKUS:
license since 1969.

He was, after —

Well, sir, your Honor, he had a

The property, the deeded land, had been

selling — or business had been located since ’5^.
Now, what happened was, his application to the
Tribes was for initial license, not a renex^al, and we think
that is very inequitable.
The hearing given him ~
QUESTION:

He was given a hearing.

MR. STATKUS:

He was p'iven a right to come into

the — before the Joint Tribal Council and the record shows

that he wasn’t given the right to cross-examine witnesses.
The record, as in Wyoming, it doesn’t show that the tribes
have adopted any type of rules or regulations which comport
with due process and protect the Respondent.
QUESTION:

And you gave him a hearing too, didn't

you?
MR. STATKUS:

I might clarify that.

was held before the county commissioners.

That hearing

The county

commissioners — this was renewal, your Honor

~~ they

decided not to renew the licens^ .
The case was appealed pursuant to one of our
statutes to District Court.

The District Court-» sent It back

for the reason that the County Commissioners had not
adopted rules and regulations and so Mazurie is operating
at the present.

The case Is in limbo.

QUESTION:

Was this denial of hearing point

argued before the lower court?
This is a criminal case, as I understand it.
MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it was a matter that —

Well, what you are arguing, was it

presented to the court below?
MR. STATKUS:

I don’t -- I think it was presented

but I don’t know how much —
QUESTION:

In any case, you vxeren’t there.

MR. STATKUS:

No, I wasn’t there, sir.

All I can

read is from the record.
But my point is, your Honor, that the State of
Wyoming has an interest in the regulation of liquor and we
provide a due process procedure for the issuance of an
application of license —
QUESTION:

Were you denied that under this statute

Was Wyoming denied that under the statute?
MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:

The difference between^he

Was Wyoming denied that under the

statute?
The answer is no.
MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:

Isn’t that right?

MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:

Well, it is our position that --

Yes, your Honor.

Well, what are you complaining about?

MR. STATKUS:

It is our position that the land

in question is fee patented and that the State of Wyoming
has so an exclusive jurisdiction over that liquor license.
QUESTION:

I take it your point to be that

Wyoming doesn't have to share the power to issue liquor
licenses with anyone, including the United States of America
MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And that somebody that you deem worthy

of a license in your state should have a license.
MR. STATKUS:

Yes, sir.

47
QUESTION:

And should not be deprived of it by

an Indian tribe.
MR. STATKUS:
QUESTION:
own fee patented

Yes, sir.

If he is a non-Indian operating on his

land.

MR. STATKUS:

Yes, that is our point.

I would like to say that it has been an honor for
me to present the State's position on this case to this
body.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You helped us in a

very short time.
MR. STATKUS:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Sachse, you have a few minutes:left.

Do you

have anything further?
MR. SACHSE:

Yes,

I do.

I think I have eight

minutes and I may need it, with all the things that have
been said in the last few minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.
MR. SACHSE:

To start with, the position of the

State of Wyoming is nothing less than that this Court should
reverse Seymour versus Superintendent, Mattz versus Arnett,
and repeal 18 USC 1151 and should find fact contrary to the
findings of fact of the District Court.

48
It is clear and it was stipulated in this case
that, first, it is clear that federal law does apply to nonIndian-owned land inside the boundaries of an Indian
reservation.
Mow, to get to Mr. Hamilton's argument, I have to
say this.

When I first started practicing law it was in

BAton Rouge, Louisiana and one of the first cases that I had
was a — I was defending against a motion for summary
judgment and somebody told me that the best defense against
the mouion for summary judgment is to totally confuse the
court and they then will think the problem is so complicated
that they can't grant the summary judgment.
And I think Mr. Hamilton has made a good run at
that in this case.

We have —-

QUESTION:

You have about 10 minutes now to clear

that up.
[Laughter.]

MR. SACHSE:

I think I can do it because that is

exactly what the trial in the District Court was

about and

what Mr. Hamilton is trying to do is to establish here in
20 minutes what he was unable to establish in a day or two
in the District Court.
The finding of the District Court — now,
remember, it was stipulated that these acts occurred within
the Indian reservation on fee patented land.

Everything was

49
stipulated except the question about the non-Indian
community and when the ~~
QUESTION:

If it was a non-Indian community, it

wasn’t Indian country.
MR, SACHSE:

If it was a non-Indian community, it

was an exception under statute.

It was not Indian country

as defined by 18 USC 1154.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

I see.

Right.

And the court held in finding

number 21 that the defendant, "In dispensing intoxicants
from the Blue Bull absent a license from the tribe, violated
Section 1154."
Now, they didn’t say, violated Section 1151, which
is the broad definition of Indian country, but 1154,
which has the exception in it about non-Indian communities
and I want to make another point straight.
QUESTION:

I —

The only findings I recall was that it

was not incorporated.
MR. SACHSE:

His only specific finding as to the

community was that, in his first list of findings, which
was that Port Washakie was not an incorporated, non-Indian
community.

But then his final finding is that the defendant

violated 18 USC 1154.
But I want to make a point about burden of proof •—
QUESTION:

That might have been on the premise

50
that he assumed that to be a non-Indian community, it had to
be incorporated.
QUESTION:

It might have been, if you haven’t

read the testimony that was before the District Court.

But

before the District Court had solid testimony before it and
by the way, the question about who was enrolled and who was
not enrolled was fully brought out in the District Court and
then the testimony as to the school children, it was
testified that they were enrolled members of the tribe and
the testimony as to the Indian population, it was discussed
who was enrolled, who was not enrolled and the figures stand
up one way or the other.
But the point that I am trying to make here is
that the District Court only had one thing to decide and
that was whether this occurred in a non-Indian community
and there was simply no evidence that however you wanted
to stretch, the idea of non-Indian community

that this

occurred in a non-Indian community and because of that, the
Court held tha.t 1154 was satisfied.
But the point I was making a minute ago was that
we don't urge a burden of proof on the defendant here.
There was solid testimony, solid evidence and a
finding in this case that this did not occur in a nonIndian community and a lot of the confusion in the District
Court was Mr. Hamilton’s continued attempt there, as

he

finally got around to doing here, to try to say that the
Government had to prove that it occurred in an incorporated
Indian community.

But that is not what the statute says.

We know that the District Court —

what his standard was.

MR. SACHSE:

I think what we know is, under a

broad or a narrow standard, this was not an Indian community
and that under — excuse me, a non-Indian community and the
question was whether it was a non-Indian community and
applying the National Dairy approach to this case, this
statute is clear enough and I think in operation it has
been clear* enough that this statute has been there since
19^9 and there has been no attempt to enforce it in, say,
Riverton.
