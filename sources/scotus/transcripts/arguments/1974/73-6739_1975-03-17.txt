MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj

We will hear argument

Mr. Hagopian, I think you may proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. HAGOPX&i?
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HAGOP1AN:
Che Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, ana <u\y if ploesn

This case involves an appeal from the Municipal

Court in Boston.

In Massachusetts we have what is cnnucniv

known as a two-tier trial de novo system.

There is a set of

lower courts that is comprised-.of the district courts and the
municipal court of Boston, and there is a second, tisr in the
de novo procedure which is basically the. superior court.
The superior court and the district courts? or the
loser courts have concurrent jurisdiction over most crimes.
One limitation is that -the first tier, or the lowr;?r courts,
can only have jurisdiction over crimes which at© pueiababia up
to five years in. the State prison.

There are a few exce;

chat go up to ten years — burglary, breaking and entering
at nighttimej

■fchs district courts have jurisdiction.

have the option there of pleading not guilty and going to trial
or you have the option of pleading guilty.

If you are

4
convicted after you plead not guilty? you have a supposedly
unqualified and unfettered right tor a trial de novo in the
second tier of the Massachusetts procedure.

If you plead

guilty? you cannot get a trial de novo in the second tier.

'.Von

nay appeal the sentence itself, that is? if you are imprisoned,
idle length of confinement, tut there is no trial in the second
tier on the merits of the controversy.
There is no procedure in the Massachusetts two-tier
procedure for any appellate review of a decision in the lower
court or the lower tier.

There are a number of collateral

remedies that are available, that is, if you go to trial in
the district court and you are convicted aid imprisoned, you
nay bring a writ of habeas corpus.

There .Is another writ

called a. writ of error, which is unlike the writ of error that
used to come to this Court many years ago and is what is
normally known.

That writ of error is not available for any

collateral relief.

It's an independent and distinct, proceeding;

The third possibility is to petition the Supreme
Judicial Court for extraordinary relief under their supervisory
powers.
Now, in this particular case the appellant, Steven
Costarelli

requested a jury trial in the first instance.

He

was charged with a criian fox which he could have received two
years in prison and a fine.

The trial judge denied that motion

notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Costare Hi had asserted his

specific constitutional rights and the right to a speedy

rial

which he interpreted that to mean a speedy trial by jury c 1
a speedy trial that comports with constitutional standards,
and also his right under the double jeopardy provisions,
From the denial of -chat motion ho filed an appeal in
tills case.

In this case the Court has set down the issue of

X submit to you, your Honors# that this Court has

jurisdiction over an appeal from the Boston Municipal Court
because that court is the highest State court within the meaning
of those words in section 1257.

There is no means of reversing errors that want on

down in the lower court.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Hagopian# what if your client hid

been initially tried in the district court on the*same charge
and was acquitted and then he was tried again in the district
court and found guilty and you. wanted to raise the claim of
double jeopardy.

Gould you raise that, in the superior court

on an appeal from that second verdict?
MR. HAGOPIAN?

Yes.

Certainly an issue —

?
jeopardy in the form of a motion in bar*

I don’t believe he

can collaterally attack what went. down1;, in the district courtt.
If the denial bf a jury trial is a purely reversible error,
it may be moot-ad by the fact that if 'die judge denies this
motion in bar in the superior court and he is granted a jury
trial and he’s convicted there, then he has had a jury trial
and the issue may be moot* that is, if you consider the fact
that a denial cf a jury trial is a purely reversible error,
forgetting the doubles jeopardy claim or the spaedy trial claim,
if it is clearly a reversible error, it’s been cured by the
fact that he has had a jury trial,
QUESTIONs

But you could have, X suppose, under those

circumstances, after making your point in the superior court
claiming the right to a jury trial, they rule against you,
at least brought it here from the superior court on the ruling

on that motion rather than just from the district court,
MR. EAGOPI&N:

Yes, that’s quite correct.

I have

that issue now before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court,
and that case is currently being litigated there.

But X

don’t think that that cuts away from this Court’s jurisdiction.

the Municipal Court

He does not have to suffer a second 'trial before

can get appellate review in this Court,

That, is the foundation

on which this Court's jurisdiction is predicated under section

1257.
QUESTION:

If your;.- answer to my question is right,

he wouldn't have had to suffer a second trial, he could have
gotten a ruling, oa his motion in the superior court and before
he ever went to trial in the superior court he could have
brought it here.
ICR. HAGOPI&Sl:

No, that's not correct, X don’t believe

that's correct, because then it would not be a judgment from
which an appeal could be taken.

If it was simply a denial

of a motion, he would have had to have gone through the trial
in the superior court.

He can’t appeal from. the. denial of a

motion in the superior court, he can only appeal under
tout.ion 1257 .ilxora a denial of a judgment, that is a final
judgment from a superior court.

That would be piecemeal

adjudication of the trial or the proceedings in the superior
court, and I don't believe that jurisdiction would apply under
that procedure.
QUESTItbs

What you are saying, than, iu this:

Although he can appeal from the final judgment of a district
court, had he taken the State proceedings a step further, gone
into the superior court and made his motion, he couldn't appeal

from that»
Unless he completed the trial m

superior court.

Then he would have to go to the Massachusetts

Supreme. Judicial Court because the superior court is not
the highest state court within the meaning of those, words.

H©

would have had to have gone all the way up through the ladder,
through the appeals court in Massachusetts and the Massachusett
Supreme Judicial Court.

And let me just state for the record,

and perhaps that’s not too clear, it should be clear in the
record, Mr. Costarelli has lodged an. appeal for trial do. novo

in the superior court.

That was done under compulsion, and I

don't, believe ho should have, been forced to elect his remedies
at that stage of the proceedings.
QUESTION?

Is that pending now?

MR. H&GOPIAN: Yes, it in, and the Chief Justice of
the superior court has stayed those proceedings pending the
disposition of this case.

.MR. HhGOPIANs

Wall, the only record that technically

goes up, a complaint is filed in the district court, he’s
found guilty, that record and the disposition that goes on in
the district court goes up to the superior court.

Other than

that there is no record in the district court, and you cannot
collaterally attack anything that went on in the district court

QUESTION;

What goes up to the Supreme Judicial

Court on your motion for extraordinary relief?
MR, KAGQPXMU

If ha brings a motion for extraordinar

relief in the Supreme Judicial Court from proceedings in the
district court, nothing goes up.

The record does not .go up*

He must file a complaint, just like he would initiate in a
civil proceedings.

The complaint is just like a complaint in

Yes.

MR. HAGQPI&N:

The superior court?

The superior court in Massachusetts —

Suppose a motion is made that the superior

court does not have a right to try me because the court is
without jurisdiction.
MR. HAGOPXAN:

Well, I don't think that the fact

that he did not have a jury trial in the district court
affects the jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I didn't say one word about a jury trial.

Honor, no.

point, that this- court is without jurisdiction because the
judge is 60 years old and everybody on the jury is dead; that
that can* t be appealed?

QUESTION;

At this time 1 will take your word for it,

at this time.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION;

I believe that's correct, your Honor.

Of course, you would bs in the superior

court only because you ns a defendant had invoked its juris­
diction.

It would be kind of an odd thing to go in -there and

invoke its jurisdiction and then file a motion saying it doesn't
have jurisdiction
QUESTION s

Did you invoke its jurisdiction there?

MR. HAGOPXhH:
QUESTION;

X thought you said they made you file it.

MR, HAGOPIAN:

Well, yes, your Honor, I —

Pardon, your Honor?

MR. HAGOPIAN:

Ho, your Honor, I don't believe X

When Costarelli was convicted in the district court

we appealed, 1 appealed for him, arid he has a pending trial
de novo in the superior court»

The proceedings .in the superior

court have been stayed by order of the Chief Justice of the
superior court pending the resolution of this case in this
Court.

And I don't believe that because Hr. Costare.:,hi hao

elected to go forward with that, ha still has the right to
coma to tills' Court alleging that that is the highest Star ?.
court, the district court in Massachusetts.

The fact that he

elected a trial da novo cannot constitute a waiver of

’his

Federal rights under section 125?»

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question.

Is there any

way in the Massachusetts system whereby Hr. Cosfcaralli could
have bypassed the district court?
MR. HAGOPZANs

No, there is not, your Honor,

He may

not even waive a trial like in Colton v. Kentucky , there is
language in this Court, and I believe it's the procedure in
Co3.ten where you can circumnavigate a trial. You must stand
trial, and X believe my brother concedes this, there is .no
means of waiving a -trial in the distret court in Mast* >chusefcts.
You must stand trial.

And if you remain silent, the court

convicts you, you stand guilty, and the burden is Uf
in superior court.

If you default, if you do not show up in

she superior court, judgment will be entered in the superior
court under the Massachusetts statute, the sentence that warimposed in idle district court will he. impeded upon you.

MR. HAGOPXAJJ:

QUESTION:

So you may not have to plead guilty to

get there, but you could just default and get there, justhave judgment entered, against you.
MR. HAG-OP JAHs

You mean in the district court in

Massachusetts?
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. H&GOPIANs

Just default.
You can't default? the judgment -/’.ill

not be entered by default in a criminal proceedings in
Massachusetts.
QUEJ3TIGK;

What did you tell me?

I thought I under-

stood you to say that if you defaulted in the district court
judgment would be entered against you.
MR. HAGCPIAN;
:: didn't say that.

Ho, X am sorry,, your Honor, X think

What I meant was that in the superior court

upon trial de novo, if you default there the judgment of the
district court where you had been, found guilty will now -be
imposed.

What if you stand mute in the district

court or what if you just don't show up, you say, "I'm not

MR. HAGOPIAN:

point was brought up in Callan v. Wilson# and Justice Harlan#
the first Justice Harlan of this Court said that there is a

QUESTION;

There is another side of the coin and

that is if you stand mute and hear.the State’s- evidence, you
know what the State’s case is.
MR. HA.GOPIM'J:

-and the difficulty with that is that

...the Massachusetts system attaches collateral cor.taquences to that
judgment.

It's not totally vacated. Yeur driver’s license

may be yanked.

If you are on probation,- you will automatically

be sent to jail, and those collateral consequent:

very

severe and this Court has affirmed those collateral consequences
in a case last terra.
QUESTION;

I thought you just admitted to ire. Justice

vflhite that you could nullify that entire effect.
MR. liKaOPIAN:

You can’t nullify the collateral

consequences r you see, because of the fact in the Massachusetts
procedure, the statutes empower the registrar, say, to yank
your motor vehicle license, entirely separate.
part of the judgment of the district, court.

That's not

They independently

give powers to attach to these collateral consequences.

They

are not vacated by the district court judgment and they are
imposed.

And 1 raised that issue in th.fi three-’judge court last

yisar, in the Federal district court, and they refused to declare
that that, procedure was being putting a price on what is supposed

17
to be hi3 unfettered sight of appeal, wt*. this Court, affirotad
that decision.

So I assume that

When does the judgment of the district

court become annulled?

Suppose you are found Innocent in the

superior court?
MR. H&OQPXMfs
QUESTION;

That’s the end.

Then what happens to you?

MR. H&GOPIAN;

The government hasn't — there's

no more trial.
QUESTION:

I knew, no more trial- but nothing

happens to —- nobody reverses anything.
iV

MR. HAGOPIANs
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

Now, wait a minute,- is this being found

innocent in the district court or —
QUESTIONs

No, no.

QUESTION;

1 think Mr, Justice White asked ycu suppose

you were found innocent in the superior court.

MR. KAGOPXAN:

Then, yes, then you are declared

innocent and then the registrar has to give you your license
back.

But you see, it’s that intervening time —
QUESTION;

I understand.

MR. RAGOPXANs

— between the district court and

the superior court that is the nub of the matter.
QUESTION;
you finish the

You say the judgment stays in effect until

ME. HAGOPXAN:

fell, let :• a say this;

collateral

consequences are not part cf the judgment,there are a separate
statutes that are involved.

The judgment is technically vacated,

hut if you default in the superior court, the superior court
judge has the power to pass sentence on you when you are not
■wen there in default.

Ha passes the sentence of the district,

court«
QUESTION:

It’s very much like an appeal,

MR. HASOPXhN:

It is.

it exactly is.

It is an

appeal f and it is an appeal like in Colter?, v. Kentucky is an
appeal, and that, of course, goes to the nub of the matter,
,Sad let ma just say this on the issue of Colton.

In Colter

it wasn't transmitted up to the superior court, it’s a real
true da novo system here.

In the Massachusetts system the

judge and jury, everybody, knows where these cases came from
and they know that the man has been convicted.

In addition

to that, of course, the critical issue in Colten was that
Colten was entitled to a trial by jury in the first instance.
lot ivi just say briefly on the merits of this case,
I think that the large issue, the broad issue in this cas
not whether the rule in Callan v, Wilson
the State should be bound.

is incorporat'd and

I think that the real broad issue

in this c&se in whether the States have a right to deny a.
parson a specific procedural constitutional right, whether
it's a right to counsel or whether it’s a right to an impartial

judge or it's the right to a trial by jury. X don’t believe
it*s any answer for the State to say, well,
a trial de novo.

r& will give you

T. think the man is

in the first instance, right to counsel, right to trial by
jury, right to an impartial judge.

And it* a no answer on

the part of Massachusetts of the other States to simply ray
we will give these fco you after we have subjected you avd
you are forced with the stigma of a conviction of guilty.
Now, X think.trial de novo has a legitimate place
in the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in
the State system, and I am not asking this Court to fear a trial
de novo.

Ml I am asking them to do is to say that

Massachusetts must do what Rhode Island has to do, that when
the defendant comes before the district court, if he; doesn't
want to proceed at that stage of the proceedings, he should
have a right to circumnavigate that trial and go right he the
superior court or the State has to give me trial by jury in
the first instance.
for.
down.

Stoat’s the only thing that I am asking

I’m not asking to lake the whole5, trial de novo system
That, of course, would have some serious consequences.

If the State wants to give somebody a trial de novo as an
equivalent to an appellate remedy, I think that’s fine.

There

is nothing wrong with that, as the procedure in Col ten .■

But

1 do object to the fact that the State of iiissachuse11s can
deny somebody his specific Sixth Amendment constitutional

'i 0

right, and I think that that% s what the heart of tAia.53 case 3.s
all about.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time.
QUESTION:

You don.*t suggest, X take it, that •—

X will put an objective question.

If he is tried in this

first tribunal with a jury, found guilty, takes an appeal, in
quotation marks, but gets a trial &© novo, any problems about
that in. terms of double jeopardy?

MR, KAGOPXAN:

Mo, your Honor.

That5s the procedure

in Rhode Island now and was the procedure in Kentucky in the
Col ten ease.

You have a right to a trial by jury.

7. don't

object to this.
The double jeopardy issue is that X don’t think a
person should have to suffer two trials to get what he is
entitled to at least once, and this Court just, recently, and
I guess it. was Wilson vUnited States a few weeks ago,- held
that the real underlying prohibitions of the double jeopardy
clause is that the multiple trials, the trial process itself
isn’t brad, but that may result as a manifest necessity,
obviously all trials can’t be perfect»
QUESTIONS

But if she State did give the jury trial

in the first instance, all they-would need to do is have. a
review on the. record if they provided any review at all.

Is

that not so?
MR. HAQQPONs

That’s correct.

I’m not arguing that

they have to provide a review at aAi»

'MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. BURGER:

Mr. Mi

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MILLS ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. MILLS:
the Court:

Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please

I believe that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has asked

the single critical question with respect to the issue of
jurisdiction.

However, by way of introductory overview. I

would like to suggest to this Court that Massachusetts has
presented a brief with five parts, and. hopefully we will argue
today in five parts.
Those parts are, first, in accordance with rule 16,
the question of jurisdiction.

And by way of introduction we;

suggest that this Court does not have jurisdiction because
this appeal fails of the prerequisite statutory 3 uris die t ioiict 3.
prerequisites in section 1257.
Our second point will be that the Massachusetts
jury procedure as it currently exists is a. system: whicia rs
basic and fundamental and is justifiable as adequate unde.?.,
the Fourteenth Amendment standards that have been enunciate-a
by this Court.
Our third position as presented ip the brief will
ba that the Massachusetts jury system as it presently is in
practice is a procedure and system which provides for the
function and purpose of jury trial in America, as has been

enunciated in standards and decisions by this Court.
Our fourth position will be that the right to a
speedy trial is not properly in issue before this Court- and
our final position will be that double jeopardy and the claim
of a violation of double jeopardy in this case is controlled
by this Court's decision in Colton v.

Kentucky.

Firste with respect to the issue of jurisdiction?
Massachusetts suggests that the prerequisites of section 1237
have not been satisfied.
appeal to this Court
prerequisites.

We suggest that for purposes of an

pursuant to 1257» there are three

The judgment of the State court must be final?

the judgment of the State court must be of the highest court in
which a decision could be had? and for purposes of appeal under
subsection [2) of section 1257? the constitutionality of a
State statute must have been drawn in question with a
determination in favor of its validity.

And Massachusetts

suggests that each of these statutory prerequisites are missing
in tills ease.
With respect to finality» this Court has stated that
no self-enforcing formula can be defined as to determine when
a Stat?

judgment can be final.

And as early as 1869 in the case

of Thompson,v. bean» this Court implicitly rejected a mechanical
application of a formula of finality speaking rather in terms
of the degree of finality essential to appeal.

MR. MILLS:

As far as I know, your Honor.

When the

appeal is claimed, it transfers the whole case for redetermina­
tion completely divorced from the earlier proceeding.
QUESTION:

And what of the collateral consequences

your friend was discussing?
MR. MILLS:

The collateral consequences, your Honor,

£ suggest, this point has also been raised in the amicus
brief of the Massachusetts Defenders Committee.

They suggest,

as does the appellant, that this Court should enter an order
or take some action suggesting that the Massachusetts
defendant at the district court level should be able to waive
a trial and proceed directly to a jury because of the
collateral ancillary inconveniences of a district court
adjudication of guilt.

However, each of these positions, the

position of the amicus and the position of the appellant, I
suggest are based upon an independent due process question
with respect fcc driver's licenses.
that is before this Court.

That is not the question

I believe it’s an important

question, but not a question that goes to whether or not this
particular judgment is final.
We suggest that the redetermination of the question ’
of guilt or innocence which is available in the superior court

explicitly contraindicates that fixe earlier Boston Municipal

Court decision determined. this mattsr.

we suggest that the Boston Municipal Court judgment is not
final.

QUESTION:

What are the circumstances in which the

Is it a certiorari jurisdiction or a certiorari,

MR. MILLS:

There is a procedural vehicle which is

General Laws chapter 211# section 3, under which this particular
question has reached the highest Massachusetts court twice#
only in each instance# although the court did consider the
issue, it said that it was doing so for a matter of convenience
and that the particular vehicle had been improperly used.

So

I would suggest that there is no direct route from the Boston
Municipal Court to the Supreme Judicial Court.

It requires

that the intermediate courts# the superior court and the
Massachusetts Appeals Court be utilized.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:

What procedure was followed in Uhitaarsh?

determination of the constitutional issue.
QUESTION:

Isn't Whitmansh the critical case hare?

It has to be in your posture# doesn’t it?

MR. MILLS:

No, your Honor, not with respect to an

argument on this Court's jurisdiction under section 1257.
QUESTION:

of course, it’s here, it's before us,

Whitmarsh is.
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Costare ill is before this court.
Well, Whitmansh is, too.

There’s a

petition for certiorari hare that hasn’t been acted on.
MR. MILLS:

oh, correct.

Excuse me, your Honor.

I would suggest, however, that the question of
finality is not to be determined simply on that basis.

The

question of finality, we suggest, under the decisions of

;

this Court, means that the appellate review .be pursued in
this particular case, and it was not pursued in this particular
case.
QUESTION:

Let me repeat my first question.

Are you

not relying on what you call your Supreme Judicial Court did
in Whitparsh tc buttress your posture here?

Without its

opinion in Whitmarsh wouldn't you be in a much weaker posture?
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

With respect to jurisdiction?
With respect to Mr. Costarelli*s case in

j uri sd i c tion, yes..
MR. MILLS:

I don't believe so, your Honor.

The

Boston Municipal Court', we suggest, for purposes of jurisdiction,
is not the highest court in Massachusetts in which a decision
could be had on this question, and I don't think that I need

go on at length.

I have suggested that the superior court,

could make a determi .

gher court.

That

Massachusetts Appeals Court was evallabis to. this appellant,
as a matter of right; that is a still higher court.

And that

further and substituted hearings might, have been available
before the Supreme Judicial Court which is a still higher red
our highest court in Massachusetts.

We recognize that the

highest court in which a decision could be had need not be
the highest appellate court in the State.

Nonetheless, ra

suggest -that this question could have reached the Supreme
Judicial Court/ and because that is the highest court In which
a decision could be had, this particular judgment is not.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist raised the question as to
whether or not the determination of the Boston Municipal Court
could be reviewed in another court upon the record made in the
district court.

I think that that is a critical question.

I

think that the answer is critical to each side in this
particular case.

In Largent v. Texas, which is cited, I'm

sure, I know, in each of the briefs,

this Court seems to have

established a rule that if the conviction in the lower court
is not examinable in a higher court on the record made in the
lower court, than the question has been finally determined
fox' purposes of section 1257.

If that is the rule that bar

beex:. established by this Court, we suggest that mechanically
the Boston Municipal Court judgment cannot be reviewed in

another Massachusetts court cq ths r;;corcl made is. the
Massachusetts court.

However, an application of that rule

we have suggested would not really do justice to the substance
of the fact and to the point .in this case fco which tiers seeraa
to be no contest whatsoever»

The matter of guilt or innocence,

and the matter of whether or not the district court judge was
correct in denying a motion for a new trial, each of those two
determinations made by the lower court are subject, to
redetermination.

We suggest, accordingly, that there has

been not a determination, a final determination, sufficient
for purposes of section 1257.
QUESTION:

Wasn’t it in Largent, too,. though?

Are you asking us to overrule Largent?MR. MILLS:

Me.

I don't fully under-—

To the

extent that I read .Largent, it seems to be opposite to the
position that I argued to you today.

Yes, your Honor,

I am not convinced that it is.

Seems

However, I am suggest­

ing that in this Court the substance of the determination made
by that lower court has not been fully determined, and under the.
explicit langueige of the statute there has been no final deter­
mination .
QUESTION%

Well, it sounds to me as if what you are

contending for might leave open the possibility that if a
defendant could get review on writ

of prohibition or writ,

of mandamus, the kind where you file an original complaint.

this Court’s decision in Dimean v. Louisiana which says that
State criminal defendants be afforded the right to a trial by
jury.

We say that it adequately corap lies with this

Fourteenth Amendment requirement and at the outset v?e suggested,
that the Court in Duncan v. Louisiana did not incorporate
Callan v. Wilson, and if this Court did incorporate Callan v.

constitutional history of the original States and we find that
the de novo system existed in Massachusetts dating from 1647in New Hampshire from. 1679, from Vermont, Connecticut., Rhoda
Island and Maine from the early 1700's.

We suggest that -tills

ucmstitr.tional colonial analysis in the •brief is appropriate
in view of the criteria that vara-used by this Court in
Duncan v. Louisiana f the Willi axis case

t

the

Apodaca case,

and the other recent cases in which this Court has. considered
the jury trial right with respect to State procedures,

We

have examined contemporary practices among the Slates aa this
Court did in Duncan v, Louisianaf and the results are cortainad
in the brief.

We have suggested that the Massachusetts jury

procedure fulfills the function and purpose of jury.

That is

the interpositi.on of the common- sense judgment of a group of
laymen between an accuser and his accused.

In this regard we

would respectfully direct the Court's attention to the brief
of the amicus filed by the Massachusetts Defendants Committee
which

1

think says better than the appellee has said in its

orief that far from being oppressive findeed

the particular

Massachusetts jury procedure system in question here may even
contraindicate inconvenience let alone governmental oppression.
Finally

e

we have suggested that the speedy trial right

is not in issue in this case as there is no measurable period
of delay by which this Court can assess a delay in the terms
of the criteria of Barker v. Wingo, and we have suggested that
the Massachusetts procedure is not violative of doable jeopardy
in view of this Court’s decision in Col ten v<- Kentucky.

That’s correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Very well.

MR. HAGOPIAN:

One thing I would like to mention in

reply to Mr. Justice White, there is a procedure in Massachusetts
called submitting to a finding of fact in the lower court which
is equivalent to what you mentioned, you simply remain silent.
The government doesn't have to complete, put all the evidence
and follow the rules of evidence,that is, hearsay and things
like that go in, that's an informal procedure.

You still are

judged guilty, but there is no way of circumnavigating that,
and the sentence is passed upon you.
QUESTION:

Is there a way that you could raise in

the superior court the question that — the Federal question
■•hat you want us to adjudicate?

Now, is there some way that you can presept

to the superior court and have ruled on the issue you want us
to rule on?
MR. IIAGOPIAN:

Other than a motion to dismiss on the

grounds of double jeopardy, the answer is no, there is no
possible way of reviewing any error.
Let me give you an —
QUESTION:

Now, let’s assume you get convicted after

a jury trial in the superior court.

Can you present the

question you want us to adjudicate here by taking it to the
higher courts in Massachusetts just like you are presenting if
to us?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

The only grounds you could raise Lt to

the higher court in Massachusetts is that the trial judge in

the superior court: suada c. fair.take whon he ccc.iied : v„ metior.. to
dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy,,
QUESTIONS- Would they entertain that motion on the
merits?
MR. H&GOPXAN:

Certainly.

But- if the. denial of a

trial by jury in the first Instance is clearly a reversible
error and not double jeopardy, then.the claia that he is
denied a trial by jury in the first instance; is automatically
mooted by the fact that he-has had a trial by jury. That’s
where the difficulty is.
QUESTION?

Well, if it’s mooted in the Massachusetts

courts/why isn’t it mooted here?

If it’s not mooted here,

why is it mooted in the Massachusetts courts?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well, it’s not mooted hare because

of the fact that in Costarelli’s case, the Chief Justice of
the superior court has stayed the trial de novo.

Ha stayed

those proceedings.
QUESTION?

But you say if he hadn’t stayed them„

then you would have no case here.
MR. HAGOPIUNs
QUESTION!

Absolutely.

I know, but let’s assume the

answer to

you in the Massachusetts courts would be just what you cay
they are.

Nevertheless, there is a way — that may is a wrong

answer, constitutionally it may be wrong.

But nevertheless

you can present the issue to those courts and you can have

your motion ruled on.

MR. HAGOPIAN s

Because of the fact that that is a

collateral means of reviewing that judgment, according to
Massachusetts.

It’s a collateral means.

A man should not

have to suffer a second trial to review the- error that is made
in the district court, and that is the nub of section 1257.
That's haygent v. Tcs~as.

Court is pending —•
QUESTIONS

There was no trial da novo procedure

That was wholly Federal habeas and they

said Federal habeas was not available to raise the constitutionsi

That stay be so, but the court didn't

They said there weren't any.

MR. HAGOPIAN;

And I believe this Court mentioned

in its opinion, it said, and I quote to your Honor, it soys
that the fact that there vrera collateral remedies opes, does
not affect this Court's jurisdiction, and that is the key —

QUESTION:

It doesn’t affect it over the Federal

question which the collateral remedies didn’t let him raise»

MR. IIAGOPIAN:

But this Court stated that since the

possibility that the appellant might obtain relief by a
subsequent anci distinct proceedings and one net. in the nature'
of a review of the pending charge in the same or a different
court of the State does not affect the finality of an existing
judgment

or the fact that this judgment was obtained in the

highest State court available to the appellant.

I read that

language as simply saying that because a man may collaterally
attack a judgment in the district court or the lower court in
Massachusetts is irrelevant to this Court's jurisdiction under

1257

.
QUESTION:

In eargent the State proceeding loft the

judgment final and in effect.

MS. HAGOPl&Nx

I submit to you that is.an entirely

different matter, the fact that a man should not have to go
through a second trial, a second trial, that does not review
the record of the first court.
QUESTIONi

Well, there is a certain irony in year-

jurisdictional basis, but the better off you are on the
constitutional merits.

And the same is true in reverse of

MR, IIAGOPIAN:

Yes.
