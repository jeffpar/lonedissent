PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next In No. 74-415, Rondeau versus Mosinee Paper Corporation.
Mr. Beckwith, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. BECKWITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BECKWITH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may It please

the Court:
This case presents the question of what is the
appropriate judgment to enter at this time for the violation
of — for a violation of the Williams Act 'which occurred
In the spring and summer of 1971.
The District Court, Western District of Wisconsin,
Judge Doyle, determined in February of 1973, that the
appropriate Judgment was to dismiss the complaint.
This \*as pursuant to a motion for summary judgment.
The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in July
of 1974, directing the District Court to enter an order
sterilizing 3 percent of the stock of the Defendant,
Mr. Rondeau, for a period of five years and permanently
enjoining Mr. Rondeau from further violations.
The Williams Act, as you know, amended the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In essence it provides

that a shareholder who acquires more than 5 percent of the

Zl

shares of a covered company — and that figure, incidentally,
was 10 percent until December 31, 1970s approximately six
months before the violation — a shareholder who acquires
more than 5 percent is required to file a schedule 13D which
3ets forth his identity, sources of financing, purpose and
other matters.
It is a notice statute.

It is designed to give

management and other shareholders a notice of accumulation
of stock.

It sets the rules of contest for tender offers

and pretender offer conduct.
QUESTION:

The 13D has to be filed with the

company and with the Exchange.
MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

And with the Commission.

MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And where else, if anywhere?

MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That is all.

And how do shareholders readily and

promptly get knowledge of this?
i'iR. BECKWITH:

Usually through information

from

management, if It is filed as a pretender offer matter.
It can come through publicity generally, if it is picked
up — the filing is picked up.
QUESTION:

Neither the Commission nor the Exchange

normally makes any efforts to disseminate the information

5
to the shareholders.
MR. BECKWITH:

That Is correct, but, of course,

the Exchange and the Commission do have rules regarding
what management must publicise and this might be considered
such relevant information that management might be required
to publicise it, in certain circumstances.
QUESTION:

And it would often be deemed to be In

management's interest to publicise it, too.
MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

It might be.

Yes.

MR. BECKWITH:

The District Court concluded that

there was no issue of material fact as to the propositions
which it Included in its opinion under the heading of facts.
That matter was strenuously contested on appeal,
ac Judge cell's dissent indicates, but both the majority in
the Court of Appeals and the disserit, Judge Pell, agreed
YJith Judge Doyle that summary judgment was appropriate and
that the facts were not — the operative facts were not in
material dispute.
QUESTION:
facts Is

So that Judge Doyle's statement of

basically not findings of fact but statements of

fact that were undisputed.
MR. BECKWITH:
way he states it.

That is my position and that is the

That matter has been raised again here

by Respondents, we think improperly be «use no cross-

6
petition for certiorari was filed.
The facts, as stated by Judge Doyle, are essentially
these.

Mosinee is a company in central Wisconsin engaged

in the manufacture of pulp and paper.

It is located in the

small community of Mosinee near Wausau.
Mr. Rondeau is a business man in Mosinee.

His

business is in cold storage and cheese manufacture.

Ke

operates several companies, some of which bear hia name and
all of which are clearly identified with him In those
smaller communities.
He began to purchase Mosinee stock in April of
1971 because he thought it to be a good investment.
May 17, his holdings had exceeded 5 percent.

By

He had over

*10,000 shares and *10,309 shares were 5 percent.
Accordingly, he was allowed to file a Schedule 13D
on May 27, 1971.

He did not do so and that is not contested,

the fact of violation.

It was not until the chairman of the board of
Mosinee, a Mr. Forester, wrote to Mr. Rondeau on July 30
and called to his attention in the letter that he might
have problems, he, Rondeau, might have problems under the
Securities Act, that Mr. Rondeau for the first time
consulted legal counsel and was advised that he, indeed,
did have problems under the Act arid that he should discon­
tinue his purchases and accumulate the information to file

7
a schedule 13-D which the District Court found that he
promptly did.

It was filed on August 25, 1971.

This

action was filed September 2, 1971*
That is an Important fact.

It is quite clear, x*e

submit, that Fir. Rondeau did not file in response to this
action, nor was the purpose, we believe, of the suit, to
force Mr. Rondeau to file.
Rather, it wa3 to neutralize him or to tie him up.
In short, it was not to enforce the Act, but it
was to use the Act to the advantage of the Company.
Now, that is indicated because the customary
conduct in cases of this nature is for the company to file
a motion for preliminary injunction, frequently, to seek a

GRO.
The motion for preliminary injunction here was
not filed with the complaint, but was filed some weeks
later and then was withdrawn, in itself indicating that the
company was apparently not sustaining irreparable injury
which required a preliminary injunction.
QUESTION:

Wasn’t there an amended schedule?

ICR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, there was.

After the institution of the lawsuit.

MR. BECKWITH:

Yes,

his schedule_

8
It does not materially change the pertinent
information in the schedule. In the attempt to get all of
this lined up in August, the allocation between various
purchasers, various defendants, was slightly misstated.
The total number of shares was not misstated, but
the allocation was slightly misstated.
QUESTION:

That is, among himself and his various

corporations.
MR. BECKWITH:

Right.

And the question of

financing, he was — had some difficulty in tracing whether
he had used loans of various kinds for purchases and that
was clarified in the subsequent schedule and the statement
of purpose was amplified but not significantly changed in
the

amendment that was filed.
The Amendment was perhaps filed out of an abundance

of caution.

We do not contend one way or the other whether

it was filed in response to the
QUESTION:

lawsuit.

Well, didn't the amendment for the fir3t

time indicate that its purpose might be the acquisition of
control of the company?
MR. BECKWITH:

No.

The original schedule indicated

that he — one of his purposes might be to tender for stock,
to seek control and the amendment simply amplified that,
with simply some additional language.
QUESTION:

At the time of these purchases, the

9
chairman of Mosinee was a man by the name of Forester, a
lawyer who did not practice but

who, with his company,

managed trusts.
Mr. Forester, his family and the trusts that he
managed were the largest shareholders in common as a group
of Mosinee.
The President was Mr, Scholtens.

They became

informed of Mr. Rondeau’s purchases very early and both of
them monitored hi3 purchases by keeping tabulations.
Mr. Scholtens called Mr. Rondeau when his purchases
reached the level of approximately 18,000 shares.
Mr. Rondeau’s purchases were open and notorious,
Most of the shares were purchased in his own name, some

,

34,000.

m

No shares were purchased in straight name.
Over 40,000 shares were purchased in his own name

or in the names of companies bearing his name.
There 3eems to be no dispute that, at least by
June or July, it was well-known to Mr. Scholtens and
hr. Forester that Ron deau was also associated with
Mosinee Cold Storage and Wausau Cold Storage.
Mr. Forester’s letter to Rondeau refers to '’rumors
in the mill" and the District Court found that it was wellknown that Rondeau was purchasing stock.
His purpose, he has testified on deposition;, and
there were some 23 depositions taken in this case — his

10

purpose initially was a matter of investment and continued
to be a matter of investment.
As he acquired more shares, he expressed some
interest in stockholder representation on the board but the
District Court found that the — that he had no control
purpose and took no active steps toxvard the objective of
control until after he received Mr. Forester’s letter,
talked to his attorney, and was advised that in the 13D he
would have to state a purpose.
The conservative advice given by attorneys In
filing 13D schedules is to state any purpose that you have
or may have so that the veracity of your 13D cannot later
be challenged if you decide to procede with a tender offer
for a proxy statement.
That was what he did.

But even by the time that

uhe 13 D was filed, he had taken no real active step toward
a tender offer.

He had no financing lined up.

He had not

preceded to a higher or proxy-soliciting firm and et cetera.
T'.ie District Court concluded that there vras no
issue, that Mr. Rondeau had no serious intent to attempt to
obtain control prior to Forester's letter, that Mr. Rondeau
and his associates did not engage in intentional covert or
conspiratorial conduct, rather, that the violation was
unintentional and we submit the simple fact of the way he
purchased the shares and how they were registered and the

XI
fact that he knew that they knew that he was purchasing
supports that and that Mr. Rondeau’s schedule 13D met the
requirements of the Act.
The Court therefore concluded that since there was
an unintentional mistake and with the passage of tine, it
being some one year and a half after the violation had
occurred, that it was appropriate to dismiss the complaint.
It is now, of course, several years after the
violation.

There has been no tender offer.

no proxy contest.

There has been

Annual meetings have been conducted in

the years 1971, or ’72, ’73 and ’7*f without contest.
As I have noted before, the motion for a prelinary
injunction was withdrawn.
The Court of Appeals took quite a different view.
The Court of Appeals, in my view, accepted the
facts as recited by Mr. — by Judge Doyle but the Court
of Appeals held that since there was a violation, there had
to be some sort of a remedy and ordered a permanent
injunction against further violation and a sterilization
of 3 percent of the stock, by which I mean, he could not
exercise the ordinary rights of the shareholder to vote
3 percent of his shares, the difference between the 5 per­
cent and the 8 percent that he ultimately acquired.
The Court of Appeal’s decision is somewhat ambigu­
ous on the matter of harm.

They do say that Mosinee was

12
harmed back in 1971 because they got the 13D information
late but there is no indication of continuing harm or any
harm in 197^ and they go on to state that, in all events, no
proof of irreparable harm is necessary.
Obviously, this was a matter that was debated among
the judges because there is a strong dissent by Judge Pell
and a thorough discussion which I commend to the Court.
There was no finding by the Court of Appeals of
a reasonable likelihood of future violations which would,
I submit, be necessary to afford a permanent injunction and
there was no explanation by the Court of Appeals of a nexus
between the violation, any harm that may have resulted from
the violation, and the relief that is ordered.
In short, the relief that is ordered really doesn't
bear any relationship, I submit, to what the court found the
violation to be or the harm to have existed back in 1971,
if there was.
Perhaps I should state clearly what we are not
contending.
We do not dispute that the Act was violated.
qo

We

not dispute Mosinee's standing to bring this suit,

although it cannot, by this suit, benef5.t its shareholders
who bought or sold stock during the period of violation.
n°k contend that injunctive or other remedies
are inappropriate in all eases.

In fact, we concede and

13
contend that injunctions and other remedies are appropriate
in some cases.

Much of the response —

QUESTION:

Has there been any litigation by any of

the shareholders who sold their stock to your client alter
May and before August?
MR. BECKWITH:

There was a suit filed by the

Valley Trust Company — I may have the name wrong — by
counsel for — same counsel that represents Mosinee.
Wisconsin Valley Trust Company happens to be the
stock registrar for Mosinee Paper Company and Mr. Forester
was the chairman of Mosinee.

.

That suit has not been pursued.

Obviously,

Rondeau would contest their standing to be a proper
representative under Rule 23, as pleaded as a class action.
It simply has pended.
QUESTION:

And the class, the asserted class is

the time of his violation until the time you made the 13D.

Is that it?

Mr. Justice, I am not certain

is one of those two.
QUESTION:

This, I suppose, had been a relatively

inactive over-the-counter market for the stock, had It?

MR. BECKWITH:
history.

Well, I dorffc know the trading

I think it was traded relatively actively .
Incidentally, Mr. Forester himself, in his trust

that he managed, purchased 20,000 shares in the days of
July 30 and the few days following.

And of oourse, the

question would be raised as together shareholders who sold
to Mr. Forester who then had inside information might also
have the suit.
So it is a tangled skein on that side.
But this action, I submit, cannot adjust any rights
between shareholders of the corporation, Mr. Rondeau and any
other shareholders or former shareholders.
The purpose of the Williams Act, in our view, is
to provide many of the rules of contest for tender offers
end pretender offers.

It is a notice statute.

It filled

the gap that existed in the 1934 Aot.
Once a proper schedule is filed, the Aot has done
its job unless some sort of a cooling-off period may be
required.

For that reason, most cases involve preliminary

injunctions.
The act of not-proscribed conduct, which is malum in
Ses that is to say, an uninformed businessman possessing the
highest sense of business ethics would not necessarily know
that if he purchased more than 5 percent of the stock of a
corporation, he was guilty of violating a federal law and

15
required to file a schedule.
Now, that does not excuse the violation and that is
not our position.
QUESTION:

What it does — excuse me, Mr, Justice.
Mr. Beckwith —

MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

~ did Judge Pell’s dissent indicate

that on appeal to the Seventh Circuit the Plaintiff
questioned the propriety of granting summary judgment
suggesting that your client was not quite the innocent
victim that he suggested he was?
Now, the Seventh Circuit majority apparently was
willing to take Judge Doyle at his word that these fact3
were undisputed, but are they not in a position to raise
here, if they raised in the Seventh Circuit, the question
as to whether Judge Doyle should have resolved these
questions without a factual hearing?
MR. BECKWITH:

Well, in our reply brief, we suggest

that the issue was not raised in the petition for certiorari.
There vras no cross-petition and that, therefore, it is not
properly before the Court.

But 1 would say to you,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that even if one were to take that
argument and even If one were to accept the fact — and I
might state in our argument — in our arguments to Judge
Doyle and In our briefs to Judge Doyle, we said, ’’Give
Mosinee his facts and give them all the inferences that they

16
v/arvfc from the facts.1'
With the passage of time and with the fact that the
13D has been filed, it doesn’t make any difference.
QUESTION:

Whatever Mr. Rondeau’s motive might have

been in the first instance.
MR. BECKWITH:

That is right.

I think there Is

ample evidence — and if the Court is inclined to review the
facts de novo, which I think would be unwise, but if that
were to happen, there Is ample evidence to support Judge
Doyle's conclusion and the arguments of that or the
description of that will be found in our Seventh Circuit
brief which is — I have the record that it is filed here.
QUESTION:

Well, when you talk about ample evidence

to support a judge’s conclusion, It sounds like you are
talking about something which has occurred after the trial
and findings of facts.
MR. BECKWITH:

I appreciate that and that has been

the argument of Moslnee’s counsel.

What I really mean to

say is that if you look at the testimony, there is not a
substantial or significant material dispute as to the
operative facts.
Those areas in which there might be

3ome

dispute

or in which you might draw some inference differently are
not essential, are not operative so far as the decision of
this case.

Act that it

balance and it was not the intent of Congress that the
Williams Act could be used as a vehicle by management to
neutralise a stockholder who might be kicking off the traces.

It is our position that the proper administration
of the Williams Act should provide for flexibility * that the
remedy 3hould be carefully tailored to cure any corporate
harm flowing from the violations as distinguished from
anxiety by management.
For instance, a limited injunction for a coolingoff period might be appropriate in some cases.

punitive remedy.

That is a

The Act should be administered to avoid

tipping the balance

between the tender offeror and manage­

ment .
The equal opportunity for the offeror and manage­
ment to present their case will be frustrated if management
can invoke a technical violation to prevent a large stock­
holder from exercising his rights for a long period of time.
There must be a showing of continuing, irreparable
harm to the ccrpor&tion as there was, Incidentally, in the
Bath case, which is one of the leading lower-court cases
and is a Seventh Circuit court case.
Mosinee argues that such a continuing irreparable

harm is not required.

A punitive remedy is

inappropriate

and a punitive remedy will not deter unintentional violation.
As we point out in our brief, there is no way that
a person uninformed of the Act will be deterrred by a
punitive — we subroit punitive remedy here and I commend to
your reading the opinion of Judge Mansfield in the Second
Circuit in Corenoo, 48S B'eti. 2nd which we have cited at 214
on this subject.
There should be no permanent injunction In this or
any other case, I submit, absent a finding of a reasonable
likelihood of future violations that will cause ham to
the corpoj»ation and in that regard, the standard should be
higher in private litigation than it is in SEC litigation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beckwith, if

what incentive is there left
MR. BECKWITH:

you prevail here,

for anyone to file a form?

Well, there is ample incentive, as

this case we11-illustrates.
Litigation — ever, an unintentional violation can
result in litigation and will result in litigation which can
tie up a shareholder who has any intent to tender or
engage in a proxy contest.
do.

It would be a foolish thing to

There is plenty of incentive for a shareholder to file.
The only time that there will be — Mr. Justice

Blackmon — tho time when you will find that deterrence is
a factor is where you have an intentional,

covert,

19
conspiratorial violation by a group who thinks that it can
obtain some strategic advantage by not filings by keeping
their purpose disclosed and by proceeding to accumulate a
large block of stock.
That is the time when you — perfectly properly —
a district judge would enter an injunction.

Those are the

facts in Bath and in that case, an injunction was entered.
But even in that case, the injunction

provided

that the parties — the defendants would be enjoined only
until a legally-sufficlent schedule I3D was filed.
Respondent has argued that Mo3inee shareholders vrere
deprived of information for a period of time.
to that is, what information?

My response

What did Mr. Rondeau have to

tell them in May and June that was important to them?
Furthermore, this case will not affect the rights
between shareholders.

The remedy does nothing for share­

holders who bought or sold and I think the harm to share­
holders that is referred to repeatedly by Mosinee

should

be put in context.
We are talking about 16,000 shares that were
purchased after May 27th out of a total of 800,000 shares
Issued and outstanding.
Suppose the shareholders purchased stock, x*rhich is
one of Mosinee’s arguments, expecting the company to be

20

stable and not knowing that there might be a tender offer.
Those shareholders were not harmed.

As soon as the schedule

13D was filed, if they decided that it was not an appropri­
ate investment, they could have sold and sold at a gain.
So no one was materially injured by the harm here
and certainly not the corporation.

But even if shareholders

were harmed, this action is not directed to that purpose.
This action has to do with corporate harm only.
The cases that are relied upon by the Respondent
principally involve preliminary injunctions and we submit
are in all instances distinguishable on their facts,
particularly such cases as Chris-Craft and Butler Aviation.
Two lower court decisions support Judge Doyle,
Tri-State Motor and Scott versus Multi-Amp, both of which
are cited by us.
QUESTION:

Is Tri-State Motor out of the Eighth

Circuit?
MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

On affirmance, wasn’t it?

MR» BECKWITH:

Yes, it was affirmance of a

District Court decision.
QUESTION:

Is that any precedent under the Eighth

Circuit rule if they don’t publish it?
MR. BECKWITH:

I don't think so arid it was cited in

our petition for certiorari and it was cited in our brief.

21
It was referred to by Judge Pell pointing out a split in the
circuits.
QUESTION:

Whether It is precedent or not, in that

circuit it is, at least arguably, in conflict from that
point of view.
MR. BECKWITH:

Oh, I think that is correct, yes.

I am not sure that its precedent is such but if I were the
judge in the Eighth Circuit, I suppose I'd be mindful of
that case.
QUESTION:

Did you say that the injunction entered

here attached to the restricted voting of the stock, in
no matter whose hands the stock was?
MR. BECKWITH:
it dce3.

Well, it is not clear but presumably

By footnote, Respondent tries to massage that

relief a bit to suggest something else that might be done
but it simply says the 3 percent of the stock that
Mr. Rondeau purchased shall be sterilised for a period of
five years.

It Is not clear when the five years start so —

QUESTION:

So if he tried to sell, the purchaser

might not be so enthusiastic.
MR. BECKWITH:

That could well be.

Certainly, if

the purchaser could In any respect be tied to Mr. Rondeau,
then 1 am sure that even Respondent would argue that
sterilization was covered but It is not clear as to the
scope of it.

22

I believe I have some time remaining which I would
like to reserve.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Beckwith.

Mr. Hammond.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. C. HAMMOND, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HAMMOND:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Initially, I would like to comment on Mr. Beckwith's
statement to Justice Rehnquist regarding the status of the
findings of fact.

It is our position that the Seventh

Circuit Court of Appeals did not adopt the findings of
fact of Judge Doyle and I do not think that one can discern
from, the opinion of the Seventh Circuit that that is, in
fact, the situation.
Judge Pell, in the dissent, takes that position
but I do not think that it is essential to the Court's
determination and I do not think that the Court did adopt
all of the findings of Judge Doyle.
QUESTION:

Well, then, where did the Seventh

Circuit get its findings from If it didn't adopt Judge
Doyle’s?
MR. HAMMOND:

It got Its findings, Justice Rehnquist,

from giving due deference to most of the claims of innocence
of Mr. Rondeau and the facts that were on the record that

23

came up and coming to the conclusion that whether you give
that due deference or not., the nature of the violation by
Mi*. Rondeau x^as such as would warrant relief.
QUESTION:

So in effect it resolved all doubts in

favor of Mr. Rondeau and still said an injunction was
warranted.
MR. HAMMOND:

That is what I believe they did.

And I would like to get into just what I think the
Seventh Circuit concluded on the facts in presenting my
argument.
As counsel says, there is no question of what
violation did, in fact, occur and the issue apparently is
whether the relief

granted in this instance by the Seventh

Circuit is appropriate under the circumstances where the
wrong was committed.
There is no doubt in this instance that the market
operated for a substantial period of time without knowing
that Mr. Rondeau was involved in substantial acquisitions
of shares to the level that the Congress has said is
sufficient to prompt the necessity for giving public notice
and when one says the notice must be given to the company,
to the Exchanges upon which the stock is traded and to the
SEC, one has to acknowledge that this notice is really a
notice that is flowing to the public.
It Is the public that is Involved.

Whether the

public be involved in accurately buying shares today or
conceivably buying them tomorrow or selling shares today or
selling them tomorrow, the failure to give the notice
operated to the disadvantage of those people who sold their
shares at the time Rondeau was buying.
QUESTION:

Yes, but those people aren’t the plain­

tiffs in this case.
MR. HAMMOND:

That is correct, Justice Stewart.

operated to their disadvantage, just one class.

It

It operated

to the disadvantage of sellers who sold during that

time

period because if the knowledge had been public that this
was going on and that Mr. Rondeau was quickly acquiring
shares, that would have a substantial effect on the market
price.

It certainly affected or would have affected the

judgment of people who buy shares because they look to a
company for stability, long-term accretions in capital and
in fact, are — abhor getting involved in companies that
have internal turmoil or management conflicts.
Those people could still buy under these circum­
stances not knowing that there is a potential conflict and
I think the Court must keep in mind that it is not the
question of whether or not there is or is not intention at
the time to take over control of the company, that is, the
real objective of giving the notice.
Ic is t,he potential for the conflict, potential for

change in management,, potential for corporate operation to
continue, potential for sufficient market interest to
Increase stock price.
Those are the things the 13D is aimed to provide
publicity for and it is the mere potential that that goes
on by virtue of one acquiring five percent of the stock of
a company that prompts the Act to come into effect and the
requisite for giving public notice.
It operates to the distraction of management of a
company whose obligation it is to see that information is
disseminated to its shareholders and see that their interests
are protected and when the instance arises that it suddenly
discovers somewhat belatedly someone is involved in buying
stock and starts passing the information cut, it then must
get involved In litigation, as counsel says, because litigation is probably one of the only vehicles by which people
can be required to conform to the law and that is a sub­
stantial distraction from the operation of a company.
All of these things flow from violation of 13D.
Now, some members of this class — or one of these
classes, are clearly identifiable and perhaps the damages
that flow to them are easily discernible.
You can, for instance, take a look at the market
and come to some conclusion as to what the level of damages
is to someone who sold it, not knowing that this was going on

or bought not knowing that this was going on.

But when

you come to the issue of whether or not someone who got
into the market at a later date not knowing — and the stock
never fluctuated in price — what his injury is or the man
ivho bought because he was looking for stability and then
finds a company that is wracked in turmoil and has all kinds
of considerations as to when he should sell and whether or
not he should get out, tax considerations, other consider­
ations, these people are also injured and I think that one
issue that gets to the question — or these are facts that
get to the question of whether or not irreparable injury is
really required and I would like to say on that that 1 do
not think that irreparable Injury in the classic sense is
required in order to prompt the initiation and attainment
of relief in this kind of case.
QUESTION:

If Congress had Intended that,

Mr. Hammond, It would have been a very easy matter for them
to have written that into the Act, would it not?
MR. HAMMOND:

That Is true, Mr. Justice 3urger,

but by the same token, Congress has not written into the Act
many of the rights that have been pursued under the Securitie
law, under Section 10(B)(5), under Section 16(B), under
shortswing profits, they do notj ln fact establish —
QUESTION:

Well, but when you are departing from

a very firmly-established traditional remedy of equity in the

form of an injunctions it is a little different, isn't it,
from some of the other factors you are alluding to?
MR. HAMMOND:

I don't think so, Justice Burger.

In

fact, I think that the Court could have gone much farther in
this case than it, in fact, went.

I think the Court could

have ordered that he dispose of the stock.

I think that

would probably be the ultimate penalty that they would
impose but I think that they —

I

QUESTION:

All of it, or just the excess over 5

percent or what —?
MR. HAMMOND:

I think that if the situation were

aggravated enough, all of it.

If he —• if the facts were to

disclose that this was a concerted plan devised for

acquiring

control of a company and the level of acquisition had
achieved the level of control, for instance, that under those
circumstances, he could be required to dispose of all of it.
I think that one must gradate the kind of ultimate
result as is commensurate with the wrongdoing.
In this case, I think the Seventh Circuit struck a
very happy balance.
Getting back for a few moments to the issue of whe­
ther or not the balance is really appropriate, I think that
regardless of the level of conspiratorial intentional
violation that counsel seems to think is essential for any
klne Oj. relief, that the Seventh Circuit in fact said wass

28
there is

as much damage perpetrated — as much mischief

prompted by careless abandon and disregard of the laws in
the securities field as there can be, by virtue of an inten­
tional violation and in this case, I think the facts clearly
show, without equivocation, that Mr. Rondeau acted in clear
abandon of the law and made no effort whatsoever to pursue
it in accordance with the level of requirement imposed upon
him.
One has to take a look —
QUESTION:

I think that is conceded, isn't it?

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

That he violated the law —

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Well, I am not so sure it is conceded.

Mr. Justice, it is conceded he —

— that he clearly, especially,

explicitly violated the law,
MR. HAMMOND:

But it is not conceded that he — he

is painted as an innocent, mistaken individual, not very
well—skilled

In the law and not very well—acquainted as to

what the legal requirements are.

But I think if you look at

hj.s business background, he is a knowledgeable businessman.
He Is not unaquainted with the legal requirements.
president of a couple of corporations.

He is a

He is the head of a

foundation which undoubtedly was established, for rather
sophisticated tax reasons.

He is a limited partner.

He has set up limited partnerships so he can hold

29
his property separate from his operating business.

He is

engaged in many sort of sophisticated activities including
the banking industry.
QUESTION:

Well, if we were going to speculate about

the facts here, one speculation would be that if he knew
about this law, he certainly would have complied with it —
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

— because he had absolutely nothing to

gain from not complying with it.
MR. HAMMOND:

But there is a substantial benefit to

achieve by not complying.

The benefit to achieve is that if

you do comply and you advise the market that you are
acquiring and that you have some information and that there
nhy be a tender offer or proxy war in the offing, the people
who sold their stock suddenly are not very willing to sell
it.

At least, they are not willing to sell it at the prices

they were formerly willing to sell it at.
So Mr. Rondeau derives the benefit of the market
staying stable during that period of time when he does not
report it.
In addition, Mr. Rondeau achieves the benefit of
surreptitious involvement, communicating with others, all of
which the management is unaware of.
QUESTION:

But I thought it was the management that

called his attention to the fact that he might be in legal

30

trouble.
MR. HAMMOND:

And that is true, because the

management's obligation is to advise the public and to see
that Mr. Rondeau, when they find out that he is engaged in a
violation, advised the public.

And it was in this Instance

the management that advised him on July 30th when it finally
discovered — or did not even discover — guessed, based
upon putting together a lot of facts, that Mr. Rondeau was,
in fact, in violation, that they said, we think we have a
securities problem here.
Mr. Rondeau, however, did not promptly file — 25
days later he filed his first 13D.
QUESTION:

Were Mr. Forester and Mr. Rondeau good

friends?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

I do not believe so.

And yet they are on a first-name basis,

aren’t they?
MR. HAMMOND:
is

No, I think that Mr. Scholtens, who

the president cf Mosinee and Mr. Rondeau are good friends

and they are on a first-name basis,
QUESTION:

Well, I am looking at the —

QUESTION:

Whatever they were, they no longer are,

I would presume.
[Laughter.]
MR. HAMMOND:

No, I don’t even think that is fair to

31
say, Justice Stewart.

I think Mr. Scholtens and Mr. Rondeau

are still good friends, although, probably, there is a little
bit more apartheid involved.
QUESTION:

The July 30th letter, at least, is on a

first-name basis, the one to which you made reference.
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Who is "Chum?”

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Chum is the president of the company.

That is a nickname?

MR. HAMMOND:

Yes.

But when he did file the 13D, I think the Court
should take notice of the rather debatable way in which hi3
posture was put forward.
I think that the Seventh Circuit came to the
conclusion that, regardless of how you view this violation,
it requires some sort of .responsible response and it is on
that basis that the Seventh Circuit gave the response which
it did.
I think that it is essential when one recognises in
this day and age the manner in which shares can be held,
that it is essential to give some deference to the manner
in which securities violations are pursued.
The SEC certainly would have a great deal of
difficulty in pursuing violations.

As a matter of fact,

about the only time a violation truly gets called to the

32
attention of the SEC would be when a filing occurs and the
filing is erroneous.
The only other Instance would be if a company became
aware cf the violation and made its call and determined that
the violation had occurred and let the SEC
would have to

and the SEC

pursue all of these things.

Decisions of the courts in this country in the
circuit courts of appeals have said that companies are acting
in the capacity of private attorneys-general in pursuing
violations that occur in the securities law and that should
not be discouraged.
The private attorneys-general are the only ones, the
companies, who really have the best opportunity to perceive
when violation occurs because it is on their transfer book
ultimately that the recordation of the violations takes
place — perhaps.
And I say perhaps because in these sophisticated
days, people very often do not hold their stock in their own
name.

They hold them in street names.

in street

And if one holds them

names, even then it is very difficult to ascertain

when a violation occurs.
In this particular instance, Mr. Rondeau did not
use street names, althougn he used multiple corporations and
foundations for acquisition of stock.
Counsel says that he held 3*1,000 in his own name.

33
But 34,000 is less than 5 percent and as a matter
of fact, in the first communication that took place between
Mr. Scholtens and Mr. Rondeau, the conversation was that he
intended to buy up to 40,000 shares, a very unusual figure
for a man to use who has no knowledge of the securities law
when one recognises that in this case, 5 percent is about
300 shares over 40,000.
I submit that the facts can paint Mr. Rondeau in
several fashions and in this particular instance, the Seventh
Circuit came to the conclusion that even if you accept the
painting that i3 given by Mr. Beckwith, non-int'entional,
covert, conspiratorial — but nevertheless a businessman
who is reasonably knowledgeable in the law who was about to
embark on a million-dollar investment in a corporation, who
did nothing to confer with counsel to determine whether or
not he was — it was necessary that he engage in any kind of
protective tilings

- who was aware, at least the year before

that at 10 percent he had to file, but who went ahead without
regard and caused this kind of consternation in the market
then, under those circumstances, that some relief should be
afforded.
If you do not grant relief under circumstances such
as that, there is no deterrence to one who attempts to
utilize the failure to file to his advantage and this
particular case, as I indicated, it did work to Mr. Rondeau?s

3*1
advant age.
QUESTION:

Do you think chat Judge Doyle may have

taken into consideration the fact that Mr. Rondeau lived in
Mosinee and that Mosinee Paper Corporation has its head­
quarters in Mosinee and that Mosinee is a town of about

2,500, in deciding whether to issue an injunction?
MR. HAMMOND:

I think Judge Doyle may have taken

that into consideration but if he did, I think it is
erroneous because to say that it was generally known that
Mr. Rondeau was buying shares is a misleading statement if
you are attempting to state that the market was aware that
Mr. Rondeau was engaging in purchase of stock.
The market Is not Wausau.
a stock traded over-the-counter.

The market is — this is
It is traded widely and

there are a great many people involved and if Judge Doyle
came to the conclusion that the mere fact that a number of
People on the street knew that Mr. Rondeau, was buying shares
and that was sufficient to really cause a nondisclosure of
violation or protect, then I should think that that is an
overstatement or an erroneous conclusion to draw from that
fact.
The very essence of the requirement for disclosure
and the filing is to disseminate the information throughout
the market and the potential market and that was not achieved
In this case.

35
QUESTION:

When did Mosinee first start monitoring

the buying of this stock?
MR. HAMMOND:
such.

They never really monitored it as

I think that is an erroneous statement.

What happened

is, sometime in June, I think, they came to the conclusion
that based upon Mr. Rondeau’s buying and the recordation on
the stock transfer book that he was — he had purchased a
substantial number of shares and I think it comes to about
15,000 shares.
At that point, they called him to welcome him as a
substantial shareholder.
After that, they found out that he continued to
buy and when they became aware of the fact that he was
continuing to buy and approaching a very high level, then
they started watching and monitoring.
QUESTION:

And that was when?

MR. HAMMOND:

And that was in — I would say it

was probably in late June or July.
QUESTION:

Of the same year?

MR. HAMMOND:

Of the same year.

It was not until July 30th when, coupled with the
rumors and attempting to put together the various corpora­
tions and fcundations that they knew Mr. Rondeau had involve­
ment in, that the company began to suspect that he had
violated and gone beyond the 40,309 shares.

QUESTION:

And they promptly told him?

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

And 25 days later he filed.

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

And they promptly told him.

Twenty-five days later he filed.

Your complaint is what?

MR. HAMMOND:

The complaint is that one, he should

have filed way back when he first — ten days after he
achieved 5 percent, which was May 17th.
QUESTION:

And how many days now are we talking

about?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

How many days did Mosines suffer?

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

For what, Justice Marshall?

I think Mosinee continues to suffer.

Until now.

MR. HAMMOND:

I think they continue to suffer now,

to the fact that they are distracted from their normal
business by pursuing this violation.

After all, it is four

years later now but they are still involved in litigation —
QUESTION:

You mean, this litigation Is affecting

the company?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

This litigation distracts —

Well, who else is involved In it but

you?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Management, that has to get —

What is management doing about It?

37
MR. HAMMOND:

It has to give time and attention

and make decisions as to whether or not they are going to
process appeals.

But that is only a small fraction of it.

In addition to that, I think there are people,
Justice Marshall, who are —- who bought stock in the company
during that time period, who may still own the stock and are
looking for the company to settle back to its stability.
QUESTION:

All right, any such complaints on file?

Or is that out of the clear blue?
MR. HAMMOND:

Well, I think it is out of the clear

blue, Justice Marshall, but it is out of the clear blue with
some degree of realism.
QUESTION:
go ahead.

I think that when you talk about —

Out of the clear blue with some *— oh,

I'll catch up with you.
MR. HAMMOND:

When one talks about irreparable

harm, unfortunately I think, too often one comes to the
conclusion that that is such a horrendous harm occasioned
to individuals as to be immeasurable in dollars and
unaccountable and I think that there is a great area of
irreparable harm that has to do with the sort of out of the
blue, only evaluative by conjecture, that is occasioned to
people by virtue of other peoples' wrongdoings for which
protection must be afforded and which —
QUESTION:

Do you know of any equity case that has

used the phrase, "considered irrevocable harm, out of the

38
blue"?

You have got to be specific when you say "Irreparable

harm."
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

I do —

What is harm and what is irreparable?

MR. HfVMMOND:

I do think, however, Mr. Justice

Marshall
QUESTION:

But don’t take both of them out of the

clear blue, please.
MR. HAMMOND:

I do think that there are cases that

say that irreparable harm covers the spectrum of wrong or
damages, including those which are so superficial as to be —
and so diffuse — as not to be measurable but yet to be
wrongs that are occasioned to people and I think this includes
that kind of a wrong and I think when you enforce the
securities law, it is intended to protect the kinds of
people, not the sophisticated investor,, but the man on the
street Mho buys —
QUESTION:

But the man is — all the securities law

said was to file it,.
MR. HAMMOND:

He has filed it.
That is true.

But it also says that

the wrong that he accomplishes by not filing during the time
period must be set right.

I think that is natural and In

addition to that, If one is to only consider that once one
files that that remedies the wrong, there is no incentive
to file.

39
QUESTION:

Mr. Hammond, would, your client, Mosinee,

have had an action for money damages?
MR. HAMMOND:

I think that — yes, I think that my

client could bring a claim for money damages.

I think it

would be almost impossible to prove what the damages are in
dollars and cents.

I think under the normal

rules of

evidence it would be practically impossible.
How do you evaluate the distraction of management
during the course of processing these things?
QUESTION:

You didn't ask for damages, did you?

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

I think we asked for money damages.

You did.

MR. HAMMOND:

Yes.

I think it x^ould be almost

impossible to —
QUESTION:

That has just dropped out of the case,

has it?
MR. HAMMOND:

Yes, it has just dropped out of the

case.
QUESTION:

There are cases, of course — or are

there not? — under this statute where money damages have
been allowed to shareholders.
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

That is true, yes.

Well, certainly.

Where the damage is relatively easy to

prove.
MR. HAMMOND:

Where It is easy to prove and where the

•40

damage Is of sufficient substance as to warrant the pursuit
of the litigation in that fashion.
QUESTION:

Isn’t this cause of action a judicial

ere at i.on anyway ?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is a judicial creation.

Congress has not provided for it one

way or another.
MR. HAMMOND:

No.

It flows from that body of law

which says if there is a prohibitory statute or a directory
statute which requires an

act and it is violated that the

wrong that is occasioned to people prompts relief or warrants
relief and including injunctive relief.
QUESTION:

And your submission is that in fashioning

that remedy, the judiciary should grant an injunction oven
absent irreparable injury.
MR. HAMMOND:

Even absent irreparable injury.

But

i. am not willing to acknowledge in this case that there is no
irreparable injury because 7. think, as I explained to Justice
Marshall, that it covers that difficult-to-prove diffuse
area of injury,
QUESTION:

Mr. Hammond, does the record show what

percentage of the stock in Mosinee Paper Company is owner or
controlled by management, using management to Include the
board of directors and officers?
MR. HAMMOND:

No, I do not think it does.

QUESTION:

Would you say 50 percent?

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

No, I do not believe so.

What percentage?

MR. HAMMOND:

Well, I think the only information

that is provided is the ownership of Mr. Forester, who is
the chairman of the board and his company is — and I do not
recall offhand what it is, but it is substantially less than
controlling interest.
QUESTION:

What percentage would you regard as

evidence of control?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Well —

The SEC uses the figure, 10 percent in a

good many contexts.

Are you talking about 25 percent?

MR. HAMMOND:

Well, in this instance, the statute

really talks about 5 percent as being a controlling interest,
whatever controlling interest means and the law set3 it at
different standards, different levels.
QUESTION:

But if you don’t —

MR. HAMMOND:

In this particular instance, I think

if one controlled 25 percent, one may well have control of
the company.
QUESTION:

The statement of the facts in the

petitioner's brief says that Mr. Forester, his wife and the
trust managed by him were collectively the largest share­
holders in Mosinee.

You would agree that is true?

42
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

Mr. Hammond, broadly speaking, there are

two categories of stockholders, those xdio are in management,
as I have indicated how management might be

defined, and

just the run-of-the-mill stockholder who owns his stock as
an investment.
It Isn't clear to me from what you have said sc
far how the latter category of stockholders will benefit if
you win this case.
it.

Or even would benefit from your bringing

I can perceive how management may be an entirely

different category because insulating 3 percent of the stock
from participating in voting would tend to entrench management
but focus your response to my question on the non­
management stockholders.
MR. HAMMOND:

The question, as I understand it, is

what benefit will flow to those non-management shareholders
in the event —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

— we are successful in the suit.

Yes.

MR, HAMMOND:

I think the only response to that one

can give is that Mr. Rondeau will be precluded from
utilizing shares he Improperly acquired and to the extent
that those people are shareholders who are satisfied with the
operation of the company, who bought the stock for normal

business accretion, earnings, that the company which they
bought into will have those characteristics.
At least, it will not be beset by those particular
shares acquired in violation of being utilized to create
turmoil in the company.
That is about the only degree to which those people
will be benefited.
QUESTION:

There may

possibly be shareholders who

are not entirely enchanted by management.
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

There may be.

Who might welcome a tender offer.

MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION;

That is true.

There are —

That is one of the premises of the

Williams Act, isn’t it?
i

MR. HAMMOND:

That is correct.

As a matter of fact,

that may well be one of the class of people who are so
diffuse as not to be recognizable as being injured.
There are people in today’s market who buy shares
solely for the purpose of getting involved in corporations
'-hat have chis kind of conflict going on because they see
quick accretions in value and those people would not be
involved in this because of the non-filing of Mr. Rondeau.
The entire thing is geared for knowledge but when
one talks about the knowledge, one must put it in perspective
and the perspective is, that it must be related to the shares

44
that are acquiree', in the transactions in the market that
take place or don’t take place as a consequence of the lack
of knowledge.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hammond, I gather there will be

further proceedings in the District Court?
MR. HAMMOND:

There would be further proceedings

-n the District Court under the Seventh Circuit’s decision.
QUESTION:

Because there has to •— I guess the date

from which the five years begins has yet to be established,
doesn’t it?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And what about the colloquy you had

with your colleague whether Mr. Rondeau is In any position
where he cannot dispose of the stock?
MR. HAMMOND:
QUESTION:

I think that —

Will that matter have to be straightened

out, too?
MR. HAMMOND:

Yes and I do not believe that this

in an in realm determination.
QUESTION:

How far do you

think there ought to be

a modification of —
MR. HAMMOND:

I think that Mr. Rondeau Is — is free

to dispose of his shares without the restriction of the
voting rights on those particular shares subject, of course,
to e. restriction on the voting right if he were to engage In

45
a sale as a subterfuge.
QUESTION:

In other words, sell It to one of his

corporations.
HR. HAMMOND:

One of his corporations or one of

his friends who would agree to vote it for him.
QUESTION:

Do you think — would you press for

any

kind of a restriction on his right to transfer the shares?
MR. HAMMOND:

No, I do not believe that I would

put any restriction on his right to transfer shares.
QUESTION:

If he wanted to sell them all in one

day, regardless of the effect on the market, it would be
all right with you?
MR. HAMMOND:

Well, I think that there are some

restrictions on his right to sell it that way.

I think

there are securities regulations that would prohibit him
from selling by putting it all on the market one day.

I

think he would have to register it as an offering, a
secondary offering.
So I think there are controls in that fashion.

I

do think that the Court should — that the summary judgment
issue is properly before the Court and I think that there is
a determination that anything which would support the trial
court or the Circuit Court of Appeals determination is
properly before the Court and the Circuit Court determination
Is the upsetting or the overruling of the summa.ry judgment

46
and I think that that should also be considered by the
Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* Mr. Hammond.

Do you have anything further* Mr. Beckwith?
MR. BECKWITH:

Just a few points, Mr. Chief

Justice.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. BECKWITH, ESQ.
MR. BECKWITH:

Mr. Justice Powell, a pro pos of

your question to my colleague, Mr. Hammond, Section 13D is
not designed to promote management stability. Which is the
phrase used repeatedly in argument

and the briefs.

In fact, there is no public policy that says a
stable management is necessarily a good management or a
beneficial management and, indeed, it may be to the advantage
of shareholders to permit a large, Influential stockholder
like Mr. Rondeau to exercise his rights and see that the
corporation Is better managed.
So far as the effect —
QUESTION:

Even If It doesn't ultimately take over?

MR. BECKWITH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Just the —

MR. BECKWITH:

His lurking presence, effective

lurking presence may be helpful.
Now, so, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, on the factual

matter, I call your attention to that portion of the Court
of Appeals' decision which is reported on page 169 of the
Appendix where they say, "Having considered all circumstances
concerning Hr. Rondeau’s violation of 13D, giving effect
especially tc the District Court’s findings that Mr. Rondeau
and the other defendants did not engage in intentional,
covert and conspiratorial conduct in failing to timely
file the 13D and was unaccompanied by tender offer or proxy
solicitation, we instruct this District Court —" and so
forth.
Had the Circuit Court considered other facts, it
seems to me they would have had to remand for a trial.
Pour judges have considered these factual
arguments and have rejected them and there is no indication
that the Seventh Circuit accepted them.
Pour years have gone by since this technical — I
submit — technical violation occurred in the spring and
summer of 1971.

If manavment has been distracted for four

years, it is by

virtue of its own conduct, not by virtue

of Mr. Rondeau’s conduct.
So far as the arguments that classes have been
damaged in whatever manner, whether it is out of the blue or
any other way, I submit those arguments are directed
primarily to the question of violation or standing and not
remedy.

The issue here is remedy, not whether management
can sue or should sue, or whether somebody might be injured
or will be injured, the question is, what do we do now,
four years later?
The Seventh Cirucit Court of Appeals' decision, I
submit, will lead to abuse in our circuit.

It will turn

this Act that was designed to provide fair rules of conduct
in tender offer situations into a weapon that can be used by
management to neutralize a shareholder that may effectively
gain conoroi or affect the management of a corporation and
that is good.

That is not bad.

So far as the benefit to Mr. Rondeau in not filing,
it was well-known he was purchasing stock.

Mr. Forester

wrote to the directors on May 7th — that is just about 30
Uayo after Mr. Rondeau made his first purchase — calling
t/hair

cent ion to the fact that Mr. Rondeau was purchasing

stock and I believe the record shows that Mr. Forester and
Mr. Scholtens started tabulating his purchases virtually
from the first day that they appeared on the registrar of
t^e corporation and that was in about April 26th.
The market price of this stock — it is suggested
tiiat he might have benefitted because he was buying in a
stable market.
cL.l/

Even after he filed his 13D, there was a

or two when the market blipped up.

g*here was no

indication there was any trading at the higher level

•49
because it is over-the-counter but then it settled back at
the same level so but for this lawsuit, Mr. Rondeau could
have purchasing after the 13D at approximately the same
level.
In conclusion, your Honors, I submit that it is
appropriate for this Court to consider the remedy aspect
here and to put Section 13D in the Williams Act back in the
proper context in the Seventh Circuit.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
