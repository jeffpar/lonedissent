QUESTIO\J:

I 1o not think

the quest ton of ·.~>iether a takinp; will, in fact, occur can

But the posoibility it

will occur 1.s clenrly present and therefore, it seems to 'lie
the Tucker /\ct issue !s clearly ripe.
The -- if the 'l'ucv.er "'-" h<--3 been lir:i~ed ::;o that
there can be no co. pensations, either• for interim erosion,

Ra!.l Areociat:ton from deny

t·1e

atandon'1!ents when a tak.!.r,p;

poln'c has occurred. sho •}.d eitlier re "'-n ::.n effect or,
preferably, the statute sho 11ld be read to deny the Rail
/\ssociacion the power to refJse abandonments at a point

23
wh~n the courts hold an t\?lc~,stl ~tto,·l
ocC'urrinr;.
And if the Tucker AC't 11 s been llmited, we ac;ree
that an injunction against certification of a final system
plan for the special report shou\d remain in effect.

I

thinl~ that is preferable to rtrikinc do1m the entire Rail
Act on a theory of uncon:ititut1onality because leaving those
injunctions in effect would give Congress time to reconsider tt.e Tucker Act issue and time to reconsider the
possiblity or makine changes in the Rail Act to obviate the
difficulties .
Because 1',; is an enormoua ef'fort by the Congresa
and I th-1.nk 1.t ought not to be t.;:-t;ctl asit.l~ wholesale
11ithc 11t g•ving Congress time.
QUES'..:'ION:

Suppose we a,ree .;hat the iasuc or

constitutionality can't .>e res <OVed 1-lc"'e 111th any vie:t to
even the probability ,;hat Con~ess would remedy any defects
in the future?

:-n.

BORK:

No, l-ir. Ch.er Ji.Stice, but :::: think

these two injunctions, or reading cne statute in those ways
would eff•JCtively '?rote ct the cred ltor interest against an
unconstitutional taking and also r,ive Congress the option
to reconsider what it 1·is"i.es to do.
But we 1gree that a ::a:<... ng !.o un_ i!re~y in ·~he
const~tutioral sence in havi~c ~ade trosc concession:i and I

24

put myself on the w~onr, side of coun~e~ t~ble for th.s
period of time.
I no11 would l .. ke to addrens our case.
We think that the j ·•c."'lller,1; of tt.o three- udr;c
court- oue-,ht to be rcver'>ed, no .ethcle::is, be-.:au:-c we th:!.n!c it
is perfectly plain t,u1t the Tucker Ac'; rencdy i~ available
and was not repeal.eel by the Rail i'ct.
There is, therefore, no baoi:; fol" the injnnctions
requ·· rinp; abandonments when

urosion reaches tne point of

a takinr, or for an injunction aga~nst certification of the
final system plan.
The Tucker Act

provide:: in per'.;inent part the

court of claims shall have jurisdiction to render judp;ment
upon any cl aim a~ainst the United States founded upon the
Consti';utlon.

The thre~-jud~e a:::trict court, we think, riisstated
th~ issue as to whether Cong •ess intended to ,:,:rant a T1Jcker
Act rer1edy.
I don't think Congress did deliberately intend to
r,rant a 'fucker Act r<>medy in the Rail Act.
The special court correctly posed the issue as
whether Congress, in the Rail Act, intentionally bar r e d the

25
Tucker Act rer.1edy.
The rule :!.s that the Tucker Act is available for
a tak1nr; under the Constitution unless it is removed, not
unless it is sought out and granted.

Those

T11e Tucv:er Act Has available

bf.cau,e a tal<ing had occurred by la1·1ful autho!'ized fl.Ction
o! the covernment.
It seems to me perfectly palin, therefore, that
these Appellees have a Tucker Act reme~y unless the Rail Act
specifically withdraws it.

The!'e is no explicit limitation

of the Tucker Act any1·1here in this enormously detailed
39-page printed statute.
The Tucker Act isn't even 11entioned in this
statute, and that would seem r.urely to be a vcir~· peculiar
o.rere i.ght if' 1•epeal

11,i.s

intended.

I think we "lust therefore examine the Act to
Ste if there :ls a clearly-impl:l':!d repealo~ ano:, in do:'.np so,

we have employed tuo canons of constrt.ction.
Now, Appel.lees' couI1s ?1. have ha<' some fun ;.;ith the
use of these canons or' construction, as I 1;ould, if I had
the1!' side of the case, but these are canons long kno1m to

26
the 1a·1 and tn y 9.re ac bind lnr; upon ConRress in drafting
statuteo because that is how they know how the statute w:1.11
be interpreted, a3 they are indi~rensable to courts in
inte1•pretinr, ctatutes.
I cite Just two.

'l'he first 1:. a repeal by

implication and not favored in our law.
The second was that when there are t110 admissible
constructions of a statute, that construction which will
save the constitutionality o~ the ctatute is favored over
that which conoenmr tt c Act.
T",ere 1o no doubt that trc opponents of the Rail
/let t P.re .:-.r" nsk1nP, for a rart1al re'()eal of the Tucl:er Act
by implication.
T'1ey also urg.:i a constructlon of the Rail Act

~01·,

the strength of this presumption ago.inst

implied "'epeals I think is nuch p:reat,;r in thP. Tucker Act
area than perhaps it is elsewhere and that is sho•m, I
think, tv two cases that I 11ould like tc- mention.
The first is !"E~f~again~! ,in~eid and the second
ls !,,,YfCh rs,;ain:c-J;_tte Urited 3tatcs.
llo•,;, if chose deci.;ions of 'chis Court retain their

•1ita1;;.ty, as I th:ln;( they do, ;hen I ,;hink they are

27

completely dispositive of the- Tucker Act ruestlon here.
The E>pecinl court, in Judr;e Friendly 1 1 opinion,
said that llurlc-y ef'(a~nst Kinc;):l.d. d!d not s11pport our position
as strongly as we had urged it but he went on to note that
there was a case called L:vnch which we had not cited which
did support our position.
We blush as we accept the gift o~ Lynch, but we
continue to believe that Hurley ap;ainst Kincaid has
pertinence here as well.
In that case, the Plaintiff, Kincaid, sued to
enjoin the construc'c:f.on of a fl.ood1fay that threatened his
l and and Section 3 of the Flood Control Act, U'lder which
the Government was proceedj.ne;, stated that no liability of
any kind nhall att:-.ch to or resc; up'ln the United States for
any r\ar,ngc from or by floods.
3ection ll of the Act ?rouided for ad\•ance
co!'lpC'lnt-tion for the taldnr; of J and by condemnation,
neccs ,i:ry lands ancl easements.
IIO\·t,

the pa1-ties advanced as here a wide variety

of factual and legal contentions but the Su;-,reme Court held
simp)y that the injunction should not issue because in the
event a taking occurred, the complainant can recover just
compensation under the Tucker Act in compensatlon at law,
in an action at la1•;.
Hurley

agai!lst Kincaid thu:; s._ands at a minimum

28
for two propositions, tho.t a statutory pro~ ·~n m11:: not be
enjoi'led in anticipation

of' a takinr; where t,1e Tucker Act

1s available .
And thlr,

ic a case, I quppo.c, that goes to t~e

question o · whether thee ripc-'less of thE' ru ... ker Act issue 1s
c"-ear.
A statutory program may not b~ cnjo1nea in
anticipation of a tak1nc whero a Tucker Ac!; remedy is
available.
And, secondly, tha: the repeal of the Tucker Act
is not to be ir."plied from the presence in the procrammed
stat1tc of an alternative method of compensating those
whose property is taken.
These proposition~ are highly relevant here.

Those

who seek to enjoin the operation of the Rail Act argue that
the irnpliod repeal of the Tucker Act is to be found in
Sect tor, 303 of ti-,

:lai 1 Act, ar..onr- other places.

the P'Jrposo of de-:itroy:lng the corst .. ut!.0.1

• ~Y of the very

statute to which the repeal i, ~ttr1buted.
So far as we know, no ca::-c ias ever found an
implied repeal in order to impute to the statute itself an
intention to commit sa1cide.
How, if there is any doubt on this is ~ue, I think
Hurley ar;ainst Kincaid

lays it to rest.

'l.'he Flood Control Act pr,)vided its own means of
property acquistion and compensation ~o' ta~ing.
Defined and implied ropna! 1n llui-ley agalnst
K:lncl'!ic. 11ou1d have been much eas.:er because all that would
htve happened wculcl have been that an injunction would have
'">e~n

f

roued and slo·•;ed the pror;rci,s of the trork until a

co"!.demnation occur~d so that on.t~• inconvenience was involved fn finding an implied repeal there .
1!ere,

defined and implied repeal is to find the

Act unconstitutional in nnjot• aspects and bring the prograr.t
to a conplete halt.
L;:nch a~ainst the United States, the case found
b• Jud•:e ::Jr lendly, reinforces rather than replaces Kincaid
11'.' OU"' argument .

In that case, actions ,,ere brought for proceeds of

In such circumstances ,

policiefl.
The coMp,moo.t:ton , an not r,iven and vhe in:c:u1•ed
d:l.ed.
United States demurred to this lawsuit on the
ground that Section 7 of the ~conomy Act
Economy Act of 1933

Section 17 of the

stated specifically, "All laws

granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance
are hereby repealsed,"

a much more explicit and clear

repealo~ than anything to be found in this case.
'l'hie Su,>1•e:ne Court held that, an applied to
contract riKh'.s, chat repe2lor 1-rns a taking of property
f'orb1.r\den b" the l?1. ftth /\mendment but the Conr,ress, of course,
d:id have the :;,01-:er to withdrau its co,1!!r>nt to suit against
the Jn.i. tea Sti:>t _,; o.nd tl,, Govei•n•r,cnt 'U'r;ued here that it 11as
ol'v:l.ous that

!•en Co11"l'P.SS took a.1t.;{ U e right, it :;hould

bo p"esumcd to have intended to t'lke awt.y the remedy, t1hich
scem0d to be a rather pl~usible argument.
HPverthe less, this Court refused to read the
ctatute as takin~ a.way the remedy in t-he absence of a most
explicit directio~.

It said, "There is no separate

provi.sision in Section 17 dealin

uith the remedy and it

does not appear that Conr,ress wisred to de:1y t!Je reml?dy
lf

the IP.peal of the contrac;ual right uas lleld void

under the "ifth Amendrient."

11

to our case by saving,

"Tranolated into th,1 terms of this case, there is no
sepnr ,te provis:l.on in the

with t~,e Tucl:o • Act rem oy and it docs not api: ar that
Concress wished to deny this rem~dy if the Act i:hould be
held to involve

11

poss'ble taking that would require the

award of a ·ust compensation unde- the Fifth Amendment.
So Lynch demonotrates, I think, ~hat the court

1P not willing to find the repenl of the Tucker Act remedy
unle-::s Conr,reoa spcclfically statc3 that that io what it
wants .

There is a much stronger ·· ndication :ln the Econoll'.y

Now, theoe concluoions from

The ruckc. Act is not mentioned

al'cl yet there are 13 provisions in the RAil Act which deal

with <;he relatior,,hip of other st1.tutes to the PAil Act.
Congress went tllro1-1r-h quite spec! "ically
repealing in part, modifyinr; in part and dealing with the

32
relationr.hips of other ::itatutes in 13 places and I refer you
to Section 601 11hich deals with major statutes and is
specifically entitled, "Relationship to other statutes,"
and it seems quite peculiar to say that Con~ress took
meticulous care to spell out the repeal of ad•1erticlne:
requirements having to do with the entry of Government
contracts but didn't thin!; :lt was ;-,or+;h mentioning that it
was contemplatin~ the uncompen:iated talcing of property.
That is not ju:it improper :;tatutory construction,
I ~h:tnk lt is bizarre <:~atuiory construction.
If' we loolt to the s·;ructure of the Act, we see the
,:i~ne thine;.

Section 304(F) shows that very few abandonments

are to be perr..ltt.;ld, even though there are steady losses
becauce toe::ie line::: must be p:.:'eserved for inclusion in the
final sy~tcm plan.

MR. BORK:

It may

that question of Conr,reso'

reoson,:i for aaying that the three-judge dietrict court did
have jurisd:i.ction and therefore

'.:hat this Court h11s

jurisd1ctio'1 and I'd be \/ill'lng to addrcsE myself to that.
I beg your pardon?
QUES·rION:

The issue i'3n' t ra i::;ed by anyone in

the case, is it?
IIR. BORK:

Not that I know of, your Honor.

QUESl'lOll:

In order to find a repeal of the

BORK:

Tucker Act, we h4VC to be asko

to be Ucve tl1at they --

Cone;resa lmowln,:;ly insis':ed upon continued operations, knew
th ..t they might c uoe .. o~ses and for that r"'".l:lon, r·epealed

Tile i.;amc thin1; is true cf the final -cransfer
provioions .i.n Section 303.

We are asl(C<1 to believe t,1at

Congress h1owlnr;ly required a transfer it

knew mi191t

conceivably fall short of just compenoation and yet
intend~d, if that should occur, not ~o comp~nsate.
Indeed, ~here iE no reason here to imp~te any
i~plied repeal of the Tucker Act to Conr,resJ, except to
lmput1 to Concres, the de5ire not to )llY if it turned

out

34
thnt there was an ,mconi:titut1onal te.k1ng and I '1on't think
that kind of intent ever our,ht to be imputed to Con6ress
unless Congress mnltcs that 1mputat~on unavo1d~ble by specific
lanruage.
~t may be t~at Con~rcsa never even thour,ht about

the 'l 'ucker Act.

Quite likely.

• •10n't dwell on tr

'c i.uJ.ntive history because

the ler,i, lati ve history shows no more than •,hat Congress

was not thtnkine; abont the Tucker Act and Conr:rcss thought
that Section 303 ,-10uld provide adequate comoc nsation.
But if they arc tirone, ,:e think t~e ruck er Act

Now, I want to spend a moment addressinr; myself --

spea!t for them 1ere.
I hr.ve no dou t trhatevcr of the- s1.ncerity or their
\'iews and I have no doubt whatever c.S to the accuracy of
their statenent of the.it• intentions.
l3ut I object to the Jr consic.eration, the
consideration of otatement of intention on the 6 rounds t hat,

35
tc give it 11ei~ht, \iould 1:orlt a "'adical reconstruction in
the constitutional relationship 'Jet11een Congreos and this
Court.
This Court discerns legislative intent rrom the
statutes, from the debates, from the records.

It should

not look to what individual Conr;ressmcn say they intended
afterwards, wh'i.'n those intentions were never expressed to
the Senate and to the House that adoptec! {;he bill, or to
the President who si(slled it into la11.
de

if t

Tucker Ac·t iosue had been e;..plored 1.r, Congres:: or

if it had 1:le'iln laid befot e tt,e Pre..,idcnt.

'3ut even if the;re were a brtef here from a
rnajortty of both :louses, my arr;u:nent would be '·he sa'l!e.
The Constitution provides for a legis1at1vc process nnd
perhaps, if the minority -- if these vie11s ahd 1seues had
been aired, perhaps t~e minority would have convinced the
others on this issue and it iu simply •ronr; to take views
exprcsced afterwal'd-, which never ·ient through the leBislat:I. ve process envisaged by the Cons :;1 tution.
If a pt'esent scate,ent of prior leei:ilat:l.ve
intent w-:rc- riven effect, I think 11e mir;ht have to have a
different kind of ,.•-tr.l when we uent ~nto lep:ialative

As to nany ::;tatute:::, th'lt HOuld be impocsible.
I sum,e::it to you that in al:!. J.t would be lmproper.

We are

method of statutory analysis which was rejected by this
Court and by Chief Justice Marshall in Flet.2her against Peck
in the Yaz,2.o_Land Fraud case.
Now, I mal~e this arr.;ument solely out of concern
for the law and the proper processes of interpretine;
statutes.

If I am 11rong, j_f m.v submission is re;fccted, I

I submit to you that that argumen•; would not stand

The case

for an implied repealer under those circumstances would be
sec-n to be artificial, thin, un,just and wholly unpersuasive.
But the legal issues are precisely the same in that case

MR. CUTLER:

;,Ir. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The :fow Haven 'T'rustee, the cross-Appellant,
attacks the procedures of the Rail Act for the final transfers of propertie.; pursuant to the final s:,stem plan and
he argues that the:ie procedures a,,e uncon:ititutlonal under
the Fifth ~nendment.
In our brier as ~ppellee, we argue that the court
belm- co1•1•cctly rejected til:i.s attack as prematurl.l.

n

•1

that the 3pecJ.aJ. cour, has r•eje~ted the same

at·tack en :i.ts mer._ts and the statute purports to ba.r direct
review of that Jec:i.s.i.on, we aeree ,...-.i.th the Solicj.tor

39

Ge"leral and 1·•ith 'r. HorGky. l'ho wlll argue the point in
'!lore detail, that it ~•ould be

""I

appronriate exercise of

this Court's discretion to reach and decide th,se issues on
this appeal.
As to the Tucker Act issues• it seems to us it
ls really an academic point• any•,iay. because if you reach
the Tucker Act issues on erosion, whatever you decide as to
that will necessarily, we believe, decide the availability
of the Tucker Act as to the final transfer.
While it is quite true that the other •issues, as
Mr. Justice l·lhite sugr:ested, could be raised at some later
date in another three-judge court proceedin~s, some of the
damage would alre2dy have been done.
C~nr,resF a"ld the bankruptcy courts are now
prllce dinr; to carry out ·~heil· responsibility in resolving
.t-~ eastern rai

cr",:ts undi> • .;he tie;ht timetables of the

Act.
Ther-e would be a critical w~stc of time and
re oirces, it now se-ims ·.;o us, and a ,>ossible danger of
la•ge claims against the United States "or wnatc·1er P.rosion

beyond constitutional lJ.m!ts might have occurred in the
interim.
If the final tri::.n.;.fer provisions of this Act are

:a~er -- at some later date held unconstitutional by this
Court.

ljQ

now, the New Haven Trustee arP,Ucr that ~hesc
prov1s1onc arc unconstitutional on numcrou<J 1>:rou'1ds, of
which I have time to ta1<e up only three.
The firot is that the \ct reouire~ the ,ransferc
to occur before the adequacy of the consldcr tion is
judicially valued, 1hile the rei.-0 11rc(

.irovic.e i by the Act

provide the cons1•lcration and their v•cu mav be inadequate,
oo that the const1tution·,l r:1inir.n...m m::w never be received.
Tae pro•,ision foi• trani,fcr flrst and fol' Judicial
va.1.untion later is tho critical geniu'l of the nail Act in
our view because in that way, ~on;;rcss broke the procedural
log jrun for devisinr; and approvinr, a railroad reorr;anization
plan that has plagued the ICC and the Judiciary for decades,
some proci:-dure that took so

thought to be ava.il~b.e from Penn Central.
licre, 11e say t"iere is much more solid a:rnurance
ir the Rail Act and the l\,1c,:er Act.
If the special court cannot itself pro•,ine the
constitutional minir.u~ out of the over $2 b:LJ.lion of
resources that are provided under this Act, Wl adequate
remedy under the Tucker Act remains available for the
r~asons Given by the Solicitor General and ~pproved by
Judge Friendly in his speci'll cou,..t o•inio,1.

But there can't be any 1oubt that those required

11'

at Con"ress has authorized

and if the ri,...ht to sue under the 'T'uckt" Act is left intact
by the Rail Act, as the New Haven Tr•1~tee concedes, there is
jm;t no basis for calling the Rall Act itself unconst1-tutional wd the transfers that lt rc'luires, unauthorized.
y.9u~gsto1'!!! is very different, as Jud~e Friendly
point::; out at page 102 of his opinion, because there the
President's seizure of the steel plants had not been authorized, let alone been commanded by the Congress.
The New Haven Trusc;ee's second pojnt 1s that
the Ra~l Act is not a valid exercise of the bankruptcy
nower but is

conaermation wolf masque,,adinr; 1n bankruptcy

but as the

Section 77 doesn't cxhaus'~ the limits of the ban!<ruptcy

.So lonp; as the const tutionaJ mlnimurn ,:onr.ieie1•'1tj_on

merely by ;rithholdin:,; their consent to a p'an, to in;;ist

T'11rd, <;he Nei-· Haven Tr•rntee argues th:i.t Congress
cannot const:ttution:i1ly c,,:erc·· S'l it'l tankruptcy and commerc.:.'

The trustees believe that the basic concept or

As the 3ol:i.citor General has

Unlcsz and until thi:; Cou:,,t decides 11hether the
process, Hhether this ncheme is constitutional, the plain
fact is that the s:l.tuation, the rail situation in the
northeast is going to get 11orze.
On the Penn Centx·al alone, there are t 1oui:,an<ls
of miles of track that are so badly in need of r~p::tir
that trains c:m move over them only at reduced speeds, 10
miles ar ,1our.

In tre time that they have,

to decide wnethcr or not there 11as constitutioaal consideration provided in the plan for the properties that were
';o be conveyed.
The fact is that this conveyance is going to
happen and that

there is ro other course, no other

procedure by 11hich ue can find out whether or not the
process is con,titut~onal, whether the Tucker Act applies.

if you read its opinion, that the

Con&equently, if this Court -- and it indicated
that th!re 11asn't a 'l'uc!<er Act remedy, it 11ould be forced
to ope:o•ate under thE' st •tute to remove the estates from the
operation of' the Act because it •muld find that the process
of the Act 1as not fair and equi~able.
Consequently, if this Court does not provide the

57
assurance -- well, let me go back.
The special court also ::a.id it i,;ao hold in,; l ts
finr.l dec~.sion in abeyance pendtng the deciGiol'! of this
Court, as it

Wl'S

entirely proper for it to d1.

But if' this Cour·t, therefor.,, cloesn' t provide
the asourance 1;hat the Tucker Act rc-oedy is avi:lilablc,
the snecial court har. very strongly :i,1timated thai: 11hat it
u:'..11 do will be ;;o decide that the process of the Act is

not rai~ ~nd equitable and thac it will, therefore,
discharge all the railroads, including Penn Central, fro~
the operation of the Act and the Act will aoort.
So for practical reuzons, and, I thinlc, for very
good legal reasons, we strone;ly urge that you come to the
question of the Tuclccr Act and decide it.
Now, I don't think you have to get into as much
trouble wit:1 i•espect to the interim erosion problem.

That

is the second r,f the<:e problems that ::.-.,, ,:,ai;;cd by Fifth
/"nendm{'nt.
The court belo11 reach~d it on that basis by
hold~_nr, that ';her·e 1·•as such a '.'.ilcelihcod that there ~•ould

operc.tion of the estate at a loss would be

unconstitutional,

that they ought to decide 1·1hether it was appropriate to do
that and l'hether there ,.,as a 'l'uc.rnr Act re'!lecJy.
How, the conclusion of the ~ourt as to 1~hether

58
that is likely is the subject of a vast amount or writing

There is controversy over how to measure erosion.

There is uncertaint:•, to be ::mre, a., to ho11 long

All of '~ht,; ncans that i:here is disagreement, to a

59
degree, over the ,ikelihood or the de;ree of likelihood,
that there 11111 be a point or unconstitutionality.

But

everybody a,rees that it will be -- that thP.re is so,w
possibility of it and in that e•,ent, only a Tucker Act
would save the statute.
And I further agrac 11ith what Mr. Cutler said.
lf you find that the Tucker Act is available on either,
the unconstitutional erosion or on the improper talcing,
you have answered tl1e question because nobody has
suggested that the Tucker Act is available for so~c of
the takings under tne statute, but not for all of them.
l'ell, so much for the Tuclcer Act.
I don't believe that I need to add anything to
,h..,t t:1e Solicil;o1• O~neral h s ,1aid a >out 'che nature of the
are;llr.lcnt on that q ic.;tion, but - 1:1ould like 1;o malre a
couple

f comments which I t· inl· ,r,c SoJ.ic.i.tor General did

not Make and whic'l I thin!< are releva,,,-t;.
I, perhaps, do not correctly read J~dge Aldeser's
op nion below, bu:; I Gen:;;e, in this comment -- he said,
that lf he found chat there were a court of claims remedy,
it would be "Judicial legislation on

'l

gr:md, if not

arro1,ant, scale. "
I think I sem;e in that a feeling that what he
was afraid of wa~ that poss:'..bility of a court o.r claims
ju:l~,ent, if there 11ere juri:,diction in the court of claims,

60
would be huge.

W'ly, it would be hundl•eds of mlllions of

dollars or even m:n•e than that,

And that thnt was one of the

reason:c why he thought that he could not appropriacely say
that the court of clai."s jude-ment was available.
Tf' that t,; true, if there is any relev

cc to

..be qu~stion or availability of the '.i'ucicer Act as to the

siz'l of the potential 1u gmen<; again::-t the Ur-ited .St.::tes,
[ there are furt:1cr•
[they 1.re full of consicl..,rations wl1ich the Co•1rt should have
in mind.
The first .is, that::- dec'.tsion now by the Court
that a court of claims remedy 11ould be available to remedy
any inadequate compensat.i.on in the tak.i.ng by the compulsory
transfer, is in no sense, as the Solicitor General has
,;a.id, an ex post facto argwnert.
The Cono;res~ can deal with that in t,10 ways.
-:r. the firs1. place, it has to loolc at the plans
th·'t ·oma f1•om
ft

! 1 <;

l~.

the chance.

~his on~ mir;ht cau"e a very larce court of

clalms judgment and ·chey can contJ.nue to do thrit until they
ar·e satisfied tha·G 11hat the plan provides 1-1111 either
Minimize or eliminate the possibility of a Tucker Act

61
Judgment of any substantial size.
And, secondly, of course, as the Solicitor
General says, they can repeal or amend the statute.
But I think that this is a fair comment.

I believe

that it is probaoly true that this statute, llith the
combination of the power of the Congress to reject the
plans it doesn't like so that it gets the plans it wants,
combined with the sort of combination reorganizationcondemnation features of the plan, with the Tucker Act
remedy at the end, is probably the least expensive way
for Congress to prescr•1e an important national asset which
is now

no longer able to preserve 11;self.
Or, to put it baldly, I think Conp:ress would

prefer a Tucker Act remedy to the requirement that it
nationalize these railroads.
Let me '!lal~e one other comment

1111ich

is important

to us in terms o" the Tucker .'let and which the Solicitor
Gener·i::. nas not mentioned.
In the court belo11 and in t:1is Court, the
.4.ppelle":s say -- a;s llr. Cutlo:r has pointed out -- that even
if you had a Tuclrnr 4ct ..,cmedy, it real l:, is not adequate.
It is not enough.

:re

disap:ree basically 1-.ith the Appellee:; on that

point but we do have

some concern that if the Court finds

that there is a Tucker Act -- that we can maintain suit in

62
the court of cla1~s -- that we h vc- rn rdequatc remedy in
the court of clo..1.ms "1.".ld not a chintzy one.
We set out the whole ar, ur1cnt at page:; 61 to 67
in our brief, l:>ut let me illustrate the problem.
In the court belo~, in the argument before the
three-Judge court, I e;;pressed some cc".lce"n that the
Government cid not rec,or;l"lze t'li9.t 1•e hid to have an adequate

tion on, does not contemplate t'lat U~RA would be permitted,
pending the preparation or a final system plan, to authorize
the abandonment or the termination of operations and the
liquidation

of the entire ~enn Central system.

Indeed, as the special court not~d, U1RA doesn't
re-illy have th.:: po•:er all by !.t'lelf to do thc.t anyway,

Now, J.et me turn to another point.

As I have

i~dicated, th~ tr1ttees do ar,ree with the Appelleas here

that, absent a Tucker Ace remedy, thir statute cannot be
sustained.

it is also conceivable, of course,

MR. HORSKY:

I have one point like thv.t myself,

but let me take, on my premise, ·,1hat I th1nlc tne appropriate re·lief .;hould be.
I think t~c lower court, in essence, structured
it col'.'rcctly.

Ar- the Solicito1• General said, the :1rst

pa..•agrv.ph of the order j u:;t en.1 oins USRA from certifyinr
the fina~ 6ystcrn plan with 1·espec'; ~o the

eo

It permits

on 1•icht to the conclusion so ~hat the

Congrr>ss will have, whenever it has to deal with the
statute a.,,ain, the completed plan before it.
What it does is to interpose the court order,
the stop order at the last possible point before the
inexorable process of the Act •1ould transfer the property

r. c,111

tt,I) Penn Central estate.

Paragrap'1 t110 of the order rlealt 1•ith the Section

the constitutional r5.ghi;s of the creditors.
But let me come to the th:lrd one on 11hich I

66
djsac:ree with the 3olic1tor Oe,1,ral.

'111:!.s is the pnragrap,1

of the order that Jou inquired about, ,Ir . Justice Stewart,

It is possible that that sectlon 11111 nevc,r come

that 1.f' thJ.o Court finds that tnere is no Tuclt~r Act remedy,

of the ::nJunction i.;sued belo1: and the declaratory relief
of wtich it was coer8 iv-, relief declaring ~he Act, 1n
significant part, to be uncoPstitutiona~.

71
I open by tal:in,· i mnc<liate issue u i th the notion
that the task of the creditors or, for that matter, the
stockholders represented by my brother, Mr. PErr-e;.•, o;.• tile
New Haven trustee, here ae;ain, represented by Mr. /1.ue~bach,
is to force a nationalization on the Penn Central Transportation Company or to impose a collision w~t1, either
Scylla or Charybdis.
It is our task, it seems to me, to suggest that
this particular remedy, fashioned by this particular
Conv:-ess, or this par';iculr.r ,;ct of problems, represents a
reach in excesf" of the constitu~ional grasp of ti1e Congress
and we do not mean to sugge:it that a proper solution to
t~ ese prob lens is beyond tt>e wit o;.•

1

isdom of the national

lev,lslature.
The root position that we take -- and I take it
that this, now, is conceded to be the issue -- is that it
the Tucl:er Act be not ,i,vailable, the RAil Act is unconstitutional in that it furnishes no assurance that the
bankruptcy est tes uill r<>ce5.ve f1.ir coMpen:.at.lon either
fc:,_• l:be ,:,ail prope;.•~ies ult.imate 1 y conveyed or for the

-rter·ir eroslon rustained uatil such conveyance.

Furthernore, however, under Se~tton 209 of the
Act and under Section 303(B)(2) of the Act, the last
sentence, the Act specifically excludes futher review of
the compensatory mechanisms by injuncti \'e procedures so that
the l'emedy that Mr. Justice Rehnquist sup;gected as possibly
being available on some future date is attempted to be
precluded by those provisions of the \ct and most particularly, the special court is rtiven no ,11scretion undel' the
Act but to o •ctcr the conveyai1r-:is upon t'.l.c cn·tificatj_on of

court is given no

,1-:, cretion to 11ithhold those conveyances.

Th0 fifth point I 1-1ould ma.<e on the question of
rio;htnes..,, l,!r. Ju:.;tice Rehnquist, is that all the objectionable features to whlch I'll allude in a moment of t~e Act
are known and knowable no~: and

nothine; implicit in the

passa~e of time or what migh~ tr·anspire during the passage

74
of time can change the legal char·acteriutics oi' tho:,,e
features of' che Act.
And, finally, He would contend that -- and this is
close to the heart of our caae -- that the con,titutional
vice of the Act is that it imooses upon the pri'late sector,
the criditors, the stockholders, the un -;cc

U'Cd

creditors,

the entire risk cf the su~cc-~s or Paiiure of this operation

And 1 t .i.::, our proposi.;.i.on that 11hen our pX'operty,
or the property of the estate in which we have claim, is

.,

requisitioned in the public interest fol:' continued or final

I have s iid th~t tr€: , c-t p"'ecludr

a :iurance of

fair value 1nd I ,.,ould like to t€ll the Court that I propose
to address two is<, i.les.
Pirst, touc~ing li~htly -- in the li~ht of the

75
Solicitor General's conce::-ston, on 1-1:1y we believe the Act
is consti•• 1tionallY vicious in the absence of Tucker /'.ct
remedy ,md then touchir•" somc1,I-Jat more heavily, I hope, on
the question of whether the Tucl<er Act is there to rescue
the Act .
I say I' 11 touch lip;htly on these questions,
recoe;nizinr; the l'.>ossibility that "ir. Justice Stewart raised,
that the Act could be conceivably considered by this Court
sustainable in the absence of a Tucker Act because J think
the <;olici tor General's argl.i;nent on t 11e point as

quasi-

/,ppellee for the nomcnt, 11as persuasi"e anci pC'rhaps
sifficient co the occasion that in the absence of a Tucker
Ac<;, the sho1·: 1::; substantially ov~r.
nut let me touch on four characteristics of the
Act that ... t seems •:o me condemn it 1.s a constitutional
enactment.
First, there 'l!'e no provisions in the Act,

I mean,

literelly nonP. at all, that p:ro,ide fo.· payment of ';he
interj.'l' e1·os1on sustained by t'1e estc.te until such time a:;
the conveyances occu1 and ;,ie aub,,-J.t that that 1 npcse.., upon
the estates both the risk and, indeed, the very ltkcly
certainty of unco"lsti tutional er os'..on of the (•state and
of t'le claims ar;airst 'che e'>tate as ti'eir interests mip;ht
appear.
·rhe seccnd considerat .on -- and I think this is --

estate.

In o,her words, it is not contemplated by the
remedial provisions of the Act that there be anything left
over to which an estate might be entitled, but it could go
any place else to recover and the catchall, the bag at the
end of the remediation provision, the place where you get
everything that you ara entitled to -- if you don't get it
from the stock, if you don't ict it from the USRA bonds,
is in a deficiency judl_>';nent against Con :qail and nowhere
else.

This arises from no elat-cr .. te canon of cons·cruction.

T'1is arises f,-,om a fair readinl' of the statu'cory

eat j_nto the stoc;cholders' account, but it •1ill devour it .
Clearly, this record jt:stifies r1hat the reorr;anization court said and it said that, and I

quote, "The

How, a 11ord abet t fii;4.•e er sion, and I think that
i s a misnomer.

l'c use that phra:e;c in the brief.

Right noH it is happer.inp.; as we argue the case .

99
'l'h1s eros1on is cont.i.nuinR right 1101·1.

The

enforcement of Section 304(F) inexorably 1'1111 cause continued erosion

as a tr11stee characterized it today, "Huge

leases during the planning period from January 2, 19711
until the consummation of a final sys~em plan, if tha.; should
eve1' happen . "
How, how lonp; will th.is be?
Hell, we no·, !mow that it cm't be for a pcl'iod
less '·ban t,10 yea:..•s cec1.use of i;he 120-day '.?Y'.;ension.
T•Jalist~.cally, I t~ink we are talking about three
to f'i ve :,cars

0

•1d I would po:mt out that thcr._ i-:; no limit

<;o the nw-1ber of final plans Conr:resr may reject.

Indeed,

there is no as3urance that Con.,ress will ever approve a
"inal plan.
It seems to me that un.1.ess there is clear,
explicit protection against these huge, ongoing losses
which the lower court estimated -- the organization court
estimated would run from between .200 '!lillion per year, for
enc year, :'."'100 fo;.• t110 yca1•s.

md if we t«lce in 1976 as

part o" the plannin~ proce ,;s, ,600 rn:: "lior that unless there
ls c le1.r, expL.cit pro·,;ectlon a

inst those huge, ongoing

.1.osses, 1•e,;ulti'lC from the continueci, mandated Penn Central
r al.l o.Jeration., as mandated 1:-,, '30<1 ( F) that the Ac'~ '!lust be

de0lared unconsti u1t:!.0'lal.
Now, in lookinr; at tl',e Act, I would say that the

100

sug~estion in the Gover~ment hr ef that chere

is some

protection a1alnst th.is interim erosion 1f just uns..ipportable.
As the special court ha.., held,
docsn 't provide any compensaticn

Section 303 just

hatsoever for interim loss

and I ftnd no support for the contention that there is any
kind of protection or provision for compensation for the
interim los::ies.
Refel."ence is made in tne bl•iefs to Section 213
but I ·,·1oul<l point out that thls 11:rant provision of the
statute prov-l.des for a total of $85 million fo,· :111 railrcad;;

defln tl •el.1 • a' cs the

erosion.
In ora r to ~et gr:mts, vhe railroads must agree
to mo•ntain the service at pre~enc levels, so no abandonments
or djscon';inuances are at all possible to come under Section
213,

So that is clearly of no help.
And that; brings u~, then, to Section 215.

As we

look at that, we .'.'incl ~·1at Sectio'l 215 provides only for
loar~, not for

r,nts and t1er,e loan~ are restricted in their

use 'or acquis!.tion, mainter '1% ce and

No ore knows, no one can know -- ::.t is to'~aliy
unkno1·1able no,, or in the near future 1hat "'ail propertie'l
will be in th's final rvste"'I nlan.
The total <iuthorizatio"l under 215 for the loe>ns
is ~15e, million for all rnllroad3 and I thtnlc, to use the
vernacul?.r, the clincher

t½E.t the law explicitly pro-

~.!'

vides that any loan under Sectio'1 215 is and .1111 be a
chat'ee ae:ninst the e tate so that any compensation that
m:i.~h'~ be p;iven to the estate for the

ultimate tai<inll' ~:ill

'lave to be reduced by the amount of the loan.
I submit, in summary, that l'enn Central C'ompa'ly

interests already have been terribly eroded.

About a

billion dollars up to the first of the year wd being
eroded at t'ie rate of abo•i~ $200 million a year.

It has fallen to m • lot, a•,ong riy bretn,..en, to

here and the cross-appeal whicl' the :lew Haven Trustee took
in this matter with respect to the effect of the ultimate

considered premature.
Before addressing myself to those two points,
however, . 1•ouJ d like to mention brie"ly some: matte1·s 1hich

And ther'e is an anom2ly here that Jud e Friendly
was amused by.

We have the Governmeni; saying there is a

good cause of action ap:ainst the United States.

We have the

111

creditors saying there isn't a cause of action against the
United States and it comes dmm, I think, to the question
asked a few moments ago by l!r. Rehnquist.
We think -- and it is a fac'; that we may be urong-but we think we are talking about bil'ions and t1e very

could be a preceC:ent for relyinr; on the fact or Conr;rcss'

sol:i r"l .1ain:ing tr ·tee of that

;•norr;an:·.zat ion.
In 1967, barely .:ix ye1.rs uhic 11 in reore:anization ter s i::: pretty rapid, we ,ere befor<J this Court
on the question .,.hether -- and this is the title of the
case is the Penn Central 1-!ei---er cases -- •1hether in the

112
Penn Cen:,;ral r:erge:c:, cases certain Ne

llaven bondholders

were entitled to insist that their consideration be
determined before the merger could be carried out and it
\las Mr . Justice Bz,ennan, as .C recall that arp-ument, 11ho
turned to cow1sel for Penn Cent,..al and he said, "Is Penn
Central willing to pay •whatever is finally judicially
determined?"
I ma:v, at this point, point out, the ICC had
already made a determination •hic:h the c~ec itors

11

re

objec .. ine; to and when Ilr. ,Tust · cc Bz,enn,:n •u·ke<l tl>~t
quest·on, counsel for Penn Ccr.tral said, "Yee, 11e 1jll pay

"'hus

i

colloau :al tre:r s, we had an open-<,nd

trar:-action and th~ Court refusec.. to c;rant the request of
the New Hav"'n bondholde:..·s that the merger be held up.

It

said the merger can go ahead.
:low, there i:i the first mistake Conr:~ess made.
Con~ress thought because tne Court in the Penn
Central .rerr;er casc-s, ac the foundation for the New Haven
Inclusion caue::;, per itted the conveyance could be made
required i\- to be made, as"' matte~ of fuct, but before
th

cons· de1 at ion

the s ...~e under

fin'l..c y deter inec1 that t!1e:, could do

his vtatu e, the

'le don't even kno, ,ha
conveyance is

t' l .;he v~r:;

.;at t0 clea.i•lJ does that.
the

_.::,n is, 1hen the

or~ent w11en the conveyances are

113
made.
But the le. H:wcn l'1clu~ior case;; don t suy that,
nor do the Penn Cent"'.11 !lerr;er ca e:;.

That is not the case under the statute.
The next pr.ase that came before the Court --the
phase I mentioned was 1967

the Penn Central merr,er was

carried out on February 1, 196 8 and t:1e next phase to come

And what had happened was, the case a3 it c'tll\e to
the Court, based upon the ICC findings that hsd earlier been
objected to by the bond'1olders and with the approval of
Judp;e Anderson, had had a sharp turn in its form of
consideration.
Judge Ande.,.:;on said, I 1·1on' t disan:ree ;;nat the
:--tock, lndeed ma:v be 1·1or';;h $87. 50 a share, but I cannot
acrec ,hat cons ti tut-tonally,

t,]-"

c.,'edi tors arc obli,"cd now

to a ... ,:;unc tha'.; it ,.ill be worth ~37. '.30 a i:share for an
indefinite period.

Tlwrefor.e, I ,,·ill require an under-

writing for ten years that stock must at some point reach

$87. 50 so the rharcholdcrs can <set out of ~- t ·-- it would be
the New Haven sha;.•eholdP.rs '.;'1en :-iolding that stoclc -- can
r:et out.
And the court in the llew H::-.ven Inclus:1,on cases
said, that is not iood cnour,h.

It is not good enourh.

It

ju!.lt doesn't r;ive thC' .:-ssuranr:e tilat credt•;ors have in o::-der

been conveyed."
Now, the next pha!ie of that case from this point

115
on, i<; is an academic thinp; beca..ire ,.

'fhe next phase af',;er tnat decision, which
occurred in June -- June 29, 1970 -- the next phase was

would tell the Interstate Commerce Commission how he
expected them to proceed on the remcnd.
That was appealed by tl1e Penn Central Trustees.

would protect us if Section 77 Here beine: car'"ied out.

For

example, we have a Section 77 (G). thts motion that has been
pendin,.

If, in fact -- and it; seems to me that the

findinc:" that ha,•e been mad<' by che special court establish
this -- that if, in fact, wc'v~ pr,:,;sed the sta11:e where t11.ere
can be an:,· reorp.:anization of Penn Central, then there is a
cons ti tut ,.onal rir;bt to have the 77 ( G) motion p:ranted and

•.r

thei·e is that coastitutional right and it coes into

... iquidation, the equity receivers must l<e1>p those properties
in';;act and liquidate -- whether they do it en masze or
separately, they 1:ould have to pro·cect us then under the
Bankruptcy Act.

QUESTION:

That Is right.

MR. AUERBACH:

Now, as it happens, we think

constitutionally the Court mus;; consider the statute but
without the Tucker Act.

Is this a constitutional statute?

And I won't argue -- the det1ilu a•.•e :!.n MY bri f.
We think it is unconstitutional.

You don't even reach

the Tucker Act, as we see :i.t, till you have pas~ed the
point of constitutionality and Judr,e Priendly, I th:lnk,
did.

We think he

incorrect in that respect.

1;ar;

If I may, in the few m:tnutes I have ) eft, I'd
like to turn to the reasons 11hy, particularly in view of
some of the questions asked by ,Justices this ,·,ornini;.
is not premature

n01

It

to rule on the quest.ions raised with

reGpect to constitut :onality of the ultimate conve:rance,
not just the mter.i.m eror.ion and, vc1·y briefly, the Court
now l:nows the Rail Act

compc"-3 a conveyance of that

property free of lien.
The properties would be included Nithout notice
or opportunity for hearing on the part of the owners or the
judges who supervise the Trustec•3 in the Section 77
proceedin,_;s.
Tl,e Conp;ress, under 3cction 208, ha~ an absolute
rig,1t of determincecion of •::iat w.:11 go into that final
sys,ern plan by rejec'cin,c; the plans that are put to it.
Fourth, the special court ls required without

12li

notiue or opp01•tuni tv ·or heari'l

to o der the con,,eyances

provided in the final plan.
Fifth, the trustees a::-e required, cro ordered by
',;he statute to convey those propertie:i free of lien, without
any choice.
Sixth, t11e Rail Act rorbids specifically -- and I
think that l!as mentioned in response to a question from
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, forbids speci!'ically any enjoininr,
of those conveyances.
Seventh, the amounts provided under the statute
are now wi1olly known to the Court.
