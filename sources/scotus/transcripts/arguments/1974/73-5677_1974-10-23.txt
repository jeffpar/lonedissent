MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in 73-5677, Schick against Reed.
Mr. Moyer, I think you can proceed now.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF HOMER E. MOYER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
The ultimate question in this case is a very ^narrow
one.

It is whether the petitioner can ever be considered for

parole.
The relief we seek is not his release from prison,
only that he be given the opportunity to come before the
Parole Board.
The facts in this case are simple and undisputed. x
Maurice Schick, a man of some 52 years of age, has
been incarcerated just under 21 years.

The terms of his

present sentence require that he remain in prison for the
rest of his life, with no possibility of parole release.
In March 1954, he was tried by an Army general
court-martial, convened just outside Tokyo, Japan, for the
murder of a daughter of an Army colonel assigned to that post.
Following a six-day trial, at which the Sole disputed
issue was the legal sanity of the accused at the time of the
offense, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death.

Although, at various times during the course of
the trial on appellate proceedings, eight prominent civilian
psychiatrists concluded that he lacked the requisite mental
responsibility at the time of the offense, his conviction and
sentence were nonetheless approved by all military appellate
reviewing authorities, and in 1957 his case was forwarded, as
is required by statute, to the President for his review.
QUESTION:

And there was conflict in the testimony

on his capacity, was there not?
MR. MOYER:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Four Army psychiatrists testified that he did not lack the
requisite mental responsibility at the time of the offense.
QUESTION:

And there were four defendant

psychiatrists?
MR. MOYER:

At the time of trial there v?ere two

civilian Japanese psychiatrists.

He did not have the oppor­

tunity to return to the United States.

During the course of

appellate proceedings, opinions were submitted by Dr. Carl
Menninger, three other psychiatrists from the Menninger
Clinic, the psychiatrist at St. Elizabeth's, the psychiatrist
for the Baltimore court system.

All of the civilian

psychiatrists replying that he lacked the requisite mental
responsibility.
In 1960, the President commuted petitioner's
sentence to life imprisonment, on condition that he never be

5
considered for parole.
At issue here is the validity of that no-parole
provision.
We maintain that it is constitutionally invalid,, on
two separate and independently dispositive grounds.
First, it is invalid under the retrospective
application of Furman v. Georgia; and
Second, it is invalid because, in imposing the
commuted punishment of life imprisonment with no possibility
of parole, the President exceeded his constitutional grant of
authority under Article II, Section 2.
I should like first to discuss the Furman point, which
is the narrower ground for decision here.
Petitioner and respondents agree on a number of
factors that bear on the Furman point.

There is, first of all,

no disagreement that the sentence of life imprisonment with
ho possibility of parole could not have been adjudged a trial.
The only sentencing options for the court-martial were death
or life imprisonment without — with the usual parole possibil­
ities.
Second, there is no disagreement about the inextricable
relationship between the death penalty and petitioner’s noparole life sentence.

Petitioner could never have •'become

subject to his present sentence had he not first been sentenced
to death.

6

Third,, there is no disagreement that Furman v.
Georgia in validated the imposition as well as the carrying
out of the death penalty.

Lower courts, implementing Furman,

have vacated death sentences and substituted alternative
punishments provided by statute.
And, finally, there is no disagreement here that
Furman v, Georgia has been applied retrospectively.
Given these undisputed facts, the non-parole
provision of petitioner's sentence is necessarily invalid,
for it could not now exist but for the prior imposition of
the death penalty.

Had the death penalty never been .imposed,

petitioner would now be eligible for parole.
Moreover, if the Court were to uphold petitioner's
-fit

"tenr ...

'.1

,

sanction the following situation;

All prisoners sentenced to death but not executed
at the time of Furman now are serving sentences of life
imprisonment with eligibility of parole.

All except the

petitioner and one other prisoner, whose situation is identical.
Schick, who was singled out for executive clemency,
is now serving a more severe sentence than prisoners who had
been sentenced to death but not executed, and not singled
out for executive clemency.
QUESTION;

1 suppose he’s still eligible for

further executive clemency, is he not, Mr. Moyer?
MR. MOYER;

Presumably he could petition regularly

7
for additional executive clemency.

A petition was submitted,

Mr. Justice Blackmun, in 1968, and denied in early 1969.
QUESTION;

But he’s presumably better off than that

class of people who didn't get — were sentenced to death and
didn't get executive clemency, and were executed.
MR. MOYER;

He certainly was not executed.

We don't

'be3 r eve tb.ut the government 's argument draws much strength
from the fact that the government was here, precluded from
carrying out what we now know to be a constitutionally cruel
and unusual punishment.
QUESTION:

Do you know that in the case of the

military?
MR. MOYER:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, sir?
Do you know that the death penalty is

cruel, and unusual in the military situation?
MR.. MOYER:
point here..

Well, the government has raised that

The answer to that is, we submit, clearly that

it is '.constitutionally cruel and unusual,

I shall address that

in some detail momentarily.
QUESTION:

Now that I've interrupted you, as I look

'at your brief and your reply brief, I think you didn't cite
Warden v. Marrero of last term. —
MR. MOYER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.
— that the government has relied upon.

Somewhere in your argument would you touch upon that,' and let

8
us have the benefit of your comments?
MR. MOYER:

Whenever you get to it.

Warden v. Marrero involved primarily,

Mr. Justice BXackmun, a statutory question about parole
applicability for the petitioner there, and the effect of a
1970 statute dealing exclusively with drug traffickers, and
whether someone who was ineligible for parole under the prior
statute was — should be considered eligible for parole
subsequent to the 1970 statute.
The question we present here, or that is involved
here, is not,under our Purman point, a statutory question.
Our point here is that the retrospective application of the
constitutional rule of Furman must necessarily invalidate
the no-parole provision.
There was, in this case, no statutory basis for the
no-parole provision, and that point X shall elaborate on.
The result in this case that the petitioner is
serving the most severe sentence of anyone in the federal
prison system, because he was the subject of executive
clemency, is simply a perverse result.

The result — this

result is clearly contrary to the purpose and the spirit of
executive clemency, and v;e submit, under Furman v. Georgia,
cannot be permitted to stand.
And in asking the Court to invalidate this provision
we are asking simply that it rule exactly the same way as
the Supreme Court of California en banc ruled, when it was

■

9
faced with precisely this same issue.

That, ease is In re

Walker, and it’s discussed in our brief.
In responding to the Furman point, the government has
abandoned some arguments that it earlier advanced, including,
I might note, the argument that the majority of the Court of
Appeals below adopted as its rationale of decision? namely,
that the death sentence was never imposed in petitioner’s case,
because it had never been ordered executed.
Wow the government’s primary defense to the Furman
point appears to rest on the contention raised for the first
time in its brief on the merits that Furman v. Georgia does not
apply to the military at all.
This contention and the factual assertions that it
rests upon are wholly unsupportable.
In our raplv brief we have cited extensive authority,
which contradicts this new argument? and I shall not repeat
that case law here.
Let me say only in summary that that proposition is
directly contradicted by opinions of members of this Court in.
Furman v. Georgia itself, which expressly contemplate
applicability to the military.
It is also inconsistent with precedents of military
courts' and civilian courts, including this Court, applying the
Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments to the
military.

But it must be emphasised that the proposition that

.10
the government puts forward here is fundamentally inconsistent
with the entire pattern of development of military law, since
the enactment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950.
Because that pattern of growth, which has been shaped by
civilian court opinions, military court opinions, and by
congressional enactments, has consistently minimized the
differences between military and civilian criminal procedures.
yyt-j,

t“.„ government offers two factual 'justifica­

tions- why Furman should not apply to the military,

It should

first be observed that whether or not these are true, these
assertions would not serve to override contrary bank of
precedents cited in our brief.
Moreover, by seeking a factual evaluation, the
government asks this Court to open the door to jurisdictionby-jurisdiction review of the applicability of the Furman
rationale to the particular experience of a given jurisdic­
tion .
Jut, most important, the factual assertions that
the government seeks to rest its argument on are demonstrably
false.
The government argues, first, that military
discipline and special military circumstances require the use
of the death penalty.

Restated, this argument is that military

discipline is dependent upon capital punishment, or, more
precisely, dependent upon constitutionally cruel and unusual

11
punishments.
This is simply baseless.

A short answer is provided

by the military itself, for the death penalty in the military
has fallen into destitute.

It is simply not used.

When it

has been used by the military, it has been used not to further
disciplinary purposes but to punish servicemen for committing
civilian type offenses.
The fact that the United States Marine Corps has
gone for more than a century and a quarter without so much as
adjudging the death penalty at trial is, itself, conclusive
evidence that the government's claim is simply unsuppbrtable.
The government also argues that the military’
appellate structura assures that the use of the death penalty
in the military will not be random or discriminatory.
This is, first of all, precisely the type of argument
that this Court refused to hear .in the petitioners for rehearing
submitted by the States of Pennsylvania and Georgia.
Secondly, this is demonstrably untrue.
We address this point at some length in our brief,
and I shall not repeat that.
let me say only that we know that the use of the
death penalty in the military is random in the extreme.

We

know that it is used so infrequently that it cannot possibly
serve any legislative or social purpose.

We know that it's

discriminatory among the Services, for it’s conflined almost

12
exclusively to the Army.
We know that its impact is racially discriminatory.
Of the eight servicemen, executed since 1950, whose race we
know, all were black.

And, furthermore, vie know, rather

dramatically, that in the military the use of the death penalty
does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the crime.
By no stretch of the imagination can it be asserted
that the use of the death penalty in the military is less
discriminatory or less random or less irrational.
There is, in short, no basis whatever for the factual
assertions the government puts forward, and on the basis of
which the government would have this Court override a sub­
stantial bank of contrary precedents.
Our second point, and the broader constitutional
point, is that imposing a sentence of life imprisonment with
no possibility of parole, the President exceeded his
constitutional grant of authority, under Article II, Section 2.
I would like, in this connection, to begin by noting
what is not in dispute on this point.
It is undisputed, first, that the President possesses
the constitutional power to commute sentences.
It is secondly undisputed that he possesses absolute
discretion in deciding when to exercise that constitutional
power.
But it is also undisputed that there are some limits

13
to that constitutional power.

There are, admittedly, some

lesser punishments that the President cannot substitute in
the act of commutation.
QUESTION;

Was any objection made at the time of

the commutation?
MR. MOYER;

No, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

The consent

or the acceptance of the petitioner was not requested, and he,
Of course, was a man who was facing execution and was offered
some form of executive clemency, and was not in a very strong
bargaining position.
The narrow issue here is what types of "lesser
punishments may be substituted by the President, what are the
limits to the constitutional power to commute sentences.
QUESTION;

But here, Mr. Moyer, if a military — if

a man in the military were sentenced to, let us say, thirty
years and that was commuted down to twenty or ten, on condition
of no-parole, that would be equally unconstitutional, I take
it?

'
MR. MOYER;

‘
Well, the first point to note is that

a thirty-year sentence would never come before the President
in the course of ordinary military appellate review.
QUESTION;
MR. MOYER;

Only death sentences?
That's correct.

Death sentences and

cases involving flag officers, go before the President as the
ordinary course.

14
But if the particular prisoner, military or civilian,
petitioned directly from the penitentiary for executive
clemency in his case, the President certainly would have the
constitutional authority to hear that case.
Whether or not the President could commute to a
punishment of twenty years without possibility of parole
would depend on whether there is any legislative authority
for that punishment.

The basic point is that the President

may not make up any punishment that he chooses to substitute
as a lesser punishment.
QUESTION; Suppose, Mr. Moyer, the statute imposed
a flat thirty-year penalty, could the President commute that
to ten years?
MR. MOYER;

We certainly would say that, he could,

Mr. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION;

Why?

The statute doesn't authorise him

MR. MOYER;

Well, the question, the rule in the Wells

so to do.

case and Biddle v. Perovich, which require — the rule requires
that there be some legislative basis, is, as stated in those
cases, a broad rule.

The requisite legislative basis has

never been spelled out precisely by this Court.

Presumably,

it. could be present in one of three forms.
If the commuted punishment were an alternative
punishment for the particular offense, there clearly would be

no question that the requisite legislative basis was present.
QUESTION:
MR. MOYER:

I'm assuming there is no alternative.
There is none in this case.

And in the hypothetical you posit, a second reading
of the legislative basis rule in Wells might well be that
legislative basis exists where the commuted punishment is one
of common usage found throughout the Code.
And, in that case, confinement certainly is the most
common punishment? and under the hypothetical you posit the
President certainly would be able to commute in that situation.
And we do not contend otherwise in this case.
This rule obviously flows from the basic separation
of powers that the defining of criminal punishment:- is a
uniquely legislative fraction, that a ruling by this Court
that the President need not look to legislatively sanctioned
punishments would confer upon the President the authority to
devise punishments as he sees fit.
Now, the government appears not to take serious
issue with the general proposition that there must be some
legislative basis for commuted punishment.
Solicitor General, in Biddle v. Perovich,

Indeed, the
argued that very

point.
Rather, the area of primary dispute here is whether
there exists the requisite legislative basis.

We maintain

that no such basis here exists, for the following reasons:

First, the commuted punishment of life imprisonment
with no possibility of parole is a punishment completely
foreign to military law, and foreign to the Uniform Cede of
Military Justice.
Not only is it not a punishment for the offense cf
which petitioner was convicted, but it is provided nowhere
in the UCMJ.

If that sentence were imposed at a military

trial, it would simply be an illegal sentence.
Moreover, that punishment was nowhere to be found
among the civilian Federal Criminal Statutes.

When the

President, in Schick’s case, commuted his punishment, he could
point to no statute that authorized the punishment of life
imprisonment with no possibility of parole.
Thus, in Schick's case, the President not only
substituted the commuted punishment, but he devised it.
In so doing, we maintain that he exercised a uniquely legis­
lative function, a function reserved by the Constitution to
the Lagia lature.
So, in final responso to your question, Mr. Justice
Elackraun, under any reading of the rule suggested in the
earlier cases, Wells and. Perovlch, by this case, the President5
action here would not be sustainable.
Indeed, when one looks at the legislative scheme,
not only is there no authorization for the lesser punishment
to which petitioner’s sentence was commuted, but the legis-

1?
lative scheme reflects a direct — directly contrary policy,
for the parole statute, which has been a part of the federal
law since 1910, reflects a congressional commitment to offender
rehabilitation as a matter of federal correctional policy.
I would like to conclude, reserving the remainder
of my time for rebuttal, —
QUESTION:

First, the statute in Marrero isn’t

quite in line with what you’ve just said,

Now, there were

some of us .*ho didn’t agree with the Court’s holding in
Marrero, and I guess I'm struggling with if still,
MR. MOYERs

Well, the statute at issue there, Mr.

Justice Slackmun, I think the ~QUESTION: But it was a statute?
MR. MOYER:
QUESTIONs
MR. MOYER:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Bl'ackmun.
Evincing congressional policy at least.
That’s right.

That statute; however,

did not exist at the time, or a statute authorising life
imprisonment with no possibility of parole did not exist at
the time that the President acted in Schick's case.
The statutory authority that the government has cited
in their brief as justification for the President's action
here was not enacted until 1970.

There was in 1960, at the

time of the commutation, .no legislative authorisation for that
punishment.
tod it9 s our position that the action taken by the

18
President was without any legislative basis in imposing a
lesser

punishment could not later be ratified by the adoption

of that punishment.
QUESTI OH : Well,» then» are you suggesting that it
possibly could be done today, constitutionally?
MR. MOYER:

The question of whether the President

—■ of what punishments the President could commute today
would depend upon what punishments today are authorised by
the Legislature.
To hold otherwise is to allow the President to
devisa» himself» punishments for the punishment of crimes.
QUESTION:

But at least today we have the example

Mow, that
It is

And the legislative history of

statutes dealing with trafficking in drugs indicates that the
congressional intention was to confine those no-parole
imprisonment situations to that narrow category of crimes.
QUESTION:

Is that because it’s a more offensive

crime than murder, do you think?
MR. MOYER:

No.

The congressional reports there

stated that the purposes of rehabilitation in the context of
drug traffickers could be carried out only by keeping such

19
offenders within prisons, that the parole policy was uniquely
inapplicable to that situation»
I should like to conclude with just a word about the
balance of interests in this case.
On the one side, there are important considerations
favoring invalidation of the no-parole provision.

In addition

to the constitutional rules at stake, the no-parole provision
in this case is directly contrary to national penal 'and
correctional policy.
The no-parole provision is anti-rehabilitative in
"the extreme.
And, finally, the no-parole provision in this case
discriminates against the petitioner by placing him in a
special uniquely disadvantaged category, where he is serving a
more severe sentence than anyone else in the federal prison
system.
On the other hand, there are no counterveiling
government interests here at stake, for all we ask in this
case is that petitioner be given the opportunity to be con­
sidered for parole.

This balance or imbalance of interests

here 'argues strongly, we suggest, for invalidation of the
ho-parole provision.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEEs
Mr. Claiborne.

Very well.

20
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLAIBORNE?

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
I should like to begin with the last point touched
upon by my opponent? which is to say the propriety of the no­
parole condition which was attached by the President when
he commuted Sergeant Schick’s death sentence.
As Mr. Justice Blackman? I think, has narrowed the
point, my opponant is not clear whether he is saying that one
must look to the penalties of punishments provided by tho
murder statuta, hern Article 118 of the Code, or whether one
simply looks to the federal criminal law or the criminal law
as a whole, to determine the issue which he puts? which is;
can the President invent a new novel penalty punishment alien
to American law?
For the purpose of this case, we may assume — though
the Court has never so held, and it's arguable that only other
constitutional limitations apply, such as cruel and unusual
punishment -— we may assume that the President enjoys no
power to create a totally novel or bizarre penalty, which is
elsewhere unknown in the criminal laws of the United States.
But that is simply not this case.
To be sure, Article 118, the murder statute in the
military case, provides only two alternatives;

death or life

21
imprisonment v/ith, normally, eligibility for parole.
But other laws in the United States, including a
specific federal statute, do envisage life imprisonment without
parole.
So we're not in the area of a novel invention, the
creation of a new penalty, which, arguably, might present a
difficult constitutional question.
We’re dealing with a condition which is only recently
affirmed by Congress as a proper punishment in the federal
system, as Mr. Justice Blackman has pointed out.
We’re also dealing with a provision which is common
in' the laws of twenty States, and many times, often for all
life Sent ness, the eligibility for parole which is otherwise
available is denied in the case of lifers.
Nothing, therefore, extraordinary in this provision,
and therefore nothing beyond the power of the President,
Unless he’s confined to the same alternatives the judge would
be,

And of course he is not.

One need take only the example

of a judge who sentences to the statutory minimum, the result
would be that the President cannot exercise his power of —
QUESTION s

Bo you know how many times this has been

done?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Marshall, "so far as cur

’research indicates, President Eisenhower, on five occasions in
addition tc this one, commuted death sentences with a condition

22

of no parole.

One other case, it was life, the other cases

it was periods of 55 or 45 years, with no parole eligibility.
The Attorney General — Attorney General Brownell,
who wrote an opinion for President Eisenhower with respect to
these cases, indicates that President Wilson had, on two
occasions, done the sarae thing.
Of course, there was no occasion to do so before
1913, because parole in the case of a life sentence was not
the rule; in fact, was unavailable generally before 1910;
in the case of life sentences, before 1913.
So we don't expect to find a long backward history
of this.
QUESTION:

Is that all?

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Except, as I say, fir. Justice,

for the experience of twenty States, in which life sentences
are ~-

I'm interested in the federal government.

does expressly, as a matter of congressional decision, deny
parole.

Well, are there any narcotics convictions

received any clemency?
The answer is no.

Undoubtedly —

So that has nothing to do with ray point*

how many times have you had clemency without

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Well* so far as !5m aware, Mr.

Justice Marshall, six instances by President Eisenhower, two
by President Wilson.
The decisions of the President in commutation natters
are not published, and whether research more thorough would
produce other instances, I don51 know.

So far as I'm able to

say, those are the only instances.
QUESTION; Do you have any idea how many Sentences in

HR. CLAIBORNE;

Of military death sentences or of

sentences of ~~
QUESTION;

No, military sentences.

MR, CLAIBORNE;
If in.1

Military death sentences during

.v .

President Eisenhower's period in office were, at a guess —
arid it’s really a guess, because the figures are divided in
ways that don't show it too clearly — something in the order
of twenty.
.

Now, let me say finally, on this point, that there
is no statutory bar, even assuming that a statutory bar to this
•>.*£ •,

■

'

hi,.;*-'

sort of condition attached to a presidential pardon were

24
constitutionally relevant, the very statute involved here,
under the Uniform Military Code, specifically authorizes the
President to commute a sentence to such lesser punishment as
he sees fit, leaving him full sway, full discretion.
The general parole statute, as x^e indicate in

our

brief, initially had a provision which specifically says
this is no

way meant to control or fetter the discretion of

the President when exercising his constitutional power of
pardon.
Now, let me say that the relevance of this issue
is important if the Court should hold that a mandatory death
sentence passes constitutional muster.

Because

in that event

it will indeed be important to recognize in the President a
power to commute or, in Governors of States, the power to
commute any mandatory death sentence; but in at least the
most shocking oases one cannot expect that power of clemency
to be exercised if the alternative used here is unavailable.
And yet the result would be, if the alternative
were available, to encourage the commutation of death sentences
when the Chief Executive, whether of the United States or of
a State, is in a position to assure that there will be no
automatic eligibility for parole in fifteen years.

Which

does not deprive him of a later opportunity, or of his
successor of an opportunity to reconsider the matter at a
later time.

Nor, indeed, does it in this case.

25
Now, leaving that question and turning to Furman vs.
Georgia, it is said that Furman vs. Georgia has been held by
this Court tc be fully retroactive.

And it is true that in

two cases,, in Michigan vs. Payne and in Robinson vs. Fell, this
Court so characterised its prior holdings with respect to
Furman, v, Georgia.
I don't want to quibble about terminology, but it is
at least arguable that all the Court has ever held with
respect to Furman is that it will prevent the present execution
of any death sentence, no matter when imposed.
The Court has not had occasion to hold, and has not
held, that Furman vs, Georgia is fully retroactive in the same
sense as it's held Gideon vs, Wainwright fully retroactive.
For instance, I don't suppose the Court has had before
it.* but I'm tot sure that the Court has foreclosed itself
removing, if a criminal, a person should come before the Court
and says "I pled guilty out of fear of a death penalty.
Which this Court has now ruled was unconstitutional, and
therefore I want to withdraw my plea and have a trial."
That would foe fully retroactive application of Furman,
if the Court"were to afford such a prisoner a reopening of
.his' -conviction on a plea of- guilty.

And it's not ah unreal

ftypothes is.

■

^

•

There may indeed also foe civil consequences that flow
from' a full retroactive application of Furman.

I'm not sure

26
what they would be, whether they deal with life insurance
policies or other matters.

But this Court hasn't left that

question open.
Now, to say that the Court has not closed the door,
of course, is not to indicate how it ought to decide it,
now that the question may be presented.
We analyse it this way.

We say the basis of the

decision in Furman, when one puts together the opinions of
the members of the Court who constituted the majority, seem
to turn on two findings s
The first is that the public attitudes of today,
with strong emphasis on the very recent past, indicate a
rejection of the death penalty as unnecessarily cruel.
Also, the experience of the recent past in the
civilian context in the United States indicates that the
administration of the death penalty has been so random, so
freakish, no discriminatory, so haphazard, that it is unusual
and cruel to impose it or carry it out today.
To effectuate those policies, it is not necessarily
required to go back twenty years to invalidate a death
sentence which has already bean commuted fourteen years ago,
and to look to the collateral consequences of that death
sentence.
It seems to us that the approach followed in
Michigan vs. Payne is appropriate here.

Now, it's true that

27
in Michigan vs, Payne the Court declined to make any retrospecfcive application, even though all that v;as at stake was
sentence, just as here»
How, here the Court has gone somewhat further.

It

has said, We will require resentencing where there is still a
realistic alternative.

But it needn't necessarily go the

further step of undoing the commutation which was premised on
a death sentence which was imposed at a time when this Court
might not have found imposition freakish or contrary to
prevalent attitudes.
How, finally, we get to the question of whether, at
all events, Furman sher Id be applied in the military context,
I owe the Court an apology for raising this issue so late in
the day.

Part of the explanation is that in the District Court

Furman had not yet been decided when the case was in the
District Court, this Court had not yet decided Furman.
In the briefs in the Court of Appeals, my friend
invoked Furman only by analogy, that is to suggest that the
no-parole condition, for the reasons given by majority in
Furman violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause.

An

argument no longer pressed here, nor, indeed, put by the
Petition for Certiorari.
Only at the oral argument at the Court of Appeal
was it suggested that Furman had any direct application to this
case

28
QUESTION:

Court of Appeals, isn't it?

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Court of Appeals.

[Laughter.]
MR. CLAIBORNE;
Appeal.

In other places it is the Court of

I have been too far away, that's all.
Mow, even so, we should have raised the point in our

brief in our position in this Court.

We were slow in seeing

it.
It is, however, it seems to us, an important point
that ought not foe decided backhandedly in this case.
My opponent spends a great deal of time in his
reply brief proving that the cruel and unusual punishment
concept applies to the military.

Without quibbling, this

Court has indeed never held that the cruel and unusual
punishment clause of the Constitution applies to the military.
There were only four votes for that proposition in Trop vs.
Dulles, and only one Court of Appeal has directly so held.
But, for the purpose of this case, we may assume
that Article 55 of the Coda enacts the same standard for the
military, and I'm willing to treat it under that same standard.
But it does not follow that what is cruel and unusual in the
civilian context is, ipso facto, cruel and unusual in the
military system.
Cruelty is relative, war is cruel, and the reasons
underlying this Court's decision .in Furman for finding the

29

death penalty cruel and unusual may indeed not foe applicable
in the military context»
There may foe a special need for deterrent in military
conditions, and there it may foe more important to look to the
imposition of the death sentence in the area of the battlefield, which may have a very real deterrent, whatever happens
on review.
On the other hand, the freakish and haphazard
imposition of the death penalty which persuaded this Court to
hold such discretionary penalties unconstitutional in civilian
context is not so likely in the military, if only because there
are so many levels of review of sentence.

Something unknown

to the1 civil system.
First of all, the convening authority must make a
decision when referring a case whether to refer it as a capital,
case or not, a first screen.

If the court-martial having had

the case referred to it as capital, sentences precedent to the
death penalty, it must be approved by the convening authority.
After that, the case goes to the Court of Military
Review, which has again power to reduce or vary, commute the
death sentence.
Then the case goes to the Court ofMilitary Appeals,
which has no power to vary the sentence, but reviews the
conviction in light of the sentence.
But, finally, in every death sentence case, at a singl

30

level, the level of the President, we have a review of the
death sentences imposed.
So it's reasonable to suppose that with a centralized
system, and these levels of review, we are going to come out
with a patent to these less freakish to use — Mr. Justice
Stewart's terminology

than we find in so many disparate

jurisdictions all over the country and, indeed, in the federal
civilian system.
QUESTIONS

If one can accept the thesis of how it

came about that the one corporal or sergeant in World War II
was executed for desertion, Sergeant -«■ what was his name?
?

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Slovik, I believe.

Slovik, I think.
QUESTIONs

Slovik.

The fact of so many different

people with responsibility, and each one passing the buck to
the other, would lead to almost a mere freakish situation,
wouldn't it?
MR. CLAIBORNEs
QUESTION:

Well, I’m not sure that —

That's at least the thesis of what

happened in. that case, to Corporal Slovik, or Sergeant Slovik.
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Stewart, in the

particular case of Sergeant Slovik, I cannot, obviously, —
QUESTION?

I don't know the facts really, either.

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Of course there were many death

sentences imposed and executed in World War II.

QUESTIONS

But only one for —•

MR. CLAIBORNEs

Only one for desertion.

Those that were imposed for murder, one doesn't know
whether it was the murder of a commanding officer or an
officer.
QUESTION t

You say only one for desertion?'

MR., CLAIBORNEs

One for desertion, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION? That was carried

out, but there was more

than one imposed.
MR. CLAIBORNE?

There was.

There were' something over

a hundred.
.QUESTIONi

Manyf many, many imposed —

QUESTIONS" ’Well, I represented half a dosen.
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Yes.

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, you speak from. closer
experience than I do.

I do know, from what few figures-'we have,

that there were indeed several imposed, and only one carried
•

•

*.•

out, for desertion. There were many for other crime's.
Now, I must say, the other crimes were mostly rape
and murder.

Murder, one doesn't know whether that was military

or not, it could have been.
But I'm not suggesting that this Court has a basis
on which to make a decision as to whether Furman ought to
apply to the military.

32
I am suggesting that there are sufficient differ­
ences so that the Court, ought to hold its hand , and if it
reaches that issue, which it reaches only if it first holds
that Furman would retroactively apply to this situation?
then you have to decide whether it applies to military at alio
In that event, we think the record far too bare,
the facts, figures, other indications as to the deterrent
value, as to the actual experience, are rot explored in this
record.

And the Court ought have more to go on before

reaching that very important step.
Accordingly, should the Court go so far in the case,
we think the appropriate course would have to be a remand to
the District Court, with an opportunity for presentation of
evidence and of statistics, which would furnish that Court,
the Court of Appeal, and perhaps ultimately this Court, with
a concrete record on which to make that important decision.
How, we recognise that this is a hard case.
We do want to emphasise that it is not our position
that the President, once he imposes this sort of condition,
does so irrevocably.

It is, as Attorney General Brownell

mads clear in his advice to President Eisenhower, open to
that President or to any of his successors to vary the
condition, and it may well be that circumstances would
justify it in this case.
QUESTION:

In other words, in that view, the

33
President is a continuing de facto parole body,, is that
your view?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.

And it is open to the President, perhaps especially so in the
military context, in which the President serves also as
commander-in-chief, to appeal to him and perhaps that procedure
in the military doesn’t require going through the pardon boardj
1 really can’t speak too authoritatively about that.
QUESTIONS.

But didn't Mr, Moyer say that there had

been an effort in recant years?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Well, I frankly was unaware — I

think he said 1968.
QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE;

It is — I’m not for a moment

suggesting that. I have any basis on which to encourage the
hope that such an application would be successful.
On the other hand, six years having gone by, there'&
•no" reason not to reapply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Claiborne,

Mr. Moyer, do you have anything further?
You have about, six minutes left

34
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOMER E. MOYER? ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOYER;

Mr. Chief Justice? I have only two brief

points in rebuttal.
The first is that in asking this Court to hold that
the retroactivity of Furman does not reach petitioner's
sentence, the government is asking this Court to create a
new strand to the doctrine of retroactivity, a strand that
would held that some retroactive constitutional rulings are
retroactive for some purposes but not for others.
QUESTION;

Well, your proposition is based on the

assumption that we decided this issue in about enough scope
to embrace the military, isn’t it?
MR. MOYER;
QUESTION;
MR. MOYER;

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
That’s your starting point.
That’s right, and that’s the second

point that I would like to address.
Respondents suggest the appropriateness cf a remand
and an evidentiary hearing in this case.

We would suggest that

that is uniquely inappropriate.
First, whatever facts might be adduced at an
evidentiary hearing, they would not suffice to overturn the
contrary precedents in military and civilian courts.
But, moreover, we know, from the facts before this
Court now, that there are no. facts that could be adduced that

35
would justify the position or the propositions that the
government puts forward.
Let me deal quite briefly in the specifics of the use
of the death penalty.
First, the idea that the death penalty is a
deterrent must necessarily rest upon the reasonable expectation
that that penalty will be used.

In the military there is no

basis for that form of expectation.

And certainly hot in the

case where military discipline is at stake.
There were 102 servicemen executed during World War
II, 101 of those 102 were convicted of civilian type offensess
rape and murder.

Only one was executed fc-? having 'committed

a military type offense.
All 12 of the servicemen executed since 1950 committed
civilian type offenses.
But even if you accept the government's hypothesis
that there is some deterrent value to the imposition of the
death penalty, without its ever being executed, we knew that
that doesn’t sustain their position here, because the Marine
Corps has not even adjudged the death sentence since before
1849,

The Navy has adjudged it five times in that century and

a quarter.
QUESTIONs Well, I suppose it would be arguable that
that demonstrates equally, or perhaps no more than, that the
discipline in the Marine Corps is much better, and that the

36
quality and caliber of the people is higher, as they
traditionally claim.
MR. MOYER:

I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice, in the

same way it could be argued that the more random and the more
freakish the imposition of the death penalty is, the more
that shows that the deterrent effect is created by the
death penalty.
QUESTION;

How many death penalties did you say

were entered?
MR. MOYER;

There were 102 that wore executed

during World War II.
All but one were servicemen who had been convicted
of murder or rape.
QUESTION; Well, you mean carried out?
MR, MOYER;

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Because I know of one incident where

51 were .sentenced to death, but they didn’t die.
MR. MOYER:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

There were more that were imposed.

MR. MOYER:

Oh, yes, indeed? no question about that.

I have nothing further.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:50 p.m., the case was submitted.]
