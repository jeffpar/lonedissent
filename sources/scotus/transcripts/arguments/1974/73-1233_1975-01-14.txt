PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1233, National Labor Relations Board versus
Sears, Roebuck and

Company.

Mr. Friedman, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice.

May it Please the Court:
The question in this case, here on a writ

of

certiorari to the Court of Appeals from the District of
Columbia Circuit, is whether the Freedom of

Information

Act requires the disclosure of certain documents generated
by the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations
Board, so-called "Advice and Appeals Memoranda" which relate
to the prosecution of unfair labor practices before the
board by the General Counsel.
And in order to put the issue in context, I’d like
at the outset to describe briefly the procedures that are
followed within the General Counsel's office in deciding
whether or not to prosecute an unfair labor practice charge
before the board.
As this Court is aware, the National Labor Relations
Board itself has no authority to bring an unfair labor

practice charge.

It can only act in response to a charge

that has been filed with it.
If a charge is filed and any person can file a
charge, then the General Counsel, if he wishes to, may pro­
secute the charge but only in response to someone else
bringing the matter to the attention of the board formally
may the board issue an unfair labor practice complaint.
Now, the General Counsel of the board, who is a
Presidential appointee, serves two functions in connection
with the handling of cases before the board.
First, he is the one, when a complaint has been
issued, who prosecutes the case before the board.
Secondly, he has final authority to determine whether
or not a complaint should be issued and that is, if, after
examining a case, the General Counsel decides not to issue
a complaint, that is the end of that case as far as the
board is- concerned.
QUESTION:

Wholly unreviewable.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Wholly unreviewable, held by a number

of courts to that effect.
Now, the General Counsel in turn has relegated to
the board’s regional directors, of whom there are some 30-odd,
the authority initially to process unfair labor charges.
When a charge is filed with one of the regional
directors, he investigates it.

He ordinarily will interrogate

witnesses, look at documents and so on and after he has
completed his investigation, there are three possible things
he may do.
First, he may conclude that there is nothing
here that warrants the issuance of a complaint and he
decides not to issue a complaint.
Secondly, he may conclude on the basis of his
investigation that there is enough here to warrant the
issuance of a complaint and he issues the complaint.
Third, he may submit the matter to the General
Counsel’s office in Washington for advice on whether or not
he should issue a complaint.
The General Counsel has put out instructions to
the regional directors that they are to refer two categories
of cases to Washington for advice.
One, cases that present novel or complex problems
or, two, cases that involve certain issues which the
General Counsel has specified should be submitted to him in
Washington in order to assure a uniform prosecutorial
policy with respect to these cases.
Now, when the General Counsel receives from the
Regional Director a request for advice, the matter is sub­
mitted to something called the Office of Appeals in the
General Counsel’s office where the case is thoroughly and
carefully reviewed by a number of people and this review

6
process culminates in something called an ’’advice memorandum”
in vfhich the General Counsel sometimes acts himself, more
frequently acting through the man in charge of the Office
of Advice, advises the regional director on whether or not
he should issue a complaint.
These advice memoranda, the General Counsel gives
the reasons for his decision, discusses the evidence of the
case, analyzes what precedents and if the advice is that a
complaint should issue, he generally gives the theory upon
which he believes the case should proceed.
Now, although the representative in examples
included in the record of advice memoranda contained nothing
making any reference to the possibility of settlements, the
report — the two reports in this record presented by the
practice and procedure committee of the Labor Law Section
of the AmericanBar Association on which Sears relies very
heavily and in

one of those reports set forth at page 71 of

the Appendix, the committee, which represents, of course, the
experts in this field, both on the labor and the management
side, recognizes that not infrequently these advice memoranda
will refer to settlement possibilities.
It is in the middle of page 71 and the statement is
"The response to the region will sometimes include specifics
with respect to the kind of settlement or other action and
will set forth the theories upon which such course of action

7
Is based,” and I stress that because the ultimate question
in the case is what these things are.
statement of legal position or do they

Are they just a
involve something

more?
They basically reflect the strategy, the litigation
strategy that the General Counsel has recommended be followed
and we think the fact that they fefer to settlement
negotiations and suggest a basis upon settlement to us is
very clear evidence of that.
Now, if the regional director should decide not
to issue a complaint, either because of the advice he has
received from the General Counsel or because his own
investigation indicates that a complaint is not appropriate,
then the charging party has the right to appeal that
determination to the General Counsel.
The matter is then similarly reviewed except by a
different office by something called the "Office of Appeals,"
If the Office of Appeals upholds the regional
director's determination, It so advises him and the parties
with a rather brief statement giving the reasons for his
decision.
If, however, the regional counsel is reversed
and the General Counsel concludes that a complaint should
issue, they then prepare something called an "Appeals
Memoranda" and the Appeals Memoranda is similar to the

8
Advice Memoranda in that it, too, describes the case,
suggests theories, gives the reasoning of the General Counsel.
Now, it is these two categories of —

QUESTION:

To the regional director.

And to nobody else?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

To nobody else.

These are the two

things they want to see.
QUESTION:

I know that.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, this is an internal document

in which the General Counsel explains to the regional
director why he thinks the case should go forward, suggests
legal theories of the case, discusses the evidence, may
again refer to settlement

negotiations and will discuss the

applicable board and the court precedents.
I'd like to just make one other point here because
the claim is that somehow these appeals memoranda represent
the law of the General Counsel.
They are not the law of the General Counsel.
The General Counsel makes no law.

All he does is

applies the law as the board and the courts have developed
it.

He is the prosecuting arm — prosecuting arm of the

board in handling of these unfair labor practice -QUESTION:

There is an appeal only in the event

MR. FRIEDMAN:

He advises the charging party —

has decided not to issue a complaint advising the charging
party — I believe it is within ten days that he may appeal
to the General Counsel.
QUESTION:

Uh huh and then how is that appeal

taken?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is a written piece of paper

that is sent to the General Counsel indicating why the
charging party believes that a complaint should issue in
this case.
If the charging party wishes to, he may have the
opportunity to argue orally before the General Counsel’s
office in Washington.

But you get one side from the

The charged party may have a wholly

QUESTION:

And the regional director, if and only

if, he decides with or without having sought advice from
Washington, not to file a complaint, then and then only is

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

And It is preliminarily an

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Later, there may be or is an opportunity

QUESTION:

And how long a process is this?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Oh, it might be —

In any given case.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

— a week, two weeks.

It would vary,

I suppose, depending on whether there is going to be a
hearing.

What may sometimes happen occasionally when the

case gets to the General CSuri'sel's office, it may be sent
directly to the General Counsel himself and he may consider it.
And let me say that this is — this is exactly, if
I may come to this right now, this is exactly what happened
in this case — in this case.

Then, if the — if the General Counsel's office
upholds the decision of the regional director not to —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Issue a charge.

— file a complaint, then what?

13
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Then a notice to that effect is

sent to the charging party and to the regional director and
that is the end.
QUESTION:

That is the end of it and there

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There is no —

There are no papers there In that kind

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There are none.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There are none, other than the

letter, which is a public document because it is sent to
the parties.
QUESTION:

Just a notice.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

There is no other thing.

So it is only in the event that the

of it, to the regional director.

Authority and he has delegated it

to the regional director.

— authority to decide whether or not to

file a complaint after a charge has been filed.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is right.

That is right and he

has delegated to the regional director the initial processing
of these complaints.
QUESTION:

The Initial processing.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Thank you very much.

QUESTION:

I believe the General Counsel has a

tenure of office that is fixed by statute, does he not?

15
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Four years, Mr. Chief Justice.

And he can only be removed for cause,

is that not so?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I believe so, yes.

Let me just come back, if I may, with one more
thing to describe a little bit about these appeals memoranda
and the advice memoranda here.
All that they really decide — all that the
General Counsel is deciding when he either recommends in
the advice memorandum when he authorizes a complaint or,
at the appeals stage in the appeals memorandum when he tells
him to go ahead and file it, is that this is a matter that
warrants presentation to the board.
He is not deciding that there is a violation and
that is shown rather explicitly;in this record there are
at least three examples in the advice and appeals memoranda
and also in two letters sent to counsel for charging parties
in which it is explicitly stated that this is a matter that
warrants passing on by

the board.

Let me just refer the Court to two of these and
then I will cite the others — at page 191 is an advice
memorandum which ends up that "Authorization of complaint
was warranted to place the issues of the case before the
board," and then at page 206, which is an appeal memorandum,
in the second full paragraph under "Reason for action," it

16
said* "Issues were raised with respect to various Issues
which warranted board determination on the basis of record
testimony."
Another example of that'is at page 211 of the
record and then at page 32 and 199 of the records letters
sent by the General Counsel to 'counsel for the charging
parties.
Now, let me come to the facts of this case very
briefly.
In this case, Sears filed —

Sears, Roebuck, the

Respondent, filed with the regional director a charge
against a union alleging that the union had refused to
bargain.

That alleged refusal to bargain, whether there was

a refusal to bargain, turned upon whether Sears had properly
withdrawn from a multi-employer unit prior to the time that
bargaining began.
This is a matter of some dispute within the board.
There is a lot of board precedence on this, a lot of litigation
on this as to just when an employer or a union may withdraw
from multi-unit bargaining.
The regional director referred this case to the
General Counsel for advice.
The next thing that we know by the record is that
the regional director advised Sears that he was not filing a
complaint in the case.

17
Sears then appealed this to the General Counse3.
and the General Counsel reversed and advised Sears that a
complaint i*ould be filed stating, and it is again coming
back to what I said a minute ago, that this case raised
issues warranting board determination.
That is at page 32 of the Appendix.

And then the

regional director subsequently issued a complaint.
Now, prior to the time that Sears appealed

from

the regional director's refusal to issue a complaint to the
General Counsel it requested the General Counsel t0 furnish
it, under the Freedom of Information Act, with three things.
First, the advice memorandum that the General
Counsel had submitted to the regional director advising it
not to issue a complaint in this case.
Secondly, all advice and appeals memoranda
relating to the same subject.

That is, the timeliness of

employer withdrawal from multi-employer bargaining units,
all of those appeals and advice memoranda rendered within
the past five years and, third, an index or a digest to the
advice and appeals memoranda.
What it stated was, it needed this information in
order to successfully prosecute its appeal to the General
Counsel.
The General Counsel refused to furnish these
memoranda under the Freedom of Information Act, relying on

exemptions 5 and 7 of the Act which I will discuss shortly,
and also saying that these memos

were not a final disposition

of the case, but were merely guides to the regional directors
on how to prosecute the case.
v

Sears then filed this action in the District of

Columbia District Court to obtain this information.
While the case was pending before the District
Court, the General Counsel of the Labor Board announced
that, as a matter of discretion and not because it was
required by the Freedom of Information Act, that he was going
to make available to the public copies of all of the appeals
and advice memoranda in so-called "Closed cases," that is,
cases where the board proceeding had been completed.
He stated he was doing this; in order to provide
the public and the labor bar with further Information as to
how his office was functioning.
Now, both sides in this case moved for summary
judgment.

The District Court granted Sears' motion and

entered a rather broad order set forth at pages 9 to 10 of
the record which directed the board's general counsel to
provide all advice and appeals memoranda.
Sears had broadened its claim in its complaint so
we were directed to produce all advice and appeals memoranda
for the past five years, including anything incorporated by
reference in those things.

19
That is, if, for example, as we read the order,
if the order directed them to produce an appeals memorandum
and the appeals memorandum said, "For reasons stated in the
regional director’s memorandum, we conclude we xd.ll not
authorize a complaint in this case,” that would have to be
produced.
They also — it also said that where it used
some vague language, such as in the circumstances of this
case, the

General Counsel would have to explicate that and

explain exactly what was meant.
Now, let me say that this kind of thing and the
circumstances of this case as set forth in the reasons
given in the appeals memoranda or the request for advice
from the regional director — these are just kind of shorthanded phrases within the informal administrative procedure
that is followed, what is done in this situation is the
parties, the General Counsel is dealing with the people in
the regional director’s office in the region.

They are

familiar with these things.
QUESTION:

Are you saying, Mr. B’riedman, that

the District Court required the General Counsel to prepare
rr.aterial that wasn’t in existence in order to —•
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It may — it may, Mr. Justice,

because vrhen they — what he said was "That Defendants
produce explanatory material including existing documents

It

QUESTION:

Where is this?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Page 10a of the Petition for

Certiorari where the District Court's opinion —
’’Defendants produce explanatory material including
existing documents in those instances where advice or
appeals memoranda rely upon the circumstances of the

case

or some other vague and imprecise reference without
delineating what those circumstances are except where they
can demonstrate that the documents are exempt under the Act,”
which it seems to us just leaves the thing very far-reaching
because —
QUESTION:

When you say, "Including the existing

documents,” the inference is perhaps of more than existing
documents.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It may well be.

For example, if

some of the basis for the action of the General Counsel’s
office was In discussions,

informal discussions or telephone

conversations they had with the people in the regional office
which sometimes happens, I assume they would have to — unless
they could show that this was exempt — they would have to
make this available.
They might have to reduce to writing some of the
things that they had — some notes that they had to make this
into a formal memorandum.
As the Court of Appeals summarily affirmed on the

21
basia of the decision of the District Court and also cited
its opinion in the Grumman case, which is another Freedom
of Information Act case to be argued immediately following
this case.
Now, in the Freedom of Information Act, what
Congress has done is to provide three different categories
of information that are subject to production.
First, there is one category which has to be
published in the Federal Register.
Then there is another category consisting of three
components which has to be produced and indexed.
Finally, there is a third category of identifiable
records which just have to be produced.
But then the Act goes on in subsection B and lists
nine specific categories to which it says the Act does not
apply.

Now, our submission to this Court is that three of

those exemptions cover this material and if we are right in
that, if we are right on any one of those, if any one of
those exemptions covers this material that, of course, is
the end of the case.
You never have to reach the argument upon which
Sears relies so heavily that these documents are compre­
hended within the three subeategories which are required to
be published and indexed and so I will address primarily —and perhaps exclusively depending on how the time runs, the

22

reasons why we think the exemptions cover this and we have
discussed the other issues fully in our brief.
Now, our principle reliance and our reliance in the
lower court was on Exemption Number 5 which was before this
Court two terms ago in the Mink case which provides for inter­
agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which vrould
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in
litigation with the agency.
There is no question these are intra-agency memor­
anda.
This provision of the Act, I might add, is on page
l4a of our Petition for Certiorari and also will be found at
;

page 56 of our brief on the merits.
QUESTION:

I take it, then, that the government

does not contest the assertion that the General Counsel is
an agency?
MR.. FRIEDMAN:

We conceded that — \ie conceded that

in the District Court, Mr, Justice,
QUESTION:

And still do.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

If I may say, vie don’t concede it but

v;e don’t contest it.
QUESTION:

So we treat the General Counsel separately

from the board for purposes of this case.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

For purposes of this case, although

if we didn’t raise anything because we conceded in the District

23
Court — I think an argument could be made that he Isn't.
We are not making that here.
QUESTION:

So is your argument ,}u3t simply on the

exemptions rather than on the earlier part of the Act?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, we argue first the exemptions

and then we argue the earlier part of* the Act.
But the distinction between them is, if we lose on
the exemptions, under subparagraph three all we are required
to do is to produce them.
On the other hand, if they come within any of the
three subcategories of the earlier part of the Act which
we don’t think apply, we are required not only to produce
them but also to index them so that our reliance is, first
we say we don't have to produce them because they are
exempt.
Secondly, we say if we do have to produce them,
if we do have to produce them, they are not under subpara­
graph two, which are the three categories, but under subparagraph three vrith respect to which there is

no indexing

required, but we —
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, I gather any question

whether the General Counsel is an agency would have been

made in the adjudication of cases, statements of policy and
interpretation —QUESTION:

Now, do you say that they are not?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

those three, that is right.
QUESTION:

Any of those three.

QUESTION :

But you concede that they are

25
Identifiable records?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:
opinions?

Yes.

Yes, we do.

And you say that they are not

I suppose you must mean that the General Counsel

has no final opinions because he doesn't adjudicate.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

He doesn't render

final opinions because he doesn't adjudicate.

These are

not interpretations which the General Counsel has adopted.
QUESTION:

Why isn't the rejection of a complaint

an adjudication?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, because we think that, as

used in the Freedom of Information Act, what Congress was
referring to was a determination of the legal issue and the
General Counsel has not determined the legal issue when he
refuses to issue a complaint.
QUESTION:

Well, is it an adjudication under the

Administrative Procedure Act?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It might be.

It might be but we

would contest it and —
QUESTION:

Well, Is It or isn't it?

You don't

"adjudication" in the Freedom of Information Act should have
the meaning it has in the Administrative —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think in determining whether

something is an adjudication under the Freedom of Information

Act you have to look at the purposes of that statute, you
have to look at the purposes of that statute.
QUESTION:

So your answer is, no, it doesn't have

the meaning that it does in the Administrative —
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I would say, not in all cases.

And we also think, finally, that these are not
administrative instructions to staff because the legislative
history shows that administrative instructions and"adminis~
trative instructions" was put in there, that specific
modifying word was put in there to make it clear that this
dealt with administrative matters and not instructions
relating to law enforcement or litigation.
Let me just come to what the Court said in Mink
about Exemption 5.

What the Court said in Mink in Exemption

5 was that there Congress incorporated the special and
settled rule that confidential intra-agency advisory opinions
are not privileged from inspection and

that the question in

each case is whether production of a contested document would
be injurious to the consultative functions of government that
the privilege of non-disclosure protects.
You also said that Congress in this exemption was -—
intended to permit discovery of purely factual matters
appearing in government documents that could be separated out
from the' non-factual.
Now, we think that thase documents —- we think are

27
the essence of government's consultative functions.

This

is the way within the General Counsel's office advice is
sent out to the field on whether to prosecute a case, how

They

They are inextricably intertwined because
case is tied with the facts.

Indeed, when the people in the General Counsel's
office marshal the facts to explain the facts, that itself
is the essence of a lawyer’s job.
He looks at the facts, decides how to present the
facts in the way that will be most effective.

It is really

either is or is certainly analagous to the lawyer's work
products which traditionally is not available in discovery.
And, indeed, I think it is very revealing at
page 131 of the record in this case that Sears itself
apparently recognized that these documents are being sought
for something more than just information.
They wanted them, as they said, in order to help
prepare to litigate this case, first to take the appeal and
then to litigate it before the board.
At page 131 a letter in which Sears requested the
General Counsel to extend the time for its hearing, stated
that HWe need this material to prepare witnesses prior to

28
the board hearing."
Well, any lawyer would be delighted if he could
have access to the material in his opponent’s files showing
how his opponent was going to try the case, what his strategy
was, how he viewed the evidence, how he would marshal it.
That, we submit, is precisely the kind of information
that Congress intended to protect against disclosure

in

There have been recent amendments

attempting to clarify it but none of the recent amendments
deals with Exemption 5S I may say, Mr. Justice.
It is a difficult thing and I think basically you
have got to look at the purpose of Congress in these amendments, that Congress recognized that there was a strong public
interest in making things public but also that government
couldn’t operate in a fishbowl and that in certain instances
it was important to preserve the confidentiality of govern­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERARD €. SMETANA, ESQ.
ON BEI-IALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SMETANA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Please the Court:
I think in beginning I would like to spend some
time in responding to Mr. Friedman's arguments.
But perhaps I ought first to give the Court just
a basic outline of what our position is and that is, it is
our position, as opposed to the position of the Solicitor
General that if the documents in question fall within Two
A, B or C of the Freedom — and are required to be disclosed
as either final opinions in adjudication, statements of
policy or administrative instructions affecting staff, then
you never

reach the exemptions because they are — the

exemptions insofar as the kinds of documents involved here
are mutually exclusive for the reason that, yoir

onor, if,

in fact, these are declarations of substantive law — and,
obviously, I have to develop that whole point — and if
this is an agency, which has been conceded, and these are
the declarations of this agency, then it would be contrary
to the very basic principles of the Freedom of Information
Act to permit an agency, simply by passing documents back
and forth, to create the very kind of secret law which the
Freedom of Information Act was designed to avoid.
QUESTION:

Do you think that the Freedom of

30

Information Act would reach the communications between a
division of the Department of Justice or the Labor Board and
the Solicitor General’s office?
MR. SMETANA:

Your Honor, in answer to that question,

I must confess to begin that in terms of the specifics of all
of the various agencies that might or might not be affected
by

a

decision here, I cannot speak for.
But I can answer it in this fashion, that the

record does reflect what type of documents are involved here
and the kinds of documents which were admitted, the documents,
the procedure that we followed here was before the Mink case
but we agreed upon representative samples of the

kinds of

documents.
After 12 weeks of going through the documents in
the General Counsel’s office and the advice memos were in fact
documents that he gave us and the appeals memos were documents
that we found.
These very documents, however, do not deal with the
kinds of information that Mr. Friedman speaks of, perhaps
except on rare occasions,
They do not speak of trial tactics.
They do not speak of settlement.
They do not — they — they do one thing.

They

inform the public or the parties, as is presently the case,
as to what the law is.

31
Now, I would submit in answer to your question,
your Honor, if the Justice Department, as a prosecutorial
agency, were to inform people as to what the law is — in
other words, only the basis of their proceeding, not the how,
not the witnesses, not how they were going to try the case,
that is what is involved here and it may be that in the
nature of Justice Department or the other

agency pro­

ceedings, the instructions or the trial tactics or the
names of witnesses or the facts may be so intertwined that
for that reason, those agencies’ documents may not have to
be produced and may fall under one of the exemptions.
But in this case where the documents are pure
and pristine questions of law and where the District Court
judge quite correctly and affirmed by the Court of Appeals
struck and said that settlements discussions, names of
witnesses or anything else that is exempt can be eliminated
from the documents and they can in the nature of these
documents, then, I submit, that we don’t have a problem in
terms of 'the varied kinds of fears that Mr. Friedman quite
properly sets forth.
QUESTION:

What if the United States Attorney, say,

in the District of Missouri, writes back to the criminal
division of the Justice Department and gives him a set of
iacts and wants to know whether to go ahead and maintain the
prosecution and the Criminal Division replies, well, the

32
Eighth Circuit, the way it is constituted now, isn’t apt to
go for this

kind of a case.

We think maybe the Seventh Cir­

cuit might be better so the way the law stands in those two
circuits, wait for one to come up in the Seventh Circuit.
MR. SMETANA:

I would submit that those are the

very types of consultative functions that would be exempt
r under Exemption B5.
QUESTION:

Even though their discussion strictly is

of legal points.
MR. SMETANA:

Well, because the very nature of the

hypothetical you give me, your Honor, is one that deals with
instructions, which are not involved in this case.
This case would be a situation where the Attorney
General or the U.S. Attorney would not not — in Washington
or wherever — would not give any instructions with respect
to how to try the case, which circuit is better, but only as
to what his view of the law is and with respect to anything
else that would remain confidential and not be subject to
disclosure.
QUESTION:

I had understood your position was --

generally, on the law, that if a document falls under the
definition of 552, 2, A, B or C, then it is produceable
and you don't even get to the exceptions.
MR. SMETANA:

That is correct,

Oh, only because — I wouldn’t say that is true.

33
QUESTION:

Wells let me Just follow that up* if

you say that is correct, then, of course, explain it, but
my brother Relinquish*s example, it seemed to me, gave you,
in his hypothetical, a document that probably would fall
under either B or C and yet you conceded that the exception
would be applicable.
MR. SMETANA:

For this reason, your Honor.

think we read A, B and C as being —

I

as referring to that

portion of a document that is the final opinion or the
substantive law.
Mr. Justice Relinquish's example, I would submit
that if those portions were included in the document that
also talked about what the law was, then those portions of
the document would not be A, B or C, they would merely be
Identifiable, as Mr. Friedman says, under 3 and then they
would be exempt under one of the exemptions B5.
QUESTION:

What the law is is as available to you

as it is to the Criminal Division if you are only talking
about published opinions of the Courts of Appeal,
MR. SMETANA:

What we are talking about here, your

Honor, as opposed to published opinions, are the — are the
secret law, if you will of the General Counsel of the
National Labor Relations Board.
And I call — I call your honors' attention in
that regard particularly to the Quarterly Report of the

3
General Counsel,
Now, the General Counsel — and this is on page
150 of the Appendix — now, the General — and it goes on and
on.
Now, every quarter — in other words, four times a
year, he selects certain cases, advice and appeals decisions,
that he believes that it would be helpful if the public knew
how he was proceeding.
It is interesting to note that those cases cited
in the Appendix are cases which are open cases, cases in
which he is proceeding.
In fact, they go to the very point Mr. Justice
Rehnquist made.

He has been able, through the device of

publication, although selective publication, those cases
that he chooses, by simply limiting the announcement as to
what the law is and it is also significant that the General
Counsel has been called — I mean, he has the unreviewable
discretion to proceed or not to proceed and this Court is
only too familiar with the complexities of the labor law
and in exercising those decisions, he essentially shapes the
law because by not proceeding, he makes as much law as he
does by proceeding.
Now, Mr. Friedman called your attention to the fact
that —
QUESTION:

Well, the decision to proceed is going to

35
be made by the board, I take it.
MR. SMETANA:

Well, but It is a separate agency.

I call your Honors’ —
QUESTION:

That isn’t what I asked you.

The law would be made — where a complaint is
filed, the law is ultimately going to be made by the board.
MR. SMETANA:
QUESTION:

Yes, there is no ~

Not by the Counsel.

MR. SMETANA:

— no question.

In that situation

the law is ultimately made.
However, If he was in error —
QUESTION:

What you are really saying, when he

turns down something you say he makes law but he may have
reasons for turning them down.

No doubt he does.

And you

call those reasons law.
MR. SMETANA:

That is correct.

But I would also

submit, your Honor, even when the decision is to proceed,
he makes law because in the nature of the way this agency
operates, more than 90 percent of the cases are settled and
so that even after he decides to proceed, the case will be
settled based on the theory of which the General Counsel
has proceeded.

It never gets to the board.

Some cases, some settlements are reviewed by the
board but most of them are informal in nature and are not
reviewed by the board and I also would like to call your

36
Honors’ attention, Mr. Friedman made a statement that when
there is a decision to proceed after this appeals process he
talked about., there is never a memo.
Now, it is admitted that there is rarely a memo
but I think a very good case in point is the Appendix to the
Chamber's amicus brief in this case.
That is about a 20-page opinion of the General
Counsel on a case where he is dismissed on appeals and —
QUESTION:

Well, do you think his — did you think

the General Counsel's refusals are adjudication?
MR. SMETANA:

Yes, your Honor, they are adjudications

for the very reasons stated in your opinion this morning in
the ITT case.
This is — they are first of all decisions — they
are first of all decisions made not within an agency as the
[?]

Ten Cay proceeding was in that situation, but this is the
Agency and more importantly, on page 15 of the slip opinion
in that —
QUESTION:

Well, they ought to be reViewable, then,

I take it.
MR. SMETANA:

Well, that is not before this Court

I would think they would be, but that is my personal

view and not the view of anyone else* that I am aware of.

MR. SMETANA:

The state makes them unreviewable.

However, there was a statement in Mr. Justice Douglas'
dissent in the Lockeridge case that indicates this Court
has never passed upon that and there are decisions of the
D. C. Circuit and other circuits that indicate that they
might be reviewab.le on an abuse-of-"discretion basis.
QUESTION:

Well, if there are adjudications under

you don’t need the Freedom of Information Act to

require that it be made public.

The APA requires

the

findings of fact, conclusions of law.
MR. SMETANA:

Well, your Honor, the fact is that

they haven't been and, in fact, we are -— we are one of the
very few people who have gotten him to make them public.
I am a member of that APA committee that has been
working for ten years, that Mr. Friedman

spoke about, that

are trying to get these matters produced and it is the
position of the APA that they are public and are the law
and we haven't been successful.

MR. SMETANA:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That is correct.

We will resume at that

point in one hour.
CWhereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon from
12:00 o’clock noon to 1:02 o’clock p.ra.]
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smetanas you may

proceed.
MR. SMETANA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
In resuming., I think it might be most effective
and efficient if we could go right into the heart of the
argument that the Respondent wishes to present to the Court
and that is, as I had outlined at the outset, that It is our
contention that the documents here Involved are the law of
the General Counsel under Section A(2) and I think we — I
want to consider the three areas.
And the first is, is it final opinion under 2(A)?
With respect -— and, of course, the area in dispute
is whether it is in a final opinion in the adjudication of
the case.
QUESTION:

Are you talking about both the advice

memorandum and the aDDeals memorandum?

You are lumDine: them

39
together?
MR. SMETANA:

Yes, your Honor.

I think in that

regard perhaps I ought just to say in passing that, as
Mr. Friedman accurately described, they have a different
genesis, so far as their effect.

They have an equal effect.

For example, in the situation — well, perhaps the
best example I can use is the appeals memorandum attached
to the Chamber’s brief, which I briefly referred to.

It is

the Appendix to the amicus brief.
That memorandum was prepared — it took the
General Counsel probably the best part of a year of con­
sultations, briefs from the various parties — there were
perhaps six or eight cases involving the particular question
under Section 8(E) of the act, a very complex area which
you;,- Honors have before you in ^g Connell case and, as a
matter of interest to the Court, to show the significance
that the unions in the Connell case placed upon this, that is
73-1256, Connell Construction versus Plumbers and Steamfitters
Local 100.

They attached the identical memorandum as appen­

dix to their brief to support their

position.

Now, I am not going to talk about there is merit
to that part at all but I think it is significant in the
£?Jl*iaAA case,that Connell appendix also contains the advice
of the appeals letter.
And then there is the appeals memorandum which is

40

essentially the document In the Chamber's brief in the
Bonner case.
Now the — prior to this appeals memorandum, how­
ever, these oases were submitted for advice so there was —
we have never seen that advice memorandum.

It was a very

secret document and the parties had to argue in the dark as
to what the position of the General Counsel was.
In fact, in the very Connell case, the Fifth
Circuit, which Is before you' in that case, the Fifth Circuit
was critical of the General Counsel for not acting.
Now, he has it within his prerogative and on review
of the discretion whether to proceed or not.

But the fact

remains that until this memorandum was published and this
General Counsel, in his grace, decided to make it available
to the Bar, the Bar had no way of knowing for ten years or
thereabouts why the General Counsel refused to give this
question to the board and In this instance he, of course,
gave it to the board.
■»

Notv, in an advice situation, the advice memorandum
is every bit as final, your Honor as the appeals memorandum
if the party chooses not to appeal because that is the law.
Whether or not the party chooses to appeal in the
underlying Sears case, for example, we presented oral argument.
I did myself to the office of the General Counsel and it was
because of that oral — and the first time around, it was to

Ml
no avail.

The advice memorandum was against us and we

never did see exactly what was in — we have seen it
recently because the case is no*J

closed but we never did

see the advice memorandum.
As a result, when we filed the appeal, we were
arguing in the dark.
Now, the General Counsel attempted to give us
some more information as this process went forward in this
case, again as a matter of

grace, and I think the Appendix

reflects the letter of the regional director which is
exhibit — page 21 where the regional directors after we
made the demand for the advice memorandum the first time
indicating that we were proceeding with respect to the
Freedom of Information Act, the first paragraph of that
letter states, "This letter sets forth with greater particu­
larity my reasons for refusing to issue complaint in the
above-captioned case and is sent pursuant to the teletype of
July 21, '71 from Acting General Counsel Goslee to you,"
I think that is very significant, that .letter, for
a number of reasons.
First of all, it shows that the director is, in
essence, acting in a ministerial capacity and Judge Corcoran
beloitf quite correctly made that finding based on the facts
of this case and these facts are not unique.
The record includes the operations of the General

Counsel, which is his statement to the House Committee in
1961 which continues to be so and it includes the lengthy
ABA report.
I think also this underlying case — and, again,
this is page 21 of the Appendix — points up the fact that
the General Counsel on three occasions changed his theory.
Now he is permitted to do that.

We ultimately won

because he issued a complaint in our favor but at no time did
we really know what his theory was the first time and at
no time did we really know xihat his theory finally was when
he was going to proceed.
So it was very difficult to act and it certainly
would be very difficult for the other side if they were in
disagreement with the basis of his action.
And yet if we'had chosen not to file the appeal or
a party chooses not to appeal, that is final, final not
only as to that party, but, moreover, final because the law
of the advice — that is the law of the General Counsel if
it is not appealed and it is interesting to note that while
parties are informed of an appeals decision, parties are not
informed when the matter goes to advice.
Now, I think sophisticated practitioners before the
board know to ask the right questions and if you do ask, they
will tell you, but you might not ever know when you get a
letter from a regional director that it was pursuant to an

43
advice determination unless these advice determinations are
made public.
Now, also in terms of how the procedure works
while we are on the procedure, I would call the Court’s
attention to Appendix — the Appendix attached to the
Respondent’s brief in the case here and particularly 3a,
the second paragraph on that — in that Appendix —
QUESTION:

Page ?

MR. SMETANA:

Page 3a of the Respondent’s

Appendix, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. SMETANA:

And this is from the admitted

statement as to how the office works given by the General
Counsel to the House of Congress.
It says ~ the second paragraph, ’’Secondly, the
advice branch does not ordinarily review the regional
director’s factual determinations and conclusions.

It does

not interfere with the investigatory duties of the regional
director but rather, it concerns itself with the interpre­
tations and applications of legal principles.”
And going on, your Honors, to page 4 at the top of
the following page, "There are four consultative functions
that take place," and I talk about advice but it is conceded
and the judge found and in this operations memorandum it
is conceded that the appeals functions essentially the same

44
way except it is on appeal rather than on advice and there
are four steps before this final deoision is rendered by the
General Counsel.
Step one on page 4a, "The reviewing attorney
researches all cases in point and ascertains the applicability
of prior advice determinations."
And I should add that while the General Counsel in
the Quarterly Report in which he — which is published at
page 150 of the regular Appendix — in one of the cases
specifically cites to a prior Quarterly Report — to a prior
decision in a prior Quarterly Report.
I can’t find it” at this moment, your Honor, but it
is there.
The second thing that happens in this procedure i3,
having reviewed the case it is then submitted for further
consideration to an advice agenda and then it goes on to
explain all the people that are at the agenda and this is
essentially a conference where the legal issues are batted
around.
Then it goes on to

say, "Depending upon the

complexity of the case, cases may be submitted to the
agenda orally or by written memorandum."
I should add, at the time this agenda takes place,
the oral argument of counsel will have been presented, not
face-to-face but separately.

The legal position of the

45
region will have been

presented and the submission of the

parties to the case will have been presented.
Then, the agenda decision — there is a decision
rendered.

Hie decision is submitted to the General Counsel

and then finally, at the second paragraph on 4a, the
General Counsel’s final determination is communicated to
the regional office by way of a memorandum from advice and
that is the memorandum we are talking about.
And the record reflects there is no instance, no
instance in this record where a regional director has ever
not followed that advice and the advice, obviously, is a
euphemism in the circumstances.
Now, in terms of why these are final opinions
and, Mr. Justice Stewart, the same is true of appeals in the
way it works.

We say it essentially —

QUESTION:

Would you tell me again how the record

shows that an advice memo is always followed?

government’s burden and there Is no Instance in this record
where they produced any evidence to show that It was not

the General Counsel has conceded in his brief on page 6
and it was also conceded earlier in the open court that
rarely, if ever, does a regional director disregard an
advice decision.
And I think if you will think of the nature of this
- whole process, the General Counsel indicates — requires —•

QUESTION:

a

The grey, sir, I'm sorry.

Grey.

MR. SMETANA:

Thank you.

Now, let me, if I may, come back to

the Section 2(A) and why it is a final opinion.
First of all, I think it has been conceded it is
a separate agency and an agency under the APA,. not just
under the Freedom of Information Act and interestingly, of
course, Mr. Friedman tries to suggest that perhaps there might
be some difference in the definition of adjudication of the
Freedom of Information Act but of course it is all one act.

47
The APA Is a part of the Freedom of Information Act.
And the APA defines adjudication to means
agency process in the formulation of an order.
And an order to mean, In whole or in part, any
part of the final disposition of an agency and turning to
your Honors' decision this morning with respect to the ITT
case, at page 15 of the slip opinion, your Honors state,
"When Congress defined order in terms of a final disposi­
tion, it required that final disposition to have some
determinate consequence for the party to the proceeding."
Now, there is no question that the consequence is
grave here.

Party to the proceeding either gets the

remedy that he seeks or he does not.
QUESTION:

Well, but you are reading two ways.

There was a final opinion and your are reading it two ways.
In every single instance of adjudication in the Administra­
tive

Procedure Act, I certainly don't read two ways on it.

MR. SMETANA:

Well, your Honor, I must say, first

of all, it is — our argument is that it is an agency and.
this agency has the responsibility for making vast decisions
with respect to the development of the law and this is how
it speaks, only through this fashion.
When this agency decides not to proceed, that is
the lav/ of the land.

There is nothing — no individual in

this country can bring a suit to change that law if the

48
General Counsels in his wisdom, decides not to proceed.
And decisions not to proceed are every bit as much
the law's decisions to proceed and these memoranda simply
explicate that.
QUESTION:

DOes this sound to you as if it were

addressed to this type of prosecutorial decision, final
opinions including concurring and dissenting opinions?
You don't get that kind of a thing out of a
prosecutor's office.
MR. SMETANA: Well, you do in the nature — you do
in the nature of this agency.

It may be, your Honor, in the

Justice Department it is different.
The nature of this agency, having worked at the
agency, there are — when the document comes into — from
the field, there is a majority opinion, frequently a
dissenting opinion.

There is a lot of due process and

justice within the agency.

It is just not publicized and

there are dissenting opinions.
Now, I am not sure there are dissenting opinions
in the adjudication of this but, of course, that is not
critical.
But I would say, your Honor, that we don't only
rely on 2(A).
We said that, in the alternative, even if it is
not 2(A), it is clearly — it is clearly 2(B) and 2(B) —

49
these are statements of policy specifically adopted by an
agency and the General Counsel, in his quarterly report,
page 150 of the Appendix, specifically publishes that
adopted policy and he states at the opening of that report,
"In my judgment, this publication produces a better-informed
Labor Bar."
Now, presumably, he thought publication would
help not to interfere with law enforcement.

These are open

cases.
If the concern of your Honor were there — now,
he may have been wrong in his wisdom but if you look at the
very documents in issue here, your Honor, I think you will
find that these documents do not interfere with law
enforcement.

I think that is certainly one of the critical

policy questions.
If you take, for example, a sample of an appeals
memorandum, apart from the one I had referred to. Is on

denied.

It says, action, appeal

Reasons for action, in view of the attached amend­

ment to the ITU negotiation plan, further proceedings i^ould
not effectuate the policies of the act.
So that is the end of it.
Now, one of the Issues of this case, a collateral

50
issue perhaps, is where is that attached amendment?
Now, the — Judge Corker I think quite properly
said that where it is specifically referred to, we should
see it because we were trying to decide how we could present
our case and if these matters are final, or if they are
agency opinions, we are entitled to the entire opinion.
And here this document is appended and specifically
identified and we submit, therefore, it ought to be produced,
subject to the General Counsel’s showing why it might fall
into one of the exceptions.
If it does, if, for some reason, the document is
not final, if it is in negotiations, that might be something
else.
We turn the page, your Honor, to page 83 and there
we have an advice memorandum.
Unfortunately, this record doesn’t indicate the
heading but that is an advice memorandum and if you look
through it, it says on the very first page, this was sub­
mitted for advice because it is a novel question of law
concerning a union’s withdrawal from multi-union, multi­
employer bargaining.
That was the very issue in the underlying Sears
case.
We needed to know this rationale.

This was based

on these Kinds of rationale that we were able to proceed and

51

just as a matter of housekeep5_ng, starting at page 185 to
the end —
QUESTION:

Mr. Smetana.

MR. SMETANA:
QUESTION:

Sorry.

This memorandum you are talking about

on pages 83, 84, 85 of the Appendix, a good part of it is
just the General Counsel’s interpretation of the board's
decision.
I mean, presumably Sears has its own legal
department.

They can interpret the board’s decision.

MR. SMETANA:

No, your Honor — certainly we

can, but there are no board decisions.

That is really the

problem.
The last decision of the board here was probably
ten years ago, the Retail Associates case —
QUESTION:
page 83 through 85.

Well, take a look at the thing on
I see one, two, three, four citations

to the board opinions in that memorandum.
MR. SMETANA:

Right.

But, your Honor, the point

is this is how he interprets them and he will decide to
proceed or not to proceed.
In this particular case, he decided not to pro­
ceed.

As a matter of fact, until our case came along the

General Counsel just refused to proceed on relitigating the

52
issue of what constitutes withdrawal from a multi-employer
bargaining unit and there was nothing you could do to get
him to proceed in that fashion.
QUESTION:

I have forgotten what term you used,

but you said you needed to know or you almost implied that
it was imperative to know.

Well* of course, all lawyers

know it is very interesting to know what the other fellow is
thinking on the other side, but that doesn't mean that you
have got to — this statute contemplates that you should
know his thought processes any more than people can find out
the thought processes or reasons why certiorari is denied in
this Court sometimes,
MR. SMETANA:

I think the test, your Honor, I think

the test, your Honor, is that there is no question this is the
law of this agency.

That is how he proceeds and I think the

test, as has been said by the Hawkes court, the Sixth Circuit,
is whether or not it will promote or impede law enforcement
and there is nothing in these documents that, in our view,
will impede the enforcement of the law.
In fact, the General Counsel himself believes they
promote the enforcement of the law.
Now, let me turn, very briefly, if I may, to the
exemptions and why we are not covered.

I have already said

that the exemptions are mutually exclusive because if, in
fact, these are final, substantive opinions of an agency.

53
then for the agency simply to be able to pass them between
itself intra-agency would create the very body of secret
law which is not desired and Mr. Justice Basil — Chief
Judge Basilon of the D. C. Circuit in the Sterling case
which is cited in our brief essentially drew the distinction
between formulations of policy and substantive declarations
as to whether the exemptions applied.
We submit these are clearly substantive declara­
tions of policy rather than the formulation of the policy.
The formulation is what I described in going
through the advice and appeals memoranda.
So far as B(7) is concerned, the Congress
recently amended B(7) of the act to specifically take out
what is in issue here because they indicated —- and I am
reading from the New Amendments to the Freedom of Informa­
tion Act B(7), "Investigatory records are exempt but only
to the extent such records would interfere with law
enforcement proceedings," which is, again, the same as the
Hawkes test.
And, more importantly, in the conference report
on page 12, describing that language, the Congress says,
"Nor is this exemption intended to include records falling
within the scope of subsection 52(A)(2)s which is A, B, C ,
which is the very thing that we are talking about here.
Thank you, your Honors.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is

used up, Mr. Friedman.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:19 o’clock p.m., the case
vras submitted. ]
