ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TUTTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
This case involves the application of the Freedom
of Information Act to certain documents generated within
the Renegotiation Board in the course of fulfilling its
statutory mandate to eliminate excessive profits from
national defense contracts made with the United States.
More specifically, the issue is whether reports
of renegotiation prepared by the staff of the regional
boards and recommendations prepared by divisions of the
statutory boards are intra-agency memoranda within the
Exemption 5 to the Freedom of Information Act.
The District Court held that certain reports of
renegotiation and division

recommendations were final

opinions made in the adjudication of cases within the Public
Disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
affirmed the judgment tif the District Court but added two

4
holdings of its own.
One was that the regional boards were themselves
agencies so that their reports to the statutory board were
the final opinions of the regional boards themselves
considered as agencies.
The second holding of the Court of Appeals was that
the documents sought were identifiable records within
Section 552(A)(3) of the Act and they were not exempt under
Exemption 5.
Our contention is that these documents, the reports
of renegotiation and the division recommendations are intra­
agency advisory memoranda within Exemption 5.
In order to determine whether these documents are
such interagency memoranda, it is helpful to take a look at
the renegotiation process and the role played by the documents
sought within that process.
The charter of the Renegotiation Board is to
eliminate excessive profits in contracts made with the United
States relating to the national defense.
There is no fixed formula for what constitutes an
excessive profit.
In fact. Congress rejected the express profit
limitations provisions of predecessor statutes and in their
place adopted a number of statutory criteria which The
Renegotiation B oard is required to consider.

5
In consequence, what constitutes an excessive
profit is necessarily a matter calling for the exercise of
judgment.

This judgment is committed in the first instance

to The Renegotiation Board but subject to de novo review
by the Court of Claims.
Under these general statutory criteria established
by Congress, The Renegotiation Board, as its name suggests,
negotiates.
As this Court said last term in the Bannercraft
case, the character and entire atmosphere is negotiation.
It is pure bargaining, the kind of bargaining that
produces the union employer agreement for the transfer of
substantial property from a willing seller to an interested
buyer.
The renegotiation process begins when a case Is
assigned by the Statutory Board to one of the two subordinate
Regional Boards.
Cases are divided into Class A and Class B cases.
Class A cases are cases where the renegotiable profits
exceed $800,000.
All of the documents which we are concerned with
here were generated in Class A cases.
In Class A cases, the Regional Board possesses the
power only to make recommendations to the Statutory Board
concerning the amount, if any, of excessive profits.

6
After a case is assigned to the Regional Board, a
team consisting of an accountant and a renegotiator meets
with the contractor,

secures the necessary information and

prepares a report and recommendation to the

Statutory Board.

At the time these documents were generated, that
report was called a report of renegotiation and consisted of
a part 1(A) prepared by the accountant and a part 2 prepared
by the renegotiator.
The part 2 was an evaluation of the contractor
under the statutory factors established by Congress, thus a
typical part 2 would consider the character of the contractor's
business, the capital he employed, the extent of risk he
assumed, his contribution to the defense effort, his efficiency
and the reasonableness of his costs and profits.
The part 2 would end with the renegotiator's
recommendation in the case.
Thus the report of renegotiation might recommend a
finding of excessive profits or it might recommend a
clearance, that is, a finding of no excessive profits.
Or, finally, if the contractor had agreed to a
determination of excessive profits, it might recommend that
the Renegotiation Board enter into an agreement with the
contractor as to the amount of excessive profits.
If there is an excess profit recommendation, and
if the contractor requests it, he is given an onnorturrli-.v

t-.n

7
meet with a panel of the Regional Board and present his
reasons as to why his profit is not excessive.
The panel then would prepare a report and report
to the Regional Board.

If there is still a recommendation

of a finding of excessive profits9 the contractor can re­
quest a summary of facts and reasons which states the basis
of the Regional Board's recommendation.
If no agreement can be reached at that point, the
case is forwarded to the Statutory Board.
In the Statutory Board, the case is reviewed by
the Office of Accounting and the Office of Review.

Typically,

in the Office of Review, the reviwer prepares a memorandum
expressing his views on the case and the director of the
Office of Review would make his comments.
I want to —
QUESTION:

You are saying,then, that the Statu­

tory Board doesn't necessarily go along with the Regional
Board.
MR. TUTTLE:

Oh, that is quite clear.

There is

no -- I will be developing in a moment what happens in the
Regional Board.

As far as I have gotten in my description

of the procedures, Mr. Justice, I am explaining what the
Regional Board does and the most that they can do is forward
a recommendation to the Statutory Board.
In the Statutory Board, the Statutory Board has

8
its own staff,

the Office of Reviex* and the Office of

AccountingAs I suggested, these offices prepare memoranda
which I wanted to call to the Court’s attention because they
show that the report of renegotiation, advisory though it is,
is not the last recommendation that the board, the Statutory
Board receives before it makes its decision.
Now, if there is a recommendation for a finding of
excessive profits to the Statutory Board, it is commonly
assigned to a division of the Statutory Board consisting of
three of its five members.
I’ll discuss the division in a moment.
If there Is a recommendation for a clearance, that
is to say, a finding of no excessive profits, the board may
consider the case without referring it to a division.
'

Now, it is important for the purposes of this case

to realise that when the Statutory Board considers the case,
it will not limit itself to the discussions or reasoning
contained in the Report of Renegotiation or, for that matter,
any documents generated by the Office of Review.
The chairman of the Renegotiation Board was deposed
in this case and, on this subject, at page 79 of the Appendix
he said, "When the recommendation for a clearance of the
Regional Board comes up on the board agenda, it simply
approves or disapproves the clearanne.

T+-. rfnoo

9
any of the memoranda that are before it."
QUESTION:

Was there any conflicting testimony

or deposition —
MR. TUTTLE:

This is uncontradicted testimony and

it — as I will point out in a moment, it is incorporated in
the District Court’s findings.
QUESTION:

How did the

District Court rule in

the case?
MR. TUTTLE:

As an ultimate holding?

The ultimate

holding of the District Court was that these were final
opinions of the Renegotiation Board.
QUESTION:

I meant as to the subjects covered by

Mr. Hartwig’s testimony.
MR. TUTTLE:

The District Court, at page 210 of

the Appendix, says, "It is important to note that in no
case does the board formally adopt the reports or
recommendations either of the Regional Board or of its
staff.

It considers and studies but it does not adopt,"

and then the District Court quotes from the deposition to
support this findings.
This is essentially uncontradicted.
Now, if there is a recommendation of excessive
profit findings, the case will be referred to a

division

and the division will meet with the contractor to prepare
their reports and recommendations.

10

Again, when the Statutory Board considers the case,
it won’t limit itself to matters discussed in the divisional
report.

This is at page 8l of the Appendix.
When the board adopts the recommendation of the

division, It does just that.

It adopts the conclusion or

recommendation but it does not adopt the report and then the
District Court made the finding that I quoted to Mr. Justice
Rehnquist just a moment ago.
If there is a determination of excessive profits,
the board will then determine the amount of the profits and,
again, if the contractor requests it, he can receive a
summary "of facts and reasons stating the basis for the board’s
conclusions.
If agreement can still not be reached — and,
mind you, negotiation is going on ail along in the nature of
this process, the board will issue a unilateral order
determining the amount of the profits.
Now, this is the Statutory Board and only the
Statutory Board which could issue such an order.
At the time the order was entered, if the contractor
requested it, he could obtain a statement of facts and
reasons for the excess profit determination — if he requested
it.
Except for the statement of facts and reasons, at
the time this case arose. t-.Vie Ronon-nti^

issue opinions to accompany its orders.

Thus in the case

of a clearance, that is, a finding of no excessive profits,
or an agreement with a contractor, the board would simply
enter an order.
Members of the board might differ as to the
particular weight to be given to any factor or circumstance.
All that was required for board action was agreement as to
the results, not necessarily as to the reasoning.
As the then-chairman of the Renegotiation Board,
Mr. Hartwig, testified — and this is at page 100 of the
Appendix — ’"Many times a board member will agree to a
clearance for none of the reasons stated in the staff
document.

He may have his own reasons.

His assistants

may have checked out some point that was bothering him that
*

he didn't even bother to discuss with his colleagues.

But

the important thing is the informality of our procedure
whereby

we all agree that we agree on the results."
Now, in spite of the unoontradicted evidence that

the board did not adopt any of the recommendations before it
and did not issue opinions

in clearance cases and agreement

cases, the District Court and the Court of Appeals held
that these documents were final --

that the reports of

renegotiation and the division reports were final opinions
made in the adjudication of cases.
This was because, in the words of the District

12

Court, they were the last documents which explained the
board’s decision.
The premise of these decisions appears to be that
boards ought to be writing final opinions and when they don’t
it is appropriate to treat the most proximate staff document
containing the advice followed

by the agency as the agency's

final opinion.
Now, obviously, agencies under the threat of such
treatment will be forced to write opinions to accompany their
orders as the Renegotiation Board now does but we think it
distorts the function of the Freedom of Information Act to
use it to force agencies to write opinions where they didn’t
ordinarily,
QUESTION:

Congress really dealt with that in the

Administrative Procedure Act, didn’t they, as to -MR. TUTTLE:

And I -- Mr. Justice, I should say, in

light of your mention of that, that the Renegotiation Board
is explicitly exempted from the Administrative Procedure Act,
except for the Public Information sections of it.
Congress made a — recognizing the negotiative
character of what they do, they said this is not APA-type
adjudication.
We think that that act was not designed to judicialize the operations of agencies which had operated informally
b<= fnr»A

•hhn’h

13
Moreover, we think that to force agencies to
write opinions to accompany every order on pain of having
their staff memoranda treated as if they were the agency’s
final opinion could seriously impair the efficiency of
agency decision-making.
As the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia said in the Sterling Drug case, "It is completely
unreasonable to suppose that every agency order can be
accompanied by an opinion."
Parenthetically, that Court observed that three
to four — some agencies issued three to four million
orders a year.
There is another reason xfhy we think it is
illogical to treat "The last document which explains the
board’s decision" as the agency's final opinion.

Whereas,

with the Renegotiation Board, the agency receives recommen­
dations from a number of tiers of the hierarchy, there is
no reason at all to suppose that it follows the reasoning
of the recommendation which is most recent in time.
In my own agency, within the Justice Department,
if there is a recommendation to the Solicitor General not
to petition this Court for certiorari, there may be in the
file a recommendation from the Civil Division recommending
no cert, a recommendation from an affected agency,

a

recommendation from an assistant to the Solicitor General,

14
a recommendation from the Deputy Solicitor General.
And there is no reason at all to suppose that the
Solicitor General, in making his judgment as to whether or
not to authorize certiorari if he decides not to petition,
would base his decision on the expressions of opinion in the
most recent staff document.
He might be listening to the Civil Division or he
might have reasons of his own,
Our submission is that the part 2 of the Report
of Renegotiation and the division recommendations are intra­
agency memoranda within Exemption 5 of the Freedom of
Information Act.
QUESTION;

Whether or not they are final opinions.

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Well, I think —
You have to prove both, don’t you?

MR. TUTTLE:

MR. TUTTLE:

That is the point, your Honor.
Yes.
The only reason why

we talk about

Exemption 5 is that it doesn’t — we don't win the case by
proving that they are not final opinions.
QUESTION:

That Is rieht.

You have to — because

15
they are 1dentifiahle re c ord3.
MR. TUTTLE:

Clearly so.

So we —

You have to prove that they are not

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
because it

We have to prove both of those things.
Yes.
That is why we stress Exemption 5

wouldn’t do us any good to prove to you that they

were not final opinions.
Now, Exemption 5 provides that the Public Dis­
closure Provisions of the Act do not apply "To matters that
are interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters
which would not be available by law to a party other than
an agency in litigation with the agency."
As this Court said in the Mink case, that
exemption was intended to incorporate generally the
recognized rule that confidential intra-agency advisory
opinions are privileged from inspection.
It seems to us that reports of renegotiation are
such Intra-agency memoranda within this traditional privilege.
The Regional Board where these memoranda are
generated possesses no powers of decision in Class A cases.
They can only recommend to the Statutory Board.
Statutory Board can decide.

And in deciding. It gets

advice from the Office of Review.

It gets

But the evidence is that

it does not adopt any of the reasoning of any of the advice.
'

The traditional privilege is recognised in order

to promote the frank and open exchange of views

and opinions

between superiors and subordinates within an agency and it
seems to us that that freedom of communication will be
jeopardized by a holding which would treat advisory memoranda
as the agency's opinion whenever the agency happens to

follow

the advice.
Moreover, those documents, since they don't contain
the actual reasons for the agency's action, would mislead the
public as to the basis of decision.
As the Court of Appeals said in the Sterling Drug
case, speaking of an agency decision, "The ultimate decision
was something more than or at least different from the sum
of its parts.

Consequently, we doubt the proof of the parts

would give an accurate picture of the decision."
We think the same considerations apply to the
division recommendations.

Again, the uncontradioted testimony

is that these documents are not adopted by the agency when it
reaches a result.
These documents, too, ought to be protected in order
to allow a full and frank exchange of views between the
ultimate decision-makers.

17
As the Court in the Sterling Drug case commented,
"Congress expressly indicated that intra-agency communications
of thought and opinion are to be protecfced"and nowhere is
that protection more needed than between the ultimate
decision-makers of the agencies.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Court of Appeals'

decision in Sterling Drug and its opinion in this case are
entirely consistent with one another?
MR. TUTTLE:

No, I don't think they are consistent

and, quite frankly, that Is why I am quoting from the
Sterling Drug case and not from the decision below.
The —■ we don't believe that the division
recommendations are concurring opinions, either, of the
members who make them.

They are preliminary expressions of

view which are subject to change and conclusive proof of this
to my mind is the fact that there are Instances where the
board will enter a unilateral order which order will differ
from the recommendation made by the division and yet the
board member whose views were expressed in the division
memorandum will not dissent from the board's ultimate order.
Finally, we don't believe that these reports of
renegotiation are final opinions of the Regional Board.
This Is because Regional Boards are not agencies
within the meaning of the Adminiatrative Procedure Act.
Section 551(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act

18

defines an agency as any authority of the United States
including an authority within an agency,
This definition is hardly self-defining.
We think the Senate Report written to a company,
the legislation.- is more helpful.

That explains that an

authority is an agency, even an authority within another
agency, when it has the power to take final and binding
action.
Now, the Regional Boards clearly have no such power
to take final and binding action in Class A cases.

Therefore,

they are not agencies.
We think this is confirmed by the 1974 Amendments
to the Freedom of Information Act which Mr. Justice Brennan
spoke of this morning.

That act imposes a host of new duties

and obligations on administrative agencies.
It requires, for instance, the publication of
quarterly indices of opinions.

It requires annual reports to

Congress.
We think it is clear that Congress did not intend
that subordinates within an agency should make these reports
to Congress or publish these indices.

Thus, the conferees on

the bill, when they were explaining the term "agency" which
had been amended in the act and @^panded to include the
Postal Service essentially, stated, "Expansion of the
p3fM VI ‘1

...

IS
of the freedom of Information Act but it is not intended
that the term ’agency* be applied to subdivisions, offices
or units within an agency."
This language, we think, is simply confirmatory
of what we believe to be the

correct view of Section 551(1)

that the Regional Boards are not agencies because they don’t
possess the power of decision and that the reports of
renegotiation, which are the Regional Boards’ recommenda­
tions to the Statutory Board, are not the final opinions
of an agency entered in the adjudication of the case.
For these reasons —
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle5 do you rely —

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
That is, so far as the exemptions go,

the statutory exemptions, are you relying only on number 5?
MR. TUTTLE:

We are relying solely

on Exemption 5,

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, I am just curious.

What

is the government's interpretation of — and I am looking
at Exemption 5 — "Other than an agency in litigation with
the agency"?

What is the "Other than an agency"?

What does

that have reference to?
MR. TUTTLE:

I confess, Mr. Justice, I was not

able to determine what that particular language was added
for.

It is clear that the exemption was generally designed

20
to incorporate the traditional privilege and in some of the
drafts3 earlier drafts, that language did not occur.
I regret I don't Know the answer to that.
QUESTION:

I think we have had litigation before

us here between, say. Commerce, the Census Department and
PTC.

I recall a case like that.

Would it be something like

that?
MR. TUTTLE:

I wouldn’t — I would only be specu­

lating, I'm sorry, I —
QUESTION:

You don't know if there is any legisla­

tive history behind that?

It must mean something but it is

rather odd language, isn’t it?
MR. TUTTLE:

It is odd language and I am sorry I

don’t know the answer to your question.
QUESTION:

Would not intra-government conflict be

certainly one of the classic cases that would fit 5?

Two

different agencies of government taking different positions,
as Justice has sometimes disagreed with the Power Commission
or what-not?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR, TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, I —

I can't think of any others.
No, I — I — I just don’t —
Well, at least the section refers to

documents that would be available to a party — that would
not be available to a nartv litieatiner with an acenev.

21
MR. TUTTLE:

That is correct, sir.

That is the

essence of the —
QUESTION:

And just forget the other-than-the»

agency.
MR. TUTTLE:

That — well, certainly, that is not

involved in this case and the essence of it is whether a
party would be able to receive it under traditional discovery
principles and, of course, as this Court has recognized in
the Mink case, those — this privilege has been recognized
before the passage of the Freedom of Information Act and
that Is the operative provision of Section 5.
If there are no further questions, I’d like to
reserve the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Sehaumberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOM M. SCHAUMBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Please the Court:
In 1967, in response to the promulgation of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Renegotiation Board itself
enacted new regulations which provided that the board would
henceforth make its opinions available to the public.
Despite those new regulations Issued by the board,
the board did not issue any opinions to the public.

It was

22

not until 1970, as a result of the

first decision by the

Court of Appeals in this case., that the board was forced to
recognize that so-called '’statements of facts and reasons
are, in fact, final opinions."
The Court of Appeals so held and the Renegotiation
Board d5.d not seek any further review of that determination.
Similarly, in 1971, as a result of the District
Court’s opinion on remand, the board was also forced to
admit that its summaries of facts and reasons are opinions
which must be made available under the Freedom of Information
Act and under the regulations promulgated by the board.
When the case was back in the District Court,
therefore, the question was one of definition of what
constitutes final opinion within the procedures of the
Renegotiation Board.
Having just heard the argument, it would appear
that the board has never issued an opinion and has never
recognized that it has issued an opinion but, in fact, it
has and it has recognized so by making the.se earlier documents
available to the public.
Therefore, the Issue that is now before this Court,
as it was in the District Court, is one of definition:

What

constitutes a final opinion?
And we submit that under the two-court affirmance
doctrine with the District Court having clearly found that

23
these documents are final opinions of the board because
they have all of the Indicia of final opinions, with the
Court of

Appeals having affirmed that decision as not

being clearly erroneous, it is clear that these documents
constitute final opinions and the arguments that have just
been made are factual arguments, trying to show that
because of the procedures of the board, these documents are
not final opinions.
Now, turning for a moment to the findings of the
District Court that Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked about:
At the point in the District Court opinion where
the Court said that the board does not adopt the division
reports and the Regional Board reports, what the District
Court was saying — and I’d like to refer the Court —
QUESTION:

Can you give us a page there?

MR. SCHAUMBER:

Yes, in the petition, that is at

page 28a.
QUESTION:

The Appendix to the petition.

MR. SCHAUMBER:

Yes, sir.

In the first paragraph

of page 28a, the last sentence, the District Court said that
the gist of Mr. Hartwig’s testimony concerning renegotiation
procedures follows and there then followed three or four
pages of the nature of the testimony of Mr. Hartwig.
Turning then to page 37a of the same

Appendix,

the last paragraph, that is the finding of the District

2l\

Court.

It says, "It is unrealistic to claim that because

board members might have different reasons for approval of
the division’s recommendation, the report of the division upon
which its recommendation is based is not a final opinion.
QUESTION:
a

Can you really say that that Is strictly

question of fact?
MR, SCHAUMBERG:

I think you have to go back to

the previous paragraph on page 37a.
It says, "It appears to the Court that in this
type of case, the division report, rather than the unilateral
order, is the crucial and final document,"
The report contains a consideration of the statutory
factors, explains the reasons for the division's recommen­
dations and gives the facts on which the reasoning rests.
X think that is a finding of fact and I think the
way the District Court reached that finding of fact is by
referring to the statement of facts and reasons.
I’d refer the Court to the joint Appendix, page 35.
QUESTION:

In that paragraph, this is the essence

of a final opinion, has the ring of a finding of law, doesn't
it?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
either way.

I think the Court arrived at it —*

QUESTION:

Well, if it is not --

MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

Does the two-court rule apply except

where3 clearly, there is agreement between the two courts
on what concededly are fact findings?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

I think that would be correct,

that it is only when it is concededly a finding of fact.
The Court of Appeals treated these findings as
findings of fact and I i^ould now like to turn to the state­
ment of facts and reasons which appears at page 35 of the
Joint Appendix.
QUESTION:

Before you leave that, when you say

the Court of Appeals treated them as findings of fact, here
we have something like 10 or 11 pages — more than that —a
dozen pages.

Some of them are fact-finding.

Some of them

are mixed and some of them would strike me, at least, as
being pure statement of the legal conclusions so a general­
ization by the Court of Appeals doesn't really fit every line
and every sentence in that opinion, does it?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

Well, in that case I would refer

26
the Chief Justice to the brief of the board to the Court of
Appeals.
Before the Court of

Appeals, the Board argued

that the principle issue before that court is what constitutes
a final opinion?
There was no Exemption 5

question.

There were no

It was strictly a question of whether the

documents in issue constitute final opinions and in response
to that argument, which was also the argument that we held
before the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals said that
it could not find the findings below clearly erroneous and
therefore, affirmed that opinion and then went on into the
alternative holdings.
QUESTION:

iphe clearly erroneous will apply to all

the findings, true findings of fact but for nothing else.
MR, SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

Of the District Court.

ment simply to prove that they are not final opinions doesn't
enable it to prevail in this lawsuit.

got to also bring them under an exemption.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

Quite correct.

So, surely, the

government, unless it

was rather poorly represented in the Court of Appeals, wouldn’t
have been arguing; only that these are not final opinions.

27
I am not saying the government is never poorly
represented.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
that,

I would not like to comment on

except I would refer you to the record below.
The other side of the coin, however, is that we

can prevail by simply prevailing on the question of whether
these documents constitute final opinions.
QUESTION:

In an adjudication.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:

In an adjudication.

There is no

issue in this case, unlike the previous case, that the
board adjudicates cases which are before it for the
determination of excess of profits.
QUESTION:

No, but you are saying that these

documents you want are all — all parts of these documents
you want are parts of an adjudication.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And if it is true that no member of

the board may have relied on any of the reasons given in
these documents to decide the case, how could you say that
these documents, or any one of them, is a part of an
adjudication?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

Well, the assumption is simply

not correct, according to this
QUESTION:
were true.

record.

Well, assume it were true.

Assume it

28
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

Well, if these were all staff

documents, such as those that come out of the Office of
Accounting or the Office of Review —
QUESTION:

Well, is there any contrary evidence

that some members might vote the way they did for some
reason not contained in any of the documents?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION.:

Theoretically, that is possible.

Well, It might be the critical vote in a

case.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

In the case that was examined

during the course of the deposition, and I think Mr. Tuttle
misspoke somewhat, the division consisting of three of the
five board members wrote two memoranda, one representing the
views of two members of the division and one representing the
views of the dissenting members of the division.
It then.went before the full board in a meeting
and the decision came out four to one so In that case, it is
just as easy to assume that the dissenting member of the
division continued to be the dissenting member of the full
board.
He is, in both instances, a Presidentiallyappointed member of the Renegotiation Board.
QUESTION:

Well, the reasons given in the staff

documents are only part of the adjudication if you assume
that those are the reasons unon which the adjudication by

29

the board is based.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
Mr. Justice.

But these are not staff documents,

These are documents prepared by board members

themselves.
QUESTION:

All right, but they are documents

presented to the full board.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

By some of them.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

By the board members themselves.

That is correct.

By just a division of them, or —

MR. SCHAUMBERG:

Three out of the five.

QUESTION:

So there is no — you do have to

Yes.

assume that those are the reasons on which the adjudication
is based before you can say these documents are part of an
adjudication.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Well, wouldn’t it at least be

if it

is written by a board member, a statutory board member, it
would be at least a concurring

opinion, as the District

Court pointed out.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

We would so argue and in the case

we just cited, it would either be a concurring or a —
QUESTION:

A dissenting.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:

— a dissenting opinion, yes.

But even if the full board —

30
QUESTION:

Unless he was talked out of it in

conference.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
yes.

Unless he was talked out of it,

Now, the Minutes of the Board, which were discussed

during the course of the deposition merely said the board
accepted the recommendation of the division.
There is no indication whatsoever in the Minutes of
the board that there was an extensive discussion, an
exhaustive analysis of the reasons why each board member
voted the way he did.
They simply have a Minute which reflects the fact
that either — depending on what kind of a case it was,
whether it came from the Regional Board or xvhether it came
from a division, the board accepted the recommendation.
QUESTION:

It never accepts the report.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:

That is not in the Minutes,

is the --

That

"
QUESTION:

No, but they don’t accept the reports.

MR, SCHAUMBERG:

Expressly, they do not and I would

suggest that American Mail Line is perhaps the extreme case
where a body said, we are making this decision for reasons
which we are not going to tell anybody, but they are contained
in a secret report.
That is a unique instance.

I think it is not

asking too much to consider this adoption as well because

31
even though the board does not go Into an extensive
analysis or — the fact that it does not, it can be pre­
sumed that the reasons that they did decide the case the
way they did is for the reasons that were set before them,
particularly in the case of the division report.
On the question of whether one starts with an
analysis of the exemptions in the act or the pro-disclosure
requirements, there can be no question today that the
Congress was very eager that the Freedom of Information
Act be a pro-disclosure document.
There had been many years of experience with the
previous Section 3 of the APA and Congress as well as the
public was very dissatisfied with the results and as a
consequence, the Freedom of Information Act was enacted.
In fact, Congress has spoken twice, having
recently amended the act and I think we can all assume that
Congress emphasized the importance of this act to the
public so in making the analysis of a Freedom of Information
Act request, one must begin with the pro-disclosure require­
ments of the act and we suggest that in this case, if this
Court holds that the documents do constitute final opinion,
the Court need go no further.
The Court of Appeals held — and the government
has also argued —- that final opinions and intra-agency
memoranda are mutually exclusive so, unlike the board, we

32
only need to win on that one point9 namely 5 that these
documents do constitute final opinions *
QUESTION:

But doesn't that very position somewhat

circumscribe the definition that you can give to final
opinions since, if they

are mutually exclusive with staff

documents, presumably you have got to be pretty sure that It
was something that was adopted either expressly or by impli­
cation by the decision-making authority.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

I think that is correct and I think

the District Court so found and I think it stated its reasons
for finding that these documents are the final opinions.
■

t

We must remember that there is no document that —
ti. t-:

at least at the time this case wa3 brought, which emanates
from the board and is called a ’’final opinion."
If we were arguing before this Court right now as
to whether or not statements of facts and reasons are final
opinions, many of the same arguments could be made.

They are,

those documents are actually generated by the staff, whereas
the documents we are talking about now, for instance, the
division report^ are actually written by Division Board
members.
So it is a question of definition.

The board has

conceded, during the six years of this litigation, that
statements of facts and reasons are opinions, summaries of
facts and reasons are opinions.

33
And now the only two

questions left are whether

division reports are opi-nions and whether reports of the
Regional Board are opinions.
QUESTION:

But there is no statutory requirement,

of course, that the board issue any final opinions at all.
It is exempt from the other sections of the Administrative
Procedure Act.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

There is a provision in the

Renegotiation Act which does state that the board will
provide a statement of facts and reasons to the contractor
if

he requests it.
QUESTION:

Yes, in his case.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And that is not what you are claiming

here, is —
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

No.

— that you want a statement of facts

in your case, is it?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
QUESTION:

No, we do not.

You don’t claim under that.

MR. SCHAUMBERG:

No.

But we are claiming that —■

we are claiming under the board’s regulations, the board
promulgated the regulations which sa.y that it will make the
final opinions available to the public.
Congress didn't say that.

The board did.

These

34
are their regulations that we are claiming under.
Turning for a manent to the Regional Boards, the
Court of Appeals went into an analysis of whether or not
the Regional Boards themselves are agencies and its analysis
commences with a consideration of Soucie versus David; which
was also a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia.
In the recent enactment of the Amendments to the
Freedom of Information Act, the Congress specifically
accepted the reasoning of Soucie versus David In determining
that the Office of Science and Technology is an agency for
purposes of the Freedom of Information Act.
We merely say this to suggest that the reasoning
of the Court of Appeals which begins with an analysis of
Soucie

deserves great weight in this Court but the Court

need not even reach this question.
If, as the District Court did, this Court finds
that the

Regional Board reports constitute the opinions of

the Statutory Board, as did the District Court, there is no
need to get into the question of whether the Regional Boards
are agencies.
It is only If the Court does not adopt that
determination of the District Court that we get into the
question of whether the Regional Boards are themselves
agencies and whether their documents should be disclosed to

35
the public.
Turning now to a consideration of Exemption 5,
as Counsel for the Board

has pointed out, if this Court

determines that the documents are not final opinions, that
they

are concededly identifiable records, in which case

they would still be available to the public unless they fit
within Exemption 5An ana3.ysis of Exemption 5 commences, I believe,
with Kaiser Aluminum versus the United States.

In Kaiser,

the court there, and that was the Court of Claims, Justice
Reid sitting by designation, spoke about the "consultative
functions of government" and suggested that intra-agency
memoranda which contained such information should not be
made available to the public.
What is very important to note, though, is that
in the Kaiser Aluminum case, the document in question was
prepared by a confidential assistant to the liquidator of
war assets.
Unlike this case where we are talking about
documents, at least in the case of division reports which
are generated not by the staff but by the decision-makers
themselves, namely, the members of the board or the documents
generated by the members of the Regional Board.
Turning next to Environmental Protection Agency
versus Mink, it, too, considered the one type of document

36
which constitutes the consultative, deliberative, advisory
functions of government which are contained in intra-agency
memoranda but it also spoke about factual information
'contained in identifiable records.
Now, this Court, in Mink, suggested that the
District Court give the agency an opportunity through oral
testimony to show that the documents should not be disclosed.
Well, the oral testimony in this case served only
to convince the District Court that the documents should be
disclosed.
Now, we suggest that the reason they should be
disclosed — and this is now with regard to Exemption 5 — is
because they are principally factual in nature and we refer
the Court in that regard to page 35 and the following
several pages of the Joint Appendix where we have shown, the
statement of facts and reasons which was

issued to Grumman

during the course of its; renegotiation process.
The argument we have made in our brief is that the
documents in issue before this case seemed to look exactly
like the document reproduced at

pages 35 and following.

Of course, we have to say "seem" because we have
never seen the documents but during the course of Chairman
Harfcwig’s deposition, we asked, in each instance, ,!Would you
please describe this document?

Would you please describe

this document?” and as he did so, he would go through the

37
statutory factors, which begin at page 37, and, indeed, the
words "character of the business, extent of the risk
assumed, capital employed, contribution to the defense
effort, efficiency," these are all the same headings which
are both in the statement of facts and reasons as well as
in the documents which are now in issue and we point this
out, not in connection with the argument that these, there­
fore, constitute final opinions of the board, but to show
that they are factual documents.
I think it is very important to note that the
government has never taken issue with our contention that
these documents contain factual Information.
We have made that argument in our principal brief
and neither in its brief or in the reply brief has the
government ever tried to suggest that these documents are
not factual in nature.

They may, indeed, have some advisory

information in them but I think Mink made it very clear that
to the extent that such information is segregable from the
factual information, the document must be made available
to the public.
In conclusion, I would simply like to mention
that there is no conflict whatever between the decisions
below and this Court’s decision in Bannercraft.
Grumman is not presently involved before the
^negotiation Board and we are here as a member of the public.

38
What is important is that the Renegotiation Board,
in determining whether a contractor has or has not realised
excessive profits, compares the contractor with other
contractors who are producing the same product or are
involved in the same processes as that contractor.
Well, in order for a contractor to bargain
effectively and make his presentation to the board meaningful,
he must have some idea of what he is being compared to and
the only way he will get that information, because it is not
available anywhere else, is from the board’s opinions or,
if we call them identifiable records, it is the factual
information that the board sets forth in these documents
and only by having access to these documents will this
bargaining process be meaningful.
QUESTION:

And if the board simply decides to not

produce any more documents, you would be in the same position
in your bargaining and yet you would have no claim under the
Freedom of Information Act.
I mean, if it is just because the board has
reduced a number of things to xtfriting that are identifiable
documents that you have your claim.
MR. SGHAUMBERG:

That is correct and because the

Congress has seen fit to enact the Freedom of Information
Act.
QUESTION:

If they wanted to do It all on the

telephone, you are out of luck.
MR. SCHAUMBERG:

That Is correct.

But Congress,

in enacting the Renegotiation Act, hoped to achieve a
system where contractors would finally agree with the board
and the more information the contractor has going into the
negotiation with the board, the more satisfied he will be
at the end of that negotiation that he has had a fair shot
before the board and will not go to the Court of Claims.
QUESTION:

Why did Congress exempt the Renegotia­

tion Board from the Administrative Procedure Act, then;, if
they felt the way you say they do?
MR. SCHAUMBERG:
inconsistent.

I don't think the two are

They exempted the board from the Administra­

tive Procedure Act because they gave the contractor a de
novo opportunity, either in the Tax Court or now in the
Court of Claims.
But that is not to say that Congress would not
like to have had the process before the board, although not
an APA-type hearing, to have been meaningful from the
contractor’s point of view so he would not seek the de novo
determination.
In other words, the more information the contractor
has, this will n&fc change his bargaining poitfer.

He has no

power before the board but if he has more information
available to him, he will be able to present a more

40

meaningful ease to the board and, hopefully,this will cause
the board to make a more reasonable determination of whether
or not he has had excessive profits.
Well, in summary, we would like to suggest that
the board itself promulgated the regulations which require
it to publish its final opinion and we respectfully suggest
that the Court of Appeals' opinion which affirmed the
District Court properly held that the documents in issue
are final opinions and even if they are not, they are
identifiable records which are not exempt under Exemption 5.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Mr. Tuttle?

Do you have anything

You have about six minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.
MR. TUTTLE:

Just a few more points, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd like to address myself first to the observation
that the reports of renegotiation are factual.

I think it

is true that they contain and they are based upon factual
information but I think, even by the example of the statement
of facts and reasons — which is idiat we have in the record
here — it is obvious that what is involved is an assessment
and a selection and an organization of facts to recommend a
certain conclusion.
These are based upon filings by the contractors.

41
The filings themselves would contain the factual
information upon which the recommendations are made and those
filings would be factual information, not within Exemption 5*
Exemption 5 applies only to the evaluative material,
even if it involves evaluation of facts and I think that it is
clear that what we have here is an evaluation and an organ­
isation of facts for the purpose of recommending a conclusion.
I wanted to say that the District Court’s opinion
on the subject of whether these documents were final opinions,
it seems to me that that conclusion is very much a conclusion
of law and quoting slightly further along in the opinion from
the point at which Mr. Sehaumberg did, on page 37a of the
Appendix, where the Court speaks of divisional reports and
recommendations as final opinions, the Court says, ”It is
unrealistic to claim, because board members might have
different reasons for the approval of a division recommendation,
that the division report is not a final opinion."
The Court recognizes, in its own legal Inferences
from the facts in the record that board members may and do
have reasons other than the reasons stated in the recommenda­
tion which comes to us.
QUESTION:

I think it is

How about the argument that the reports

at least represent the views of at least one member?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, I think in the first place, it is

somewhat anomalous to refer to them as concurring opinions in

circumstances where there is no majority opinion, certainly
not in my mind, what the common understanding of the concept
of a concurring opinion is.
I gave an example which -~
QUESTION:

Well, people concur in per curiam

opinions.
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR, TUTTLE:

Yes, it —
Or a per curiam order, summary orders.
It could be If it were the expression

of the decision-maker made after the decision had been made.
What makes these documents different is that they are
recommendations prepared prior to the time the decision­
makers make the decisions and those are subject to change.
I gave an example of the possibility of a change
where there would be a final order xvhich would differ from
the division recommendation.
I \tfas not referring to the particular case that
Mr. Schaumberg called attention to in the deposition and I
didn't mean to suggest to the Court that I was but these
views are subject to change and I think that is what makes
them something other than concurring opinions.
QUESTION:

Just to make it quite clear, you do

agree, I take it, that if these are opinions, you must
disclose them.
MR. TUTTLE:

We agree that if they are opinions —

43
QUESTION:

And that these three items in A(2) are

exclusive — and that the exemptions are mutually exclusive,
MR. TUTTLE:

Well* I would say mutually exclusive

vis-a-vis the Fifth Exemption.

It is conceivable to me that

there might be a trade secret problem or something like that;,
where there would be something that would constitute an
opinion and still be exempt but insofar as this case is
concerned for the purpose of your analysis, I do concede, yes,
that they are mutually exclusive.
The only reason that I haven’t focused on that is,
as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has said, is that it wouldn’t win
the case for me to convince you of that.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:13 o’clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
