PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1723, Hill against Stone.
Mr. Kendall, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready after this confusion disappears here.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. KENDALL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. KENDALL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
This is a suit which was brought by the Appellees
as a class action to challenge the provisions of the
Constitution of Texas, the statutes of the State of Texas
and ordinances of the City of Fort Worth which require
essentially that to vote in an election to authorize the
issuance of general obligation bonds, the voter must have
rendered either personal or real property or both for
taxation.
This, of course, is the legal obligation of all
Texas citizens.
The three-judge District Court sitting in the
Northern District of Texas found that various sections of
our Constitution, of our statutes and of the ordinances or
charter of the City of Fort Worth were unconstitutional.
It said, "They are hereby declared unconstitutional
insofar as they condition thr right to vote in bond elections

4
on citizens rendering property for taxation."
Injunctive relief was granted and the Appellants
were ordered to give effect to certain votes in an election the election which was in question here.
I would like to state our argument very briefly,
if I may, and then elaborate on it as time permits.
I think the first point we would make is that the
attack on our Constitution is based on the 14th Amendment
Equal Protection Clause.

A condition to the invoking of that

clause is that there be some classification.
It is our position, and I think we can show that
there is no classification involved here, that all residents
of the State of Texas are qualified to vote in these
elections.
The second point I would make is that if there is
a classification, nevertheless, we are not talking here about
whether or not the citizens of Tarrant County or Port Worth
may vote on a question, for instance, of whether or not they
can build a library.
The vote in question was on whether or not

Six

Million, Eight Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars should be
financed, the cost of the library — should be financed by
bonds payable from taxes on rendered real and personal
property.
It is the policy of the State of Texas that only

5
those who obey the law which does require that everyone
render his property and who do render their property and
pay taxes on it, although the payment of taxes is not a pre­
requisite, should be entitled to vote.
The statutes declare that all property, real,
personal, mixed, except that which is subject to — I'm
sorry — except that which is exempt is subject to taxation
and shall be rendered and listed between January 1st and
April 30th each year until rendition is —
QUESTION:

Mr. Kendall —

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Do you have to render property that is

exempt?
MR. KENDALL:

I believe you do because, for

instance, as to personal property, the exemption is a dollar
amount and 1 don't know how you

would take the exemption

unless you rendered it.
QUESTION:

Well, what happens in practice?

I

gather from reading these briefs that in practice this law
isn't very faithfully observed.
MR. KENDALL:

To be very honest, I don't know.

We

do have in the record that in 1971, I believe, there was
some $4billion in personal property rendered in the State of
Texas that produced taxes of $500 million or so.
figures are

I — these

it is on page 68 and 69 of the Appendix.

6
These figures are part of the stipulation so,
apparently, someone is rendering personal property —
QUESTION:

Well, does that — do they render — in

fact, do people render just the securities they own?

They

don't render tables and chairs, do they, and television sets
and washing machines?
MR. KENDALL:
place to place.'

I just — again, it

varies from

There is some indication in some areas —

cities — automobiles are taxed and in others they are not.
I know that everywhere I have lived in Texas I have alivays
had to pay a tax on my automobile.
QUESTION:

Well, on an automobile —

MR. KENDALL:

I know that in my office in Dallas

when I was in private practice the tax assessor used to come
through the office and list every table and chair we owned.
QUESTION:

Well, but you didn't render them.

He

listed them.
MR. KENDALL:

Well, that is the alternative.

you don't render, he renders for you so it's

If

they are

rendered.
QUESTION:
cation?

Umn hirin', how about this voter qualifi-

If it is not a voluntary action on the part of the

Individual taxpayer and would-be voter, if it is rendered
for him by a tax collector, does that make him eligible?
MR. KENDALL:

I would think that vrould be

considex-ed

—
QUESTION:

Well, it is not what you think.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I was

MR. KENDALL:

wondering what the rule is.

I don't know.

The courts have not

spoken to that but that is considered that your property
has been rendered.
QUESTION:

If it is rendered for you.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

As well as rendered involuntarily.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And in practice — you don’t know what

the facts are — what the actual facts of life are.
MR. KENDALL:

The reason I don’t know is that they

vary from tax assessor and collector to tax assessor and
collector.

The law is very specific that everything must

be —
QUESTION:

Well, I know.

MR. KENDALL:

Some render -- some go out and ~~

very precise, I believe, in listing a person’s property.
Others do not.
QUESTION:

And is this the county?

Is that the

entity?
MR. KENDALL:

Again, it can be the county.

this case it is the city.

It can be the county.

In

It can be

8
a school district,

it can be any other kind of a special

'4»

district.
QUESTION:

Well, does this add up to — you have

tax rolls and the name "Brennan" is on it with some property
listing next to it.

He is eligible to vote because whoever

put it there, his property has been rendered?
MR. KENDALL:

That is correct.

Whether or not you

pay taxes on it.
QUESTION:

Whether it is all my property or a

thousandth part of it, it doesn’t matter.
MR. KENDALL:

It doesn’t matter.

The value

doesn’t matter.
QUESTION:

Whether or not you ever actually paid

taxes, does it?
MR. KENDALL:

That is correct.

That is the holding

of our Supreme Court in the Montgomery case.
QUESTION:

I suppose whether the return or the

rendering of the report is true or false that that is also
true.

He might be — the taxpayer might be liable under some

other statute for rendering a false report.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

And the rendering gets him on the rolls.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

He is on the rolls.
Does he have to be otherwise registered?

MR. KENDALL:

He would also have to be a registered

9
voter, yes.
QUESTION:

But I gather when the assessor goes

through your office, he doesn't look in your safe and find
all the securities there and he just lists your tables and
chairs, you are an ineligible voter.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And I suppose your next point is that

anybody could render property if he wanted to.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

If he v/ants to vote, he can vote.

All

he has to do is render some property and everybody has got
some property to render.
MR. KENDALL:

Exactly.

If I may quote from the

Supreme Court of Texas on this very point ~
QUESTION:
showing no propery?

Well, what if one files a return
Is he then eligible to vote?

MR. KENDALL:

I think he would have to render

property for taxation.
QUESTION:

Well, everybody —

QUESTION:

Even though he possesses no advance.

MR. KENDALL:

That's right.

I'm sorry.

Our position is that everybody — and the Supreme
Court says this, of Texas, says that everybody has property
Everybody has something to render and, in their language —
QUESTION:

At some time during the year, at least

10
QUESTION:

You had a case in Texas, didn’t you,

where five voters rendered $100 each.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And the court held that that —-

MR. KENDALL:

That was Handy against Holman and the

court said, that’s all right, if they want to render $100
each so they can vote, they can do it, and we can’t challenge
it.
QUESTION:

Did the counties determine the rate of

tax or is this determined —
MR. KENDALL:

We have multiple taxing authorities.

A county will determine the rate of taxation

for county

taxes or city taxes, school district taxes, junior college
taxes, hospital district taxes and so on and each one will
determine its own rate, within certain statutory or
constitutional limits.
QUESTION:

And these vary widely across the state?

MR. KENDALL:

Yes, sir.

The Supreme Court in the

Montgomery case said — and I am quoting, "It Is the contention
of the Attorney General and we agree that voter qualifications
of ownership under the Texas constitutional and statutory
provisions stated above, as interpreted by our decisions are
so universal as to constitute no impediment to any elector
who really desires bo vote in a bond election,"
A voter is qualified if he renders any kind of

11
property of any value and he need not have actually paid
the tax.
QUESTION:

That is your case here?

MR. KENDALL:

No, I am sorry, the Montgomery

case at 464 Southwestern 2nd at page 640.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, when one goes to the

polls, I gather — of course, there is the registration —
but how does he prove that —
MR. KENDALL:

He signs an affidavit that he has

rendered at least one piece of property for taxation and —
QUESTION:

He signs an affidavit.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

— he describes that.

I see.

MR. KENDALL:

Yes, sir.

The statutes require

that all property be rendered for state, county taxes, for
taxes of political subdivision and so on and that those who
have duly rendered taxation are qualified to vote.
These provisions are attacked by the Appellees
as being unconstitutional, as invidiously discriminating
against a class, namely, the class of all those who fail to
render their property for taxation, even though our statutes
require that they do render their property.
It is attacked by another group of Appellees who
rendered their property but who now assert that because
who

assert that rendering taxpayers are given a veto, In

12

effect.
In Reynolds against Sims, this Court made it clear
that the classifications of those entitled to vote based on
race, sex, economic status or place of residence were
invidiously discriminatory and would fall.
There Is no justification

constitutionally for

those classifications but the classification, if there is one
under our Texas Constitutional Statutes, is a classification
oi those who obey the law and render their personal property
for taxation whether they pay or not.
Surely, that classification, having nothing to do
with race or sex or economic status or place of residence -QUESTION:

Noxtf, is that true, what you just said?

As I understand it, it is the Texas law that if
one renders an incomplete return or a false return, he
qualifies to vote in this kind of an election.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, if he renders at all.

Well, then, he doesn’t have to file a

complete return, as you just indicated.
I®. KENDALL:

Not for these purposes.

sure it varies from district to district.

Again, I am

The law requires a

complete return and if he fails to file one — and if it is
the policy of che district to enforce the law In that respect
QUESTION:
statute.

He may be prosecuted under some other

13
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Under some other statute, yes.

But do you know, or does the record

show how many people, In fact, file a de minimus return?
MR. KENDALL:

No, sir.

As a matter of fact, the

record doesn't show that there is a single person who did
not file a return.

The record is absolutely silent on that.

We don't know that there is a person who was eligible to
vote in this election who did not file a return.
We know that there are people who voted as not
having filed returns but we don't know that there is a
single person who did not, nor do we know whether there is a
single person who cannot file a return.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, Mr. Kendall, anyway,

speaking now only of the election process —
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Right.

— one goes Into the voting booth and

all he does is sign an affidavit that I have returned $100
cash, furniture, that sort of thing, and the election board
lets him vote.

They don't look behind it.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

No, they do not.

I suppose unless it is challenged.

MR. KENDALL:

If it were challenged, I assume they

would look behind it but I know of no instance, there is
none here that we know of.
QUESTION:

And if it were not true, then he might

14
be subject to some penalty of perjury for making false state­
ments to get into the polling place.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Right.

But is money a renderable?

MR. KENDALL:

Yes, sir, money in the bank Is subject

to rendition.
QUESTION:

Cash in your pocket.

MR. KENDALL:

I guess cash in your pocket would be,

shoes on your feet.
QUESTION:

If any.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Watch on your arm.

What kind of exemptions do you have for

this kind of thing?
MR. KENDALL:

$250 for household goods and fur­

nishings.
QUESTION:

What about —

MR. KENDALL:

So your watch is not exempt, your

clothing ■—
QUESTION:

What' about clothing?

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

No.

No exemption at all?

ME, KENDALL:

No exemption for clothing.

Household

goods and furnishings for $250.
The truth of the matter — well, in Reynolds against
Sircs, this Court said, so long as the divergence is from a

15
strict population standard or based on legitimate consider­
ations incident to the effectuation of a rational state
policy, some deviations from the equal population principle
are constitutionally permissible.
The truth of the matter is that our statutes deny
the right to vote in a bond election to no one, rich, poor,
black, brown, white or for any other reason.

Everyone owns

some property subject to rendition and as I have pointed out,
there is nothing in this record to show that there is anyone
who cannot meet the qualification to vote, who cannot
render.
There are many, many people who do not render
their property for one reason or another personal to them
but there is no evidence in this record that there is anyone
in the City of Fort Worth who could not have rendered
property and who could not have qualified to vote.
QUESTION:

You indicated a little while ago that

someone without any property at all could not render.
MR. KENDALL:

If there is such a person in Fort

Worth, he could not render.

If he absolutely was stark

naked —
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he went in and said, all

I own is a suit of clothes?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Render it.

Render it.

16
QUESTION:

That is rendering it.

Now, and I gather, as I understand what you said
about the Supreme Court opinion, it is immaterial whether
he pays taxes or not.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

He still may vote.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Therefore, it is not like a poll tax

case where you can't vote unless you pay the poll tax.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Even though that is only a dollar or two.

The tax on a suit of clothes might be 50 cents but even if
you don't pay it, you can vote.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

£Inaudible.]

Is there only one day in the year you

can render?
MR. KENDALL:

Oh, no. you can render — by statute,

you can render from January 1st to April 30th, by statute
and I am sure — I think you. can even render after that.
QUESTION:

You iuean on any date within that period

of time, or -—?
MR. KENDALL:

The current year's taxes are rendered

between January 1st and April 30th.
QUESTION:
assessment date?

Yes, but for what day?

What is your

17
ME. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

January 1st.

This, I think, Is what Justice White

is asking.
MR. KENDALL:

Well, it is property owned as of

January 1st is the determinative —
QUESTION:

You could go by — if you

owned —

April 1st, if you could at least remember you had one meal
that day, you could render it.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Could you render saying, I have house­

hold goods and furnishings of a value of $250 and claim my
exemption?

Is that a rendering?
MR. KENDALL:

That is a rendering.

Yes, sir.

You

would not pay any taxes on it.
QUESTION:

But you could vote.

MR. KENDALL:

I believe so.

Yds, sir.

You have

rendered your personal property.
QUESTION:

What about homestead property?

MR. KENDALL:

That also is rendered.

render it to claim a homestead.

You have to

You only claim the home­

stead when you render it.
QUESTION:

But —

oh, you didn't — you don’t pay

any tax at all?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That is right.

Mr. Kendall, I suppose there are

other

18
laws which impose an obligation on you independently of the
right to vote, to render taxable property.
MR. KENDALL:

0h3 yes, sir.

Are there?

There is a whole

section in our statutes having to do with the rendition of
personal property starting with Article 7150, I believe it
is.
QUESTION:

So if you have a $500 bank account and

do not render it, then you have violated Texas law.
MR. KENDALL:

Yes, sir.

The statutes are very specific.

Article 7162 has

some — lists some 42 different things which must be
rendered and then concludes with Section 43, the value of
all qther property not enumerated above, so I don’t know of
anything that that- doesn’t catch and it is —- oh, the number
of goats and the value thereof and so on.

It is that

specific.
QUESTION:

Is there a form provided to

taxpayers

to fill out for rendering property?
MR. KENDALL:

I’m sorry, but I don’t know.

QUESTION:

You have never filled one out

MR. KENDALL:

I have —■ no, I have not because I

yourself?

nave not lived

I have had personal property rendered by

the Taxing Authority for me but I have never gone down and
filled out a form —•

19
QUESTION:

Yes, right.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

— where I rendered.

Well, do you know then itfhether the

rendition or rendering by the authority is a true and
correct rendition, if you haven't done It yourself?
MR. KENDALL:

You mean, whether it is technically

correct as to value or as to what property test —
QUESTION:

Complete as to your holdings.

MR. KENDALL:

I am sure it is not.

I am sure it

is not complete as to my holdings.
QUESTION:

Well, then, how is the Texas system

rational in any way?
MR. KENDALL:

It is uniform — whatever the prac­

tice is, it is uniform and equal within a particular taxing
authority.

The Supreme Court has said that anybody who

wants to vote in one of these bond elections, if he wishes,
may go down and render any amount of property for taxation.
He does not need to pay a tax on it but he has to have some
property rendered.
QUESTION:

Suppose a statute need not be rational

to be constitutional if it doesn’t hurt anybody?

Is that

your case?
MR. KENDALL:

I think that is partly true although

I think there is a certain rationality In this, although it-—
not as it applies to everyone but the theory behind this, I

20
am sure is that if you are going to build a $63860,000
library and pay for it by taxes levied against rendered
property and that is the only way it is going to be paid
for, it is not subject to payment out of other taxes and
if you don’t —
QUESTION:

Mr. Kendallt is there anything in this

record which indicates the difference this statute has made
in voting on these bond issues?
MR. KENDALL:

The only statistics in this record

as to votes is on these two issues which were involved, in the
election in question.
QUESTION:

And by reason of this requirement,

how many people were — votes were not counted?
MR. KENDALL:

Well, all votes are counted.

They

are given different effects.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. KENDALL:

Those who have rendered are counted

and the bond issue carries only if they — a majority of
them and a majority of all —
QUESTION:

Yes, I recall.

MR. KENDALL:

Now, this is — there Is no statute

that provides this method of voting.

This is something

which the Attorney General's predecessor devised as a means
to assure that we could continue to have bond elections.
QUESTION:

So as to get majorities of votes.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Right.

And when you did, then you wore safe.

MR. KENDALL:

That’s right and in this instance

the —
QUESTION:

You did not get over the —-

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

— library issue failed.

Yes.

MR. KENDALL:

It got a majority of those who did

not render, but it did not get a majority of those who did
render and the issue submitted to those who rendered was, or
to all of them was —
QUESTION:

Well,

as

between those who

rendered and those who didn’t render, what were the pro­
portions?
MR. KENDALL:

The exact vote on the library issue

of those who rendered 10,000

or 11,000 voted for and

12,000 voted against.
QUESTION:

So that is of those who rendered?

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

That’s about 21,000.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Those who rendered, 11 to 12.

Right.

And the amount —

MR. KENDALL:

And the non-.renderers, it was

3,700 for and 1,100 against.
QUESTION:

That is what, 6,000 —■ no, 4,500 about.

22
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

^,800 and it is about three to one —■

21.000 who rendered and 5,000 \tfho didn’t.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Right.

Those who didn’t render violated the law,

didn’t they?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

They violated the law.

Well, what do you do to them?

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, in what —

By not rendering their property.

MR. KENDALL:

By not rendering.

That, again, is

up to the local taxing authorities as to what they will do,
ir anything and —
QUESTION:

Well, what does the statute say as to

sanctions for not rendering?
MR. KENDALL:

I have not found any.

QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

You hope there aren’t.

[Laughter.]
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Probably.

Well, why do some -- I mean, I realize

it Is necessarily speculative, some of these — but why do
a lot of people render and some people not render?

Is it just

a question of whether you want to pay taxes or not?
MR. KENDALL:

Well, of course, one reason for

rendering would be if you like to vote in this type of

23

election.

That is one reason.
Another is that I think you are probably under

some more of an obligation to render absolutely everything
if you do it yourself because you have to render under
oath and state that that is all the property you have.
Whereas,

if you leave it up to the —
QUESTION:

Or is it simply has'the assessor has

got around?
MR. KENDALL:- Well, the assessor, for instance,
goes to the automobile license rolls and he —
county I have lived

in every

in and I get a tax bill for my auto­

mobile, a property tax bill on my cars where he has rendered
them for me but he doesn't — except in my business — he
doesn’t come in my home and —
QUESTION:

As I reflect for a moment on this, in

the two states I have lived in as a legal resident,
Minnesota and now Virginia, that is precisely what a great
number of people do.
report.

They just don’t bother to make a

They permitted the assessor to levy for household

goods a fixed percentage of the value of their home as the
alternative and then the automobile was taken off of the
automobile list.

So I guess —

MR. KENDALL:

Yes, I think most people I know

don’t render their homes.

They are surely taxed but the

only time you do anything about it is If you feel that they

24
have been unjustly evalued and then you go down to the Board
of

Equalisation and complain about it but otherwise you just,

you get a notice that they have rendered it at a certain
figure and you accept it.
The cases upon which the Appellees rely I think
are easily

distinguishable.

First was Kramer, the Kramer

case and that case involved an election of a board, a school
board and the decision was, essentially, to enforce the oneman, one-vote rule in the absence of some compelling state
interest to deny the franchise to all bona fide residents.
Then Chief Justice Warren declined to express an
opinion as to whether the state in some circumstances might
limit the exercise of the franchise to those primarily
interested or primarily affected because there he found
everybody was equally interested and affected.
In a dissent written by Justice Stewart, it was
said that they were unable to see any distinction between
the permissible limitations and those imposed in the Kramer
case and Mr. Justice Stewart went on to say, and I am quoting,
So long as the classification is rationally related to a
permissible legislative end, therefore, as are residence,
literacy and age requirements proposed with respect to voting,
there is no general denial of equal protection.
The Cipriano case —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, If you are dealing

25
with our cases. Counsel, maybe —
MR. KENDALL:

Right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

— it would be a good

time to hear from your friend and see whether you have any
comments after he gets through, if you have covered your
major points.
MR. KENDALL:

I think I have, if the Court please.

I would like to make one other point and that is
that this election is not a vote on whether or not to build
the library.

It is a vote on whether this is how it would

be financed.
The City Council determines whether the library is
built.

The City Council may build it with funds from the

Federal Government, from some foundation or from some other
sources.
The question here is whether these people who
render property may be those who are entitled to vote on
whether that is the financing to be used for the library.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gladden.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON GLADDEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GLADDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
If I may go right into Mr. Justice Stewart's
question relative to the practical application of the Texas

26

law as it applies to personal property or the taxing structure
What the situation is, all real estate is easily
identifiable and assessed by the county tax assessor and the
governmental entities that assess and levy taxes.
Personal property in Texas — and, incidentally, I
cite in our brief 51 Texas Law Pieview 885,"The Property Tax
in

Texas Under State and Federal Law” by Professor Yudov

fairly well outlines our facts as those being the same facts
in the Stewart case arising in the State of Louisiana and
that is that you have an all-encompassing reference to all
property within the state being taxable and then as a prac­
tical matter the collection is restricted to real estate and
business property which is easily discernible.
Counsel’s reference to his law library being taxed
in Dallas is one of those business assessments that is made
after the time for personal rendition takes place.
From a practical standpoint, about the only taxes
that are levied in Texas are taxes on real estate, taxes on
business personalty and in about ^00 taxing districts, taxes

QUESTION:

Hoitf about intangible personal property?

I'm talking about securities.
MR. GLADDEN:

None.

There are, from a practical

standpoint, no intangible personal property is either
voluntarily rendered nor is there any facility available for

27
the tax assessor to go out and locate and Identify.

He does

not go to the banks and assess bank accounts unless it is
a business-oriented or a business-committed —
QUESTION:

Do you have a state income tax?

ME. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we do not.

Well, how do you raise all this money

that you are —
MR. GLADDEN:

By ad valorem taxes on real property

and business personalty is where the money comes from.
QUESTION:

And that is it.

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Well, we have a sales tax.

Yes, a sales tax, but no state income

tax.
MR. GLADDEN:

We have no state income tax.

We have

a city sales tax as well as a state sales tax.
QUESTION:

What happens if I go and, say, use your

words in Texas that I want to render $100 worth of personal
property?
MR. GLADDEN:

Well, it's kind of hard to do.

Mr. Kendall kind of pointed up that it just isn’t done,
Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

You’d hardly -—

QUESTION:

Well, I am saying when you go to vote.

MR. GLADDEN:
rendered it.

You must have already previously

QUESTION:

Well, I can send a letter to the

rendering agency and say I hereby render.
MR. GLADDEN:

All right, that is —if you do that,

and you are willing to sign an affidavit to the effect that
you have rendered taxable property.
Now, I disagree with Mr. Kendall.

Article 3(A) does

not say rendition of non-taxable property qualifies you to
vote.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said all intangible

property was taxable.
MR. GLADDEN:

Except for this $250 exemption,

perhaps.
‘

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GLADDEN:

But what Section 3(A) says — and

this is the section that we are complaining of — it provides
that a person who is already qualified must also be a person
who has rendered property — excuse me

tax — well, first

of all, the city ordinance says that it must be tax-paying
voters,

The —
QUESTION:

The ordinance Is different from the —

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes, the city ordinance --

—- state provision.

MR. GLADDEN:

The city ordinance makes reference

to tax payers.
QUESTION:

Yes.

29
MR. GLADDEN:

Persons who are tax payers.

The

state statute says, provided that a majority of the qualified
property tax-paying voters of the district, and in an
election to be held for that purpose, whose shall vote
such tax.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gladden, are you suggesting dis­

agreement now with Mr. Kendall?
When I asked him earlier, suppose one simply went
in and signed an affidavit and said I rendered a suit of
clothes, that is all I own, and he said that if one did that
at the polling place he would be permitted to vote.
MR. GLADDEN:

No, sir.

Oh, if you say that

you

did do that, yes.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Would you then be able and

permitted to vote?
MR. GLADDEN:

Yes.

And, of course, if you had

committed a fraud and had not rendered that suit of clothes
for tax purposes, then -—
QUESTION:

But you did.

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

But if you had, yes.

If you had.

Then you would be permitted

to vote.
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

I am satisfied that is true, yes.

So one doesn’t have to pay the tax on

che suit of clothes, 50 cents, 25 cents, whatever it might be.

30
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Presumably.

Well, in that sense * as I read Judge

Thornberry's opinion, one of the grounds on which he found
this unconstitutional was that it is like the Poll Tax case
or Harper case but you had to pay the poll tax before you
could vote, but here, as I understand it, if I correctly
understand you, you don't have to pay the tax on the suit of
clothes.

As long as you have rendered the suit of clothes,

then you may vote.

Is that right?

MR. GLADDEN:

Well, this is correct because, as I

say, again, the Stewart situation, which this Court summarily
affirmed, applies that from a practical standpoint, there is
no rendition of personalty.
The tax assessor, after April 1st, has the authority
to and does go to business people and does determine how much
of Mr. Kendall's library or his value of his law library.

He

does not go out to his house and inventory his personalty.
QUESTION:
taxpayers?

Well, where were the 23,000 rendering

Were they all owners of businesses?
MR. GLADDEN:

They were all owners of real estate,

your Honor, in most instances — in most instances.
QUESTION:

Or automobiles?

MR. GLADDEN:

Not in Port Worth.

The City of Port

Worth does not even undertake to assess private, personal
automobiles, business automobiles only.

31
QUESTION:

Is there any way of telling from this

record what the nature of the property rendered was on
behalf of the 23.,000 who said they had rendered?
MR. GLADDEN:

No, there is no.

There are some

references into it as to the amount of dollar revenues that
come from personalty versus realty but there is no reference
as to whether that came from business interests

which — of

course, corporate interests, they have no right to vote in
this type of situation and, of course, corporate interests
are the
QUESTION:

So the record doesn't shed any light on

the type of property rendered by these 23,000.
MR. GLADDEN:

No.

But let me, if I may, back up

and kind of outline the facts situation as to this election
and as to the procedures that have been followed to shed
maybe, the circumstances where we are confused.
First of all, prior to the three-judge court
decision in Phoenix, in Texas only persons who had rendered
property and in that instance, for all practical purposes,
only persons whose property had been rendered by the tax
assessor, that being real estate, were privileged to exercise
the ballot.
following Cipriano and the three—judge court in
Phoenix, the Attorney General's office established this dual
election process whereby he in turn said, In order to preserve

32
the validity of bonds pending this Court’s determination of
the Constitution as it applies to Texas, we will set up a
dual election process and that is, those people who come in
to we will, for the first time, let, in essence, non-real
property owners come into the ballot box.
But we will segregate their ballots and have them
cast in one box and those who are willing to affirm rendition
of taxable property in another box and then we

will have a

record as to what the facts are when and if the federal
courts decide that our state law is unconstitutional.
This has been the procedure that has been followed
in Texas since 1969., since the District Court decision in
Phoenix and this Court’s decision in Cipriano and Kramer.
QUESTION:

Well, you say the breakdown is between

real property taxpayers on the one hand and those who have
affirmed the rendition of personal property on the other?
MR. GLADDEN:

No.

The rendition — what happens

is, if a person comes into the ballot box or into the polling
place, he is afforded, since Phoenix and since the District
Court decision in Phoenix, ince '69 — he is afforded an
opportunity to sign one of two pieces of paper.
One piece of paper said, "I own and have rendered
property subject to taxation in the City of Forth Worth and I
therefore am entitled to vote over in this box.”
then the election judge —•

All right,

33
QUESTION:

And fchey don’t have to say what the

property was, just "I own and have rendered."
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And as a matter of practical fact you

are telling us that anybody who was in that box would be a
person who otmed real estate —
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Or business.

Or a proprietor of a business that

owned property.
MR. GLADDEN:

Which had been assessed by the tar.

assessors.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GLADDEN:

Which the tax assessor initiated the

placing of him on the rolls.
QUESTION:

As a matter of practical fact, then --

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, right.

— it would be those people only would

fall into that category.
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

But what is in the other box?

Okay, in the other box, they come in

and, as I say, from '69 forward.

Up until 1969 they

were

not even privileged to come on the premises —
QUESTION:

No, no, but I mean —

MR. GLADDEN:

But from ’69 forward, they sign a

statement to the effect, "I have not rendered any property

34
within the taxing district," and they say, "Okay, you go vote
over in that box,”
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GLADDEN:

So then we have the sanctity of the

real property or, for practical standpoints, the real property
owners preserved in that instance and then we also have to
tabulate' for no purpose, actually, I think under Montgomery,
the remaining straw poll of those persons whi have neither
rendered their property nor had the tax assessor come by
their business and render it for them.
QUESTION:

And although you say that as — you have

said as a matter of practice it tends to be real property or
business personai^y that is rendered, so far as the record
has shown, on these 23,000 voters here who rendered, the
record does not show what type of property they rendered.
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

This is quite correct.

It could have been somebody who was

interested enough to write a letter and say,!iI hereby render
$100 worth of property and P.S., this is because I want to
vote," and then he goes in and he will be perfectly qualified
to vote.
MR. GLADDEN:

He very well could have; if he renders

it and, of course, then he is on the tax rolls and the tax
assessor sends him a bill the next year for his proportionate
share, assuming that he has taxable property.

MR. GLADDEN:
confusion.

And so then we add additional

The Attorney General’s position was — was, I

am not going to certify and it is his statutory responsibil
ity of certifying the validity of the bonds and they are
not saleable otherwise ~ the Attorney General’s position
was that but then, Montgomery, which was a mandamus suit
brought by a school district against the Attorney General
seeking 'to require him to certify where there had been a
split, where the aggregate carried but it did not carry
in the property owner box and the Texas Supreme Court said,
in essence, as I read it, that neither the Attorney General
nor the ‘Phoenix case applies and that Article 3 of Section
6 of the Texas Constitution just says, real property owners
period.

Or, not real property —
QUESTION:

Not real property.

MR. GLADDEN:

It says, persons who have rendered

property for taxation.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GLADDEN:

And so I think that Montgomery

backed away from the position of the Attorney General in
this make-shift kind of a we’ll do it both ways, we’ll look
at the aggregate and give the aggregate veto power but not
approval power.
QUESTION:

But the Attorney General nonetheless

wenc on to continue with

his system.

35
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t he first have to write a

letter and say, "What do you mean by rendering?”
MR. GLADDEN:

Yes and, of course, this is the

question that we have been facing and we only had 4,500
people vote in this election because it was a first-time
experience and when you went In, even the election judges
couldn't tell you what rendition meant and we found ourselves
in a situation where people — in the newspaper, two-column,
I think, there is an exhibit where there is a two-column
story on the front page of the newspaper explaining why,
for the first time, people who don't own real estate are
privileged to come and express their opinions though they
will not be considered by the Attorney General of Texas for
the purpose of determining the validity or the issuance of
bonds.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the Attorney General,

after he went into this two-box system under what he under" *

stood to be the compulsion of the Phoenix case —
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— and Kramer, that he then didn't

certify that the bonds were valid unless there was a majority
of both the rendering people and a majority of the total.
MR. GLADDEN:

This is correct.

decided.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Then Montgomery was

37
MR, GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, in order to —

In order to play it safe.

MR. GLADDEN:

In contemplation of the Court's

ruling in this case., I think.
If this Court does not —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GLADDEN:

— uphold the lower court, the dual

balloting system will be dispensed with and we will go back
to the initial Section 3(A) of those persons who owned
properties which have been rendered for tax purposes.
QUESTION:

There is one other little fish hook in

this case and that Is that the Port Worth ordinance seems to
require something additional.
MR. GLADDEN:

It certainly does.

It requires that

you —
QUESTION:

Pay taxes.

MR. GLADDEN:

—■ pay taxes and I think that Section

3(A) contemplates the payment of taxes.
QUESTION:

The purpose —

It doesn’t say so.

MR. GLADDEN:

No.

The purpose — and if you will read Montgomery and
if you will read the whole line in Counsel’s brief, the
purpose of this taxing of this provision is to collect taxes,
not sufferage and of course, under the Poll Tax case, the
lines drawn, the requirements of this Court in limiting

33
sufferage — once that you afford everybody the opportunity
to vote, you say people are qualified to vote in elections
and then you say, in bond elections you narrow it to a
special group of people.

Then it has to be tailored to fit

the purpose of and I hardly need to suggest that Section
3 of the Constitution certainly has not been tailored to
collect very many taxes.
QUESTION:

I don't quite understand, if your

Supreme Court has said, rendition entitles you to vote,
notwithstanding you don't pay the tax, how can your city
have an ordinance which requires you to pay the tax as a
condition of voting?
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

It is there. It is in conflict —

Well, can the ordinance stand up

against that interpretation?
MR. GLADDEN:
ordinance.

At this point we are attacking the

For the first time it has been attacked —
QUESTION:

Well, what is at issue in this case,

the ordinance?
MR. GLADDEN:

The issue in this case is sufferage,

whether —
QUESTION:

Is the ordinance?

Is the ordinance or

the state statute?
MR. GLADDEN:

Both the state statute, the state

constitutional provisions and the ordinance.

39
QUESTION:

Well, they are different.

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Which is which?

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

And they are all different.

I beg your pardon?

Which is which?

If It were only the

ordinance, I don’t suppose the three-judge court would have
any jurisdiction.
MR. GLADDEN:

Well, of course, we attacked the

Attorney General's certification or refusal to certify and.
that gave it statewide application because we are attacking
the state constitutional provisions which was set out in the
Phoenix case and referred to in the Phoenix case.
QUESTION:

Because the three-judge court puts them

both in the same boat.

In his description at the outset he

talks about the — in one breath about the laws of the state
and of the city charter.
MR. GLADDEN:

Now, this is not true.

city charter requires the payment of taxes.
QUESTION:

This — the

The —

Well, he talks about them both the same,

the same way.
MR. GLADDEN:

Well, they are fldderent and in the

City's brief which, incidentally, the City filed a brief as
8X1

Appellee but in support of Appellant's contention.
There are some briefs by some other taxing districts

or some other districts Including the El Paso Junior College

40
District, which was statutorily created by majority vote
and given the power to assess taxes by a majority but
restricted in bond elections to issue bonds for capital
improvements to go back and obtain not just a general
majority-qualified voter but go to the property — those
persons itfho had rendered property for tax purposes to issue
those bonds.

They are in support of our position.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gladden.

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

In the election that you have been

talking about, was the Fort Worth ordinance applied?
As I understood what you said earlier, a voter who
entered the booth or the polling place was given the
opportunity of going in one of two voting booths.

In one,

he would sign a certificate of some sort saying he had
rendered property.
Was he also required, in Fort Worth, to say that
he not only rendered it but paid taxes?
MR. GLADDEN:

I am not sure what the language — I

think the language probably was drawn in the — and a copy
of that is in exhibit — I think it was probably dratvn on
the state affidavit concept and that is, I own taxable
property which has been rendered for tax purposes.
I disagree with Mr. Kendall that non-taxable items,
household goods, a rendition of household goods only __

QUESTION:

So —

MR. GLADDEN:

— would not constitute rendition of

taxable property.
QUESTION:

So it may be that —

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice —

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

If it is understood.

Right, excuse me.

I was simply going to ask whether, if

the ordinance was not applied in this case, we have that
ordinance or its validity before us.
MR. GLADDEN:

I am not sure that you do have, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Another question I wanted to ask about

the certificates that one signs, is that — does that
signature enjoy the secrecy of the ballot box?

Or is your

name signed to it and your name then made available to the
taxing authorities?
MR. GLADDEN:

Now, it is not a secret.

It is an

available thing that is on file along with all the other
election returns.

The list of those persons who voted in

this box and that box together with the supporting signature
on the thing that comes in is available to the taxing
authorities.
QUESTION:
the ballot.

It is a separate piece of paper from

42
MR. GLADDEN:

Yes.

It is a roll that you come in

and as I say, they separate you as you come in depending
upon which one of these particular declarations that you
sign.
QUESTION:

0hs you sign your name on a book,

perhaps.
MR. GLADDEN:

Yes, on a sheet of paper which is

numbered in terms of a registration that I appeared here
today and I voted.
The particular instance, though, is that there is
no evidence of the utility of this by any taxing authority
to go out and render or to find out whether that person
really does have, or to collect any taxes from that person
and so for — my position is, in terms of the constitutional
application, there are other means by which to collect
taxes.
There are far better means than that which is not
exercised, though it is on the books.
QUESTION:

I was going to say, you can really —

it makes a big difference to me whether or not that
ordinance was applied to those who are permitted to vote as
having rendered.
MR. GLADDEN:

Your Honor, I think I can, in just

a moment's time, locate the language.
QUESTION:

Okay.

h3

MR GLADDEN:

The ordinance was not applied.

The

language on the certificate was couched in the terms of the
state constitutional provisions which said, "I own taxable
property in the district and it has been duly rendered for
tax purposes."
QUESTION:

So the ordinance really wasn’t —

MR. GLADDEN:

Did not impair the participation,

that is correct.
QUESTION:

So when you say here, attacking the

ordinance, did you mean by that, attacking it before this
Court?
MR. GLADDEN:

Yes, we raised the —- we filed the

suit in the lower courts —
QUESTION:

Well, those don’t apply.

QUESTION:

Well, only to the extent that it goes

as far as the state law.
MR. GLADDEN:

That is right.

The ordinance

provided that no bond shall be issued unless authority shall
first be submitted to the qualified voters who pay taxes
but it was treated from a standpoint, again from the news
media coverage of this and from all other purposes, as being,
equating the same as rendition, either Involuntary —
QUESTION:

If he were liable to pay taxes,

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

And —

When was this rather unique provision

adopted in Texas?
MR, GLADDEN:

The Texas Constitution, I think —

this was adopted in 1879 and then amended in 1932, I believe.
It is my under—
QUESTION:

Was it carried over from the days

when it was an independent republic?
MR. GLADDEN:

No, I am not sure whether or not

It was In the provisions prior to — independent republic,
we went out in 1845 and became a state that year and 1879
was the last constitution that we adopted.

This was

deliberated on, as I recall or as I — as the historic
background was, it was deliberated on by that Constitution
Convention and it was resolved that property owners were
the ones that ought to be imposed long-term obligations on,
on the ad valorem tax base and that has carried forward —
was carried forward up until the Phoenix decision was
rendered and then it — as I say, this modified approach
has been taken since the District Court In the Phoenix case.
We feel like that this Court, in the Phoenix case
outlined —- looked at the Texas Constitution and footnoted
the 14 states that had no unique problems in levying and
collecting taxes and in turn, found that phoenix could get
by with — or the City of Phoenix could get by in its
taxing procedures Xfithout imposing sufferage or imposing an
additional requirement on a person’s right to vote.

45
That was not tailored to satisfy an imperative
need of the state and I think: that is our situation in this
case.

We have a circumstance where, if there is no

classification, then there is no need to impose an additional
requirement on a voter that he have made some kind of a
declaration to somebody at some time prior to the time he
enters that booth that has not been acted upon, that has
never been used as a basis upon which to levy and collect
taxes, to add that additional requirement and no evidence,
Mr. Kendall —
QUESTION:

However little inconvenience is

involved.
MR. GLADDEN:

However little Inconvenience.

QUESTION:

It is too much constitutionally in the

way of a burden.
MR. GLADDEN:

I think the right of suf.ferage,

Mr. Justice, is one that — that we need to encourage
rather than discourage.
QUESTION:

Well, it is about — almost as burden­

some as requiring them to register.
MR. GLADDEN:

It is -— well, it — no, registration

I think you have got to go down to the county courthouse and
find somebody there who has to go ask somebody where you
find —

46
QUESTION:

All you have to do is write a letter.

You just write a letter.
MR. GLADDEN:

No, no, I think you have got to

render it under oath, according to the statutes.
QUESTION:

You must —

But even so, even if it is only

writing a letter, you still suggest that where something
is

filed, even that is too much.
MR. GLADDEN:

can

Yes, yes.

I think that before you

limit franchise or create a subclass of qualified

voters that are going to pass on something such as library
bonds or such as financing capital assets of a junior
college district, you have got to have some rational basis
for restricting that vote to persons who have rendered
property for taxation and Texas has just wholly failed —
Arizona wholly failed and it is an interesting thing that
our sister state of Oklahoma in 1969, twice, ruled on that
question and found that that kind of a requirement was
constitutional and then in 1971, following this Court’s
decision in Phoenix, reversed itself and granted an
injunction against the application of

such a city ordinance

and said, we are going to follow what the Supreme Court said
in Phoenix and right about the same time that the Supreme
Court of Oklahoma was doing that, the Supreme Court of Texas
was saying, without talking about restricting voting, without
talking about tailoring the restriction to fit the

47
particular function or need that the state had but just
summarily said, we don’t think there is anything wronp; with
making people pay their fair share of the taxes and the tax
assessor must exhaust every means of ferreting out and
locating Mr. Kendall's personal property that he has failed
to render but has had a portion of it rendered by the tax
assessor and thus qualify him to vote.
1 suggest that, while there may be, it may not be
the wealth qualification that was raised in the Poll Tax, it
still is an additional requirement that there is no rational
basis for.
Ic does not assist in the collection of taxes
because there has never been any effort on the part of and
there is no evidence in the record that the tax assessor has
made him —these records available to him to render those
things declared.
QUESTION:

Well, would you expect £hat to be in the

record of a district court proceedings When you are talking
about the rational basis for a legislative requirement?

And

there is a presumption, isn't there, that the legislature
may have had a reason for doing something and I wouldn’t
think it is incumbent on the state to produce evidence before
the three-judge district court that they, in fact, used this
mechanism.

MR. GLADDEN:

I think it is in Phoenix.

I think

Phoenix placed a burden that when you restrict the
franchise from the general franchise classification to a
special franchise within that classification that it is
incumbent upon the state to show that there ‘was some
imperative necessity to do that in support of a compelling
state interest.
QUESTION:

And

did you prove it by live witnesses

and testimony at the District Court hearing?
MR. GLADDEN:

There were no live witnesses.

We

stipulated all the evidence and there was suggestion —
there was some testimony by the city tax assessor that it
is important that we have taxes
QUESTION:

to run our city.

Well, my suggestion is that your -- the

rational basis for a legislative enactment isn’t something
you ordinarily produce by question and answer testimony
in a hearing before the three-judge District Court.

That is

frequently something that is simply argued on the basis of
whether it is arbitrary and so forth.
So your suggestion that the record doesn’t contain
anything I would find by no means conclusive.
MR. GLADDEN:

Well, I think this.

£ think that

the Court — the Court in Kramer found that before there is
a subclassification, a special classification of voters and,
again, that classification — or, there has to be some basis—
QUESTION:

Compelling state interest.

49
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Compelling state interest and —

And, of course, that, you can’t prove

ever.
MR. GLADDEN:

This is a difficult thing to prove

and I appreciate Mr. Justice Stewart’s awareness of the
difficulty in proving it.

But that is the lav; and it was

reaffirmed in Sa3.yer wherein this Court said, Phoenix is
the law and Kramer is the law and before you can restrict a
person’s voting privilege and deny one person the right to
vote, if he is

in the general category of —

QUESTION:

In Salyer, we stated the holdings of

the Phoenix and Cipriano cases.
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, this is correct.

I don’t regard that as a reaffirmance

of them.
MR. GLADDEN:

Well, I am sorry.

I so construed it

as being, in essence, a finding that that was still the law
and —
QUESTION:

Mr. Gladden, up to this point, until

just now, you haven’t mentioned either Salyer or Toltec.
MR. GLADDEN:

Okay.

I don’t think they have any

application at all because people who want to go to use the
library are not as identifiable in terms of benefit

and

burden as there was in each of those cases.
I think that that is a clear distinction.

I think

50
that — ands agains Stewart3 the three-judge court in
Stewart said that just the fact that you pay the taxes
does not create a compelling state interest so as to restrict
a person to — or restrict sufferage to determine whether or
not we have a library or a viable junior college district
with some buildings.
QUESTION:

But your friend told us that this vote

had nothing whatever to do with whether there was going to
be a library but only as to what mode of financing was to
be used.
MR. GLADDEN:

The answer to it is that unless

there are 6.8 million — now, we don’t have a library.

We

had two issues *— and this is in the record — we had two
issues submitted.

We had an issue on whether or not we

bought a public transportation system.

That carried in the

property owner box, in the nonproperty owner box and in the
aggregate.

We bought the bus system and we have got buses

running.
We had another issue submitted the same day on the
question of whether or not we authorized — not compelled
but authorized the City Council of Port Worth to issue bonds
for the purpose of constructing a library, $6.8 million.
That carried in the property owner box.
carried in the aggregate.
excuse me.

That

But it failed in the — no,

It carried in the non-property owner box.

It

51
carried in the aggregate but it failed in the property
owner box.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GLADDEN:

The Attorney General of the State of

Texas says, I will not certify those bonds and absent that,
we don't have the money to build us a library.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that vote, on the basis of

what you both have said, simply a sort of a local Gallup
Poll on whether there should be a library?
The City Council has the final decision, he said,
your friend said.
MR. GLADDEN:

The City Council does not because at

this moment they can't issue those bonds unless it carried
in those who have rendered property for tax purposes.
QUESTION:

So —

They could build it out of general

revenues if they had them, I take it.
MR. GLADDEN:

If they had general revenue they

could do so but from in terms of creating a lien against the
ad valorem tax structure, they cannot do so absent

approval

of property owners.
QUESTION:

What are the sources of revenue in

Fort Worth other than real estate and personal property
taxes?
MR. GLADDEN:

The city — okay, primarily the city

has real estate, personal property taxes and a city sales tax

52
of one percent of the gross sales within — one percent of
the gross sales within the city.
QUESTION:

Is that in addition to the state sales

tax?
I-®. GLADDEN:

Yes3 it is in addition to and has

to have a referendum vote In that particular metropolitan
area where they make the

assessment.

The City of Fort

Worth does have a city sales tax.
QUESTION:

Do you have any licensing taxes?

MR. GLADDEN:

Oh, yes, we do have some — nos

licensing taxes were stricken.

There used to be a state

licensing cax that the city piggy-backed on but it was
repealed and so the licensing tax failed.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTj.CE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. KENDALL., ESQ.
MR. KENDALL:

If I may just take a minute or two.

I think there is one other source, Mr. Justice
Powell.

There is revenue-sharing which has furnished funds

for a great many improvements in the State of Texas but I
don’t think that necessarily governs.
I think, really — I started out stating our
position in this and Mr. Gladden hasn’t answered it yet and
I don’t think he can because of the decision in the

53
Montgomery case, and that is, that there is no class — there
is no class being discriminated against.

Everybody in Texas

qualifies to be a — to render property for taxation.
They may or they may not choose to do so.

I

take

issue with what Mr. Gladden said about nobody in Tarrant
County renders.

I don't know where he gets that.

That is not, certainly, in the record.
In the Handley case, as the Chief Justice pointed
out, the facts were that 40 taxpayers rendered $100 so that
they could vote in an election, so that is a possibility.
But there is nothing In this record
QUESTION:

In Port Worth —

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

What?

In Port Worth, how could a man render

his personal property?
MR. KENDALL:

Go doxtfn to the tax assessor and

collector's office and —
V

•

QUESTION:

h

Well, ivhat would he be taxed for?

Does Port Worth have a tax on personal property?
MR. KENDALL:

Yes, sir, very definitely.

The

statistics in the record show that of their property tax is
some — they have a total of about a million four hundred
thousand dollars on the ad valorem tax rolls, so that
,000

I’m sorry, 352 million is personal property that

is subject to taxation in Tarrant County at Port Worth.

54

QUESTION:

What is that personal property?

Homes?

MR. KENDALL: No, homes don’t come as ad valorem.
They are real property but I don't know what it is comprised
of.

It's — It can be anything but real property and the

record is silent.
QUESTION:

It could be automobiles and boats,

couldn’t it?
MR. KENDALL:
fur coats.

Automobiles or boats.

It could be

It could be bank deposits, securities.
QUESTION:

Well, don't we have to know what?

QUESTION: Cadillacs.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:
Port Worth.

Cadillacs, yes, sir.

Well, he says you don't tax cars in

Now, do you or don’t you?

MR. KENDALL:

Well, I don't know where that comes

from because certainly not from the record In this case.
QUESTION:

Well, we don’t have much of anything on

this record, do we?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Noc as to xvhether or not ——

Because I don't know what rendering is

yet.
MR. KENDALL:

There is nothing in this record as

to whether or not there are people in Port Worth _
QUESTION:
I don’t know.

You know, you render gristle and fat.

55
QUESTION:

In order to make lard.

QUESTION:

You make lard out of rendering.

Is

that what you do to taxes?
MR. KENDALL:

Sometimes I suspect that maybe they

do something like that but they — as I understand the
rendition as they speak of it here, it Is either going to
the assessor and collector’s office or having him come to
your home or your office or wherever and you submit a list
of your property for taxation, or if you don't submit one,
he submits one for you.
Now, Mr. Gladden mentioned — I don’t
know what its importance is, that this was the only library
that Port Worth had and the record again Is silent but in
the brief submitted by the city attorney for the City of
Port Worth, it said, the "Library district being for the sole
purpose of constructing a new central library in addition
to the present seven branch libraries and the existing
central downtown library."
bo the question here was whether this is the way
we are going to finance them and the city council, even if
this bond issue passed, if the voters had to vote It over­
whelmingly in favor of a bond issue to build a library, there
is no -— there is nothing to compel the City Council to

go

forward with that.
As a matter of fact, because of rising prices, we

56
find very often we'll pass a bond issue to build a new
public building and then when we get around to build it,
we find that the bond issue wasn't enough.
QUESTION:

It was just an authorizing vote.

MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

You find that in any municipality.

MR. KENDALL:
bonds.

It was an authorizing —

They may find they can't sell the

There are lots of things that can come between this

election and the building of the building.
I want to point out, if I may that Montgomery
involved another section of the Constitution also which
specifically referred to taxpaying voters and nevertheless,
they said they did not have to pay taxes to

qualify as

voters.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
[Whereupon, at 3:16 o’clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
