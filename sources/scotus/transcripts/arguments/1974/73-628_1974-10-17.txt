HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Allenberg Cotton Company against Pittman.
Mr. McQuiston, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN McQUISTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McQUISTON:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
What this case involves is whether, in the

State

of Mississippi, you can require foreign corporations to
obtain a license to buy cotton in Mississippi and ship it
from the state.
My client, the Allenberg Cotton Company, buys
cotton in the State of Mississippi without having any
employees in the state, without an office in the state,
without owning any warehouses in the state and without even
paying for the cotton in the state and it buys that cotton
for the purpose of shipping every bale of cotton that it
buys out of the State of Mississippi.
Allenberg made the contract that is involved here
following an industry pattern which has been established
over the last 100 or more years.
Like almost every other cotton merchant in the
south, Allenberg bids for the cotton over the telephone.

4
In a prior year they did this over the telegraph and it
submits those bids to local cotton brokers all over the
south and makes contracts in that manner without qualifi­
cation to do business in the various states where bids are
submitted and contracts are made.
This pattern of activity follows a pattern which
has been protected under the commerce clause, particularly
in the

agriculture-merchandising industry as shown in the

decisions of Dahnke-Talker "'tilling Company, Lemke versus
Farmers Grain Company and Shafer versus Farmers Grain
Company, all of which established the rule that making
purchases to buy commodities for shipment out of state is an
an
activity which is/exempted state licensing and qualification
requirement by the commerce clause.
This principle was articulated recently by this
Court in the Eli Lilly decision.

In

that decision, all

nine of the justices recognized the principle that the
commerce clause guarantees free access to all markets in the
United States and that as long as a foreign corporation
limits Its activities in a state to those essential
activities which are necessary to transact business in
interstate commerce, that corporation should be free from
local licensing or qualification requirements.
Q

What decision was that?
MR. McQUISTON:

The Eli Lilly decision,

Mr. Justice Douglas.
Q

Eli Lewis?
MR. McQUISTON:

Q

Lilly.

Lilly.
MR. McQUISTON:

I'm sorry.

I have a very had

cold.
Q

Did you cite it in your brief?
MR. McQUISTON:

Yes, I do.

The principle we cited

it for is the principle that —
Q

I see it.

Thank you.

MR. McQUISTON:

Thank you.

What Allenberg did in this case fits into a very
well-established industry pattern and into the pattern of
existing lav;.

In January, 1971, Pitman, a substantial

Mississippi cotton planter, went to a local cotton broker
and asked him to get a certain price for his cotton.

The

local cotton broker picked up the phone and telephoned the
Allenberg Cotton Company in Memphis and, after some
negotiations over the telephone, a contract was entered
into.
As is the custom in the trade, Allenberg
immediately made offsetting sales of cotton on the New York
Cotton Exchange and to its meal customers outside the State
of Mississippi.
Q

Whose agent, if anybody's, is the broker?
MR. McQUISTON:

The broker is really a joint agent.

6
The broker has a clientele, like all of these brokers across
the south that are the local cotton producers.

They come to

him or he may go to them and the broker puts the buyer and
seller together and he is paid a per-bale commission which
is added to the price of the cotton.
Sometimes it comes out of the farmer's pockets.
Sometimes the commission comes out of the buyer's pocket,
but in all cases it is added to the price of the cotton.
Q

And title is never in the broker's name, is it?
MR. McQUISTON:

Title is never in the broker's

name.
Q

This broker acted for others also?
MR. McQUISTON:

Yes, he did, in prior years.

In

the particular year involved in this case, he did not buy
any cotton for any other company.
him.

It was his own choice.

himself.

But we didn’t restrict

He actually acted as a merchant

His was buying cotton for his own account during

that year and acting — running his own little small cotton
merchandising business and on the side he was contracting
cotton for Allenberg.
Q

But he acted for several producers?
MR. McQUISTON:

He acted for a number of different

farmers in that year.
Q

But only for you as the buyer.
MR. McQUISTON:

Farmers?

Only for us.

7
Q

In that year.
HR, McQUISTON:

But that was his own choice.

It

was just a coincidence.
Q

Pie wasn’t — you didn’t have any —
MR. McQUISTON:

We had no control over whether he

did or he did not.
Q

Who paid the commission here?
MR. McQUISTON:

The commission here was added to

the invoice price of the cotton and Allenberg paid the full
price of the cotton, including the broker's commission.
Q

You Indicated that sometimes it was either

divided or the farmer paid It.
MR. McQUISTON:

Yes, your Honor.

In some cases

where the farmer invoices his cotton directly to the
merchant himself by attaching his negotiable warehouse
receipts to a draft and forwarding it directly to the
buyer’s bank, he may receive the cash and then have to go
to the broker and pay him his commission.
In this case, the transaction was handled through
the broker’s office and so what the broker did was, he
advanced his own money to the farmer and then attached the
negotiable warehouse receipts to the draft and drew on
Allenberg’s bank In Memphis and that draft included his
commission.
Under this contract that Pittman and Allenberg

8
made, Pittman was obligated to follow the normal industry
practice of warehousing his cotton after it was harvested.
Q

Mr. McQuiston, before you get to the harvest

point, what control did the contract give Allenberg over
Pittman's course of cotton cultivation?
MR. McQUISTON:

The contract specifies that he

would follow normal good farming methods.

It is a contrac­

tual promise that if he didn’t live up to, he would be
subject to breach of contract suit.
The only actual control that Allenberg had over -well, it had no control over his farming methods except
insofar as he was obligated to use normal good farming
methods.

As to ginning process, some farmers, from time to

time, have taken wet cotton and ginned it at a too high a
temperature and ruined the cotton and so the contract
specifies that the buyer will have the option to control
the ginning temperatures.
Q

Would Allenberg, either by contract

or by

Mississippi law, have a lien at any point on Pittman's land
or on the cotton?
MR. HcQUISTON:

On the growing crop?

No, your

Honor.
Q

When was the contract made?
MR. McQUISTON:

The contract was made in January

before Pittman ever planted a single seed.

9
Q

And what is the cotton season in that part of

Mississippi?
MR. McQUISTON:

The planting was in the spring,

April.
Q

April.
MR. McQUISTON:

And then the harvest would be

September or October, anywhere from — it begins at that
point depending on the weather and ends as late as March —
I mean, I'm sorry, as late as December, January.

If the

weather Is wet, last year we didn't get cotton out of the
fields until March.
Q

And the contract was for what?

So many bales

or the entire product?
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Whatever was produced on the 700 acres.
MR. McQUISTON:

Q

It was on the 700 acres of land.

Whatever was produced.

At so much a bale.
MR. McQUISTON:

Was that it?

At so much, depending on the

quality of the cotton, at so much a bale.
Q

There are several grades, are there not?
MR. McQUISTON:

There are several grades.

Now,

the — when the — after the cotton is put in the warehouse,
a sample is cut from the cotton and sent to the Department
of Agriculture.

The U. S. Department of Agriculture

grades the cotton and since they are independent, that is

10
used to determine how much the farmer is paid for his
cotton.
Another sample is

cut from the cotton and is

mailed by the farmer to Memphis and once the cotton merchant
has the sample in Memphis and the negotiable warehouse
receipt, he uses those samples to make up shipping lots.
Now, the ultimate consumer of cotton is cotton
mills and they use it in, traditionally, 100-bale lots.
Each bale in a 100-bale lot has to match the other
in grade, staple and color.

99 bales

Otherwise, it is just not

usable.
Now, the cotton does not come out of the field in
100-bale even-running lots.

One of the primary functions

that the merchant performs is grouping the cotton together
into even-running lots,
Q

You speak of the merchant now who —?
MR. McQUISTON:

The cotton merchant in Memphis,

Allenberg.
Q

Yes.
MR. McQUISTON:

It receives the samples and it

uses them to make up 100-bale shipping lots of even-running
cotton, cotton that is all the same.

And at that point, and

not before then, is anybody in the industry able to deter­
mine where that cotton is to be going.
It can’t be taken from the fields and put on a

11
railroad car.

It has to go Into the warehouse.

A sample

has to be cut, grouped with other like bales and then
shipping order is issued.
The shipping orders are issued from Memphis and
they are long lists of the bales by number.

Each bale is

treated individually and the warehouseman takes the list
and mechanically pulls the bales out and puts them on a
railroad car bound for North Carolina or the Port of New
Orleans or wherever.
The point of that is that the cotton cannot move
out of the State of Mississippi until it has been ware­
housed and classified in the manner that Allenberg does
in this case.
Now, under existing law, the activities that
Allenberg performed in this case in making this contract
as a commodities merchant are recognized as essential and
integral parts of the national commodities merchandising
system and of interstate commerce.
The Commodities Exchange Act, 7 USC Section 3,
states that, "A transaction in respect to cotton shall be
considered to be an interstate commerce if the transaction
is a part of the current of commerce usual in the commodities
trade, including all cases where the purchase is for
shipment out of the state."
The Commodities Exchange Act follows the

12
definition of commerce, interstate commerce, which was
established in the leading agricultural marketing cases of
Dahnke-Walker Hilling Company, Shafer versus Farmers Grain,
Lemke versus Farmers Grain.,
This case that is before the Court today is
stronger than those cases.
Supreme Court

In Shafer and Lemke, the

held that purchases to buy wheat were made

in interstate commerce and not subject to local licensing
and qualification requirements, even though the buyers in
those cases were located in the state, had employees in the
state, offices in the state, paid for the wheat in the
state, received delivery of the wheat in the state and even
owned local grain elevators in the state.
And in the Dahnke case, the contract between the
selling farmer and the wheat purchaser in that case was
held to be in interstate commerce, even

though the farmer

did not know he was making a contract with an out-of-state
company.
And in here, Mr. Pittman knew from the beginning
that he was making a contract with the Allenberg Cotton
Company, a Tennessee corporation.
Q

In Dahnke, the sale was FOB, wasn't it?
MR. McQUISTION:

The sale was FOB cars in Dahnke.

But the sale in the Shafer and Lemke cases was delivery at
the grain elevators, which serve the same function in the

13
wheat industry that the cotton warehouses do in our
industry.
Allenberg’s purchase *— well, the facts of this
case are also stronger than these wheat cases because in
the wheat cases, they said that

approximately 90 percent

of the wheat left the State of South Dakota.

Ten percent

was used locally.
In Mississippi, every bale of cotton, or virtually
every bale that is produced in the state is shipped from
the state.

There is just no significant amount of milling

in the State of Mississippi.
Cotton Is one of the nation’s most important
exports.

In 1973 there were 7 million bales of cotton

exported by companies just like my client out of a total
U. S. cotton crop of 12 million bales.

That 12 million

bales, In 1973 — of that 12 million bales, 1.8 million
bales were raised in Mississippi alone and in 1973s at the
time this decision was rendered by the Supreme Court of
Mississippi, 1 million bales of cotton in the State of
Mississippi were under forward contracts identical to the
one put forward in this case.
For this reason, the decision of the Mississippi
Supreme Court In this case hit our industry like a bombshell.
In 1973s the United States Department of Agriculture had
mounted an intensive campaign to convince everybody in the

14
cotton industry to enter into forward contracts.

That is,

contracts that are made in the early part of the year before
the farmer produces

or plants his cotton.

This campaign was so successful in 1973 that
three out of every four bales of cotton raised in the
country were subject to contract like this one in this case.
The decision in this case which held in the
middle of the year that a foreign cotton buyer could not
enforce its contract in a Mississippi court literally
threatened to ruin our entire Industry.

If this decision

had stood, in just Mississippi alone — which it did not,
thanks to the intervention of the Federal District Courts
there — a large part of our industry would have been
destroyed and I believe the entire nation would have
suffered.
Q

Why iTOuld you not have gone ahead and qualified

if the Supreme Court of Mississippi decision had stood?
MR. McQUISTON:

We did qualify immediately there­

after, but under the decision below, subsequent qualifi­
cation does not cure the defect.

You can never sue on a

contract made in Mississippi -Q

But your contract — I would think you could sue

on contracts made after your qualification.
MR. McQUISTON:

Yes, we could, but these in 1973

were made before this decision was announced.

15
Q

But I mean, as to the future, I don’t see why it

would have any great impact.

Your contracts are annual

ones, aren't they?
MR. McQUISTON:

Well, it has an impact in this

manner, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Under present Mississippi

law, with this no-cure statute, there is a market barrier
raised around the borders of the state.

A cotton company

that is not qualified to do business in the State of
Mississippi cannot now even submit a bid to buy cotton
there.
Q

But you have qualified.
MR. McQUISTON:

We have, yes.

And companies

that are large companies, of course, will qualify and
establish themselves in the markets.

But there won't be

the free competition — a farmer in Mr. Pittman's position
today can't pick up the phone and shop his cotton with any
cotton merchant in the country.

He is limited to those who

have previously qualified to do business in Mississippi.
Q

Well, the burden of qualifying is not great,

is it?
MR. McQUISTION:

The burden is -— these are small

companies, Mr. Justice White, and there are 500 to 1,000
of them and the administrative costs in our Industry are
very significant factor in determining what areas of
competition we operate in.

The central tools of a cotton

a

16
merchant are a desk and a telephone and a good bankline of
credit and we —
Q

And not a lawyer?
MR. McQUISTON:

I mean —

And not a lawyer.

No, I wouldn’t

say that because the Allenberg Cotton Company, as a matter
of fact, is headed by a Yale lawyer.

These companies

are not -Q

A free trader.
MR. McQUISTON:

the decisions of this

A free trader, absolutely, under

Court in the Dahnke-Walker case and

Lemke and Shafer.
These administrative costs, I know — after this
decision, vre had to qualify Allenberg in every state.
Q

I wondered if what you really worried about was,

not just a qualification but other burdens that this might
portend that might threaten, like taxation.
MR. McQUISTON:
all.

As a matter of

We are not worried about it at

fact, I’d be happy to pay, well,

whatever Mississippi taxes were due because there are none
due.
Q

Yes, but what if Mississippi decided to tax,

put an excise tax on cotton stored in Mississippi,
warehoused in Mississippi?
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Even if it is owned by Allenberg.
That would be all right with us.

You think they have jurisdiction to do it?

17
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Yes.

So you think the tax cases and the qualification

cases aren't really —MR. McQUISTON:

They have to be separated and

they always have been, for this reason.
Q

I suppose the economic basis for your response

is that Mississippi must remain competitive with the other
states on the cotton market?
MR. McQUISTON:

Yes, sir.

We are supposedly a

common market in this country and —
Q

And you don't think storing cotton in the state

is an intrastate business?
MR. McQUISTON:
your Honor.
Q

We don't store the cotton there,

The farmer —

Well, when you take title to it, it is in a

warehouse in Mississippi.
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

That is exactly right.

And you get the warehouse receipts.

And are you

saying there is no substantial period of time that elapses
between giving the warehouse receipts to you and the ship­
ment out of the state?
MR. McQUISTON:

Not in relation to the industry

practice.
Q

How long is the cotton stored in Mississippi?
MR. McQUISTON:

The cotton crop begins to come in

18
in September and October and as soon as those receipts are
begun to be received by the cotton merchant, it is moved out.
If the —
Q

What is the average length of time?

average length of time the cotton is
MR. McQUISTON:

What is the

stored?

There is nothing in the record

indicating that.
Q

Well, for all we know, then, the cotton is stored

there In your name for quite awhile.
MR. McQUISTON:

Well, for all you know, I might

reply, the cotton moves immediately.
Q

Well, I know, but what do we do, invalidate a

state statute on some assumption like that?
MR- McQUISTON:

Well, I don't think this case

turns on how long the cotton stays there.
Q

Well, that is what I really want to get to.

So

your answer to my question awhile ago is, it wouldn’t make
any difference if you stored, warehoused cotton in Mississippi
for a long time?
MR. McQUISTON:

No, it would not, your Honor.

Because the purchase contract, the making of the purchase
contract is the protected activity here.

It is entering

into this contract —
Q

You mean, even though It was contemplated that

Allenberg ttfould not take the cotton out of the state for a

19
long time?

But only when Its futures contracts matured?
Even if you were planning MR. McQUISTON:

Even if you made that assumption,

I would say that this contract was in interstate commerce
when it was —
Q

Well, what if you are wrong on that?
How about this case?
MR. McQUISTON:

In this case, the cotton was

never delivered, so there is no evidence in the record as
to how long it would have stayed.

Now, the Industry prac­

tice is that —
Q

Well, who gets the benefit of that not knowing,

the state or you?
MR. McQUISTON:

I believe that we would.

We know,

from the industry practice that is described in this
record, that the cotton moves out of the state all during
the succeeding weeks after it Is harvested.

It moves out

just like the wheat crop did in the Shafer case and Lemke
case.
Q

Well, in those cases, when the farmers saw that

It was put on a common carrier headed out of the state.
MR. McQUISTON:

No, the farmer sold the wheat

in Shafer and Lemke to a grain elevator operator who stored
It there and then when he made a carload lot —Q

I see, yes.
MR. McQUISTON:

-- and shipped it out afterwards.

20
In 1973, the price of cottons by unhappy
coincidence, rose to the highest levels since the Civil
War and at the very same time the decision in this case
below was announced, which cut across all the existing
contracts in our industry and literally faced our industry
with bankruptcy.

Disaster was avoided because of the

honesty of most cotton farmers in the south and also
because of the decisive action of the Federal District
Court in Mississippi and Alabama which held, in the middle
of the delivery season, that these contracts were made in
interstate commerce and they maintain the free flow of
cotton out of those

states under court order and under

injunction.
Despite the fact that this case is typical of the
industry practice and despite the fact that the DahnkeWalker Milling Company case rejects the title "passage
analysis," Pittman seises on one aspect of this case and
builds his entire argument around it and that is the fact
that title

passes to Allenberg and for a short period of

time, as Mr. Justice White pointed out, we have title to
cotton which is located In a compress and warehouse.
Q

And which you think might be subject to local

taxation.
MR. McQUISTON:
open question.

Which I — I think that is an

I think if this Court gets into deciding

21
qualification cases on the basis of whether or not the
goods are taxable, you have really opened up a Pandora’s
Box.
Q

Or in accordance

with whether it might be subject

to service or process in the state.
MR. McQUISTON:

Yes, sir.

That, too.

Cotton, as I have tried to point out, is not
fungible and the warehousing step is absolutely essential
in buying cotton in the State of Mississippi and shipping it
from the state.
Cotton cannot leave the State of Mississippi
until it has gone through this process.

This case raises

the question that was posed in the Robbins versus Shelby
County Taxing District case and that is, if the commerce
clause guarantees a buyer of cotton access to the Mississippi
market to make its contracts to buy cotton and remove it
from the state, then how is the Allenberg Cotton Company
to go into the Mississippi market and buy cotton and move
it out of the state without qualifying to do business?
Another answer to this argument of Appellee is
that it proves too much.

The Appellee’s argument would

mean that cotton buyers and buyers of wheat and other
farm products that are stored for which negotiable ware­
house receipts are now freely transferable could not just
buy or make a contract to buy any negotiable warehouse

22
receipt in the country.

They would now have to look behind

the receipt to determine whether they xtfere qualified to do
business in the state where the goods were stored, : hich
would mean that negotiable warehouse receipts would no
longer be freely negotiable.
Under the decision below, a very substantial
trade barrier has been erected around the State of
Mississippi.

No buyer who is not qualified to do business

in the State of Mississippi could now submit a bid to buy
cotton there because if he submitted a bid and made a
contract, a one-way contract would be created, which could
be enforced against the buyer but yet the farmer's option —
but the buyer could not enforce it against the farmer.
Q

What is Involved in registering to do business in

Mississippi?
MR. McQUISTON:

Piling a number of informational

papers about the corporation's activities and the basic
corporate information and some fees and renewing that each
year.
Q

It is annually renewed?
MR. McQUISTON:

It is annually renewed and this

is the thing that gets to be such a burden.

For example,

when we qualified Allenberg after the decision in this case,
in the 17 different states where it shops for cotton, it
took us about two months and we had to employ an accountant—

23
it didn't take us two months working every day, but I mean,
the period spread out over that long a time and we had
the CT Corporation sending us forms and we had to get an
accountant coming in and fill out the forms for us and we
have got to do that

every year.

Now, as the result, as a practical matter,
Allenberg is just going to quit doing business in a couple
of states where it has a very minor interest because it is
just administratively too expensive to compete in those
states if it has to qualify.
Q

Is the annual qualification

fee

in Mississippi

a flat fee, or is it graduated in accordance with business
or capital stock?
MR. McQUISTON:

I am not sure, Mr. Justice Powell.

I'm sorry, I can't answer that.
Of course, in the various states, there are
graded fees.
Q

Yes.
MR. McQUISTON:

And, ofcourse,

we are talking

here, not just about qualifying in Mississippi but in
every state in the country, in other industries that have
to qualify, that would have to qualify if this decision
were made the law of the land, we'd have every variation
in the 50 states.
Q

This same technique of doing business obtains in

24
all 17 of these states with forward contracts and ware­
housing in the states?
MR. McQUISTON:

Yess your Honor.

It is identical

for the entire industry,
Q

Not every state, however -MR. McQUISTON:

Not every state has this "no-cure”

statute.
Q

Has this "no cure of sanction."
MR. McQUISTON:

"No cure of sanction" is what has

got our industry on the edge because what has happened is ,
when these contracts xvere made in 1973, they were immediately
hedged by offsetting sales in the New York Cotton Exchange.
Those hedges are maintained with margin accounts on the
New York Cotton Exchange that are bank-financed.
Everything in this industry is financed on about
a 90 percent basis.

Now, the whole principle of the

national agricultural marketing system is that the hedge
will be valid,

tne sale on the

Cotton Exchange and the

purchase in the field from the farmer.

And the Mississippi

Supreme Court all of a sudden told us the purchase contracts
were no longer valid and we are looking a huge losses on
the New York Cotton Exchange, losses that would have
destroyed the industry, a large part of it, and caused
substantial losses to the banks that financed these
purchases and —

25
Q

Excuse me, I just am a little untutored and

unsophisticated in this business.

I am curious.

Maybe I

won’t be able to understand it at all, even after you
explain it.

But as soon as Allenberg signed this contract

to purchase cotton from Pittman —■
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Yes.

™ and did so in January, long before any seed

had even been planted, it made an offsetting sale on the
New York Cotton Exchange.
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Of what?

Yes, sir.

What did it sell?

MR. McQUISTON:

Cotton futures?

Cotton futures to be delivered

in October or December of the following year, when it
expected the —
Q

Of the same year, right?
MR. McQUISTON:

Q

And of the same amount of cotton?
MR. McQUISTON:

Q

Of the sarnie year.

Yes, sir.

Or what, a certain number of bales of cotton, I

guess?
MR. McQUISTON:

The contracts on the New York

Cotton Exchange are in 100-bale lots.

So Allenberg made

this contract and others in Mississippi, decided about how
much cotton it estimated it had bought —
Q

Estimated the yield.

26
MR. McQUISTON:

It made an estimated sale on the

New York Cotton Exchange at the
Q

identical same time.

And at what price, compared to the price --

compared to the agreed purchase price?
MR. McQUISTON:
a 400-'point spread.

There is usually about what we call

A point is a penny, so about a $4 or

$5 spread between the price that — and that spread covers
the expected cost of borrowing the money to maintain the
hedge for the year, shipping the cotton, paying the railroad
freight and so on to get it to a point of delivery the
following year when it is delivered.
So if vie bought cotton in 1973 at 30 cents a
pound, the hedge would be at 34 or 35 cent a pound.
)

Q

You'd sell

it.

MR. McQUISTON:
Q

You'd sell

Yes, 3ir.

the futures for 34 cents.

MR. McQUISTON: ' For
Q

34 or 35cents

a pound.

34 or 35.
MR. McQUISTON:

And, of course, if the price of

cotton went up, as it did in 1973, to almost $1 a pound
for the first time since the Civil War,, we are looking at
losses that far exceeded the capital of the entire
industry.
Q

And then when the cotton — let's ■— I just want

to know about industry practice, not about this case.

27
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Yes, sir.

When the cotton was delivered by Mr. Pittman or

somebody else to the warehouse, he gins it, he does the
ginning?
MR. McQUISTON:

He takes it to the local gin.

That is all his business.

He gins it.

Then he brings it

to a —
Q

A warehouse.
MR. McQUISTON:

A compress and warehouse company.

The compress takes the loose cotton \\rhich

he delivers to

them, which is not shippable because It is all so loose,
and compresses it into a bale and cuts the sample from the
bale.
Q

And you told us about cutting the samples,

sending one

to

the

Department

one to your client and your

of Agriculture and another
client has the job of having

running — what is it called?
MR. McQUISTON:
Q

Making even-running lots.
MR. McQUISTON:

Q

Making even-running lots.

Out of these hundreds of bales.

Hundred-bale lots.

And then what happens when

the time comes due or the New York Cotton Exchange?
MR. McQUISTTN:

The hedge is taken out by an

offsetting contraption and If the market has gone up, there
is a loss account on the New York Cotton Exchange.

And if

28
the market has gone down* there is a gain in the New York
Cotton Exchange which* hopefully, offsets the loss on the
purchase with the farmer.
Q

And you say the way to go into this business is

with a desk and a telephone and a banker who will extend
you credit?
MR. McQUISTON:

Well, this is true not only in

the cotton industry, but wheat, soybeans —
Q

A lot of businesses.
MR. McQUISTON:

The commodities merchandising

Industry works exactly like the cotton industry does.
Q

Mr. McQuiston, before you sit down, let me ask a

question or two about tactics.

This case strikes me as a

very precisely-issued case, fairly simple, and our Rule of
40 reads, "That there shall be in the brief a concise
statement of the case containing all that is material to
the consideration of the questions presented."
Looking at your brief, there are some 30 pages in
the statement of the case.

Do you think that complies with

our rule?
MR. MCQUISTON:

Your Honor, we felt that there was

no way for this Court, to consider thl s case without con­
sidering the industry context and the 30 pages that you
refer to are pages drawn from well-established cotton
industry textbooks to guJ.de the Court in seeing the context

29
of this particular contract — and from Department of
Agriculture publications.
Q

There are some members of the Court that think we

have enough to do.

You have a 106-page brief and the 44-

page reply brief and your friend, Professor Blumstein, has
a 100-page brief.

That makes 250 pages on a single issue.

I wonder whether the temptation is not to have
your brief forego reading when it is at that great length.
MR. McQUISTON:

Well, I hope that has not

happened, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and I apologize for
burdening the Court with the extra pages.
The case is so important to our industry that,
perhaps, we are overdoing it, but we didn't want to leave
any stone unturned.
We are fighting for our lives.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cochran.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE C. COCHRAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. COCHRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The reply brief referred to in part of the
presentation here gives rise to at least one issue which is
nonconstitutional but I think it has to be covered,
especially in light of the reliance placed by Appellant on

30

the Curt. Flood case [Flood v. Kuhn].

The argument Is that

this company has relied upon this Court's precedent.
Pahnke-Walker, Shafer and whatnot.
If you’ll turn to page 92 of the record in this
case, the secretary-treasuer of the corporation was asked
if they had sought advice of counsel as to whether or not
they should qualify and the answer was no and the reliance
by this company on this Court's precedent is again pointed
to by the fact that the Pahnke-Walker case wasn't spotted
until a petition for rehearing was filed after the
Mississippi Supreme Court decided against Allenberg Cotton
Company.
’Which brings up the question on jurisdiction.

You

have a Pecember the 17th certificate outstanding right now
requesting that a full certificate be secured from the
Mississippi Supreme Court that a federal question was raised.
Inadequate state ground doesn't exist.
there.

The certificate is

They have not taken any steps to comply with the

Pecember 17th order.
Q

Wasn't the certificate signed by the chief justice?
MR. COCHRAN:

0.

Yes, sir, it was.

Poesn't that comply?
MR, COCHRAN:

Not under Alderson, footnote four

in Alderson indicates that a single judge certificate is
not sufficient and your order — sir?

31
Q

Did Alderson refer to a state supreme court?

I’ve forgotten.
MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, sir,it did.

And footnote four in Alderson, which this Court
cites, on December the 17th and sends back to the
Mississippi Supreme Court for a full court certificate.
Q

And that was our order of December 17th last?
MR. COCHRAN:

Q

December 17th.

And it was never complied with?
MR. COCHRAN:

It was never complied with so I —

this jurisdictional problem is lurking there and my position
is that until that December 17th order is complied with,
that is, getting a certificate for the Mississippi Supreme
Court, this Court lacks jurisdiction.
But there is a serious jurisdictional problem,
Q

When did we note that?
MR. COCHRAN:

Two and a half months later, you

noted probable jurisdiction, pending a determination of
whether or not there ivas —
Q

But there was a response of some kind from counsel,

wasn’t there?
MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, a filing was made reprinting

the opinion of the United States District Court case,
Cone Mills and then after that case arrived here, probable
jurisdiction was noted.

32
How, Dahnke-Walker is the major case relied upon
by opposing counsel.

Well, Dahnke -VI a Ike r was a case where

delivery was made on board a railroad car.

Here we have

delivery to warehouses with the record showing the warehouses
served as

cotton concentration points, with cotton, at

least 25,000 bales by this company being stored in
Mississippi for an indeterminate period.
The fact situation is running on all fours with
Coe versus Town of Errol and the decision last term in
Cocidar.
There are two cases,

Chassinol and Federal

Compress, relating to the type of business that Allenberg
is engaged in, one, allowing taxes on the warehousing
business and the other, a license tax for buyers of cotton,
which Allenberg Cotton Company is.
The last decision by this Court, the Eli Lilly
case, uses taxing cases for determination of whether or not
qualification is necessary.

The analogy follows that if a

company is engaged in taxable activities, then it can be
required to qualify.
Are there any questions?
Q

Do you make any distinction between engaging in

taxable activities and a tax levied on the property itself?
MR. COCHRAN:
being levied?

Are you talking about actual tax

33
Q

Yes.
MR. COCHRAN:

Q

Or

apotential

tax?

Either.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, with respect to Allenberg,

there are cases showing that an ad veloram property tax
can be applied as well as a tax for engaging in the business,
your license tax.
Q

Which kind of a tax were
MR. COCHRAN:

have to be licensing.

you talking about?

Well, under Eli Lilly, it would
Eli Lilly breaks the point at

licensing because then you get into —
Q

So an ad veloram tax, then, would not create that

problem, then.

Is that your position?

MR. COCHRAN:
Q

No, sir.

No.

Well, what about Shafer and Lemke?
MR. COCHRAN:

begin with.

Shafer and Lemke, well, Shafer, to

You have language in that opinion that buying

for interstate shipment is interstate commerce and that is
the case relied upon by Appellants.
The case has been distinguished and distinguished
since it was handed down and x^ritten by Mr. Justice Vandenberg.

To me, it is a preemption case, Shafer

it would be a preemption case.

is.

Today

Shafer has not been followed

by this Court.
Chassinol, involving cotton-buying —

34
Q

Well, Lemlce wasn't a preemption case.
MR. COCHRAN:

Q

No, no, your Honor, it wasn't.

No trace of it.
MR. COCHRAN:

All right.

But in Shafer, now,

Shafe_r, itfhen this Court came down with the decision in
Chassinol relating to whether or not you can license
cotton buying, petition for rehearing was filed on the basis
of Shafer.
Shafer was distinguished away in Parker versus
Brown purely on the basis that immediate shipment was
involved in Shafer while in this case vie don't have
immediate shipment.
Q
shipment?

Are you relying on that here, that no immediate
Let's assume that —
MR. COCHRAN:

No, I'm pointing -- the record says

that —Q

Let's assume Allenberg — let's assume Allenberg

took delivery from the farmer by way of an interstate
courier.
MR. COCHRAN:
Q

That would do it.

That would do what?
MR. COCHRAN:

They would not have to qualify.

They would be interstate commerce.
Q

So you say it is just their way of taking

delivery at the warehouse and then having it loaded on a

35
carrier at the warehouse that makes a difference?
MR. COCHRAN:

That was the Coe versus Town of

Errol.
Q

So you think it does make the difference?
MR. COCHRAN:

Sure.

Well, the Cocidar opinion

points out the mechanical test is the test which this
Court feels is determinative and here we have a delay prior
to transit.
Q

Of course, the export clause doesn’t necessarily

follow the same guidelines as the interstate commerce.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, you have got Richfield Oil

and the County of Merced case that both indicate the same
test will be used for import-export and commerce clause
definition in the Coe versus Errol situation.
Of course, Coe versus Errol was interstate
commerce and import-export.
Q

Well, I \tfould think you would argue also that

Allenberg has an agent in the state that is —
MR. COCHRAN:
Q

I don’t —

— that is supervising

the execution of its

contract.
MR. COCHRAN:

The — having an agent in the

state may not be a critical fact.

The record is replete

with evidence that Mr. Covington, who is doing the buying,
was acting on a commission basis for Allenberg.

But having

36
an agent, to me, is not as critical as the fact that this
company owns cotton —
Q

Located in Mississippi.
MR. COCHRAN:

Located in Mississippit and stored

there.
Q

And not on its way yet.
MR. COCHRAN:

They are just like a local company.

There is no difference between Allenberg Cotton Company —
Q

Lemke and Shafer say that that stoppage in transit

is still part of interstate commerce.
MR. COCHRAN:

That would stand alone.

And you

can’t reconcile Lemke and Shafer with Coe versus Errol or
this Court’s decision last term in Cocidar.
Q

Well, that is under another clause.

Q

Well, do you think the time lag in Cocidar has

any implications with reference to this?
MR. COCHRAN:

Reference — the opinion is written

in such a way that the time lag is not critically important.
The County of Merced case, where you have got this concrete
factory being undone, the breaking —■ there wasn’t time —
some had already been shipped there but it was just the fact
that the goods were at rest, prior to insertion into foreign
commerce like prior to insertion into interstate commerce
here, once that delay is there, then the full power of the
state to regulate tax comes into play and that is what we

37

have here.
Q

As my brother Relinquish indicated a moment ago,

the export-import clause is not the interstate commerce
clause.

It is a separate clause of the Constitution.

It

has a separate gloss on it by the decided cases of this
Court.
As I remember in Cocidar, no cases were cited or
relied on that didn't --MR. COCHRAN:
Q

Involving interstate commerce.

Involving the commerce clause.
MR. COCHRAN:

But Richfield Oil says the same test

will be applied, Mr. Justice Douglas.
When you have the schematic situation in this
sense, where goods are sitting and prior to insertion in
the same test.
Q

Well, what do you have to say about the impact

of the Supreme Court — the Mississippi Supreme Court' s
decision?
MR. COCIIRAN:

There is nothing in the record.

There is nothing in the record.
Q

Well, what are the realities of which we might

take judicial notice?
What do you think the realities are?
MR. COCHRAN:
Q

The realities of the industry?

Yes, on interstate commerce.

38

MR. COCHRAN:
Q

Well, the reality —

Is it consistent with the history of the coirmierce

clause itself?
MR. COCHRAN:

To penalize companies who do not

qulaify by not giving them access to court systems?
Q

Yes.
MR. COCIIRAN:

here.

We don't have interstate commerce

It is intrastate.
Q

Oh, I

see.

MR. COCHRAN:
Q

These are all activities —

Well, if you start with that premise, of course,

I would —
MR. COCIIRAN:
Q

I'd have to

You'd go down the garden path.
take your conclusion.

MR. COCHRAN:

Oh, but this is intrastate commerce.

This is a contract between a Mississippi farmer for delivery
to a Mississippi warehouse, activities before interstate
commerce begins.
events.

It is a purely intrastate sequence of

It can be regulated and taxed by the state,

obviously.
Q

On your theory, then, the only way to escape this

situation would be to get those bales and —
MR. COCHRAN:
Q

Put them on tie railroad.

— put them on a railroad car.

they be there, 24 hours?

How long could

39

MR. COCHRAN;
Q

No, no.

On the railraod cars?

The railroad cars aren’t always available

right away.
MR. COCHRAN:
Q

Oh.

Sometimes you have

got to put them on a loading

platform.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, then you have got cases

which I have cited in my brief.

If they aren't loaded

directly on the car, then there is going to be problems.
It is going to be taxable and it is going to be intrastate
commerce.
Q

On a shipping platform?
MR. COCHRAN:

I would say it would have to go

directly to the railroad carrier, with no storage facility
between the time that it leaves the field to the time it
is placed on the interstate carrier.
Q

But it would have to go on a truck or

some

vehicle from the field right alongside the tracks and then
be put on the cars.
MR. COCHRAN:

Yes.

Yes, I'd take it.

I'd put

it on a common carrier, say a truck from the field and
deliver it to another common carrier and then it is a
straight-through schematic and you are out of the Coe
versus Errol problem, not taxable.

It cannot be regulated

by the state and is purely interstate commerce.
Q

What if the carrier doesn't have the cars

40

and holds it for a week?
Q

What does that do to it?

Well, you can parallel that situation with the

situation where you have goods in interstate transit and
there is a stop and the continuity of transit test is that
for business purpose — and in Coe versus Errol, again, you
have got the logs that were placed, that were there because
the water was down, not taxable.
So taking Coe versus Errol to your analysis, if
it is just because it is not enough trucks or something,
Coe versus Errol, not taxable.
Q

I am not giving you an analysis.

I am just asking

a question.
MR. COCHRAN:

That is the only analysis.

I could

parallel your facts situation.
Q

Well, of course, you could make provisions from

any of the hypotheses that the Chief Justice has proposed
to you by simply providing that the title passes or risk of
loss passes FOB the railroad car.

I mean, the cotton, this

particular cotton, has been in the State of Mississippi for
months.

It is just a question of when Allenberg takes title

to it, isn't it?
MR. COCHRAN:

They take title immediately upon

placement in the warehouse, right at that point.
Q

Well, I think when the warehouse certificates are

delivered to them.

41

MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, the farmer has to get those

certificates and —
Q

Well, he gets them and gives them to Allenberg,

I take it„
MR. COCHRAN:

But then, I am into a part of the

case I -- I, along with Mr. Justice Stewart, I am not
exactly sure what happens after the purchase is made.
There is nothing in the record.
Q

I think that then the bill of lading goes to the

bank in Memphis for collection.
MR. COCHRAN:

There is nothing in the record on

that.
Q

Warehouse receipt, I meant to say.

Q

Mr. Cochran?
MR. COCHRAN:

Q

In your view,

Yes.
what state interest is served by

having a no-cure sanction for failure to qualify?
MR. COCHRAN:
Q

What state interest?

Yes.
MR. COCHRAN:

It is a brutal penalty, but it

provides immediate leverage to companies to ensure that
they will qualify and there is a high state interest in
qualification.
Q

Right.
MR. COCHRAN:

You can parallel the no-cure thing

42

as to 60 years for smoking marijuana.

Does the penalty have

anything to do with the malfeasance at issue.

It is a

strong penalty but there is no constitutional issue raised.
Q

But here one private party, in effect, achieves

a windfall and the other party, a very severe penalty.

It

is hard for me to see precisely what the state interest is.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, the state interest is, they are

qualified now.
Q

Yes, but that could be achieved, couldn't it, with

somewhat less penalty or allowing qualification and the
payment of fees before suit could be brought?
MR. COCHRAN:

Politically — but it is not

The only point raised

was that this interstate commerce —

Plus it

It wasn't argued.

And in the

petition for rehearing it wasn't mentioned.

Nov; it is

mentioned in the reply brief, for the first time.
Q

Mr. Cochrvn?
MR. COCHRAN:

Q

Yes.

In a sittation like this, it is kind of like a

one-bite type of thing, isn't it?

The company can go along

without qualifying for years until finally it has to bring a

43
suit and then it can qualify so that it really never has
to qualify for practical purposes until it is actually
involved in litigation.
Q

If you have a retroactive penalty, what happens —

say that there is a cure provision, that you can sue on
antecedent debts.

Well, then, what you do is you negotiate

with the defendant and say, look, I — no, the defendant
can't raise the defense because as soon as the company
complies, the defense is lost so the state interest in
requiring qualification is out the window but without the
type of provision Mississippi has.

So It is a powerful

weapon and it has been used here and — but still, there is
nothing in the record as to what the industry situation is
with respect to cotton brokers.
This is Just part of the ongoing war.

When the

price of cotton goes down, other things occur.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

I think you have used all your time,
Mr. MeQuiston.
Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:51 o'clock p.m., the case
was submitted.]
