MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in 73-1424, Serfass against the United
States.
Mr. Dower,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY A. DONER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DOWER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At the outset I would like to reserve, if I may,
five minutes of my time for rebuttal.
If I may, sir, I'd like to reserve five minutes of
ray time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Dower.
MR. DOWER;

May it please Your Honors, this matter

appears before the Court, your having granted a petition for
a writ of certiorari on the petition of David Serfass, to
review the record of the Third Circuit which had reversed a
decision of the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania.
Chief Judge Michael Sheridan had granted an order
dismissing the indictment, the motion having been filed on
behalf of Mr. Serfass.

He had been indicted for refusing to

submit to induction under the Selective Service Act.
David Serfass was in the Peace Corps in Panape,

4
a remote island in the Pacific, and he had completed his
two years of duty there and was requested by the Panape
Transportation Authority to serve several months longer to
complete the training of a native as a maintenance superin­
tendent .
There was some raixup in his notifying his Draft
3oard that his term in the Peace Corps had been concluded,
Ha did receive a notice to report for induction; there was
again another raixup, but he did make it to Allentown, his
residence, at 2;00 a.m. on -the day that he was to repdrt for
transportation at 5:00 a.m.
He went to the induction center in Wilkes-Barre,
and was found to be suffering from amoebic dysentery, and was
returned, to report at a later date.
It was at that interval, for the first time, that
he spoke to the pastor of his church and learned -— and in
his discussions with his pastor, he began to have very
serious reservations about serving in the military service.
He then, upon advice, applied for Form 150 from the
Selective Service Administration, which is the form to be
used for an application for classification as a conscientious
objector.
The draft board perfunctorily denied his application
and just stated to him that there was no change in classifica­
tion, over which he had no control, and again ordered him to

report, for induction.

This time he again went to the

induction center# and# the usual procedure in cases of this kind#
at the last minute refused to take the oath and to submit to
induction.
About twenty months later# he was indicted and
arrested and a trial date was set for a speedy trial.
that time we filed two motions:

At

one# a motion to dismiss

the indictment? and also a concurrent or simultaneous motion
to postpone the trial.
Judge Sheridan did grant the -- ordered the post­
ponement of the trial# set a date for oral argument of the
motion to dismiss, and at that argument the United States
Attorney did stipulate that the application for conscientious
objector classification# which David Serfass had made# did
meet the prima facie requirements.
Following this and within a short time after the
oral argument# Judge Sheridan requested, and this was agreed
by both parties, that is # by David Serfass and by the United
States'# that his entire Selective Service file be submitted
to Judge Sheridan. And this was done.
Some months later# Judge Sheridan# pursuant to a
line of cases in the Third Circuit# did grant the motion#
did order the dismissal of the indictment.
The government appealed# and we moved to dismiss
in the Third Circuit on the ground of lack of jurisdiction#

6
and that matter, as well as trie argument on the merits, were
briefed simultaneously.
The Third Circuit at that time had adopted a
procedure whereby it, on its own order, would dispense with
oral argument, and it was done in this case»
It, of course, has oral arguments, but in this case
there was no oral argument.
Now, the time interval here was interesting.

This

Court, in its decision in Shiert, had indicated that -there is
a no-man's-land between the Draft Board having considered a
request, on the merits, for conscientious objector classifica­
tion after a notice of induction had been received, and the
same kind — rather, a consideration of this issue within the
military service; that the Court may very well consider that
to be a situation different from Ehlert.
The Musser case, which was decided last summer in a
per curiam opinion, I think only one dissent, Justice 'Douglas
dissented, in a sense clarified, at least for -the Third
Circuit, the holding in Khlsrb? and under Musser it was held
that the draft beards had no power to consider a request for
conscientious objector classification after a notice of
induction had been sent.
As a consequence, the Third Circuit reversed on the
merits., and also denied the motion to dismiss for lack of
jurisdigtion

QUESTION:
Mr. Dower:

Let me bade up a little bit, if I may,

In the hearing on your motion before Judge

Sheridan, could he have made a finding, a determination of
guilt?
MR. DOWER:

Yes, sir — I'm sorry, not a finding

of guilt: he could have mad®
QUESTION:

A determination of guilt.

MR. DOWER:

He could have terminated the case,

which is what he did.
QUESTION: Well, no, but could he have made a
determination that the man was guilty —
MR. DOWER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
— and that there was no necessity of

going on with the trial?
MR. DOWER;

No, sir, he could not have made a

finding of guilty.
The motion to-dismiss was accompanied by an
affidavit relating to several pages from the Selective
Service file.

But no jury trial has ever been waived, there

was no formal motion for acquittal.

It is quite correct, sir,

that we do not argue for a moment that he could have been
found guilty on the motion to dismiss the indictment, not
having been tried.
In the

after the denial, after the reversal of

the District Court order by the Third Circuit, we then

s
petitioned for a writ of certiorari, and I'm quite aware that
there are several others cases to be argued this morning, all
of which come up at the same time, and generally deal with
the 1971 Criminal Appeals Act, which was an amendment to the
Act following this Court's decision in Sisson.
I think perhaps, for me at least, the only -thing
that's clear about the 1971 amendment is that it was a
response to this Court's decision in Sisson.
Now, this Act. is different, and, so far as I know,
these are the first cases to come up under this Act, raising
the question as to what the Act means at least, particularly
in reference to the double jeopardy provision.
New, the Act, I would note, and I think this is
quite important, is not the bill that was introduced in the
Senate, the Act now provides that in a criminal case an
appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals
from an order dismissing an indictment — and the important
words,

at least as far as we're concerned, is "except that

no appeal Shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the
Constitution prohibits it.”
Now, we're back at the point where perhaps we were
in 1907, when the Senate, considering the original Criminal
Appeals Act, had decided, or, rather, debated that they were
going to depend upon this Court to tell the Senate and tell
us what double jeopardy meant. Because, of

all the cases that

9
have been decided, particularly in recent years, and many of
them under the Selective Service Act, there really is no
firm guide for anyone, so far as I can see, to know just what
double jeopardy means in terms of pretrial and, in some cases,
post-trial dismissals of an indictment or of a charge,
whatever it may be called.
Now, Sisson, of course, was a post-trial dismissal?
Serfass is a pretrial dismissal.

The second case you have

today, the Jenkins case, is one which is again a post-trial
dismissal -— I'm sorry, was an acquittal in a trial by a
judge.

And the third case that you have this morning, the

Wilson case, is one in which there was a dismissal of a
charge after a trial.
Now, in Serfass, we argue -that this Act, the 1971
Criminal Appeals Act must have some meaning in order not to
be a truism.

I would dispose of the latter part first by

saying that I cannot conceive how Congress could enact a
Criminal Appeals Act which would authorize the United States
to appeal in violation of the double jeopardy provision.
Congress does have the power to regulate the
jurisdiction of the courts, but I cannot understand — and
I'm very happy -that we don't have to argue, or don't have
that case — that an appeal would lie, which is contrary to
the double jeopardy provision.
So if this escception is to have any meaning, then,

10

this is what I assume these cases are about.
Now, just what is double jeopardy?
Now, I would also point out -that, as I understand
the real burden, the real thrust of the government's brief
in the Serfass case, and to some extent in the others too,
•that what the government is attempting to do is to have
decisions of this Court which in effect would reinstate the
bill as introduced into the Senate, under which an appeal
would have been possible from any pretrial disposition of a
Case, short of an acquittal or a conviction, of course
the government wouldn't be appealing a conviction, 'theoreti­
cally.'
QUESTION?

Would the difference in language in the

bills make much difference, Mr. Dower?

Isn't it clear from

the bill that was enacted that Congress meant to authorise
appeals in all cases, unless appeal would violate the double
jeopardy clause?
MR. DOWER:

I don't think so, sir.

The — when

Congress says that an appeal in a criminal case lies from an
order dismissing an indictment, surely it must contemplate
that there are situations in which a dismissal would have
arisen ~~ would have brought about ■— I'm sorry? that prior
"to dismissal, jeopardy would have attached.
Now, I think, except for the Jenkins case which is
to be argued next, everybody has always thought'that an

II
acquittal was an end to a proceeding.

This goes as far back

as 1896, in the Ball case, and 1904 in the Kepner case.
Acquittals end it.

So that what we are really

talking about is, at least in Serfass, is a pretrial
disposition of the case? in some fashion other than an
acquittal.
Now, what is the — what does this Act mean?
Now, if it — if it's not a truism.

Does it not address

itself to a situation where an indictment has been dismissed
short of a trial?
And if jeopardy has attached in that proceeding,
then double jeopardy clause of the Constitution would
prohibit this.
Now, I'm quite aware, sir, Mr. Justice White, of
your distinction in your dissent in the Sisson case, the
distinction made between technical and constitutional
jeopardy, and I'm quite willing to admit that the manner in
which we use the words "technical jeopardy" in our brief is
different from the way you used it, and, on further
reflection, I think that perhaps your distinction, if I
understand it, would be more appropriate.
But when does jeopardy attach is, to a large
extent, the question that's involved in this case.

And, in

fact, what is jeopardy?
Now, the government argues that there1s no jeopardy

12
until there's been a trial, either by jury or a trial by a
judge alone.
QUESTION: They don't quite go that far, do they?
MR. DOWER:

Repeatedly in their brief they do.

QUESTION: Well, jeopardy would attach as soon as
the jury was empaneled.
MR. DOWER:

Well, this would be included within

the term "trial”.
QUESTION:
MR. DOWER;
QUESTION:

That's not a complete trial, though.
Oh, no, sir.

They quite

When did jeopardy, in the sense of

exposure to a judgment of guilt, begin under this motion?
MR. DOWER:

I'm not so sure, sir, that that is the

import of all the cases.

It would be — I don't believe

that this Court in Sisson, for example, went so far as to
say that exposure to guilt was necessary.

And '-this' is —

Well, really what I would argue is that we ought to
determine what is involved in a trial, whether it's by jury
or toy judge alone, and I submit, sir, that.this is the
fact-finding process, generally as to the merits'or as to
seme issue which would permanently — which would dispose of
the case.
Now, I don't sea any mystical value in a trial as
such, or empaneling a jury to commence a trial.
a jury —

Because what

13
QUESTION; Except that you can’t go to jail without
it.
MR. DOWER %

Well, again, sir, you are , as I

understand your question or comment, unless a man has been
exposed to being held guilty, he's not been in jeopardy.
And this, I submit, sir, has not been the holding of this
Court, as recently as Sisson.

That one could — although

the facts of the Sisson case are different, nonetheless this
Court did cite with approval a large number of cases in
which jeopardy was held to have attached prior to exposure
to a finding of guilty.
QUESTION:
MR. DOWER;

And I'd agree with this.

Like what?
All the cases, sir, reach so hard,

as did the majority in this Court, to find that the
determination made by the court was an acquittal, and I
suggest, sir, that you don’t need to constrict yourselves by
the label of an acquittal.
That once fact-finding has commenced, and reference
to an issue that .would dispose of the case, that this is when
jeopardy attaches.
Now, the reason I say this and argue in this
fashion is that the, all the old cases which talked in terms
of jeopardy arising upon a trial or an empaneling of a jury
when our pleading and practice procedure was such that this
was nearly the only way to dispose of an issue.

14
Vie did not have Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(1),
or really Rule 12, in all its parts.
The common law, aside from the motion on arrest of
judgment, which, gave everybody so much trouble in the Sisson
case, and the motion in bar, aside from that nearly the only
way — the only way that I know of -- to dispose of a case
was by a trial.
Now, in the last seventy years we have developed
new and modem methods of pleading and practice.

They

started with the Code pleading as adopted in the States in
•the lata 1330's.

We. had Rules of Civil Procedure, federal

rules? and in 1946, I think is the date, the adoption of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
And we have dona away with the old common”law terms
of demurrer, speaking demurrers, yet a speaking demurrer under
common law was prohibited? yet, this is precisely — I’m
sorry, this is what? it’s not really precisely.
what Rule 12(b)(1) providas for?

This is

some method of disposing of

issues prior to a full trial, where, if you like, -the court
must go outside of the indictment, the bare-bonaS indictment,
in order to make the determination.
Rule 12(b)(4) provides for the holding of a hearing
to make these determinations.
There's another, Rule 47, I believe it is, which
permits the filing of an affidavit in connection with these

15
things.
New, this is different from ‘the 1907 Act.

The

way these issued can be brought before a court today are
entirely different.

We now —■ and this is what was done

in the Serfass case.
Now, there was no dispute as to any of the facts
in the motion to dismiss the indictment.
All the government’s evidence, incidentally, was
in, was before the judge.

Although I quite agree there was

no possibility of finding him guilty at that time.
But the Court did consider the entire bit of
evidence that the government had.
This is also noted, not in precisely those terms,
in the government’s brief, in the last several pages of
their brief they also acknowledge ..that what happens in the
prosecution of a Selective Service case is that the government
gets "the entire Selective- Service file into evidence'-as a
business record.

Occasionally there will be an officer

from the Induction Center to testify, but whatever evidence
the government has is in the Selective Service file.
Now, that was the situation in the Serfass case.
Unlike Brewster, for example, where this Court held that an
appeal would lie from an order dismissing the indictment,
where one did not have to go outside the indictment for the
disposition of the case.

IS
But here this was necessary.
Mowt I propose, or submit, Your Honors, that in
this part of the Twentieth Century what double jeopardy means
or should mean is that jeopardy attaches when -the fact-finding
process begins, as to an issue which would dispose of the
case.
Mow, no case that X have read speaks in' those terms ,
precisely in those terms; but there are a number of cases in
the Circuit Courts that have held to this effect.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dower, I gather -that your basic

submission is that what happened here, since the disposition
of the motion was made on the basis of the file and other
evidence, that is, you say ifc represents what would have
been the government’s entire case had a jury been convened
and the case tried.
MR. DOWER?
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.
That this should be treated as a

functional equivalent of an acquittal, even though you concede
there could not have been any judgment of guilt.
MR. DOWER; We argue that
QUESTION?

Well, is that right?

Is that what you-—

MR. DOWER?

Yes, sir, in our brief we're arguing

in. that fashion.
QUESTION: Well, aren’t you still arguing that?
MR. DOWER;

No, I’m going beyond that, sir, and I'm

saying that let's not confine ourselves to labels of
acquittal, in order to find that double jeopardy ~~ that
jeopardy has existed.

Because this is what has caused so

much trouble, at least to my analysis.

All that we need to

say is that jeopardy attaches when a fact-finding process
begins.
And that you don’t have to reach, as I am in
great sympathy at least in part with the dissentered in
Sisson, that there was a tremendous reaching to find acquittal
in order to bring -the case within the ambit of the old commonlaw cases.
And I submit, sir, that this isn’t necessary any
more, given our —* particularly Rule 12, 12(b)(1).

I would

go back, Mr. Justice Brennan, to one other observation.
The real functional equivalent of this Serfass case is one
in which — again it's a motion which is no longer used,
it's a common-law motion •— there is a demurrer to the
evidence at the conclusion of the government's case.
This is in effect what we were doing.

We now

call it a motion of acquittal,
QUESTION?

A demurrer to the evidence —

MR. DOWER:

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION:

A demurrer to the evidence, if it

succeeded, had the effect of an acquittal, didn't it?
MR. DOWER:

Yes, sir, it would have.

QUESTION :
MR. DOWER:

Under the old practice?
Right, sir.

And also, Mr. Chief

Justice, and Mr. Justice Marshall, a demurrer to the evidence,
if sustained, would not have run the risk of — well, a
demurrer to the evidence under common law would not have .run
the risk of a finding of guilty.

This has been our custom

for centuries.
QUESTION: The consequence of what you're arguing,
though, is that in these circumstances this motion, in itself,
becomes the trial of the case, if it has the outcome that it
had
MR. DOWER:

In so far as a discharge of the

defendant is concerned, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

If the defendant is successful, it has

the effect of being a trial of the case?
MR. DONER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now, is it not true that under the

federal statutes, in order to have a jury“waived trial in a
criminal case, you must have the consent of die prosecution,
the defense, and the court?
MR. DOWER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now, do you think that statute is any

barrier here —
MR. DOWER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
— or have the parties just slipped side-

19
ways into a trial on the merits without having consented to
submit the issue on the merits to the court?
MR. DOWER;

No, sir, the whole import of Rule

12{b) (1) is to take a look at these tilings at the very
beginning of the proceedings , and if there is a thorough
and valid defense, no issue of fact involved,, you see,
there’s a thorough and valid defensa available, it ought to
be considered at the outset, and if this results in the
discharge of the defendant, fine, let's get on, dispose of
the matter in that fashion.
If it does not, Rule 12(b)(5) says his plea stands
and you proceed, if necessary, to trial.
QUESTION;

Except that you said a moment ago that

your hypothesis to double jeopardy was when the fact­
finding process beings.

Nq"w you say that in this Rule 12

motion there's no issue of fact involved.
MR. DOWER;

No, sir.

Under Rule 12(b)(1) if it's

— and 12(b)(4), if it's necessary to support the motion to
dismiss, you can file an affidavit or the court can hold a
hearing,
QUESTION;

But on a motion like that, can the

judge who hears the motion find facts, rather than simply
decide whether, as a matter of

lav;, there's any support cf

the government's case?
MR. DOWER;

Yes, sir.

As occurred in this case.

20

Judge Sheridan found the facts in the Selective
Service file»

He didn't make a formal finding of fact;,, you

know, he didn’t delineate a portion of his opinion in this
fashion, but his opinion —
QUESTION: Then it isn't just a question of law?
MR. DOWER:

Oh, no, sir.

If it’s purely a

question of law, such as was -the situation in the Brewster
case, then I would say that the 1971 version of -die
Criminal Appeals Act would permit an appeal.

Because there
And all it is,

all that is involved is a question of law.
QUESTION:

I'm confused, Mr. Dower.

Sheridan had before him all of the evidence -that would have
constituted the government’s case
MR. DOWER:
QUESTION:
MR. DOWER:

had it gone to a jury.
Yes,sxr»

QUESTION: And that he appraised that for sufficiency
to get to the jury.

Yes,- sir.

MR. DOWERs

Yes

sir.

QUESTION : And new you say there's some fact-finding
involved with that?
MR. DOWER:

In his consideration of the Selective

Service file, which is the entire government's case.
QUESTION:

Isn't it merely conclusion that those

facts do not amount to a sufficient evidence to convict?
Isn't it more a conclusion of law than it is a finding of
fact?
MR. DOWER:

He would have to have the facts

before him, sir, before the District Judge -QUESTION:

Well, if he's got the facts there,

the docket, what does he find that that is the file?
MR. DOWER:

No, sir, these facts are not on -the

The Selective Service file comes into evidence at

the trial.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand —

MR. DOWER:
QUESTION;

/hid in this case by stipulation.
I understood his order said, "I

conclude that the motion to dismiss is legally correct."
Isn't that what he said?
MR. DOWER:

Yes, sir, but this was in consideration

of the entire Selective Service file, which came in to him
bv stipulation rather than empaneling a jury and then having
a stipulation or having the government offer it.

QUESTIONS

And he made a finding of fact?

MR. DOWER:

His decision is based on the facts

which he found from the Selective Service file.
QUESTION:
•that’s all

And his finding was a conclusion,

I don’t want to get all involved in facts and

law right here.
Your point is that he made a conclusion of law
that these facts would not be sufficient to convict this man.
MR. DOWER;

Yes, sir.

But he had to find the

facts first, which were not a part of the judgment rule
in the common-law sense, were not a part of the indictment,
and these were the things that were necessary for him to
determine before he could reach his conclusion that tills
evidence which the government had would not be sufficient
to convict.
I notice the white light is on.
I would just offer one other suggestion —Well, I would just repeat, that I think that far too often
courts, lawyers have been struggling to attach a label of
acquittal on a pretrial disposition or on some disposition
of a case in order to bring it into the common-law rule.
This is no longer necessary, given, particularly,
Rule 12, 12(a)

and 12(b).

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Korman...

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. K0RMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KOEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit., to
review a judgment of that Court , which sustained its
jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the United States from a
pretrial order of the District Court dismissing an indictment
on the merits.
The Court of Appeals also reversed the order of the
District Court and remanded the case for a new trial Or
other proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.
The petition for certiorari, which was filed here,
did not in any way challenge the determination of the Court
of Appeals oil the merits.

It challenged only the determina­

tion of the Court of Appeals that it could, consistent with
the double jeopardy clause,, entertain the appeal by 'the
United States.
Before getting into the merits, I'd like to address
myself to one question that occurred to us, and which we've
looked into, and that is the availability of the President's
pardon and clemency program to these defendants, should the
Court delay its decision beyond the 31st of January of 1975.
We have been told, and counsel for both Mr. Jenkins

24
and Mr. Serfass have been advised that if they wrote to
•the respective United Statas Attorney's Offices and indicated
their intention to avail themselves* or their desire to
avail themselves of the alternative-service program should
there be a judgment in this Court adverse to them* they
could preserve their rights to participate in the alternative
service program' even if they ultimately applied for it after
January 31st* because of a delayed decision of this Court*
which might be adverse to them.
To turn to the merits of the appeal in this case*
there are really two issues presented.
First* the issue of whether the Congress intended
to authorize the appeal from this order.

The Criminal

Appeals Act provides that the United States can appeal to
the Court of Appeals from a decision, order* or judgment
dismissing an indictment in a criminal case* unless the
double jeopardy clause would bar further prosecution.
Moreover* in order to overcome the restrictive
interpretation that had been placed on a similarly worded
earlier Criminal Appeals Act, which had limited the
government's right to appeal from dismissals only where the
dismissals were 7-" permitted appeals* rather, only where the
dismissals were based on the four corners of the indictment.
Congress deliberately wrote in to Section 3731
a rule of liberal construction* and mandated that the statute

25
be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
Not only from this language but from the legislative
history of the Criminal Appeals Act, it's plain beyond any
doubt 'tliat Congress intended to authorize the appeal in
question here.

Indeed, the Senate Judiciary Committee, in an

excerpt quoted at page 16 of our brief, observed that2
"The problems of appealability have become
especially serious in selective service cases where judges
have reviewed defendants' selective service files before trials
and dismissed the indictments after finding that there have
been errors by the draft boards.

These are issues to be

determined by a judge, not a jury, and there is no reason why
they should not be subject to appeallate review."
Congress not only was concerned: about all pretrial
dismissals, but particularly those in selective service cases.
And it’s quite pi aim and indeed, from reading petitioner19 s
brief, we had assumed that ha had conceded the issue that

f

the statute quite plainly intended to authorize the appeal
from the pretrial order dismissing the indictment in this
case.
This brings us, then, to the second question that's
presented, and that is whether an appeal from this order is
barred by the double jeopardy clause.
And in this connection it's worth again recalling
the words of the Constitutional provision, "nor shall any

26

person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb."
Now , while that term has a certain degree of
vagueness and has never been given a completely clear and
fixed definition, one thing is certain from every case that
has ever construed the double jeopardy clause of the
Constitution, and that is a person is not placed in jeopardy
until a trial has begun, at \7hich he is in danger of having
a judgment of conviction entered against him.
And until that time has come, he has not been
placed in jeopardy; and that the double jeopardy clause
protects a defendant against being tried, that is, being
placed in jeopardy of conviction for a second time, and, at
that, in cases such as Illinois vs. Somerville made clear,
the guarantee is not even absolute.
Now, tliis
QUESTION;

Well, that’s not quite true when you

come to the "twice being put in jeopardy", is it?

Or is it?

No, he could not.

put in jeopardy — it doesn’t really mean what you indicate,
does it?

provision stand for the proposition that if a person has

MR. KORMAN:

No, it's not that broad.

If he's

been put to — put in jeopardy, and the trial has ended in a
conviction or an acquittal, he can't be put to the trouble
and expense of another trial.
Now, obviously, if he can't be tried, it would be

but — and he would have —•

it would not be proper for him to be indicted; and therefore

the government can still have a

second crack at the apple even because it has, where the
jury has been unable to reach a verdict.

-

On the other hand, where he's been acquitted or
convicted, that guarantee becomes absolute.
But in both instances, the determination as to
whether a new trial may ensue is essentially based on
questions of policy and the questions that go to the history
of the double jeopardy clause.

MR. KORMAN:

Well, I would think that if the event

happened, that is, a second indictment were brought, the
defense would be to dismiss that indictment on the grounds

o€ double jeopardy,
Now, whether you say that it's how — I think it
becomes, after a point, immaterial as to how you characterize'
it, whether you say

the indictment should be dismissed

because it can't be retried, and it's pointless to have that

indictment, or to say that after the acquittal even the
indictment itself is barred i$y I think — I think it just
turns on the language you use.
I don’t think it’s significant. The significant
part is, as this Court has repeatedly said, that it’s the
double jeopardy clause which protects against a second
trial for the same offense.
Now, my adversary has suggested that there are no
firm guides on which to instruct the court 021 hot? to proceed
in this case, which involved a pretrial dismissal.

And we

would suggest that there ore at least a hundred years of
precedent of this Court to guide it in deciding -this case.
The most succinct summary of the law in this area
was stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his opinion in Collins
vs. Boisel, where he said "the constitutional provision
against double jeopardy can have no application unless a
prisoner has, theretofore, been placed on trial.

The

preliminary examination of one arrested on suspicion of a
crime is not a trial; and his discharge by the magistrate
upon such examination is not an acquittal.

Even the finding

of an indictment, followed by arraignment, pleading thereto,
repeated continuances, and eventually dismissal at the instance
of the prosecuting officer on the ground that there was not
sufficient evidence to hold the accused, was held not to
constitute

jeopardy."

33
Indeed, this principle has been illustrated in
numerous cases decided by this Court under the old Criminal
Appeals Act f which permitted the United States to appeal to
tliis Court directly from an order of the District Court
characterized as a motion in bar entered before jeopardy has
attached.
And this Court consistently held, in construing that
statutef that where the defendant has not been put to trial,
he has not been put in jeopardy.
And I think that of particular significance, to the
issue here are the cases which involved appeals to this
Court from motions in bar which sustain the defense of the
statute of limitations.
Those — that defense goes to the general issue in
the case and, as a matter of fact, in two opinions of this
Court, a pretrial order dismissing an indictment on statute
of limitations grounds was characterized as an acquittal.
Nevertheless, this Court.has repeatedly entertained appeals
from such orders because the defendant had not been placed
in jeopardy.
The most recent of that was in United States vs.
Goldman, in which the issue, the same arguments that were made
here were made there, it was an appeal from a dismissal on
statute of limitations grounds, which goes to the general issue
in the case, it was a pretrial dismissal, and this Court,

34
rejecting a challenge to its jurisdiction, stated that sines
the District Court had not commenced its sitting for trial,
the defendants in error had not then been placed in jeopardy.
Now, the defendant, of course, concedes that in
fact the jeopardy had not attached.

Instead, he argues that

because of the fact that the dismissal of the indictment
was the functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits,
that constructively jeopardy has attached.
Now, this argument which really takes us to the
first of the Court of Appeals decisions, which have denied
the government the right to appeal from pretrial orders, is
based on what we believe to be a serious misconception' of
the meaning and purpose of the double jeopardy clause.
We don't have to quibble over terms.

We can

concede that if an acquittal is a termination of a ruling in
favor of the defendant after the trial on the issue of
guilt or innocence, that may be characterized as an acquittal
and that a pretrial dismissal on the merits may be viewed as
an analog of an acquittal.
But the reason that a defendant cannot be tried
again after he has been tried once and acquitted is not
necessarily because he has been acquitted, but because he
has been placed on trial and been put in jeopardy of convic­
tion once, and so the double jeopardy clause affords him
protection, not only from an acquittal but a conviction and

35

svan protection against a second trial where the jury did
not reach a verdict if the case was terminated improperly
prior to verdict.
And so that it makes little sense to say that the
argument that this is somehow an acquittal doesn’t really
answer any question at all.

The question is whether he has

been placed once in jeopardy and whether# if the government
is successful on its appeal# he would be placed in jeopardy
a second time.
And it was this critical distinction which we believe
was overlooked# for example# by tie Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit in United States v. Ponto # which has become
the leading Court of Appeals decision on -tills issue.
There# in an excerpt quoted at page 34 of our brief#
the Court of Appeals, in a case not different from the
instance case, said that?
"Since the dismissal order ’was based, on a "determina­
tion on the merits, it was an acquittal to which jeopardy
attached."
Now# it's interesting to note# in the Green case#
which is one of ‘the case that’s cited by the Court# Mr.
Justice Black wrote for this Court that;

It is the acquittal

which ends the. jeopardy that has attached at the commencement
of trial.

It’s not an acquittal -- it’s not jeopardy which

attaches to an acquittal.

36

Moreover, the Court of Appeals continued;
"Thus, government appeal from this ruling would
violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment
since a retrial on the charge would be prohibited.”
But whan was he tried initially on -the charge?
The Court of Appeals never addressed itself to -that issue,
and it's not surprising that of the five judges of the
Seventh Circuit who composed the majority, two of the five
did not even join in this reasoning, and -they adopted yet
another analysis, which the Ninth Circuit has also
subscribed to.

And they said that since this was a dismissal

with prejudice and since, therefore, the government could not
bring a second prosecution, therefore it was barred from
appealing.
And in making this argument, the Court relied on
an opinion of this Court, in;

United States

v. Oppenheimer.

That case was a case in which the., government had indicted
someone for violating the Bankruptcy Act, conspiracy to
defraud — commit fraud under the Bankruptcy Act.
The defendant made a motion to dismiss on statute
of limitations grounds.

The motion was granted. The

United States never appealed.
Subsequently, this Court had, in a decision, had
redefined and clarified the law in the area, and it was
plain that the initial determination of the District Court

37
dismissing the indictment was an error.
Tbs United States then brought a second indictment
against the defendant, and he then alleged that that second
indictment was barred, either under the doctrine of res
judicata or the double jeopardy clause.
And this Court held that the second indictment
was barred because the failure of the government to appeal
from the first indictment left standing on the record a final
order on the merits, and that the civil law doctrine of res
judicata applied to a criminal case, even to a pretrial
dismissal on the merits, where the government had not
appealed but sought to bring a new indictment, the defendant
could in effect invoke the doctrine of res judicata.
But, of course, that does not — does not follow
from that that the government could not appeal from the
initial dismissal of the order, and of course in United States

vs. Goldman, to which 1 referred to afterwards, which was
'decided after United States v. Qppanheimer, this Court
entertained an appeal, a direct appeal from the dismissal of
an indictment on statute of limitation grounds.

QUESTION;

Court of Appeals, and that determination is not even challenged
here.
I agree that had they gone to trial, it would
have been foolish to go to trial with the judge entertaining
the erroneous view of the lav/ that he had.

But that doesn't

necessarily fallow from that that the defendant was placed
in jeopardy of a conviction by the pretrial disposition that
took place here.
QUESTION;

And if the — Mr. Serfass, whatever

his narae is, decided that he would go to trial and he
wouldn't put on any evidence or anything, would he, he's in
good shape, as long as he's before that judge?

Now, of course, —

MR. KORMAN;

Well, it's the end of the — it's —

QUESTION:

He would have keen acquitted, wouldn't

he?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, I assume the judge would have

done the same thing, and that's what involved in Fir. Fray's
case, where that's exactly what happened.
QUESTION:
MR. KORMAN:

Yes.
I would note, however, that judge,

even Judge Friendly, in his opinion in Jenkins, suggested
that if a defendant had available to him a defense which he
could have raised before trial, that involved no disputed
issue of fact, and deliberately permitted himself to be placed
in jeopardy and then delayed his motion in order to gain tills
tactical advantage, that that was a question he ’was leaving
open and was not deciding.
And indeed, we would argue, if we were faded with
that, tliat where a defendant did that, knowing that he had a
defense available to himself and let himself be placed in
jeopardy, that the protection of the double jeopardy
clause should not be accorded to him, but that need not be
reached in this case.
So that the second, what we think to foe misguided
ground upon which the Courts of Appeals have erred, is -this
misunderstanding of the doctrine of res judicata.

That is

because the doctrine would bar a second indictment, where the
first indictment was dismissed and not appealed from, therefore,

40

for some reason, the government could not appeal from the
initial pretrial dismissal.
Yet a third ground which was suggested by the
Courts of Appeals is one similar to that suggested by Mr.
Justice Marshall.

That is , if you say that -the government

can appeal from the pretrial dismissal, that V7ill only
discourage defendants from making their motion prior to
trial, and that will only delay it until jeopardy has
attached.
Well, of course, that — vhafcever merit there may
be to that consideration of policy, however, doesn't answer
the question here, since Congress has authorised the appeal
and has made the determination of policy itself, and has
determined to permit that appeal here.
And, of course, second, if it does become a
problem, this Court, either through its rule-making powers,
or Congress through legislative action can provide and mandate
that these motions be made prior to trial, otherwise they'll
be deemed waived, as is true now with motions directed to
defects in. the institution of the prosecution.
So that essentially the Findley case, United States
v. Findley, involved policy considerations that are no longer
open to this Court to consider, since Congress has decided
itself that it wants the United States to have the right to
appeal from these pretrial dismissals.

41
Moreover s- there really isn't any reason to depart
from this long line of precedent# to overrule any number of
decisions of this Court.

None of the considerations which are

reflected by the double jeopardy clause are really applicable
here# the defendant was not put through any burden and expense
and trauma of trial# he was not put through a hearing or
determination of fact# which could have resulted in a convic­
tion.
All that occurred hers was little more than the
argument of a legal question.

As a matter of fact# there

was a good deal less here than -that which occurs at a
suppression hearing# where the judges actually hear evidence,
where they make the determinations of credibility and where
their decision on whether to admit or not to admit a particular
piece of evidence could very well be decisive of the case.
Here all that took place was an argument on a
motion.

The Selective Service file# of course# is —

contains undisputed facts# which is true in every Selective
Service case. The defendant rarely ever disputes -that he
failed to report as ordered# and his only defense can be
based on something that may be in the Selective Service file.
So that the facts are never in dispute here,

Thera

was no trial of any issue of fact# and the defendant had not
been placed in jeopardy.
And for these reasons we believe there is no reason

42

to deny and to defeat the intent of Congress to authorise
the appeal here, or to overrule a long line of decisions of
this Court.
We therefore ask that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals be affirmed.

Thank you, Mr. Korman.

You have about three minutes left, Mr. Dower.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY A. DOWER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DOWER:

I'll be brief, sir.

I would respond to the government's position in
reference to what is involved in jeopardy by saying that a
person has got to go through the burden and expense and the
emotional strain of a-trial.
' *

I think this is really — these statements in the
case is far too narrow.

Certainly a person, many people are

terrified upon receiving a traffic ticket.

The emotional

strain can start as soon as that.
Certainly when a person is indicted, he's going to
go through a lot of burden and an expense and emotional
strain, too.
QUESTION? Well, is there any power you know of,
even in a true double jeopardy case, as to which no one would
disagree, that is a verdict of acquittal, if an irresponsible
jury, as I suggested before, a grand jury reindicted, it

43
creates all this stress, does it not, that you’re speaking
of?
MR. DOWER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, and I should —
Is there any other way to deal with that

indictment except to go in and assert the claim of double
jeopardy and have it
MR. DOWER: The first, time it would occur, sir, I

MR. DOWER:

It’s inconceivable that

But, sure, within the ambit of what is conceivable —•
QUESTION;

That is, the grand jury might not be

informed by the prosecutor that the man had been previously
tried and acquitted, and then you'd have perhaps various
kinds of proceedings against the prosecutor.
MR. DOWER:

I should hope so.

I would just say that, once again, I sense that
the government, as so many of us have been doing, has just
put too much emphasis on labels, and that we really ought to
look at the function of these things.
What is a trial?
and emotional strain?

In terms of the burden and expense

It doesn't have really to be — I’m

suggesting that jeopardy in that sense arises well before a
jury is empaneled.

And with -the modern methods of disposing

of issues before a court, prior to the empaneling of a jury,
we don't need to read these -things so narrowly.
I would also just respond to the closing statement
made by Mr, Korman, in reference to the sophisticated -and I'll be kind — the sophisticated defense counsel who
waits until a jury has been empaneled to bring his motion
to dismiss.
He says that this Court, by its rule-making, could
probably require these motions be made prior to trial.
I would not be so hasty to conclude to that.

I

Would assume that a rule of that kind would require a great
amount of public discussion before it could be even — even
could bs considered for adoption.
Thank all.
