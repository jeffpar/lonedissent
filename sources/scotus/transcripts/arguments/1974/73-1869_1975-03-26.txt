PROCEEDINGS

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argu­

ments next in No. 73-1869, Peter H. Beer against United
States et al.
Mr. Stoner, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. STONER, ESQ.
MR. STONER:

Mr. Chief Justice and rnay it please

the Court:
This case comes to the Court as an appeal from
the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia from a decision by a three—Judge court pursuant
to the Voting Rights Act of I965.
It deals with tho City of New Orleans.
The City of New Orleans, in 1954, adopted a
reorganization of its form of government, adopted a mayorcouncil form of government whereby the mayor of the city
assumes the executive functions and a seven-man, sevenperson council assumes the legislative functions of the
city — the governing of the city.
The plan provides for the two members of the
council to be elected at large from the entire city and
.«.Ive members to be elected from specific geographic areas
of the city.
Now, the city charter requires that after each

federal dicennial census, the council of the city has the
obligation to redistrict the five geographic areas of the
city so that each area in each district will be, as nearly as
possible, consisting of an equal number of voters.
The City Charter, as I said, makes this mandatory
after each dicennial census.
This case comes to the Court to be adjudicated
following the 1970 dicennial census and a plan that was
adopted by the city council but a little bit of history might
be appropriate in considering the posture of the case.
First, following the 1970 census, the city council
had the obligation to redistrict the five geographical areas.
They undertook to do this by the adoption of a plan, plan 1
referred to in the briefs and record.
Now, this plan was submitted to the Attorney
General pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of *65 which creates
a system whereby a changed plan can be made operative in the
event that the Attorney General doea not enter an objection.
In this case, while the Attorney General of the
United States was considering the plan, there was talk and
movement in the city for a procedure whereby the City Council
of the City of New Orleans could be enlarged and, indeed,
during the time that the Attorney General was Considering the
iirst plan, the City Council did, in fact, adopt
ordinance increasing the size of the City

an

Council from seven

5
members to 11 members.
This proposed 11-member council consisted of
two at-large and nine geographic.

This proposal was

submitted to the electorate of the City of Hew Orleans and
was defeated in‘a citywide referendum.
The City Council then adopted a plan whereby the
size of the City Council would be increased from seven
members to nine members, with two at-large and seven from
specific geographic districts.
This, again, was submitted to the electorate and
upon the referendum the proposal was defeated.
Now, following this, the Attorney-General of the
United States interposed an objection to Plan 1.
Now, where does that leave the City Council of
New Orleans?

It leaves the City Council of New Orleans

with the obligation to redlstrict itself for the five
geographic districts on the basis of a five—geographicdistrict council and two at-large.
•it did so.

It adopted what has been referred to

in the brief as Plan 2 and this plan was submitted to the
Attorney-General of the United States.
The Attorney-General interposed an objectiori and
upon Interposing this objection — following the imposition
of the Attorney-General’s objection, the city brought an
action pursuant to the ¥oting Rights Act of 1965 in the

6
United States District Court for the District of Columbia
asking for a declaratory judgment and asking the three-judge
court to declare that the plan as adopted — that is9 Plan 2
be made operative and be held to be in compliance with the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.
QUESTION:

The City could have done the same thing

earlier after the expression by the Attorney General of
disapproval of Plan 1.
MR. STONER:

It could have done —
It could have, your Honor.

The

machinery in the statute allows either an action for a
declaratory judgment or a submission to the Attorney General.
Yes, it could have.
QUESTION:

Is there any indication In the record

of why it didn't go to court and seek approval of Plan 1?
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

There is no record, no —
Right after the Attorney General's

action it formulated Plan 2 and submitted that to the
Attorney General.
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

That is right.
He disapproved that and then the city

went co court and that is the case we now have.
MR. STONER:

That is right, your Honor.

That i3 right, your Honor.
Now, the District Court, the three-judge District
Court held that Plan 2 was in violation of the Voting Rights

7
Act of 1965 and it is that we disagree with.
Now, let's look at what this case is and maybe the
best "way to attack what the case is, is to ask what it is
not.
Tills case is not a case whex*eby a city or a
government is expanding its boundaries, annexing area as in
prior cases in this Court — it is not that kind of a case.
Nor is it a case where the city is changing from
an at-large district to single districts or from single
districts to at-large districts.
This is merely a case where the city —

the city

council is performing its obligation to redistrict itself
pursuant to the mandate in the city charter which, as I
stated, was adopted in 1954 — became effective in 1954.
So the case before the Court is a redistricting
of the five geographic districts.
Now, the court below held that the two at-large
seats had to be considered in the consideration of the five
geographic district and Its application under the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
'vie submit most vehemently that that is not at

issue and that this Court should overrule the District
Court on that point and the reason we state it is as follows:
The Voting Rights Act of '65 applies to changes
that are made in a voting system.

Now, this Court has held

8
that in addition to restrictions to the individual's right
to vote it also applies to cases in which a change in
boundaries, et cetera and we don't dispute with that issue.
We do, however, submit that the form of government
enacted by the City Council in its charter, in its home rule
charter of May 1, '5^ was a dual system.
It was a system that provided for the election of
two members of the council from tho entire city at large and
it was a system that required the election of five additional
members of the city council from geographic districts of
equal population.
Nov;, it might be helpful to the Court to look at a
map of the city.

I have here which is, incidentally, in the

Appendix at page 620 a color map of the City of New Orleans
and interposed on that colored map is the five districts as
composed in Plan 2 which is the plan before the Court.
The red portion of this map represents voters of
the black race.

The green dots represent voters of the white

race so that we see, upon an examination of this map that,
indeed, the white and the black voters of the city are
scattered throughout many sections of the city.
Uoi1, -».n looking at this I would also like to call
the Court's attention to the area in which the number C is
located.

This is the only part of the City of New Orleans

that .'.s across the Mississippi River from the other part of

9
the city.
In other words, the predominantly geographic —
the large predominant part is on one side of the city but
there is a small sliver on the other side of the city.
This section across the river is called Algiers
and the record shows that there were great differences of
opinion between the people of Algiers and the people of the
city as to the necessity of another bridge across the
Mississippi River and this is an important political issue
in the City of New Orleans, not only in the Algiers section
but also in the main section of the city Itself because
voters in one section of the city don't want the bridge to
be destroying parts of their city for the abutment and the
1 ■

piers of the bridge itself.
’•..

Now, this case involves several things*
ves people.

It invol­

It involves geography and it involves voters.

Of necessity, the city must be divided

geograph­

ically in order to meet the mandate of the city charter
creating the five geographic districts.

I refer to page 620 of the record which shovrs
the geographic redistricting of the city as it was made in
1961, following the '60 census

and as it, in fact, exists

at the present time because of

the inoperativeness of Plan

2 and you will note there that

the Algiers section of the

city is included in District A

and you will also note that

QUESTION:

And is it that those two parts, marked

"A,” they elect one councilman?
MR. STONER:

Is that it?

Yes, Mr. Justice, they do.

They are —

each one of the districts, that is, A, B, C, D and E elect
one member of the city council and as I stated, two additional
members of the state council are elected at large.
In other words, there Is a dual system; the atlarge system and the five geographic.
Now, this apportionment of the city is founded in
reason and founded in good reason.
of the city, city council, have

The two at-large members

the obligation of representing

all of the citizens of the City of New Orleans.

XX

Each geographic district Is represented by one
person on the council and presumably that person represents
the peculiar interest of that geographic area of the city.
And a very important factor in this case is the
Mississippi River and the economy of the City of New Orleans
as it is affected by the Mississippi River.
The Mississippi River is well-known as the access
to the Gulf of Mexico and it is a large and important
shipping Center in the United States and I guess, indeed,
in the world.
/

Now, there is testimony in this case — and I
refer to the testimony of Councilman Moreau and, I believe,
Councilman Ciaccio also testified concerning this — and
that is that in their minds they felt it was important that
each one of these five geographic areas should have some
of the river frontage as part of their geographic area
because of the tremendous importance of the river and
shipping to the economy and to the life of the city of the
people of New Orleans.
Plan 2, as adopted by the city council and the
plan which is before the Court, is also represented on page
624 of the record.
Comparing the existent plan, which is on page 621
and Plan 2, which is the plan before the Court on page 624,
we notice that in the redistricting plan the part across the

12
river* in Algiers in A has been transferred from section A
or from district A to district C.

This makes the entire

District C contiguous on both 3ides of the river.
It also enlarges geographic section A and geographic
section B.
Now, at the time the plan was being adopted and
considered by the city council the NAACP in the City of
New Orleans also submitted a plan of redistricting of the
city and this appears at page 625 of the record and I might
submit that the plan, you will notice in many respects, is
y ■

very similar, particularly with respect* to district A and
district B.
It is changed in that the Algiers section in the
NAACP plan is included in district Dj whereas the plan
adopted by the city council has the Algiers section included

in district C.
You’ll also note from the NAACP plan that district

frontage on the Mississippi River.

Another plan, we submit —
QUESTION:

Let's go back a minute. Why is it, on
of them
621, that one, two, three, four/are on Lake Pontchartrain?
What Is the reason for that?
MR. STONER:

Your Honor, the district lines which

have been followed in redistricting here have followed the

13
traditional north/south lines in the City of New Orleans.
In other words, the — when the wards of the city
were established, I believe it was in 1912.

The wards were

drawn on a north/south line and the district — indeed, the
district — that is, the plan that is presently operative
does operate on the north/south line and this plan operates
on the north/south line.
QUESTION:

But there is no significance to Lake

Pontchartrain because there is nothing there.
MR. STONER:

Not nearly as important as the

Mississippi River»
QUESTION:

It is up in that area that all the

incumbent councilmen live, isn’t it?
MR. STONER:

That is true.

That is true, your

Honor and it — I believe there is testimony in the record
that many members of the council felt it was important that
a councilman from one particular district represent also,
in addition bo the river frontage, that he also represent
diverse interests.
In other words, testimony given to counsel and
In the record that some of the councilmen felt that it was
important that a councilman be answerable not only to one
economic interest, one economic group or one social group
but, rather, that they be answerable to all and hence the
river frontage being included and hence some of the higher

income areas being included in the various districts.
QUESTION:

In Plan 2 which, as I understand it

is on page 624, that i3 the plan before us, isn’t it?
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

That is right, your Honor.
Of the five districts, four of those

also abut on lake Pontchartrain, don’t they?
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

That is right, your Honor.
All but B.

MR. STONER:

All but B, yes.

Now, of course, the peculiar curve of the
Mississippi, if you will note —
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

Right.
— there is a curve of the

Mississippi there which would appear that there has to be
a compact district and it is represented by district B.
QUESTION:

And under Plan 2, does each of these

districts, A, B, C, D and E, as you suggested just a moment
ago, take in a pretty broad spectrum, economic and social
groups ?
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

They do, your Honor.
Each on© of them.
The record reflects that.

It does, with the possible exception of B, which
is a predominantly black populated section.
QUESTION:

Right, and a downtown section.

MR. STONER:
section.

That's right, and part of the downtown

3ufc it also contains a great deal of the river

frontage and the businesses and the interests that are
represented by riverfront property and various people who
are located along the riverfront.
Now, Plan 2 was submitted to the lower court and
we are before this Court asking this Court to reverse
because we believe the lower court has made some grievous
errors in its decision.
Number one, we believe that the inclusion of the
at-large districts in the consideration of the five geo­
graphic areas was completely wrong and the reason we say
that is because the city charter has a dual system of
electing its council members.
It has a system of electing two at-large and it
ha3 a system of electing five and we submit that the Voting
Rights Act of '65 says that the Act applies only to those
changes that are made after November 1, 196*1.
Now, the change in the at-large system
been made by the Plan 2.

has not

It has left the city charter as it

was and for good reason.
The two at-large councilman, for instance , perform
other functions in the city government in addition to being
members of the city council.
For instance, one of them is the chairman of the

city council and that rotates between the two at-large
every four months.
In addition to that , the at-large members serve
on the water and sewer board and otherwise have other
functions as described in our brief.
QUESTION:

Would you say9 then, that the District

Court didn't have authority to review the provision as to
at-large counciImen because that wasn’t the change that was
introduced after the effective date of the voting rights?
MR. STONER:

Exactly, your Honor.

Exactly, that

Is our position.
QUESTION:

Do you understand that your adversaries

here today disagree with you about that?
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

I do, your Honor.
In their briefs.
Pardon?

I do,your Honor.

You do.

Well, we'll hear from them.

I thought from their

briefs they didn't seem to differ much about that

aspect

of your case.
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Mr. Stoner.
Yes, sir?
What would have happened had the City

of New Orleans done nothing after the 1970 census?

I

suppose someone could have brought an action :in

-he District

Court under Reynolds against Simms or those kind of cases
to compel them to redistrict.
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

I think —
Well, under your city charter, I suppose.
It is mandatory under the city-

charter.
QUESTION:

It is mandatory under your charter,

quite apart from —
MR. STONER:

So that a mandamus action could be

brought by any citizen to compel the city couhdil to do Its
Job, namely, to redlstrict.
QUESTION:

And under our case of Connor against

Johnson, the Voting Rights Act doesn’t apply to a redistric­
ting that is done under the Aegis of a federal court decree.
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

Correct.
I believe that is correct, your Honor.

So we submit, as stated, that the two at-large
seats, the court erred completely in considering the two atlarge seats.
Now, the court also erred grievously, we believe,
in the burden of proof statement which the court has made.
The Voting Rights Act allows a changed plan to
become effective upon the filing of a declaratory action in
the District Court — any finding that the plan complies with

18
the Voting Rights

Act of 1965•

The lower court in this case has said that the
moving party — that is, In this case, the city council of
the City of New Orleans must prove that the plan which they
are submitting is the only feasible plan.
Now, we submit that that does not comply with the
traditional declaratory judgment proceudre at all .
Congress established in the Act a declaratory
judgment procedure.

Now, ifhat is a declaratory judgment

procedure?
It is a procedure whereby parties come before a
court and ask for the adjudication of their Interests so
that they may proceed in the normal course of events or
the normal course of life.
In that kind of an action, declaratory judgment,
it has always been held that the burden of proof is by a
preponderance of the evidence.

Now, the lower court has

said that in this case, the moving party must prove that the
plan is the only — and I emphasize "only" feasible plan.
We submit that that just is not proper burden of
proof and, indeed, we may say that probably no plan could
be devised which is the only plan because we are dealing
here with people.

We are dealing with geography and without

belaboring the point further, we submit that the burden of
proof is entirely wrong.

19
QUESTION:

j take it you do concede you do have a

burden of proof.
We have a burden of proving and I

MR. STONER:

submit, your Honor, that we believe that the burden we have
is to show that the plan is a feasible plan and is based on a
rational basis — a rational basis.
We believe

that our burden is to show that the

plan is a plan founded in reason and in consideration of the
various factors which at play in any one area.
QUESTION:

Weil, do you think that you necessarily

win your declaratory Judgment action if it were found that
under the Constitution the plan was acceptable or, to put it
another way, do you think the statute adds something beyond
what the Constitution would require in terms of what you
have to prove v/hen you are making a change covered by Section
5?
MR. STONER:

Well, I believe the statute would

really emphasize our obligations under the 15th Amendment and
I believe that If we meet the constitutional test that we
have established, we carry the burden of proof,
QUESTION:

But this is the

voting,

I take it you

say this is a voting case, a 15th Amendment voting case
rather than an equal protection case?
MR. STONER:

Both apply and there are subtle

differences, I believe, in the eases.

The lower court

20
applied a compelling state -QUESTION:

The reapportionment cases have pro­

ceeded on the basis that they are —
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:

14th.
That their equal protection considera­

tions will solve them.
MR. STONER:

Isn't that right?
I believe that is corrects your

Honor.
QUESTION:

So are we talking here about a consti­

tutional standard under Section V or something that is
imposed by Section V?
It says — it speaks about depriving people of a
vote by reason of race or color, doesn't it?
MR,' STONER:

Yes, it says no statute or no pro­

cedure shall be enacted which deprives anyone or abridges
the right to vote on account of rase or color.
Honor.

Yes, your

The lower court has
QUESTION:

Let me ask you — but the statute

also prohibits you from adopting a procedure.

You have to

show the procedure doesn't have the purpose and will not
have the effect of denying or abridging the right.
Now, that has strictly been the constitutional
standard.

You are bound to come up with a statutory stan­

dard, I take It.
MR. STONER:

That is right, your Honor.

We would

21
submit that that Is not necessarily stricter than the
constitutional standards.
QUESTION:

And it is that double purpose, the

burden of which you are willing to assume.
MR. STONER:

You mean, purpose and effect?

QUESTION:

To assume the burden of proof, yes,

purpose and effect —
MR. STONER:
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

Yes —
— proving both of those.
Yes, the lower court in this case

— denying and abridging and therefore

said — pardon?

QUESTION:

If it has the effect, the act is

violated then, is it not?

If the plan has the affect without

regard to whether it has the purpose.
MR. STONER:

Well, we would submit that the statute

says the purpose and effect, that both must be met.
QUESTION:

And so you think that the three-judge

22

court was wrong in not addressing the purpose —
QUESTION:

On the law.

QUESTION:

— on the law.

MR. STONER:

On the law.

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Yes, I see.

QUESTION:

Now, going back to the constitutional

approach, is the same standard applicable under the 15th
Amendment, In your view, as it is under the 14th?
MR. STONER:

The 14th, I believe, would apply

more to a restriction on the individual right to cast a
vote.

The 15th is somewhat broader, I would believe.
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

And this is a 15th Amendment case?
Well, it is — it is, yoisr Honor,

but we also submit that the Court misapplied the compelling
state interest document.
What the lower court did here was said that unless
the black populace — population is given its maximal voting
strength, it has to be — the plan has to be denied unless
the moving party shows a compelling state interest.
Now, we submit that that is an improper test to
be applied in this case because we say the compelling state
interest test has been traditionally applied by the court
in cases in which there has been a restriction on the
individual right to cast a vote and I mean by that, cases
such as literacy tests and those kinds of cases.

We say that that kind of test is an improper test
in the Voting Rights Act of '65.
I see my time is up.

Thank yous your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Stoner.

Mr. Wallace.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In May,

1973 in Georgia against the United States.

this Court agreed with our longstanding interpretation that
the Voting Rights Act does apply to ^apportionments, re­
districting and thl3 is the first case in this Court which
raises the question of what the Act means with respect to
the redlstrictlng.
QUESTION:

You mean reapportionments or redlstrlctin

undertaken at the initiative of the legislative body, don’t
you?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct insofar as the Act’s

procedures are concerned.

I don’t understand Connor against

Johnson to hold that a court, In adopting a redlstrictlng
plan in a jurisdiction covered by the Act should not talcs
the substantive standards of the Act Into account when it
holds that the Act’s other procedures are not to be applied
in such a situation.
QUESTION:

Well, what It said was that the decree of

24
the United States District Court Is not within reach of
Section V of the Voting Right3 Act which certainly contains
substantive standards as well as procedurals doesn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

I thought it was in the contest of

whether it has to be approved

by the Attorney General or

the District Court for the District of Columbia and I don't
think the Court has addressed the question of the propriety
of a district court taking the substantive standards of the
Act Into account and I think there is a strong argument to
be made that Congress meant those substantive standards have
effect in the Jurisdictions covered by whatever procedure
may be the appropriate one in the particular case, your
Honor.
QUESTION:

So you seem to think, if It were

operating in a state not subject to Section V, the plan
might pass muster but It wouldn't pass muster In a state
covered by such an Act?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think there is a 3trong

argument and It was the position we took In the hearing —
QUESTION:

Yes, I know, but how would the

argument turn out?
MR. WALLACE:

— is that the Act goes beyond.

We haven't taken a position on that in this case
but we did take that position before Congress when It
reenacted the Statute in 1970 that Section V imposes

25

prophylactic substantive requirements beyond Just the
shifting of the burden of proof, which is a major factor in
your substantive result in addition and we stand by that in
our administration of the Act.
It was not so clear that the 15th Amendment without
this Act would prohibit a change in voting procedures
merely because it had the effect of abridging the right to
vote on account of race.

It depends on how you want to

interpret the right to vote on account of race, but the Act
is interpreted to mean dilution.
QUESTION:

How was the vote abridged in this case?

MB. WALLACE:

Well, as I Ju3t said, the Act has

been interpreted to mean dilution.

This was the language

used by this Court in both Perkins against Matthews and the ~
QUESTION:

Well, how was it —

MB. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

— Georgia case.

How was It diluted?

MB. WALLACE:

Well, this is what both we and the

District Court had to determine in looking at the plans that
were submitted.

First, the so-called Plan 1 and then Plan 2S

which was —
QUESTION:

Well, is the dilution a relative thing

as compared to what it used to be or is it compared with
what it could be or what?
MB. WALLACE:

Well, in reviewing these plans and

26

the bulk of them hair© been reviewed administratively
rather than in. Court, we start off with the prem3.se that the
question before us is not a comparison of the present
abridgement with the preexisting abridgement but that the
Act was enacted to enforce the 15th Amendment and that can
be accomplished only by looking at how the new procedure
will operate and see what effect it will have on minority
voting strength, whether it denies, on account of race

or

color, an equal opportunity for meaningful participation
in the electoral process, the standards that were quite
painstakingly developed by this Court in Whitcomb and
White against Kegester.
QUESTION:

No negroes — it is not charged that

negroes were denied the opportunity to register and vote in
this case.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Not at all.

Or that the plan had the purpose or

effect of denying anybody the right to vote.
MR. WALLACE:

There would be no point in having

t he Act apply to re apportionment if that were the only
question because all the reapportionments under the Reynolds
against Sims and its progeny have to result in fairly
equal districts in which everyone will have an equal
ballot from that standpoint.
The question is, what practical effect will that

27
have, what possibilities of racial gerrymandering is the Act
designed to protect against?
QUESTION:

And —

And so9 how u?as it diluted in this case?

MH. WALLACE:

In this case it was diluted by looking

at all the circumstances of the apportionment that was
involved here and there is no short answer to the question
in our experience because in addition to the premise that if
you look at the whole effect, we also start off with the
premise that the Act does not choose between differant theories
of political representation.
There is nothing per se invalid under the Act with
having two at large and five —
QUESTION:

The only — let’s assume that there is

only on© fact change In a new plan that is proposed, namely
that the Districts were drawn so that negroes xvould have three
representatives.
v'Ould you
about It, or would

still have to go through a long story
that satisfy the Attorney-General?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the way we have been

administering the Act is, we not only look at the face of the
submission, but we notify interested persons who have
registered with us of what has been submitted.

This includes

Civil Rights organizations and individuals in the community
at issue who have registered with us and we see what they
have to say about what the effect will be and then we often

28
a3k the submitting jurisdiction what they have to say7 in
response.
It Isn’t easy to ascertain whether, ifithin the
terms of the statute, a new procedure will have the effect
of abridging minority voting strength and minority voting
rights just on the face of the submission.
QUESTION:

Is the dilution comparitive or not?

Are you confronting with the maximum minority leverage that
might be gotten from a particular plan or are you concerned
with just what is in existence now?
MR. WALLACE:

We don’t — neither one, your Honor

and as I understand it, the court didn’t use either of
those criteria but used something in between, a comparison
with the percentage of that group In the community as a.
whole as a starting point and those figures are given In
our brief in a little chart on page 7 and that is where we
started off looking at this district and the District Court
did the same thing and It showed that, in the 1970 census,

Arc, fcnen we looked at the districts that were
drawn in the context of what they were drawn up for, which
was to apportion five district seats of a seven-member

council and the court found — and we think that this was
well-supported by the evidence, that the two at-large members
of that council, because of the background, and pattern of
racial block voting and voting procedures that were In effect
including a majority vote requirement numbered post, anti­
single-shot provisions with the racial polarization and block
voting, that those two at-large seats would be controlled by
a white block vote
QUESTION:

and —
But they were literally not changed.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

We never challenged them.

Well, how do you say —

MR. WALLACE:

We are saying you assess the five

districts in the context of what the city was being
districted for and that was five representative, seven-member
council, two members of which are controlled by the white
vote at the outset so you look at %© other five and see
whether the districting has denied the minority a fair
opportunity for meaningful representation on that council.
QUESTION:

But the District Court went ahead and

more or less set aside not only the new seats but the seats
at large and they literally are not within the language of
the Act.
MR. WALLACE:
large

The District Court said thft the at-

seats are themselves invalid feut it didn’t, have to

say that.

The question before the District Court was

BO
whether to Issue a declaratory judgment approving the new
plan and it had already given several quite independentlysufficient reasons xfhy the declaratory judgment should be
denied so that that was an addendum to the opinion which was
not something we were contending for and was unnecessary to
the result.
QUESTION:

And you do not support it here, do

you?
MR. V/ALLACE:

No, we are asking that the judgment

be affirmed.
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand that.

MR. WALLACE:

The District Court was right in

declaring the declaratory judgment but we have found no
reason in anything that has been brought to our attention
In this case to Impose the two at-large seat3 and we have
some doubt —
QUESTION:

Well, as a matter of record, they

are not even covered by the statute.
MR. WALLACE:

We have some doubt about that.

Interveners contend that it is.

We think — we never have

challenged It in this case and there Is no need to reach
that question in this case.
QUESTION:

Although the District Court did, in

its opinion, reach it.
MR. WALLACE:

The

It did and —

QUESTION:

And to the extent it did, its component,

one of the foundations of its opinion, isn’t it?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it Is an additional ground

given for denying the declaratory judgment but I think it
Is quite clear that the other grounds would be sufficient in
themselves in the view of the District Court and we urge
that there were other grounds for denying the declaratory
j udgment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, wouldn’t you think that

most people reading this opinion and considering the judgment
would think that if you are going to redistrict the city, like
New Orleans or a state and you know you are going to have to
get by Mr. Wallace and his colleagues and the Attorney
General’s office, that you really ought to take race Into
account In drawing your district
MR. WALLACE:

line?

Well, there is no way to draw them

without taking race Into account.
QUESTION:

Well, there is too.

It is easy.

You

could very easily draw them without taking race into account.
The only trouble is, If it happens to end up, like in this
case, it will be held to have the purpose and effect of
denying somebody the right to vote.
Now, how can you get around this judgment without
saying, affirmatively take race into account in drawing your
district lines'?

32
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, I —

You would say that you could.

MR. WALLACE:

Affirmatively — we don't say

affirmatively taken into account.

Obviously, if race is

not taken into account —
QUESTION:

You are going to get —

MR. WALLACE:

— at all, you can be assured that

your new procedure will not have the purpose of abridging
voting rights on account of this, but how will you know
whether it has the effect, unless you look to see what
effect it will have.
QUESTION:

Well, I agree; afterwards, you are

going to take race into account, but when you are drawing
■/

your districts, you really should, I take it — the Attorney
General thinnks — gerrymander on the

basis of race to

ensure that the minority group in the community has a fair
representation in the legislature.
MR. WALLACE:

Pair opportunity, fair opportunity—

That is just plain --

MR. WALLACE:

— to participate meaningfully.

That doesn't mean racial gerrymandering.

Because we don’t take —

You don’t?

MR. WALLACE:

No, no, no.

Because the Act doesn’t

The

Act doesn't choose between theories that —
QUESTION:

Gerrymander and you end up with a

pattern like there Is in this case, you are going to be in
trouble with the Attorney General.
I®. WALLACE:

Oh, yes, because in this case there is

a prevalent practice of racial bloc voting along with finding
that the city council members are not responsive to the needs
of the black community.
QUESTION:

Now you are proving ray point.

You really

ought to take race into account in drawing your districts.
MR. WALLACE:

To see whether your new procedure

will have the effect of denying the minority meaningful
participation in the political process.

That’s —

3^

QUESTION:

Do you think the Congress or do you

think the Act, Mr. Wallace, do you think the Act contem­
plates and intends to encourage bloc voting by racial
groups ?
MB. WALLACE:

No, we don’t.

We don't presume

bloc voting and we don’t think the Act is Intended to be
anything comparable to the statute struck down in Anderson
against Martin.

We don’t want to turn the Act into some­

thing like that but we have here a situation in which this
was the reality, bloc voting is occurring and partly nur­
tured by the statute struck down in Anderson against Martin.
which required racial identification on the ballot» and you
have got findings here that the black vote will, in effect,
be wasted except in districts in which the blacks are in
the majority.
You have got a special situation here which ought
to be taken into account in determining whether the purposes
of the Act are met and you combine that with a look at these
districts which are drawn as long north-south slivers
rather than compact districts and it is quite apparent that
while they may have made a great deal of sense at the time
when the black voters across the middle of the city weren’t
registered and weren't voting, you didn't want to have a
large district in the middle with Just a handful of white
voters controlling one councilman.

35
This pattern has now been perpetuated in a x$ay
that fragments the black vote, submerges the bulk of it
into majority white districts against the background of a
situation which they are finding supported by the evidence
of the pattern of racial bloc voting and of unresponsiveness
to the needs of the black community by persons elected
through this racial bloc voting.
That, it seems to us, to meet the standards of
White against Segester.
QUESTION:

So you are suggesting that if this case

had come up in a state not covered by Section V and It had
just — arose as an ordinary reapportionment suit by a
citizen claiming that It was discriminatory, that the case
would come up the same way?
MR. WALLACE:

Oh, I think it would be Quite a

different case.
QUESTION:

Well, you cited White against Regester.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we are citing it as an a for»

It was a constitutional case and In which

—[inaudible] findings were made and this very well could fee
a constitutional violation and —
QUESTION:

Well, you just said it was.

MR. WALLACE:

It wasn’t necessary for the District

Court to go that far and we didn’t have to contend that much.
QUESTION:

Well, you Just have, though.

You have

36
satisfied White against Regester and hence it is a
constitutional violation.
MR, WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, the factors —

Right?

MR. WALLACE:

I think that a strong argument

could be made to that effect.
on that.

We haven't taken a position

It is unnecessary here.

The fact

that we are

upheld by this Court it is sufficient to find the con­
stitutional violation In White against Regesters are very
comparable to the factors on which the District Court
relied here.
In addition to extraneous factors that weren't
necessary to the result, In our view and that Is the situa­
tion.

The findings sire detailed in our opinion — in the

Court's opinion and are recounted in the briefs and our
position Is that the District Court did reach the correct
judgment against the background here.

VJe have spelled out in some detail In our brief
why the guidelines used by the city to justify this parti­
cular reapportionraent either were not consistently applied
or could be satisfied equally well by a plan which would
not have the 3ame dilutive effects, the same fragmenting of
the black vote In this situation and we submit that the
judgment below should be affirmed, perhaps with some
clarification about the at-large situation here when — sine©

37
when a new plan is submitted — if a new plan, is submitted
to the Attorney-General we would

feel that an interpretation

of the Act by a court with respect to the at-large seats
would be something we should honor, just — if the opinion
can be read as saying that regardless of what is done with
the district, two at-large seats have to be rejected in this
case which is not the position we have taken.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Wallace.

Mr. HaXpin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. HALPIN, JR., ESQ.
QUESTION:

Mr. Halpln, before you start, will you

tell me \*hat happened to the Republican and the HAACP plan?
MR. HALPIN:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Republican plan was a plan submitted to the

**■>

council.

It was apparently never voted on and considered.
V

The NAACP plan was a plan submitted to the city council to
'consider in its redistricting.
I would specifically mention, so there is no
confusion, to this Court that we are not supporting the
NAACP plan nor have we ever and the evidence indicates, since
this came up in the trial court — evidence indicated that the
NAACP plan was submitted as a political expedient, a plan
which that

group thought might possibly be passed by the

33
council and be a little less worse than some other plan.
QUESTION:

Mr. HaIpin, do you think there is a

real difference between the NAACP plan and Plan 2?
MR. HALPIN:

I think the NMOP plan also discrim­

inates against black voters, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But you see no difference, really,

between the two?
MR. HALPIN:

Well, I think it is a little less

worse, if you want, but no significant difference.
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN:

Little dlfference.
No, sir.

Nov;, in that sort of — a series of questions
were posed to Mr. Wallace which I think this is sort of
suggesting and goes to what is the dilution in this case
and what is the standard under Section Y and does that
standard somehow require some sort of reverse or benign
g© rryman de ring.
I’d like to address that in this way.

I believe

the intention of Congress in enacting Section V, particu­
larly as it relates to redistricting plans, is set out in
the legislative history and in that history there is
repeated reference to the problem that once black voters
get registered in significant numbers, because of the
application of other sections of the Act, they would still
be faced in certain areas under certain political

t-

39
circumstances with a being cut off from the political —
from the process — cut off at the last step by districting
lines which would divide up these nevr ly - c on cen t rate d, newlyenfranchised concentrations of blacks, submerge them in
majority white districts and therefore, quite effectively
divide and conquer this vote.
Now, the hearings before Congress didn't leave it
"H

just at that.

The Congress was well-aware of the practice,

for instance, of bloc voting, of non-responsiveness in these
jurisdictions to the distinct interest of this minority.
In this case as well, the District Court — if you
would reexamine, perhaps unnecessarily, but .reexamine in
regard to New Orleans whether this type of factors existed
there.

'
And they did find that, for Instance, in New

Orleans up to — there was a large increase in black voting.
There was, in fact, a division of this black voting, that
there had been bloc voting in New Orleans and that the key —
that there had never been a black election to the city
council and that the city council had failed historically
and continued to fail to respond to the distinct interests
of the merits.
QUESTION:

So your suggestion is that the city, in

redistricting itself, should avoid dividing up the black
voting strength?

40

MR. HALPIN:

Your Honor, yes.

I think when there

Is a continuation —
QUESTION:

Which means some care as to drawing

your lines as to what it does to the minorities living in
a particular area?
ME. HALPIN:

Particularly here, your Honor, where

Plan 1 had, for Instance —
QUESTION:

Your ansirer is yes, you should take

care.
MR. HALPIN:

Yes, sir.

Once you have a violation

of Section V of this sort that has divided the black
concentration, the remedy, obviously, is to not divide the
concentration.
QUESTION:

Mr. Halpin, what if Plan 2 had been a

seven-member council all elected at large?

Would that have

violated Section V?
ME. HALPIN:
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN:

Absolutely, your Honor.
It would have?

And, of course, you know,

Yes, sir.

You speak of dividing the black

Looking at that map of Mr. Wallace’s brief

on page 620, the one with the green dots and the red dots —
MR. HALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— that doesn't strike me as what 1

would call a concentration.

It looks like the minority vote

would be pretty well spread out.
MR. HALPIN:
Honor.

I think it is a concentration, your

Of course, the District Court did find It to be so

considering other evidence besides Just looking at the map,
of course, but if the Court, for instance, would examine the
larger map which is the original exhibit and see that these
areas are cut off effectively from wide areas to the north
and the south and that it composes a rather consistent band
of concentration of blacks throughout the center of New
Orleans effectively cut off from white communities by natural
boundaries, cernetaries, lakes, canals and so on.
QUESTION:

What do you have to say

about the

burden of proof standard used by the District Court?
MR, HALPIN:

Your Honor, I think that here there

is no question under Section Y that the burden of proof is
upon the plaintiffs to demonstrate that both, the plan lacks
a discriminatory purpose and lacks a discriminatory effect.

42
I think there is no question as to the wording
in the statute.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is all the District

Court required?
MR. HALPIN:

Yes, sir, I do Indeed.

There is,

you know, and also I would note particularly in this case
that the burden question doesn’t become particularly
significant because the facts in the case are basically not
in dispute and vrherever the burden happens to be tilted
or shifted is not especially significants particularly In
regard to the effect.
I think here we are arguing primarily legal
standard and that there isn’t much contest as to ,just
precisely what the facts are.
QUESTION:

You don’t think —

QUESTION:

And the District Court said they had

that effect and therefore we don’t have to inquire into the
other element of purpose?
MR. HALPIN:

Well,your Honor, I think It is not

necessary to reach that.
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN:
of purpose.

However, I think there is ~

Is that what the District Court did?
Yes, sir, they premitted the question

I think the purpose, however, that — that

there is ample evidence In the record, to indicate that there
was a racially discriminatory purpose and that would provide

an alternative basis for this Court to determine, particularly
the bad faith of the council from Plan 1 to Plan 2 that after
the Justice Department had rejected Plan 1, Plan 2 was hardly
a good faith effort to correct that.
AisOj, 1 think the courts are more and more willing
to recognise purposeful discrimination from facts and
circumstances.

It is no longer a situation where white

officials bent on discrimination will get on the stand and
admit that they discriminated.
Now, I think there is the type of situation her©
where the Court could. In fact, find that there was such a
purpose.
I think, given the legislative history of Section V,
I think Congress did definitely intend to set up a different
standard than the 15th Amendment and under that standard
there might well be the Individual cases, say a redlstrictlng
plan # which would not be acceptable under Section V which,
under a particular constitutional case, wouldn't be declared
unconstitutional and this tost could be characterised a
couple of ways.
It could be characterised merely as an inference
of unconstitutional gerrymandering from these facts and
Circumstances or it could be characterized as a substantive
rule but in any effect, I think it

is very clear, after the

District Court decision In South Carolina versus Katzenbach

44
and In some other cases that it is quite possible that
Section V will prohibit a type of arrangement that might
not otherwise be unconstitutional in the individual case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Halpin, are you suggesting that

this ought to be looked at as sort of a remedy to a
historic practice of discrimination?
MR. HALPIN:

Yes, sir, I think what Congress is

intending — I think they saw that there was discrimination
in schools, in education, in jobs and so on, in voting,
going back down and the reason was that the elected officials
were able to Ignore the particular interests of the black
minority and by attaining to bloc voting and the like and
that Congress intended to eliminate this by preventing
the division, for instance, in redistricting plans, of these
concentrations of black voters so that the white incumbents
or politicians in power couldn't appeal and harness bloc
voting in such a way that they could then just ignore the
interests of blacks.
QUESTION:

of the five seats, the way It was rearranged was raciallydlscriminatory or not, necessarily would have to look at
other factors — as the Court said, a backdrop Including the
fact that the two at-large seats were there.
Now, this doesn’t mean that it is precluded under
any kind of situation, having two at-large seats.

They may

be — the District Court just found that the combination

47
under these circumstances of the two arrangements was
discriminatory.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Stoner, you have

three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. STONER, ESQ.
MR. STONER:

Thank you, your Honor.

May it please the Court, we have heard counsel for
the United States, the executive department of the United
- States Government, and we have heard counsel for the intervenors state that because of the two at-large seats the
white vote in the City of New Orleans starts out at the outset
with two seats.
Now, 1 submit to the Court that both counsel have
neglected to bring to the Court's attention the fact — and
the record shows this — that three blacks have been elected
in other elections in at-large elections in the City of New
Orleans in the past,
Judge Morieau was elected to the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals.
Judge Israel Augustine was elected to the
Criminal District Court.
And Dr. Spears was elected to be president of the
Orleans Parish School Board.

New Orleans Parish has the same

geographic limit as the City of New Orleans.

Mow, here are three blacks who have, in fact,
run. for political office city-wide in the City of New
Orleans and they have won and I will ask ray opponent counsel
to consent by stipulation of the court to also bring to the
Court's attention a natter which occurred in 197*ij> in
November, 197*1.
And I am referring to the election of Edward
Lombard on a city-wide basis, a black candidate elected to
the clerk of the Criminal District Court and in that
election he defeated a white incumbent candidate.
Now, I submit that we cannot start with the
proposition — and both counsel have taken that proposition
that in the 1970’s that —
QUESTION:

Well, why don’t you just come right out

and say that the finding of bloc voting is wrong because
that is what is really wrong,
• STONER:
QUESTION:
MR. STONER:

You are

right, your Honor —

Well, it —
— and I will say that.

And I will

say that the United States Government, by the executive
department, is encouraging bloc voting before this Court
right now and they are encouraging racial polarisation.
QUESTION:

When I asked Mr. Wallace something like

that, he said he did not think it was a purpose

of the Act

49
or the objective of Congress to encourage bloc or racial
voting.

I take it, obviously, you would agree with that.
MR. STONER:

I would agree with that, as a

matter of fact.
QUESTION:

But you say their practice in the

Department of Justice is not consistent with that expression
of philosophy.
MR. STONER:

Exactly.

Exactly, your Honor.

I

would submit that it is the obligation of government to
encourage peoples to live harmoniously together and the
history of the world shows that where people learned to

further submit that this Court must look at the conditions
in New Orleans as they existed in the 1970’s, not as they

Thank you.
