ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY PAUL MONAGHAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MONAGHAN;
may it please the Court;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice» and
This case is here on a writ of

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit.

It arises out of petitioner's unsuccessful

efforts to gain access to the Chattanooga, Tennessee,
%

Municipal Auditorium in order to exhibit the rock musical
HAIR.

HAIR is a rock musical which describes the life styles of

many young people in the late 1960's and early 1970's

and

their attitudes on such matters as war, the Vietnam war,
racism, drugs, et cetera.

In 1967 HAIR opened in New York.

Since then it has performed in 140 cities in the United
States and 14 cities throughout the rest of the world.

It

has received widespread critical acclaim.
When petitioner began to produce HAIR in the smaller
communities in the Southeastern and the Southwestern part
of the United States, it ran into considerable difficulties.
In these smaller communities the municipal auditorium frequently
holds a strategic position. It is the only or the best

4
available facility for the production of a major play.

And

in these communities many municipal officials were hostile to
HAIR's exhibition.
as follows:

In their brief respondents put the matter

They say:

Many local officials in tune with the standards of
their communities and particularly those in the so-called Bible
belt resisted the presentation of this notorious production.
(End of the quote.)
In claiming unlimited censorship rights to determine
what should or what should not be shown in the municipal
theater, these municipal officials refused HAIR access to
local auditoriums.

Federal district courts enjoined that

conduct, and those courts which did not do so were reversed
upon appeal.
This case began in such a fashion.

HAIR applied for

use of the municipal facility in Chattanooga and these
respondents refused HAIR access because they testified
exhibition of HAIR would not be, and I quote,"in the best
interest of the community, nor would it be a play which they
could characterize," and I quote, "as clean, healthful;, and
culturally uplifting."
QUESTION:

In any of these other cases that you

mentioned involving this production, were the proceedings
brought after it had been one or more performances?
MR. MONAGHAN:

All before, your Honor.

5
QUESTION?

All of them were excluded.

MR. MONAGHAN;

They are all exclusion cases, and we

went into the appropriate U.S. district courts and obtained
orders.
Petitioner thereupon in this, case filed a complaint
in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee
taking the position that respondents' refusal to permit
access to the theater should be enjoined.

The district court

held an evidentiary hearing which focused essentially on the
question of obscenity.

The district judge agreed with the

finding of an advisory jury that HAIR was obscene.
findings are important.

His

The judge expressly conceded that

taken as a whole, HAIR was not utterly without redeeming
social value, applying the pre-Miller standard.

But he

held that a play must be divided into three categories; first,
speech; second, symbolic speech; and third, conduct.

Under

the judge's view this last category "conduct” is not within
the freedom of speech protected by the Federal Constitution
and that category, "conduct", apparently includes virtually
all the nonverbal aspects of the play.
Then the judge focused on HAIR's conduct and he
concluded that it was obscene under State law.

The Sixth

Circuit affirmed over the dissenting opinion of Judge McCree.
Writing for the panel. Judge O'Sullivan expressly approved
the speech-conduct reasoning of the district court and in

7
MR. MONAGHAN:

That's the position he took, and

that's obviously the position which I intend to address
myself to at oral argument and have addressed myself to —
QUESTION: And that concept is different from an
obscenity concept, isn't it?
MR. MONAGHAN:

Well, the reason that the judge

refers to obscenity, his opinion in fact is quite confused
on this point.

In the district court he first finds by

making this dichotomy between speech and conduct, he finds
that the conduct is not affected by the free-speech guarantee
of the first amendment; it's
occurred on

a

no different from conduct which had

public street.

Now, from that analytical framework what he does is
he says, Does this conduct violate any State law?
finds two State laws which the conduct violates.
obscenity statute; the second is public nudity.

And he
One is an
And those

are the two State statutes he refers to.
But in order to do that he has to first make his
separation and to take a unitary production and divide it into
its constituent parts.
QUESTION:

And I gather on the

viewed-as-a-

whole element of the obscenity test, which I gather

still

survives —
MR. MONAGHAN:

It doesn't survive in his opinion.

It certainly survives Miller.

8

QUESTION;

It survives Miller.

You're going to argue

that, no, you can't break the play up this way.
MR. MONAGHAN;
QUESTION;

Right.

It's to be viewed as a whole and it has

to be viewed as a whole.
MR. MONAGHAN;
QUESTION;

That's right, your Honor.

Conduct, and everything else that may be

involved.
MR. MONAGHAN:
to two points.

I'm going to address myself essentially

One is the court was in error in considering

this to be an obscenity case to start with.
QUESTION:

That's al.l right as to the obscenity.

What about the p\iblic nudity aspect?
MR. MONAGHAN:

And with respect to public nudity,

I'm going to argue that that criteria standing alone would be
constitutionally insufficient under four decisions of this
Court squarely holding it, unless I seriously misread it.
QUESTION:
you as if

Mr. Monaghan, is this case the same for

Chattanooga had a city ordinance that it tried

to enforce against your showing the thing in a private theater
which it agreed to lease it to you?
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION;

No, it is not the same case.

Let me ask this, then, sir.

Could the

city of Chattanooga if it wanted to have an auditorium which
it said it was going to reserve for performances which were

9

suitable for the entire family, including minors?
MR. MONAGHANt

No.

That’s the first point.

My

answer to that, your Honor, is perhaps so, perhaps so.
not this case quite clearly.

That's

But, secondly, I have grave

doubts about that under the decision of this Court in Butler v.
Michigan.

You have to bear in mind — certainly, if there

is no alternative forum available.

Certainly if there is no

alternative forum available, which is often the case in the
Southwestern and Southeastern parts of the United States,
I don’t think it’s at all clear that you can reduce the
viewing status of the public to the level of children.
QUESTION;

But Butler was not a municipally owned

bookstore.
MR. MONAGHAN:

It was not a municipally owned

bookstore, but it certainly is very indicative in this case,
and it seems to me when you use a standard like something
which is suitable for ~ I would make three responses.

The

third response I would make is I am not sure that the standard
is impermissibly vague.

It invites an awful lot of content

discrimination on the basis of the criteria suitable for the
entire family.
QUESTION:

Well, then, your answer is in effect, no,

the city couldn't do what I -MR. MONAGHAN:
criteria used.

It could not,

if that were the

10

The first point 1 make in the brief
QUESTION:

—

Do you think the city could have an

ordinance forbidding minors or forbidding the producer to
permit minors to enter the showing of HAIR?
MR. MONAGHAN:

The showing of HAIR.

No# I do not,

because I think that even with respect to minors —
QUESTION:

Let's say under 16.

MR. MONAGHAN:

Under 16.

No, I do not, although

it is not necessary for me to defend that position here.
QUESTION:

What if the answer was that the city

could.
MR. MONAGHAN:

It wouldn't impair the strength of

this case.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it if the city said, well,

as Mr. Justice Behnquist asked, the city said, Well, we just
reserve our municipal facilities for events to which all the
people may come and all the families?
MR. MONAGHAN:

Because the standard — first of all

I would make several responses.

First, that was not the

standard that was used in this case.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. MONAGHAN:

The second response I would make is

that minors have constitutional rights to freedom of speech
also.

That's established in Tinker v. DesMoines.
QUESTION:

I know, but that answer then goes back

11
to saying that the city couldn't keep minors out of the
production of HAIR.
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

And then I said let's assume that it could.

MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

In my judgment —*

I'm sorry.

Let's assume it could.

Assume that it could.

MR. MONAGHAN:

Yes, your Honor.

Then that would

not, it seems to me, impair our case in any way.
QUESTION:

Well, that just goes to saying that the

city cannot reserve its auditorium for events to which all
the people may go.
MR. MONAGHAN:

I would think so, your Honor.

I

would take that position.
QUESTION:

If you are wrong on that, then you may

be in trouble.
MR. MONAGHAN:

I don't think I am in trouble in

this case because those aren^t the facts of this case.

And

I would say, your Honor, that it's important to understand
that's not a criterion, it seems to me that that standard
would invite an intolerable level of content discrimination.
I don't doubt for a second, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
that the city can formulate content-free standards, some of
which would exclude HAIR, if that were the only point.

For

example, it could take the position that we are not going to
let our auditorium be used for any Broadway production, but

12

only to encourage local theater enterprises
to the theater.

to gain access

But X do think that the free speech guarantee

of the first amendment is badly abused if vague and indefinite
standards can be used as a guide to engage in impermissible
content discrimination.
QUESTION:

What if the city of New YorJc owned the

Museum of Modern Art and they say we will open it to private
showings but it's limited to modern art, we are not going to
show exhibitors of Rembrandt and that sort of thing?

Is that

a permissible —
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:
discrimination?

I think it is.

Why, because it doesn't involve content

It does involve content discrimination.

MR. MONAGHAN:

It doesn't involve ~ it’s a question

of how much — it involves a line being drawn which one cannot
say aj priori will result in a lot of suppression of different
views, it seems to me.
like that.

I would be prepared to accept a line

I could argue that the line is invalid, it's

invalid content discrimination.

I happen to find that case

acceptable.
QUESTION:

But you are suppressing a tremendous

amount there a priori.

You are suppressing all art but modern

art.
MR. MONAGHAN:
suppression.

I think that the point is not

I think the point is the basis upon which the

13
decision is made.

And you do not want to permit municipal

officials to make decisions which involve a heavy amount of
content discrimination

because they do not like these

particular ideas being advocated.

And any criteria which

foster that, it seems to me is bad under the decisions of
this Court.

In fact, I know of no

case

to the contrary

in this Court.
QUESTION s

What if an art gallery, to pur sue Mr.

Justice Rehnquist's thesis a moment, what if an art gallery,
a public gallery, had a fixed rule that no living artist
could be exhibited.
MR. MONAGHAN:
Honor.

I think the rule is valid, your

I would vote to sustain it, because I don't see

built into that the perpetual suppression of ideas, nor do I
see that it works a —
QUESTIONS

Well, it suppresses contemporary expression,

does it not, contemporary artistic expression.
MR. MONAGHAN:
older proceedings also.

But those ideas may be reflected in
I think there is a big difference

or a substantial difference between both of those cases, both
lines of which I find acceptable.

And the criteria used

here which was simply the best interest of the city and
clear, culturally uplifting and healthful, I think under
those standards a great deal of content discrimination would
occur.

I would assume, for example, if the play Jesus Christ,

14
Superstar were turned down under these criteria, the
impermissibility of the standard would be plain.

You could

make an argument that Jesus Christ, Superstar is not clean,
healthful, and culturally uplifting because it involved
potentially an attack upon orthodox interpretations of
Christianity.

I think these standards are fatally defective.

Now, as I understand it —
QUESTION:

Are children allowed under your plan?

MR. MONAGHAN:

I would take the position that children

have to be allowed to see HAIR, but it's unclear from this
record what the situation was with respect to —
QUESTION:

Why do children have to see HAIR, be

permitted to see HAIR?
MR. MONAGHAN:

Why should they be permitted?

Because

it's not obscene with respect to children under the definitions
that were sustained in Ginsburg v. New York.

I have been to

several performances and I have seen a great many children
there.
QUESTION:

But you don’t take it that any play could

be shown?
MR, MONAGHAN:

I think there are some plays which

adults could see but children could not.
QUESTION:

That's what I wanted to get.

MR. MONAGHAN:

Yes, your Honor.

Now, as I understand --

15

QUESTION;

If you prevail here, you are going to

show
MR. MONAGHAN;
your Honor.

We certainly are going to show it,

We are certainly going to show it in Chattanooga.

Now, the response that’s made to essentially the
standards argument is a twofold one.

The first response is

that the respondents now take a position that it did not take
in the district court.

They take the position here that the

standards must be adequate for constitutional purposes, but
they assert that the standards are adequate.

But it's

interesting that the standards that they refer to are public
nudity and obscenity.
Now, I would suggest to the Court that those
standards are insufficient for two reasons.

First of all,

neither nudity nor obscenity was the criterion actually used.
There is only a single passing reference to nudity and there
is none whatsoever to obscenity.

Pages 16 and 17 of our brief,

we print the relevant testimony,

The criterion actually employe

was something quite different.
,Now, as to the single reference to nudity, not
only was it not used, if it were used, it would be a
constitutionally insufficient basis.

The decisions of this

Court, not one of which is discussed by ray brothers, are very
clear.

They are cited on page 30 of the brief, particularly

Jenkins v. Georgia, the recent obscenity opinion, California v.

16

LaRue, where this Court recognised that there is a great deal
of difference between nudity which occurs in a barroom or a
public street and nudity occurring in a play.

In my judgment

nudity relevant to a dramatic performance cannot constitute
a per se basis for prohibition, and it's far too late in the
day to argue otherwise.
How, we think that what we have said entitles us to
a judgment directing that the respondents make the Municipal
Auditorium available for the production of HAIR, but it's
possible that on remand this Court might conclude that the
respondents' use of improper standards does not now foreclose
them from using proper standards, such as obscenity.
Respondents' counsel certainly insists upon that position and
takes the position that he cannot enter into any kind of a
contract with respect to a "obscene" play, and the new
Tennessee obscenity legislation quoted in his brief would
support him.
So it would appear that the question of obscenity
is not avoided even if the Court agrees with petitioner that
the standards used were ultimately bad.

Since on remand the

respondents are going to press obscenity as the basis fordenying access to HAIR and the lower courts are going to
sustain that position, we therefore urge this Court to
address itself to the question of the appropriate standards,
not only to prevent a waste of resources and judicial economy,

17
but because of widespread public interest in resolving this
issue.

There are very few plays that can afford the expense

of litigation all the way to this Court.
QUESTION:

Do you, Mr. Monaghan, attack the

constitutional validity of the criminal law, or the Chattanooga
City Code, section 25-28 which makes it criminal for any
person in the city to appear in a public place in a state

of

nudity?
MR. MONAGHAN:

We attack it as applied, yes, we do.

Our position as stated in the brief, Mr. Justice Stewart, is
that the only criterion you can use with respect to a play
is obscenity, and if this — I guess you are raising two
points really.

Under State law we would think the statute

plainly inapplicable.
QUESTION:

We are not in a public street.
You are in a public place.

MR. MONAGHAN:
the statute.

We are not in a public place

If we are in a public place, then the statute

is bad as applied if it purports to dispense with any showing
of obscenity.

And the decisions of this Court already make

it clear, the decisions quoted in our brief on page 30 indicate
that nudity per se can't be treated as the equivalent of
obscenity, and we take the position here that no standard
other than obscenity can be used.
QUESTION:

What if one of the actors stole money

from another actor on the stage, would the larseny statute be

18

unconstitutional as applied?
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

Actually stole it?

Yes, actually stole it.

MR. MCNAGHAN:
that case, your Honor.

No.

And I think we can distinguish

I was going to address myself to that

question when I got to the issue of obscenity.
tinguishable for two reasons.

It's dis­

First of all, the actual stealing

of money has no communicative aspect to it.

It is not

expressive conduct, as I understand the meaning of the term.
And, secondly, if it were expressive conduct and therefore
aruably within the protection of the first amendment, there
would be a compelling State interest to justify the repression
of that conduct.
The position we take with respect to nudity is that if
it has dramatic significance, then the only basis upon which
it can be repressed is upon a showing of obscenity.
QUESTION:

In other words,

be nudefor purposes of
if they

the same people who might

the play and when the play itself —

went out in the street nude,

could be prosecuted under

this ordinance, but not for the nudity on the stage itself.
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

Precisely, your Honor,

Why wouldn't a person's choice to walk

around without any clothes on also be a first amendment right?
MR. MONAGHAN:
your Honor —

Because it has never been thought,

19

QUESTION;

Just like the kind of clothes, the kind

of necktie a person might wear if he chose to wear clothes»
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION;

That's right.

Or wore his hair long or short, why isn't

that protected by the first amendment under your view on the
public streets?
MR. MONAGHAN:

Because — there is no difference

between the clothes case and the non-clothes cases, as your
Honor points out, because it's never been treated to be
expressive conduct.
QUESTION:

Hair styles have been treated by many
\

courts to be expressive conduct.
MR. MONAGHAN:

Well, the circuit courts are evenly

divided on that.
QUESTION:

Yes, and it's been treated many, many

times repeatedly in many lawsuits,
MR. MONAGHAN:

By several courts of appeals, but

sometimes the case gets put on invasions of privacy, as the
First Circuit case did by Judge Coffin.
Maybe I ought to address myself directly to your
point right now.

I did have one other minor point to make,

and that is that this case is not rendered moot by the new
Tennessee obscenity legislation which was passed after the
writ of certiorari was granted in this Court, because in our
judgment the difficulty in the case is not with the

20

Tennessee statute, but with the interpretation to the
Constitution sustained by the lower Federal courts.

Put

differently, all the Tennessee statute does is that it
embodies the Miller criteria of what can be suppressed, and we
now have an authoritative ruling from the lower Federal court
tliat this can be suppressed under Miller.
QUESTION :

Can?

MR. MONAGHAN;

Can be.

Because the rehearing

petition en banc was denied.
QUESTION;

After our decision in Miller?

MR. MONAGHAN:

After your decision in Miller a

petition for rehearing filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit —
QUESTION:

In this case?

MR. MONAGHAN:

And the petition was denied. Yes, in

this case, your Honor.
QUESTION:

What was the presentation in that

petition ?
MR. MONAGHAN:

We argued Miller.

We argued among

other things that the decision was wrong and we argued that it
was even clearly wrong under' Miller and the petition was
denied, petition for rehearing en banc was denied, two judges
dissenting, and then the panel denied a rehearing.

So the

Sixth Circuit has expressed itself in the context of the
Miller case.

21
QUESTION;

What about the members of the audience

disrobing in the theater?
MR. MONAGHAN;

Not protected.

It has no dramatic

relevance and it's not expressive conduct.
QUESTION;

Aren’t there some plays in which part

of the play performance is audience participation?
MR. MONAGHAN;
QUESTION;

I've never seen any, at that level,

Aren't there ?

MR. MONAGHAN;

There may be.

And if there are ~-

QUESTION;

Hell's a-Poppin.

QUESTION;

That’s before your time.

(Laughter.)
QUESTION;

And before Justice Rehnquist’s time, too,

QUESTION;

That’s a very common thing, quite common

in the world of drama.
MR. MONAGHAN;
seen it.

It's beyond me.

I must say I haven’t

I would like to try and address the issue of •—
QUESTION;

What about it?

MR. MONAGHAN;

I would like to try to address that

issue which I think is at the core of Mr. Justice Stewart's
question.

And the way I would do it is as follows;

The

judge found that the play was obscene because he was able,
he thought, to separate a play into three parts ~ speech,
by which he meant no more than the dialogue; symbolic speech,
which he said was speech illustrative of the dialogue; and

22
conduct.

And now there is considerable confusion in that

categorisation, but if I understand him correctly, all the
nonverbal aspects of the play are conduct.

He set up this

dichotomy and then he began to hold HAIR1s conduct was obscene.
Now, put differently, the judge treats a play as
though it were little more than a combination of a book and
some conduct.

The book, that is to say the libretto was

protected speech under the first amendment, but the conduct is
not, it's wholly outside the area of the first amendment.
This permits the judge to view the conduct in isolation, he
doesn’t have to address himself to the dramatic relevance of
the conduct; he simply says this conduct, whether it occurs
on the stage or whether it occurs out in a public street is
the same conduct.

We concede nudity in the public street is

not protected.
QUESTION:

To take a more direct approach to the

case rather than arguing what you argue is to say, which I
assume you say, is that the conduct itself isn’t obscene.
MR. MONAGHAN:

That’s right, your Honor.

That’s

an evidentiary point we take the position that the conduct
itself is not obscene.

And in the last point of the brief

we argue that —
QUESTION:

I know your time is running, but may I

just ask, Do you think there can be a determination of
obscenity accepting your basic proposition unless you see the

23

play?
MR. MONAGHAN:

Do I think you can?

No.

I think

you can make a determination that it's not obscene without
seeing the play.
QUESTION:

None of these judges ever saw it* did

they?
MR. MONAGHAN:

None of the judges except Judge

McCree.
QUESTION:

Who voted dissent.

QUESTION:

Do you think any of the so-called conduct

in the play falls within the area of obscenity described in
the Miller and the Paris Adult cases?
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

Not hard core.

MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

I do not.

It is not hard-core pornography.

You think the courts were just wrong on

that score?
MR. MONAGHAN:

I think the basic error made was

the judge simply misunderstood the appropriate criteria and
it led him into all sorts of errors.

He equated conduct

which occurs in a theater that has dramatic relevance* which as I understand it* the classic form of expressive conduct
is a play.

This Court has struggled over and over with the

attempts at which conduct is going to be characterized by
speech and then brought into the protection of the first

24

amendment.

I put it to the Court that theater is the classic

form of expressive conduct, and it seems to me that there is no
QUESTION:

Can any theater presentation be obscene?

MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it can, your Honor.

How could it if —

MR. MONAGHAN:

If it doesn’t satisfy the criteria

set down in the Miller case.
The point that we're making is that you treat the
play as a unitary production first.

This doesn't mean that

what occurs in a play is beyond regulation.

A sufficiently

compelling governmental interest would permit regulation of
the conduct aspects of a play.
QUESTION:

Is there any difference between motion

pictures and plays?
MR. MONAGHAN:

I don’t think there's a great deal.

I mean, there is no reason to treat them as though they were
totally distinct.
But where the governmental interest is morality and
the State regulation focuses on either nudity or simulated sex,
it seems to us the obscenity criteria must be satisfied.
Now, I had expected to deal with the question of
whether or not I would be forced to take the position that
this means that actual sex has to take place on the stage.
Fortunately that’s not this case, and I don't find myself the
best

advocate for it, but I think that you can make principal

25
distinctions between actual and simulated, and all this case,
apart from its nudity, involves is simulated sex.
would suggest to the Court two differences.

And I

I am not sure

that they are sound in the end, but they seem to me to be very
significantly different.
First, there is no case in this Court so far as I
know which holds that nudity, I mean, actual sex is protected
expressive conduct under the first amendment.

It does seem to

me too late in the day to take the position that no simulated
sex is protected.

And at least the line becomes clear.

What

is actual sex is considerably clearer than what is simulated
sex, and once the concession is made that some simulated sex
is protected, it seems to me that —
QUESTION:

What’s this, simulated sex may be deemed

obscene?
MR. MONAGHAN:

Some simulated sex may be put down

if it gets to the stage of being hard core pornography.
QUESTION:
you said it.

It doesn’t really say it quite the way

Doesn’t it say that the State may proscribe

MR. MONAGHAN:

No, it does not, your Honor, because.

QUESTION:

That's a precise quotation from Miller.

MR. MONAGHAN:

What that does is say that this

kind of material can be denominated patently offensive, errotic

material.

But you are still left with the serious redeeming

social value test.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. MONAGHAN;

Where is that test now?
That test I think is alive and well.

It is specifically retained in your opinions.

And if that

weren't the case, it would seem to me that the first amendment
would be virtually wiped out in the area of nonverbal descrip­
tions of sex.

I think it's very important to make clear that

the serious social value test —

Of course, it's rephrased as serious

MR. MONAGHAN;

No, it's not utterly.

The last point I would say is that simulated sex is
necessarily expressive conduct.

It's hard to see that actual

everything which the actual sex would —
QUESTION;

As you correctly say, the theater is one

of tiie very first forums of expression.

But the common quality

of plays and/or moving pictures is basically that it is all

Yes, your Honor.

That's right, your Honor.

That’s the characteristic of plays anti

But this was not simulated nudity, this was —
MR. MONAGHAN;
QUESTION;

Actual nudity.

— actual nudity.

And it did run afoul —

you say it perhaps didn't because the theater wasn't a public
place.

But^putting that to one side and assuming the theater

was a public place, it directly violated an ordinance of the
city of Chattanooga, not having to do with obscenity as such,
but having to do with indecent exposure as it is called.
MR. MONAGHAN;

Well, it seems to me that the

response I would make is twofold.

You have accepted essentially

the argument we have made with respect to simulated sex, and
with respect to nudity, the only standard that can be used
is obscenity, the only standard that can be used —
QUESTION;

Then are you saying that this ordinance
»

is constitutionally invalid?
MR. MONAGHAN;

I am saying it is constitutionally

invalid in the context of a dramatic performance, and I would
cite to your Honor the case that is cited on page 30 of our
brief, four decisions of this Court.
QUESTION;

Why doesn’t the individual walking in

the street have as much right to make dramatic expression
as somebody on the stage?
MR. MONAGHAN!

Because it’s never been understood —

28

some line has to be drawn, some line derived from common sense,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, has to be applied with respect to the
point at which you are going to stop labeling conduct speech.
QUESTIONs

I agree with you.

MR. MONAGHAN:

And I would suggest to you that it

seems to me that the fact is that we have never treated
expressive conduct — we have never treated walking around nude
there is no decision from this Court which would suggest that
conduct like that is understood to communicate anything.
Whereas in a play it's different, it's a common, comprehensible
form of communication in the context of a dramatic performance.
QUESTION:

I think it was Mr. Campbell, wasn’t it,

who said performed in the street it might scare the horses.
MR. MONAGHAN:
QUESTION:

And a different State interest, yes.

How about Lady Godiva?

It didn’t scare

any horse.
MR. MONAGHAN:

I don't know that anybody understood

what she was doing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURDGER:

Mr. Nelson, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. NELSON ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NELSON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My brother started off by saying that the city

of Chattanooga has asserted essentially an unlimited right of

29

censorship.
this case.

We would say that this is simply not true in
The standard form lease which the petitioner

sought in the action specifically contains a clause which
says that all lessees must agree to abide by the laws of the
State of Tennessee, the United States, and the ordinances of
the city of Chattanooga.

One of those ordinances, as has been

pointed out, specifically prohibits public nudity.
prohibits obscene acts.

It

On top of that there is a Tennessee

common law criminal violation of indecent exposure or gross
lewdness, all of which are violated.
QUESTIONS

Did the petitioner refuse to sign this

contract?
MR. NELSON?

No, sir.

What happened before the

action was actually brought was never brought into the record
in this case, but there has never at any time been any
question but what this nudity would take place.
QUESTION;

In fact —

Not if he signed the contract, I suppose,

and you never gave him an opportunity to do it, did you?
MR. NELSON;

He was denied — his application was

denied at the time that it was made because
QUESTION?

(inaudible)»

Well, the show never took place in this

auditorium, so you don’t know, but you never gave them an
opportunity, youjust assumed in advance that he would break
his promise, is that it?
MR. NELSON;

Your Honor, it was stipulated in the

30

proceedings.
QUESTION?
MR. NELSON;
QUESTION;

Later lawsuit, wasn't it?
Yes, your Honor.
He stipulated that had he signed this

agreement, he would have violated it.
MR. NELSON;

It was stipulated that the some conduct

would occur in this play as has occurred in all the other
plays.

It was not denied by the petitioner at any time that

this public nudity took place.
QUESTION;
MR. NELSON;

It didn't take place in Chattanooga.
No, sir, but it would.

with that all down through the line.

They have agreed

This was never in issue

between parties.
QUESTION;

I don't see how you can rely on this

contractual language if you never gave him an opportunity to
sign the contract.

Had he signed it and violated the contract,

you would have had maybe a different kind of action.
MR. NELSON;

Then we get into, as you say, a

different kind of action.
QUESTION;

I thought Mr. Monaghan seemed to say

today that, yes, if this Court decided in his favor the play
would be put on in Chattanooga, and he made no reservation
with respect to its being put on in any different way from
what the stipulation suggested.
MR, NELSON;

That is correct, your Honor, and that

31
has been their position all along, Even in the preliminary
hearing which was held two days after the complaint was filedP
it was admitted by the petitioner before the desired dates
that public nudity would occur on the stage.

This has never

been an issue between the parties.
Now, at any rate, as I say, the lease form does
set forth the criteria which the auditorium board uses,
whether or not any ordinances or laws of the State of
Tennessee are violated.
As the judge found, the play opens •— and I would
beg the pardon of the Court to use some of the language as to
what happens in the play — with one of the main characters
coming out on stage throwing his trousers to the audience
and then leaping down into the audience and going down and
straddling a seat among the front rows in front of

a.

female

patron and looking down at her and shouting at the top of hi3
lungs, "I'll bet you're scared shitless."
Now, wa do get some audience participation, as your
Honors have found, or as the courts below have found.
Further, the question over here about the conduct
in Miller, whether or not the conduct in here would violate
the standards of Miller.
QUESTION:

Is it your view that that opening line

of the play that you just quoted violates any statute or
ordinance?

32

MR.. NELSONs

No, your Honor, that is not our view.

Our view is that the standards in Miller as well as the
obscenity law were violated in other portions of the play, but
there was a question about audience interaction and I was
directing it to that.
QUESTION s

I see.

MR. NELSON;

Now, the Court in its finding of fact

found on page 41 of the petition for certiorari,specifically
found that the overwhelmi ng evidence reflects that simulated
acts of anal intercourse, frontal intercourse,- liete.rosexual
intercourse, homosexual intercourse, and group intercourse
are committed throughout the play, often without any reference
to any dialogue- song, or story lying in the play.

At one

point the character Berger performs a full and complete
simulation of masturbation while using a red microphone placed
in his crotch to simulate his genitals.

Now, this falls

directly within the language of the Miller case.
My brother has taken the position that obscenity
must be tolerated if it is a part of the same vehicle whereby
first amendment rights are allegedly being exercised.

We would

respectfully submit that this position fails to recognise that
obscenity can manifest itself in conduct as well as in the
pictorial representation of conduct or in the written, or oral
description of conduct.

The district court herein and the

court of appeals both recognised this difference and applied it.

33

Subsequently to the district judges' finding in
this case and ruling, this Court in Kaplan v. California
also distinguished between the different forms of obscenity,
i.e. that could occur in conduct.
Now, I think we all must recognize that the
theatrical differs from other medium of entertainment, from
movies, from books.

It is differentiated by the fact that

live conduct does occur on the stage.

This is the whole

difference in the theatrical and other forms of entertainment.
QUESTION;

Generally simulated conduct, in other

words, it is human beings walking around and speaking.
MR. NELSON;
QUESTION;
conduct.

Yes, your Honor.
But the conduct is generally simulated

The murders are not real murders; the larsenies

are not real larsenies; that’s the whole —
MR. NELSON;
QUESTION;
MR. NELSON;

That is true, your Honor.
—quality of drama.
I think the difference here is that

when you look at the nature of the crime, we know that a
murder when simulated on the stage accomplishes no evil, but
when an obscene act occurs on stage, that act does accomplish
the evil against which the prohibition is aimed.
QUESTION;

Why is

.simulated acts of that kind any

worse than a simulated murder, which is a very serious offense
in every State in the Union?

34
MR. NELSON;
QUESTION;

I would go to the concurring —
Much more serious, much heavier penalties

for murder than there are for the conduct you are talking
about.
MR. NELSON;

I would refer your Honor to the opinion,

concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in the original
Roth case wherein he says that the State has a very real
interest in preventing repeated acts of sexual obscenity from
occurring, that over a period of time this can erode the
moral fabric of the society.

And, of course, if this is

permitted to go forward:, then this would be just one more
erosion, and it's the simulated act itself which is causing
this erosion.

It is a sexual act by itself.

QUESTION:

Why is this any more true of simulated

fornication or adultery, which are, in most States offenses,
but not nearly such serious offenses as murder, why is the
simulated act .of that kind any more demoralizing?

Wouldn't

it be less demoralizing than a simulated first degree murder
on the stage?
MR. NELSON:

I think if we had a simulated, fully

simulated act of adultery on the stage that it would embody
the same sexual conduct that we are talking about, and it
should be forbidden, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then Othello should be forbidden, shouldn't

it, because that was first degree murder.

35

MR. NELSON:

No, your Honor, because the murder is

not actually accomplished.
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

Nor is sexual, simulated.
A sexual act is not accomplished

in the terms as Judge Wilson put it of a pregnancy being
consummated or something of that nature, but a sexual act is
actually done on the stage where two actors or actresses
embrace each other in a copulation position, making all of
the thrusting movements that are generally associated therewith,
that is a sexual act.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Miller case say actual or

simulated?
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Doesn't that take it out of the Othello

strangulation?
MR. NELSON:

Yes, your Honor, it did, and our new

Tennessee statute which has been enacted and appended to our
brief —
QUESTION:

But you weren't applying Miller in this

case.
MR. NELSON:

That's correct, but I think we can look

at the fact that there is no reason to remand because the
same actswhich Miller later came along and defined were found
by the district judge in this case, and there would be no
prejudice whatsoever to the petitioners in this case.

36
QUESTION:

Even assuming — is it your argument,,

even assuming the case might have to be reversed under pre~
Miller and related cases, it doesn't have to be remanded because
of the intervening decision.
MR. NELSON:

That would be a secondary position.

First of all, we would take the position because this conduct
did occur, the public nudity, and so forth, it is directed at
conduct and not at more obscenity standards or any other
obscenity standards relating to first amendment freedom that
the case shouldn't be remanded at all.

It shouldn't even be

considered —
QUESTION:

In other words you are standing first on

the violation of the public nudity that Justice Stewart
alluded to earlier.
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

Yes,,your Honor, that is true.
Mr. Nelson, do you think your case is

any better by virtue of the fact that the petitioner sought
a least from a municipally owned theater than if it were
simply a question of him having obtained a lease in a private
theater and the city seeking to ban the production?
MR. NELSON:

Yes, your Honor, X do.

I think that

a municipality, particularly where they have done this by
regulation, has the duty to set an example for its
constituents, and certainly if we permit obscene acts to go
forward on public property, it tends to degrade the standards

37
that the municipality might apply to other institutions.
How, I think also that there may be a difference
where a municipality comes forward and actually arrests some­
body or confiscates some material.
anything of that nature.

Here they have not done

We have simply refused to enter

into what we consider an illegal contract which my brother
has already said maybe if your Honors find that the play
was obscene would be an illegal contract.
QUESTION:

Mr. Nelson, are there any other

theaters in Chattanooga?
MR. NELSON:

Yes, your Honor.

In the preliminary

hearing one of the questions which I addressed to Commissioner
Conrad,who is the Coramissioner of Public Utilities, Grounds,
and Buildings within the city, was directed specifically at
that and he testified that there were several other places
where it could have played on the private market.

Also, the

University of Tennessee at Chattanooga maintains an
auditorium or gymnasium where the play could have gone.
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

But that wouldn't be private, would it?
No, your Honor, but there were private

institutions which could have been rented.
QUESTION:

You mean private theaters?

MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And would a local license have been

required to show the —

38
MR. NELSON:
whatsoever,

No, your Honor, we have no licensing

We have no censorship ordinance in Tennessee.

QUESTION!

Under Tennessee lav; would the so-called

private theaters be considered public places for the purposes
of the statute?
MR. NELSON:

I believe so, your Honor, though I

could not cite you to a Supreme Court decision or anything of
that nature.

It would be my understanding that that would be —

QUESTION;

Public in the sense that anyone can get

in who has got $3 or $6 or $7, whatever the price is.
MR. NELSON:

That’s correct, your Honor.

to the general public.

It is open

It is not a private type of club.

Now, Judge Wilson in his original decision did not
find that the play as a whole was obscene.

This was simply

because he emphasised in his opinion because he did not find
the play to be "utterly without redeeming social value," it
was within the test.
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?
He didn't see the play.
No, your Honor, he did not see the play.
How could he find it to be obscene or

not obscene if he had never seen it?
MR. NELSON:

The method by which the case was brought

before the court was that the libretto was introduced, witnesses
were introduced who read the libretto, described the action
which occurred during the various scenes of the libretto.

I

39
think there were a total of eight different witnesses? some
six of whom had seen the play? and every witness who had
seen the play testified that the acts which Judge Wilson found
in his opinion and which I have alleged took place? did actually
take place.

There is no question but what those acts did

take place.
Also? I think? particularly with respect to public
nudity? Judge Wilson found that many of these acts occurred
outside of the scene or play line of the play.

For instance?

the act involving —
QUESTION:

That's pretty much up to the playwright

isn't it?
MR. NELSON:

Yes and no? your Honor.

I think in

some cases the playwright might know what he means —
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

Or the director or the actors.
But in this case the playwright didn't

even write the nude scene in.

It is not in the libretto.

It

is not in the script? and yet it occurs time after time after
time.

That is the point that they attempted to commercialize

the nudity in order to attract the people to See it.

And it

is this commercialized obscenity which gives the State one
of its primary reasons to enforce the public morality in this
case.
QUESTION:

Somewhere in one of the briefs there was

a reference to? or effort to describe the theme of the play.

40

As you recall, was that in your brief or Mr. Monaghan's?
MR. NELSONs

I think it was in Mr. Monaghan's brief

where he was attempting to categorise it, your Honor.
Now, we would respectfully submit that the O'Brien
case which your Honors have decided is in point in this case.
To our knowledge it has never been asserted that first
amendment freedoms permit nudity in public places and other
phases of sexual misconduct, much less require that responsible
>

public officials be mandated to allow them in the public's
auditorium.

In O'Brien, if your Honors will recall, a fellow

burned his draft card alleging that this was freedom of speech.
And this Court enunciated a four-part test which Judge Wilson
found applied to this particular play.

He found that the

State and local governments do have an interest under their
respective police powers to make regulations concerning public
morals.

He held, as did this Court later in the Paris Adult

Theater case that there is a long recognized legitimate State
interest involved, i.e., stemming the tide of commercialised
obscenity.

He further held that the city ordinance on public

nudity and obscene acts in the Tennessee common law or indecent
exposure are not regulations governing communication and are
unrelated to freedom of expression.

And he further found that

the incidental restriction was no greater than was essential
to the furtherance of the State interest.
In this regard I would point out that the city had

41
no other means available to keep illicit conduct from occurring
on stage.
Now, my brother has taken the position that before
a law involving the public morals can be relied upon, it must
meet obscenity standards.
this view.

We would respectfully dissent from

This is because such laws as laws directed at

morals are not directed at speech activities.

They are

therefore not within the ambit of the first amendment out of
which all of the standards for obscenity have emanated.

Thus

there can be no obscenity requirement.
The first amendment simply provides that Congress,
and through the fourteenth amendment the municipalities and
the States, shall make no laws abridging freedom of speech.
Now, the law governing public nudity is not a law governing
freedom of speech.

Public nudity is not speech? it is

conduct and subject to the police power of the State.
My brother has suggested that we must draw a line
somewhere, and I would suggest that that line be drawn when
you cross the line from speech to conduct, as we have here
done, rather than breaking it off on this type of conduct
as good and this type of conduct as bad.
QUESTIONS

Essentially you are arguing now that a

city or a State may prevent any performances in a private
theater if nudity is part of the performance?
MR. NELSON:

I think they may enact laws against

42

public nudity which we have.
QUESTION:

All right.

You say they may apply it to

a performance in any private theater.
MR. NELSON:

Yes, your Honor.

I don't think we

could go in without —* •
QUESTION:

What you are saying is that wouldn't b©

obscene under any definitions of obscenity, this nudity, but
you are saying public nudity gives the State or the city another
shot at prohibition.

You wouldn't suggest that this nudity

in a motion picture is obscene under the definition of —
MR. NELSON:

No, your Honor.

It has been specifically

found in Jenkins v. Georgia that it is not.
QUESTION:

That's right.

So wouldn't we have the

same rule in a private theater?
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
So that nudity on the stage in a private

theater is not obscene.
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

Is it or not?
No.

I mean, yes, it is, excuse me.

Well, why —
Because as we move from the screen to

the stage, we move from the depiction of conduct to the actual
conduct itself.
QUESTION:

So you are saying that nudity on the

stage in a private theater can be held — is obscene and may
be forbidden by a State law.

43

MS. NELSON;

I didn't say that it is obscene.

I

said that it is —
QUESTION;
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

But a State may prohibit it.
A State may prohibit it.
Because it is nudity.
Because it is public nudity.
And so it may not be obscene, it may not

be preventable as obscenity, but it is preventable as public
nudity.
MR. NELSON;

That's correct.

Just as you could

regulate a rape or something like this —
QUESTION:

Are you saying

Jenkins v, Georgia

might have been differently decided had Georgia — I've for­
gotten the city involved — had an ordinance such as you have
in Chattanooga?
MR. NELSON:

I think as we move from the stage to

the screen that the powers of the State are correspondingly
increased, because —
QUESTION:

Well, the act

didn't take place in

Jenkins v. Georgia, it didn1t take place in Georgia.

The act

took place in Hollywood, California.
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.
And there wasn't an offense, assuming

Georgia had the same law or ordinance, it didn't take place
within that jurisdiction.

9

MR. NELSON5
QUESTION:

44

That’s correct.
So if your ordinance in Chattanooga read

actual or simulated, then what?
MR. NELSON:

Well, the State lav; in Tennessee nottf

does read actual or simulated.
QUESTION:

So that then in Jenkins v. Georgia.

MR. NELSON:

How do you simulate movies?

When we

are speaking specifically in terms of nudity, it’s sort of like
being pregnant, either you are or you aren't.
QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

QUESTION:

Mr. Nelson, does Tennessee lav? proscribe

lewdness as well as nudity?
MR. NELSON:

Yes, your Honor.

I would refer you to

the case of Ryall v. State of Tennessee in our brief.
QUESTION:

Does the statute use the terra lewdness

in addition to nudity?
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

No.
Well, yes, 25-28 uses the word "lewd".
That's the city ordinance.

I think he

was —
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

It has to foe a lewd act.in a public place.
The city ordinance uses obscene, indecent,

or lewd act in a public place.
QUESTION:

You consider lewdness to be the precise

equivalent of nudity and vice versa?

45
MR. NELSON?

No, your Honor, particularly when you

are dealing with the screen.

I think that lewdness is a

broader category than would be nudity.
QUESTION:

Is exception made in the law for the

exhibition of nude in your public museums?
MR. NELSON:

No, your Honor.

We don’t find a person

on display in a museum.
QUESTION:

It doesn't apply to the portrayal of

a person.
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.
You think there may be a distinction

between lewdness and just plain simple nudity.
MR. NELSON:

I think lewdnass is a much broader

category.
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

Is there any Tennessee law on that point?
No, your Honor.

I would refer your Honor to the case of Ryall v.
State of Tennessee mentioned in our brief.
QUESTION:
MR. NELSON:

In your brief.
Which I didn't go into the facts in that

case, but the case involved a situation where a man called
a woman on the street and upon her turning and looking, he
exposed himself, just standing there and without making any
indecent expressions to her, much as occurred on the stage in
this play.

And the Tennessee Supreme Court in that case said

that upon exposure of one’s genitals, all that is necessary
is the intent to expose and not the intent to do so for an
immoral purpose and they affirmed the conviction, based on
gross indecency and lewdness.
QUESTIONS

Some of the criminal law in Tennessee is

common law, isn’t it?
MR. NELSON:

Yes, sir, this is common law in the

case that I am speaking of right now.
QUESTION;

Right.

QUESTION:

Would this case have been the same if

HAIR was not produced on the stage but shown in a movie?
MR. NELSON:

No, your Honor, because once again our

obscenity law — well, it might be now under the post-Miller
decision.

I don’t really know how far that will go as it

applies to the movies as opposed to stage plays.

But here we

have crossed the lines from literature and movies and so forth
into actual conduct which I believe your Honor referred to
in the Roth case.
QUESTION:

At the onset of your argument you referred

I think, to an opening scene, or at least an early scene in
the play where the man actually leaped off the stage and
performed certain acts.

Under Tennessee law would that conduct

come under the definition of lewd conduct?
MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I would believe so, your Honor.

Although once again I cannot cite you to a definitive decision

47
on that.

But coining down off the stage and wearing only briefs

with some beads hanging down in front of him a3 this man did
and standing, or seating himself facing a young lady and saying,
"I'll bet you're scared shitless," and then proceeding back
towards the stage using his beads to simulate his genitals
and going through what would amount to a masturbation I think
that under the post-Miller law that has been adopted, that
that could constitute lewdness under Tennessee law.
In conclusion —
QUESTION:

I take it it would follow from that that

if the same act were performed out in a local park in front
of the theater or across the street, that your answer would
be that that would be clearly subject to prosecution,
MR. NELSON:

It would be a simulated masturbation

which would be clearly subject to prosecution as indecent
or obscene act.
QUESTION:

With beads?

QUESTION:

Of the earlier act you described is what

we were referring to. You were describing the act that
occurred when he came off of the stage.

If performed outside

on the sidewalk in public you would say that would be lewd
under the Tennessee statute.
MR. NELSON:

The case has never been decided, but

it would be my opinion.
QUESTION:

What act are we talking about?

48
ME. NELSON ;

I would think that it would be as ho

was saying coming down off the stage —
QUESTION?

How can you come down off the stage when

you're on a public sidewalk?
MR. NELSON;

Going up and confronting a young lady

out in the public and spreading your legs wearing only a brief
pair of shorts and looking down at her and sayinge "1*11 bet
you're scared shitless."
QUESTION;
MR. NELSON;

And what would that violate?
I think that would constitute a lewd act,

your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. NELSON;

Would be what?
A lewd act, an act of gross indecency,

disrobing at least partially or all the way dcitfn to jockey
shorts or whatever you call them and confronting a young lady
in such a situation.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you. gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12 noon, the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.]
