MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 73-1888, United States against Alaska.
Mr. Randolph, you may proceed whenever you ara ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RANDOLPH;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court

of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The issue is whether a

disputed area in lower Cook Inlet in Alaska constitutes historic
inland waters, as the State claims, or constitutes areas of the
high sea3, as the United States maintains. .
The issue arose in the following context;
In March of 1967, the State of Alaska offered for
a competitive oil and gas lease sale 2500 acres of submerged
land in the portion of Cook Inlet in dispute.
The United States brought suit shortly thereafter in
the United States District Court for Alaska to quiet title
and for injunctive relief, arguing that the State had no
authority to lease submerged land in an area of the high seas.
QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph, at that point, does your

office have any knowledge of why they chose that route rather
than an original action here?
MR. RANDOLPH;

I inquired about that, Mr. Justice

Blackman,because I was not there at the time.

My understanding

is that;, without disclosing all the details, the idea was not
to burden this Court with what appeared to be at the time a
quite simple case»

Personally, I think that prediction was

not a very good one,and the case is now here.
Alaska claimed in response that Cook Inlet is
historic inland waters and therefore the State had titles to
'the submerged lands.
In the district court the parties compiled a record
and after an 8-day trial, the district aourt issued a
moMpiandum opinion holding for the State' of Alaska dismissing
the United States’ complaint.

The court instructed counsel for

the State of Alaska to prepare findings of fact, conclusionsof
law, which counsel did and the court subsequently signed.
The United States appealed.

On appeal the Court of

Ap^Qj&ls for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in a per curiam opinion.
The Court of Appeals subsequently stayed its mandate regarding
foreign fishing in the disputed areas of Cook Inlet on motion
of the United States, a matter which I will discuss Icifcer.
v -J .*v‘Xv4;. 1

That the case is here at all, that there is any
question whatsoever about the status of Cook Inlet is a function
of its size.

And for convenience I would like to refer the

Court to the map in the back of our brief.

I can’t emphasize

enough that this is a vast area, incredibly vast,

There is a

line, the Court will observe,at Kalgin Island to the north in
Cook Inlet, which I will develop later , which is the 3-mil©

5
closing line.

From that line down through the line going

across Cape Douglas, to the west, and Point Core, to the east,
as I said before, is a vast area of water.

One could easily

fit within that area all of the Chesapeake Bay, all of the
1

Delaware Bay, and all of the Long Island Sound.

In the area

above the line at Cook : inlet, one could fit another Delaware
Bay and another Long island Sound.
QUESTION:

Does the record give any square mile

figures for the areas you are talking about?
MR. RANDOLPH:

I have square mile areas that the

geographer of the State Department gave me after using maps
and overlays.

I could give them to the Court.

QUESTION:

Are they in the record?

MR. RANDOLPH:

They are not in the record, other than

by the maps, and these are material developed from the maps.
The disputed area constitutes approximately 5400 square miles.
The entire inlet is about 7400 square miles,

Delaware Bay

arid this is in the 1940 Bureau of the Census report -- Delaware
Bay is about 665 square miles; Chesapeake Bay 3200 square miles
Long Island Sound about 1300 square miles.
QUESTION:

How big i3 Lake Michigan?

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

I have absolutely no idea.

North and east of Kaigin Island, that's

a juridical bay, isn't it,concedediy?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

Yes.

6
QUESTION:

And I suppose there are-soma juridical

bays —
MR, RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

There are juridical bays within —

Kachemak Bay, for example.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

And Kamishak Bay are juridical

bays.
QUESTION:

Although, the headlands, there may be

more than Kamishak.
MR. RANDOLPH:

There is a map in the second volume

of the appendix, that is bound up in the volume, that clearly
indicates that’s the map

the United States distributed to

the» foreign countries in 1971.
The question here is whether within the disputed
area the State of Alaska owns the submerged land.

The State

entered the Union in 1959 on the same

as the

terms

other States, subject to the Submerged Lands Act, in which

the

Uhit^d States conferred title on the State three geographic
mi3.es from the seaward boundary of their inland waters.
>•;

'•

The question thus becomes whether this area constitutes
inland
waters.
r
'

And this Court in the California
case instructed
—'1
.........

that one must look to the Convention on Territorial Seas for
the definition of what conatitutes inland waters.
At this point I would like to pause, and I know the
Court is well aware of this, but in a summary fashion, th©
international law recognises a threefold division of the seas

7

inland waters or bodies of water that are partly within the
territory of a nation.
over those waters.

The nation has complete sovereignty

It can deny the right of entry to any

foreign vessel and has the right to exclude foreigners from
entering into those waters.
Moving out from the inland waters, one reaches the
territorial sea, which is a specified distance seaward of the
inland waters.

For the United States it is traditionally

three geographic miles.

The nation has complete sovereignty

over that area of the territorial sea, but it must allow
innocent passage of vessels through that.
Beyond the territorial sea lies the high seas where
normally a State may not exercise control.

However, in light

of the convention I have just mentioned, there is a contiguous
%

zone that runs along the territorial sea and in the high seas,
and for special purposes a nation may exercise control.
United States has dona that.

The

We have extended our exclusive

fishery jurisdiction out nine additional miles from the threemile territorial sea.
QUESTION s

Beginning where?

ME. RANDOLPH:

Beginning at the three-mile line.

It's 12 miles from shore, from the low mean water mark. And
that was done by statute and it is now the subject of negotiation,
I understand, in the Law of the Sea Conference.

75 miles long,

What I was wondering is what is the

QUESTION:

MP». RANDOLPHs
QUESTION:

Very approximately, 102 miles.

Now, the lease we are talking about, is

any of that within the territorial sea, or is it all outside?
MR. RANDOLPH:.

No.

It's all outside of the three-mile

line.
Under the Convention, there is no question whatsoever
that Cook Inlet is a bay.

The Convention, in Article 7, V

defines bays as well-marked indentations whose penetration is
such in proportion to the width of the coast that they contain
landlocked waters.

Cook Inlet meets that definition.

But under the Convention, just because a body of water
can be defined as a bay does not mean that it contains inland
waters.

The Conventions perscribes a geographic test for

determining whether a body of water is inland waters.

The

geographic test is whether the distance foetwqen the natural
headlands — and the natural headlands here, at least the
district court said, were 47 miles wide.
line is not shown on the map.

That is, that

It's from Cape Douglas to

Cape Elisabeth, which is approximately 47 miles.
So if we drew a line across the natural headlands
of Cook Inlet, one would not come to the conclusion that this
is a juridical bay, and you would have to use e* fallback line,
you would have to move a 24-mile line up into the and penetrate

10
the Alaskan coast until you reach Kalgin Island.

And at that

point you could draw a 24-mile line enclosing the maximum area
of water.
If one looked at only those provisions of the
Convention, on© would come to the conclusion obviously that
the area in dispute here dees not comprise inland waters.
However, the provisions of the Convention, in Article
which I have just referred, had as a last paragraphs

7,

to

'"The

foiegoing provisions do not apply to so-called historic bays."
The question, therefore, is although Cook Inlet does
not comprise a juridical bay in the area that we are talking
about, does it nevertheless comprise an historic bay?
In determining that question, which is one of
..w .

.

international law, this Court has looked to a comprehensive
United Nations study entitled "The Juridical Regime of Historic
Waters.”

Three broad fastor3, have to be taken into account in

determining whether an area is historic waters, historic
inland waterss

One, the exercise of authority by the claiming

nation.? two, the continuity of that exercise, whether it's
been done for a considerable length of time; and three, the
attitude of other nations,acquiescence by other nations in the
exercise.
The question becomes somewhat unreal before this
Court, though, because what we are talking about is really a
domestic dispute, and it’s difficult to talk about the attitude

11
of other nations and claims being opposed when it is really an
internal dispute within the United .States between a State and
the Federal Government.

And therefore this court has instructed

that in looking at these questions, one must treat thorn as if
made by the national sovereign and opposed by other nations.
In that sense this Court approaches the problem as if it were
an international tribunal adjudicating a claim asserted by the
United States and opposed by other countries, interested
countries, in the world.
In that light it's quite important to observe that
the longstanding United States foreign policy has been to
limit national claims, territorial claims in the oceans of the
world, whether made by expanding inland waters or by extending
the territorial sea, or in any other matter.
QUESTION:

We have been pretty aggressive in claims

to the Outer Continental Shelf, have we not?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, but the Outer Continental Shelf

is not an exercise of territorial jurisdiction so as to
exclude ships, for example.

We may mine there.

And we are

in the process, Mr. Justice Stewart, of course, in the Law of
the Sea Conference that is now going on of negotiating.
QUESTION:

I know that.

And our claims are quite

extreme.
.

MR. RANDOLPH:

We think that the definition of

international boundaries that the United States has traditionally

12
asserted weighs heavily against Alaska6s assertion that in
the past certain actions or inactions of the United States gave
rise to historic title.

The other nations of the world are

aware of our foreign policy in regard to jurisdictional
boundaries, and only the most clear, direct, and longstanding
action by the United States would alert them to a change of
our normal posture attitude.
We think there is no such evidence here, and 1 would
like to discuss in sequence three different incidents or groups
of incidents on which the district court relied, we think, do
not give rise to historic title.
First, there is the Shelikof Strait incident.
Second, I will discuss in general fisheries regulations
And third of all, the Gharrett-Scudder line„
I might add that nearly everything in this case
involving a claim or an assertion, .or whatever, that was-relied
upon to establish sovereignty, involves in some way or another
fishing regulations.

There are some dealing in the 13th

century with sea otters, but nevertheless, in the 20th century,
they are mostly all fishing regulations.

QUESTION s

Xu spite of the claims by the Csar.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, which were quickly retracted upon

protest by the United States and Great Britain.
QUESTION:

You are not going to deal with that at all?

MR. RANDOLPH:

I am not.

The district court, I

don't believe, relied upon it, and I don't believe counsel for
the other side has either.
QUESTION s

Why do you stress the fact they were only

disputes about fishing?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, I would like to get to that.

That's exactly what I am going to deal with.
In the Shelikof Strait incident, I think I can deal with it
without talking in terms of fishing, but in fact it was a fishing
incident.

The district court termed this the clearest assertion

of sovereignty, and I take it the clearest assertion that
historic title had ripened as a result of this Incident.

It

took place in April of 1962 when six Japanese ships arrived
off of the Kodiak Island fishing grounds to search for schools
of herring.

Alaska knew ahead of time that the Japanese ships

were coming.

Indeed, the Governor of Alaska in March of 1962

wrote to Undersecretary of State George Ball, advising him of
the entry into the area of the Japanese fishing vessels and
/

asserting that Alaska was going to take action if they entered
Alaskan waters, and got no response.

The fishing vessels went around Kalgin Island in
a clockwise direction, the Japanese fishing vessels, once and
caught no fish.

Department.

He telegraromad again

to the State

The State Department sent a representative, a

Mr. Yingling, to the Governor's office in Juneau, and Mr,
Singling advised the Governor that if they entered Cook Inlet
there was nothing he could do about it because on an initial
reading Cook Inlet comprised high seas.
The fishermen went into Cook Inlet on April 5th.
They went around the Barren Islands and then down to the
Shelikof Strait.
QUESTION s

Where are the Barren Islands?

ME. RANDOLPH:

The Barren Islands lie right in the

middle of Cook Inlet, of the line.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, I have it.

MR. RANDOLPHS

They went around the Barren Islands,

and the nest day sailed down into the Shelikof Strait.

Ten

IfeyS "-later, 75 miles from the nearest entrance point to Cook
Inlet, they were seized and arrested by Alaskan fishing
authorities.

The captains of the three vessels were held and

subsequently signed four days later an agreement stating —

•

and this is set out in the appendix on pages 1186 to 1188 —
that they would not fish in the Shelikof Strait until "final
determination Jay a court regarding whether the Shelikof Strait

15
and adjacent waters are international waters.1'
There is no mention in the agreement that these
fishermen signed as to Cook Inlet.

Nevertheless, on May 3rd?

Japan protested the seizure of these fishing vessels.

fished before.

Japan

The Shelikof Strait has been

Indeed we have evidence that Japanese trawlers

fished there in 1961.

tod although we understand that the

questions to be resolved by a court? we consider this a
unilateral assertion of sovereignty that we will not find
binding.
The United States replied to the Japanese' note of
protest on June 19th saying that this was a matter to be
decided by the court.

The United States pointed out that it was

not clear whether all of the vessels that were seised were
within three miles from the shore of Shelikof Strait? in which
case, if they were within the three-mile limit, they were in
territorial seas, and maybe the seizure was proper at that
time.

But in any event the United States in response to

the protest said it is not clear to us whether they were in
the high seas or in the territorial seas, and we will leave
that to a court' to adjudicate.

The court never did adjudicate?

the actions against the Japanese were subsequently dismissed.
The next significant event, I suppose, in this sequence
is that in January of 1963 at a breakfast at the White House
where a number of Governors of Western States were present, plus

16
Attorney General Robert Kennedy mid the President John F.
Kennedy, as an aside, the President of the United States said
to the Governor of Alaska, "yon did the right thing."
This the district court found to foe a clear assertion
of sovereignty over Cook Inlet.
law for a number of reasons.

We think that's a mistake of

Number one, obviously, the

seizure didn't take place in Cook Inlet.

It's like arresting

a ship up Cape Hatteras as an assertion of sovereignty over
Chesapeake Bay.
QUESTION?

Doesn't international law recognize the

doctrine of hot pursuit?
MR. RANDOLPH:

These ships were tracked from the time

that they entered Alaskan waters until the time that they left.
That, was ten days later that they were seised in Shelikof
Strait.

I don't think there is any evidence in the record

that says that Alaska could not have seised them sooner.

They

had gone through the Shelikof Strait already once.
QUESTION*

The statement you quoted as an aside, do

you suggest that refers to what the Governor did in bringing
the suit or in dismissing the suit?
MR* RANDOLPHS

The record is totally unclear on that.

It's page 281 of the appendix.
QUESTION*

Did the district judge undertake to sort

that out?
MR. RANDOLPH*

He made a finding of fact.

The

17
finding of fact is, 1 belie've —- no, I don’t have it»
of the first appendix is where this was stated»

Page 218

He said the

Governor was told by the President that he did the right thing
in seizing the vessels.
That's not what the Governor's testimony w&a but we
will accept that.

We are not challenging the findings of fact.

Even accepting that it’s not clear that the vessels were — where
they were, whether they were in territorial sea or within the
high seas.
More than that, we don't even think this was a clear
assertion of sovereignty of the Shelikof Strait, let alone
Cook Inlet 75 miles away because of the fact that it has naver
really been determined exactly where these vessels were,
whether they were in the high sea otherwise known as the
high sea area.
Second of all, and more important, I suppose, is
that tills could hardly be considered an incident to give rise
to historic title.

On© of the requirements is that other

nations acquiesce an assertion of sovereignty.

So even if

this were a clear assertion, which we do not think it is,
even if this were an assertion of sovereignty of Cook Inlet,
nevertheless, it is met by an immediate response of protest
by the Japanese Government.
On top of that, in regard to the Shelikof Strait
itself, since 1962 tbs evidence in the record is that Russian

18
trawlers have been in the strait.

,

I cite appendix 206.
•

Japanese ships have navigated through the strait? appendix 232.
And Canadians regularly fish for halibut there«
QUESTION:

The strait is not in issue here, is it?

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

No, it5s not.

And the question —

I thought it was rather clear, at least

for purposes of this case, that three miles out from Kodiak
Island and from the mainland of Alaska, of course, is territorial
sea in the Shelikof Strait, but otherwise the waters of the
Shelikof Strait are international waters.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Alaska asserts sovereignty of them,

at least that is the intent of their seizure of the Japanese
vessels.
QUESTION:

But that's not — the waters of the

Shelikof Strait axe not at all in issue in this case.
MR. RANDOLPH:

That’s precisely my position, Mr,

Stewart.
,-.h'

QUESTION:

That*3 the point of my question, too.

MR. RANDOLPHS

The point is that the district court

said this was the clearest in the entire record, this was the
clearest assertion of sovereignty over Cook Inlet, this
particular incident that I have referred to.
Now, beyond that, there are other existing regulations
that are involved in this case that apply to the Cook Inlet
area from the years 1906 until Alaska became a State,

The one

19
important factor that I would like to bring out about them is
thatnot a single time in the entire history of this inlet, the
disputed portion of this inlet, was a foreign vessel or foreign
national ever arrested — ever.

Not one.

Now, it could be,

one could say that nevertheless there could be an assertion of
sovereignty because Cook Inlet was so well recognized, so well
respected by the other nations of the world that no nation
dared enter, no nation dared put its ships into Cook Inlet
without seeking specific permission.
That's not the case in regard to Cook Inlet, because
the fact of the matter is that there has been foreign fishing
by Canadians for halibut within the inlet.

It's documented

in the record, from 1943 through to 1970.
Now, I would like to refer the Court to one finding
in the district court's opinion, because we don't dispute it,
but I think it’s rather misleading.
44a

It's Finding 101 on page

of the appendix —I'm sorry, petition for certiorari.

Finding 101 says that the fishing for halibut by Canadians was

de-minimls because there were possibly only two undetected
instances before Alaskan statehood in 1959, and after that —
*

-

••

’*

-

'

careful with the language — only five Canadian vessels had
fished for halibut in Cook Inlet.
That's absolutely correct.

What the court has not

mentioned is it happened on 20 different occasions for a total
of 115 days

20
Nevertheless, the point of the court's holding in
this regard that on© can disregard the entry of Canadian vessels
into Cook Inlet because of their infrequency is in our view a
direct contradiction of international law.

The juridical

Kagime that the court has referred to points out that it may be
that no action is necessary, but whenever any action is
riecerjsary in order to assert sovereignty over a particular
area, that action must be taken or historic title cannot
ripen*

Bo therefore,

Alaska's, or the United States'when

the United States had this territory,

failure to take any

action against the Canadian vessels, vm think, stops, prevents
historic title from ripening.
i .'

Now, the district court pointed out nevertheless there
Were a great many instances of action against Americans,
United States citizens that were fishing in Cook Inlet.

Let

me point out that throughout the entire findings of fact in the
district court's opinion, in the 20th century the district
court documented six arrests of American citizens prior to
statehood within the disputed area of the inlet, just six.
j££:£&r statehood, on one day, July 6, 1970, the district court
documented two arrests of United States citizens.
There is some testimony in the record, and we think
this district court could not rely upon this, of officials who
at various times petroled Cook Inlet, who were asked, MWha,t
would you have dona had you seen a foreign vessel?"

They

21
testified,

Weil, we would have seised it or we would have

done this or that.

The district court, we think, improperly

relied upon that testimony.

The requirement of international

law is that an assertion of sovereignty be open and notorious.
It has to give other countries of the world an opportunity to
respond.

The inner intentions of officials who patrol cook

Inlet, we do not think, rises to that kind of open, notorious
action, and the district court improperly relied upon it.
As far a3 fishing was concerned in general, the fact
that the United States regulates fishing of its own citizens,
even cm the high seas, is of no consequence whatsoever to
determining whether international sovereignty, sovereignty
as over inland waters, has been asserted over a, particular
area.

The United States can exercise sovereignty — or

exercise authority over its own United States citisens regardless
of whether they are in the territorial sea, the contiguous
zone, or even on the high seas itself.

The fact that in the

United States citizens, six of them,

the district court, quite important.

To

We think that was clear

error.
The court also relied.upon various other particular
actions?

The Alien Fishing Act, which was passed in 1906.

sovereignty.

Before I leave this point*. I think the most important
one of the most important facts is that in 195l and again
in 1953* before Alaska became a State* there was a controversy*
a Question* developed within the Bureau of Fish and Wildlife
that was patrolling the area, about whether they could arrest
a foreign vessel within the middle of Cook Inlet.

They said —

Director Day* the International Director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service, determined and instructed the people in
Alaska that they could not because the middle of Cook Inlet
was high seas.

Again* I think that undercuts any idea that this

is a claim of sovereignty and it was error for the district
court to rely upon these facts which occurred but nevertheless

assertions of sovereignty over all of Cook Inlet were the r
Gharrett-Scuddef maps.

Curiously* i?l the memorandum opinion of

the district court there is not a word about the GharrettScud&er maps.

They are mentioned in the findings of fact, but

in the opinion which sets forth the reasons why the district
court reached its result* there is not a word about the Gharrett.

23
Scudder maps.

The facts of the maps, which are reproduced as

two maps 8502 in the supplemental material hare, they were
transmitted to Canada for the purpose of fisheries management.
The idea was that Canada wanted to see where the high seas
area would be, where the United States would prevent net
fishing of salmon by its own United States citizens.

The maps,

'

if the Court looks at them, were drawn with straight lines.
The United States does not use straight lines to

MR. RANDOLPH:

8502.

{

The United States does not

use straight base lines, but uses sinuosities that follow
the coast line, draws undulations.
On top of that, Canada could hardly have conceived
this as an assertion of sovereignty if it looked at the straight

...

base lines, which would be a sudden departure.

The maps

ware drawn by two Department of the Interior employees, which
makes it suspect immediately.

How could that be?

One would

suspect that the geologist of the State Department would set
the international boundaries.
But beyond that, they are not even straight base
lines in conformity with the Convention because the
Convention requires for straight base lines, the lines touch

24
land

each time a straight line is drawn.

If yon look at this

map, you will find islands that are ringed by square lines.
So it doesn't even conform to that.
In point of fact, the district court relied upon this.
We think it was a mistake.

I won't mention the disclaimers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. PHILLIPS ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PHILLIPS?
tiie Court?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

In the short tirae that I presume to take this

morhin’g, I would like to ask the Court, or invite the Court's
attention to two points, two issues?
'

The first issue may be fairly stated, I think, in

this"'"‘inquiry s

Has there been an expressed or explicit claim

6T jurisdiction over Cook Inlet?

If so — and Alaska claims

it’is so' — then the two following elements, we think, fall
e'asiiy into patterns of continuity of the assertion, the
■

.ii,•

.

.•

’acqui©scence of foreign nations.
In 1924 Congress enacted what is popularly known as
r. Vcf.

,‘€laig1bWiit© Act.

.

'

The purpose of the White Act was to protect

£he‘; fisheries of Alaska.

The Act authorized the Secretary of

Commerce, in subsequent years the Secretary of the Interior,
and I quote, "to set apart and reserve fishing areas in any of

25
the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction."
These are the key words "any of the waters over which the
United States has jurisdiction."

These wojcds .set the stage

for what thereafter the executive department of the government
was to do.

Was it to SQt apart Cook Inlet as waters over

which the United States claimed jurisdiction?

Was it to

set aside only a part of the waters, for example, three miles
from the coastline?

What did the executive branch do?

It set apart 12 fishing areas, geographically, by
name, by definition.

In the arrival of those 12 areas, the

Secretary was careful to limit the jurisdiction claimed by.
•' --i

-

the use of the words "territorial coastal waters."

It might

be helpful to the Court to look at just how this was done.
Page 1171 of Volume II of the Appendix,look

at the definition,

for example,. I am selecting this at random, of Bristol Bay.
The Bristol Bay area is hereby defined to include all
territorial coastal and tributary waters of Alaska from Cape
Newenham, et cetera.
Look at the definition of the Kodiak area.

The Kodiak

area is hereby defined to include the waters of the mainland
shore extending, and so on, smd the territorial coastal and
tributary waters of Alaska.
Now, traditionally, and the Solicitor has argued
this both here this morning and in his brief, and we don9t
dispute it, the United States has limited its claim of

2S
territorial sea to the breadth of -three miles.

What then, is

the significance of the use of this language# "territory
coastal waters"?

Secretary of Interior Udall in a letter

dated April 20# 1962# to the Secretary of State explained the
significance of these waters# and he said that the use of the
territorial coastal waters indicated an intent to limit the
claim of sovereignty in those districts to three miles.
That8s in line with the traditional assertion of three miles
for territorial sea.
I have said this was done in eleven of the districts.

Notice the absence of words "territorial coastal

In talking about territorial coastal waters# Secretary

Udall# and properly so# said -the use of that language# and I am
quoting# "negates any assertion of jurisdiction over the entire

Government has never answered this argument# that if today the
Federal Government, who was the author of that definition, was
given the chore of assarging jurisdiction over all of Cook
Inlet# he could not have chosen clearer or more precise words or

QUESTION?

What did you say this document was, Mr..

Phillips?
MR. PHILLIPS:

This, Mr. Justice Brennan, is the

regulations put out each year for 33 years by, first, the
Department of Commerce, the Secretary of Commerce, and then in
later years the Secretary of Interior, defining, as the
Act required him to do, to set apart certain areas.
In the lower court the Government’s chief witness,
a man named Howard Baltzo, who had testified that he had some
experience and expertise in drafting these definitions.

We

asked him if he could draft one so far as Cook Inlet was
concerned that could use words that would more clearly assert
jurisdiction than the language I have read to you, and of
course he said he could not.
Now, why, the Court may ask, was Cook Inlet singled
out?

It's not an accident, because it was done year after

year after year for 33 years from 1924 to 1957.
are three reasons, and they are undisputed:
judicial precedent for this.

Why?

There

First, there was

In 1392 a Federal district court,

sitting in Alaska, had held that no part of the waters of Cook
Inlet were international waters.
Secondly, Cook Inlet, unlike any other of the submerged
land cases that this Court has considered, though it be a large
body of water, is uniquely surrounded by the lands of Alaska.

28
If the Court please, here, as 1 point, is Cook Inlet»

Whan you

look at the whole map of Alaska as it is depicted here, you
see this area that I am pointing to, Cook Inlet, although
surrounded by the lands of Alaska, and this geographic fact,
undisputed, was of significance to the district court in the
Kodiac decision in 1892 and it was dealt with at length by the
lower court in this case.
A third reason why Cook Inlet was singled out, the
evidence is undisputed and the lower court found in its findings
of fact that from the very beginning all of the waters of Cook
Inlet have been vital to the interest of the inhabitants of
the shores of Cook Inlet.
QUESTION;

What you are telling us about the effect

of the White Act is certainly strongly controverted by the
Secretary entrusted with its enforcement, that is, then
Secretary UdalX, back in Apfil of 1962 who says, thes© regulations
were hot intended to enlarge or extend the territorial waters
of Alaska in a legal or jurisdictional sense*
that they

He also says

were enforced only in three years — '57, '58, ’59,

and never enforced against any foreign nationals.
MR. PHILLIPS;

I know, you are looking at page 831

of the record.
QUESTION;

Yes, the letter of April 20th, page 831.

MR. PHILLIPS;

Now, in the first place, you will

notice that he is not talking about Cook Inlet, and he is

29

stressing, as I pointed out a moment ago, the use of the
words "territorial coastal waters."

Now, if it9s fair for him

to say these words limit jurisdiction, and it is fair for him
to say it, it's fair for us to say when those words are not
put in the definition of Cook Inlet, but the words are "all the
waters”, then I think Secretary Udall’s reasoning reinforces
the claim, Mr. Justice Stewart, that Alaska

makes here.

At

Xea3t that is our argument.
QUESTION:

It is true, is it not, that the V7hite Act

was not ever enforced against non-Americans?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Enforced in thi3 sense, and vre claim

this is enforcement, that there were — it was distributed
throughout the world.

It was the basis upon which repeated

arrests had been made of American citizens.

The lower court

found these patrols were open and notorious, and that any
foreign nation would have been put on notice —
QUESTION:

It had to do with netting salmon, didn’t

it?
MR. PHILLIPS:
QUESTION:

Sir?

Didn’t it have primarily to do with

netting of salmon?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Salmon was the important

fishery.
The third reason that Cook Inlet was singled out
was that which the trial court found, and based on undisputed

30
evidence, as far as vie are concerned, not accepted by the
Federal Government, is that if this fishing had not bean
controlled for the benefit of the American people, those fishing
areas would have been destroyed to the economic disaster of
the people of America and the citizens and residents of Alaska,

same language, it’s logical that the trial court found that
Cook Inlet was a.historic inland bay.

about, the claim that all Alaska has done has been to grove
that this is a historic territorial sea rather than a historic

you-»
MR. PHILLIPS$

The juridical Regime points out that

a State which forbids foreign ships to fish therein

31
indisputsd ly demonstrates by such action its desire to act as
a sovereign.

Of course, where a nation's laws have been so

clearly stated, as a Judicial «Regime also recognises, the
foreign nations can recognize those laws and not come in, and
in that even, of course, there is no occasion to enforce the
law, and the findings bear on that.
Let me legally address that argument, however, the
argument that we have shown only a territorial sea.

The

Juridical Regime states that the dominant opinion is that when
you talk about historic bays, you are talking about inland
waters.
Zone ,

The Convention on Territorial Sea and Contiguous
Article 7,

permits a line to be drawn between

the entrance points of a bay where the entrance points are not
further than 24 miles apart.

That line encloses inland waters.

Section 6 excepts historic bays from that 24-mile restriction.
So that if you draw .a line across the entrance points on the
exception of historic bays, that line necessarily encloses
inland waters.
Thank you.
MR. CHIBS’ JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Cranston.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHARLES K. CRANSTON ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. CRANSTON;
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This Court in the second Louisiana case indicated

32
that historic bay cases such as these raise principally factual
issuesf and that since the doctrine of historic bays is
somewhat imprecise, it is to the tryer of fact to 'which this
Court leaves the initial determination.

Therefore, the

evidence as to what constitutes a historic bay is in Alaska’s
opinion extremely important and is the claim upon which this
case will actually turn.

“■'jt.

Therefore, I would like to comment briefly on the
evidence.

As this Court is aware, and as there is no dispute,

there are three criteria evidentiarywise upon which a bay
status is characterized as historic.

That is to say, the

exercise of sovereignty over considerable period of time with
the acquiescence of foreign nations.
With respect to sovereignty, the striking fact of
this case is that witness after witness, without objection by
the t/nited States -“incidentally, relative to this petition
for writ of certiorari, no objection was made as to the
introduction of any of this evidence in the petition.

Witness

after witness testified to continual patrols, continual
arrests, continual boardings of vessels, and continual vessel
arrests from the year, to begin with the Kodiak case, 1892,
up to 1971, and the boardings and patrols were testified fed
by the principal witness of the United States, Mr. Howard
Baltzo, as being a very significant act of enforcement.
And what was the enforcement to do?

Principally

33

two things:

One* witness after witness, uncontradicted, and

the court so found, testified that Cook Inlet, frost the line
drawn by the court, that is to say Point Gore, Barren Islands,
Cape Douglas, was patrolled for the purpose of enforcing the
Alien Fishing Act, an act which specifically prohibited aliens
from fishing in waters of Alaska under the jurisdiction of the
United States.
The United States tends to disregard this evidence
and say that the definition of "waters of Alaska" was unclear
in the Alien Fishing Act.

It is important to recognize that

the act was passed only six years after the Kodiak decision
of which Congress must have been presumably aware, which
defined all of Cook Inlet as inlands waters of the United States,
not international waters.

That definition was incorporated

into the Alien Fishing Act and enforced by agents and patrol
officers of the United States.

It is important that testimony

on this point is clear and uncontradicted, and the lower court
found this to be so.
Secondly, as to continuity, two expert witnesses
called by the State of Alaska testified that based upon their
historic research, again uncontradicted, and found by the
lower court, that the usage or that the activities by the
United States over all of Cook Inlet were such as to have
developed into usage.

This is the criteria specifically set

forth by the legal document which no one to this date has

34
objected to and all agree is the criteria by which historic bay
status is achieved, that is, the jurisdiction of the United
States had established a usage over all of Cook Inlet.

Two

expert witnesses in the field of history again Alaska complied
with what this Court has set to be the evidentiary standard: in
cases of this sort, that is, they are principally factual cases
left to the discretion of the tryer of fact to determine. Based
upon undisputed evidence, the tryer of fact in this case found
that the sovereignty of the United States had been exercised,
had developed into usage over all of Cook Inlet for a considerable
period of time.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of this case is
the third requirement, and that is the requirement of
acquiescence.

First, I would like to deal, since it was dealt

at length in the Solicitor's argument, with the Shelikof Strait

case? both in the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and now

significance of this incident with respect to Cook Inlet.

need only .refer to the Japanese note of protest, which appears
at page 3A of the Appendix to the United States brief.

Fisheries company to the Alaska State authorities to abstain
from operations in the Shelikof Strait and the Cook Inlet was

MR. CRANSTON:

The arrest of the ships was

However, more significant are the actions of

Japan and the United States subsequent to the arrest.

Faced

With the agreement not to fish in waters of Cook Inlet, what
did the Japanese do?

The Japanese did, it is true, and the

record is undisputed, enter a protest.

However, in response

to this protest, the United States never at any time recognised
dir admitted to Japan or proclaimed to Japan that the waters
involved, to wit, Shelikof Strait, and Cook Inlet,were
international waters.

In fact, it said this is a question

which is more properly left to the decision of a court.

And

36
this was dons *— tills response, incidentally, was done
contrary to the advice of Mr. Yingling who was then the
responsible attorney in these matters in the Department of
State.

That is what the United Statas did.

, .

But. even more significant is what did the Japanese
do?
1

From that time, the Japanese have not fished in Cook

Inlet —
QUESTION:
...

The problem with this Japanese seizure

was it was not in Cook Inlet, but was in Shelikof Strait,

and that's all spelled out in Japan's protest, and any reference
to Cook Inlet is equivalent or analogous to what we call
casual dicta in the Court opinion, it seems to me, it had to
do with the seizure in Shelikof Strait which is not in issue
here in this case at all.

That’s what the protest was about.

MR. CRANSTON:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice

And that is the agreement which was referred to and complained

QUESTION’S

Don't you think there might be some

question about the status of a note secured under, an agreement,
as you caXX it, from the crew of a small fishing vessel under
those circumstances?

Might you not have some Miranda problems

and a few others like it?
MR. CRANSTON s

Aside from the fact that we are

dealing in what is essentially a civil case, Mr. Chief Justice,
I would not rely on the agreement as acquiescence by the
Japanese.

We do rely on the response of the Japanese Government

after the agreement was entered into and after the protest
was made, that being the fact that, in face of continuing
State of Alaska jurisdiction over Cook Inlet, as expressed
through its regulations, which the testimony again unconteatedly
points out, was disseminated to Japan, that is, regulations
which state all of Cook Inlet within the line Gore-DouglasBarren Islands are waters of Alaska for over which it asserts
jurisdiction»

In the face of those agreements the Japanese

have not entered Cook Inlet.

They have refrained from entering

Cook Inlet, and this, we feel, is the significant fact.

The

Governor of Alaska testified that the Japanese had not
entered Cook Inlet, and the evidence bears this point out.
QUESTIONS
that?

Had they gone into Cook Inlet before

33

MR. CRANSTONs

The only recorded incident of their

entering Cook Inlet is Mr. Ichimura’s testimony at the trial
where for approximately six hours the Japanese fleet was in an
area north of the Barren Islands enroute to Shelikof Strait.
There is no other reported incident, and that incident, may it
jiiease the Court, was not observed by officials of the State
of Alaska.

So we contend that the actions of Japan subsequent

to the agreement clearly are acquiescence.
There is one other point I should like to make.
QUESTIONS

Has the Japanese fishing fleet ever come

into Chesapeake Bay?
’

' MR. CRANSTONs
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice, I —

I draw that.

It's never been in this inlet.

I’m not trying to trap you.

Now, how do you draw from the

fact they haven’t been in since this letter is so great if
it’s never been in there at all?
MR. CRANSTON?

The fact, Mr. Justice, is that the

Japanese protested the application of the agreement to Cools
Inlet, and they expressed concern over that, apparently, and
in the face of their protest, they have abstained from fishing
in Cook Inlet.

They thus felt it was

..

Americans

but they have not followed up.
QUESTION:

They haven’t stopped.

MR. CRANSTON:
QUESTION?

Yes, they have.

They can't stop what they never started.

39
MR. CRANSTON:

They felt that apparently, Mr. Justice,

they had a right to do so or else they would not have protested.
They have abdicated that right by discontinuing their protest.
That coupled with the absence of their fishing is the important
fact demonstrating acquiescence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cranston, I want to be sure.

Has

Alaska now abandoned its claim that sovereignty at one time
was exercised by the Russians?
MR. CRANSTON:

You no longer rely on this?

We feel, Mr. Justice, that that is

not crucial to the disposition of this cause.

We do not

admit nor do we feel the record does indicate that the Russians
at any time ever abandoned sovereignty to Cook Inlet.

However,

3ince the assertions of jurisdiction by the United States and
the State are so longstanding since that time that it has no
bearing upon what this Court should decide with respect to
this case.
QUESTION:

On the Japanese situation, you are taking

the position, I take it, that the absence of Japanese shipping
in Cook Inlet equates with a positive acquiescence in the claim
of sovereignty.
MR. CRANSTON:

That is our position, your Honor.

We feel that it equates with acquiescence.
QUESTION:

Do you have any other instance of any

other foreign nations" acquiescence?
MR. CRANSTON:

Yes, we do, although I would be vary

40
glad to answer that question, if I may.
We feel that the Gharrefct-Scudder line is an
indication of Canada's acquiescence in Cook Inlet, and I would
briefly state why.

The line was drafted upon Canada's

recognition, and this is important, it recognized the regulation
which had been drafted by the United States relative to
fishing in Alaska.

This particular regulation defined the

waters pf Alaska as extending three miles, which can only
relate to territorial sea, from lines extending from headland
to headland across the entrances of bc-ys.

This regulation

adopted in 1957 was apparent to Canada since they asked for
charts which delimited the line in. Alaska described by the
regulation, which in fact defined waters of Alaska.

The charts

wore prepared and transmitted to Canada from the United States
Embassy in Ottawa in 1957, showing Cook Inlet to be within
the line from which the three-mile line was measured.

The

testimony of William Terry indicated that as to Cook Inlet
the Japanese had, no quarrel and there has never been ah
objection registered by Canada as to the placement of the
Gharretfc-Scudder line with respect to Cook Inlet.
some minor dispute as to something down

There is

in the Strait of Juan de

Fuca and something in southeastern Alaska, but not as to Cook
Inlet.

This we consider to be acquiescence by Canada as to

the assertion of sovereignty by the United States through a
regulation determining the 3-mile limit in Cook Inlet.

41
QUESTION?

Bat the fact, is that Canadian fishermen,

mullet fishermen have been in there since.
MR. CRANSTON;

The record» Mr. Justice, and the

finding of the court is that this was done in 1957 subsequent
to statehood.

There have been five vessels undetected in

Cook Inlet.
QUESTION*

If they were undetected, how does anybody

know they were there?
MR. CRANSTONs
QUESTIONS

That's correct.

How do we know they were there?

MR. CRANSTON s

Tlie records of the Pacific Halibut

Commission when a vessel enters any waters under the jurisdiction
of the Halibut Commission, it must file records with that
commission as to where it has fished.

records, Exhibit 78 and 80, indicate

There is one which indicates it was within Chugach
The record also indicates that as to Canadian halibut

vessels, the policy of the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service was to be lenient, and the record also indicates that
