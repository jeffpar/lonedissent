Mr. Munde11, I think we

can resume now in your case, Vella against Ford Motor Company.
T7e show you as having 2 3 minutes remaining.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. MUNDELL, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENT — Resumed
MR, MUNDELLs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
At the conclusion of yesterday afternoon’s session,
I was reciting the facts of this case.

I will not go over

those again, for there are set forth in the counter-statement
of facts in our brief.
I will continue that by saying in February of 1970
the petitioner filed a suit in the district court for the
Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division,

with a Count

for Negligence under the Jones Act, and a Count alleging
unseaworthiness of the vessel under the General Maritime Law
and a Count for maintenance and cure.
The jury decided adversely to the petitioner on
the issue of liability, finding the accident was due to his
sole negligence.

They also found that petitioner was

entitled to a maintenance and cure award for the period from
June 29, I960, the day he left the vessel, until June 29,
1970.
Respondent moved for judgment, notwithstanding the

23
verdict, and Petitioner moved for attorney's fees and interests
and costs? both motions were denied by the district court.
Petitioner -then appealed to the Sixth Circuit as to
the first cause of action pertaining to the negligence under
the Jones Act and to unseaworthiness under the General Maritime
Law, of the jury verdict of no cause for action,
Respondent followed with an appeal as to the propriety
of the maintenance and cure award.
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the
jury verdict of no cause for action as to the liability
question, and reversed as to the maintenance and cure question.
On appeal, Respondent argued at the trial level
that Petitioner went to great lengths to show that he suffered
the vestibular disorder or condition when he left the vessel
on June 20, or June 29, I960, and that such was due to the
accident which he alleged occurred in early April of '60,
Quoting from the opinion of the Sixth Circuirt,
which states Respondent's position with succinctness, we read,
quote s
"The defendant contends that the plaintiff's injury
was permanent from the date of the accident and was never
susceptible of curative treatment.

Dr, Ileil testified that

although he could not determine from his examination what had
caused, the vestibular disorder, a severe blow to the head
could have caused this problem.

Presumably, the jury concluded

24

that it was plaintiff's fall that caused the disorder and the
disabling dizziness and headaches.

However, the evidence

clearly shows that a vestibular disorder is not a condition
that can be cured or improved by treatment.

When asked

whether plaintiff might be cured by treatment, Dr, Ileil
testified?
’"Ho, not really.
matic for this condition.

Treatment is primarily sympto­
That is, people with a vestibular

disorder are apt to have intermittent episodes of dizziness
which, on occasion, are somewhat more severe.

Treatment is

limited to those times when the patient is particularly dizzy.
They can obtain some symptomatic relief with medication.
Other than that, there is no specific cure or treatment,'
"Ho evidence was introduced in conflict with this
conclusion of Dr, Ileil.
"The record ir, this case does not permit an inference
other than that plaintiff's condition was permanent immediately
after -the accident,

it is not even alleged that plaintiff

has ever received treatment for the condition itself, although
he has received medicine for the symptoms of dizziness and
headaches.

That one may require or be helped by treatment for

the symptoms of a disorder does not qualify him for mainten­
ance and cure,

Farrell v, United States, at 519,"

QUESTION;

Mr. Mundell, —

MR, MUNDELL;

Yes?

25
QUESTION:

**“ take the case that your brother opened

with yesterday, let's assume that a seaman has both of his
legs cut off , ~~
MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION;
of the ship.

Yes, sir.

~~ amputated in an accident in the service

Now, clearly, there's no cure for that, if his

legs are gone, they're gone.
MR. MUNDELL;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»

Rut equally clearly, there are measures

that can be taken, in the way of artificial limbs' and his
training to use them, to at least be palliative of the
consequences of the double amputation„

But would it be your

claim that since the double amputation is incurable, at the
moment it occurs, that there's no right whatsoever on the part
of the seaman to maintenance and
MR. MUNDELL:

cure?

No, I would not say that, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, why not?

That's what your argument

is, I think.
MR. MUNDELL:

No.

There is no treatment for

vestibular disorder, apparently,
QUESTION: And there's no treatment for a double
amputation.

You can't put back those legs.

MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION:
of it

No, but I think —

All you can do is deal with the symptoms

26

MR„ MUTI DELL;

A reasonable conclusion , I would think t

Your Honor, would be that the treatment would consist of
the fitting of the artificial limbs.
QUESTION:

Well, then, wouldn't likewise the treat­

ment here consist of mitigating the impact of the symptoms,
even though it's not curable?
MR. MUNDELL:

No, I —

QUESTION: What's the difference?
MR. MUNDELL:

Well, I think in the case of the

double amputation, once the legs are fitted, maybe its cure
would end.
In this case, maintenance and cure, where he's just
being treated for his headaches and dizziness could go on
ad infinitum, the cases are quite clear that maintenance and
cure is not a pension for life, and that's what it would
amount to.
QUESTION:

Let me give you another example to

follow through on Justice Stewart's question.
Suppose in the middle of a long voyage a patient
has a diabetic flare-up.

I 'think this can’t be cured; but

is it your position that the shipowner is not obligated to
afford him such palliative treatment as is available by
insulin?
MR. MUNDELL:

I think, if the Court pleas®,

Calmar vs. Taylor says that the seaman is entitled to

junta-r-gayuawcm:;

27
maintenance and cure for a reasonable period of time after the
voyage# during which time care and nursing might bring him to
a point of maximum cure for his condition.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish between medical

treatment that is curative and palliative?

Isn’t there a

gray zone often as to whether one has run or the other?
MR» MUNDELLs

I think, if the Court please, that

the interpretation of the word "palliative" in the cases
has been stated to mc;an to ease without curing,,
If that answers your question, Your Honor,
QUESTIONS

I suspect that oftentimes a physician

isn’t able to draw that line of distinction with great
accuracy.
NR. MUNDELLs
QUESTION:

I believe that's correct, Your Honor,
Do most ships plying the Great Lakes

have doctors aboard them, or is it always a question of waiting
to get in the Public Health Service Hospital at the end of the
voyage?
MR, MUNDELL:
Honor, are very short.
have doctors aboard,

The voyages on the Great Lakes, Your
None of the ships, to my knowledge,
On occasion, in an extreme case, the

Coast Guard will corns out by helicopter and take a man off the
ship.

But otherwise, because of the shortness of the voyage,

which may be anywhere from, say, four hours from Toledo to
Detroit, to two and a half days to Duluth, they rely on either

28
putting the nan ashore at the port when they arrive, or at
various ports between the port of departure and port of
destination.
For example, leaving Detroit, going to Duluth, a
man might be put off at Sault Ste. Marine, to the Public Health
doctor there.
QUESTION: So that in this case, the injury having
occurred in early April and the plaintiff having been dis­
charged from the service the end of June, there presumably
would have been a series of voyages?
MR. MUNDEEL;

Yes, Your Honor.

At that particular

time the ROBERT S. MaciJAMARA v?as engaged solely in trips
between Detroit and Toledo.
QUESTION;

Just back and forth?

MR. MUNDELLs

Back and forth, from Detroit to

Toledo, which is, in good weather
QUESTION: That's about forty miles, isn't it?
MR. MTU?DELL:

Yes, sir, Your Honor -- sixty miles,

I believe.
QUESTION: Sixty.
MR. MUNDSLLs

~~ and he could receive treatment at

either and.
QUESTION:

Mr. Munde11.

MR. MUNDULE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Powell?

Following up the questions that were asked

you by Hr. Justice Stewart and Mr.

Justice Blackmun, I under-

stood you to say that maintenance and cure did not. last for
life under any circumstances, the test being for a reasonable
period of tine,

I have not read the cases that might shed

any light as to what benchmarks are examined to determine
what is a reasonable time.
Do cases shed light on that?

Take the case Mr,

Justice Stewart put to you of a young man who lost both legs,
or of a man who had emphysema, for example, would be with
him for life, —
MR. HUM DELL 2
QUESTION:

1 believe that —

— how does the Court determine what is

a reasonable time?
MR. MUNDELL:

It depends on the facts of the case,

of course, but I believe that the courts have looked at idle
nature of the treatment, such as Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned,
a man with the legs off, they very likely wouldn't permit the
maintenance and cure until the man was fitted for artificial
limbs.

In the case of a man with, say,chronic bronchitis,

for example, the Court says there’s nothing more that can be
done for him, he’s reached maximum cure, and may stop it.
QUESTION: Generally the cutoff point is, as I think
you've stated, the point where the maximum cure has been
achieved,
MR. MUNDELLs

That's the rule, yes, Your Honor

30

QUESTION;

Unh-hunh, and of course —

MR. MUNDE LI.;

At a point where no further treatment

can improve the condition.

That's the statement from the

cases.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION 3 But palliative treatment could make the
patient more comfortable and perhaps prolong

life# but that

would not be included?
MR. MUNDELL:

No# sir.

Farrell says no.

Along the same lines of the questions put to me a
moment ago, in its opinion the Court set forth the criteria
for the payment of maintenance and cure, which is in
accordance with the overwhelming weight of judicial authority
In discussing the applicable law# the Court stated,
quote s
"Under the maritime law of the United States# a
shipowner is liable to a seaman for maintenance and cure,
regardless of the negligence of either party# if the seaman
is injured while in the service of the ship,"

Citing Aguilar

vs. Standard Oil# 318 U.S. 724 (1943).
"The duty of the shipowner to maintain and care for
the seaman exists only until the seaman is cured to the
maximum extent medically possible,
336 U.S, 511, 518 (194SJ) .

Farrell vs. United States

In brief# once the seaman reaches

'maximum medical recovery', the shipowner's obligation to

31

provide maintenance and. cure ceases,

Vaughn v. Atkinson,

369 U.S. 527, 531 (1962)."
QUESTIONS

May I ask, Mr. Mundell, —

MR. MUNDELL;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
when was it that — on what exact

date was it that Dr. Hail diagnosed, or announced his
diagnosis?
MR. MTNDELLs

March —

QUESTION; That this was incurable.
MR. MUNDELL:

I believe it was March 27, 1972,

QUESTION: Well now, isn't that the date up to which
the jury awarded maintenance and cure?
MR, MUNDELL:

No, Your Honor, they awarded mainten­

ance up to June 29 of 1970.
The reason I recited the facts of the case is there
seems to be no basis or justification for the period selected
by the jury for the payment of maintenance.
QUESTION: Wall, did anyone other than Dr. Hell
ever address the question of whether or not the disease was
incurable?
MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

And the first date that he did was March

27, 1972?
MR. MUNDELLs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Well, why doesn't that fix the point up to

32
which he's entitled to maintenance and cure?
HR. MUNDELLs

Because I believe, even if the man

had been examined the day he left the ship, and the vestibular
disorder
QUESTION! That was June 29, '68, wasn't it?
MR. MUNDELL;

Yes, sir.

And the vestibular disorder found, there was no cure
then, there vzas no cure when Dr. Hell diagnosed it as
incurable.
QUESTION; But the fact is no one knew that in your
record, isn't that so?
HR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION;

That it was incurable?

Yes,

MR.MUNDELLs

Ho, Your Honor, because the respondent's

doctor and -the Public Health on three occasions declared the
man. fit for duty.
And nothing was heard from the man again until
February of 1970 when suit was instituted,
QUESTION; Well, if the diagnosis of Dr. He.il is
correct, then the U, 3, Public Health Service pronouncements
that ha was fit for duty were incorrect?
HR. MUNDELL;

I "would say so.

I Would qualify that

with tills remark, if the Court please.
On the last visit, on September 30 of 1968, the
Public Health doctor said;

if the symptoms persist, the

33
patient should return, and a complete workup would be per­
formed.
The nan never returned.
It's difficult to say at this point, if the man had
returned, if they would not have conducted this test that
would have found the condition.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that's a jury argument,

the jury decided against you on this.
HR. MUNDELLs
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I taka it your position is that if

the disease cannot be cured, then, though it takes ten years
to determine that, he still is not entitled to maintenance
and cure?
MR. MUNDELLs

I would say so, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well now, if you're wrong about that,
Mr. Mundell, in any event, I take it, even if the Petitioner
were entitled up to March 27 of '72, the jury awarded only
up to some time in 1970, was it?
MR. MUNDELL; That is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION; And he never appealed from the jury
limitations in .1970, did he?
MR. MUNDELLs

That's right, there was no appeal on

the jury award.
QUESTION: So I take it, your position would be, in
any event, he's entitled to nothing more than the jury gave

34
him?
MR. MUNDELL:

Absolutely.

Our position is he's entitled to nothing.
QUESTIONS

I know.

QUESTION?,

Mr. Mundell, supposing that at the con­

clusion of a voyage a man has a back complaint, which he
claims was incurred while in the ship's service, and goes
into a

hospital and they keep him there for about three weeks —
MR. MUNDELLs

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONs

and finally say, well, there's nothing

we can do for you, it's a partially slipped disc or something
like that, but there's nothing more we can do for you here.
Shouldn't he be entitled to maintenance and cure
at least during the time it takes that he's submitting to .that
diagnostic procedure?
MR, MUNDELL:

No, Your Honor, because maintenance

and cure is not payable when the seaman is an in-patient in
a hospital.

Because he is, in effect, receiving his mainten­

ance and cure.

He's being cared for there.

QUESTION:

Yes, well, it is payable in that form,

is what you really mean.
MR. MUNDELL:

Yes, sir.

In other words, the shipowner is not paying it.
It's being provided him by the Public Health Service.
QUESTION: But he has no claim to money for that

35
period of time, over and above the hospital facilities?
MR. MUNDE Lb:
QUESTIONs

No, sir.

On the other hand, they wouldn’t ~~ it's

not your claim that he would have to pay for -that three-week
period?
MR. MUNDELL:

No, sir»

Public Health hospitals

are available to merchant seamen free of charge, because,
initially, the Public Health Hospitals were established with
moneys provided by the merchant seamen at the initial
inception of the Public Health Hospitals, and they are
commonly referred to as the Marine Hospitals.
So from -that time on they've been entitled to free
care at Public Health.
QUESTION* Right.
QUESTION:

Which is a taxpayer's, not shipowners',

expense,
MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Suppose the thing were so — such an

emergency that he were taken to a private hospital, there
wasn't.

he wasn't near a Public Health institution; would

he have to disgorge then, or he himself have to pay if it
turns out. that his situation is incurable?
MR. MUNDELL:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

If the man is taken off the ship to a hospital
other than the Public Health, Public Health has told the

36

shipowner to advise them immediately, and they will authorise
the attention.

But if, for some reason the Public Health is

not notified, the shipowner will pick it up,
I would say, for my own principal, they have on
*

many occasions paid for private hospital care, where the Public
Health, for one reason or another, would not pick up the tab.
QUESTION;

That's part of *»- that would be part of

maintenance and cure?
MR. MUNDHLL;

No, it's — it would be in addition

to the maintenance, Your Honor.
The shipowner would just assume that.
QUESTION;

For the good, of the order.

MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION;
a doctor?

That cost.

Yes, sir,

What if the seaman is treated at home by

He's incapacitated at home, like a lot of people

are.
MR, MUNDHLL;
Honor,

I have seen cases such as that, Your

The shipowner —
QUESTION; Say it's with the back, and finally the

doctor says; Well, I just can’t do anything about it.
MR. MUNDELL; Well, if the doctor says he's reached
the point of maximum cure or maximum hospital benefits, then
the cases say the maintenance and cure

ceases.

QUESTION; But meanwhile, you say, he gets his
maintenance and cure?

37

MR. MUNDELLs

Yea, sir, if the doctor sends a letter

to the shipowner sayings

This man is under my care, he’s not

fit for duty. can’t return to work.
The shipowner will pay the maintenance
QUESTION;

Mo, but it turns out — it: turns out

that a doctor says, well, this is all •— since he's left the
Hopefully, I thought maybe

ship he’s been in this condition.
I could do something but I can’t.

So why wouldn't you argue that retroactively he is
disentitled to any maintenance and cure?
MR. MUNDELL:

Because up to that time the doctor

thought he could do something.
And he was treating him.
But the point when the doctor says ~~
QUESTION;

Yes, but he finally says it’s incurable.

MR, MUNDELL: Then the maintenance ends,
QUESTION; And he says;

I now know that it was

incurable from the beginning,
MR. MUNDELL: Then, in effect, the man’s been paid
money to which he was not entitled.
But I've never seen a case where they try to recover
that money.
QUESTION;
MR. MUNDELL:

It just wouldn't be.
No.

QUESTION: Well, how is that different from this case?

38

Dr. Hail, as 1 understood what you said earlier# Mr.
Mundell, is the only one to have addressed the question of
whether it was curable or not.
MR. MUNDELLi

Yes# he ~~

QUESTION'S And he didn't# until March 27# 1972.
MR. MUNDELLs Right.
QUESTION;

Was tliat during the trial?

MR. MUNDELL;
QUESTION;

Yes# sir.

It was at the trial# wasn't it?

MR. MUNDELL;
QUESTION:

Approximately.
Actually at the trial# wasn't it?

QUESTION; Testimony at the trial# apparently.
MR* MUNDELL:
QUESTION;

At the trial and prior to the trial.

Oh# prior to and at the trial.

QUESTION;

Pretrial proceedings.

QUESTION: Wall now# even if in fact it was incurable
from the day he left the ship# why# then# isn't he entitled#
from what, you've just said# up to that data# short of his
failure to appeal to the jury verdict which gave him less# to
maintenance and cure?
MR. MUNDELL:

Well# I think# as Mr. Justice Stewart

pointed out# if we had in fact paid the man the maintenance#
it would just be money down the drain.
QUESTION; But here you hadn’t paid it.
MR. MUNDELL:

We had not paid it because the man had

39

been declared fit for duty.

On four occasions.

And nothing was heard from him until the date of
trial.
Pardon me, until the date suit was filed.
QUESTION:

Unh-himh.

MR. MUNDELL:

But, if the man was in fact not fit

for duty when he left the ship, his condition was in fact not
curable when he left the ship, then the man is not entitled
to maintenance and cure under the cases.
QUESTIONS

Didn’t a man named Dr. Berke examine him

sometime in 1970?
MR. MUNDELLs

Yes, that was the Petitioner's doctor,

he was a neurologist, he examined him, he found a positive
Romberg Test.
As I mentioned yesterday, that is the test where
the man stands with his eyas closed and there's a swaying,
which indicates a balance problem.
And he said that he thought there was vestibular
damage, he didn’t know whether it was permanent or not, he
would refer it to an ear specialist, which Dr. Heil was.
I might also add that in January of 1370, petitioner
was examined by Dr. Jamie Beni tea, who conducted -this
sophisticated electronystagmography test, which is a test
that determines -the vestibular disorder.

At that time, in

January of 1970 ~~ and this is the petitioner's doctor — he

40

found a disorder, in January of 1970.
When we had him examined by Dr. Hail in 1972, in
preparation for trial, he referred him back to Dr. Benitez,
because he's an expert in the tryout on this particular test»
And again Dr. Benitez found a vestibular disorder.
Dr. Benitez v?as never called by the petitioner at trial, and
had he been, he would have had to say that the condition was
incurable in 1970,

If we are to believe Dr. Heil's testimony,

which is unrefuted, on the record.
QUESTION;
HR. MUNDELL;
QUESTION:
MR. MUNDELLs

Well, did you call him?
No, we did not, Your Honor.
Why?
Because we had Dr, Heil,

And we had

Dr. Benite z * s re cords„
I might just conclude, if the Court please, by saying
that the facts of the case at bar are such as call for a
denial of the payment of maintenance and cure in any«mount,
for the simple and cogent reason that petitioner's condition
was incurable at the point of inception.
As the attorney's fees, I request that in the
petition which is an issue not pre-empted by 'this Court,
I would simply refer the Court to the decision of the district
judge who denied the attorney's fees on the grounds that the
shipowner —
QUESTION; Well, that’s not here, anyway.

41
MR. MUMDELLs

No, Your Honor,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Mundell.
Do you have anything further, Mr, Jagues?

You have

about nine minutes left, I think.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD C„ JAQUES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAQUESs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In response to matters posed to my brother, in
further responses
Under a situation where a seaman is afflicted with
illness and is put. ashore, and under a circumstance such as
this where a vestibular labyrinthine disorder is of a
permanent nature, incurable, and he is put ashore and incurs
medical expenses, I think Mr. Mundell has indicated, well,
the shipowner, -through its benevolence, even though it had
no obligation, would make those payments,
I submit that I -would not place much stock on the
benevolence of the shipowner who had no duty to make payments
for medical expenses.
And I think that that really is the proof in part
of the issue of this case.
When liability of a shipowner to a seaman for
maintenance end cure commences and when it ends.
The Sixth Circuit has taken the bold position, the

42
position which lacks, I submit, humanism, that if the incident
renders the seaman unfit for duty at the occurrence and if it
is found to be permanent, then the shipowner has no liability
at all.
The maximum cure occurred, in the words of the Sixth
Circuit, the moment that the trauma was inflicted,,
The shipowner has stated, here that, in response to
a question with regard to this Court having stated in Farrell
vs. United States -that there is no payment for maintenance and
cure when the cure is palliative treatment.
Now, I say this, my brother has indicated in his
brief, on page 14, a quotation stating that the rule in
effect, as stated by this Court, and then he cites -- and then
he recites in quotations.
Now, I'm sure that this is inadvertence on Mr.
Mundell's part, but this Court did not make, ever, that
statement.
As a matter of fact, that statement came from a
Texas court, a Texas State court, in the case of Rav Lewis

- s. -U:VC.=;

ys. Isthmi ah Lines, and that was in the State of Texas, if
came out in 1968 AHC 1688.
And so I submit that this Court has not made such a
pronouncement relative to palliative treatment, not being
"within the purview of the duration of liability of 'the ship­
owners to pay maintenance and cure.

43
Just further* the United States Public Health
Service has a statutory duty to provide care for ill and
injured seamen who are afflicted during the service of the
vessel.
There is* however* a policy of the United States
Public Health Service that if they find the seaman fit for
duty* and then sixty days expires or ninety days* or whatever
period that they have established* expires where the seaman
has not been active, then he is no longer eligible* and that
was 'die situation with Vella.
And. Vella thus became ineligible after that period
of days* and at that time it could have been sixty or ninety*
but whatever, it was a period of days, and he was no longer
eligible for Public Health -QUESTION: Well, he just left his job as a seaman* did
he get another job somewhere ashore?
MR. JAQUES:
QUESTION:
MR. JAQUES:

None ever since.
How old a man is he?
He is about 44, or 45* in that age

vicinity.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jagues* the jury, as I understand it*

gave him maintenance and cure exactly for two years * June 29,
1968 to the date of discharge, the sars date in 1970. Did they
just pick this out of the air as kind of a compromise verdict.,

44
do you think, or what is this significance with the 1970
date?
MR, JAQUES: Well, that certainly is an interesting
question, and I have thought about this. The only thing that
I can say, Your Honor, in response to that is that there was
a period approximating that period of time, when the seaman
was examined by a Dr. Benitez, who was comparable to Dr. Heii
in his specialty, although it was a period of time earlier?
actually it was a trifle earlier than that two-year period.
Now, in response further to Mr, Justice Brennan
with regard to the seaman's right to a kind of perfect
period of time, and other matters that are sought as relief
in this, in the brief of the petitioner, I submit, first of
all, that this Court has declared, way back, following
Justice Storey's declaration of this Court being -- well, a
seaman is a ward of the Admiralty Court, and as such, I
submit, that it's not unprecedented for an award to be made
outside of the area of issues raised below in regard to the
