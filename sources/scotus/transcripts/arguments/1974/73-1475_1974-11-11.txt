MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1475, Harris County Commissioners against Richard E.
Moore.
Mr. Landry, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. LANDRY, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, LANDRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is on appeal from a three-judge court
decision of the Southern District of Texas, declaring, first,
a Texas statute, Article 2351-1/2(c), unconstitutional and
enjoining so much of a Commissioners Court redistricting
order, which had the necessary effect under the statute of
terminating the terms of office of five office holders,
three of whom were Justices of the Peace and two Constables.
The facts of the case, briefly, are as follows:
On March 12, 1973, the Commissioners Court of Harris
County appointed a committee of nine persons to study the
redistricting of both the county's commissioner, precincts, as
well as its justice of the peace precincts.
That committee consisted of a county commissioner,
who himself had served for ten years in the State Legislature
and on the committee in the Legislature for the redistricting

4
measures whi had been taken by the Texas Legislature during
%

his tenure in office.

It also included a justice of the

peace, a constable, a Republican, or a member of the Republican
Party in the county, a member of the Democratic Party in the
county, a Negro, a Mexican-American, and a woman, as well as
\

another — as well as a University of Houston professor who
had some expertise in redistricting. And I might also add
that the County Commissioner was the, and is the, a professor
at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, and heads the
Political Science Department.
After more than two months of study of the
necessity for redistricting in Harris County, that committee
recommended to the Commissioners Court a redistricting plan
for the Commissioners Court, which the Commissioners Court
implemented, and it met the strict requirements of Avery.
QUESTION:
MR. LANDRY:
QUESTION:
MR. LANDRY:

How large was the committee?
The committee of nine, Your Honor.
Nine.
Two weeks after that, it recommended a
*

redistricting plan for the justices of the peace precincts,
and the Commissioners Court, shortly thereafter, with a plan
somewhat different from the plan recommended by the committee,
and it was primarily authored by the Commissioner on the
Commissioners Court and who had served on the committee,
implemented the plan of redistricting of the justice of the

peace precincts.
Now f the justice of the peace precincts prior to
the redistricting plan being put into effect had two justices
in one precinct and one justice in each of the other precincts.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, these are staggered terms,

are they not?
MR. LANDRY:

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

QUESTION: They are staggered terms, are they not?
MR. LANDRY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, they are.

The: —

Would some of them expire, in any event, on

December 31 of this year?
MR. LANDRY: And some on December 31 of 1976, Your
Honor.
QUESTION;

Will the case as to them possibly become

moot then?
MR. LANDRY:

It will not become moot as to the

recovery of the emoluments of the office from the time that
they were ousted from office, pursuant to the redistricting,
to the end of the term of the office.
QUESTION: The newer appointees have qualified and
served, have they, and been paid?
MR. LANDRY:

Yes, Your Honor, they have.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there after

lunch.
MR. LANDRY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

6

[Whereupon,, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m. , the same day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:01 p.rn.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue, Mr.

Landry.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. LANDRY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — Resumed
MR. LANDRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Commissioners Court order of redistricting,
again, was passed by that Court on June 28, 1973, to become
effective July 1, 1973.
The many reasons stated by the three Commissioners
who formed the three-man majority in effecting this redistrict­
ing order, are detailed at page 5 of the Appellants' brief.
Of course, the primary reason for the redistricting in question
was the gross disparities existing between various precincts
as they existed prior to the redistricting action in question.
And I would invite the Court's attention to
Exhibits E and F of the Appellants' brief, which sets out, on
page 58, the precinct map as it existed before the
redistricting in question, and on page 59 the redistricting,
or redistricted precincts after the order was passed.

?
The Court will note that in the precincts 4, 5, 6,
and 7 there were population counts of 81,000, 6,900, 8,800,
11,976 for 4, 5, 6, and 7.
As a result of the redistricting and the attempt
by the Commissioners to make the precincts more reasonably
apportioned, it, of necessity, required the combining of these
precincts to make up one precinct, and that is what happened
in coming up with new Precinct 4, as the Court will note on
the opposite page, page 59.
And there would be no problem, except that Article
2351-1/2(c), which is the statute in question here, provides
that, following a redistricting, where you have such a
situation just as this, where, as a result of combining
precincts to form one precinct and you have an excess number
or surplusage of either JP's or Constables, for the limited
number of positions in the new precinct — and in this case
we had only two authorized JP's and one Constable.
We ended up, as a result of necessarily combining
these various precincts to come tip with a more reasonably
apportioned precinct, with three Justices of the Peace to fill
the two Justice positions and two Constables to fill the one
Constable position.
As a result of that, the Commissioners Court,
under the statute, Article 2355 --- first, 2351-1/2 (c) declares
these positions in the new precinct vacant as a result of that

8
factual situation, and as a result of that the Commissioners
Court is authorized to fill those vacancies which it proceeded
to do.

It appointed one of the three Justices of the Peace

of the former precincts to fill the one of the two new positions
and one of the Constables to fill the one Constable position.
It reached outside of the area of the former
Constables or Justices of the Peace to fill the other Justice
position, and it chose a lawyer to do that with.
The Justice of the Peace of the former precinct
that it chose to fill the other position was one with some
sixteen and a half years' service as a Justice of the Peace
of a former precinct.
Now, as a result of the effect of the statute and
the effect of these facts, that meant that these five office
holders, the appellees in this case, had their terms of
office terminated.

The two Constables, of course, had some

two and a half years to run, until December 31, 1976; the
three Justices of the Peace had until December 31 of this
year in which to fill out their terms of office.
They, as a result of this action of redistricting
and the effect of 2351-1/2 (c) , on the day the redistricting
order was passed, filed suit in State District Court in
Harris County, Texas.
amend that.

And on the following day —- I would

One of the five individual officers filed suit,

that was Appellee Moore

9
On the following day? the District Court denied a
temporary injunction, and without further prosecuting their
remedy in the State Courts, they then filed suit in the
Federal Court on July 20th of 1973.
QUESTION:

And —

Mr. Landry, do you think the real problem

here is that these people were not allowed to fill out their
terms, serve out their terms?
MR. LANDRY:

I think that is solely their complaint,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

If that had been done, do you think you

would have no lawsuit?
MR. LANDRY:

I think not whatever, but of course I

cannot —
QUESTION:

I should ask the other side, but how do

you explain the difference between this statute and the one
that concerns Commissioners as such, which specifically, as I
recall it, permits them to serve out the term?
MR. LANDRY:

I think that contention was answered,

Your Honor, in the case of Whitmarsh v. Buckley, which is of
course set out in our brief.
In Whitmarsh v. Buckley, the Court explained, in
distinguishing the right of a Commissioner to continue to
serve after a redistricting, which places his residence outside
of the precinct from which he was elected, and a situation
where there were school district trustees, who, by reason of

10
a de-armexatiorhad been placed outside of the school
district.

The Court of Civil Appeals in that case declared

that there was a valid distinction, Commissioners are not
precinct officers, they are not elected from the precinct in
which they are to reside to represent only the people who
reside in that precinct, they are elected to represent the
people of the entire county.
Whereas, in this case, the Constable and the two
Justices of the Peace of each precinct are elected to
represent only the people in the particular precinct in
which they are elected to serve.
QUESTION; Well, is that definitively determined as
a matter of State law?
MR. LANDRY;

Not with respect to the difference

between Justices of the Peace and Constables, as opposed to
County Commissioners, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Yes, that's what I mean.

MR. LANDRY; And of course that is one of the
supporting bases upon which we feel that the District Court
should have abstained in this particular case, to give the
State Courts the opportunity to decide that very question,
because one of the major contentions of the appellees in
this case is that they are truly county officers under the
State constitutional provision, Article 16, Section 14; and
that as a result of being classed as county officers whose

II
residence need only be within the county as opposed to
residents within a precinct, then, under 2351-1/2 they should
not be confined to residency within the precinct and 2351-1/2
would be invalid or unconstitutional under State constitutional
Article 16, Section 14.
QUESTION;

And the result, if that were so, Mr.

Landry, would be what, for these petitioners?
MR. LANDRY; They would be able to stay in office,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. LANDRY:

Yes?
They would — I would invite the

Court to look at the precinct map again.

We had Justices of

the Peace, Precincts 5, 6, and 7, who were, in effect, ousted
from office by effect of the statute.
Now, those individuals would simply go to the new
precincts of those same numbers on the opposite page, and
they would then be able to fill out their terms of office.
But that question has never been answered by a
State Court —
QUESTION:

Yes, but they would — that would not

satisfy the voters' claim in this case, would it?

The voters

are also — this case also has its Party voters who claim that
they voted to have these people as their Justices of the Peace
for them, for that jurisdiction, and now —
MR. LANDRY:

Well, that is one of the bases on which

12
the District Court found that the statute was unconstitutional,
i
Your Honor, but we xrould submit —*
QUESTION:

And just keeping these people in office

and giving them their pay and even allowing them to sit in
the news precincts 5, 6, and 7 would not satisfy the voters'
claim , would it?
MR. LANDRY:

No, it would not.

But the fact of the

matter is if the District Court's view is correct with
regard to that line of reasoning, you could never have a
redistricting which changed the line to put a resident or
citizen outside of the precinct, that in which he elected an
officer.

That's right.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION: Well, are you suggesting that the threejudge court, as to the voters' claim, in effect said their
vote was frustrated by the application of the statute?
MR. LANDRY:

I believe that that is what the three■r.-

■

judge court said, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, does that -- perhaps I should

ask tie other side, but-would that mean that, for example,
suppose there was a position and someone was elected to it,
then the Legislature abolished the position, the voters
again would be frustrated, wouldn't they?
MR. LANDRY: Well, in that case, I suppose the
voters would be frustrated, but we submit that the State

13
definitely has that power within its own internal political
structure.
QUESTION;

And that ‘Shis is no different in terms

of the voters?
MR. LANDRY; That s correct;.

There is no contractual

relationship between the voters and the officer,, or, as far
as that goes, between the officer and the State.
QUESTION:

Do you think the three-judge court must

have held that there was a federal right of these voters
involved, some constitutional, federal constitutionally
protected right of theirs to vote for State office?
MR. LANDRY; Well, I think what the court did ■—
QUESTION: They must have said that.
MR. LANDRY:

I think the court said that the rights

of the voters aid the officers in question were intertwined
and any jockeying of the rights of the officers was a
jockeying of the rights of the voters.
QUESTION: 'While I have you interrupted, Mr. Landry,
looking again at — I just want to see how this statute
operates.
Suppose, on the redistricting, there is a district
in which none of the former JP's or Constables live, then what
happens?
MR. LANDRY: Well, under the statute, Your Honor,
that particular precinct has a vacancy or vacancies as to those

14
positions/ and the Commissioners Court then proceeds to
appoint.
QUESTION:

Now, on where you have, as you do, as I

understand, in the redistricted 4, you have places only for
two JP's and one Constable?
MR. LANDRY:

That is correct.

As all of these new

precincts are now. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes,

And in 4 you have actually resident

there how many JP’s?
MR, LANDRY:
QUESTION:

Three Justices of the Peace and —
No, what happens —

MR. LANDRY:

— two Constables.

QUESTION: And two Constables.

Now, do the resident

JP's, the two resident JP's, they lose out, do they?
MR. LANDRY:
QUESTION:
MR.LANDRY:

Well, the ~
Every one loses out?

No, the three Justices of the Peace, Your

Honor, for the two positions authorized —
QUESTION:
MR. LANDRY:

Yes.
— obviously they all three cannot

fill two positions.
QUESTION:
MR, LANDRY:

Right.
So the statute says that those three —

two positions are to be considered vacated.
QUESTION:

That's what I mean.

So none of the

15
resident — it would only be if you had two JP’s and one
Constable living in the district after the redistricting, that
this problem would not arise?
MR. LANDRYs That's correct.

The statute would

then require these two JP's, or entitled these two «TP's to
fill out their terms of office and would entitle, of course,
the Constable to fill out his office,
QUESTIONS

Then I correctly read the three-judge

court, do I, as saying that the reason there is an invidious
discrimination here is between those situations —
MR. LANDRY;
QUESTION:

That's right.
— where you have only three places to

fill and only three people there, they get the jobs; whereas,
if you have three places to fill and five people in the
district, nobody gets the jobs?
MR. LANDRY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

District Court held that because of this differing treatment,
that that was invidious discrimination.
And we submit that the State does in fact have a
compelling State interest which sustains this statute and this
difference of treatment between officers in one precinct and
officers in another.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, are Justices of the Peace

judicial officers under Texas law?
MR. LANDRY: They perform judicial duties, yes, Your

16
Honor.

They handle trials, they have jurisdiction of cases

in civil cases up to $200.
QUESTION: Do you think they are judicial officers
under our cases?
MR. LANDRY:

Your Honor, I'm going to have to

frankly say I do not know the answer to that question.
QUESTION: Well, of course you know that we have not
applied the Reynolds vs.. Sims

principles to election of

judicial officers.
MR. LANDRY:
Your Honor.

I must have missed that case entirely,

With regard to -—

QUESTION:

You may just not have —-•you haven't

run into any cases applying it, that's the thing of it.
MR. LANDRY:

No, I have not.

We have not.

And

we submit that the Reynolds v. Simgr: rule of the one-man/onevote, of course, simply has no application in this kind of a
precinct or this kind of a district.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm suggesting that perhaps as to

the Justices of the Peace.

I don't know whether that would

apply to Constables.
MR. LANDRY: Well, of course, Constables have
jurisdiction outside of their precinct.
QUESTION:
MR. LANDRY:

Yes.
They can serve papers outside of their

precinct, but the fact of the matter is, by law they are

17

required to reside within their precinct, as are the Justices
of the Peace»
But we submit that the reason for the compelling
State interest, which would sustain this kind of a statute
and sustain the differing kinds of treatment between officers
of the same class, is Texascs requirement of residency within
the precinct.

And that is the thing that distinguishes, of
>'• ■

course, the different treatment between Justices of the Peace
and Constables on the one hand, and County Commissioners
on the other, following a redistricting of the precincts
that
QUESTION?

Justice Blackmun asked you before lunch

whether one or two of the —the terms of one or two of these
may expire December 31.

Are they eligible for reelection?

MR. LANDRY? They were eligible for the general
election this year, Your Honor? in fact, one of the appellees
in tills case, Judge Zaboroski, ran this year after having been
ousted as a result of the redistricting.
’QUESTION? And did he win?
MR. LANDRY:

No, sir, he did not.

Now, the two — the three Justices of the Peace,
of course, their terms end December 31 of this year, the two
Constables have two more years following December 31 of this
year.
QUESTION: ’["That do you suppose the — what did the

10

three-judge court mean by convenience redistricting?
MR. LANDRYs Well, that is the term set out in the
constitutional Article — State constitutional Article 5,
Section 18, which is the authority, Your Honor, for the
redistricting by a Commissioners Court of its county's
justice precincts.
QUESTION s

Well, why do they call —• has that

got some special meaning, "convenience"?
MR. LANDRY: Well, the phrase, of course, is "for
the convenience of the people", and I think probably this —
QUESTION:
MR. LANDRY:

I see.
— Court went into great study and

great deliberation of that phrase in Avery v. Midland County,
and of course in Avery v. Midland County,
QUESTION:

Well, they didn't -- we didn't zero in

on the word "convenience" —
MR. LANDRY:

Well, "convenience" of course, in

terms of Justice of the Peace precincts, now that this Court
has decided that one-man/one-vote applies to Commissioners
Court, "convenience of the people" would include primarily,
of course, population, and there's no question but that
there was a compelling need to redistrict in this case in
light of the gross disparities in population of the old
precincts.
In addition to that, there would be the workload, or

19
the amount of services required by a particular area.
For instance, in one precinct there niay well be a greater
crime rate, which would require greater workload of the
Constable as wall as the two Justices of the Peace.
There is, of course, the geography, the matter of
square mileage.

There are any number of factors which the

Commissioners Court would consider in arriving at the shape
and the size of the new precincts, of these kind of new
"precincts.
But, in addition to contending that the State does
indeed have a compelling State interest to sustain the
particular statute in question, that is, the precinct
residency requirement of these various offices, and we of
course cited and quoted from in our brief the case of Hadnott
vs ■ Amos, an Alabama case .involving Circuit Judges of that
State, which this Court affirmed.
In addition to that compelling interest we would
submit that the District Court should have abstained in this
particular case for the reason that there are State constitu­
tional questions, State constitutional considerations which,
if decided by the Texas Supreme Court, would give all of the
in the appellees' favor, v/ould avoid the Federal constitutional
question.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Landry.

Mr. Friloux.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF C. ANTHONY FRILOUX, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE GENE ZABOROSKI
MR. FRILOUX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Might I just state one short comment in regard to
the totality of the atmosphere of this redistricting order,
Your Honors, and then get very specifically honing in on
the constitutional question.
This redistricting order which took place by a
three-two vote of a Democrat majority of three Democrats
on the Commissioners Court, took place in quite an unusual
set of circumstances.
There was a committee that has been mentioned by
the counsel for the petitioner, who had supposedly met and
they came up with seven or eight plans.

Well, on the night

or the eve of the date on which this order was passed,
Commissioner Bass by himself, according to the testimony in the
Appendices here, designed a new plan at night; did not inform
the other Commissioners of it; walked into the court and
presented it, and they passed it three-two to go into
effect three days later.
I represent Judge Zaboroski, who was the only
Republican Justice of the Peace selected at that time in
Harris County since reconstruction days.

21
In our pleadings , when we decided to seek -the forum
proper to the relief which we felt we were entitled, we filed
suit under both civil rights statutes, under those in Title
42, 1983, 1985, and Title 2.8«

'

"

We filed also for the dilution and the abasement
of the vote of the class of voters within the respective
precincts, and the unequal treatment of voters in the same
class, and particularly for political discrimination against
a minority party in a county habitually, traditionally, and
to date controlled by the Democrat Party.

And, even more

fundamentally, the unusual and unbelievable circumstance
at this time and place — at this time and circumstance.
The use of racial discrimination to create enclaves within a
city, which is an admission in the deposition testimony in
the Appendices that they were setting up these racial enclaves
to assure that certain members of certain, and only certain,
ethnic and racial groups would be able to be elected to
office and to succeed themselves in office.
And of course, then, malapportionment.

The

precincts were not in fact brought back into line with any
serious attempt at the Avery rule of one-man/one-vote, and
the disparity is still as bad as it was.
QUESTION:
MR. FRILOUXs

Well,, it isn't as bad as it was, is it?
Wasn’t as bad, but it still is

substantially out of line with, I think, our concepts as they

22
are evolving today, Your Honor,
QUESTION;

But you didn't complain of it x?hen it was

more porrly apportioned than it is now,
MR. FRILOUX;

I don't understand the question.

We didn't complain —
QUESTION; Well, you said one of the grounds of
your action for the three-judge district court was malappor­
tionment.
MR. FRILOUX;

Yes.

QUESTION: And yet you never complained of the even
more poorly apportioned Justice districts that existed
before the Commissioners took this action.
MR. FRILOUX;

Your Honor, when I was employed in

this case, I immediately complained about "as it now exists",
but I think it's still significantly out of line with the
intent and tenor of the Court's decisions in all of the cases
requisite to apportionment.
QUESTION:

But do you mean you asked that the

redistricting be set aside?
MR. FRILOUX;

I sure did, Your Honor.

That was -—

we asked that the redistricting be set aside on the basis
that the statute was facially and in its application
unconstitutional.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Under what ■— oh, excuse me, go ahead.
I'm just trying to get this clear.

I

23
thought all you were after was to get the appellees their jobs
back „
MR. FRILOUX;

Not at all, Your Honor.

We're asking

for damages for violation, of civil rights, substantial damages
we're asking for deimages based on the political discrimination
under the Fifteenth Amendment.

Our petition is quite

extensive.
QUESTIONS Well, I understand that, but' it's all
damages.

You didn't ask that they be required to redo this

plan on the one-man/one-vote basis, did you?
MR. FRILOUX:

We've raised it, that it’s

unconstitutional because —QUESTION s Did you ask for that remedy?
No, I didn't ask for the remedy that

MR. FRILOUX;

the Court issue an order ordering redistricting.

I think that

should be left to the Commissioners Court to do it as it
historically has been done, Your Honor.
Now, in addressing myself to the question of —
QUESTION; What Federal constitutional significance
do you think this disparity is?
MR. FRILOUX;
thing, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

It's a dilution of the vote, for one

It ~~
Well, what cases here would indicate

that this so-called malapportionment of the JP districts would
raise a federal question?

24

MR. FRILOUX:

Perhaps I can answer it this way.

First, the State has no obligation whatever upon itself to
determine that these offices be done by election. They have
an absolute right to have them appointed, or any manner which
they presume, as I understand the law.

In this case, having

assumed and given to the citizens of this State the right to
select these people by election, even though they had an
option not to do so, at that point the Fourteenth Amendment
protections would come into being.
And we say that when you have citizens in one
precinct whose vote is not equally effective, whose vote is
diluted, then you have the Fourteenth Amendment coming into
play.
Now —*
QUESTION:

But your clients, if there had only been

— your clients were only two in number, JP's —
MR. FRILOUX:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— and they both lived in district,

redistricted 4, and you had another client, a single client
that was a Constable and he lived in the redistricted 4, you
wouldn't be here, would you?
MR. FRILOUX:

Unless some other one who was thrown

out had come to me, Your Honor,
QUESTION:
your only clients --

No, no, I’m saying — if those were

MR. FRILOUX:

Those people would not be here.

QUESTION: That's right.
MR. FRILOUX: Because they would not have been abused.
QUESTION: Right.

And if that were the case, you

would not have been seeking a redistricting, a redoing of
the redistricting plan, would you?
MR. FRILOUX:

That's right, because those particular

people would not have complained, they had not been harmed.
But those who came under the alternate provisions
would have been harmed, and they would have been here seeking
this relief.
There's no way you can take this statute and look
at it and justify the fact that people within the same class
are treated differently, and office-holders within the same
class are treated differently.
QUESTION:

Justice White asked you a minute ago

what cases from this Court you rely on to raise the federal
question as to the districting requirements.

What federal --

what cases of this Court do you rely on?
MR. FRILOUX:

You mean in so far as asking them to

redistrict, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, FRILOUX:

We did not ask for redistricting at

this time.
QUESTION;

Well, but you say there is a federal or

26

constitutional malapportionment claim, which I understand
you are asserting; what cases of this Court do you rely on
to support it?
MR. FRILOUX:

I think the same, Avery, and I think

Reynolds both, Your Honor, and I think the same ruling that
applied to Commissioners would apply here, once the Fourteenth
Amendment attaches.
If the Fourteenth Amendment protections exist, so
that in truth and in fact the right to vote becomes absolute,
then I think the right to have that vote counted equally
follows in natural course.
Now, there have been no decisions on this level, as
far as I can determine from the law.

The Court has ruled

definitively on the Commissioners Court.
Now, we are a sub “-component -— a sub-political
component of the State and the county.

The State has seen

fit to confer upon the citizens of that particular subdivision
the right to vote as a method in which they will select those
people who perform these particular duties, whether
administrative, judicial, or legislative, on that level.
Once having done that, then we say that the
Fourteenth Amendment protections come in, and when they come
in I think they carry inherently with them, under these
decisions, the fact that they should be counted equally.
They should not be diluted.

They should not be abrogated, as

27
this statute does.

It allows those who vote for one man

to have the benefit of this man serving in office.

On the

same time, at the same circumstance, it says to another group
of peoples

We're sorry, but you voted for this man, he may

still have two years to go — as my client did

in office?

but we’re not going to give you your choice, we're going to
put this man that lives in the next precinct, who you never
had a choice to vote for, in your precinct.

And just

absolutely destroy the vote in that case.
And in the third case, where everybody voted for him,
and if they still lived within the district, all three of
them were there, they declared everybody vacant and then
appoint three new people who -- as they did in this case?
most of these appointments were political appointees who were
friends of this majority court.
Now, the statute — and I'd like to address myself
to the statute itself, because really the basic question is
whether the statute itselfJ within its own provisions, sows
has the seeds of its own destruction.

And that is' whether

the provisions of the statute, on its face, is, and creates —QUESTION s

May I ask a dumb question?

MR. FRILOUXs

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONsAre Justices of the Peace judicial officers
in Texas?
MR. FRILOUX:

They perform judicial functions.

They

28
are a county officer, Your Honor, and they do — it's naver
been defined as a pure judicial office, it's not a court of
record, but they do do judicial duties.
And I would think in a judicial construction of

it

it would probably be determined that it was judicial in
nature.
QUESTION: And they are covered to the same extent
as other elected officers, in so far as this Court is
concerned?
MR. FRILOUX;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And the case being what?
MR. FRILOUX:

In so far as judicial officers being

covered?
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. FRILOUX:

In regard to Fourteenth Amendment

rights, Your Honor, I think the fact that the Commissioners
Court, which is a court, would provide some, and the
decisions which would return that case would provide some
authority for it.
Now, I didn't anticipate this question, and I can't
give you a specific decision of this Court which reaches down
into this level and says that a Justice of the Peace, of
the type we have in Texas, is covered by a Supreme Court
decision which says that this must be so.
I don't think it's been met by this Court on this

29
level, and -this is what X think we need to address ourselves
td «
QUESTION:

Now, you have used the term, Commissioners

Court, two or three times? is this an actual court or is it
something in the Southern sense, or the New England sense
it's different from a judicial court?
MR. FRILOUXs Well, it's called the Commissioners
Court.

It sits as a court.

Its decisions are appealable in

a court manner, but it has legislative and administrative
duties.

It's a hybrid, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Does it actually decide litigated cases?
MR. FRILOUX:

No, sir, but the District — the County

Judge himself does hear cases, but the court as an entity makes
decisions, it does not sit in normal litigation type circum"
stances, albeit it's called a court.
But its primary duty is legislative-administrative.
As I try to interpret it.
QUESTION:

And in other States it’s generally

called the County Commissioners, isn’t it?
MR. FRILOUX:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think this is an

old historical term that’s been used, and it's evolved.
QUESTION:

In Texas and Missouri and maybe some other

States called them the County Court.
MR. FILCUX:

Right.

QUESTION: This is why, in Massachusetts, it’s

30

referred to as the Supreme Judicial Court.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. FRILO0X:

Yes, Your Honor.

I need to ~
QUESTION:

If you would •—

MR. FRILOUXs

I have a very limited time, because

of split argument, and I did want to address myself to one
of the first questions asked as to ray client and several
others, as to whether the relief sought would become moot.
And I would call the Court's attention to the Texas
Constitution itself, Article 5, Section 18, wherein it sets
out the absolute authority and the mandate of authority to
the Commissioners Court.

And it provides in each precinct

there shall be one elected Justice of the Peace and one
Constable, each of whom shall hold his office for a fouryear period.
It says for four years; and, comma, until his
successor shall have been elected and qualified.
Now, in regard to whether or not this becomes moot,
if this statute is found facially unconstitutional, then the
office-holders unlawfully removed from office, who are still
under the Constitution of Texas itself entitled to and/or
the lawful office — and they can remain in that position
until the County Conanissioners see fit, either to fill that
vacancy or to provide an election as the Constitution says

31
at the next general election.
So it*s not a moot question.
Now, the question of whether or not it should be
remanded because of the nature of the office, Article 5,
Section 24, is definitive, in ray judgment.

It says:

removal

of county officers.
In other words, the Constitution of the State of
Texas, at its inception, defined who were county officers,
and it says:

county judges, county attorneys, clerks of the

District and County Courts, Justice of the Peace, Constables,
and other county officers, -including Justices and Constables,
may be removed ~ and they set the method of removal.
And no where does the Constitution say that they
can be removed by any other body, for any other purpose,
than the constitutional reason.
And v/hat w© have here with the statute, setting by
legislative edict, additional manners of removal.

It also

sets by legislative edict the manner in which the justices
shall be left in office or taken out of office.

None of which

conforms to the removal section of the Constitution, and none
of which is consistent with it, but rather incontravention of
it.
Now, the primary objection to this statute on its
face is that where three people of the same class, who are
elected officials, my client who was removed from office,

32

Client B who remained by happenstance, because — or by
deliberation when the lines were drawn, which we must not
ignore the political realities of life in this case; or,
third, where two people who were there and remain
but had to go out because two of them resided in a precinct
where only one went, so they both were declared vacant.
So we have three people, all elected Justices of
the Peace, under this order, who were treated in entirely
different wayss

one remains in office, two are removed.

And, of course, the same thing applies to the
voters. There is no question that where the voters in one
precinct vote for their man, and then find out that — this

*

could happen again next week, incidentally, they have the
power to redistrict at any time; the only provision is that
very, very general statement "for the convenience of the
people".
And the reasons given in this case by the appellant,
petitioner here, simply were after-the-fact reasons. They
were specified publicly, but in truth and in fact they did
little to accomplish what they wanted, except in two areas.
Tney got the people they wanted in office? and they created
the minority, ethnic enclaves of two groups that would
politically help them in office? which is graphically
reflected, and I don't think it can be controverted, in the
Appendices of the depositions of the majority Commissioners.

33
New, there is one other thing I'd like to call the
Court's attention to — my time is just about up — and that is
that the day before the three-judge court ruled, the Texas
Attorney General, who is not here defending thi3 case, even
though it has Statewide application to every county in Texas,
ruled in an advisory opinion, and it's only advisory, it does
not have the standing of law, that Justices of the Peace and
Constables elected tc full-term are entitled to 3®rve the
entire four years, and a redistricting of their precincts by
the County Commissioners Court, resulting in a Justice or
Constable not living in his preoinct, does not vacate his
office.
Obviously they read the constitutional provisions
I've addressed to the Court; also the rulings in relation to
the Commissioners Court in an attempt to have equal treatment
of

officers within the same area.

And we say because of these

three variances, both as to voters and as to persons within
the same class, that this statute, on its face, in itself,
is unconstitutional, and would —
QUESTION:

If the Attorney General takes that

position, why isn't he here?
MR. FRILOUX:

I don't know, Your Honor.

We requested

— I think my co-counsel requested that he appear, and he
declined.
QUESTION:

Well, if the iVttorney General's — if that

34
opinion of the Attorney General should turn

out to be the

law of Texas, then you wouldn't have the same lawsuit you
have now at all, would you?
MR. FRILOUX:

Not in the future, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And doesn’t that suggest that the
District Court should have at least abstained, to find out
what the law of Texas is?
MR. FRILOUX:

No, because they have historically

ignored, generally, the opinion — these are advisory
question-and-answer sessions.

We could not get the relief

sought, Your Honor, in a Texas court, in any type of
reasonable or equitable time.

They had no right to give us

the relief under the Civil Rights Act.

They had never

addressed themselves or have never — there are statutes
which would have allowed the political discrimination Act to
be brought up.
They have no declaratory act-of a similar nature
of the federal court to go directly to the Texas Supreme
Court, albeit one of the respondents cried, and was denied
where they had an opportunity and refused it.

All they

have is a right of mandamus to direct ministerial acts in
those perfunctory tasks.
So we had to either come to Federal Court with
substantial questions, with a chance for resolution, or stand
by and go to the District Court — it takes 16 months in

35

Houston to get a case heard — go to the Court of Appeals,,
another four to six months; go to the Texas Supreme Court,
hoping that somewhere within the next three to four years
we might seek relief ~ all of the time we had no equitable —
QUESTIONS Well, but the District Court issued a decree
on the hypothesis that the Texas law provided for ohfe thing,
and you've now just told us that that's far from clear.
MR. FRILOUXs What is that, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

I don't see how any Federal Court can

decide a case if the State lav/ is unclear.
MR. FRILOUXs

I don't think the statute — our

position is that the statute on its face is not unclear.
It's
QUESTION:

Well, you just told us that the Attorney

General of the State of Texas told us that it meant something
quite different.
MR. FRILOUXs

Well, this is an opinion, Your Honor,

that I think the Attorney General felt that because ~ and he
gave it in the face of —
QUESTION* Right.
MR. FRILOUXs

— of the statute, I realize that.

But -- simply, I wish he hadn't, because we had the matter in
litigation.

But he was not aware, I'm sure, of the fact that

it was before a three-judge federal court.
Again, it has no legal bearing in the State of Texas.

36

and significantly, I guess, he's —
QUESTION;

But the Attorney General’s opinion

wouldn’t reach — wouldn't solve the voters' claim, would it?
MR. FRILOUX:

None whatsoever, Your Honor.

It would

have no —* it would only address itself to the limited
question of, Could they stay in office?
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Now, these people --

Yes.

MR. FRILOUX:

That's all.

to the substantial questions in the voting.

MR. FRILOUX:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gilleland.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. GILLELAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. GILLELAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
To further answer some of the questions that the
Court apparently has in regard to whether or not the Texas
law can solve some of the problems, I'd like to give the
Court a brief history of the prior law, prior to 1965, when
2351-1/2(c) came into existence.
Article 5, Section 18, which is the State constitu­
tional provision governing the Justice of the Peace and

37

the Constables and Commissioners, was adopted by the residents
of the State of Texas in 1876.

That Constitution is still in

effects
In 1895 we had a definitive decision by the Supreme
Court of Texas interpreting Article 5, Section 18, on the matter
of redistricting Justices of the Peace and Constables.
I have cited the case in my brief, Your Honors, and that case
is styled Rigsby v. Dowlen, of course decided by the Supreme
Court of Texas.
Again, 1922, in a case styled Williams v. Castleman,
the Supreme Court further interpreted Article 5, Section 18.
Now, both of these cases, both by the highest
appellate court in the STafce of Texas, concluded that when
Justice of the Peace and Constable precincts are redistricted,
when the old precincts cease to exist and the nev, order
becomes effective, that the new offices come into existence
vacant.
Now, then, to relieve some of the harsh effects of
the Supreme Court decisions, interpreting Article 5, Section
18, the Legislature in 1965 passed 2351-1/2 (c).
One problem that we have had, and we have had to
resort to the Federal Court, is because of the prior rulings of
the Supreme Court of the State of Texas.
If we were to attack in a State Court the provisions
of 2351-1/2 (c), \\?hich we would of necessity have to do, because

38
that's the tool that was used by the county in removing the
appellees from office, assume that we were successful in
our attack, challenging the constitutionality of 2351-1/2(c)
before a Texas Court, the Supreme Court, then the doctrine of
stare decisis would re-implement the decisions of Williams v,
Castleman and the Rigsby case of 1895 in their interpretation
of Article 5, Section 18, leaving the appellees in a worse
position than they were prior to challenging 2351-1/2(c) .
QUESTION:

Now, the 1965 Act was just designed to

ameliorate part of the consequences of those Texas
constitutional decisions*
MR. GILLELAND:

That is correct, Your Honor.

So that is the main problem —
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t you have the same result — why

wouldr. "t that be the case if a three-judge court holds these
Acts unconstitutional?
MR, GILLELAND:

That we would have to challenge

the -'QUESTION:

I know, but why wouldn’t — if the

1965 legislation is unconstitutional, aren’t you back at
where you were before?
MR. GILLELAND:

Your Honor, it would be my position

that the declaratory judgment that we sought in the threejudge panel hearing, and that was subsequently issued by
that court, was that any — that 2351-1/2(c) was facially

39

unconstitutional.

And of course its effect was to remove an

elected official from office, and in the opinion of the Court
it states specifically that any Act, or this particular Act,
that would remove an elected official -QUESTION s

Yes, but under the old law, all of the

offices were vacated.
MR. GILLELAND:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: So there wasn't any discrimination.
MR. GILLELAND:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Wouldn't the three”judge district court

have had to hold the Texas constitutional provisions invalid,
too?
MR. GILLELAND:

No — would you repeat your question,

sir?
QUESTION: Well, since the '65 Act was just to
ameliorate some of the conceived hardships visited by the
earlier Texas decisions interpreting the Texas Constitution,
if the three-judge district court were going to restore your
people to office, wouldn't it have had to hold those Texas
constitutional provisions unconstitutional under the Federal
Constitution?
MR. GILLELAND:

Your Honor, I would probably agree

with the Court that it would and should have gone further in
its decision, I believe that that matter was attacked in the
lower court; but the three-judge panel did not address itself

40

to all of the issues that were raised at that level, and
they in fact concluded on two particular issues f with reference
to equal protection and due process of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

One being that legislative classification, where

you have one officer who stays in office simply because of
where he lives after redistricting, and another is removed
simply because of where he lives after redistricting, that
that act in itself is invidious, and discriminatory.
And their second holding would be that the due
process clause guarantees the right to vote, that the right
to vote is a fundamental right, and that the Act which would
cut short or abridge the right of the voter by cutting
short the term of the office of the elected official violates
the due process *—
QUESTION:

Then the due process theme of the three-

judge district court would hold that the Texas constitutional
provisions invalid, just as surely as it would the '65
legislative Act?
MR. GILLELANDs

I see what ‘the Court — yes, sir.

Just carrying it one step further in reasoning, it would,
even though it wasn't specifically set out in the Court’s
order.
QUESTION:

Nov/, what the order of the Court did was

not to keep these people in office simply, but to absolutely
enjoin the redistricting, didn't it?

41
MR. GILLELAND:

Yes, sir.

I don’t recall the

specific order, except X believe it said that Article 2351-1/2(c)
was facially unconstitutional, and that they were enjoined in
so far as removing these elected officials.
QUESTION:

No, it didn’t say any tiling of the kind.

No, it didn't —
MR. GXLLELANDs
QUESTION:

Maybe I’m wrong.

—* it was much broader.

It said the

order of the Commissioners Court of Harris County, Texas, of
June 28, 1973 — and that was the redistricting order.

In

other words, the redistricting order complained of is therefore
permanently enjoined.
MR. GILLELAND: That is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

On page 35 of —

MR„ GILLELAND:

Yes.

On page 40 of Appellee Moore’s

brief. Your Honor.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. GILLELAND:
QUESTION:

They enjoined —

Didn't allow any redistricting at all.

MR. GILLELAND:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Under the terms of 2351-172(c).

Well, under — yes.

Well, just didn’t

allow any redistricting —
MR. GILLELAND: That is correct.
QUESTION:

— any redistricting that would result,

presumably, in the change of a residence of a magistrate or

42

a commissioner or JP.
MR. GILLELAND:

Yes, sir.

Your Honor, if I may carry that argument one point
further, on the matter of redistricting, we are not —
QUESTION 2

MR. GILLELAND:

No, sir, the —

QUESTION: The order says that.
QUESTION: But this says only in so far as defendant’s
order of January 30 undertakes to appoint other persons.
QUESTION: The Court speaks through its order.
This order was entered, I suppose, wasn’t it?
MR. GILLELAND:

This was ■—

Yes, it was entered, Your HOnor.

That is —■
QUESTION:

At page 35, beginning on page 34.

MR. GILLELAND:
QUESTION:

The Court speaks through its order, I

suppose, in Texas, as it does in most places.
MR. GILLELAND:

Yes, sir, it does, Your Honor.

And it would be my contention, should we seek to hold someone
in contempt, it would be by virtue of the order and not the
opinion.

No, sir.

You didn't ask to submit an order?

the concluding paragraph of the opinion says, isn't it?
MR. GILLELAND:
think that

Yes, sir.

I'm in agreement.

I

I was quoting the opinion rather than the order

a moment ago.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GILLELAND:

But for the Court’s consideration,

we are not challenging the redistricting as such.

We will

be the first to admit and stipulate that redistricting is
needed.
QUESTION:

Well, what the order does, it sets it

aside.
MR. GILLELAND:

Yes, sir, simply because the effect

of that order is to remove elected officials from office, ~
QUESTION:

I know, but if we affirm, then that

redistricting goes out the window, doesn't it?

44
MR. GILLELAND: That particular redistricting, Your
Honor; but under Article 5, Section 18, the Commissioners
Court of Harris County, Texas, would still have the authority
to radistrict pursuant to any instructions that they might
have.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, may I ask — your colleague

argued the inconsistency between Section 24 of your State
Constitution — that's the removal section?
MR. GILLELAND:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— and Section 18.

In those earlier —

in those earlier Texas Supreme Court decisions, was that
supposed inconsistency argued, do you know, and decided?
MR. GILLELAND: Well, with reference to county
officers, sir?
QUESTION:

Well, the county officers, including

Justices of the Peace.
MR. GILLELAND:

Yes, sir.

Your Honor, as far as I know, under Texas law,
including the statement Mr.Landry made to the Court, there
is no requirement that an elected official reside in the
precinct in which he is elected.
The only requirement is that the election code
requires that you be there to be elected.
QUESTION:

I!m afraid I haven't made myself clear.

Section 24, as I understood your colleague, he argues that

45
there is an inconsistency that that's the only way you can
remove a Justice of the Peace from office.

In other words,

for cause shoxvn, being set forth in writing and the finding of
truth by the jury.
MR. GILLELAND:

Your Honor, that would be an

inconsistency between 2351-1/2(c) and
QUESTION;

the constitutional ~

No, it would be also an inconsistency

between — would it not —■ Section 24 and Section 18?
Independently of the statute.
MR. GILLELAND;

Yes, sir, that is correct, Your

Honoro
QUESTION; Well, what I'm asking is, in those early
Supreme Court decisions, did they aver address that alleged
inconsistency?
MR. GILLELAND;

No, sir.

Thank you for the opportunity for appearing.

MR. GILLELAND;
QUESTION;

Yes?

-- let me ask you one question before you

sit down.
About just what is going on in Harris County now,
in connection with this.
district

As I understand it, the three-judge

court judgment was entered January 30th, and on —

in 1974 — on February 4th, 1974, Justice Powell granted a
stay and the full Court, our full Court declined to set it

46

aside on February 19th.
Now, has anything happened to carry out the
Commissioners Court’s orders?
MR. GILLELAND;

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

Our election

deadline was on February the 4th, the day that Justice Powell
entered his order, and the boundaries as established by the
redistricting order of the Court were permitted to carry
through in our Democratic and Republican Primaries, and
consequently we have now officials who have been elected at
the General Election, as of last Tuesday, from the new
boundaries.
QUESTION; Well, in other words, the district
court’s order was — was stayed; was stayed.
MR. GILLELAND;

I see.

Yes, sir.

And so the effect of the staying order removed my
officials again from office, who took office on the 1st and
they were back out on the 4th.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. GILLELAND;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

But they have, and you have surviving a

damage claim, don’t you?
MR. GILLELAND; We hope we do, Your Honor.

That

question hasn't been —
QUESTION; Well, I mean, you asserted one.
MR. GILLELAND; We did assert one, Your Honor, but

47
it has been denied by the county.

We've made demand on

several occasions for it.
QUESTION? Did you have — did you assert a damage
claim

a damages claim before the three-judge court?
MR. GXLI.ELAND:

Nc, sir, it has not been asserted,

it is on file, a motion is on file, but the court has not
ruled yet as to whether or not it will hear the issue of
damages before the three-judge panel.
We expect the Court to address itself to that
question in the near future.
QUESTION: But you think they — if you win?
MR. GXLLELAND:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes.
Your complaint in the federal court did

pray for damages?
MR. GILLELANDs

Yes, sir.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Do you have anything
further, Mr. Landry?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. LANDRY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.
MR. LANDRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would just answer some of the contentions made by
counsel for the appellees.
First, with respect to Mr. Friloux' charge -that

48
this redistricting was bottomed on racial discrimination
basis.

I would submit that that is not consistent with this
?

Court’s decision in White v. Rs jester, in which the Court
upheld the ruling of the district court striking down multimember districts in Texas on the ground that they suppressed
minority participation in the political arena.
In this particular case,

the Commissioners made

no bones about the aim, as one of the objectives of this
redistricting, to promote minority participation; and to
that end they did in fact, in a precinct with some 35 percent
Latin American population, appoint a Latin American Constable
as well as two Justices of the Peace of Latin American
extraction.
Also with regard to Precinct Ho. 7, which had a
58.4 percent black population, they appointed one Negro
Constable and two Negro Justices of the Peace.
We would submit to the Court that that objective of
many that are set out at page 5 of Appellants’ Brief, is a
laudable one on the part of the Commissioners Court.
With respect to Mr. Friloux and Mr. Gilleland’s
contentions that Article 5, Section 24 of the Constitution,
that is the State Constitution, classifies these officers as
county officers.

That may well be true, but in the Whitmarsh

v. Buckley case, which is a Court of Civil Appeals case, no
xtfrit history, the fact of the matter is there the Court

49
classed school district trustees as county officers, and
yet they applied Article 1.05 of the Election Code to say
that they were confined to residency within the school
district, which was an area less in size than the county as
a whole.
And whether or not these individuals are county
officers, we would submit, is not a question for this Court
to decide.

It is a question truly for the Texas Courts to

decide, as to whether or not these officers are county
officers under the State Constitution, and whether or not
they should be treated the same as the County Commissioners,
in Section B of the statute.
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Landry, did you make any

point before the three-judge court of the seeming broader
order than the last paragraph of the opinion indicated would
be entered?
MR. LANDRY:

Your Honor, no, we did not.

We of

course had not been before the district court except to seek
a stay of its order.
QUESTION:

Oh, you weren’t involved in the defense

of that suit?
MR. LANDRY:

Yes, we were, Your Honor.

Maybe I

misunderstood your question.
QUESTION:

No, I -— reading this order, it’s broader

than the opinion indicated would be given to the plaintiffs

*

50
in this -MR. LANDRY:

That's correct.

But, as I have said

in answer to the question, we've only been before the court
since the order, in an attempt to seek a stay.
QUESTION: And didn't argue that this is broader
than what you said in the opinion ~
MR.LANDRY:

No, we did not, Your Honor.

But, of course, we argued that it, the order, was
far overreaching when we sought the stay from Mr. Justice
Powell.
QUESTION: Which came down first, the "opinion or
the order?
MR. LANDRY: The order came down on —
QUESTION: Then the opinion was followed ~ didn't
it?
MR. LANDRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

The order came down

on January 30th, the opinion came down on February the 8th.
We, of course, have discussed at great length the
seeming disparity.

We have assumed that the order is to be

read in the light of the court's opinion, and therefore the
order is much tempered by the opinion, of course.
QUESTION: But the opinion followed, and you think
that, in effect, modified the order, or not?
MR. LANDRY: Well, that's just our opinion, Your
Honor.

51
QUESTION?

Well, in any avent, you didn't go to

the court and say, Look, your opinion now is much narrower
than the order, and we —
MR. LANDRY:

Wall, we haven't had to, Your Honor,

in the light of Mr. Justice Powell's stay, and in, of course,
the hope that this Court will provide us with the relief that
we're seeking.
I would just close out with the following?
With regard to Article 2351-1/2, two United States
District Courts have now abstained from deciding questions
involving the construction of that statute, albeit both were
Section (a) of the statute.
The Attorney General of Teras has now, with three
different advisory opinions, declared either section (a) or
section (c) unconstitutional under the State Constitution.
One Texas Court of Civil Appeals has actually
applied the statute.
The statute is just begging for a definitive
construction by the Texas.Supreme Court, and we would submit
that the proper disposition in this case would be for this
Court to reverse the judgment of the District Court and
remand the cause to that Court with the instructions to
abstain from deciding the case on the ground of abstention.
QUESTION? The trouble with that, Mr. Landry,
according to your brothers, is that there is no prompt way of

52
-— for getting a resolution, or construction under the Texas
Courts; that your Harris County Courts are terribly behind
and impeded, there's no provision for a declaratory judgment.
We heard all this, as you did, from your brothers today.
Do you differ with them on this?
MR. LANDRY:

I deffer very greatly, Your Honor.

There certainly is declaratory judgment provisions in the
Texas statutes.

I don't know which Courts that my adversary

counsel get — encounter —
QUESTION:

He represented to us professionally

that this would be a very long procedure.
MR. LANDRY:

There is no question that there may

be some delay, but it is not an unreasonable delay.
QUESTION:

Mr. Landry, a number of States now have

statutes which permit certification from a Federal Court to
their highest court of a State for the disposition of a
question of State law.
MR. LANDRY:

Does Texas have such a statute?
Your Honor, 1 —

QUESTION: A uniform statute on the subject.
MR. LANDRY:

— I simply do not know the answer to

the question.
QUESTION: Do you think this Court has inherent
powers to certify to a state whether it has a statute of
that kind or not?
MR. LANDRY:

Or haven't you given it any thought?
I have not given it any thought, Your

53
Honor, but I would certainly think that the Supreme Court of
the United States would have that kind of power.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Thank you, Mr. Landry.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:57 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
