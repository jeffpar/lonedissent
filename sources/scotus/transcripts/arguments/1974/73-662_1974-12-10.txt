MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 73-662, Schlesinger against Council­
man.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. BORK
FOR THE PETITIONERS
MR. BORK:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court

of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

The respondent, Captain

Councilman, is under court-martial charges for violating
Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the
general article, by wrongfully selling, transferring, and
possession marihuana.
At the time of the offense Captain Councilman was
off post, off duty and out of uniform.

Although stationed at

Fort Sill, Oklahoma, he was then in his apartment in Lawton,
Oklahoma.

The sale and transfer of marihuana were to a man

who Councilman believed to be an enlisted man also not in
uniform and off duty.
at Fort Sill.

He believed him to be a clerk-typist

He was in fact an enlisted undercover agent

for the Army's criminal investigation detachment which was
investigating a report that the captain used marihuana at his
apartment

4
Councilman moved to dismiss the charges against him
on the ground that the court-martial lacked jurisdiction
because the crimes were not service-connected under Q'Callahan
v. Parker.

The presiding military judge denied that motion

and Councilman then brought this action in the district court
which on the grounds of service connection permanently
enjoined the military authorities from proceeding with the
court-martial and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
This case puts in place two important issues.

The

first is the propriety of the district court's intervention
in a pending court-martial proceeding; the second is the
rationale and application of the service
court-martial jurisdiction.

connection test for

These are both issues of serious

concern to the Government for they bear directly upon the
effectiveness of the armed forces.
We submit, in the first place, that the district
court should not have interfered with this court-martial, and
the reasons for that conclusion are inter-related.

They are

the doctrines we discussed yesterday of comity and exhaustion
of remedy.
We have also contended that the finality provision
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 76, precludes
review by any mode other than a petition for habeas corpus.
Our arguments yesterday in McLucas v. DeChamplain
dealt with the principles of exhaustion of remedies and comity

5

and here as there we rely upon Younger v. Harris and Gusik v..
Schilder,

The military justice system is a coordinate judicial

system with a series of appellate stages through which any
conviction must be tested and strained.

The ordinary

considerations of avoiding duplication, waste of judicial
resources, and so forth, apply here 'as they did in Younger
and Gusik.
QUESTION:

Is your argument on this branch of the

case identical to the arguments you made in PeChamplain?
MR. BORK:

Virtually so, Mr. Justice Stewart,

except for one point, and that is that I wish to distinguish
the line of cases, Billings v. Truesdale, and Toth y. Quarles,
etc., because of the nature of the trial that is required on
a service connection issue.

I will not repeat the argument

about Younger v. Harris or Gusik v. Schllder in the ordinary
considerations.
QUESTION:

You are incorporating that by reference.

MR. BORK:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And then you have one additional argument,

is that it?
MR. BORK:

That is the nature of the trial "'required

on the service-connection issue.
QUESTION:

Or at least something additional you feel

you need to say in view of those cases, is that it?
MR. BORK:

Yes.

QUESTIONs

Isn't there a difference here in the

claim you can't try him at all?
MR. BQRK:

That is correct.

That is why I wish to

say that it is semantically possible, Mr. Justice Marshall,
to make this case sound as i f it were similar to Toth v_. Quarles
or Reid v. Covert or that line of cases, because it can be
put in terms that the question is the military's power to try
the man.
I think it's quite different from those cases
because in those cases the military's lack of power to try the
man comes from his status and not from his conduct.
a quite simple trial.

And it's

In fact, it's solely a legal issue

whether the man is a civilian or a military man.

Whether if

he is a civilian, the military has a constitutional power to
try him.
Here, however, the question of the power to try him —
and it's quite different, I think, when a man is not a civilian
but is a military man v/ho is ordinarily subject to military
discipline and military jurisdiction,

and in addition, when

the claim that he may not be tried rests upon the factual
details of what he did and where he did it and so forth it.
Because that means that when the service-connection issue is
raised, if he can go into a Federal district court, in many
cases there should be a small trial of the crime to get out the
details.

In fact, I think in this case it may be that this

7

stipulation is seriously inadequate, I don't know.

If

district .courts are going to come into these cases, 1 will
advise U.S. attorneys and military lawyers to make much fuller
records, than this so we can find out about service connection
much more effectively.
QUESTION:

You consider it of particular importance

that this was a transaction between a captain and an enlisted
man who is under his command?
MR. BORK:

I consider that of crucial importance

on the service connection issue, Mr. Chief Justice.

On the

jurisdictional issue, however, I don’t think that it bears
as directly.
QUESTION %

Even though they were off base and out

of uniform.
MR. BORK:

Well, by the jurisdictional issue I meant

initially whether a district court ought ever to entertain
a claim like this before the military process has run its
course.
not.

And I think on the service connection issue it ought

I think this clearly is service connected, and I will

argue to that effect in a moment, but I wish to complete the
answer to Mr. Justice Marshall's question.
If you may go into a civilian court in advance of a
court-martial, the civilian court in many cases will have to
hear the facts of the crime to determine the service connection
issue.

If the civilian court determines it is service

3

connected, you will then go bade for a full military trial.
You will have two trials, one civilian and one military.

If

the civilian court determines it is not service connected,
you will then have two civilian trials, one on the injunctive
action and one presumably when the local prosecutor brings a
charge under the criminal law, the civilian criminal law.
So I think there is quite a waste of resources in
this kind of a service connection case which is necessarily
a factual case.

If you elect to proceed to the military, then

you need have only one trial of the facts, and a court looking
at it on habeas corpus later on the service connection issue
may rely upon the military record.
In addition to that there is in the service connection
issue necessarily an expert judgment about the effect of the
behavior upon the discipline, the morale, the effectiveness of
the armed, forces.

And I think that judgment initially should

be made and illuminated by a military tribunal with the-,
expertise.

It may then be reviewed on habeas corpus by s.

civilian court with the issue so illuminated.
I think that is why this case is a very different
kind of a case, both in terms of expertise and in terms of
trial of factual matters than the Toth v. Quarles or Billings v.
Truesdale line of cases, and why ‘the doctrine of exhaustion
of remedies and comity is particularly appropriate hers.
Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you mentioned the issue

9

raised in this case by the fact that the marihuana sale and
transfer charges involve the sale and transfer of marihuana
by an officer, Captain Councilman, to a man whom he knew to
be an enlisted man and the enlisted man, he knew, understood
him to be an officer»

I think that makes the first two charges

in this case quite clearly service connected.
0*Callahan v. Parker and Re1fora v. Commandant were
cases which explicate a number of the criteria that are
relevant in judging service connection.

But the Relford opinion

explicitly recognises that those factors are not a closed sat,
that's not a codification, that there's a common law develop­
ment in this field.

And I think the 0'Callahan case indicates

the rationale which guides that common law development of these
cases. It grows out of Congress' constitutional power which
exists because the exigencies of military discipline required
the existence of special courts with special expertise and
special, jurisdiction.
So I think an offense is service connected when it
bears upon discipline, morale, and toe effectiveness of the
armed forces and when the armed forces have a reason of their
own which is distinct from that held in common with civilian
society to be so seriously concerned about the offense.
that's certainly true here.

And

The rationale of service connec­

tion, indeed,'! think is very similar to the rationale of
Article 134 under which Captain Councilman is charged.

10
Article 134 prohibits all disorders and neglect to the
prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.
So both issues, the jurisdictional and the substantive,
service connection and disorders and neglects, are given meaning
by the unique nature of the special needs and the vital mission
of the military.
QUESTION:

Are you, in speaking of the differences

between this kind of an offense in a military society contrasted
to what it would be in a civilian society, are you concentrating
on the military's attitude toward the possession and use of
marihuana or are you concentrating on the -— emphasizing the
traditions in the military that officers and enlisted men do
not fraternize?
MR. BORK:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, those two

rationales correspond to the different charges.

I was

addressing initially the relationship of officer to enlisted
man and the destructive impact of shared criminal behavior
upon that relationship.
QUESTION:

Shared behavior of any kind, unless times

have changed since I was in the military.
MR. BORK:

Well, I wouldn't quite say shared behavior

of any kind, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Off duty, except in the military mission: .

MR. BORK:

That's true.

I think the service connection becomes particularly

IX
apparent when the shared behavior is criminal behavior and
known to be such by both participants, because X think that
is particularly destructive to morale and as word of it
spreads around, as it will when an officer engages in this
kind of behavior, destructive to the authority of all officers
in that command or indeed in other commands that hear about it
But I intend to address as well the fact that
possession of marihuana, irrespective of the relationship to
the enlisted man is also service connected.
QUESTION?

Two distinct differences.

MR. BORKs

Two distinct rationales, both of which X

think apply to this case, and both of which I think uphold
service connection.
We have just discussed that it’s hardly relevant
to the destructive impact of shared criminal behavior between
an officer and enlisted man whether it takes place on post or
off post or in or out of uniform or on or off duty.

The

relationship between those men is effectively destroyed.

As

word gets back in this closed society which the military is,
very close-knit society, a society in which there is a great
deal of gossip and rumor, it will undercut the authority of
all officers in that command.

And I think one need not strain

one’s imagination to think of a variety of criminal offenses
that are wholly destructive of the relationship the armed
forces must require.

In fact, there may be such offenses

12

which are criminal under the .Uniform Code which are not
criminal under a State code.

So that if it occurs in certain

jurisdictions, civilian authorities will be without power to
prosecute.

But the military, nevertheless, has a vital interest

in seeing that that kind of behavior does not take place
between officers and enlisted men.

And I think that much can

hardly be denied.
QUESTION;

What if this had been an alcoholic

beverage instead of marihuana?
MR. BORK:

I think fraternizing with an enlisted

man might have called for disciplinary activity by the
military.

I don't think it would have been a general court.

I think drinking with enlisted men is severely discouraged?
it might have called for a reprimand; if repeated, it might
have called for

a

more serious punishment, but since the

Underlying activity is not in itself criminal, the initial
response of the military, I suspect, would have been milder
than this.
QUESTION;

You feel there are differences between

drunkenness and grass?
MR. BORK;

A distinction?

No, no.

I think the

distinction between alcohol and drugs is simply that, if we
are talkxng about the use rather than the relationship between
the two men is simply that the military, as civilian society,
chooses to regard only overuse of alcohol as an offense, whereas

13
they tend to regard any use of drugs as an offense.

And that’s

a judgment which I think is essentially a legislative judgment
and I think an allowable one.
QUESTION:

Well, you mentioned just a moment ago

that we might be in a jurisdiction where the use of marihuana
was not a crime.
MR. BORK:

That is correct.

In fact, we have

jurisdictions now, I think *— well, one thing is certainly
true, Mr., Justice Blackmun, and that is that the treatment of
marihuana possession or use by various localities and States
varies enormously.
15 years for

There are — we have heard of cases where

possession of minor amounts of marihuana.

There

are other jurisdictions where the offense is almost not
prosecuted.

So that the military's distinctive interest in

this may be not vindicated at all by the civilian authorities,
or it may be overvindicated in some sense, be much harsher
than the military would choose to treat the matter.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you, however, to say that

if the captain here had gone off base, off duty and spent the
evening in an apartment with an enlisted man and they both
hung one on that this would not be service connected?
MR. BORK:
Blackmun.

No, no, I didn't suggest that, Mr. Justice

I think it would be.

I was suggesting that the

service's respcnse to an officer having a drink with an
enlisted man might be not at the same level of concern and

might justify a milder level of punishment than its response
to an activity which is itself criminal and the use of a drag,
although it might have a disciplinary response to fraternisation
between an officer and an enlisted man.

But fraternisation in

a criminal activity is a far more serious form of
fraternisation and far more destructive of morale and
discipline than other forms of fraternisation.
QUESTION:

Because in this case if the captain had

a bottle of whiskey, nothing would have happened to him, but
if he had marihuana, he would have been prosecuted, without
any association with anybody.
MR. BGEK:

If we are talking about the possession

issue alone, that is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.

The

possession of marihuana is certainly treated as a crime by
the military, whereas the possession of alcohol is not.
QUESTION:

Whether with anybody else or not.

QUESTION:

Is fraternisation itself a crime under

MR. BORK:

No, I think only if it reaches a level

the UCMJ?

where it does become destructive of discipline? I suspect that
fraternization which was regarded as unseemly would bs handled
by a word to the officer»

Fraternization which becomes

destructive of the relationship which the military

must

foster will ultimately reach a criminal level in that sense.
Fraternisation which involves participation in a criminal

15
activity is obviously a crime.
But X wanted to reach the issue of possession because •
I may say on the other issue of it, when it is behavior between
an officer and an enlisted man that is criminal, the civilian
court will never fully vindicate the military’s interest because
there is no element of any civilian crime which consists of
the discipline-destroying aspect of tills relationship.
Now, the charge of possession, X think, is equally
serious and X think equally service connected.

The military

regard the use of drugs as highly detrimental to effective
military performance.
That is hard to say.

They may not be in any individual case.
On the average the military have good

reason to know that the use of drugs is highly destructive
of the efficacy of the armed forces.
Now, it may be that a variety of civilian jurisdic­
tions will

ultimate decriminalise marihuana.

many of them won’t.

It may be that

The military cannot afford to decriminalize

marihuana because they think, on the basis of experience,
on the basis of evidence, that the drug tends to decrease
efficacy and that cannot be tolerated by an army —
QUESTION;

Wouldn’t alcohol also?

MR. BORIC;

It will if overused, yes.

QUESTION;

This was off base, wasn’t it?

MR. BORIC:

That is true, Mr. Justice Stewart, but

I suspect that — I am sure that the impact of the drug on

16

personal well-being is the same whether you are in uniform or
out of uniform or on base or off base.
QUESTIONS

The same is true of alcohol, isn’t it?

MR. BORKs

That is true,

An abuse of alcohol is

a military offense Off base or on base.

The military regards

that as an offense.
QUESTION:

Do you not have the related factor that

comes into this picture, then, somewhere, if enlisted men
generally get the impression that the officers tolerate the
use of marihuana or the drugs, which would go to your broadbased argument about maintenance of discipline, would it not?
MR. BORK:

That’s right, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think

one must look at this as a widespread problem in the army.
This is not a problem of Captain Councilman and a few of his
off-duty paccdillos.

This is a serious, widespread concern to

the military.
Now, I think at page 17 of our brief, to illustrate
the problem, we have some figures which show how serious the
problem is, on page 17 and running over onto page 18.

That

brief states that in two years over 86,000 servicemen undement
rehabilitation for drug use, and that 48 percent of those were
unable to return to active duty.

Now, that means something

like a little over 40,000 men in two years were lost to the
army, or the armed forces, through drug use.

And that is the

equivalent of two army divisions being lost without a shot being

17
fired.

Arid that's the kind of problem we are talking about

and the kind of problem the military faces.

A civilian society

in balancing its values may decide it doesn't care about
efficiency, about effectiveness, and that what an individual
does to himself is his own concern.

And there may be a good

deal to be said for that.
QUESTION;
referred to drug use.
MR. BORIC;
confine it to that.

Mr. Boric, I notice you have consistently
Isn't this a marihuana case?
Yes, a marihuana

case.

Perhaps I should

But marihuana, the military thinks, ' as

many people think, has some relationship, and net a perfect
one, but then again not an insignificant one, to other drug
use.

And in itself it is increasingly thought to be harmful.

It is particularly thought to be harmful to motivation.
QUESTION;

There is some thinking that alcohol also

does the same thing.
MR. BQRK:
correct.

Fir. Justice Biackmun, I think that's

I think it’s fundamentally a mistake for us to think

that if a society has learned to tolerate alcohol over a
period of years and punish only its severe abuse in the
military, that it then becomes somehow unconstitutional or
illegal for that society to make a different judgment about,
marihuana tvhose effects in some respectsmay be similar, in
some respects may be different.

But I think it’s an allowable

legislative judgment that on the basis of present knowledge

IS
and on the basis of the experience we have# marihuana may be
regarded by any jurisdiction# civilian or military# as a more
serious threat.
allowably.

The military so regards it, and I think

In fact, I think much of the contrary feeling to

my own about this case rests upon an unarticulated notion that
perhaps marihuana ought to be decriminalized.

I don't know

whether marihuana ought to be decriminalized or not.

I do

think that the judgment for each jurisdiction involved# and the
military has made its judgment# and I think it's a very
reasonable judgment for the military to make and therefore one
that ought not to be upset.
This is a massive problem for the milit&xy.

They

have lost a great deal of efficiency and loss of personnel

So I think both —

MR. BORK;

QUESTION:

On Review of Military Drug and Alcohol

MR. BORK:

I am not quite certain why the subject

of alcohol rises here because the military does concern itself

19

with the abuse of alcohol.
QUESTION:

Unless again times have changed, one

branch of the military, i.e., United States Navy, concerns
itself not only with the abuse of alcohol, but with any
possession of any kind of alcohol on any ship

in the United

States Navy.
MR. BORK%
Justice Stewart.

Aboard ship, that's certainly true, Mr.

But I think the Navy would take the position

that drug possession off base, out of uniform, is service
connected, whereas alcohol possession off base out of
uniform, they would not regard as service connected.

I think

that's an allowable legislative distinction, allowable
judgment.

It's one that our society generally makes, and 2

don't see why it should be denied to the military, and 1 think
indeed it’s justified.
For these reasons I think both because of the
relationship between the officer and the enlisted man in a
known criminal transaction which the civilian courts cannot
fully vindicate, and the possession issue, which I think the
military is entitled to view as service connected because of
its disastrous effect upon efficiency and upon availability
of manpower as shown by statistics, I think both of these
offenses, if the merits of this case are reached, contrary
to our submission that the district court had no jurisdiction,
require that the judgment be reversed.

there may not be one.
QUESTION:

Do you know of any military case holding

that marihuana possession is not service connected?

In general, military courts

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Garrett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS D. GARRETT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GARRETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Members of the Court:

I think myself — the Court has

22

granted a split argument in this case, myself and Mr. Meyers.
He will address himself to the issue of jurisdiction; I will
attempt to address myself to the issue of service connection
as applied to 011 Callahan and Re.1 ford and related cases.
I think that the Solicitor General has maybe over­

stated his case to one extent, and that we will soon have through
the use of the military agents the service manufacturing
jurisdiction, and as Justice Blackmun has pointed out, we nov;
have a si.tuat.ion where the courts of military appeals chains
have uniformly held that possession is per se service connected.
And I would suggest that I don't believe that that was the
holding of either Re1ford or 0'Callahan wherein the individual
rights seemed to be at stake in 0j Callahan where we had the
flagrant use of the military deciding jurisdiction was available,
where the only thing was that he was a member of the service.
There was no other service connection in attempted rape off
post,off duty, out of uniform.
The Relford case, t think, tried to limit or at
least to explain some of the factors that the military should
look at in/

determining whether or not service connection lies.

And 1 think that we find that the military has just by some
means determined that marihuana is per se service connected.
If you apply any of the factors set out in 08 Callahan or in
Relford, you reach a different conclusion.

The only factor

that -the Relford decision would point to service connection

23
in this case, the Councilman case would be that of victim.
..

Kiau'wii.Mbi »'i«o

And I might suggest that in this case I am not sure that victim
was the kind of victim that 0* Callahan spoke of and that
Pelford may have addressed . itself to.

That is to say, this

victim is not engaged in any military activity or duty.

This

victim is an undercover agent who is holding himself out by
the use of an alias.

In the facts in this thing, Councilman

liras invited to a party for the very purpose of having met this
undercover agent who was held out to be not an undercover
agent, but as a clerk-typist.
Now, we would then have the Army stretching this thing
if they stretch it much further to the point that they have
reached the fact that if a government instrumentality used,
then they may decide this is jurisdiction.

I know that the

military courts of appeal have uniformly held that it is
service connection, and I can only suggest that after the Array
has all the facts before it, as it did in this case,by virtue
of the 32 hearing which is a hearing prior to 39a hearing where
the evidence is adduced, then at the 39a hearing the Government
called witnesses and more evidence was adduced, and although
the facts in this case are very limited because they are
reached by stipulation, they are the entire facts and there
will never be any change in the factual circumstance/ .

The

Government called witnesses in 39a, and if they were present
at the hearing before the district judge, and if there were to

24
be additional facts that would be presented, 1 would sue jest
they certainly would have called witnesses before the district
judge or would have caused me to enter into another stipulation
as they did in this instance and as attached to the brief in
this matter.
QUESTION:

Mr. Garrett, I am not sure that I under­

stand — perhaps I misunderstood your emphasis on the fact
that this was a clerk-typist but known to the captain as a
member of the military force.
MR. GARRETT:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

Yes.

Would it have made any difference to your

case if he had been a lieutenant, first lieutenant, second
lieutenant instead of a clerk-typist, an enlisted man?
MR. GARRETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't draw that

I don? t know if that answers

Perhaps you are getting at the. issue that it is

a dealing between an officer and an enlisted man, and I can
only suggest that the whole offense, if the service connection
test v;e have means anything, we. are dealing in a society that
is ■— I mean, the factual situation, everything, both people
involved, the "victim" and Captain Councilman, everything took
place in an area outside of the reservation.

And he was not.

25
tills agent was not, under the command of Captain Councilman
as far as active duty on base.

Captain Councilman was going to

school out there, and, of course, the undercover agent was sent
for the purpose of this.
QUESTION:

Are you, or is your colleague, going to

address the jurisdictional question?
MR. GARRETT:

Yes, sir.

I think perhaps the Court has fairly

well covered

by questioning those items that seem to me to be important in
this case, and that is to say that public drunkenness is a
crime cognizable in the military and in the civilian courts,
and yet vie do not see soldiers that become drunk in civilian
communities dragged into the military system and court-martialed.
Yet we see this happening in several instances, or in
numerous instances, in the case of marihuana.
Mow, it seems to me we are applying a different
standard, and I don’t think that that is a proper standard
where they can then ignore by selective prosecution the criteria
laid down by Relford and 0’Callahan.
QUESTION:

Suppose the captain gave a party and

invited a dozen enlisted men and they all made very excessive
use of alcohol and ultimately the party went public and you
had a public —- the public drunkenness criminal act you are
talking about, do you think that might conceivably be different
from the private party?

26
MR. GARRETT:

I think if the party reached such

proportions as the Court envisions where they spew out into
the street and -they are off post* then I think that then we
would apply the Re1ford test to see if perhaps there there was
service connection in your fact situation.

And there may be

that in that instance/ again depending on the facts, there
may be service connection enough . for the bringing of a
court-martial.
QUESTION:

Possession of marihuana does not need

to be in public in order to be a criminal act/ does it?
MR. GARRETT;

NO/ it does not.

It is against the

lav; both in Oklahoma and in the military to possess
marihuana.

I think there again, either in that instance or

your first case involving public drunkenness, I think we need
to apply the test in Ralford, and it may be that in applying
the test in the public drunkenness case, we might have a
basis.
But as far as detrimental effect and the broad
argument that the Solicitor General was using in terms of
use of marihuana having a detrimental effect, why, I am sure
that alcohol has more than a detrimental effect in a sense.
That is to say, that probably alcohol is a more severe
problem in the Army than is marihuana.
QUESTION:

Mr. Garrett, how many times in your

experience have these civilian courts in your State taken over

27

a case of drunkenness of a military person, public drunkenness?
Many times?
MR. GARRETT:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

Don't they always turn it over to the

military authorities?
MR. GARRETT:

No, they do not.

We live in a military

community, and public drunk charges are brought against the
soldiers in our town I would suggest at least a hundred over
the payday periods, and they are treated as any other civilian
would be in the city courts, and then the record is released
back to the military, the fact that he was confined in our
civilian courts,

But, of course, then there is no jeopardy

attaches and the only thing they than do is make a note
administratively in his serviceman’s file.
QUESTION:

They will be sentenced for 10 days to

county jail?
MR, GARRETT:

Actually, as a practical matter, in our

court it’s a $25 to $50 fine in the civilian community for
public drunkenness.
QUESTION:

Where is this — Port Sill?

MR. GARRETT:

Fort Sill — the community is Lawton,

Oklahoma.
QUESTION:

Doefe that

prevent the army .Ixom moving

in afterwards?
MR. GARRETT:

Yes, it does,

if there is a conviction

23
in the civilian courts.
QUESTIONS

It does?

MR. GARRETTs

Other than administratively.

They make

a note in a man’s file.
QUESTIONS

Is that some agreement or something with

Lawton?
MR. GARRETT;

No, sir? that's just — there is no

way that they can try him again in the military for what tool'.
place — I mean, if he is tried in the civilian courts.
QUESTION;

After he is tried.

MR. GARRETT;

After he is tried or after he pleads

guilty.
QUESTION;

But the military could take him, couldn't

they, before trial?
MR. GARRETT;
QUESTION;

Yes, they could.

They never have.

Well, they just waived it.

They still

have the right.
QUESTION:
could.

You had better not concede that they

You are giving away your case if you do.
MR. GARRETT;

Well, I am not sure that they could

just come in and take him and try him.

That is certainly an

off-post offense without any service connection, unless we
completely change where we are.
QUESTION;

Is the possession of marihuana off th©

post, is that an offense?

You agree that is a military offense?

29

MR. GARRSTTs
QUESTIONS

What?

The possession of marihuana while a

mamver of the military force anyplace.
MR. GARRETT:

No? only if it. takes place within the

confines of the bass.
QUESTION s

And where do yon get that from?

ME. GARRETT:

Well, it seems to ir«e -— I can say

definitely if he possesses marihuana on base, that is a
military offense.

Then it seems to me we have then the next,

if a serviceman possesses marihuana off base, out of uniform,
off duty, then it seems to me we have the other side of the
coin, the military does not have jurisdiction.

And then I

think as we apply the Re.1 ford factors to that, I think that
maybe we may reach whether they do or don't have jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

We weren't dealing with a drug in any of

the otiier cases.
MR. GARRETT:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I don't understand, SIR.

We weren't dealing with drugs in any of

the other cases, were we?
MR. GARRETT:
08Callahan?

Oh, in the other cases.

Re1ford and

No, sir, and I don't think —

QUESTION:

We weren't dealing with drugs.

But now

■»

we are dealing with drugs which the military decided is just
bad, unlawful, and should be stopped.
MR. GARRETT:

I am not sure that the military —* I am

30

not sure that the use of drugs or that the military can say
that this crime, marihuana, is a different type crime than
any other crime.

In other words, I don't see how we can

ascribe some different status to marihuana
QUESTIONS

Possession of money is no crime.

possession of marihuana is.

Of course that's true.

The
If it's

your own money.
MR. GARRETT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

So they could make possession of certain

substances a crime, and dope is one, narcotics is one, and
marihuana is one.

You don-t say they can't make that a crime

to possess it/ do you?

You

only say they can't make it a

crime to be caught in the possession of it off the base.
MR. GARRETT:

No.

It's a crime to possess

marihuana in the military.

It's a crime to possess marihuana

in the civilian community.

But in the issue of jurisdiction

it seems to me• -- or service connection — it seems to me
that there has to be something more than mere possession off
post for the military to now say, "We have jurisdiction/'
QUESTION:

Like what?

MR. GARRETTs

Captain Councilman in this case had

mere possession off post.
QUESTION;

He picks an enlisted man and makes a

deal to sell him marihuana.

If he had sold it to a civilian,

you might have a different case.

You might.

But here is an

31
officer,knowing his rank and knowing the enlisted man5 s rank,
selling him marihuana, knowing that they are both military
people and knowing their rank.

You don't see any problem with

the military?
MR, GARRETT: Not in terms of the factual situation
in this case.

There is not a victim as such.

This is an

undercover agent that is holding himself out to be a military
man.

If we carry that argument further, it seems to me we

then have, if we have a civilian agent that holds himself out
to be an undercover agent, then he in that instance would be -—
they would find service connection.

I think that's the foggiest

interpretation — the example I gave is the foggiest interpreta­
tion of Re1ford and 0'Callahan.
If the Court please, I see my time has expired,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your colleague is going to

deal with jurisdiction.
MR. GARRETT:

Yes, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Meyers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF 0. CHRISTOPHER MEYERS
ON BEHAI,F OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MEYERSs
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This portion of our argument is devoted to the

question of the propriety of the Federal district court
injunction of the pending court-martial.

Our argument here

is predicated on tills Court finding that, there is no service

32
connection on these facts.

If the Court does find that there

is sufficient service connection to allow a court-martial
prosecution in the off-post, out of uniform,, off duty, et
cetera, possession and transfer of marihuana, then it is true,
and 2 would agree, that Captain Councilman should stand trial
by court-martial.
If, however, you agree that there was not sufficient
service connection here and that if Captain Councilman is to
be tried, he should be tried by civilian authorities instead
of military authorities, then a court-martial has no jurisdic­
tion and has no authority at all to try this man.

And we

have, therefore, no duty to exhaust our remedies within the
military system.
Now, this Court —
QUESTION:

We are not talking about the merits of

the — I mean, the jurisdictional question, I think, doesn81
depend on the ultimate merits of your claim, does it?

It

depends upon whether or not every single court-martial can be
tested out in advance in a Federal district court by way of
the puted defendant, the court-martial defendant, bringing
as a plaintiff an action for an injunction.
MR. MEYERS:
Stewart.

I did intend to reach that, Mr. Justice

The way that I intend to reach it is to develop,

first of all, where the military has the jurisdiction to try
an individual for a particular offense.

As I was saying, this

33

Court has set out in the O’Callahan opinion a two-step inquiry
to determine whether the military court has jurisdiction in the
first place to try a person. And this two-step inquiry requires
asking the question, first of all, is this individual subject
to the Uniform Code of Military Justice?

And if that question

be answered in the affirmative, then the second question arises,
the second question beings

Is this particular offense which is

alleged here sufficiently service connected to allow the
military court to have jurisdiction?
Now, unless both of these questions be answered in
the affirmative, then the military court has no jurisdiction
in the first place to try an individual.

The question then

arises if an individual finds himself in this position, that
is, about to be deprived of his rights and tried by the
military when the military has no jurisdiction, then what does
he do?

And the collateral question, of course, is whether

or not the individual must exhaust his remedies within the
military system before he can even raise the matter whether
or not the court-martial has jurisdiction.
QUESTIONS

Well, another way to put it, it really is

whether or not a Federal district court has any jurisdiction
at all over this kind of a claim, or whether the only function
of the civilian court is to deal with habeas corpus applications.
MR. MEYERS;

I think that whether the civilian

court has jurisdiction at all and when the jurisdiction of

34
the civilian court arises depends upon whether or not the
military court has jurisdiction.

It is my position if the

military court has jurisdiction, then the civilian court can
stay out of it.

However ~

QUESTION:

And it’s up to the civilian court in an

action for an injunction to determine that question, you say.
MR. MEYERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, the civilian court —
This would mean that in every single

case where there is a threatened court-martial the defendant
can come into a Federal district court and try this question
out in the Federal district court in an action for an
injunction to enjoin the military court-martial, is that
right?
MR. MEYERS:

1 think that's not correct, although

I would say, certainly, an individual always maintains his
constitutional rights and always the civilian courts stand
ready to protect his constitutional rights if they are
infringed.
QUESTION:
MR. MEYERS:
QUESTION:
MR. MEYERS:

What cases do you have?
In Toth y. Quarles —
Was that an injunctive proceeding?
That was a habeas corpus proceeding.

And in Toth v. Quarles the man who, as you recall, had been
discharged from the Army was returned to Korea and tried for
murder

35

This Court,, applying the two-step test found,

Q.K.,

service connection, murder in the Army, but the individual was
not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, therefore,
both steps were not met, therefore the military does not have
jurisdiction, therefore we do not require the exhaustion of
remedies and habeas corpus is a proper relief.
QUESTION:

But that was after he had been tried.

The

military proceedings were all over in Toth when he —
MR. MEYERS:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The man was

taken from Pennsylvania, I believe, back to Korea to stand
trial for murder.

And before the military could proceed with

the murder trial, the matter was raised by habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

That’s correct, it wa3 a pretrial habeas

corpus♦
MR. MEYERS:

I think you are referring to the facts

in Gusik.
QUESTION:

I was thinking of Reid v. Covert actually,

QUESTION:

Those were close convictions.

I think.

MR. MEYERS:

Reid v. Covert was a situation where

a military dependent stood accused1 of murdering her serviceman
husband.

Again, this Court, applying the two-step test, found

O.K. service connection for killing the fellow, but the first
step fails because the wife was not subject to the Uniform
Code of Military Justice.

Therefore, this Court did not

36

require exhaustion of remedies, habeas corpus was relieved.
QUESTIONS

But there in Held the trial had taken

place, hadn’t it, in the military?
MR. MEYERSt

X believe not.

Habeas corpus was the

remedy, and this Court did not require the exhaustion of
remedies in Reid.
QUESTIONS

Well, in any rate, in Reid the person

was a civilian, were they not?
MR. MEYERS:

In Reid the parson was a civilian, the

wife of the serviceman whom she murdered.
QUESTION:
MR. MEYERS:

And the action was won for habeas corpus.
That’s correct.

The third case along these lines is McE.I.roy v.
Guagliardo

where civilian employees of the military were

accused of stealing military property.

Again, the second part

of the test, that is, service connection, is probably present,
however, the people were found not to be subject to the Uniform
Code of Military Justice, therefore, exhaustion was not required
and the military could not proceed habeas corpus.
QUESTION:
MR, MEYERS:

Was that an injunction?
No, sir.

Habeas corpus was the remedy

as well.
QUESTION:

Except for the case we heard yesterday

and Avrech, are there any other cases where injunction has been
concerned?

37
MR. MEYERS:

I do have a case, Dooley v. Ploger, a

Fourth Circuit case.
QUESTION:
MR. MEYERS:

It's not in your brief, is it?
Dooley v. Ploger, I believe, is cited

in the Government’s brief and also in the amici briefs.
Excuse me.

That should have been Sedivy v. Richardson.

That case was a case involving off-post, off-duty possession
of marihuana.

The Circuit Court said that injunctive relief

in -that case was not proper and the reason was that the facts
were not clearly presented to the military court, so that the
military court never had the opportunity to determine whether
or not there was service connection.

And that, I submit, is

a significant distinction between the Sedivy case and the
facts which are now before this Court.
QUESTION:

The way you explained it, that was sort of

a decision-on-the-merits case.

The Federal civilian court

didn’t refrain from entertaining jurisdiction, the way you
explained it, but just denied the injunction, is that it?
MR. MEYERS:
martial proceedings.

The district court enjoined the courtThe Circuit Court said the injunction was

not proper —
QUESTION:
MR, MEYERS:

On the merits.
On the merits — because the military

did not have a chance to develop the facts in that particular
case.

33

QUESTION;

But the Court of Appeals did not say, as

you have explained it to us, that the district court was
without jurisdiction to consider the merits, did it?
MR. MEYERS;

That is my understanding of the case.

I would like to continue the line that I had started
on the two-step inquiry.

Gusik, I believe, is the case that

you are referring to, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in which the
person charged was in the military.

He had already gone through

several trials for murder, and he brought the action to this
Court asking for habeas corpus, and at that time a new type of
relief was passed'by statute, I believe.

This Court required

him to then go back and exhaust all of those remedies, I think
properly so, because applying the two-step inquiry, one, the
•.

person was subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
and, two, the offenses he committed, murder of another service­
man in the service, certainly w'ould satisfy the service
connection.

So on both points of the two-step inquiry, it

points toward military jurisdiction, and I think in that
situation a man should be required to exhaust all his military
remedies.
This was basically the same situation in Noyd v. Bond
in which an officer refused orders to teach pilots, to train
pilots, for duty in Vietnam.

Here, applying the two-step

inquiry, we find a captain in the Army on active duty subject
to the Uniform Code refusing an order, certainly a service-

39
connected offense.

The Court properly held then, that the man

should be required to exhaust bis military remedies.
The Court also pointed out that in Moyd v. Bond there
was a particular question as to a. technical interpretation of
the language in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

In a

footnote in Moyd v. Bond this Court cited Toth, Reid., and McElroy?
the cases I've just discussed, pointing out that this Court
had vindicated the claim of individuals without requiring
exhaustion, of military remedies.

The reason:

That this

Court did not believe that the expertise of the military
extended to the consideration of the types of constitutional
claims there presented, and moreover, it appeared especially
unfair to require exhaustion of military remedies where the
complainant raised substantial arguments denying the right of
the military to try them at all.

And I believe that's where

we are here today as well.
QUESTION:
MR. .MEYERS:
Honor.

This man .is in the military.
He is in the military, I agree, your

us here.
QUESTION:
MR. MEYERS:

Step one.

Uniform Code of Military Justice?

Is this man subject to the
Certainly.

He's a captain

on active duty in the Army.
Is this offense sufficiently service connected to

allow court-martial jurisdiction?

We feel that based on this

Court’s opinion in 0’Callahan and Re1ford, applied to the
facts in this situation, this offense is clearly not sufficiently
service connected to allow the military to try this man.
Now, we don't say he shouldn't be tried.

What we

say is he should be tried in the civilian court for his
Article III and fifth and sixth amendment rights.
QUESTION:

Suppose one of the other people that

Councilman sold heroin to brought it back onto the post.

Would

that be military then?
MR. MEYERS:

Let me point out first, Dir. Justice

Marshall, that we are dealing with marihuana and not heroin.
Now, if Captain Counci3jiian or an individual service­
man off post, off duty, out of uniform sells some controlled
substance to another person and just by selling it to another
person, certainly he's committed a crime, but he should be
tried in the civilian courts.

If the person to whom he sails

it —

MR. MEYERS:

If he brings it back onto the post -Then the second man has committed the

service-connected offense.

QUESTION: /Councilman sells marihuana at the po3t

on this side of the gate? it's service connected; if he sells
it on the other side of the gats? it’s not.
MR. MEYERS:

Yes or no«

Your Honor? I think the answer to that

would have, to be yes, all other things being equa.t.
QUESTION:

Why do you say that this is a proper

matter for a civilian court when the civil authorities turned
your man over to the military authorities?

This is a fact

in your case? is it not?
MR. MEYERS:
QUESTION;

It is a fact? Mr. Justice Blackraun.
This doesn’t jibe with your co-counsel's

statement that your local Oklahoma courts are taking care of
these things day by day.

My experience has been? my impression

anyway? is that the average civilian court is eager to have
the military take care of their own problems.
MR. MEYERS:

Not in this situation.

The military

courts were fully open for the trial of this particular type
of offense.
QUESTION;

The civilian authorities turned him over

to the military? didn’t want tc have anything to do with him.
MR. MEYERS:

They did.

The civilian authorities

did turn him over to the military, not? I think, because they
didn't want anything to do with him — I don't know why they
did it.

But I merely say that I know that on many? many

occasions the military people are tried in the civilian courts
for just this type of offense.

It is certainly not the

42

practice of the civilian authorities to turn over people to
the military simply because they are in the military for
offenses which the military person commits in a civilian
community.

Civilian authorities try them regularly.
QUESTION:

Ilow many times do you think at Newport

News do the Virginia courts try public drunkenness of sailors
on shore leave?
MR. MEYERS:
QUESTION:

I have no idea.
The situation is different in Fort Sill.

MR. MEYERS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, 1 assure you the

situation is different in Fort Sill.

It is the rule that if

a serviceman commits —
QUESTION;

If it’s a rule, they wouldn’t have txirned

him over to the military courts in this case.
MR. MEYERS:

The military authorities in this

particular case particularly requested that Captain Councilman
be turned over to them, and I think that the reason is this is
a captain, this is an unusual situation, at least it was to
the military, that a captain would be having something to do
with marihuana.

I think that’s perhaps the only —

QUESTION:

(Inaudible»)

MR. MEYERS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Is there some basis for thinking that

officers are less prone to use marihuana than enlisted men?
MR. MEYERS:

I don’t know the answer to that question.

43
I don't know why the military thinks the way they do.

But X

merely observe that this is what happened.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Meyers, what about the stipulation

that many of the military offenders apprehended for drug sales
and transfers to scags in the civilian community have been
tried by the civilian authorities but some have been tried by
the military?
MR. MEYERS r,

I merely say —■ there were three

captains involved in this particular case.
QUESTION;

They are not talking about this particular

case, are they?
MR.MEYERS;

case —■
QUESTION;

QUESTION;

That is correct, your Honor.
Who made the decision of which ones

he

gave to the civilian and which ones he gave to the military?
MR. MEYERS;

The military.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
do you have anything further?

Mr. Solicitor General,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OS' ROBERT H. BORK
ON BEHALF OF THE .PETITIONERS
MR. BORKs

Mr, Chief Justice, I just wish to respond

more fully to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question about the cases.
At the time you asked me, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I was perfectly
accurate in saying I did not know of any cases.

The situation

has changed.
On pages 14 and 15 of the Government's brief, in
footnote 4, running over from page 14 to 15, there is
citation of some civilian courts that have held drug offenses
off post, including a marihuana offense, to be service
connected.

And in the amicus brief filed by the American

Civil Liberties Union, on page 14, there is an instance where
one military judge held a marihuana offense not to be service
connected.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
