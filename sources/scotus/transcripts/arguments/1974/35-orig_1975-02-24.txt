FROCEEDI N G S
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

next in No., 35 Original, United States against the State of
Maine.
Mr. Clagett? you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRICE M. CLAGETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR. CLAGETT:

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it please

the Court:
The question before the Court this afternoon is
related to? but a great deal broader than? the question you
heard this morning.
The question this afternoon is whether it is the
plaintiff? the United States? or the twelve defendant States
which own the natural resources of the Outer Continental
Shelf in the Atlantic Ocean» beyond internal waters? beyond
territorial waters.
The case presents three issues.
First?

do this Court's California and subsequent

opinions require a decision in favor of the plaintiff wholly
without regard to the massive evidence produced at trial?
Second?

assuming? as we deny? that Continental

Shelf rights first came into existence by virtue of the
Truman Proclamation in ‘945? did those rights arise in
favor of the States or c; the federal government?

4

Third, if the Court holds in favor of the States
that federal ownership is not required by California, but
rejects the State3s argument that any Continental Shelf rights
"

arising in 1945 would have arisen in their favor, then -the
question becomess

Whether the States have made out their claim

to the resources on the basis of an historic title?
The first question, then, is whether the California
line of cases compels a decision in favor of the plaintiff»
We think the very fact that this Court referred this
case to a Special Master, in the face of the United States'
argument that the result was preordained by California,
strongly indicated that this Court wished the issues to be
rp

examined on their merits and not decided by an automatic
application of precedent»
Nonetheless, the Master believed himself obligated
to grant the plaintiff's original motion for judgment on the
pleadings by applying what ha believed to be the California
doctrine.
There are a number of important distinctions between
this case and California, and, we submit, California stands for
somewhat less than is usually alleged»
The contention which the Court there declined to
accept was that the original Atlantic States had held, prior
to the Revolution, a uniform three-mile belt of territorial
waters, a contention which is very different from the contention

5

the States made here»
In California, the Court looked into that contention
that there was a three-mile belt prior to the Revolution, and
found, quits correctly, that no one had ever heard of a threemile limit or a three-mile belt prior to the Revolution.
Since that was the only contention that had been
made to the Court, the Court quite naturally held that the
contention had not been established,, and that California had
not provide its case.
Even as to that contention, the Court said only
that on the basis of the materials it. had then bee furnished,
it could not say that pre-Independence, Colonial ownership
of a three-mile belt had been made out»
It's notable also that Massachusetts, one of the
defendant States before you today, sought leave to intervene
in the California case,.

The Court denied intervention.

That denial was presumably on the ground which the plaintiff,
both there and here, had urged to the Court, that, and I
quote, "Massachusetts cannot be affected by any judgment which
may be entered in this suit."
It’s unclear, perhaps, also whether the California
Court believed that the federal interests in the Shelf, which
it described, would prevail even over an established State
historic title, or whether the Court merely believed that
"those federal interests would establish federal ownership in

the absence of a historic title on behalf of anyone.
The Court never reached the former question, whether
the federal interest would defeat an established State title,
because it held that the evidence before it had not established
any State title.
7-md, finally, as I will argue in a few moments, in
detail, developments have occurred since the California
decision, both congressional action and subsequent decisions
of this Court, which decisively undercut the California
rationale.
In these circumstances, it. is wholly understandable,
I think, that when this case was brought, raising for the
first time directly, with the appropriate parties before you,
whether the Atlantic Coastal States own their Continental
Shelf beyond the three-mile limit or not.
The Court would wish to consider the issue as a
nevr matter, and on the basis of a complete record.
That record has now been made.
It's idle, perhaps, to debate whether some or much
or most of the material now of record was before you in
California.
I can assure the Court with confidence that a compari­
son of the record in the two cases will leave no doubt 'that
the present record is immensely superior, not only in the volume,
the scope, the completeness of the material, of the primary

materials,, but in the depth and sophistication with which the
bare bones of those primary materials have been analyzed,.
In the previous cases , only those bare bones
were before you.

In none of those cases was there any

reference to a Master,

There were no trials»

The cases were

decided on the bare pleadings,,
Our record, aside from a great wealth of documentary
evidence, contains analysis by ten expert witnesses and
extensive cross-examination of them.
The plaintiff appears to think less of its expert
witnesses than we do of ours, when it argues that little of
significance is now before the Court that was not before it in
California,
One would think, given the extreme complexity of
the questions of history, legal history, technology,
international law, international legal history, and related
subjects, one would expect the plaintiff to believe, as we
do, that analysis by qualified scholars in the relevant
fields would be of great assistance if not essential to the
Court,
One reason why the plaintiff apparently thinks
otherwise is that its own expert witnesses ended up agreeing
with the defendants' position on many if not most of the
relevant issues of fact and law.
I shall be referring to these concessions with some

8

frequency during the course of this argument, and I would
suggest that in all the record that is before you today, both
the original imprinted record, of which that is but part, and
the printed record, perhaps the most important part is the
last 15 or 20 pages of Volume I of our Appendix, from about
page 520, 528 through to the end, 558, thirty pages.
And I would urge you to read those pages over and
over again, because they contain the most crucial of the
many concessions made by plaintiff’s witnesses in the course
of cross-examination,
Beyond any comparison of records, this would seem
in every respect a case where the Court would deem it appro­
priate to take a fresh look, unfettered even by any presump­
tion arising from its past decisions.

MR, CLAGETT:

528.
— through 55 8? it's the last thirty

pages of Volume I of the Appendix,
QUESTION: Thank you.
Beginning with Idle cross-examination of Mr, Kavenagh?
MR» CLAGETT:

Mr, Kavenagh, yes, sir.

Stare decisis is readily overcome in matters of
transcendent, public, and constitutional importance, which

9
this case surely is*
California itself overruled many previous decisions
of tliis Court, which it affirmed State ownership of land under
navigable waters, whether inland or not.
Let us then consider the issue on its merits.

The

States claim they have an historical title to these
Continental Shelf resources.

The plaintiff, while contesting

our version of the history, primarily argues that it is all
irrelevant.
The Continental Shelf, plaintiff says, belongs to
the federal government as a corollary of its external
sovereignty, thus, plaintiff claims, even if the States
would otherwise have perfect title to the Continental Shelf,
it has been stripped from them by the Constitution’s vesting
of external sovereignty in the federal government.
That phrase "external sovereignty" doesn’t appear
anywhere in the Constitution, it’s the jargon that’s generally
used to indicate the fact that it is the federal government
and not the States individually which is an international
person, a nation recognized by the world community as an
equal member of the family of nations, with rights and
responsibilities under international law.
But it in no way follows from -that external
sovereignty, we submit, that the United States, as distinct
from the individual States, owns or must own these Continental

10

Shelf resources.
International law has nothing to say, one way or the
other, about the ownership of Continental Shelf resources as
between the States and the federal government, or about
similar issues in any other federal system.
As an international matter, it's the United States,
not the States, as distinguished from other nations which owns
these resources..
But it's wholly compatible with international law
and with the plaintiff's status as external sovereign for the
States to own these resources as a matter of our own law.
I won't dwell on this point, because plaintiff's
international law witness, Professor Henkin, conceded it, and
1 don't understand the plaintiff to be seriously contesting it,
though there’s a passage on page 55 of the plaintiff's brief
which suggests that possibly it may still be contesting it.
There's nothing in the nature of external sovereignty
which requires -that in a federal system of government that
entity which possesses external sovereignty be also the same
entity which owns Continental Shelf resources.
The constitutional law of the federal system may
determine that question any way it wishes.

This Court

expressly and clearly so held in the second Louisiana case
in 1960.
There’s no magic in the fact that these resources lie

11
outside our national boundaries, which means that the external
sovereign has to own them*
Plaintiff's argument that tiers is, I have never
been able to understand, except as a superficial play of
words on the word ’'external".

It's "outside", therefore the

federal government, must own it.
There's nothing to it.
One illustration that was used at the trial to
explode this was a hypothetical parcel of land in Virginia -excuse me, a hypothetical parcel of land in England, which
Virginia owned before the Revolution; the Colony of Virginia»
Plaintiff's witness conceded

this concession is

at page 543 of the Appendix ~~ that Virginia would have
retained that land once the federal government became the
external sovereign, whenever that was»
No magic would have caused title to pass.
The situation is no different in any respect with
regard to the Continental Shelf rights at issue here, we
submit.
When plaintiff's argument is analysed, it appears
•that what plaintiff is really claiming is not that plaintiff's
bare status as external sovereign gives it -these resources,
plaintiff’s real argument is that certain powers vested in
the federal government by the Constitution, the foreign
affairs power, the defense power, the power over foreign

12

commerce, cannot properly be conducted without, federal ownership of the Continental Shelf»
Therefore, plaintiff argues, by vesting those powers
in the federal government, the Constitution necessarily
transferred ownership from the States to the federal govern­
ment, assuming of course that the States had owned them before»
Plaintiff is rather cautious about making this argu­
ment, rather indirect about it, for excellent reasons, as I
think we'll see in a moment.
But if that is not plaintiff's argument, if that is
not the guts and the gist of it, then I am wholly at a loss to
understand what the plaintiff's argument is„
When the argument is submitted to scrutiny, it is
seen to be a mirage, wholly devoid of substance.

Plainly,

the federal government’s foreign affairs, defense, and foreign
commerce powers are both broad and paramount? they override
any competing State interests

But -these powers no more

require federal ownership of the Continental Shelf resources
at issue here than they require federal ownership of all the
land or all the minerals in the land territory of the United
States, where the federal government also has, both those and
others, broad and paramount constitutional powers»
Let us take the foreign affairs power first.
The plaintiff has failed to give any illustration
whatever of any way in which that power could possibly be

hindered, or embarrassed, by State ownership of Continental
Shelf resources.
No one questions that the federal government has the
power, by treaty with other nations or otherwise, to define
the outer extent of the Continental Shelf which is under our
exclusive national ownership»
If there were previous State rights out there, the
federal government could cut them off by treaty or otherwise
in the pursuit of the foreign affairs power»
By the Continental Shelf Convention of 1958, in
agreement with other nations, the federal government did
precisely that.

No one doubts that that was a proper

exercise of the foreign affairs power.
QUESTIONS

You say that even though property

rights may have existed outside the three-mile limit, that
the federal government, with its foreign affairs power, can
cut them off?
MR. CLAGETT;

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

unques tionably„
QUESTION; Would it have to pay compensation?
MR. CLAGETT;

If it took them in the course of a

genuine foreign relations settlement with other nations, I
would say no.

If it was done in the exercise of the foreign

affairs power, I would analogize it to a boundary settlement
which would not require compensation.

14
If the United -- if the treaty were nothing but a
camouflage,, if what was really being done was that -the federal
government wanted to cut those State rights off for non­
legitimate foreign affairs purposes , then I would say yes.
Similarly, under 'the doctrine of Missouri vs, Holland,
the federal government may, by treaty, accept international
regulation of Continental Shelf activity for foreign policy
ends.

Such regulation would bind the States and would supersede

any contrary State law*
If any State or State license to exploitation of
Shelf resources interfered with the right of free navigation,
over the suparadjacent waters, which international law
establishes, then tite federal government would have both the
duty under international law and the right under our own law
to stop that interference.
Since 1953, the States have admittedly owned seabed
resources out to three miles, and, indeed, out to ten miles
in the case of some of the Gulf States,
No one claims that State ownership an exploitation
of these resources has presented any international embarrassment
whatsoever, or any foreign policy complication or problem,
Plaintiffs international law witness, Professor
Henkin, conceded that no such problems had arisen* That
concession,by an oversight, we didn't put in our Printed
Appendix.

It's on page 2647 of the transcript»

15
The defense power, likewise, has nothing to do with
ownership of Continental Shelf resources.

The United States

can defend and has defended the land territory of the United
States without owning all the land in the country.

Why is

the Continental Shelf one whit different?
Plaintiff has suggested no reason.

Plaintiff's

bare assertion that there is a difference is particularly
implausible when it is remembered that the States here are
claiming only the resources of the seabed. They make no
claim to the waters above.
If it be said that the defense power may require
the exercise of federal control over these resources, for
example, to insure their more rapid and defective exploitation
in time of national emergency or war, no one can doubt that
the defense power permits precisely that.

Just as it permits

similar control over the resources, natural and human, of
the entire country.
No one has ever proposed that the defense power
requires federal ownership of every tiling in the country.
Unchallenged testimony before the Master described how the
federal government is readily able to marshal and direct all
the resources of the naticn, whenever that becomes necessary.
The same is true of the power over foreign commerce.
If the federal government decides that the energy crisis or
some other economic factor requires that Continental Shelf

16

resources be developed at a different pace or in a different
manner from what the States are doing, the federal government
plainly has the constitutional power to exercise all the
control necessary to achieve that end.
I want to emphasize this point.

It's critical.

Because of fears expressed in some quarters, that the States,
because of environmental concerns or parochial pressures of
one sort of another, might retard or impede Continental Shelf
development to the detriment of the national interest.
As I shall argue in a moment, the States have
important legitimate interests in what happens off their
shores, which can be implemented only through ownership of
these resources.
But if the federal government found, and I repeat,
that the national interest required overriding those State
concerns and developing Shelf resources, faster or differently
than the States are willing to permit, it is beyond question
that, the federal government could validly so act.
QUESTIONS Would the federal government have more
authority over the Shelf resources than it would over land
resources that were the property of the State?
MR. CLAGETT:

That would depend on whether the

particular purpose involved the Shelf resources more than it
.involved land.

I think there's no question that if a State

owned a uranium mine on land, and the State refused to exploit

17
it, and the federal government needed it for the national
defense, or whatever, that of course the federal government
could require development of that mine.
QUESTIONS

With or without compensation?

MR. CLAGETT:

I would say without compensation, if

it were the State that was getting the revenues from it.
In other words

of course it could be taken by the eminent

domain power? but the government, short of taking it, could
say, We will require that it be developed? you will get the
revenues.

You're getting more money than you got before.
Of course, no compensation is due, nothing has been

taken.

It's simply a regulatory measure requiring a different

manner of development from what the

State would have chosen

on its own, in order to accomplish some overriding national
purpose.
QUESTION:

Is that not rather a unique form of

ownership, if that's the right term?
If it's subject to those burdens.
MR. CLAGETTs

I would submit, Mr. Chief Justice,

that it is precisely the same form of ownership that every
acre, every building, every car, every tank, every truck in
the country is subject to.

And again I cite the case of the

hypothetical State=owned uranium mine.
This is no different from anything alse.
\

;

there's nothing whatever that'snunique about it.

I think

IS
The fundamental flaw, then, in our submission, in
the plaintiff’s argument is to assume that there is something
special or unique about the Continental Shelf, which means,
contrary to the situation everywhere else, that the exercise
of constitutional power there requires ownership in property„
Plaintiff has steadfastly declined to tell us what
that difference is, and in fact there is none»
in
As Mr. Justice Reed said, dissenting/the California
case, State ownership, quote, "would not interfere in any way
with the needs or rights of the United States in war or peace.
The power of the United States is plenary over these undersea
lands, precisely as it is over every river, farm, mine, and
factori»' of the United States»"

Unquote.

Justice Frankfurter's dissenting opinion was precisely
to the same effect on that subject.
An argument similar to the plaintiff's argument
here was made in United States vs«. Bevans, decided in 1818»
There the federal government argued that territorial sovereignty
over the waters of Massachusetts Bay had been transferred from
Massachusetts to the United States by virtue of the federal
constitutional admiralty jurisdiction.
The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall,
said that it was incapable of feeling any doubt that this argu­
ment was wholly spurious.

The Court made a sharp distinction

between the paramount federal powers on the one hand and the

19

residual jurisdiction of the waters in the State.
The Chief Justice, said that subject to the federal
power that jurisdiction adheres to the territory as a portion
of sovereignty not yet given away.
7
The holding Bevans was followed in Macready vs.

Virginia and Srnith vs. Maryland, and in 1090 in Manchester vs.
Mass achusetts.
We submit that this line of cases is plainly correct.
The Chief Justice's analysis applies just as much
to the foreign affairs, the defense, and the commerce powers
as it does to the admiralty jurisdiction.
All these federal powers are paramount when properly
invoked over every State law, right, or title.

But every one

of those federal powers co-exist with and is fully compatible
with the existence and boundaries of State territory, with
State propery rights, and with the residual sovereignty of
the State.
That, I submit, is what our federal system is ail
about, and it’s just as applicable to the Continental Shelf
as it is anywhere

else.

The Constitution itself, we think, makes this
abundantly clear.

Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2, provides

that nothing in the Constitution shall be so construed as to
prejudice any claims of the United States or of any particular
State.

20
The history of this clause makes it clear that the
claims referred to were claims to territory and to property.
The cause arose out of the Western Lands controversy
during the Revolution and Confederation Periods, in which the
States which lacked Western Lands vigorously sought to appro­
priate those of the other States without their consent for
the Union as a whole.
That attempt was repeatedly and unambiguously rejected.
While eventually some of the Western Lands were
voluntarily ceded by the States -- some of them? not all -this Court has repeatedly held that the federal title to those
lands was derived solely from those voluntary acts of cession
and was subject to the conditions, the very substantial
conditions in some instances, which the States had articulated
in the instruments of cession.
This was fully and universally understood with
reference to all navigable waters and the land underlying them,
from the beginning of the Union down to the California decisionP
in 1945.

Every Court decision, every commentator, every

scholar took it as unquestionable, that the States retained
whatever territorial and property rights the antecedent
Colonies or the Crown had had before the Revolution, over
waters and submerged lands, just as over dry land; subject
always to the paramount federal powers conferred by the
Cons titution.

21
The majority opinion, of course, in California
itself admitted, if a bit grudgingly, that this had been the
uniform prior understanding with respect to offshore waters
and their subsoil, just as much as with respect to land
territory and internal waters.
That admission was well taken.

If, by deciding in

favor of -the States today, the Court believes it must overrule
California, and that is by no means necessarily clear, it
would then be returning to a much older and a much sounder
doctrine reflected in Pollard's Lessee vs. Hagan, Martin vs^.
Waddell, HanChester vs. Massachusetts, United States vsc Bevan,
Smith vs. Maryland, Macready vs. Virginia, and literally a
host of other cases.
The alleged California doctrine is an aberration,
we very much hope a temporary one.
The events that occurred after the California line
of cases confirmed what I have said thus far.

These events,

indeed, fatally undermine the authority of California, if
that decision held that the federal government owns
Continental Shelf resources as a corollary of external
sovereignty or of the foreign affairs, defense, and commerce
powers.
The legislation of 1953, the Submerged Lands Act
and the Outer Continental Shelf Act, restored to the States
the seabed resources under the three-mile belt, which the

22
California decision had appeared to take from them.
In the case of the States bordering the Gulf of
Mexico, of course, Congress allowed the Coastal States to
recover their resources out to ten miles p if they could prove
«

%

'

i

historic boundaries out that far.
QUESTION; Where do you get ten?

I thought it was

three leagues -MR. CLAGETT;
QUESTION:

Thre« leagues

— or nine nautical miles.

MR. CLAGETT;

•— Mr. Justice, it’s nine nautical

miles, 10.5 statute miles.
QUESTION:

Nine nautical miles.

Well, we're

talking about nautical miles all the way through here, aren't
we?
MR. CLAGETT:
QUESTION:
MR. CLAGETT:

Nine nautical miles.
As versus three nautical miles.
Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. CLAGETT;

So it's never ten miles.

I'm afraid I've used that as a short­

hand, and you’re quite right, sir, that it's inaccurate.
The legislative history makes it abundantly clear
that Congress regarded the California decision as wholly wrong,
and that it believed it was restoring to the States rights
they had alv/ays had until California appropriated them to the
federal government.

23
How is such a restoration possible if federal
external sovereignty or federal constitutional powers ■ required
federal ownership?
The argument that it was not possible, based on
precisely the grounds intimated by the California majority,
was pressed in Congress very strenuously.
rejected that argument.

But Congress

Its rejection perhaps is not of

constitutional significance, but it is, of course, of very
great constitutional significance that this Court ratified
Congress' view.
In the second round of the Gulf States litigation,
Texas and Florida claimed historic boundaries out to three
leagues.

The federal government argued there, just as it

argues here, with equal vehemence, that such boundaries,
such Continental Shelf ownership could not be recognized even
in spite of the statute without doing violence to federal
external sovereignty to the foreign affairs and defense
powers and to the three-mile limit.
This Court rejected that argument and accepted
Congress'

judgment that it was perfectly possible for the

States to own Continental Shelf resources, both within and
beyond the three-mile limit, without doing any violence to
federal powers or prerogatives.
The plaintiff here argues that in the second Gulf
litigation this Court never said it was repudiating the

24
California rationale, and indeed that there was language in
the opinions that seems to reaffirm California,

That is true.

But it is equally true, we submit, that the
California doctrine cannot co-exist with the later doctrine of
the second Gulf litigation»
If the federal government owns sub-sea resources as
a corollary of external sovereignty or a corollary of tine
foreign affairs and defense powers, as California seemed to
suggest,

then how could this Court countenance alienation of

those necessary national rights by Act of Congress?

Such an

alienation would be just as invalid on the California theory
as if Congress had passed a law abdicating the function of
ratifying treaties, for example, to a committee of the State
Governors»
Further proof of the repudiation of California by
subsequent events is found in Alabama vs» Texas, decided in
1954, tire year after the Submerged Lands Act was passed.

This

Court, in a brief per curiam opinion, upheld the constitution­
ality of the Submerged Lands Act by even refusing to allow a
complaint to be filed challenging it.
The most interesting fact about Alabama vs_,

Texas,

I submit, is that Justice Black, the author of the California
opinion, vehemently dissented on the ground that the 1953
legislation did appear to be inconsistent with California's
rationale, that federal ownership was essential for federal

25

external sovereignty and constitutional powers.
The legislation. Justice Black declared, and I quote,
"raised serious and difficult questions with respect to the
authority of Congress to relinquish elements of national
sovereignty over the ocean."
I submit that Justice Black was wholly correct in
perceiving that his California opinion and the Submerged Lands
Act could not both stand.

By upholding the Act, this Court

necessarily rejected the California rationale.
In view of this history, we submit that stare
decisis works more in our favor than in favor of the plaintiff.
The California doctrine simply cannot co-exist with the
rationale and the result of later litigation.

Either California

does not require federal ownership of the resources in question
here, or, if it does, it has been overruled.
I've talked a great deal about federal interests,
which supposedly require federal ownership of the Continental
Shelf.

I hope I have shown that they require nothing of the

sort.
That should be enough to lead the Court to consider
the States' historic claims on their merits.

But, in addi­

tion, the States have constitutional interests in these
resources, interests which, unlike the federal interests,
require ownership.
These State interests are described skillfully in

26

the amicus brief of the Tidelands Committee of the National
Association of Attorneys General.
I would draw the Court’s attention also to a document
called Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Development and
the Coastal Zone, issued last November by a Joint Committee of
Congress, the National Ocean Policy Study,

We have lodged

ten copies of this with the Court, and I see that it's been
distributed.
This document is a more comprehensive indication
than any I could give of the States' real and practical
interests in Continental Shelf resources and of the dilemma
in which the States will find themselves if they are denied
ownership of them.
Moreover, and this is a point not mentioned in our
brief, so I'd like to emphasize it, while a decision in favor
of the plaintiff would give it 100 percent of all the
revenues to be derived from Continental Shelf exploitation,
the opposite is by no means true of a decision in favor of
the States,
If State ownership is recognized, the federal
government will remain free to tax the resources to be
extracted, both by means of income taxes on the lessees and
by any other type of tax plaintiff desires; such as, for
example, the excise tax on domestic and Continental Shelf
production recently/

proposed by the Administration,

27
Section 630 of the Internal Revenue Code extends
expressly the full federal taxing power to Outer Continental
Shelf resources.
Thus, a decision in favor of the States here will
give the States, indeed, the royalties and the bonus payments
from leasing, but the federal government will have its full
taxing power and could, by adjustments of that taxing power,
effectuate virtually any apportionment of

the total revenues

of Shelf exploitation which was found appropriate.
Thus, a decision in favor of the States here, and
only such a decision, will permit a reasonable allocation of
revenues between the States and the federal government,
A decision for the plaintiff, on the other hand,
will necessarily give the plaintiff 100 percent and the States
nothing.
Thtis, only by deciding this case in favor of the
States can this Court safeguard any of the very real State
interests and concerns in the Continental Shelf.

The

federal government already has its constitutional powers and
its paramount control there, including the taxing powers.
If it is given ownership as well, it will have everything
and the States will have nothing.
Only by recognizing State ownership can the
legitimate State interests be protected, and our dual system
of government applied to this important natural resource.

23

I have*. I hope, disposed of the argument that the
Constitution means that the federal government necessarily
owns these resources,

I am now almost ready to turn to the

historic title on which the States primarily base their claim.
However, what I have said so far supports another
and independent basis for the States’ claim to ownership.
Since the Truraan Proclamation of 1945 and the
Continental Shelf Convention of 1958, no one disputes that
as a matter of international law every coastal nation owns its
Continentanl Shelf resources.

That’s what the World Court

has called an inherent appurtenance of its land territory.
Even if these resources were acquired for the first
time in 1945, as plaintiff contends, they were not acquired as
an independent or severable territory, like the Louisiana
Purchase or Alaska or some such acquisition.

They were

acquired quite differently, by what you might call sort of a
legal accretion.

They follow from and are dependent upon

sovereignt over the adjacent coast line.
No one doubts, for example, that if the United States
were to cede a portion of its coast line to another country,
the Continental Shelf adjoining that coast line would pass
automatically to the new sovereign, without any express
reference in the act of cession.
It is a corollary — this is the first time the word
‘'corollary'' has cropped up where, in our submission, it's

29

sound.
The Truman Proclamation did not purport to claim the
Shelf on behalf of the federal government as against the
States.

It carefully and explicitly left that question open»
He think that even if the States had had no

historic title to the resources, and if property rights in
them sprang up ex nihilo for the first time in 1945, as
plaintiff contends, under our constitutional system they arose
in favor of the States, not of the federal government.
These rights, as I have said, appertain inherently
to the sovereign of the adjacent coast line. There is no
dispute about that.

Who is the relevant sovereign in the

case of this country?
He have, of course, a divided sovereignty.

The

federal government has delegated powers, the States have the
residuum.

That residuum includes, normally, the ownership

of public lands, and there_is no dispute whatever in the case
of these original Atlantic States, all public, ungranted
lands belong to the State.,
If the argument. I made earlier is sound, that the
delegated federal powers do not require federal ownership
of Shelf resources, then it follows that the residual
sovereignty of the States would attach to them.
Thus, the dual sovereignty of this country would
simply expand outwards to embrace this allegedly new appurten~

30

ance when it was acquired by legal accretion or a change in the
law on plaintiff's assumptions.
The delegated powers of the federal government would
expand to embrace those resources, just as fully as they
embrace the nation itself.

But the reserve powers, the

residual sovereignty of the States would likewise and equally
expand to embrace them also.
And ownership of ungranted lands or resources is
plainly a part of that residual sovereignty, not a part of the
delegated federal powers which entail paramountcy but not
dominion,
The Master never even considered this argument,
because he believed himself precluded by California from doing
so.
The plaintiff has not responded to it in any way,
except to repeat the California incantation.
lie urge the Court that this case can and should be
decided in favor of the defendant States on this ground, without
any necessity for examining the question of historic title at
all.
QUESTION;

Well, in 1945 or whenever it was that the

United States claimed it first acquired title or an interest

The question is which sovereignty.

They are, in themselves, property rights; but they go with
sovereignty, just as the ownership of ungrantecl land in
Virginia, or any other of the States at the time of the Revolu-

They had belonged to the Crown before that, in the case

of a Crown Colony like Virginia.

Government of Virginia.

Ungranted lands in Maryland, by

contrast, belonged to Lord Baltimore, as proprietor.

MR. CLAGETT:

That's correct, sir.

I turn now to the question of historic title.
The matter is necessarily complex.

It involves the law and

practice of two countries and, to some extent, others over
several centuries, as well as international law, custom, and
*

practice.
While the Master conceded some of the links in the
States' chain of title, he resolved other questions, including
the ultimate questions, against us.

My discussion will

necessarily be very brief, I can only hope to touch on a few
of the principal points in dispute.
We have tried in our printed papers to put the record
before you in as clear and as useful a fashion as possible.
We are confident that an immersion in this record will lead
you to the conclusion that the plaintiff and the Master are
just plain wrong.
In the first instance, the States' historic claims

36

rest on their Colonial charters.

Che typical charter

language grants, and I quote, "all Fishings, Mines, and Minerals,
both within the same Tract of Land upon the Maine, and also
✓

within the said Islands and Seas adjoining."

This language seems to us to be wholly categorical
and unambiguous, as showing that the minerals rights and the
adjoining seas were granted.
QUESTION:
Canadian Charters?

Is that language also used in the

MR. CLAGETT:

Yes, Your Honor.

also used in the Canadian Charters.

Other language was

The language which the

plaintiff concedes in the Canadian Charters did establish or
grant the ownership of the seabed, is the language "all Seas
and Islands within" so many miles or so many leagues.
Nov;, as I shall show in a moment, that language is
in some of our Charters, too.
QUESTION:

Do you know why the distinction among

the Charters?
MR. CLAGETTs

As I say, to some extent there's not a

distinction, because that language is in some of our Charters
as well; but the Charters differ among themselves.

There was

no one set form.
Apparently the Crown formulated what it wanted to
grant anew each time.

Some of the Charters seem to be based

on each other, but there «are many variations that don't seem

37

to have any particular significance or any reason for then.
The language I just read you specifically, for
example, was from the New England Charter of 1620.

The

second Virginia Charter of 1609 says, and I'm paraphrasing
nox-*, but this is the gist of it;
All Fishings, Hines, and Minerals, and oilier
Royalties within the said limits by sea and land.
The language varies. The intent and the gist and the
result, we think, is the same.
The language I just mentioned, the plaintiff and the
Master don't even »ention.

While they talk about the

Charters, they talk only about other Charter language which
is much less to the point.
Some of the Charters expressly mentioned all the
seas and islands within specified distances from shore.
Plaintiff admits that that language created the Territorial
Sea in the case of Canada.
But somehow fails to mention it when it analyzes the
Charters in ouif States' chain of title.
There is much other language in the Charters which
sheds additional light, and which we think provides a clear
answer to the question of how far out exclusive rights were
asserted and granted in the American marginal sea.
The language I read you first, from the New England
Charter, we think beyond a doubt conveys fishings and minerals

38
in the sea adjoining»

It does not equally expressly resolve

the question hot-; far out.
We have set forth in detail in our brief, and I won't
go into here unless there are questions, our reasons for
believing that in the legal context of the time, and given the
procession of the Charters, the progression of them, and
given the contemporaneous interpretation of them, as, for
example, the interpretation during the 1620's by the Council
for New England of its 1620 Charter which specified no outside
limit.

But the Council uniformly interpreted it as being

100 miles, and as conveying the seas and islands, not just the
islands; given all this and much other background that's
recited in our briefs.
And given also the fact that every Charter expressly
states that its provisions are to be construed, in case of any
ambiguity, in the light most favorable to the grantee.

Which

is not an idle provision, I submit.
We think the Charters are clear.
The Charter language must, of course, be read
against —

QUESTION:

Total.

MR. CLAGETT:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Thank you.
MR. CLAGETT:

Let me quickly summarize the States*

assertions about the historical background, which we believe
have been demonstrated beyond any question.
From a period long prior to and including the
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, under English lav; the
Crown possessed both sovereignty and dominion over the waters
surrounding England, which v;ere known as the four English
Seas and their seabed.
That sovereignty and dominion included many rights,
among those rights was the exclusive right to exploit
Continental Shelf resources.
QUESTION;

When you speak of dominion, do you mean

in the sense of property ownership?
MR. CLAGETT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Well, wasn't it also just the de facto

40

control of the British Navy?
MR. CLAGETT:

No, Your Honor, we think not,

There

were many periods during this history when the British Navy
was quite weak.

For example, some of King Charles8 proclama­

tions during the 1630's said;

We need a large Navy so we can

go out and take or retake possession of this part of our
sovereign territory, of which, unfortunately, in part, the
Dutch are now in possession.
Before that time, for some years, the British Navy
had not been very strong at all.

It was strong in Elizabeth's

time, but in the later years of Elizabeth's reign and particu­
larly under James, that it declined very badly.

And yet it

was —
QUESTION;
MR. CLAGETT;

James the First?
Yes, sir.

Yet it was James who perhaps took the English
pretensions to their highest pitch.
QUESTION:

When did he reign?

1603 to 1625, is that

it?
MR. CLAGETT;

Yes, sir,

The English Seas were defined uniformly, regardless
of what the state of the English Navy was, as extending 100
miles from shore or to the mid-point between England and the
opposite coast.
There were special exceptions to that, such as the

41
English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, which were regarded as
belonging entirely to England, even beyond the midway line,
because the King of England claimed to be the King of France»
He had admitted those were French waters, but
French meant English as far as the English Crown was concerned.
After the American Colonies were established,
England sometimes took the view that the English Seas
embraced all the waters between the opposite coasts of England
and North America, on the theory that whoever owned two
opposite coast lines owned all the water in between.
But the more general view was that that was un­
reasonable, and that the Colonies had their own hundred-mile
territorial seas, with international waters lying in the middle
of the ocean.
The doctrine of maritime sovereignty and dominion
was naturally, indeed inevitably, extended to this side of
the Atlantic and incorporated into the Colonial Charters.
The Charters generally created territorial seas of
100 miles in width, in which the Colonies owned, among other
rights, the right involved here.
In a few cases of specific Charters, less than 100
miles was granted.

Sometimes the patentee or the grantee was

less in favor with the Crown than at other times, and the
Crown wanted to withhold some of that territorial sea for
itself.

That mainly happened in New England during the later

42

Charters when the Crown was beginning to see that the Puritans
up there were not entirely friendly to Crown prerogatives.
So, in the case of Maine and New Hampshire, for
example, the Crown said?

All right, we'11 just give you five

leagues, and we’ll keep the rest for ourself.
Throughout the Colonial Period, the Colonies
exercised their rights in the marginal seas to the fullest,
extent practicable or necessary.
At the Revolution, the States individually inherited
the rights of the Colonies, and also inherited whatever rights
the Crown had retained in the marginal seas.
Thus, these States acquired the exclusive right of
exploitation.

That right has not been lost by any subsequent

event or development.

It was not ceded to the United States

by the Constitution; it was not renounced to the world at large
it was not lost through any changes in international law.

It

remains intact.
Although the record with respect to English lav/ and
practice goes back far behind the Seventeenth Century, that
Century is of particular importance for two reasons?
First, that was the Century when the defendant States
were founded as English Colonies, and their Charters were
granted.
Second, the Seventeenth is the Century where all the
parties before you and the Master are closest to agreement

43
about English law and practice.
While there remains some differences between us,
the Master acknowledged that by the middle of that Century,
at any rate, English lav; fully recognized that the Crown owned
the resources of the seabed of the English Seas, and indeed
owned the seabed itself.
The plaintiff had disputed that before the Master,
but plaintiff's witnesses largely conceded it.
In its brief to the Court, the plaintiff does not
appear to dispute the point.

Certainly plaintiff has not

excepted from the Master's conclusion.
Mo one denies that during — throughout the Seven­
teenth Century England was intensely concerned with rights

i

in the seas surrounding England, including the seabed, and
that this concern and the Crown's high view of its own
sovereignty and dominion in the seas were fully incorporated
into lav;, as well as carried out in policy.
If there were any dispute, the record is massive,
conclusive,
This, then, is concededly the political and legal
atmosphere in which the Colonial Charters of these defendant
States were granted.

t

Now, the Master found the Crown ownership of the
seabed became fully recognized in English law only toward the
middle of the Century, with the publication of Selden’s

44
official work, Mare Clausum, in 1635, and Lord Hale's later
treatise.
The Master concluded that the doctrine does the
States no good, since the earlier Colonial Charters antedated
1635.
There are several answers.
First, even if the Master were right, the change in
the law which he thinks occurred about 1635 would have been
applied on this side of the ocean as well as the other, unless
there were some good reason for not so applying it.

No one

has suggested such a reason.
Plaintiff's witness, Professor Morris, admitted that
there was no such reason.

That's at page 538 of the Appendix,

Second, almost every Colony, including those which
had earlier Charters, also had subsequent Charters issued
between 1635 and 1700, a period when the Master admits the
doctrine of Crown ownership of the seabed was fully embodied
in English lav;.
Third, the record proves that the Master was wrong
in his dating.

Maritime sovereignty and dominion, which

included the right here at issue, long preceded 1635 or even
1600.
At pages 64-65 of our brief we very shortly summarize
the Court cases, works of jurisprudence, and State papers,
including things like Acts of the King and Council, which

45

plaintiff’s witness acinitfced had full legal force? which
proved the lav/ of the period 1600 to 16 35,

the Privy Council, in the case of the Royal Fishery of the
Barme, held that the sea is of allegiance of the King and is
also his proper inheritance.
dominion?

There is sovereignty? there is

allegiance? inheritance.,
And, therefore, the King shall have the land which

is gained out of the sea, it’s his before, so when it isn't
sea any more, it still is his,
Robert Callis, writing in 1622, repeatedly declared
it to be the law of England that the seabed was the King's
when it was covered with waters,
Selden's book itself was written by 1610, and v/as
well known to the Crown and the Government from that time
forward.
As to the pre- and pos ^Seventeenth Century periods,
the Master and the plaintiff claim that English law allowed
only for English jurisdiction in the English Seas, not for
seabed ownership.

In fact, there is evidence as far back as

the Thirteenth Century, both that seabed ownership was
recognised and that the English Seas were regarded as fully
a part of the Realm of England,
However, taking plaintiff and the Master on their

own terms, what was the content of the jurisdiction which they

46

mors or less concede?
Plaintiff's witness* Professor Thorne* admitted that
that jurisdiction included the right to grant exclusive
fisheries in the sea; such grants included sedentary* that is
seabed* fisheries.
He also conceded that the jurisdiction included the
right to tax sea fisheries.
Undisputed documents of record show that the juris­
diction included the right both to define by statute and to
punish in the courts crimes at sea* and the right to regulate
the time* manner* and extent of fishing for conservation and
other purposes.
Plaintiff's brief* at page 34*concedes that the
jurisdiction included the power to regulate fisheries.

That

power plainly extended to sedentary fisheries and other seabed
resources as well.

And the power to regulate includes the

power to license and to tax.
If plaintiff says that I've misunderstood them in
thinking they're making these concessions* that I've been too
broad* that they’re not making them, or that they're retracting
them; then the fact is that the concessions* whether they're
still making them or-not* are utterly required by the record*
which is crystal-clear on all these points.

MR. CLAGETT:
QUESTION s

Yes, sir.

Unh-hunh.

MR. CLAGETT:

Plainly then, even if the Crown had

not been recognized as owning title to seabed land, the
jurisdiction which, by concession, existed and which, if not
by concession,certainly exists by the record, embraced the
right to regulate, to license, and to tax the private exploita­
tion of maritime resources, both surface and seabed.
That, of course, is the precise right at issue in
this case? whether it is called jurisdiction, ownership,
sovereignty, or anything else, is of no consequence.
This, then, is the background of English law
necessary to understand what happened when the American
Colonies, the predecessors of these defendant States, were
founded.

And, as I’ve suggested, when you look at the

Colonial Charters, you find precisely what you would expect to
find in the light of that legal background.
The plaintiff and the Master have portrayed the
Seventeenth Century English colonization of North America as
fundamentally indifferent to maritime affairs and maritime
resources.

Nothing could possibly be further from the truth.
From the very beginning of colonization in

48

Elisabeth's reign, England's expansion into the New World
focused largely, if not primarily, on control of the sea and
exploitation of maritime resources:

fish, pearls, and precious

metals, if they could be found.
The very first act of the English colonization in
North America was the expulsion of fishermen of other nations
from the Newfoundland fisheries in 1582.

And when King James

asked the Pilgrims why they wanted to go to New England, they
replied in one ward;

Fishing.

Every schoolchild —
QUESTION;

It wasn't freedom of religion then, it

was fishing?
[Laughter. ]
MR. CLAGETTs

That's what they said when they were

asked, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Apparently freedom of religion

was something else.
Every schoolchild knows how heavily colonization
focused on precious things like gold, silver, and pearls.
Seventeenth Century England, as we have seen, was,
in the highest degree, conscious of the importance of exclusive
rights of sovereignty and ownership in its waters.

And the

very persons, the individuals most active in the chartering and
founding c£ the American Colonies, were the same people
responsible for maintaining English maritime sovereignty at home,
We've given a long list of them, with short bio™

49
graphical descriptions.
Given this background, it is flatly incredible -that.
English law did not extend to the American marginal seas the
same principles of maritime sovereignty and dominion which
were so fully established in English waters.
We have produced conclusive evidence that this is
what did happen and what was recognized to happen.

England

expressly claimed and exercised sovereignty and dominion in
American waters on many occasions.
I pass over briefly the evidence demonstrating that
throughout the Colonial Period the Colonies and the home
government were intensely aware of maritime rights of
sovereignty and ownership.
They exercised control over the American marginal
seas as fully as *was either necessary or appropriate, in
view of the limited opportunities for exploitation, which the
technology of the time afforded.
In the nature of things, that control was primarily
directed to fisheries, and -the evidence is most extensive for
the areas where the fisheries were richest and the threat of
foreign incursion greatest.
That is, the waters of Canada and northern New
England,

In those waters there's no question that exclusive

rights were claimed and foreigners were forcibly excluded.
Plaintiff concedes that as to Canadian waters.

There's no

50

difference as far as Maine goes,,
Similar issues rarely arose south of Boston, where
the fisheries were less rich, and there were no nearby French
bases from which forays could be attempted*
No one steeped in this record, I assert, Your Honors,
can doubt what position England would have taken if the
French or anyone else had tried to come in.

Even if the

plaintiff were correct that to own the sea you must occupy it,
these waters were in fact occupied by England and its
Colonies to the exclusion of others.
In its own brief to the Master, page 143, the
plaintiff conceded that during this era control of the adjacent
land meant control of the fisheries.
The issue, of course, did not arise with specific
reference to offshore mineral exploitation, because no minerals
were discovered during the Colonial Period which were
susceptible of exploitation.

But the force and applicability

of the law of a given period are not limited to the precise
factual situations which arose.
Sometimes it is possible to say, with total confidenoe, on the basis of evidence in hand, that if a particular
situation had arisen, a particular known legal and political
system would have reacted to it in a particular, know-able
way.

That is the situation here.
Suppose that at any time during the Colonial Period.

51

a valuable pearl bed or gold deposit had been discovered on a
shallow but submerged bed, bank, or reef, say ten miles off
the coast of any of these defendant States?
Plaintiff's position requires it to argue that
England and -che adjacent Colony would have asserted no
exclusive right over that pearl bed or gold mine, but would
have regarded the resources free to exoloitation by all the
world.
That position defies both common sense and everything
that we know about the lavj, attitude, and practices of that
period, and of every period before and since.

Nations have

never acted that way, they have uniformly acted the opposite
way.
All four of plaintiff’s witnesses who testified
on the Colonial Period conceded that in the circumstances I've
suggested the resource would have been claimed as an exclusive
possession of the adjacent coastal sovereign.
incursion would have been driven off.

Any foreign

The courts would have

upheld that action as a legal right, if anyone had challenged
it, which is unlikely.
We think these concessions by plaintiff's witnesses,
which the record requires, are in themselves enough to make
out the States' case.
I now come to the period of the formation of the
Union.

I've touched on this in the earlier portion of the

52
argument, to the extent the Constitution and the Western Lands

!

controversy are involved.

I shall only state our contentions

in vary summary form.
First, the historical record and the consistent
decisions of this Court, with the sole exception of the dicta
in the Curtiss-Wright case, are overwhelmingly to the effect
that prior to the Constitution — that is, from the beginning
of the American Revolution through the Confederation Period ~~
the States were individually sovereign, up to and including
being international persons subject to international law.
Chief Justice Marshall, for example, express3„y so
held in Gibbons vs, Ogden in 1024.

And there are many other

cases which are cited in our brief.
Second, be that as it may, each State was deemed to
have succeeded to all the territorial and ownership rights of
its predecessor Colonial Governments, as defined by its
Charters, and to all ownership rights pertaining thereto
which, prior to the Revolution, had been vested in the Crown.
It’s hard to over-emphasize the explicitness of the
documents of record in showing how zealously the Founding
Fathers guarded the territorial and property claims of each
State individually,, and how categorically they rested on the
individual rights of succession by each State separately to
its Colonial Charters and to the Crown prerogatives, as
continuing unimpaired.

This right, then, this exclusive right to exploit
Shelf resources, was one of the maritime rights which these
defendant States had by virtue of English law and their
Charters long before the plaintiff here came into existence»
They have never lost it.

It remains intact.

As to plaintiff’s argument that the right was
abandoned or destroyed by virtue of the three-mile limit,
I will have to rest on our briefs, because there is one final
matter I need to mention.
That is the matter of possible further proceedings
after the Court decides this case.
Whichever way the Court decides, certain questions
will remain:

of delimiting boundaries or base lines with

respect to specific maritime areas.
The Court, of course, heard a case presenting such
an issue just this morning.
The plaintiff apparently takes the view that a
decree by this Court, deciding the issues argued today and
declaring in general terms that either the plaintiff or the
defendants own the Outer Continental Shelf, will terminate
the case.
In its early pleadings, the plaintiff said that it
sought only a decree which would settle the general issue,
quote, "without determining the physical location of the area
on the ground in any particular locality."

questions undecided, the appropriate forum for those questions,
x*e submit, is the district courts.
Under legislation enacted in 1972, the States can
initiate quiet title proceedings against the federal govern­

The United States has been able to do the same against

the States for many years.
The federal government has chosen that route, as you

MR. CLAGETT:

Massachusetts has now chosen the same

route, by seeking a district court adjudication of the base

Others of the defendant States here are considering
bringing similar actions.
For mutual availability of this

route, which was not

the case until two years ago,makes it unnecessary for this
Court to retain jurisdiction, as it did in prior cases, to
work out these questions of detail by itself.
We think the district court proceedings are plainly
a more appropriate forum to resolve, by evidentiary trial, these
complex questions of geography and local history, which perhaps
you've had your fill

of already.

They are probably a more expeditious forum, also.
Massachusetts has filed a reply brief discussing
this matter in detail, and I'm authorized to say that each of
the other1 defendant States concur in the position espoused by
Massachusetts and adopt it as its own.

QUESTIONS

Thank you.

MR. BORK:

As I was saying, I think the case law

here is ~~ the case law and the history is so clear that
there is no doubt about the ownership of the Outer Continental
Shelf, and that it inheres to the United States.
Nov;, defendants have an extended discussion of
evidence, asserted to establish English law in its application
to this country.

I would point out that it's rebutted by our

briefs? it was decided against them by the Special Master's
careful report.

But I think ultimately it can also be, if

the legal principles governing this case are applied, that
dispute about English law and so forth can be perceived as
essentially irrelevant, and not to obscure the legal
principles that control this case.
Although we have no doubt that the Special Master's
findings on English law and their application to this country
are quite right.
As a matter of fact, the Special Master's Report

60

shows, and as the briefs show, the position of the United
States is supported by so many independent lines of argument,
so many independent lines of lav/, that there's some difficulty
in choosing the parts to stress»
And I will here today urge briefly four propositions.
Acceptance of any one of these propositions requires that a
judgment be entered for the United States,
For that reason, it is not necessary to review every
factual finding made by the Special Master, although, as I say,
we believe them all clearly correct,
I will urge first that as the Special Master concluded,
the issue involved here has already been decided repeatedly
in favor of the United States, by this Court in the California
decision, in Louisiana, and the Texas case.
Application of the doctrine of stare decisis results
in judgment for the United States,
Secondly, I will urge that the Special Master was
correct in finding, upon the record made, that these States
never acquired any property rights in the seabed

off the

Atlantic coast, and certainly didn't retain any such rights; a
historical record which establishes that the California
decision was correct in the first place.
Thirdly, it is completely clear, in any event, and
the Special Master so found, that if there was any right in the
Colonies or in the English Crown to the Outer Continental

61
Shelf, which we deny, that claim would have passed to the
United States at Independence or upon ratification of the
Constitution.
And, finally, the Special Master also found, and
we believe correctly, that even if a claim to the Outer
Continental Shelf once existed, and somehow passed to the
States instead of to the national government, the national
government constitutionally renounced the States' claims
when it adopted the three-mile limit; which was its clear
constitutional — within its clear constitutional power,.
The area was then reclaimed as against foreign
nations in 1945 by President Truman's Proclamation and, as
against the States, by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
of 1953.
Any one of these propositions, as Isay, requires
judgment for the United States, and I think it’s demonstrable
that all four are correct.
The argument for stare decisis, of course, turns
upon United States v. California, a suit by the United States
invoking provisional jurisdiction of this Court seeking
ownership in the seabed in the three-mile belt adjacent to
the cost of California.
California put in issue the precise question
involved here, by defending on the claim that the original
Thirteen States had acquired rights in the seabed.

They said

62
tliree miles at least in the seabed; it wasn’t just the threemile belt that they asserted.
And, on the Atlantic shore, and that California

»

acquired a corresponding property interest on the West Coast
because it was admitted to the Union on equal footing.
This Court held California not entitled to the seabed
on the ground that the Original Thirteen Colonies, which
includes all of the defendant States here, Maine, claiming
through Massachusetts, never acquired ownership in the threemile belt.
Justice Black's opinion for the Court held that the
federal government rather than the States had paramount
sovereignty and, as an incident to that, full dominion of the
resources of the soil under the water area, including oil.
So that the precise legal principle involved here
was decided in California.

It shou3d also be said that Justice

Black made the statement in California that history did not
support the claim that there was any right to ownership of
the seabed, established in Colonial Days.
So it is not a case decided as if the Court had no
evidence of ownership and title before it.
of ths© same documents before it.

The Court had many

And made a finding that

State ownership had not been shown.,
Now, nothing, of course, turns upon the fact that
California involved a three-mile belt, while this case concerns

63

the Continental Shelf seaward of the three-mile belt, because,
of course, in United States v. Louisiana, the dispute was over
a 27-raile area out from shore.

»

And this Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas,
said; "If, as we held in California's case, the three-mile belt
is in the domain [sic] of the Nation rather than that of the
separate States, it follows a fortiori that the ocean beyond
that limit also is.

The ocean seaward of the marginal belt

is perhaps even mors directly related to the national defense,
the conduct of foreign affairs, and world commerce than is
the marginal sea."
Certainly it is not less so.
Well, that principle, of course, was applied in
United States v, Texas as well, which was decided the same
day as Louisiana.
I should pause here just a moment to say that I
think it is not correct, as counsel for the defendant States
suggests, that California was somehow an aberration in the
law. There was dictum in prior cases that would have suggested,
perhaps, State ownership of close-in waters.
dictum.

But only

As the California Court pointed out, til os e were

statements that were too broad? the courts in those cases
were dealing usually with inland waters.

So that there was

no law which California suddenly overturned.
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, what do you make of

64
Justice Frankfurter's comment in the Texas case, that in
California the Court did amend the proposed decree submitted
by the government to strike out the terms of proprietorship?
HR. BORKs

I've been puzzled over that, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, because the dcree gives dominion and full control
and so forth, and I think later decrees given proprietorship
in these State cases.

And I'm not quite clear what the

significance of that striking of those words is.

We have never

quite understood what the significance was.
And I think later decrees do give proprietary rights.
Now, these cases are well established, and there are
•two lines of attack that defendants make upon thera„ in an
effort to get them overturned.
The first line of attack is that these cases have
been repudiated by Congress in the Submerged Lands Act of
1953, and abandoned by this Court when it sustained the Submerged
Lands Act.

I think there's nothing whatever in that notion.
The Submerged Lands Act, and decisions under it,

far from repudiating California and the progeny, the other
cases it spawned, adopt it and proceed from it.
The Act, of course, relinquished these very States’
proprietary rights within the three-mile belt of the Atlantic
Ocean, but retained paramount federal powers — defense,
commerce, navigation and so forth.
that.

There’s no mystery about

Congress ceded national property to the Coastal States,

65

something it has a clear constitutional power to do under
Article IV of the Constitution, as this Court said in the
Alabama litigation.
The defendant States attempt to make out a': repudia­
tion of California by attributing to CaJL^ifornia a false
rationale, a rationale it does not, I think, bear.

They

argue that California held, or at least that the Special
Master thought it did, that ownership of the seabed is a
necessary and indispensable and inseparable attribute of
federal constitutional powers.

Hence, their separation by

Congress, agreed to by this Court in Alabama v. Texas,
necessarily repudiates the California rationale.
It is clear, of course, that the Special Master did
not read California that way, although the States did urge
that reading upon him? now they impute it to him ~~ I guess
for the purpose of importing into this Court's California
opinion a meaning that could be said to be repudiated by
the Submerged Lands Act.
But not a word in the California case or in the
Special Master's report states that ownership of land and
governmental authority over it are constitutionally forever
inseparable.
The Court was engaged in attempting to decide
ownership of an area between two contending governments? and
aside from the evidence of governmental power over the area,

66

there was no particular evidence of ownership in the usual
sense by either government.
The fact that one of the governments had crucial
governmental functions in the area and the other had very few
was reason enough to assign ownership to the former.
It would have been quite wrong for this Court to
decide how much proprietary interest is essential to
constitutional function; and it refused to decide that in the
California case.
That is a question for political authorities of the
government who have the constitutional authorities and
questions to decide, and in the Submerged Lands Act the
political authorities decided it.
But the political authority, the Congress in this
case, also decided to accept the rationale of California and
the explicit statement of Louisiana, that California’s rational®,
a fortiori, applied further out to sea, because it enacted the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act within three months of the
Submerged Lands Act, and expressly asserted federal ownership
of resources an the seabed beyond the three-mile limit,
And that claim rests upon the rationale of California,
Louisiana, and Texas.

It certainly does not repudiate it.

And to put the cap on it, this Court of course
stated in the second Louisiana case that the Act, the Submerged
Lands Act, concededly did not impair ‘the validity of California,

67

Louisiana and Texas cases, and that those cases were noticed
r«:rN.Mr»? n»»«li,t -«a»

- '• X'

HHjWHI

to all the Coastal States#
Now, defendants’ second attack on this group of
cases is to say that they were wrongly decided because there
is no logical nexus between sovereignty and ownership#

In

doing that, they adopt the stance of Justice Frankfurter's
dissent in the California case#
** -■*

*1 .''--V

«■«V*

He assumed, indeed he must have found, because he
was willing to dismiss the bill without prejudice, that
California had not shown ownership; but he argued that the
United States had not shown ownership either#

Because, he

said, imperium did not imply dominium#
In that situation, said Justice ■ Frankfurter, the
contested area is to be deemed unclaimed land, and the
determination to claim it on the part of the United States is
a political decision, not for this Court#
And he went on;

I have no doubt that the President

and the Congress between them could make it part of the
national domain and -thereby bring it under Article IV, Section
3, of the Constitution#
And he would have dismissed the bill without
prejudice, to let the political authorities of the nation
decide the ownership of the land off the coast.
In this case, the political judgment that Justice
Frankfurter called for has been, made#

By the Submerged Lands

60
Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Congress has
allocated a three-mile belt along the Atlantic Coast to these
defendant States, and claimed the remainder of the Continental
Shelf for the United States.
So that even under the rationale of Justice Frank­
furter’s dissent in California., the United States would be
entitled to judgment here»
Rut I think the majority opinions in California,
Louisiana, and Texas remain the law and also completely fore­
close the claims of defendants here.
The Special Master concluded that these cases
require, as a matter of law, the entry of judgment for the
United States on its motion.

I renew that motion here.

The major purpose of the doctrine of stare decisis
is to assure finality and certainty and hence the rapid
disposition of future cases involving the same issue.
I would suggest that it is particularly appropriate
that the doctrine be applied here, since -the leasing program
mandated by Congress in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
and an urgent aspect of the President’s efforts to improve
the energy situation must await the outcome of 'this litigation»
I think that is the basis for our motion for
judgment.

I think it’s sound.

The remainder of defendants5

arguments are attempts to undercut the historical foundation
of the California case by trying to prove that they obtained

69

title to the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf in
Colonial Times, and have retained it to this day.
Weil, that effort is heroic»

But the title they

claim faces an endless series of hurdles, and I'm afraid to
say that I don’t think their arguments get over any one of them»
The first difficulty of the States' title, arid I
guess it wouldn't be proper to call it a fatal difficulty
because the first difficulty is that it never existed,
neither the English Crown nor the American Colonies ever owned
the seabed of 'the Outer Continental Shelf.
And the English law of the period lends no support
to any such claim of territorial sovereignty.

That conclusion,

as I say, was reached by the Special Master here, was reached
by this Court in the California case, as our brief shows it
was reached by two Justices of the High Court of Australia in
a case there, two Justices who reached the issue in that
case, and it v^as reached by the Supreme Court of Canada in
a case involving British Columbia's claims to the offshore
land.
That’s a rather awesome array of Judges and
Tribunals, who have decided that defendants' basic premise,
its basic historical premise here, is simply wrong.
Now, the Special Master's finding rests upon
evidentiary detail, which is far too copious to be dealt with
effectively in oral argument.

And we will rely primarily upon

70
his report and irpon our brief in this Court and upon our opening
and reply briefs before the Special Master*
I want to say that if one gets into this historical
recordj, it is indispensable that the briefs before the Special
Master be read, because there are endless historical disputes
in this case.

X think I first decided that the historical

evidence did not lend itself to extended oral presentation,
when I found myself trying to distinguish between the various
meanings one can attribute to Robert Callis's 1622 lectures
on the statute of sewers*
But I do wish to say that we do not agree with
counsel’s characterization of this case, that his case is
utterly crystal-clear.
I think it is utterly crystal-clear that the evidence
is dead against the position he urges hers.
Now, the defendants' brief is filled with assertions,
a fact as settled or as conceded, that are actually disputed
in detail»

And I want to give one example*
This matter of the 100-mile limit that was said

to be the plain English law of territorial sovereignty over
the sea.

That 100-mile territorial claim, I'm afraid is a

figment of historical imagination. We think -there are only
two cases, two instances where it was put forward in that
form.
One was by Professor Gentilly who, during the Stuart

71
era, argued a prise case in an English court.

The Dutch had

captured a Spanish ship, I believe it was, and, representing
the Spaniards, Professor Gentilly urged

the court that the

ships which had been brought into an English port could not
be prizes, because they had been taken within a hundred miles
of the English coast.

And that was an area which the English

owned, and therefore must be respected as neutral.
The court rejected the argument and awarded the
prizes to the captors.
The only ether known evidence is a letter by the
Earl of Salisbury suggesting that an Ambassador might make
such an argument to the Spanish.

That’s all we know about .it.

It’s not shown that anybody ever made such an argumento
The rest of these 100-mile limits occur in a variety
of writers, and there are various limits suggested, 60 miles,
10 mile?, 100 miles? but it’s quite clear, if one examines
them, that it is always a protective jurisdiction which is
asserted to go out to 100 miles, not ownership of property,
not territorial sovereignty.

It is a jurisdiction for purposes

of protection against pirates, regulation of navigation when
it’s important, and that sort of thing.

It is not a

territorial claim.
So that this 100-mile limit has to be looked at
very carefully, in the sense of a territorial claim it is only
advanced seriously once that we know of and rejected by the

72

court in that case.
In fact, it should be said, I think, that the States'
case, in a sense, rests upon

historical case, rests upon

a confusion between maritime jurisdiction, a claim to exercise
admiralty policy, a protective concept of jurisdiction? they
are constantly confusing statements made in that context with
statements of claims to ownership.. And that's why

a large

part of this case is so confusing.
But once that confusion .is eliminated, .it. is seen
that indeed there is very little to the States' historical
case.
To summarize briefly, English law made no claim to
the ownership of even the English Seas and the seabed during
the brief period of —- except during the brief period of the
Stuart pretensions from 1603 to 1688.

And that claims

vanished with the Stuart dynasty.
Certainly there was no such pretense to legal
ownership by 1776,
Moreover, there is not a shred of evidence that even
the Stuarts claimed ownership of any part of the American
Seas, much less the seabed of the American Outer Continental
Shelf,
The Stuarts' claims to ownership in the English Seas
rested quite simply upon naval domination^ that was never
approached in the American Seas., And here again there's a

73
source of confusion in this case.
We hear talk about claims to fisheries or sedentary
fisheries.

Of course there were claims, because it was then

established that one could get property rights in an area of
the sea or in the seabed by effective prescription, an
occupation.

And if you worked an oyster bed for a period of

time and fenced out foreign fishermen, you had established
ownership in that sense, but only to the area which you
occupied, and only to the fishery as to which you had a right
of prescription»
And so disputes about fisheries here show very
little about the claim of broad territorial sovereignty»
The English thus never had ownership of the Outer
Continental Shelf that could be passed on to the Americans,
and, as the Special Master found, the Colonial Charters did
not grant such rights*
Had English title existed as an attribute of
governmental power and had it been passed in some form to the
Colonies, that ownership would have reverted to the Crown
before American Independence, because it is quite clear that
by 1754 all but three Colonies had become Royal Colonies
and were governed directly by the Crown0
And as to the others, most of their governmental
powers had in fact reverted* The Crown repeatedly disposed of
vacant and unappropriated lands in the Colonies without

74
regard to the boundaries set out in the original Charters.
A charter grant of lands was merely a grant of an
opportunity to establish settlements and to appropriate land
as incidence to government.

And if the land was not settled

or appropriated, even though it was within the grant, the
Crown would sometimes take it back or reallocate it.
In most cases and I think in many cases — powers,
in many cases all powers had reverted to the Crown by the eve
of Independence.

And this was especially the case with

respect to maritime matters, which were governed ultimately
from England.
So that even the three Colonies that had not become
Royal Colonies lost any dominion over the seabed which they
might conceivably have gained as an attribute of external
sovereignty.
It's perfectly olear, I think, that there were no
seabed rights in the Colonies on the eve of Independence, and
the Master so found.
But this is by no means the end of the difficulties
with defendants* case.
Should we assume, for the sake of argument — and I
think it is only for the sake of argument — that this Court,
the Special Master and the Australian and Canadian Judges
have all been wrong about English law, and hence defendants
alone correct, I think there Eire two propositions that as a

75
matter of lav; establish the right of the United States to
judgment here, and I pass to these now.
The Special Master found that if there were title
to the seabed in either the Colonies or the English Crown,
such rights passed to the United States at Independence, on
July 4th, 1776, or, at the latest, upon ratification of the
Constitution in 1789„
There never was a time when any of these States
existed

as independent sovereignties with external powers of

government.

The national government was formed and was in.

operation prior to the existence of any State.
The Special Master said;

I find that upon the

establishment of the First. Continental Congress in 1774, the
United States of America emerged.
And I
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, you would apply

that statement to both Rhode? Island and North Carolina?
MR. BORK:

I would, indeed.

I would, indeed, Mr.

Justice Blackmun.
I think, as the Special ~ in his conclusions, as I
recall, the Special Master takas as the two effective dates
when the rights to the seabeds, if any had existed, would have
passed to the federal government, as Independence and ratifica­
tion of the Constitution.
I think it’s fair to say that there is in his report

76
a suggestion that one could equally have chosen two additional
dates.

One would be the formation of the First Continental

Congress, and the second, the governing power that they assumed
immediatelyg the other, I suppose, would have been the Treaty
of Peace in 1783,
But it's important, I think, to realize just what
the history of that period was.

One of our witnesses,

Professor Richard Morris, has written an article, consisting
largely of matters he said in his testimony, and I think out of
perhaps an excessive sense of delicacy we did not cite the
article, in our brief -« being less delicate, I would like
permission to cite it now.
It appears in the Columbia Law Review, Volume 74,
No, 6, it’s October 1974,

In which he considers the historical

evidence about the forming of the Union,
quite plain.

And it’s really

It's also in his testimony.

It’s also quite plain that a national government
was formed with the First Continental Congress,

Representa­

tives were chosen by the people of the Colonies and not by
the Colonial Governments, except, in one instance, the —
QUESTION:

Were all Thirteen States represented at

the First Continental Congress?
MR, BORK:

Twelve of them were represented in the

First, I believe, Mr, Justice Rehnquist,
QUESTION; Which one wasn’t?

A VOICE:
MR. BORIC:

It was Georgia.
I beg your pardon?

I hear Georgia being —
QUESTION:
MR. BORIC:

Would Georgia be
I hear myself being supported in the

Georgia claim.
QUESTION:

Would Georgia be bound then by whatever

the First Continental Congress said?
MR. BORK:

I think Georgia submitted to its — to

the jurisdiction and the power of the First Continental
Congress? and in that sense I think was bound.

Certainly

came into the Second Continental Congress.
But I’m describing a period before Independence,
in which the Continental Congress — for one thing, the
Continental Congress initiated the formation of the States
by resolution? first at. ad hoc and then by general resolution,
calling for State Governments.
The Continental Congress issued the Declaration
of Independence, and in fact the Declaration is, in its own
terras, said to be a declaration by the Representatives of the
United States of America, in General Congress as semi) led.
And during this period of time, the Continental
Congress took jurisdiction over admiralty cases, in the sense
that it would hear appeals from the State Courts to a
Committee of Congress,

It asserted jurisdiction to make

78
treaties with foreign powers, it did, it assumed the powers of
war and peace, it even passed laws about treason,, requiring
allegiance to the United States Government, not to the State
Government-

,

So I think it's quite clear that there was a national
government operating and claiming legal powers and exercising
legal powers before the States had really come into existence.
QUESTION; Well, isn’t it also true, Mr. Solicitor
General, that in the period after 1776 and before the
ratification of the Constitution that at least some of the
States were purporting or trying to carry on their own foreign
policies?
MR. BORIC;

I think there was some ~ I think there

was no successful effort evt that.

I think Russia and some

other countries attempted at one point to deal with the
States individually.
QUESTION; And wasn't that really one of Che very
basic reasons fox’ the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia?
MR. BORK;
QUESTION;

Well, I think —
Wasn't that one of the big problems,

and wasn’t that one of the basic accomplishments of the
Constitution?
MR. BORK;
QUESTION;

I think that —
That the foreign policy of these newly

independent United or partly United — newly independent States,

79

on this eastern shore of the North American Continent# to put
the foreign affairs into one sovereignty rather than keeping
it in thirteen?
MR* BORK:

I think it was quite clear, even so#

before that# Mr. Justice Stewart# that the United States
insisted upon speaking for the States and not letting the
States run their own foreign policy.
I think our diplomatic experience from 1776 on
shows that.
QUESTION:

What was the first mission that tills

Continental Congress authorized to
MR. BORK:

Its mission abroad?

I don't know# and

I was wondering if I had similar help front the Bench here.
I don't know the first mission abroad that they
authorized.
But they did — they did

in 1775 the Continental

Congress addressed messages to the Governments of Europe on
behalf of the United States.
QUESTION:

But there were many such missions

between '76 and !87 or '89# were there not?
MR. BORK:

Well# certainly

certainly# the Peace

Treaty of 1783 with England was negotiated on behalf of the,
entire United States# and claimed fisheries which seem to loom
large in this case on behalf of the entire United States# the
American people? not on behalf of any State.

80

The fisheries off our coast.
QUESTION?

But the States v/ere not only, as I say,

making moves toward carrying on their own foreign policies,
regardless of what the Continental Congress might have also
been doing, and also they were coining money and asserting
other aspects of absolute sovereignty, were they not?
MR. BORKs

I have no doubt, Mr. Justice Stewart,

til at internal
QUESTION; We all learned that in the Sixth Grade?
that’s the reason they sent their people to Philadelphia in
that hot summer and worked out a new Constitution*
MR. BORKs

That is quite true0

I think the coining of money is not an example that
bears upon this case, and the other things the States did,
such as directing that tariffs -QUESTION;

Yes, but it shows absolute sovereignty,

though, or their thought that they were.
MR. BORKs

That's what —

I think they thought that there were

absolutely sovereign internally, in internal mattersu

I

think they did not have the same thought with respect to
diplomatic matters and speaking abroad.
I think the United States, almost without exception,
Congress had sent people abroad who dealt for the United
States.
QUESTION;

To sustain your position, are —

31
MR. BORKs
QUESTION:

I don't really think I can —
— you going to show that the United

States of 1774-5-6-7 exercised all -the powers of sovereignty,
including raising of armies and so on?
MR. BORKs

No, I certainly don’t.

I was merely

pointing out that I think there are other dates, even earlier
than Independence, by which a national government was in
existence and had external powers and precluded the States
from dealing independently. And I don’t think the States,
Mr. Justice Stewart, never made a claim, any of them, to be
recognised as independent nations in .international law.
QUESTION: Well, do you say the Continental Congress
removed the States from dealing independently?

I think

probably you could make a strong historical argument that
the Continental Congress did deal for that State, but it had
no authority of any kind up to the present time over the
individual State, did it?
MR. BORK:

Well, I think it did, in this sense:

for example, there was repeated disputes about whether or not
Congress could take and review admiralty cases decided in
State courts.

This was before the Independence and right

after Independence,
And the States involved said no, and Congress said
yes? and did review’ them and did reverse State decisions.
And Congress made that admiralty jurisdiction stick before

82

Independence — no# right around the time of Independence,
I think it was just before*
I was asked the question before whether the first
commission — and I'm informed the first commission was to
Britain before 1776, and that Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson
was a representative.
But this argument about x^hen we became a nation, I
think is not essential to my argument; I think it is prior to
Independence.
In any case, aside from the historical evidence,
it's quit© clear that this Court, in Penhallow v. Doane,
by the way, a finding of this Court, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc,
that New Hampshire did not possess admiralty jurisdiction
during the Revolutionary War, on the ground that Congress,
representing the States, was sovereign in external affairs,
So that it's, I think, judicial authority as well as
historical argument.

And of course it is well known in the

case of United States v„ Curtiss-Wright Corporation, this
Court held that — determined that external sovereignty had
passed directly from the British Crown to the United Statas
and had never lodged in the individual States,
That dominion follows sovereignty is well settled
in some of tine cases we've discussed, because the State’s right
to the seabed under the inland waters, in fact, were
decisions that said dominion to the States follows the

83
sovereignty of the States»
The report of the Special Master here deals fully
with this topic# and I shall not labor it further*.
But we have these# Penhallow v. Boane and United
States Vi Curtiss-Uright Corporation# and other decisions # so
that I think that# quite aside from historical evidence# the
doctrine of stare decisis her© requires judgment for the
United States as well.
Now# I think# at the latest, the ratification of the
Constitution in 1789 would have conferred this ownership upon
the United States»

I tend to think it occurred# myself# in

1774? but I don’t think anything in this case turns upon
that# and therefore I will not press that point.
Finally# I will assume — for my final point I will
assume that the State ownership of the Continental Shelf
once existed and somehow survived the series of traumatizing
events that we have been discussing»
It is then clear# I think, that the United States#
when it adopted early in its history the three-mile limit#
and certainly when it took the lead among nations in getting
that limit established as international understanding# the
United States# by that, act# renounced sovereignty in the
adjacent seas. and.seabed-outside -the three-mile -limit? -and - • •
it is quite clear# as counsel for the defendant States has
said# the United States in international matters may cede a

84

part of a State*s territory without the State’s concent, alter
its boundary, if it is acting in foreign relations and
international matters»
And the Special Master so concluded that that act
would have cut off any surviving State claim to any part of
the seabed,
Mow, the three-mile limit was maintained and enforced
until 1945, when President Truman, of course, claimed the
Continental Shelf, and in '53 Congress claimed the resources
outside the three-mile limit for the United States as against
the States? and as the California decision held, the assertion
of national dominion over the sea and seabed is binding
upon this Courtc
It follows from this history that any right the
States may have once had were extinguished with the adoption of
the three-mile limit, and federal rights were later created»
And tills series of events, I think, standing alone, is suffi­
cient to require judgment for the United States,
I suppose I should say a word about the equitable
argument made by counsel for defendant States that only a
judgment for his clients will allow sharing in the proceeds,
*

I think that’s not correct conceptually, because I take it a
judgment for the United States would be used for the benefit
of thcs entire United States, which is a form of sharing, a
different allocation in the share perhaps,

ns
But* in addition to that, it is worth saying that
Congress has previously responded to decisions of this Court
by giving these defendant States certain rights.

There are

proposals in Congress for that kind of allocation of revenues,
perhaps — I don't know if the proposals will pass, but they
are being considered

should the United States prevail in

this litigation, to share the revenues with the States.
I have argued four propositions, which I think each,
independently, requires judgment for the United States.
I respectfully urge that if it can be done, the
United States* motion for a judgment be granted, because
there is an urgent need to have this cloud on title settled
so that, in one ownership or another, development of the
the long process of development of the Outer Continental
Shelf for energy needs can begin.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, Mr, Clagett

suggested that the doctrine of the holding in tile California
case began to suffer some erosion, or at least a further
erosion by the .1353 Submerged Lands Act.

Do you have any

comment on that?
MR, BORK:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that, as I tried to touch upon, the — -this
Court certainly didn't think so, because after the Submerged
Lands Act, this Court said that, in the second Louisiana case,
that the California decision remained unimpaired.

86

In addition to that, I take it that the connection
between sovereignty and ownership,in the California, case#
is not inseparable, it’s just inseparable by this Court®
The political authorities having the sovereignty and the
political power# that is Congress and the President, having
th© external sovereignty in their hands, may make a decision,
a political decision, how much ownership is necessary to the
exercise of that sovereignty? and they have made that political
decision®
I don’t t!iink -that impairs the California case in any
way.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Clagett, you have 14 minutes left.
would prefer not to divide

If you

it between three minutes now and

tomorrow, we’ll give you the option of doing it all tomorrow
morning.
Would you prefer that?
MR. CLAGETT:

Thank Your Honor? I’d prefer that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

[Whereupon, at 2:57 o'clock, p.nu, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 10:00 o'clock, a.nu , Tuesday,
February 25, 1975.]
