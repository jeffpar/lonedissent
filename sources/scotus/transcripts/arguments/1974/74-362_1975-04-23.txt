OPAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. DUNCAM, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DUNCAN;

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The issue before the Court today arises under the
Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act and
involves a construction of Section 22 of that Act which deals
with time limitations provisions.
The Act as it now exists in Section 22 provides
basically that upon his own initiatire or upon the application
of any party in interest on the ground of a change in
conditions or a determination of the mistake in fact by the
Deputy Commissioner, the Deputy COnmissioner may at any time
prior to one year after the date of It

pay

.- ansa­

ti.on, whether or not a compensation order has been issued,
review a consponsa tic.-, case.
The facts, briefly, are that Charles Jones was
.injure--:» wn.ile working for Intercounty Construction in July
f it60,

He fried a written claim for compensation benefits

in August of I960.

The insurance carrier voluntarily paid

awar<

r

January of 1965.
At that point, the carrier filed a notice indicating
that til a data would oa controverted, and it then reduced its
benefits by 50 percent.
An inforari conference war, hold before a claims
examiner and the .matter wi'.s adjourned without any resolution
of the claim of Mr. Janes.
In January of 1919, the carrier stopped making
compennation payments at all because the statutory limit of
$17-250 had been reached, except for death cases end permanent
total disability.

More chan two years later.. Mr. Jones8

attorney requested a hearing on his claim for permanent and
total disability and it is the carrier V> position that; by
having 1st. that time run, the claim is now barred. Principal —
QUESTIONi
Ml,. DUNCANj
as of January-

What was the data?
We would cay, Mr. Justice Brennan,

that

19ft9 — I believe the date would be 'the 23rd.

QUESTION;

Qhie would bo a year after the carrier

stopped mahing; paymenfs?
Et DUNCAN;

Yes, your Honor..

Novj, we rely principally on the strachan Shipping case
from the Fifth Circuit where cert was denied by this Court

J'a *'•' '
tJ’*

•1"’c appears phonetically as stracaa

1 believe the correct pronunciation is Strong#

S-T-R-A-C-fH-A^W

In any event*, that case, considering the identical
issue, cams to toe conclusion that, by statutory set-up and
the regulations implamenting it. Congress ha5. evinced an
intention that compensation payments’«ere to be made volun­
tarily by the carrier and once payment had stopped? it was
incumbent upon the Claimant to file a further claim if he
sought, additional benefits.
!Sow, it might seem at first blush that the filing of
additional claims would foe an onerous burden.

However, there

are numerous cases which have- hold that simple things such
as a telephone call to a Deputy Commissioner or a claims
examine* where a claimant cor-plained that the carrier had
stopped benefits and a memorandum was then pita cod ir the file
was sufficient to constitute a claim.
There are enter from the. Benefits keview Board, for
example, which have? oven held that die filing of an attending
physician * s report is sufficiant to constitute tha tiling of

a claim so that, wo do not

due diligence.
We have cited in our petition for certiorari at leas
three other decisions, two of which are unreported, which
reflect basically the long-standing way the hot has been
applied.
We have the 1942 case in the District of Columbia,

the Me?ad.dea decicicn»

We have the 0* Keefe decision decided

by the Fifth Circuit in 196:« and we have just recently had
a decision by

administrative law judge under the amended

Act; all holding that if

more than one year runs after the

day of last compensation payment? whether or not a compensa­
tion order has been issued# the claim is burred,
Mow, the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit disagreed and rejected the holding in
Strachan.

They cams to the conclusion# first of all,

that

Section 22 was ambiguous and then -they said it was necessary
to look at the legislative history behind Section 22 and that
their interpretation suggested that Section, 22 was only
supposed to apply when the Deputy Commissioner had issued an
actual compensation order* rather than a situation where a
claim had been filed# had never been acted or# and the time
had merely run subsequent thereto.
We believe that the legislative Malory is capable o
more than one interpretation and we

r. g-ger t 'that the Court

of Appeals respectfully was in ei/ror.
I believe it. is useful to go to the legislative
history as it existed in 1327.
this is found at page 16 and 17 of the Government's
brief.
After the Act was initially exacted., the U.S.
Employees’ Compensation Commission # which was charged with

overseeing the Act,, complained that there wars difficulties
arising because, by the time the award had ceased# the
Deputy Commissioner no longer had any power to do anything
about it-

The man would get his money and the Deputy

Commissioner couldn’t change it# even if there was some
reason why he should change it and therefore, they suggested
that there should be some amendments.
How, in Appendix reference 2 wa find — and this is
taken from the Court of Appeals' opinion — we find the
proposed recommendations of the U. 3. Employees Coradssion.
Now, you will note that they are Uniting this
situation strictly to a situation where a deputy commissioner
is reviewing a compensation order.

Then are not 15 -aiting it

with any time framework at all so that what they have proposed
in effect# is, the. deputy commissioner without regard to any
a limitation, may review a compensation order and he
issue a new compensation order or he may make a change by
virtue of, a compensation order.
All of these, of course# requiring an action by the
deputy commissioner with respect to a formal adjudicatory
compensation order.
QUESTION:

This is Section 22 on page 33 of the

Appendix, was proposed but naver enacted.
MR. DUNCANs
correct and

Is that correct?

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, that is

1 think it is significant, because we then go to

o
Section 22 &s it was actually unacted t- which would os found at.
page 21 of tha Government1s brief and I think if we compare
what was done with what was proposed, we see that there are
significan.t c'i. fferences *
First of all, they indicate that the deputycommissioner may, at any time prior to one year after the
date of .last payment of comp eno.ation -**- that, was not in the
proposal from the U.S* Compensation Commission*
It also indicates that ha may review a compensation
case as opposed to review a compensation order so we feel it
is very significant that what was enacted was not wnat was
proposed and as a matter of fact, the House and the Senary
reports for the’1934 Amendment indicate that the eventual
enactments of 1934 ware. aa a result ct. meetings and compromises
between the employees ’ -onions and the employer» ’ shipbuilding
organizations p so that wa do not have n situation where the
U.S. Snployeer Co^niseioa makes reco®mciations*
‘.'Chess are irmadiat C.y adopted by Congress and then
we tala off from there•
parties,

We have a mastin’;? between interested

We have a compromise *

We then have an enactment

which it; not at all similar to what was proposed by tne U.S.
Employees Commission.
Now, X also think that it is helpful to look at some
of the testimony and some of the legislative history after
1934 because in 193 2 we had another amendment to Section 22*

Now, the problem that aros3 ax'car tbs
was simply this;

3 34 amendment

There was no provision with regard to a

situation where a deputy commissioner had rejected a claim
for him fco review it again and so amendments were proposed
which were eventually enacted in 1938 which would allow a
deputy commissioner . even after he had rejected a claim —
within one year to review the situation to see if he had made
a mistake of fact or if there had been a change in condition.
Now,, on July 31st, 1935 — and this is House
Subcommittee Number 3 on House Report 8293, lath Congress,
First Session, which is also referenced generally in the
Governmentr s brie f — we have testimony f rom Mr. Lewis DaIdle
who is general counsel for the U.S. Employees Commission.
At page 14 of that House Subcommittee report, we
have the following discussion about these proposed amendments
QUESTION;
MR. DUN CAM;

Is this anywhere in the brief?
It is referred to, you r Honor, but: it

is not reproduced.
QUESTION;
MR. DUNCAN:

Right.
Mr. Dale! - 3 indicates, Section 9 refers

to the Amendment made last year involving Section 22 of the
Longshoremen's Act.

lie is then asked by Mr. Emmanuel Seller,

rlharn does that limitation appear in the original act?'1
"Mr;. Da Idle;

That as in Section 5 of the amendatory

act of Kay 26th, 1534 amending Section 22 of the original act

X i'

“2t was amended last yoar so as to provide for a
reopening by the deputy commissioner within a year after the
last payment of compensation,”
Nw, the Government's position is that the deputy
commissioner has to issue a formal compensation order.
Our position is that, regardless of whether the
compensation order is issued or not, the time.: begins to run
wl thin one year from the date of last compensation payment.
QUESTION:
1934 amendment?

What if this case had come up before the

How would it. have come out?

With Section

22 reading as it did before Congress amended it.
I don * t believe that there would have

MR. DUNGhN:

been any power in the deputy commissioner to do anything
because we did not have
QUESTION;

the time situation involved.

Well., but you would have a claim filed

and no award aver made.

Wouldn't you have the power to make

the award prior to 1934?
MR. DUNCAN;

Oh, yes. I misunderstood.

Mr. Justice Relinquish.

Yes,

I think what would happen is, that

we would have had the same situation except that we would
eventually have had the ceiling of $7,500 which war. the
applicable maximum then, as I understand it, reach, and then
d-have had th
the claim if the man had done something within a year,
QUESTION,

Weir, but r.osrc \s it about the act .before

1934 that prevents the deputy commissioner from acting after
the expiration of a tear from, the payment of the last
compensation if a claim was timely filed?
MR. DUNCAN"

Well, my recollection is that, as long

as money was continuing to be paid, there would he no
occasion for him to act but if the man said, in effect, that
the carrier had arbitrarily cut me back 50 percent, then ha
would have had the power to go ahead and act.
Now, as long as the money is continuing to be paid
to the man, ha can either make a request for a formal hearing
because the amount he is receiving is

inadequate, or he car-

sit back and be satisfied with it.
QUESTION:

Well, car.? t the carrier always protect

itself by having the — having an order entered

having

an award entered if he — if the carrier starts to pay
voluntarily after a claim is filed which, happens, l suppose,
most of the time.
M2l. DUNCAN:

It does, your Honor..

Well, X think

that that sounds good,, theoretically.
QUESTION:
MR. DUNCAN:

But it is additional paperwork, isn't it?
Mot for the carrier.

The carrier, as

long as it gets protected consistent with what tha man's righ
are, tha carrier is not concerned about the additional paper­
work but the deputy commissioner is, I can assure you. of that
QUESTION:

Well, the United States is againsc you.

2,2
aren't they?

MR<, DUMChWs

Well, I. think that they are looking at

the statute from the standpoint of how they interpret it
rather them hoe the deputy caraiis si oner * s perhaps actually
administered it.

You'll notice in this case, for: encamp!®,

the deputy commissioner actually rejected the claim the first
time around.
QUESTION;

Well, I suppose what you are suggesting

is is that rather than ever start, voluntarii;/, you are just
going to wait until there is an order entered.
MR. DU1IC&N:

Well, this is correct.

In other words,

the whole purpose of the act is, the man gets hurt.

If you

have no issue with rv.spect to his wages or arising out :>£ the
course of the employment, then you start making payments and
if you have a situation where, eventually, if you cut the man
back there is perhaps a dispute, let’s say, on & rating for a
leg or if you have a loss of wage-earning capacity dispute
and the man can go all the way back to day one and get full
benefits, what incentive is there for the carrier to comply
with the voluntary provis-ions of the act?
They will always

fc oh a formal order so t!

they will be protected in the event more than one year runs
after the ecanpsnsat.ip:r. order is entered.
This is completely contrary to the way the act is
administered.

The informal conferences, for example — we

i

the statistics in our brief.
QUESTION ■

You would bo protected after & certain

length of time after you made the last payment required by
the order?
MR. DUNCAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, right,
Yes.

MR. DUNCAN:

But that is the only protection.

wise, the claim can be resurrected at any time.

Other­

The Govern*-

ment3 s position is that if the man files his claim within one
year and the carrier keeps on making payments arid eventually
at some point; in time the man becomes dissatisfied with the
rate at which he is paid and the man simply has to say, "I
want a hearing" and he can go back to dry one and run this
thing out for K number of years,.

We think that this is not

consistant with the purpose of the act.
The x-ray the whole scheme of the act works, vary
simply, is this:

If there is an issue which is controverted,

the parties go to what is called an informal conference.
It is called, in the regulations, a preheating
conference.

It typically is called an informal conference.

The claimant is there.

If he is represented, his

attorney is there and the carrier is there.

Usually the

carriers do not have attorneys present although I have been
there in many instances.
The claims examiner will say, Mr. Soandso.; what is

14
year claim?
The -nan will say, "I'm claiming temporary total
disability for X number of days e’
The claims examiner then goes down all the various
issues, "Are you contesting jurisdiction, statute of limita­
tions,, wages? *’ — all these sorts of things.
He then says to the carrier, "that is your position?"
The carrier will then narrow the issue.
Typically vhat happens, as: in the Sfcrachan Shipping
case, 3, recommendation is issued and this is sent out in the
form of a letter to the carrier:

”It is hereby recommended

that you do tills and you do that."
Either party is given the right to accept or reject
that recommendation.

Typically, if theca is really no dis­

pute, the carrier will sign it as'being accepted, which is
provided in the form, and return it to the bureau and this is
the v?ey things are typically handled and I think that the
statistics

show that formal hearings are definitely abnormal

and informal adjudications which are consistent with the
purpose of the act are the way these things are handled,
QUESTION;
arc

And that recommendation, even though

d by the carrier, is not an order,
MR, DUNCAN:
QUESTION:
MR. DUNCAN;

That is correct, Mr, Justice Brennan.
It is not an order.
It is not,

It. is simply a letter-

It

is r-ot -lent cue in conformity with Section 19 where you are
required to sand, out notice by registered mail and all that
sort of thing.

It is simply a letter saying that we have

had informal conference and based on the developments of the
conference, this is what we recommend.

And they have a place

where it says,. "You are expected to accept or reject this
within 14 days.

If you. accept it# please sign it and return

it to the bureau."
And that is the way the whole act works.

But the

Government is now coming in and saying, ho, this isn't the
way it is supposed to work.

In every case, you are to insist

on an order if you want the provisions of Section 12 to apply.
And we think that this is terribly inequitable in
the typical case that is dealt with at the bureau.
I think that we must, if I may just go back one
second, we — we also have to look at how practical it is.
The Government's brief, for example, suggests, well, you can
always, if you want to protect yourself other than order, you
can always get the matter settled.,
Well, at the time of this act — accident — the
only provision for a settlement was approval by the Secretary
of Labor and I can assure you that to my knowledge there has
only been one or two settlements ever approved by the
.votary of Labor so that is a very impractical suggestion<
Now, I think we must get back again to what happens

16
if this oar:- tion of the Labor Department is adopted.
let's assume that a claim it filed within the first
year and the carrier pays without an award and nothing
further is done.

This cluim, under their position.»
at .any time in the future.

can be resurrected

In the S t r a chan Shipp i ng ease,, for

example, there were 12 years that ran between the date of
last compensation payment and when the claim was actually
prosecuted.
Suppose ve have a situation where,,

again, the claim

is filed within a year end. the carrier pays without an award
and we reach a statutory maximum of — in this case, $17,280
and there has been no adjudication by the deputy comm:5-ssioner
and then we have more than a year ran.
Are we tc say that the man's claim, is still open?
It is still not time-barred by the provisions of fchr act?
We foe), that the Government"s position is becoming
very technical and is completely contrary to the way this
act is administered and with the Court's permission, I would
lihe to reserve my additional time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK ‘H. EASTSRBROOK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

M.b:„ EASTKRBTR&jti:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This case turns on the meaning of a single clause in
Section 22 of the act*
period of tdrao.

The clause appears to mark off a

ft reads, "Prior to one year after the date

of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued» ”
Petitioners argue that because this clausa refers
to time, it must be the time within which an injured employes
must file a piece of paper to prevent soma effect cn his
claim for

compensation.

We agree with Petitioners to this point»
application for relief

Any

pursuant to Section 12 must be filed

within the time established by that clause,
The more difficult question is, who is required to
file that piece of. paper?
vvs sul-rait that the only people required to 2iie
within the time limit established by that elnuse ore those
who seek what the section title of Section 22 says it is
about, a modification of an award.»
Petitioner's argument rests on the premise that
because some employees must file within the established time,

-i\e.n an employees must do so»

nothing in the .statute support

that result.
/

The more accurate reading of the section is that thos
“.■he

to modify an award or a compensation order- ox? the

2 ii
grounds of mistake of f&cfc or change in circumstances raafc
file under Section 22 within one year after the date of the
last payment of compansation, whether that compensation was
paid with or without an award.

They are entitled to at least one adjudication by virtue

of that claim and Respondent, in this case,

.And he — the original claim must be filed

within a year after the accident.
MR,. EASTriRBBOOK:

The original claim must be filed

within cither a year after the injury or a year after the
last payment of compensation without an award.

There are

two alternative provisions,
QUESTION:

And that,

I guess,

is common ground betwee;;

you and your adversary.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That's right.

There is nc dis­

agreement' on that and there is no disagreement on the fact
that this claim was, i

fact, fcimaly filed.

Once that claim is timely filed. Section ISA of the
act efi ws to th«a deputy comiaiss
claim.

Section ISA prov idesi th

subjec t only to Section 13, whi

mr power to adjudicate that
subject only to Section 13 —
provides for the timely

of the claim, a deputy casmissiloner has full authority

1:9
to adjudicate any claim that has been filed.
QUESTION;

there i .* 19 h in the brief there?

MR. BAS TE SB ROOK;

Section X9A is in • the Go'/ernraent ’ s

brief in statutory section, at page 3f procedure in respect, of
claims, subject to the provisions of Section 13? claim for
compensation may be filed and the deputy commissioner shall
have full power and authority to hear and determina all
questions in respect to such claim.
The claim was time!y filed in this case
and Section 13A provides that the deputy commissioner shall
have full power.
Petitioner’s assertion is that a new application
must foe filed under Section 22 even though a timely claim
has been filed under Section 13.

The thrust of our argument

is that that single clause in Section 22 has to foe read in
contexti, read alone, or solely within the bound:: of the
section, there is little indication who must file the piece
of paper to which it refers.
QUESTION:

What the clause is talking about is

whether or not compensation order has bo/m in sued?
MR. EASTERSROOKs
QUESTIONz

'That is tho critical clausa.

QUESTION;

Weil# I can see tart in connection with a

payment of compensation but in Section 22 you Lavs a ritls
that says modification of awards*
MR. .EASTSSB LOOKi
QUESTIO'Is

That is correct.

Suggesting that everything you are

talking about there is dealing with the codification of -an
award previously made and then you have this clause that both
of you regard as critical in the middle of the thing that says
whether or not a compensation r-rdar Las been issued,

comps-.usa felon order tie cane tiling a t an awar d?
MR. SASTS.RBRCOK:

Oh.

The title originally was

inserted in 1921 when the provisions applied only to awards
• nd an award meant, in 1927, an order compelling an employer
2

to pay compensation.
In 1931, an amendment was made in this section pro­
viding that

compensation order that denied compensation

QUESTION::

But in this case you didn't have either*

fOu didn’t have an award either granting or denying compensa
tion.
MR. EASTERSROOK;
QUESTION;

That is right.

By the deputy commissioner.

You had

voluntary paymenta.
MR. BASTERBROOKs
QUESTION;

That is correct.

And as I understand my brother Kahnquiat’

question, it is, how can you have a modification of an award
when there hasn’t been any award?
MR. EASTERSROOK:

The answer is, you can't, which is

why Section 22 does not apply to this case.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought, on the contrary, that

you were relying very, vary heavily on the subtitle ox
Section 22, modification of awards, to explain the meaning
of the language and yet the title simply is inapplicable for
the reasons suggested,

by my brother Rehnquist's question.»

MR. BASTERBROOXs

The title is inapplicable in all

casos in which there has been no award of compensation or
arty formal order denying compensation and that, is precisely
the point upon which we rely, Mr. Justice Stewart, that the
title of the section is inapplicable and, indeed, the entire
section is inapplicable in this case.
Nothing has occurred under Section 22 that would

trigger its applicability.
Because nothing has occurred under that section,
there is ao need to make an application for review, whether
or net within a year after the last patient of compensation*

HR. EASTKiSBOOE:

In many cassos, Justice Relinquish,

employers would, pay compensation without the necessity of an
award.

They are required to do ao under the Act within 14

days of the injury.
The administrative process often took a good deal
longer than that to enter a formal order, even when a formal
order was requested.
In many cases disability is relatively short-term.
Disability may last, ba total but short time, say, two months
of time lost from tha job.
During those two months the employer is required to
pay compensation benefits.

It nay be that the deputy

ae&Mxr htj.onoi? would not have tine to enter a formal order
until six months labor so that compensation had terminated
prior to the entry of a formal award.

QUESTION:

Mr. Eastarbrook, as I read your brief, you

have ignored Strachan Shipping.

Now, are you going to igno:

it in your argument, too?
MR. E/iSTERBROOK;

In our view, we have devoted our

entire brief to explaining why Strachan Shipping war incorrect.
It simply misread the .19 34 revision and the 1927 history of
this act and Strachan Shipping also operated under a mis­
apprehension of the available relief to an employer or his
insurers„
Strachan Shipping assumed that if, after one year,

the claim did not come to rest, there was no way it could be
put to rest.

That ir- simply incorrect under the statute.

The Fifth Circuit itself had earlier held, in the
■ f41°'b.1:

—> that under Section 19C of the act, the employer;

can o^manc. cr. aajudication and receive a compensation order

at any time»

Many claims expire because the disability has

completely ended so it is not tree, as with the operative

forever unless they are automatically terminated after one
year.

It is very similar to the case in which you have filed a civil

MR. E2U3TKRBROOKs

QUESTIONs

well, the way your brother sayo we ought

to read it,
MR, RftST'fcRBROQKi

There are several things that might

happen to claimants in situations of this sort.

Probebly the

most important of them is that if Section 22 is applicable to
every cane in which compensation has been paid without an

award, then a large number of claimants will have their
benefits terminated completely against their will, even if
they file an application on the very day those benefits are
terminated.

They can never resurrect them.

There is a very

interesting reason why.
Section 22 gives two reasons to file an application
under that section.

The first reason is a mistake of fact by

the deputy commissioner,
The second reason is a change in conditions.
If there has been no compensation order, there can
have been no mistake of fact by the deputy commissioner.

«ant'a point of view# taking a look at Section 22 us it appears
on page 3 of your brief, the language in ehout the 8th line
from the bottom of the pegs —~ “.issue c new compensation
order,15

From the Government's point of view# isn't it perhaps

a batter argument to say that that is the critical language
rather than concentrating on this whether or not a compensation
order has been issued and say that Jones# here# didst'*t ask for

the issue of a new compensation order and that is all that
Section 22 applies to?

We think that is highly important

that 'the — all it gives the deputy corisaissibnar power to do
is enter a new compensation order and if there has
old compensation order, we don*t

been no

understand that new compen­

sation orders could have any meaning.
And ns I also suggested to Justice Stewart, the
language in the act providing for the reasons for review
under Section 23 has the same import? a mistake of fact by
the deputy commissioner can't have occurred unless there was
a previous compensation order.
And we think that the better reading of Section 22
is that a change of circumstances

refers to k change of

circumstances since a compensation order was issued.
QUESTION:

In any event# something is going to have

to fee. read generously, however the case is decided.
MR, 3ASTESBROOKS

That*a right.

I think so.

But

our position# to summarise it once more# is that that language
"one year after the date of last compensation# whether or
not an order has bean issuscl,,5 simply fixes the time from
which the

year begins to run and it does not establish for

whom the year runs so that in many casee where an order is
entered after the last payment of compensation# the year
begins to run, before the order is entered and it may be that
the year sometimes expires' before the order is entered.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

::.'c is not in the nature of an amendment.

Claims are construed

rather liberally under this act, and the duty to pa;/ compen­
sation does not depend technically upon what is pleaded in
the claim, but on the actual extent of disability.
Tue function of the claim is to notify the employer
that compensation will be demanded formally if it is not
forcbcoming otherwise and to otherwise avail himself of his
right to an adjudication and it is exactly that right to an
adjudication that has dissipated in this case*.
