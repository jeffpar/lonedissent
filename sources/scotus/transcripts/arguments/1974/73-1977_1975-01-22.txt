PRO CEE D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1977, Alyeska Pipeline against The Wilderness
Society.
Mr, Jordan, you nay proceed whenever you*re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. JORDAN, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JORDAN?

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the District of
Columbia Circuit, to review a four-to-three en banc decision
of that Circuit, awarding attorneys' fees to the respondent
environmental organizations here.
It arises out of the Alaska Pipeline litigation.
In order to understand the facts of the attorneys'
fees case, it's necessary to refer briefly to the underlying
litigation.
In mid-1969 permits were sought from the Department
of Interior to construct the Alaska Pipeline.

These applica­

tions were subsequently amended in December of 1969.

As

amended in December of 1969, they reflected the anticipated
need at that time of approximately a hundred feet in width.,
in order to build this pipeline, because of the heavy
construction equipment which is required.
The statute involved, in part of the -Mineral Leasing

4
Act of 1920, provides for a right-of-way of essentially
fifty feet plus the width of the pipeline? in 'this case 54
feet of four-foot pipeline.
Alyeska, in its December application, sought to
acquire additional space under Department of Interior
regulations that had been on the books for some years —
QUESTION:

Is that the way you pronounce it —

"al-i-eska"?
MR. JORDAN:
QUESTION:
MR. JORDAN:

"Al-i-eska".
Not !tal-yes-ka" .
"Al-i-eska" is the correct pronuncia­

tion, yes, sir.
QUESTION:
MR. JORDAN:

Thank you.
To acquire this additional space, as

a special land-use permit there was a provision in the part
of Interior regulations for awarding such permits.
Nov/, during 1969, and in the chronology set forth
in the Appendix here which reveals that, the Department of
Interior launched what was at that time really an unprecedented
effort to evaluate this pipeline proposal, technically,
environmentally, and what-have-you.
In January -- on January 1, 1970, the National
Environmental Policy Act became law, and that's commonly
referred to these days as NEPA.
In March the respondents filed suit in the District

5
Court.

They filed suit only agjiinst the Secretary of Interior,

and Alyeska, our client, the petitioner here, and the State of
Alaska did not become parties to the litigation until
approximately 18 months thereafter, when they intervened.
The claim in — there were two distinct claims in the
complaint»
First of all, was that the applicants were limited
to 5 4 feet in width, and the Secretary of Interior had no
authority to give them more under the Special Land-Use Permit,
regulations, otherwise.
Secondly, that the Department of Interior had not
yet complied with 1JEPA, which requires federal officials to
consider environmental values, and filed so-called environmental
impact statements for major projects.
Preliminary injunction issued in April 1970.
After that time the Department of Interior continuet
to assess the technical environmental aspects of the pipeline
and also began preparing an environmental impact statement
required by NF.PA.
This statement was issued for public comment in
March of 1972, and in May of 1972, Secretary Morton indicated
his decision to award the permits, including the Special LandUse Permits, which were challenged by respondents.
The legal issues involved were then litigated in the
District Court in August of 1972, and the respondents were

6

unsuccessful on all issues.
The District Judge, who had entered the preliminary
injunction, lifted that injunction.
An appeal then ensued to the District of Columbia
Circuit, and there the respondents prevailed on the Mineral
Leasing Act claim, or that part of their claim that related
to the Special Land-Use Permits,
The Court did not decide the NEPA issues which had
also been litigated in the District Court.

Three of the

judges, however, expressed a view that those issues ought to
be decided, and that the Secretary's efforts complied with
NEPA.
Certiorari was sought to this Court and was denied.
Thereafter, respondents filed a bill for cost and
attorneys' fees with the Court of Appeals.

Sought attorneys'

fees only against Alyeska, one of the three defendants, and
sought such fees only for a period beginning approximately
at the time of the release of the final environmental impact
statement in March of '72; did not seek any fees for the
period in which the preliminary injunction was sought or
obtained.
QUESTION:

Did it seek just for their services in

the Court of Appeals or for throughout the litigation?
MR. JORDAN:

Well, it wasn't for throughout the

litigation, but it covered such things, for example, as

7
obtaining expert coment on the environmental impact statement.
They submitted four volumes of comments to the Secretary of
Interior as part of the public comments.
Preparation of the Mineral Leasing Act brief,
preparation of the briefs in connection with the NEPA issues.
Now, they did not specifically make a claim for the
presentation in the District Court.
were used in the Court of Appeals.

However, the same briefs
A somewhat unusual pro­

cedure, but the exact briefs were used in the Court of Appeals
that were used in the District Court.

So all the work that

had been involved in doing the briefs was initially done for
the District Court, then used thereafter in the Court of
Appeals.
Meanwhile, Congress had begun to consider legisla­
tion to Solve the problems created by the Court of Appeals
decision.

That legislation resulted in Public Lav; 93-153,

which amended the Mineral Leasing Act and generally with
respect to rights-of-way.

But it did more than that, it

contained specific provisions regarding the Alaska pipeline,
and it directed issuance of all the necessary permits for the
line.
Specially said that there would be no further
compliance required with NEPA.

And this, in effect, was a

rejection of what had been respondents' principal contention
in all of late 1971 and 1972? namely, the Secretary of Interior

0

had to consider a common corridor of pipelines through
Canada, rather than through Alaska,
It also precluded judicial review, except for
constitutional claims, and even for those provided direct
appeal from a one-judge District Court to this Court,
After this legislation was enacted, the Court of
Appeals granted the request for at-Jard of attorneys' fees
against Alyeska.
The award was based on what we view as a considerably
expanded concept of the private Attorney General doctrine,
which some lower courts had embraced, and although the
majority conceded that Alyeska had not violated any duty,
that no duties were imposed on Alyeska by the two statutes
which were in question, it nonetheless awarded fees against
Alyeska,
This decision is in direct conflict with the Sierra
Club vs. Lynn out of the Fifth Circuit, which is printed as
an Appendix to our brief here.
Certiorari was then granted by this Court,
Now, our principal arguments in seeking reversal
of the Court of Appeals decision are these:
First, it is our position, as the Fifth. Circuit
held in Sierra Club vs. Lynn, that it is equitable to award
fees against a party who violated no duty and who could not
control the acts of those upon whom the duties were imposed

9
by law.
Second, the court’s unwilling to rule on that basis.
We contend that the Court of Appeals applied an improper
concept of the private attorney general doctrine, if indeed
there is to be a private attorney general doctrine.
Specifically, it was wrong to award fees on the Mineral Leasing
Act aspects of the case, because that width provision in the
Mineral Leasing Act was not something which reflected
peculiar or unique congressional concern.
And secondly, it was wrong to award fees with
respect to the NEPA issues on which respondents did not
prevail in the District Court, in the Court of Appeals, or
in the Congress.
Now, it’s our contention that what the Court of
Appeals did here is a major extension of the private attorney
general doctrine, that it will stimulate a greatly increased
amount of litigation in the federal courts, involving both
environmental laws and hundreds of other federal statutory
provisions,- that there will be collateral litigation concerning
the scope of this expanded and somewhat indefinite private
attorney general exception? and that so unconstrained an
exception raises serious questions of legitimate concern to
this Court about the proper role of the judiciary as distin­
guished from the Congress in seeing which federal statutes are
so important that attorneys’ fees ought to be awarded to

10
support their policies,
QUESTION;

Is there any case in this Court that

has held that there is a general private attorney general
exception?
MR. JORDAN:

There is no such case.

There was a

reference to the private attorney general doctrine in Newman
vs. Piggie Park Enterprises, but that was a statutory case —
QUESTION:
MR. JORDANs
Act.

That's right.
— under Title II of the Civil Rights

And it xvas more in — the Court was effectively

creating a presumption in favor of attorneys'

fees under the

statute there.
The Court noted last term, in the Rich vs. United
States case, that it hadn't passed on that private attorney
general concept.

The Court has noted in .various footnotes

that other courts have discussed such a concept.
QUESTION;
MR. JORDAN:

Yes.
Before I get to the sort of the

principal arguments, let me put to rest a couple of matters
which are raised by Respondents’ brief.
First, respondents seem here to be trying to
suggest that Aiyeska was guilty in concert with the Secretary
of Interior of deliberately lawless conduct in seeking
Special Land-Use Permits as an adjunct to a right-of-way
under the Mineral Leasing Act.

11
This simply cannot be supported.

Even the majority

of the Court of Appeals conceded that the Mineral Leasing Act
argument of Alyeska and the Secretary was, and I quote,
"manifestly reasonable and assumed in good faith, particularly
in viev; of the long administrative practice supporting it."
Secondly, respondents argue that their activities
support an award of attorneys' fees under a kind of common
benefit theory, which this Court has approved in cases such as
Mills ys. Electric Auto-Lite and Hall vs. jzole.
But the Court of Appeals examined that theory, too,
and said, in effect, if you're going to apply the "common
benefit" exception to this case, you'd had to take that
exception and, I quote, "stretch it totally outside its basic
rationale".
The Court also noted that imposing attorneys' fees
on Alyeska will not operate to spreadh the cost of litigation
proportionately among the beneficiaries, the key requirement
of the "common benefit" theory.
£Jow, in this regard, the D. C. Circuit is in agreement
with the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit? in Sierra Club vs.
Lynn.
Let me turn now to really our principal argument,
and that is the fact that Alyeska has been held to answer on
attorneys' fees for asserted violations of the duty by the
Secretary of Interior

12
This argument is really quite simple.
First

,

respondents made two arguments in the litiga-

tion earlier, that the Secretary lacked authority to give
permits to Alyeska in connection with the right-of-way?
And, secondly, that the Secretary did not adequately
comply with his responsibilities under NEPA, which requires
environmental statements and public comment, and circulation
among federal agencies.
The suit was brought only against the Secretary,
no claim was ever made that Alyeska violated any duty.
The Court of Appeals explicitly recognised that the duties
were those of the Secretary.
Now, despite this, the Court of Appeals went on and
awarded attorneys' fees against Alyeska, because of its
substantial participation in the litigation — which I cannot
deny — and because of the massive nature of its interests<,
In our view, the participation in the litigation,
and the massivity of Alyeska's interest, is simply not the
point here.
The point is, as the Fifth Circuit has recognised,
Alyeska was innocent of any xvrongdoing, and yet it has been
held responsible with regard to attorneys'

fees.

Let me turn now, if I can, to the private attorney
general doctrine.
That's the doctrine on which the Court of Appeals

13
rested its decision in this case, and plainly did so.
Now, we contend that if there is to be a private
attorney general doctrine, which, as Mr. Justice Stewart's
colloquy pointed out, this Court has never really approved,
it ought to be confined in sortie way which makes it manageable.
One way to do that would be to confine it to cases
involving either constitutional rights or rights which are
created by statutes which implement and intend to give rights,
substantive rights under constitutional provisions.
And it ought further to be limited to plaintiffs
who prevail in a practical, if not a technical, sense.
Let's look at what the courts have in fact done with
the private attorney general exception.
The brief of the respondents here, Footnote 91,
sets forth a host of private attorney general cases.

There

are 28 there where fees were actually awarded.
When you look at those, you find that 26 of them
involved either constitutional claims or claims under
implementing statutes to constitutional provisions, such as
42 USC Sections 1981, 1982, 1983.
Only one case involves an environmental claim, that's
the La Ra z a Uni da case in California, a District Court case,*
and there’s another case in California involving an antitrust
claim under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.
Not/, 24 of the plaintiffs in these 2 8 cases had

14
achieved success on the merits, and four of the plaintiffs
had achieved substantially the same thing in the form of a
consent decree.
In no case does it appear, at least as we can fathom
it from the opinions, that the fees were awarded against a
party without responsibility for a duty? in other words, a
party which has not had some violation of a duty.
Now, with respect to the sort of the important
statute argument, the Mineral Leasing Act width provision,
the 1920 Act, simply cannot qualify as an important statute.
The Committee Reports,in connection with the passage
of what was then Section 28 of the 1920 Act,
mention the width limitation.

don’t even

Nor do Committee Reports of

similar statutes that have been kicking around in the
Congress from 1914 through 1920.
QUESTION:

How can the Court possibly decide

whether or not that was or was not an imposing statute?
MR. JORDAN:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my

position, or our position here is that the Court ought not
to be doing that, that it's unmanageable, that if you're
going to say this one is important, then essentially everything
is important.
Or if you're not going to say that, but you're going
to apply it to this one, you've got to pick and choose and say,
Well, we think this one is important, or we think Congress

15
thought that this one was important.
QUESTION:

Certainly if a width statute were passed

today, with the environmental concerns that are apparent,
I suppose one might say that it would possibly be very important
that the Secretary grant just so much right-of-way and no more.
MR. JORDAN: Well, I think that could be, but I think
you have to look at how Congress viewed it, not how the courts
view it. And you ought to look for some objective determination
of what Congress thought about it at the time it passed it.
QUESTION:

But you sat here during the argument of

this last case, we have a hell of a time figuring out what
Congress meant substantively in a statute, that we should go
further and decide whether or not Congress thought it was
important.
MR. JORDAN:

Well, I agree with your analysis, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, and I would say this, you know, that you
can kind of go one way or the other.
One way is to say all federal statutes justify
attorneys' fees awards.

That is essentially an abandonment

of the normal American rule of non-award.
Or you can say none do.
Now, a lot of lower courts, and particularly the
Fifth Circuit, and District Courts in the Fifth Circuit, have
said it's justified in certain types of cases.

And they take

the Civil Rights Act of '64 and '68 and the Voting Rights Act

16

and so forth, and they find other provisions, most of them
enacted during the reconstruction era after the Civil War,,
ant. say:

These are closely related, they're in the same

ballpark, and we’ll apply it to suits under these statutes.
QUESTION;

Of course, the Civil Rights Act of '64

authorizes counsel to.
MR, JORDAN;

Some titles do, such as Title II,

but I recognize that the courts have applied it elsewhere.
What we’re saying is that it's not up to use to say
whether there ought to be a private attorney general exception.
QUESTION;

Isn't there a third one,

the general

equitable powers of an Equity Court?
MR. JORDAN;

Well, the opinions of this Court have

often — on attorneys’ fees have often made reference to that
general equitable power.

I would say this about that;

That if you turn the lower federal courts loose and
say federal statutes as important as the Mineral Leasing Act,
you can award attorneys’ fees in your general equitable powers,
you have essentially abolished the American doctrine respecting
non-award of attorneys' fees? giving due recognition to the
importance of federal statutes in the federal courts.
QUESTION;

I suppose, Mr. Jordan, that if we had a

broad equity approach, we might then say that if someone in
the posture of The Wilderness Society brought litigation of
this kind and lost, that attorneys' fees could be taxed against

17
them.

The equity power can’t be one that works just one way,

could it?
MR. JORDAN:

Well, we don’t think it should work

one way, but that's exactly what the Court of Appeals said in
its opinion.

Judge Wright said:

It's okay to award

attorneys' fees against Alyeska, because they have such
massive interests that they couldn't possibly be deterred
from bringing the litigation.
On the other hand, it wouldn't work the other way
around.

So there's a lack of mutuality there, which the -•»

which Judge Wright was seeking»
QUESTION: Well, the same could be said of Ford
Foundation, for example, if it brought some lav/suits, their
resources are probably in excess of that of most private
corporations in the country? but —
MR. JORDAN:

I would certainly think that they —

QUESTIONs

that rationale wouldn't apply to Ford

Foundation, would it?
MR. JORDAN;
Ford Foundation,

Mo, it certainly would not apply to the

But *—

QUESTION:

Do you draw a difference between non-­

profit corporations and the Ford Foundation and people like
that?
MR. JORDAN:

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION; Do you draw a difference between a non»

18

profit corporation and Alyeska, or whatever it is?
MR. JORDAN:
QUESTION:

Well, let’s put it this way —
Well, I mean there is a difference,

you couldn’t collect from them, and they could collect from —
[Laughter. ]
MR. JORDAN:

Well, they may be judgment-proof,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:
MR. JORDAN:

So there is a difference.
That may be a possibility.

But there's no indication that the organizations involved
here are in that category.
We do think that there is a difficulty with this,
the lack of mutuality, and we basically think that this Court
and the lower federal courts ought not to get in the business
of trying to pick and choose between statutes.
If you want to have a private attorney general
doctrine, it recognizes in Civil Rights and Civil Rights
derived cases that possibly is a manageable distinction.
If you start extending it beyond constitutional rights, it's
hard to see where you draw the line.
Let me say, a minute, something here about the NEPA
claims.
As to those, it’s simply clear that respondents
have not prevailed.

There's been no ruling on HEPA.

District Court Judge found for the Petitioner.

The

Three judges

19

in the Court of Appeals, who expressed an opinion, said HEPA
was satisfied by the Secretary; and Congress has rejected the
WEPA claims.
Hence, there just cannot be a valid private attorney
general claim based on the NEPA aspects of the litigation.
I would point out there that even Congress, in
passing things such as Title II of the Civil Eights Act, with
its attorneys’ fees provision* has mads distinctions about
prevailing and not prevailing.

The Title II provision

requires that the party prevail.
There’s some other federal statutes that do not
make that distinction.
But even on something as important as the Civil
Rights Act, Congress at least has required that the party
prevail.
Now, there are a couple of additional things about
the benefits rationale that fit in with the business of
success,
Let me add a couple of thoughts on those.
First of all, most of the specific benefits claimed
here are a result of the preliminary injunction.

Alyeska

wasn't a party then, didn’t become a party for about another
sixteen months.

And yet, perhaps, 70 percent of what's

claimed here really relates to the attack on the final
environmental impact statement.

20
There is, -therefore, no relationship between the
fees claimed and the benefits claimed.
And secondly, respondents claim that it's their
litigation and their activities which have produced these
various changes in the construction plans for the pipeline.
This is of great benefit to the country and to Alyeska.
This just isn’t supported by the record, and let
me take just one example, which I picked from the brief of
respondents, to illustrate this.
They talk about buried and elevated pipeline.
That’s important because in permafrost soil if you bury a hot
pipeline in the wrong place, the soil will thaw and it will
slump, and it may damage the pipeline and could damage the
environment.
Everyone agrees that this is true, and you have to
be careful about it.
But there’s no element of the whole-pipeline business
that the Department of Interior was more aware of and more
concerned about.

That concern goes back to the latter half

of 1969, it antedates NEPA, it antedates this suit by several
months.
In December of 1969, Secretary Hickel wrote to
Chairman Jackson of the Senate Interior Committee, pointing
out that an Interior study had showed there were great problems
with this and that there were a great many unresolved problems.

21
The day before this suit was brought, March 25th,
1970, the Director of the Geological Survey, who was later
to become Under Secretary of Interior, had a long involvement
with this whole pipeline problem, sent a memorandum to
Secretary Hickel, saying:

I've gotten a study in from my

staff people, this is very troublesome, there are a lot of
problems here.

A lot more of the line is going to have to be

buried? there*s no way around it.
And yet respondents are trying to claim credit for
this and various other things

which were the product of the

activities of a host of government officials.
Now, those things Irve just mentioned are in the
record, they are attached to the affidavits that were submitted on March 30, 1970, in the District Court.

Those

affidavits are referred to in the Appendix at page 12, and
we’re talking about Exhibit 19 to the Horton deposition and
Exhibit B to the Pecola deposition.
We just don’t think that the claims of credit can
be justified by the facts.
For these reasons, and those set forth in our brief,
Mr. Chief Justice, we submit that the judgment of the D. C.
Circuit should be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Flannery.

Very well, Mr. Jordan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS 11« FLANNERY, ESQ„ ,
OH DEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENTS
MR. FLANNERY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
QUESTION;

,

Mr. Flannery has the amount of this

award been fixed?
MR* FLANNERY:

It has not, Your Honor,

That has

specifically been left by the Court of Appeals for a later
determination.
QUESTION:

But was the -- the hours we re pretty

well defined, weren't they, by the Court of Appeals, as to
what would be included and what wouldn't?
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

Yes, they were, Your Honor.

So what was the total hours?

MR. FLANNERY: The total hours were something over
four thousand and -QUESTION:

Forty-four hundred and something is

what the claim says.
QUESTION:
then?

Well, they had just approved your claim,

You claimed 4400 hours or something like that.
MR. FLANNERY:

We claimed 4400 hours, and the

Court of Appeals indicated that half of that should not be
recovered, because they thought it would be appropriate to
divide the award between the government and the —
QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but the hours — the

23

total hours -that they approved were 4400 and then they just
say the company should just pay half of that*
MR. FLAHIJERY:

We 11 , I can’t -- and they didn't

really get into the question of the hours as such.

They said

the question of the hours and the skill and the other points
would be deferred for a later -- for later consideration.

But

it did say one-half of the total efforts that were taken in
preparing the case for the Court of Appeals should be awarded
against Alyeska; yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Was this to be left up to the District

Court in the first instance?
MR. FLANNERY;
QUESTION;

It was, Your Honor.

Yes.

QUESTION; Did you claim an amount?
MR. FLANNERY;
QUESTION;

Ho, we did not.

And the rest of it was to be awarded —

or was it to be awarded against the government?
MR# FLANNERY;

No, it's borne by the organizations

involved, The Wilderness Society, ~~
QUESTION:

Nothing against the government?

MR, FLANNERY:
that.

— and the lawyers will swallow

Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
QUESTION;

Right.
The statutes forbid any levy against

the government, do they not?

24
MR. FLANNERYs

17© did not go behind the statute,

we accepted that as a prohibition, and made the contention
that we thought it was fair in this case to award the entire
four thousand hours against Alyeska.

The Court disagreed

with us on that, and said they thought half an award would be
appropriate*,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR„ FLANNERYs

Listening to my good friend Mr.

Jordan's argument, and reading his brief, you — at least I
sort of get the picture of a poor harmless soul who was walking
past the U„ S. Courthouse one day, and. a big hook came in, and
the next thing he knew he was taxed with fees.
And that's really not -- not the way this happened.
Just briefly, to go back a little bits
The oil companies that Mr. Jordan represents
discovered and got .rights to this vast amount of oil on the
North Slope of Alaska, and then they had to determine how to
get it to market.
They looked, and they considered various plans,
and they determined that the way they would like to do it is
to construct a hot oil pipeline across the entire length of
Alaska, and then to load the oil, when it got to the bottom
of Alaska, on marine tankers, and then ship the oil to market.
That was their decision.

Nobody told them to build

it that way, no one told them they had to do it that way.

25
They then set about determining how they would go
about getting permission to do that, since most of the lands
that would be crossed would be federal lands.
The record clearly indicates that Alyeska recognized
that the statute — and, my God, it's hard to imagine a
clearer statute — the statute says on its face that rights of-way will be limited to fifty feet»

Not only doss it say

that, it then says that the Secretary cannot grant rights-ofway under any other provision.
Then, if that isn’t enough, it says:

And if he does,

and if a right-of-way is limited — or is issued that violates
the statute, the oil company that receives the statute —
receives the right-of-way will forfeit it.
This was the statute on its face.
QUESTION:

Well, if it’s all that clear, why did it

take 4400 hours to —
MR* FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, —

— figure out what the law was?

[Laughter. ]
MR. FLANNERY;

We think the case should have

ended in April of 1970, when we received the preliminary
injunction.

When Alyeska came in, it filed a, I think, about

a 200-page brief, finally, ultimately, trying to justify why
the statute didn’t say what it said,
It went -— passed through 200 years of history of

2G
internal Interior Department regulations.
QUESTION:

Well, I can see on your theory why it

would take your opponent a good many hours to prove that the
statute didn't mean v/hat it said.

But we're talking about

your time.
MR. FLANITERYj

Yes.

And I think we had to more or

less do the same thing, to show not only did it say what it
said on its face, but it meant it.
I think the Court of Appeals, in its opinion,
indicated why we had to do that.

Judge Wright, after saying

that the statute was as clear as it could be, said:

But it

may well be that fifty feet couldn't have meant fifty feet,
and we will go beyond.
And the Court went beyond all of the other facts,
it looked at the Interior Department regulations.

Indeed,

Your Honor, it found that on the face of the regulations —
not only on the face of the statute — the kinds of permits
contemplated here were banned.

It found no long-standing

administrative practice.
And we anticipated, and it happened, that the oil
companies, with their resources, joined up with the government
combed the field offices of the Interior Department around
the country, looking for any shred of evidence that might
give them an indication that this was a long-standing practice
There was none.

When the record finally Game down.

27
after these three years, Hr» Jordan and his — and the
government, came up with actually five documented instances
of this kind of permit that they claimed constituted a long-*
standing practice, and none of them before 1960.
I think the total miles involved were around fifty
or sixty miles.
But, for some reason, the oil companies did not want
to go to Congress.

At any time, in the three years that this

litigation was filed, the oil companies were free to go to
Congress.

Ho one stopped them from doing it.

theme.of Wilderness Society I ,

In fact, the

is that this was a prescrip"

tion that was directed to the oil industry, and Congress
specifically said if the oil industry wants more land it
should come back to us and tell us why.
And Alyeska was not compelled to go to the Secretary
of Interior, it could have read, as we read, the preliminary
injunction in 1970, and at that point gone to Congress.
It could have gone to Congress at any time, and
therefore this litigation certainly didn’t burden the courts.
The only people that really burdened the courts were Alyeska.
They were the ones who insisted on litigating this all the
way through, right up to this Court.
This Court, I might note, denied certiorari the
first time around four days after receiving our opposition.
And yet the litigation was long and prolonged because of

20

Alyeska's decision, not ours.
And the real issue here is:

Who should bear the

economic burden of compelling Alyeska and the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System to comply with the law?
And the question really is one between A3.veska
and Exxon and ARCO and Amerada-Hess on one side, and the
Wilderness Society and the Environmental Defense Fund and the
Friends of the Earth? and who, between those two, should be
compelled to bear at least part of the economic burden of
this litigation.
In our position — in our -- Yes?
QUESTION:

If, given all your positions in the case,

the Secretary had acted properly and performed his duty on
your theory, the matter would have been disposed of a long
time ago, wouldn't it?
MR. FLANNERY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I think

if the Secretary had acted, as he should have, back in 1970,
the litigation would have been over, I think? and certainly
if Alyeska had acted correctly and listened to the preliminary
injunction, the litigation would have been over.
QUESTION: But for eighteen months, at least, the
Secretary was, from your point of view again, in error on his
own, wasn't he?
MR„ FLANNERYs Well, he was the only party before
the court, and, needless to say, we were not anxious to invite

29
Mr. Jordan and his lav; firm and the oil companies into the
lawsuit.

But we knew they would come when push came to shove.
But certainly the Secretary, in the time that the

preliminary injunction was in effect, at any time could have
gone to Congress, and Mr. Jordan and his clients could have
also.

They were not prohibited in any way.
In fact, I think the clear purport of the statutory

scheme was for Mr, Jordan and his clients to go to Congress.
We don't really think that the question of technical,
legal liability is a sine qua non for the award in this case.
It certainly was not the basis on which the Court of Appeals
proceeded, and we think correctly so.
But even on that point, the Mineral Leasing Act of
1920 has a clear forfeiture provision which, in a very real
sense, put a direct legal liability on Mr, Jordan and his
clients.
QUESTION! Would this record show, in the present
state, what proportion of the total of 4400 hours of legal
work had the impact that you argue for on the actions of
Congress, the subsequent actions of Congress?
MR. FLANNERY;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Your Honor, yes, in

A substantial part?

MR. FLANNERY;

Yes, I think a substantial part,

The last item in the Joint Appendix is the actual bill of
costs that xtfas submitted to the Court of Appeals, together

30

with an affidavit from roe* which explained the various
segments of the work, and what the various elements related
to,
I think even here, thought, it's important to focus
on something.

Mr. Jordan indicates that the NEPA issues,

in so far as they were litigated, really were irrelevant,
that we didn’t prevail.

Admittedly, we didn’t prevail,

because we prevailed on a threshold question.
But, again, The Wilderness Society and the groups
I represented, when the Secretary announced, in May of 1972,
that he was going to go ahead and issue permits, notwithstand­
ing the preliminary injunction, and notwithstanding the
limitation in the Mineral Leasing Act, we immediately filed
a motion for partial summary judgment solely on the Mineral
Leasing Act ground, which was the earliest time we could do
it.
We said, we believe this is dispositive of this
case; we request the Court to rule on it promptly, that
Alyeska and the government have had three years now to figure
out why fifty feet doesn’t mean fifty feet, and we are
satisfied to go on that issue alone.
Alyeska, which, by this time, had intervened, and,
as Mr. Jordan has indicated, very vigorously intervened,
filed a motion the next day and argued;

No, don't do that.?

require The Wilderness Society and Environmental Defense Fund

31

to litigate all the issues, require them to litigate the
NEPA issues as well.
And specifically, Nr. Jordan said — not the
government, not the State of Alaska, but Hr. Jordan in his
papers —- that unless the NEPA issues are briefed and argued,
the Court will not have a basis for determining even the
Mineral Leasing Act issue? that you cannot determine the
Mineral Leasing Act issue in the abstract, you need to get the
whole technical background and development of this entire
case.
And,he submitted, when you have that and when you tell
The Wilderness Society to submit a NEPA brief, we are then con­
vinced that you will rule out their arguments on the Mineral
Leasing Act.
And so even on that issue, we were told to litigate
at Mr. Jordan's insistence.
Now, Mr. Jordan says that we did not prevail on the
NEPA issues.

We didn't prevail on the NEPA issues for

precisely the reason that we have suggested to the Court:
that if the Mineral Leasing Act were indeed a threshold
bar, the Court would be, in a sense, giving an abstract
opinion on an issue of no significance, because Congress would
have the final determination.

And that's what ultimately

happened.
I might say that there are questions raised frequently

32

about delays, and whether the environmentalists caused the
delays .in the Alaska Pipeline,

But the record indicates that

the environmentalists are responsible for none or hardly any
delay.

The initial suit was filed in the beginning of 1970,

the earliest possible time.

The oil companies and the

Secretary were put on notice that both the Mineral Leasing
Act and NEPA imposed some fairly serious obligations on them,
that they ought to adhere to before going ahead with this
project,
Mr, Jordan skips from 1970 to 1972, but there was a
significant series of events that occurred in early 1971,
when the Interior Department published a draft impact
statement, in January of 1971,
The thought there was that that would serve as a
basis for the go-ahead on the project, and that there might
be some fixing up of the statement as a result of comments,
but by March or so of 1971 there would be a go-ahead.
That statement was given by the Interior Department
to Mr, Jordan’s clients prior to its publication.

Many of the

comments about the impact of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System
were softened.

There was tremendous criticism of that impact

statement, as a result, by our organizations, by other federal
government agencies; and, as a result, it was not really until
February of 1971 that the Interior Department and, I submit,
Mr, Jordan's clients got down to the serious business of

33
grappliVtg with this, the real complexities of this project.
So really a whole year was lost from March of 1970
to around February of 1971, and it's a year for which these
respondents are in no way responsible.
And then from 1971, as I indicated, to 1972, there
was the work being done on the environmental impact statement.
We don't claim that •— credit for the good things that carae,
and there are a lot of good things that came through that
effort.

In tire course of this litigation we deposed the

individual who was placed in charge of the drafting effort
by the Secretary of the Interior, a geologist named Dr. David
Breu, and I have never found or met a finer public servant
and a more dedicated man in my life, and he received
accolades from us as well as from Mr, Jordan's clients„
We had some problems with the work that was completed,
but there couldn't have been a man who worked harder or who
had the public interest more at heart.
But then when that impact statement was issued, as
I have indicated, why, we presented our views to the Secretary
about what we thought still was wrong with it, we were
perfectly willing for the litigation to end at that point and
for Congress to do its job,
We submitted the papers, but the oil companies wanted
to keep the case in the courts.
Ultimately, we prevailed on a Mineral Leasing Act

34

issue, and Mr. Jordan says in his brief and says today that
it was on a technical issue that v/as of no importance.
What difference does fifty feet mean?
Well, X think the subsequent history, if anything,
demonstrates whafc the importance of it was.

Congress didn't

say, My God, fifty feet is absurd, we don't care; take a
hundred, take a thousand, just build this thing and get the
oil down.
There are ten months of debate, and with all of the
pressures that were placed, and realistic ones, all of ‘due
knowledge of the impending energy problem, tire decision to
*
build the Trans-Alaska Pipeline without further litigation
passed by the Senate, by a 49-49 vote, with Vice President
Agnew breaking the tie; and it passed in the House by a
vote of 221-to-190.
And even then, the proponents of that legislation -it certainly was an unusual legislation? but even then they
said that the delays that have already occurred as a result
of this litigation, which permitted the Interior Department
and Alyeska finally to get down to work and do what they
should have done all along, convinces us that now we can go
ahead.
So I don't take the subsequent legislation that
came out of the Congress as a defeat for the environmental
groups, that is precisely what they had been asking for all

35

along.

They had been asking that there be a real and considered

judgment of what the implications of this project were.

Ue

got that.
.And they were asking that the matter be referred to
Congress, as Congress has indicated it wished in tie Mineral
Leasing Act of 1920.

We got that.

And there's been no further dispute.
is being built.

The pipeline

We wish the oil companies well, and we do

hope that it will be done in an environmentally responsible
manner? and presume that it will.
QUESTION;

The pipeline that will be built differs

will you tell us -- in what way from the one that was
originally proposed?
MR«, FLANNERY;

Well, the one that was originally

proposed was a -- really, it’s hard to say whether anything
was originally proposed. What the oil companies essentially
went to the Interior Department with was a map, and a line
where they planned to go, and essentially what they said was;
that we'll get out in the field, and out in the field we'll
be able to make adjustments.
Rut the principal differences were, No. 1, that all
of the river crossings were to be buried, and that would have
had tremendous erosion problems, and it would have been
significant ruptures along the line.

All of the overland

portion, with the exception of about five percent, was to be

buried.

Mow it's wore — was to be buried? now about 55

percent or so will be elevated.
There was very little understanding of the topography
along the route of potential landslides and avalanches? and,
of course, the most significant problem and one, by the way,
that remains a problem, one that concerns everyone still
greatly, including, I’m sure, the oil companies, .is that the
southern two-thirds of the Alaska Pipeline route is seisrnically
about the most active area in the world.

In fact, the

southern terminus, Valdez, was destroyed in 1964 by a major
earthquake.
The Interior Department impact statement indicates
that there will be

will be -- a major earthquake along the

pipeline route sometime during its life.
Nov/, the time that has gone by has at least
permitted Alyeska to prepare contingency plans and certain
defenses in areas v/here they know there are potentially
active faults? the most obvious one is the

Denali fault,

which everyone has been aware of for a while,,
The frightening thing, though, is that the Interior
Department's statement indicates that there may be other
potentially — potentially seismic active faults all along
the route that cannot be predicted, so we may be in for
some very serious problems in the years ahead, if one of
those should become active.

37
And# by the way# the conclusion is that if there is
a major rupture, there will be a minimum of about 60,000
barrels of oil that will spill into the lakes and the streams
before preventive measures can be taken.
QUESTION:

Have there been any engineering changes

to — in anticipation of the possible spill.?
MR. FLANNERY;

Yes.

As I said# Your Honor, I think

there have been# certainly with respect to the Denali fault
and other areas.

There have been protections that have been

built in.
There also was, I think# a much greater knowledge of
the permafrost problems# of the problems with vegetation, of
how to restore vegetation, which is important nonly only for
the environment but also for the integrity of the pipeline,
because these pressures can be just enormous if you start
interfering with the permafrost# you have melting going one
way and then sort of coming back against the pipeline.
And it’s still an amazingly complex project and one
that’s going to take all of the efforts of Mr. Jordan’s clients
to cope with, and we sincerely hope they'll be able to do it.
I think another problem# which I might mention, is
‘-i

the

well# it's called the Trans“Alaska Pipeline, and that

certainly is what it is.

Once it makes it through

if I

could just have a minute — once the pipeline makes it through
the entire route the problems really only begin, because then

38

it has to be loaded on to these major super tankers
again, the final impact statement says that

,

and

and this is

now when all the study is over — that in the average year
of the pipeline we can expect 140,000 barrels of oil to
pollute the northeast Pacific, which is the last ana really
major unpolluted ocean area in the world.
And that's only an average figure.

One super

tanker crash will spill a million barrels.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS M. FLANNERY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR* FLANNERY:

-- Resumed

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The petitioner does not in its brief, and does not
seriously here today, question the power of the court below
to make the award of fees in this case.

Nor does it really

seem to be arguing that the factors cited by the Court, as
applied to this case, do not justify or do not support the
award of fees.
And what really appears to be the principal argument,
it certainly seems to be true in the brief, and I think it
was the thrust of the argument today, was that somehow if this
decision to award fees in this case is allowed to stand, the
lower courts will be set off in all sorts of directions,
issuing all sorts of unpredictable opinions awarding fees.
And I respectfully suggest that the lower courts
are entitled to a little more confidence than that»

Indeed,

a hundred years ago, when this Court first extended and
recognized the validity of an award of fees in the common fund
cases, in Trustees v, Greenough, that very argument was made,
that if you permit lower courts who are familiar with the

40

particular facts of a particular case to decide that fees
should be awarded, we will be set off in a parade of horrors.
QUESTIONS

Well, when that case was decided, there

was a substantial body of precedent in State courts, in the
exercise of equity powers, on the theory that there was a
benefit conferred or a fund created, was there not?
MR. FLANNERY:

Mr. Chief Justice, what the Court

really looked to was the traditional English practice -—
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, FLANNERY:

— and most of the cases cited

were the traditional equity powers of the English court.
And, I submit that that same equity power, as exercised —
it is really the same power that was exercised by the Court
in this case.
QUESTION:

I'm a little puzzled by your prior

statement, your earlier statement, at the outset, that you
didn't think your friend was disagreeing too much with you.
I thought he had disagreed with you most violently and said
there was utterly no precedent whatever, of any kind, for
the allowance of attorneys' fees in cases of this kind.
MR, FLANNERY:
error.

Well, if he did, he's certainly in

And I didn’t understand him to say that.

In fact,

I think he conceded that there ~ and in response to Mr.
Justice Stewart's question, this Court has not directly
passed on the private attorney general theory as such,» but

41
certainly there is extensive precedent in the lower federal
courts —
QUESTION;

Yes,, but what precedent in this Court?

MR. FLANNERY;
Your Honor.

And I certainly agree with that also.

Just as in Greenough, there was no precedent in

this Court for recognizing an award of fees in the context
of the common fund.
But I think they’re the sane considerations, really,
that gave rise to the award in Greenough, apply here.
what the Court was sayings

Really,

Is it fair, in circumstances such

as that, when one individual has really had to take the burden
of a litigation that goes far beyond any interest of his own,
is it fair for that individual to bear the full burden of the
litigation, when there's an equitable mechanism available for
spreading the cost?
And I believe that's exactly the same factor that the
Court of Appeals below recognized in this situation.

And I

think the Court of Appeals recognized, and I think the record
here demonstrates amply, that this is a unique case, this is
a truly extraordinary case.

The issues are extremely complex,

the litigating burden that the respondents, for no economic
benefits, had to assume was immense.

And the results of the

litigation were beneficial, and they were not a benefit that
in any way adhered to the economic gain of the respondents.
Now, a hundred years ago, much the same argument

42

that Mr. Jordan has made today was made, and this is what
Justice Bradley said:

A just respect for the eminent judges

under whose direction many of these cases have been administer­
ed would lead to the conclusion that allowances of this kind,
if made with moderation and a jealous regard to the rights of
those who are .interested, are not only admissible but agree­
able to the principles of equity and justice.
y

And I submit that that is precisely what happened
in this case, and that the court with the greatest familiarity
of this record, and the court which struggled with this case
over a period of five months in reaching the decision in
Wilderness Societ/ I, was it correct in ruling that this was
an appropriate case for award of fees.
QUESTION: Do you think the equity powers that you
speak of are broad enough so that if you had, hypothetically,
a case where a volunteer non-profit organization brought a
suit, kept the litigation ■— had a litigation that kept on
going for many, many months, with an extraordinary amount of
time involved, that then it was found to have had no basis
at all to the case, and all the relief denied, do you think
the Court would have the authority and appropriately charge
fees against the plaintiff in the action?
MR. FLANNERY:

I can‘t —- there is, of course,

traditional powers, under the obdurate behavior standard or
also for a misuse of court processes, the courts have always

43
had this power to punish, and it really is a power to punish,
for frivolous litigation.
I would say, to the extent that that sort of
litigation was not frivolous, but was not, in the end, proven
to be meritorious, the traditional principles of the American
rule, nothing else outstanding, would probably dictate that
each party bear its own fees.
And I think that what the Court of Appeals in this
case said was that the very principles that stand behind the
American rule, which is that there aren’t to be barriers toward
litigating meritorious interests, would permit an award of
fees in this case, but would not necessarily require — and
really shouldn't -— the wholesale abandonment of the American
rule in every other context.
And I think what we're talking about here, Mr. Chief
Justice, is a truly exceptional case.
QUESTION?

Well, then it just boils down to the

deeper pocket under your analysis, doesn't it?
MR. FLANNERY?

No

I think what the Court said was;

I don't think so, Your Honor.
Look at these individuals

who had no economic gain at all and look at the position they
were in, that they had to step into the breach to get the lav?
enforced, for no economic interest at all.
That, combined with the other factors cited by the
Court, led it to the conclusion that if there was an equitable

44
way of shifting some of that cost, it could do so.
Then, on the other side of the coin, it looked to see
who that cost could be shifted to.

It determined that Alyeska,

for many of the factors I have discussed this morning, was
certainly a responsible party in the litigation, who really
was responsible for many of the issues that were raised in
the litigation, was very active.
Then the last thing the Court looked to was:

Now,

if we do, in light of those factors, shift fees from the
respondents to the petitioner, is there any way that the
shifting of fees could act as a deterrent to Alyeska or
anyone else similarly situated to litigate its interest in
court?
And the Court said no.
QUESTION:

But that was

But supposing the procedural history

here had been almost exactly the opposite, where it had been
determined that your client had been wrong at every juncture,
and then Alyeska comes in and asks for attorneys'

fees at

the close of the situation?
Nov/, I take it, your client probably isn't insolvent.
Would your clients' resources be tests by the same standards
that Alyeska’s were, in determining whether or not fees
could be awarded?
MR» FLANNERY:

Well, I think here you're talking

about really a different interest? you’re not talking about

45
the purpose, you're talking about a very different purpose of
an award.

Here you're saying that if you have litigation

where one party wins and one party loses, should the party
that wins be awarded fees?
And I think the answer, under the traditional
American rule, is no.
And what we're talking about here is a very limited
exception, where you do have, when the case is over, the
party which had to intervene simply because the law was not
being upheld for anyone else, should that party, as in this
case, compared with Alyeska, be forced to bear that burden?
And I think the -QUESTIONs

But almost any ~~ almost any party can

come in and say the law just isn't being enforced, I'm going
to enforce it.
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's pretty broad.

By the way, who's going to

assume you win, where

does the fee go?
MR. FLANNERY:

And when the — if it's awarded, and

MR. FLANNERY:

NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund cases worked, the
fee is either made out to the client itself, the Court
indicating that the fee ia to go to the lawyer or to -QUESTION: Well, is the client under any obligation

MR. FLANNERY:

No obligation to pay a fee, no, Your

MR. FLANNERY:

No, he would pass it on to the

QUESTION:

I know, but the organisation would

MR. FLANNERY:

MR, FLANNERY: The Internal Revenue Service has been
presented with the question, and has ruled that awards of fees

Social Policy are appropriate, and it doesn't affect the basic
charitable nature of the organization.
QUESTION: Wall, that would ~
MR. FLANNERY:

But, of course, as I indicated, the

individual lawyers will not be profiting from it,
QUESTION:

That may be another question that probably

is irrelevant, that if none of the lawyers receive any of this,
and if the lawyers have all been paid for their services, then,
as a matter of arithmetic, I suppose the Center will be
receiving more money as a result of this litigation than the
Center paid out to the lawyers who conducted it.
MR, FLANNERY:

Well, I think that the standard, and

48

certainly this is the standard that the Fifth Circuit has
reached in a number of Civil Rights cases, going over the
years, is that the appropriate standard should be the value
of the legal services, taking in a lot of other considerations.
And in a situation such as this, if lawyers are
willing to take on these cases for less remuneration, and
certainly the remuneration I received would be a very small
portion of what Mr. Jordan would receive for arguing the
opposite side of the case, that that should not be the standard,
really, that would determine the award.
Because, otherwise, it would really be the poorer
the group and the more sacrificial the lawyer, the less the
award would be.

And that, I think, would present very, very

difficult problems.
QUESTION:

But the ancient equity doctrine that

was first articulated here a hundred years ago was always
based on restoring the expense of litigation, was it not?
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

No one made any profit out of it, except

in the sense that lawyers got fees, but no one had any
margin in the old equity rule.
MR. FLANNERY:

But what we5 re talking about here

is, I think, a real economic burden, and the question is, if
you have lawyers who are taking on tinis case, as I did here,
for substantially less than what they would make —* and

49
certainly, as a father of five, I can say it was substantially
less —
QUESTION:

But that gets us into some rather

subjective factors.
MR. FLANNERY:

Well, I think what the Courts are

trying to do is get away from the subjective factors by
simply valuing the legal service, and not getting into this
question about just how much this salary was paid, and how
much the secretaries were paid, and how much the typextfrifcers
cost, and how much it cost to heat the room where we had to
answer the 200-page brief.
QUESTION:

And I think that the ~

But if the rationale is to, not to deter

litigation, I would think that the answer you just gave to the
Chief Justice does not really support your proposition.
It may seem perhaps a harsh result, but if in fact lawyers
are willing to bring these kinds of lawsuits for less than
the going rate, the fact that they don’t receive ordinary
counsel fees apparently will not deter them.
MR. FLANNERY:

No, I think it seriously does.

There's no question that this litigation was one that was —
one that the groups themselves had to think very seriously
about, knowing what they were getting into? and I can certainly
say from a personal nature that I certainly had to think very
seriously about whether I was willing to take it on under
the conditions that I knew I'd be working under, knowing that

50
the nature, and this —
QUESTIONs Well, hos»; will it deter —- how will
refusal of counsel fee here deter further litigation, when
the money, if it’s forthcoming for counsel fees is going to
go to the organisation, not to the lawyer?

They are still

going to be asking lawyers to take tilings on, just like they
asked you.
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTIONs

Yes, that's right.
And if they can get them, they can

get them? if they can't, they can't.
How is the money going to help with respect to
further litigation?
MR. FLANNERY:

Well, that ~

QUESTION; As far as lav/yers'
MR. FLANNERY:

Well, the money is going to help,

because at least it will
QUESTION s

fees are concerned?

it will --

So that it can pay the next lawyer who

charges no more than you?
MR, FLANNERY:

That's essentially right.

But I

think it also permits the organisation —
QUESTION:

That hasn't got. much to do with this

case, for that matter,
MR, FLANNERY:

I don't think it does? but I think

that the fee in this case, which I think is based on this
case alone, is one that really talks about a real economic

51
burden, either that a lawyer gave up or didn't.

But we're

talking about, you know, the actual facts.
1 think that in so far as what's going to be done
with the money, it certainly would be possible for the lawyers
and for the group simply to say that the lawyers would
«

receive whatever extra money they would gat when they won
the case, and therefore would be made whole.
It just happens that lawyers with the Center, as
lawyers with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
have agreed that they will not take the extra money.
But I isally don't see why that should be the
distinction as to what the actual award should be.
QUESTIONS

You might --

QUESTION:

And you'd rather have it go directly

to the organization, rather than to you -MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

I do not -~

— even if you gave what was left after

taxes to the organization?

<

MR. FLANNERY: Either way the organization will get
as much as I can give it, and I won't take anything.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Your thesis might be equally applicable

in cases where the government brings an action, let's say,
antitrust or other enforcement in some economic area, and
the government then sought fees from the losing party and made

52

the claim that,generally known among, in the profession,
that lawyers in the Department of Jus tiers are working for less
than they could get outside, and -therefore the differential
should go into the government's coffers»

But has any court

ever allowed the government that kind of cost of litigation
anywhere?
MR. FLANNERY;

No, but I think that the government

is the Attorney General, and I think that it is generally
understood that when the government brings litigation, of
course — and we're talking about really a solid base, there
are taxes which are going to support the government lawyers,
there are pension funds, there's hospitalisation, there's
retirement? you're talking about a very different situation
for a lawyer, even though, obviously, lawyers and career
lawyers are making sacrifices.
They are a very different situation from a private
lawyer, who is really moving into the place of the government
for one reason or another, who is then shouldering the burden?
and I think that this is, this decision in this particular
case is designed to lighten that burden»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

Mr. Jordan, do you have anything further?

53
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. JORDAN, III, RRg-. ,
OIT BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JORDANs

A few further observations, Mr. Chief

Jus tice.
It seems to be difficult to persuade Mr. Flannery
of our good faith, but I hope I'll do a better job with the
Court.
The Court of Appeals said that our position was
taken in good faith, in view of the long administrative
practice,
I'd just like to point out a few additional things.
The practice of special land-use permits was
supported by opinions of the Attorney General, going back
into the 1870's.

The Department of Interior had regulations

on special land-use permits for many years.
Perhaps most significant, in 1923, three years after
the Mineral Leasing Act was enacted, there began a practice of
giving in fact more land than the statute literally allowed
for the purpose of p^imping stations.

That had been done for

approximately fifty years when this litigation came along.
That had been codified in the Interior Regulations, and had
been expanded to include not only pumping stations but other
necessary facilities.
Now, that's an element of our good faith.
I would also point out that the Court of Appeals

54
accepted this argument with respect to pumping stations and
rejected the argument of the respondents on that point.
And finally I would say that in 1970 the Ninth
Circuit had decided a case, Sierra Club vs. nickel, 433 Fed 2d
24, which was subsequently before this Court under the name of
Sierra Club vs. Morton, on the basis of a standing issue —
resolved on the basis of a standing issue.
The Ninth Circuit had allowed as an alternative
holding the Department of Agriculture to tack, if you will,
special land-use permits onto a specific acreage limitation
for recreation developments in the Mineral King Development.
Now, Mr. Justice Blackmun had something to say
about that when the case was up before this Court, but the
point was that in 1970, the relevant time, we were relying on
that kind of opinion in the Ninth Circuit on a very closely
related point.
There have been some other discussions here about
relative portions of the fees for various activities,

I'd

like to just re-emphasize a point I made in my principal
argument.
The benefits which Mr, Flannery claims were benefits
of the preliminary injunction.

Now, presumably, no fees were

sought for that, because there was no deep pocket there to go
after.

Alyeska was not a party to the litigation at the time

of the preliminary injunction, did not become so for many

55

months.
But most of the fees claimed, and certainly the
fees claimed relating to the NEPA issues, are of a nature
having nothing to do with the benefits involving changing
the pipeline construction.

That had already taken place,

largely, by March of 1972 when the final environmental
statement came out.
And most of that related to the trans-Canadian
alternative.
Now, in the District Court, the transcript of
August 14 and 15, 1972, when these issues were argued, just
before lunch one of those days Judge Hart asked the
respondents herej

What do you really want?

want this Court to do in the way of an order?

What; is it you
Come back

after lunch find tell me.
And that’s the transcript of that proceeding, which
is referred to in the Appendix at 31.
After lunch the respondents came back and said;

What

we really want here is an addendum to the final environmental
impact statement dealing with these common corridor pipeline
arrangements through Canada and Alaska.
That’s what the whole 1JEPA exercise was about.
That’s what respondents were seeking at that time.

And that

has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with bringing about
changes in the construction of the pipeline.

56

One more point.
With respect to who brought about these changes,
the record's not very satisfactory on this, and the reason,
of course, is that this thing was initially determined by
the Court of Appeals in the first instance.

It was not before

the District Court.
And the record that we have here was not designed to
shed light on the attorneys' fees issues.
But if you were to go back to the record you would
find document after document after document that supports the
?

?

notion that people like Oscar Ferens and Ruben Caccidorian
of the Geological Survey were the people who brought about
the changes on burying and elevation.

That Bob Page of the

Geological Survey was the fellow who was in there saying
time after time again:

You’ve got to more closely examine

the seismic, the earthquake problem.
And there’s example after example of that that
could be given.
So the idea that there’s a great contribution here
is really one of self-congratulation, I think, and would not
be supported by a detailed examination of the record.
With respect to the powers of equity, we’re not
challenging the power of this Court, we’re not talking about
power, we’re talking about wisdom here?
equity power be exercised?

How should the

57
We say it should not. be exercised against the party
who was guilty of no wrongdoing# and we say further that it
should not be exercised to create the kind of open-ended
private attorney general's exception# which is reflected in
the Court of Appeals opinion.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you# gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon# at 1:25 o'clock# p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
