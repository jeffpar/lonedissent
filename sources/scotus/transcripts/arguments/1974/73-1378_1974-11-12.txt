PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1377, Russell E. Train against the City of
New York and No. 73-1378, Russell E. Train against Campaign
Clean Water.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
These cases are here on writs of certiorari to
the Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the
Fourth Circuit.
Each is an action seeking to compel the Adminis­
trator of the Environmental Protection Agency to increase
allotments he

has made under Title II of the Water

Pollution Control Act Amendments.
I had best describe the statutory process which
is deeply involved in this case.
This Act provides federal funds to pay 75 percent
of the cost to state municipalities of the construction of
sewage treatment facilities and the act — the funding
process operates in several stages.
Firstj Congress must enact an authorization for

H
appropriations of a certain size.
Novi, that is not an appropriation.

It is more of

a statement of intent to appropriate at a later date and it
begins this process.
Second, the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, working within that authorization, allots
various amounts to states on the formula suggested by the
Act.

When that has been done and the allotments have been

made, the states make proposals for construction of water
treatment facilities, sewage treatment facilities that they
think are most pressing and if these are approved as meeting
the criteria, that approval by the Administrator constitutes
an obligation of the United States and all that remains to
be done is' for the grantees to make the expenditures.
Congress appropriates the funds and they are paid over to the
grantees.
Now, the issues we have today are two and the
first is whether the President, acting through the Admin™
istrator, has discretion at the second stage of this process,
that is, the allotment stage, to allot the states amounts
less than Congress has authorized to be appropriated.
And second, if he has such discretion, whether
that discretion is revievrable in the courts.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
held that there is no discretion at the allotment stage but

5
there is some discretion at the obligation stage} the
approval of the plant.
The Fourth Circuit assumed that there was
discretion at the allotment stage because the Respondents
claimed it below in that case, conceded it and the District
Court had found it and the Court of Appeals remanded for a
trial de novo of whether, assuming the discretion,

the

Administrator had abused it or exceeded it.
In a word, I think everybody agrees in this case
that the President has discretion at some stage of this
process.
Now, I would like to make it very clear at the
outset to remove any element of drama from this case, we
are not here asserting —
QUESTION:

Drama or grammar?

MR. BORK:

I may eliminate both, Mr. Justice

Stewart, but I meant to say drama.
QUESTION: D-R-A-M-A?
MR. BORK:

Cor’rect.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

I will try not to eliminate grammar as

I go along.
We are not asserting any constitutional power of
the President In this case.

There Is here no element of

confrontation between the President and the Congress.

We

6
rely entirely upon the discretion Congress gave the President
intentionally in the Act and in that, we are supported by
Respondents’ concessions that some discretion is built into
the Act, although they do not agree with us or, indeed, some­
times with each other about how or when it is to be exercised
QUESTION:

This case, in other words, everybody

seems to agree, is a matter of statutory construction.
MR. BORK:

That Is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

QUESTION:

Rather than any kind of a constitutional

question, implicit or explicit.
MR. BORK:

That is correct.

We are making no

constitutional argument.
I should also say that these statutes under which
Impoundment has occurred in the past — and in many of itfhich
I think impoundment Is no longer occurring, come in a wide
variety of shapes and forms and processes so that these
cases today before us are quite unlikely to settle the issue
of withholding of funds under other statutory programs.
This statute is unique.
Well, to get to these cases.

Congress authorized

the appropriation of not-to-ecxeed $5 billion for fiscal year
1973 and $6 billion for fiscal year 197^.
The Administrator of EPA, at the direction of
the President, allotted for those years respectively $2 and
$3 billion, a total allotment of $5 billion as opposed to

7
the $11 billion authorized for appropriation.
Wow, I should also say that the remainder, the
administration's position is, that the remainder of these
allotments will be made in the future so that this ease
concerns a rate of spending rather than the total amount to
be spent on this program over time.
I will address first the issue raised by the City
of New York, which is the stage of the process at which
discretion may be exercised and then I will discuss the
issue raised by Campaign Clean Water, the case from the
Fourth Circuit, the scope and reviewability of the dis­
cretion.
We think it is clear that the President’s dis­
cretion is to be authorized at the allotment stage and we
have for that the rather mundane reason that that is x*hat
the statute says and we agree with Campaign Clean Water on
that point and disagree with City of New York on that point.
Now, City of New York makes much play of the fact
that in the debates, various Congressmen who 'were engaged
at that point in stressing the legitimacy of the President's
impoundment of funds under this statute.
However, in stressing that discretion that the
President was to be given, used words like "discretion over
spending," "discretion over obligation," and it is almost
entirely from that slim foundation that the Respondent tries

8
to argue that Congress deliberately ruled out discretion at
the allotment stage.
We think that in the face of the explicit
language of the statute that argument is altogether too
thin and it is worth noting, I think, that this is a very
natural way to talk about impoundment issues.
Indeed, public discussion generally talks about
the President's ability to control spending, even when,
under a technical statute, the

discretion is authorized at

some other stage than the actual payment of the money.
And that is an accurate

way to speak, because when

the President directs the Administrator not to allot the
whole sum, the result, of course, is a deferral of

obli­

gations and a deferral of spending as well and that is what
the discretion is all about, ultimately, the federal spending
So naturally, the Congressmen talk about it in
those terms.

And we can’t place all that much weight on

their failure in these debates constantly to use the quite
technical terms of a very novel process, which this Act
contains.
What we do know, unmistakeably, from the debate and
the legislative history is that Congress intended to give
the President discretion and that it did that, its vehicle
for giving discretion, Terere the amendments proposed by
REpresentative Ilarsha, who was the chief sponsor of the Act

and those amendments were proposed to Section 205-a and
Section 207.
Now, Section 205a, which was amended for this
purpose, is an allotment provision and it is plain to us,
therefore, that the discretion given is in making allotments.
As originally drafted, the House Bill said this,
in Section 205a of the Allotment Provision, it said, "All
sums to be appropriated pursuant to Section 207 shall be
allotted by the Administrator," and Section 207 merely
authorized the appropriation of the amount.
Now, that language about allotment sounded quite
mandatory to some.
"All sums authorized shall be allotted."
Explicitly, to make sure that the 'President had
discretion, the Harsha Amendment

changed that.

The word

"All" was deleted from Section 205a so that the Administra­
tor was merely told to allot sums authorized under Section
207 and Section 207, in turn, was amended to read that there
was authorized to be appropriated — and then they added
the itfords, "Not to exceed" $5 and $6 billion for the two
years in question here.
Now, if the intention, as the City of New York
contends, were to place discretion at the obligation stage,
then, as the other Respondent points out, it would be quite
extraordinary for Congress to choose to amend those

10
allotment sections.

They would have amended Section 203,

which Is the obligation — which provides for the obligation
process — to say that you may not

obligate more and you

may obligate less.
So when we are faced with the statute which pro­
vides discretion — provides discretion in the allotment
provision and when those amendments are known to have been
intended to provide that discretion

from the legislative

history, I fail to see how the President or the Administrator
could responsibly have ignored that text, allotted all the
sums and then begun to exercise discretion at the obligation
stage.
If the President had done that, I think the City
of Hew York would have sued us.

I think they might well

have contended that discretion Is lodged at the allotment
stage and once the allotments are made, the rest is
ministerial and that they are entitled to the funds.
And I think they would have had a better argument
than the one that they have now.
QUESTION:

In vetoing the bill originally, was

there a veto message?
HR. BORK:

There was a veto message which related

to the objection to the level of spending, Mr. Justice
Stewart.
QUESTION:

Anything In the veto message bearing on

11
the Issues here?
HR. BORK:

I think not.

He does refer to the fact

that he is worried about federal spending but I think that
was not — the President was worried about federal spending
and the effect on inflation and taxes and so forth.

I do

not recall — I may be corrected if I am wrong — I do not
recall that there is anything that addresses this kind of
technical question.
QUESTION:

Well, I was wondering as to his

discretion, if you can answer that.
MR. BORK:
cretion, yes.

I do not recall it.

As to his dis­

He thought that he didn't have enough in the

veto message and, indeed, overriding the veto, Congress — a
number of Congressmen explicitly said, it is too bad he
thought that because it is plain he does have discretion.
But that goes to the existence and width of the
discretion, rather than the stage at which it must be
exercised and I should say this, that as a practical matter,
the Government has very little interest in which way — at
what stage the discretion must be exercised.
We brought this case up, the City of New York
case, because if we acquiesced in a judgment that there was
no discretion at the allotment stage, we thought we were
quite likely to be whipsawed by another lawsuit in which a
court said, any discretion you had was at the allotment

12
stage.

Mow you must obligate.
And so, although everybody agrees we have dis­

cretion in there some place, we would have lost it.
QUESTION:

I suppose, General Dork, that so long

as there is discussion at 3ome stage, that the ability of
the states to plan will be affected.
MR. BORK:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Whether it is at one or the other.

So

that an argument based entirely on ability to plan runs into
that obstacle.
MR. BORK:

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it seems to

me that there are a variety of arguments in these briefs
which are quite persuasive until you realize that they are
all arguments that Congress should have written a different
statute and that if the statute is applied as written, their
ability to plan or something else will be harmed.
That may be true but I think the ability to plan
is such that the lead time in these things is fairly estensive.

They can plan from the allotments given.
QUESTION:

But it is subject to a lot of error

about the plan.
MR. BORK:

That is correct.

They are not about

to commit themselves, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well,.they aren't about to plan

anything, excpet beyond whatever is allotted to them.

MR. BORK:

That is correct.

On the other hand,

QUESTION:

If they are allotted something, they

due to

may plan knowing perfectly well they are going to have to
submit some plans that will get by.
MR. BORK:

Oh, I think they are now able to begin

to plan In that sense.
QUESTION:

Well, not beyond their allotment.

MR. BORK:

To plan — yes, Mr. Justice White,

maybe we are using the words in a different sense, but the
Administration construes this statute to require that all of
the sums be expended and there is now under discussion a
variety of ways of timing of the release of these funds.
As I understand it, no final decision has been
made so that planning for where would we use these funds
and in what way when they become available could go on now.
Obviously, it would be unwise to enter into
commitments, contractual commitments now for the unallotted
funds.
QUESTION:

What happens if the Congress ultimately

refuses to appropriate?
MR. BORK:

Well, I would hesitate to give a firm

answer to that, Mr. Justice Blackmun, because we might have
a suit in the Court of Claims which we might have to defend.
I don’t envision Congress having encouraged states

14
by saying we will appropriate at some future date a total of
$18 billion and the sums have been allotted and plans are
put in and the states make the expenditures.

I really

can't contemplate that Congress at that stage would say, we
were quite mistaken.

We don't intend to appropriate the

funds.
QUESTION:

Yet it is not an uncommon phenomenon,

is it, for Congress to authorize substantially more money
for a given project than is ultimately appropriated?
MR. BORK:

Well, that may be, Mr. Justice Rehnquist;

but I think here it may authorize it but if states have gone
forward and expended their own funds and got themselves into
commitments which are legally binding,

I would think It

would be extraordinary if Congress then backed down on Its
promise and, furthermore, there might be at that stage, I
think, litigation about the obligation of the United States.
QUESTION:

Well, you said a moment ago that this

was a unique or a — well, a unique way of going about
appropriating or making funds available, different- from the
ordinary budgetary process.
MR. BORK:

As I understand it, yes,

QUESTION:

What is that difference, do you think?

MR. BORK:

In part. It is this process of author­

izing for appropriation.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that pretty usual to

15
authorize in advance?

As Mr. Justice Rehnquist says, more

than they may eventually appropriate?
MR. BORK:

I don’t think it is usual to have a

process in which you authorise for appropriation and then
go through the allotment stage and the obligation stage and
then appropriate it.
QUESTION:

I may be quite wrong about that.
It is the allotment stage that is

unique here in the budgetary process, isn’t it, rather than
the authorization of the appropriation?
MR. BORK:

Well, I had this — the authorization

for appropriation and its purpose explained to me and I was
told that it Is quite unique in this kind of statute.
can, perhaps, shed further light upon that later.
now.

I

I can't

One of the reasons is, usually, when you have to go to

a project, you go through the Appropriations Committee.

At

this stage, Congress, in effect, authorizes the appropriation
without going through the Appropriations Committee, which
does, considerably, limit the Appropriations Committee's
discretion at a later date.
I think that is what is unique about it.
QUESTION:

You think that is unique?

MR. BORK:

I think it is, Mr. Justice *— Mr. Chief

QUESTION:

So that it takes it outside of what has

Justice.

been a common

rubric in the Appropriations Committee that

16
Congress proposes but we, the Appropriations Committee,
dispose.
MR. BORK:

Well, I think this does tend.

I donft

think this is, if I may say so, central to the issue we have
befor’e us, but I think this does, to some degree, limit the
Appropriation Committee’s influence on the size of the
appropriations but I think that, in effect, does not — it
may account for some of the confusion in this entire process,
but it does not go to the question, I think, which is before
us, which is the President's discretion and how broad it is.
As I say, that is —
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, initially, I

think, did not the Government take the position that this
commitment of $18 billion — perhaps that is not the right
word, but this $18 billion did not necessarily have to be
spent but now I gather the position of the Government is
that it must be spent under this legislation.
MR. BORK:

That is the —

QUESTION:

But the discretion is such that it may

be spent over a period of time.
MR. BORK:

The amount we now believe is firm.

It

may be stretched out in the expenditure.
QUESTION:

Well, to that extent, when you say It

must be spent — to that extent, that is to say it has been
appropri ated.

17
MR. BORK:

Oh. no, no, I mean, we think the

Executive, under the statute, has an obligation to allot the
$18 billion

ultimately, but the Executive, we think, was

given discretion to control the timing.
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand you to say that, but

to the extent that the $18 billion must be spent, Congress
has indicated that it is going to be there.
MR. BORK:

Congress has certainly indicated that.

QUESTION:

But yet you think that something else

may be necessary in the nature of Congressional appropria­
tions, in fact, to make the $18 billion?
MR. BORK:

I think so, but I think they have to

pass an appropriations bill.

They simply have — the statute

itself provides that we will appropriate the money at a
later date so that under this scheme, they must do that.
QUESTION:

But you now say that whatever dis­

cretion the Executive got, it doesn't extend to deciding
that $X million or $X billion will not be spent at any time.
MR. BORK:

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.

The discretion is timing.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

Rate of spending.

QUESTION:

The fact that the Executive doesn’t

have that rate of spending doesn’t necessarily mean that
Congress will ultimately appropriate all of the money that

18
is now authorized.
MR. BORK:
Rehnquist.

That is quite true* Mr. Justice

I said to that only, one* that I would find it

extraordinary if Congress got states into this position and
then let them down and I would think that there might well
be litigation in the Court of Claims over it.
Litigation as to which I ought not now to take a
position.
QUESTION:

Ordinarily* the mere fact of an

authorization doesn't give any assurance to anyone that
necessarily would be an appropriation.
MR. BORK:

That is correct, sir.

QUESTION:

Here there is something more.

It may

not be complete assurance of appropriation but I gather you
are saying that they can’t let the states down — almost,
they’ll have to.
MR. BORK:

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION:

The Congress certainly will have to.

Or it has indicated that definitely it will.
MR. BORK:

They have certainly indicated that and

I take it that is a moral commitment at the very least.
QUESTION:

To that extent, this is a little

different than the ordinary —
MR. BORK:
QUESTION:

Yes.
case, is it?

19
MR. BORK:

I believe so, Mr. Justice Brennan.

QUESTION:

The mechanism would be that if the

House Appropriations Committee declined to appropriate and
the Senate Appropriations Committee also, you are suggesting
the House and the Senate could override and reject.
MR. BORK:

Oh, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And that would take care of it.

MR. BORK:

I think so, but I think the main

effect of this process Is that a moral commitment is made
which the Appropriations Committee, I think, would be bound
to respect.
But I 'wanted to discuss the scope of this
discretion because I think it Is enough of a case, rather
than the stage at which it occurred and Campaign Clean
Mater tells us that we really shouldn't pay too much atten­
tion to the Harsha Amendment, which I have described, which
were supposed to give discretion to the President, the
Amendments to Section 205-a and 207 because, he says, thev
are a considerable monkey-wrench thrown into the statute in
order to achieve a political compromise with the President
and, of course, ultimately, they were used to achieve
the gathering of votes to override the President's veto.
And it is important to remember at this stage,
v/hen you address a question of what the discretion is, what
the fight was about, there was no fight about the President’s

discretion not to squander money if lie found it could not be
spent advantageously on sewage treatment facilities.
lie has the nower to refuse to spend monev in a
vrasteful fashion under the Antideficiencv Act already.

There

was no reason to put that kind of discretion into this
statute.
What the fight was about, what the veto message
was about and what the fight in Congress was about, was the
President’s authority to withhold spending, withhold
obligation or ’withhold allotment, whichever stage you nut it
at, for fiscal policy reasons as well as nropram reasons.
QUESTION:

Is the veto messape somewhere in these?

HR. CORK:

It is in the Joint Appendix,

Hr. Justice Stewart, in this brown book.

I am sure.

QUESTION:

Sorry to bother you.

HR. BORK:

— oh, I trust

And it is —

- it is in the record,

Maybe I can make a check —
QUESTION:

Maybe one of your colleapues can do it

without takinp un your time.
HR. BORK:

The — and. I would ooint out that when

Conpress -- before the veto, when Congress vras explaining
these amendments, Ilarsha Amendments, when they were talking
about them, before tine veto representative of Ilarsha on
page 18 of our brief •— I will not quote all the .language on
page 18 of our brief — he was quite clear that the

21
language said that the President can snend anything up to
the sum but not to exceed the sum of $5 and $6 billion for
those two years and Senator Cooper, who was a Senate
conferee on page 19 of our brief, specifically said that the
President had the responsibility for evaluating the program
needs in relation to other national priorities, which
certainly means the President had the power to make a trade­
off between the variety of priorities.
After the veto, Senator Ilarsha — Representative
Harsha came back again and he, in urging the House to over­
ride the veto, he said, we have emphasized over and over
again that if federal spending must be curtailed and if such
spending cuts must affect water pollution control author­
izations, the administration can impound the money.
That is on page 20 of our brief.
And on page 21, vre quote Representative Clausen,
another conferee, who says repeatedly that if the President
must hold the reins on the federal budget, these amendments,
this discretion, gives him the poi^er to hold the reins on
the federal budget and the statutory language itself, of
course, contains no restriction upon the discretion
authorized'.
How, Congress could have written a different
statute.

It can still write a different statute.

But this

is the one we have and I think it would be quite wrong — it

22
is quite wrong, I think, for the Respondents to ask that
that discretion, which is clearly in the legislative history,
which is clearly in the statute itself, should be excised by
courts on the theory that they want to forward the goal of
clean water,
That is — if that process is to be speeded up,
that is a process that can be worked out between the
President and the Congress,
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t there — I guess they can

speak for themselves, but I thought they disagreed on — as
to when.
MR. BORK:

The stage of the process at which —

QUESTION:

The other -

MR. 30RK:

— the discretion occurs.

QUESTION:

Your opponents don’t say the discretion

should be excised completely, do they?
MR. BORK:

Well, they want to cut it down to —

it’s very odd, Mr. Justice White, to see, for example, the
scope of judicial review of the discretion that is suggested
by the Campaign Clean Water brief.

One is told really only

that the discretion may not be authorized, may not be
exercised in a way that would in any way jeopardize the
goals of the program and the deadlines of the program.
Well, that is to say that there is almost no
discretion and it is to say that these Congressmen who said

23
that if the federal budget and the demands of fiscal policy
ran counter to the expenditure of all these funds, then the
President had the authority to protect the federal spending
levels by cutting back on the water program.
QUESTION:

Do you say that as you presently view

the Act in terms of whether the $18 billion must be allotted
at some time, do you say that there really is not much
difference between you and the City of New York?
MR. BORK:

No, I think the City of New York thinks

that, except for program-related reasons, not federal fiscal
policy reasons, that the money must be obligated.
The discretion occurs at the obligation stage,
but I think they have a quite narrow view of what the
discretion is.
QUESTION:

So there are major differences, major

gulfs between you and —
MR. BORK:

The major gulf between Government and

both of these Respondents Is the scope of the discretion and
I think that is the nub of the case.,
QUESTION:

Not the time,

MR. BORK:

Not the time,

QUESTION:

The scope.

MR. BORK:

The scope.

I think the statute is

clear on the time but as a practical matter,' the scope is
what counts and I think the scope is quite clear from the

24
from the way these amendments were used to override a
Presidential veto on fiscal considerations and it was
explicitly said that these amendments give him control if
he thinks the spending is too high, the total spending, not
the spending related to this particular program.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, on page 9 of

your brief, as I understand it, down at the bottom, page 9,
you say, in effect, that there is no practical difference
between exercising control over the rate of spending at the
two stages.
If I understand that and if that is correct, what
is the difference between the parties here today?
HR. BORK:

Well, I think — as I mentioned,

Mr. Justice Powell, we felt that the statute clearly places
it at the allotment stage and if we didn’t come up to this
Court with that, that we could get whipsawed by a later
Court saying, you have already allotted and now your
discretion is gone.
QUESTION:

So, in effect, you are protecting a

future position, the ultimate effect, I judge, in your
opinion, unless you were outflanked in this way, will be
the same.
MR. BORK:

If this

if I understand the issue,

Mr. Justice Powell, if this Court, for example, were to
write an opinion saying that the discretion operates

25
contrary to our submission at the obligation stage rather
than the allotment stage, it would make almost no difference
but the question of what that discretion is and whether it
is reviewable by a court putting itself in the position of
the President and looking at the program, the size of the
budget at the time, the other competing national priorities
at stake and making a balance and saying, no, a reasonable
President would have spent more, that is the nub of
case.

That is what we think is a political question.
Congress gave this discretion.

The President has

exercised it . 'd we think it violates the political question
doctrine.
QUESTION:

If the only issue that we thought was

presented was just a timing question, if the discussion —
MR. BORK:
White,

It is not the only issue, Mr. Justice

In Campaign Clean Water, the Fourth Circuit repealed,

reversed and remanded for a trial de novo of the
dent’s extent of discretion.
QUESTION:

I understand.

Presi­

<

But If the only issue

were a timing, there wouldn’t be much to argue about.

You

wouldn’t really care much.
MR. BORK:

Well, I wouldn’t care much If

this

Court told me which stage It was at, Mr. Justice White, but
if a lower court did, then I would be in a position of
perhaps getting caught by a court in a different jurisdiction

26

disagreeing.
QUESTION:

But the important thing here is,

whether we say allotment or obligation, your real concern Is
the breadth of discretion of the President.
MR. BORK:

That is, I think, the real nub of this

case and I think that the statute itself, on its face, gives
an unconfined discretion and the variety of congressional
expressions.
QUESTION:
Mr. Bork.

I see that your light is running out,

Are you going to say anything about this?

haven't had a chance to read it.

I

It only arrived this

morning.
MR. BORK:

I will say only about that, Mr. Justice

Brennan, that that brief proves, in our opinion, mathe­
matically, that the new Act does not affect this case.
QUESTION:

I see.

All right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, in view of

the wa.y the timing is working out here today, we'll extend
for your side of the table, six minutes and give the
Solicitor General six minutes more.
approximately right at 3=00 o'clock.

That will finish us up

self accordingly, Mr. Thompson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOHN R. THOMPSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP NEW YORK CITY
MR. THOMPSON:

Thank you very much, sir.

27
While these are two —
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
These are two very separate cases.

Because they

were consolidated by the Court on the grant of certiorari,
we have agreed with the Respondent in the other case, the
Campaign Clean Water case, to divide our time.
I will attempt to stay within the 15 minutes
which I had originally planned on for the City of New York.
As we see it, the issue in this case, in the
New York City case, is very different — is very definitely
the timing at which any kind of executive controls over the
rate of spending is to be exercised, not the scope of that
discretion.
We believe that the legislative history shows
clearly and unmistakeably that the

Harsha Amendments and

whatever control they gave the Executive over the rate of
spending was not to be operative at the allotment stage.
Thus, full allotments were required to be made
by Congress after the Harsha Amendments, as they were before
the Harsha Amendments.

VJhatever discretion was conferred

by the Harsha Amendments or confirmed by the Harsha Amend­
ments over the rate of spending was to be operative, as the
Court of Appeals found — decided — only at the obliga­
ti onal stage.
Now, in point 1 of our brief, at pages 8 to 17,

28
we have summarized that part of the legislative history
which goes to the time at which whatever the discretion is,
the time at which it should be exercised and we believe that
it is far clearer than the Solicitor General would have you
believe.
Let me back up just a minute.

The legislative

history of the Harsha Amendment shows two strands, if you
will, two interwoven strands.
One does show, as the Government maintains, that
the objective, the overall objective of those Harsha
Amendments, was, in the words of several of the legislation
sponsors, to emphasize the flexibility of the President’s
control over the rate of spending.
We do not — we have no difference with the
Government.

That was the overall objective.

Where we

differ with the Government is as to when that control,
whatever its scope, was to be exercised.
In its brief, the Government had virtually
ignored the legislative history going to the second strand,
as to when it should be exercised, but included in our -- in
the materials in point one of our brief, are statements by
sponsors of the Act in both Houses, both before and after
the veto message, which we believe clearly show that the
Court of Appeals was correct in deciding that Congress
intended that discretion be exercised only at the

29

obligational stage.
QUESTION:

Mr. Thompson, are you going to suggest

what the practical difference is, the timing —
MR. THOMPSON:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, and that

xtfas raised by questions from your Honor and from Justices
Black and Blackmun — White and Blackmun.
The function — the function of allotment,
essentially, in this so-called ''contract authority funding,"
the main function of allotment is to give the states and
their political subdivisions a justification for going ahead
with the very intricate planning for all of the vast
construction which Congress intended to induce the states to
perform in order to clean up the waters of the country in a
very short period of time.
Now, there is a statement which is quoted almost
in full at page 23 of our brief by Representative Harsha
on that planning process.

It indicates several things.

First of all, how Important the planning process
was to those who conceived and labored and drafted this
statute.
Secondly, it showed that they were interested, not
in bits and pieces, stop and go planning, as various amounts
of money might be allotted and allotted and allotted under
the Government's theory.

They had in mind, and Mr. Harsha

emphasized, coordinated, long-range planning so that any

30
locality that was a beneficiary of Title II xvculd be able to
plan whatever Its share was of $18 billion worth of projects.
QUESTION:

In other words, you know in advance

that you are going to get $350 million?
MR. THOMPSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That puts you in a position where you

can plan around a possibility of $350 million.
MR. THOMPSON:

Not only a position, your Honor,

where you can plan, but you may even not be able to plan
as a local official —
QUESTION:

Unless.

MR. THOMPSON:

— unless you have some kind of

ticket from the Government, some kind of go-ahead, something
you can point to, to the rest of your bureaucracy, to your
city council, your aldermen, whatever it happens to be, and
to your constituents, who are also affected by this, to
the people.
That same statement on page 23 of the brief, In
that same statement, Mr. Harsha mentions the kind of things
that are Included in the planning process and there are a
lot more than just simply drawing up engineering and
architectural plans and specifications.

As long as that

takes, and difficult as that is, he mentions planning
generally, by which I take it he meant community planning,
deciding where these various plants — and collection

31
systems, I might add, where they will be located, how they
will be fitted in with other capital projects of that
municipality.
He mentions site acquisition.

He mentions

feasibility studies and he mentions getting authorization
for any necessary bonds that had to be sold under this
statute; while the Federal Government is putting up a great
deal of money, the states and localities have to put up one
quarter, which comes to $6 billion and it is not easy these
days, or any day, perhaps, for states and localities to
raise their proportionate share of that.
That has to be coordinated with their other needs.
It is a vast undertaking to make a coordinated plan in the
broadest sense of the word to — for projects that would
be able to qualify for the then-federal grants and It seems
to us that if one remembers the function, the main function
of allotment to lay a basis for the cities and towns to go
ahead and engage in that planning process, then it becomes
clear that, absent any specific Congressional intent other­
wise, that the only discretion conveyed, conferred or
emphasized in the Harsha Amendments applied not to
allotment if full allotments had to be made, it applied at
the obligation stage and In the course of our point one, we
point to a statement by Mr. Harsha in which he said, he
talked about the obligation stage, that is at which after

32

the full planning of a project has taken place and it is
reviewed by the Administrators reviextfed, certainly, for
compliance with the conditions in the statute and, perhaps,
we would — for New York we would concede this, perhaps, alSQ
for some fiscal considerations.
At that point is when the Administrator, by
approval, would either subject the United States to an
obligation to pay that grant or, by holding

it up, by non­

approval, he would not subject the United States to that
obligation.
It is at that point, after all of the planning,
that we believe, under appropriate circumstances, the
Executive could impose what might be

called the ’'hold"

on either a certain type of projects or otherwise.

That

would be the point right before the United States became
obligated but, at any rate, at that point, when the United
States wanted to exercise the flexibility the Act talks
about, when the fiscal stringency had vanished, if you will,
the plans would all have been made.
You would have a shelf-full of plans and the tap,
so to speak, could be turned on.
That, we think, is much more consistent vfith the
underlying intent of Congress that this was a massive,
ambitious program and they wanted it done just as fast as
it could possibly be done.

33
The allotments, you will notice, were said to be —
the allotments were to be made no later than particular
dates.

The first date was no later than 30 days after

enactment of the Act.
The second allotment for the next fiscal year
came along six weeks thereafter and the final allotment was
to be six months before the fiscal year for which it was
being made.
Almost at the earliest possible stage Congress
wanted these allotments made.
QUESTION:

Mr. Thompson, do you think that the

Administrator, under your theory, his discretion is con­
fined to the obligation stage.

Do you think he has the

same order of discretion or degree of discretion at that
stage, that the Solicitor General contends he has at the
allocation stage?
MR. THOMPSON:

I have never heard the — until

today seen any indication from the Government as to exactly
how broad they thought the discretion was.

I — that has

been, in our view of this case, of our case, that is an
iffy question which is not before the Court, how much — how
wide the discretion is.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, It is a difficult question
left open by the fact that, in my view, at any rate, the
statute does not clearly delineate that.

It looks to me,

34
from references that Representative Harsha made, to the
procedure the Executive was then following under the Federal
Highway Act, which was later held to be improper by the
Eighth Circuit, but the references that Representative
Harsha made to that, it seems to me in all honesty, that
some discretion would lodge at the obligation stage in the
Executive beyond just the criteria which are in the Act,
which are environmental, engineering and financial.
But, as I say, that is an iffy question because
it is — and it might — it might have to be settled in
future litigation, although I think that has become much
less likely since this new Budget Act of 1974, itfhich now
provides for quite a clear way in which Congress and the
President can work cooperatively.
If this Court should declare, should affirm and
thereby declare that the full allotments have to be made,
and then, perhaps, adding that the Harsha Amendments
conferred some discretion at the obligation stage, then the
President would presumably make the allotments.

Then at a

later stage, if it should be desirable for the — if the
President and his

Administrator should think it desirable

to put a hold on the obligation of funds, that action would
be subject to the new Budget Act.

The President would have

to submit a special message to Congress.

He would propose

that deferral and the deferral would be effective for the

35
rest of that fiscal year, unless either House of Congress
adopted a resolution rejecting, disapproving of the deferral.
It provides a mechanism which we have not had
before for cooperative effort between the —
QUESTION:

Do you think there is any difference

between you and the Solicitor General, other than the
claiming of this discretion?
Do you think there is some difference between you
and him with respect to the scope?

Or have you even

reached that?
MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Justice White, we have not been

discussing — we have not been thinking ourselves, except
academically, and we have not been arguing with the
Government in our case over the scope of the discretion.
Our argument has always been, the Government has
said they had complete discretion, complete and unreviewable
discretion —
QUESTION:

Well, you seem to concede there is some

discretion sometime.
MR. THOMPSON:

And now they also, they have

changed their position since the early days of this
litigation to say that the full amount of the $18 billion
must be allotted sometime.
In the lower courts they took the position that
the Harsha Amendments said they didn’t have to allot them

36
If the President

didn’t x^ant to anytime.

Now they say

they have to be allotted, they just don't say exactly when
they will do it.
QUESTION:

I am not sure this is fair as a question

but do you concede that, at the commitment stage —
MR. THOMPSON:
QUESTION:

The obligation stage?

The obligation stage, yes.

The

obligation stage there is discretion to refuse to obligate
because the Executive does not want to spend money that fast?
MR. THOMPSON:

I don't believe that is an unfair

question but as I replied to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would
be — that would be a gratuitous answer that I would give you
I think it would depend upon the circumstances and whether
the President could really make out a case that fiscal needs
did actually require it.
QUESTION:

Does that not concede discretion?

MR. THOMPSON:

It certainly — excuse me — we

would concede that there was a measure of discretion.

We

don't know how broad that would be and I think it would be
fair — I certainly wouldn't be in a position to say that it
was just if the President decided overnight for some whim
that suddenly all spending should stop here.
QUESTION:

But, to take a more extreme example, if

suddenly we got into some peripheral war, that might have a
lot to do with It.

37
MR. THOMPSON:

I think under the statute that

certainly would authorise it and then, as I indicated, under
the Budget Act, anyway, it would be subject, if he were
getting way off base, to, in effect, to correction by
Congress.
QUESTION:

By resolution.

MR. THOMPSON:
QUESTION:

By resolution,yes, sir.

Mr. Thompson, perhaps you addressed

yourself to this but if so, I missed it.
Do you agree with the basic thrust of this most
recent brief filed by the Solicitor General as to the non­
applicability of the new legislation?
MR. THOMPSON:

We have not been favored with a

copy of it, your Honor.
QUESTION:

We only were favored with it last night.

MR. THOMPSON:

But from what the Solicitor

General said, we would agree with it with one caveat,
that this proposed deferral of allotment has been included
in the special message that the President sent to

Congress.

He included it for information only, saying it
ivas not really within Congress ’ purview under the new Act,
but said he would like further guidance.
Now, if — he also said that he would abide the
decision of this Court on the legal points involved here
but if the — either House of Congress, taking advantage of

38
the President’s submission in that form should pass a
resolution disapproving of the further deferral of allotments
of the unallotted $9 billion, then it would seem to me
reasonable to suppose that the Solicitor General would
promptly advise this Court and then give the Government’s
view as to whether they then agreed that they would comply
with what Congress was
do and at

either asking or ordering them to

that point, if it came before your decision in

this case — when and if, I say — conceivably that could
alter — it could alter the situation.
Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

Mr. Jacks, you will have about 18, 18 and a half
minutes now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. THOMAS JACKS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF CAMPAIGN CLEAN WATER
MR. JACKS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
I’d like to start my argument on an agreeable
note.

I’ll begin agreeing with General Bork when he said

that he thinks the scope of the discretion is at the nub of
this case.

I agree.
My client, Campaign Clean Water, is in some

respects, I suppose, at the middle of the road in this
case.

We are flanked on the one hand vxith the City of New

39
York, which takes the position that the Administrator-has
absolutely no discretion to withhold funding at the allot­
ment stage.
On the other hand, we are flanked by the
Administrator of EPA, who claims that he has unbounded
discretion to withhold allotments, as General Bork pointed
out in turning to the language of Representative Harsha on
the floor, that they can allot anything up to the $18 billion
at least initially.
We take what I think is a more reasonable view
of the statute than either of these.

That is that, yes,

there is some discretion intended at the allotment stage,
but that discretion is limited and we think was abused in
the situation.
I’d like to address myself —
QUESTION:

Do you think the discretion is only at

the allotment stage?
MR, JACKS:
QUESTION:
MR. JACKS:
QUESTION:
MR. JACKS:

Yes, sir, we do.

We do.

It isn't an either/or proposition?
No, sir.
As posed, isn’t it, or —
Well, we think, our reading of the

statute and legislative history — we think it is pretty
clear that the discretion was intended to be exercised at
the allotment stage because it was the section on allotments

40

and not the section on obligations that was amended.
QUESTION:
MR. JACKS:

That was amended.
They could have just as easily

changed the mandatory language in Section 203 on obligations
to be discretionary, if they had wanted to let the Adminis­
trator exercise his discretion there.
QUESTION:

So you would not think that the — once

the Executive allots, he cannot later, at the obligation
stage, say we are spending money too fast?
MR. JACKS:

I believe that is correct, Mr. Justice

White.
I’d like to focus primarily on the question this
afternoon of how do we know that the Administrator's
discretion was intended to be limited and how do we gauge
where those limitations lie?
I think perhaps the principal point of departure
between Campaign Clean Water and the Administrator is over
what interpretive tools the Court relies on in determining
whether there is discretion, whether there are limitations
on the discretion and where t2ie limitations lie.
The Solicitor General, in his argument, pointed
primarily to the floor language, to the remarks of
Representative Harsha and said, "It is clear from this that
Congress intended to give discretion notwithstanding the
remainder of the statute."

41
The Solicitor General would have this Court look
more to what was done in the 11th hour In this statute and
accuses us of ignoring this floor language.
I suppose we would accuse the Administrator of
ignoring the entire remainder of the statute.
I think it is useful, in answering the question,
"Hoxv" do you know what the limitations are?1' to do two things.
First, to take a general overview1 of what 'went on
here, of what went on in the Congress over this two-year
period during which the statute was pending.
I think it is useful, secondly, to look at some of
the specific provisions of the statute and just ask what
do these provisions mean?

Are they still effective.if

the Administrator’s view is upheld that

his discretion is

virtually unbounded.
First the overview.

This statute,, as we pointed

*»

out in our brief, was two years in the making.

It x-ms very

carefully constructed.
From the beginning, the proponents' of this statute
sought to eliminate completely the discharges of pollution
into our nation’s waters and to do so in accordance with a
prescribed

timetable.

They x^ere fought every step of the

way by the Executive branch, by the Administration.

The

Administration opposed the level of funding.
The Administration opposed the contract authority

mechanism of funding.
rigid deadlines.

The Administration opposed having

It opposed having mandatory enforcement

provisions.
Despite this opposition, the Bill was submitted to
the Congress, was passed.

The President, as was his

constitutional prerogative, vetoed it and he listed as his
chief reason the level of spending called for.
He would have suggested a lower level of spending.
The bill was returned to the Congress and the veto
was overridden and was overridden overwhelmingly in both
Houses and during the course of the debates on the veto
override, people on both sides of the aisle — the Democrat,
Senator Muskie, the Republican representative Harsha, all
agreed that Congress tvas dictating that the job be done, that
they knew it was expensive, they knew it would tax the
nation’s resources to some extent, but that Congress had
made that decision.
The question I think we have got to ask in taking
this overview is, is it reasonable to assume that in making
this last minute change, to achieve what was essentially a
political compromise in its attempt to avoid a veto.
Is it reasonable to assume that, in making that
change, the Congress intended to eviscerate the remainder
of the statute?
not.

I think the answer has got to be clearly

And yet I think if you turn to some of the specific

43
provisions of the statute, you will find that that would,
indeed., be the effect.

QUESTION:

Doesn’t the Solicitor General’s

representation, the Government’s policy or position with
respect to the commitment of the entire $18 billion at least
cut some of the foundation away from that argument?
MR. JACKS:

It doesn’t give me much satisfaction,

Mr. Chief Justice, because, under the statute-, there was a
time frame intended as well as

an intent as to the job to

be done.
In other words, Congress intended not only that
the nation’s waters be cleaned up, but that they be cleaned
up in accordance with the prescribed schedule.

So it does

not give me much comfort when the Solicitor General tells us,
don’t worry, we are going to release the entire $18 billion.
We are just not going to tell you \vhen we are going to do it.
That doesn’t give me much comfort when I look at
Title III of the statute and I see that under Title III,
there are two deadlines.

One Is that by 1977, municipalities

must achieve a secondary level treatment.
The other is that by 1983 they must achieve ■--their plants must feature the best practical technology.
That gives me problems.
QUESTION:

Doesn’t the power of Congress to dea.1

with this by resolution at any time give any comfort to

44
you?
MR. JACKS:

No, sir, it does not. because I agree

with the Solicitor General that, the new Budget Control Act,
which became effective on July 12 of 1974, doesn't apply —
at least not right now — to the impoundment actions which
are at issue in this case.
I think that his construction of that statute is
correct when he says that the triggering action by the
Executive must be one which was commenced after July 12 ,
1974.
I don't think the Congress can do anything, really,
about this.

At least, not right novr.

Now, at some point in

the future, he may — the Administrator may take some
further action which would trigger the provisions of that
statute.

But —
QUESTION:
MR. JACKS:
QUESTION:

Mr. Jacks.

I have —
I beg your pardon, sir.
I have some difficulty with that,

You say Congress can't do anything about it now.
Now, as a practical matter, it might be very-

clumsy, very slow, very burdensome, but Congress can do
anything it wants to on this, the day after tomorrow,
couldn't they?
MR. JACKS:

Well, clearly, xtfhen we are dealing

with the Congress, they can do pretty nearly anything they

45
want to within the limitations of the Constitution and at
any time they -want to.

I don't think that we, as litigants,

should be forced to rely on the hope that at some time in
the future, Congress is going to bail us out when Congress
has already said, I think, pretty clearly, what it intends
to be done.
That would be our position, really, on that
statute.
I think, not only — let me look — let rue spend
one more minute on this question of deadlines.

We cited in

our brief to a survey that was done by EPA last year for
their 1973 needs survey which was prepared pursuant to the
statute that is at issue in this case.
In that survey, EPA concluded that — and I'll
speak here of the State of Virginia since that is the state
I know best.

That is where my group came from.

They said

Virginia is going to need $650 million, roughly, just to
meet the 1977 deadlines — just to meet that secondary
treatment deadline in 1977.
Nox?, 75 percent of that, of course, should come
from the Federal Government under this legislation.
would be about $489 million.

That

If Virginia had gotten all

the sums that were authorized for fiscal '73, '74 and '75,
it would have had slightly more than enough — there would
have been slightly more than enough federal money to enable

Virginia to meet that '77 deadline.
As it is9 with the withholding of 55 percent of
the funding for the first two fiscal years, Virginia has
gotten $243 million rather than the $489 million in federal
money they need just to meet that deadline.
In other words, even if you take EPA's own
estimates of what construction needs are to comply with the
statute, it is clear we are in trouble.
I think another specific provision of this statute
that is instructive and one that has been addressed already
to some extent this afternoon is the contract authority
provision of Title II of the Act.
Those provisions are

relevant because when you

study the legislative history, it is clear that Congress
intended, in enacting this advance funding mechanism, to
give municipalities and states the opportunity to plan
ahead so that they would know, in looking several years
down the road, what federal money they could expect and
could plan accordingly.
Now, when the Administrator construes his
authority under the Act to mean that he can make an initial
allotment in whatever amount he pleases and then can dole
out further allotments from time to time, from year to year
as he sees fit, I think it is clear that that entirely
frustrates that very-carefully-contrived legislative scheme.

47
I think, then, that when one studies the entire
legislative history of this statute, when one looks at the
deadlines provisions, when one looks at the contract
authority provisions, it becomes clear that Congress must
have intended some limitation on the discretion the
Administrator was being given leave to exercise.
In other words, I think that these are far more
useful tools than merely turning to Representative Harsha
and seeing that he said we can do anything up to that amount.
I think it is far more useful and it is indeed in
accordance with general rules of statutory Construction for
this Court to look at the entirety of the statute and ask
the question, does it make sense that Congress intended to
give the Administrator unfettered discretion in light of
what that would do to the remainder of the statute.
If the Court has no further questions, I believe
I have concluded.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Jacks.

Mr. Solicitor General, you have a few minutes
left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
ROBERT H. BORK, SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. BORK:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

48
Let me — allow me, please, to explain the
supplemental brief and its problems.

I was informed that

the City of New York had been served with page proof last
Thursday and I hope it had been.
The only purpose of that supplemental brief was
to quiet any concern that this case might have become moot
by the new statute.

This brief is really not in discussion

here because it is quite clear whatever view one takes of
the new statute, these deferrals would not become moot unless
Congress took some further action, which it has not taken.
On the question of discretion, which I think is the
main question we all agreed we have before us, I wish to
point — I did point out — that if the discretion is as
broad as the Congressmen repeatedly said it was in getting
the votes to override the veto, then it would be impossible
for a judge to place

himself in the position of a President

balancing the budget or trying to control inflation and make
the choices.
But I think it is worth saying something el3e.
I think —
QUESTION:

Your point is that it is unreviewable,

judicially unreviewable discretion.
MR. BORK;

Mr. Justice Stewart, if Congress said

to the President, spend this money unless you think
inflation is getting out of hand or other priorities are

49
more Important, but we’d like you to spend this money unless
you find something like that.
It seems to me at that point you have a political
judgment in the classical sense by the President and for a
court to try to apply Its standards to how that judgment
should have been made would be a classic violation of the
political question doctrine.
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes.

MR. BORK:

Yes.

QUESTION:

It is judicially unrevlewable.

MR. BORK:

At that stage.

But I want to point

out that Campaign Clean Water attempts to give us a narrower
form of review which is a form of review about can the
program go forward effectively with this kind of withholding
of funds?
I would point out to you that that form of review
is also — has a spurious attractiveness — what the
President has authority to do is to make a cost/benefit
analysis under the Antideficiency Act or inherently of
■•

■

whether spending more funds this year rather than next
would merely inflate the cost of the r'esources and whether
it is worth it and that, too, Is a kind of discretion that
I think it would be quite difficult for a court to review
because It's a cost/benefit analysis and the President is
saying, is 20 percent more dollars worth 10 percent more

50

output or not?
So I think that is an executive kind of decision
which would be exceedingly difficult to review.

But in any

case, the deadlines in the Act, it is now quite clear,
probably cannot be met even if all this money were spent.
The Administrator has reported to Congress that,
far from $18 billion, the Act’s objectives are going to
require $340 to $350 billion.
So I think we are not realistically —
QUESTION:

Do you?

MR. BORK:

As I. am informed, that the Administrator

of OMB has reported to Congress that the total needs for
water purification in this country are going to amount to
well over $300 billion.
So that I think we are not — and I think there is
going to be trouble with these deadlines, no matter what
happens and the appropriate thing for these states to do is
to apply for rule-making procedures because the Administrator
controls the standards which must be met by the deadlines
and if they cannot meet those standards, then there is a
mechanism in the Act by which that can be accommodated.
One thing that can’t be changed is that this Act
was sold to Congress and the President’s veto overridden on
a view of discretion which included discretion to control
total spending and not just discretion with relation to the

51
effectiveness cf this program.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the legislative

history at this time, Mr. Solicitor Generals which suggests
that this astronomical figure that you now mention was in
contemplation when they got their foot in the door with the
$18 billion?
MR. BORK:

No, I think, Mr. Chief Justice that the

problem was vastly underestimated when —
QUESTION:

Nobody really knows.

Is that it?

MR. BORK:

Nobody knew at that time.

I — one

hopes that the later estimates become progressively more
accurate; except for the amounts involved, one would hope
that.

But the sums, apparently, are much larger than were

anticipated and I think those deadlines of the statute would
not be met if this money were' paid out.
QUESTION:

I gather, Mr. Solicitor, that if we

were to agree with you, you would still feel, whether the
choice was at the allotment stage or at the obligation
stage, that there ought to be reversals in both these eases
or the remands for dismissal of both complaints?
MR. BORK:

That is precisely what I think should

happen, Mr. Justice —
QUESTION:

The latter on the ground that this is

a nonreviewable discretion and therefore, the critical
question in that sense

52
MR. BORK:

It could be put either in the form of

nonrevlevtfable or in the form of Congress Intended it to be
this broad and therefore, there is no function —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

— to be served.

And I think the

latter is the case, although I think it is also nonre viewable.
QUESTION:

It could be very, very broad and still

be reviewable or it could be relatively narrow, as you
pointed out and still be nonreviewable.
MR. BORK:

That is quite true.

I suugest that I

think it was given in such a broad fashion that, reviewable
or not, there is really nothing wrong has happened here.
But, secondly, I think If one began to review It,
that one would immediately be into an area where there are
no standards for courts to apply and the courts would
essentially be making a judgment that is reserved for an
executive In oui* form of government.
QUESTION:

Well, an executive, especially,

presumably, especially informed in the field.
MR. BORK:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, an

executive with a delegated authority in this case.
QUESTION:

And with standards?

MR. BORK:

The only standards that are apparent

in the legislative history — there are none apparent

53
on the face of the statute.

It is an unbounded discretion.

The only standards which are apparent In the
legislative history are, to control federal spending because
of inflationary pressures.
QUESTION:

Well, that would not preclude an

administrator from suis ponte

promulgating regulations or

inviting rule-making, as you intimated, would it?
MR. BORK:

No, that would not prevent the

Administrator from inviting rule-making.
QUESTION:

And if it is $300 or $350 billion,

that might well be indicated.
MR. BORK:
Justice.

I was suggesting as much, Mr. Chief

I think that if those figures are accurate, then

the expenditure of sums from this case. Is going to have
very little to do in general with the meeting of deadlines.
And the standards may have to be changed or Congress may
have to be approached.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General —
QUESTION:

May I just go back one second?

Your position is that the discretion must be
exercised at the obligation stage.
MR, BORK:

At the allotment stage,

QUESTION:

At the allotment stage.

judgment below disagree with that, do they?

Now, the

5-4
MR. BORK:

One judgment below does.

The Court of

Appeals for the District of Columbia says no, the obligation
stage.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth

Circuit says, the court below found the allotment stage was
correct.

Nobody contests it.
QUESTION:

So we assume it is correct.

Yes, well, insofar as it was held

below, the judgment at the allotment stage, vrouldn't we
have to affirm in that respect?
QUESTION:

If we agreed,

QUESTION:

If we agreed with tha,t.

QUESTION:

Affirm the Fourth Circuit.

QUESTION:

No —

MR. BORK:

Affirming the respect that

discretion is at the allotment stage, I would ask you to
reverse the remand for a trial de novo on the discretion
issue.
QUESTION:

And send it back for dismissal.

MR. BORK:

For dismissal.

QUESTION:

But if we disagreed with you as to when

and said it x^as only at the obligation stage, then we
wouldn’t be reversing the New York case?
MR. BORK:

No, you would not.

QUESTION:

We’d be affirming It,

55
MR. BORK:

But the — the — I suppose the

Fourth Circuit case would drop out and there would be new
litigation when the discretion was exercised at the
obligation stage.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Thompson and

Mr. Jacks, it appears that you have not, until recently,
and perhaps only today, will have received the Supplemental
Brief.

If you find that there is something in the

Supplemental Brief that you would like to comment on, will
you kindly inform the Clerk so that the Court itfill be
advised and for consideration, until we have any comments
that you wish to make?
MR. THOMPSON:

We certainly shall, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:57 o’clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
