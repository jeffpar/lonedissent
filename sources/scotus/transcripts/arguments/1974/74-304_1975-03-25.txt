MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 74”304, Gordon against the New York Stock Exchange,
Mr» Bader, I think you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF 1» WALTON BADER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BADER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case involves the legality of the fixed-commission
rates which have been charged by brokerage houses in the
securities business since the Buttonwood Tree Agreement of 1792,
which of course antedates the passage of the Sherman Antitrust
Act in the 1890Ts.
The minimum-fee schedules charged by the securities
industry brokerage houses thus are the longest sustained
conspiracy in restraint of trade that this country has. ever
seen.
In 1792, the brokerage community got under a buttonwood
tree, and they agreed that they would do the following things;
they first would have minimum commission rates, which would be
charged, and that no broker would have the right to charge
beneath the fixed minimum.
If a broker

r fact charged beneath the fixed minimum,

he would be expelled from the Exchange.

So that we had at that

4
time a clear per se violation of the antitrust laws, but of
course it wasn’t a per se violation of the antitrust lax<?s at
that time, because the Sherman Act hadn't been passed»
QUESTION?

Where was th© Buttonewood Tree, down in

Wall Street somewhere?
MR. BADER:

Down in Wall Street»

It- was a tree,

Mr. Justice Stewart, that was, I think, somewhere around the
present area of Bowling Green, Manhattan, but I don’t want to
be pinned down to that.
In 1890 the Sherman Act was passed, that didn’t,
affect the practice of the brokerage community in charging
fixed rates of commission, and apparently the reason for that
was that the requirements of interstate commerce at that
time had not been broadened by this Court in the decisions
that were passed during tine Rooseveltian New Deal era.

And

therefore that was considered to be a mere local problem, which
/

would not fall within the reach of the antitrust laws.
In 1934, the Securities Act was passed, and in 1934
the Pujc Committee, which was considering the passage of the
Securities Act, considered the practices of the Stock Exchanges,
which had been charging fixed rates of commission in accordance
with the Buttonwood Tree Agreement, and there was discussion
at that time that the fixed ratas of commission again, because
of the restricted decisions of interstate commerce that had
been ir. effect at that time, would probably not go and fall

5

within the reach of the antitrust iatv’s.
But now, when the Securities and Exchange —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bader, what grant of authority was

Congress legislating under to regulate the Securities and
Exchange Commission in '34?
MR. BADER:

Wasn’t that the commerce problem?

Yes, that’s true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

but tiie question of fixed rates of commission, there had been
a discussion in the Pujo Committee.

That does appear

in the Attorney General’s brief, where that legislative history
is set forth.

Where, apparently, the Pujo Committee had felt

that the legislation with respect to commission rates might
possibly be beyond the commerce power of Congress,
I don’t think we have to go that far»

I think the

legislative history amply determines — I will point out in my
subsequent argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the fixed rates
of commission are, per se, illegal, and that the Congress never
intended to give the Securities and Exchange power — the
Exchange Commission regulatory power over commission rates,
which I will get to in a moment.
Now, ■(die Securities and Exchange Act

basically says

that unless there is a specific provision repealing any other
statute with respect to the protection of the public and the
protection of investors, that this, the Securities and Exchange
Act, will not repeal such prior statutory enactment.
However, th® Securities and Exchange Act does have a

6

provision in it, which is Section

I believe it's 19(b) (9)

— Section 19(b)(9), and that section provides that under
certain conditions, which I will allude to a little bit more
fully in my subsequent argument, the Securities and Exchange
Commission has the right to fix reasonable rates of commission»
Now, originally, the proposal that had been put into
that section was to fix uniform rates of commission»

The

word "uniform" was subsequently taken out and the word
"reasonable" was placed therein.
Now, it is absolutely clear, and I think that none
of the other parties arguing this matter will deny that if the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 had not been passed, and
that if the practice of the Stock Exchanges and the brokerage
members thereof, in fixing reasonable — in fixing minimum
rates of commission, were before this Court at this time,
there would h® no question that there would be a per se
violation of the antitrust laws involved.
We have here a conspiracy in restraint of trade,
and with a penalty that if you fail to maintain the minimum
rates of commission, that you become expelled from the
Exchange,
\

However, the Exchanges contend, and the lower courts
in this case also found, that because of the supervisory
ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission in fixing
the various matters in which the Exchange community does busi-

7
n&SBf

therefore there is a different method of regulation

pro­

posed for securities transactions than there is in the normal
course of commerce»

And that whereas I, in selling various

widgets in the marketplace, must abide by the antitrust laws,
I as a member of the Securites and Exchange brokerage conanunity
do not because there is another method of regulation to protect
the public interest.

Namely, a Securities and Exchange Commis­

sion which is standing over the head of the brokerage industry
and insuring fair deding to tine public.
Now, Your Honors are well av?are, of course, of the
large amount of literature that has been written about the
effectiveness of regulatory oversight over an industry, and
that in general regulatory oversight of an industry,is consider­
ably inferior to the regulation by the laws of the marketplace.
What happens, of course, is that the regulatory
agency gets its input primarily from the industry regulated?
whereas the public normally does not have the ability to
put that input into the agency.
But interestingly enough, the 'defendants in tills case
argue for even a more less stringent rule.

They say we are a

self-regulatory agency, the SEC merely has supervisory authority
over our self-regulation, and not — but despite that, despite
the fact that we are not subject to regulations such as, for
example, the railroads are or the airlines are, or the other
regulatory segments of the nation’s economy are? we’re still

a
exempt from the antitrust laws.

And that is what the district

court in effect found, and that is what the circuit court
in effect found, and I submit to this Court that that is not
correct»
As a matter of fact, in this particular case, the
Securities and Exchange Commission really did nothing
effectively against fixed-minimum commission rates until this
action was started.
When this action was started, then the Securities
and Exchange Commission did start considering the particular
problem with respect to minimum commission rates.

7\nd the

first time around, when we participated in a proceeding before
the Securities and Exchange Commission, we of course said that
the fixed-minimum rates were bad in connection with public
interest, and we presented various arguments to the Commission.
The Commission nevertheless agreed to a certain fixed
scale of commission rates, which the State Exchange had
requested.
We went to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, attempting to review that under the Securities
Act provisions with respect to review.

The Securities and

Exchange Commission brought on a motion to dismiss, and that
was in Docket Ho. 71-1924, which was before the Circuit

Court

cf Appeals for the Second Circuit, and in effect the Securities
and Exchange Commission said to that Court:

We have not issued

9

any order, we have not told the Exchanges to do anything? all
we've said is that we wouldn't object to this particular
commission rat© being in effect, and therefore you have no
right of judicial review.
This is not an order, and therefore this does not
fall within the ambit of review granted to you under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,
So we went ahead and we went down to the District.
Court for the District of Columbia,

We said, well, maybe

they're trying to proceed in accordance with the manner of
the Independent Broker-Dealers * case, maybe we’re in the wrong
court, maybe what we really should do is go after the
determination as not constituting an order but constituting
a determination whieh we wanted to review.
We proceeded in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia,
to dismiss.

The SEC promptly filed a brief

And as I quoted on page 6 of my brief, the

Commission in effect saids
"However, the question of the type and extent of
immunity that may flow from Commission determinations regarding
exchange rules ... need not be decided in this case.

The

appropriate forum for resolution of that question is in an
antitrust action against a self-regulatory organization
challenging its rules or the administration of such rules.
Indeed, plaintiffs recognize that they may seek to challenge

10
exchange rules directly; they have instituted suit against tine
New York Stock Exchange for this very purpose,"

which is

this action which is now.pending before this honorable Court,
The SEC, while this action was pending, then made a
further study <£ 'the commission rate structure, and based upon
the further study they permitted fixed-commission rates to
remain in effect in accordance with the proposal that the New
York Stock Exchange had submitted and which we opposed in another
proceeding before the Commission, and the Commission at that
point, while determining that their jurisdiction was in effect
and that they would, on May 1st, 1975, mandate the end of
fixed-commission rates, they nevertheless held that prior to
that time, essentially the proposal presented by the New
York Stock Exchange for maintaining fixed-commission rates would
be permitted to stand,
V7e again went to the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit,

Again the SEC came in and

said this is no order, you can't review it.

The Court of

Appeals for the Second Circuit, without opinion again, dismissed
the petition.
And again we had no judicial review.
Meanwhile, this case was coming along.

We went to

the Second Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to this deter­
mination, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals came along and
said;

Well, we feel that the fixed-commission rates under the

11
oversight of the New York stock Exchange constitute the
appropriate administrative regulatory authority, and therefor©
constitute the, quote, ‘'different case", close quotes, that
this Court held to be involved in the Silver case, where they
held that there was no specific antitrust immunity with
respect to the New York Stock Exchange or with respect to
matters that the self-regulatory agency carried out? but,
nevertheless, there might be an area of immunity if it was
necessary to make the Securities Act work»
Well, the Circuit Court of Appeals said that this is
the different case necessary to make the Securities Act work?
and they therefore held that there was no antitrust liability
on the part of the defendant exchanges.
Interestingly enough, the Circuit Court of
Appeals said*

We do not say that the petitioner does not have

an appropriate forum for judicial review»
How we are supposed to get judicial review is
some-chin g I don't know.

We've been to six courts already and

we still haven't gotten judicial review.
Now, I say this to this Courts
First, the Court has held, in the Silver case, that
the self-regulatory agencies, such as the securities industry,
does not have a blanket immunity from the antitrust laws.

So

that the immunity in each case must be considered on a caseby-case basis.

12

This is not the "different case" that is necessary to
make the Securities Act work#
The fixation of commission rates by the Securities
and Exchange Commission is not necessary to make the Securities
Act work —
QUESTION:

Let's assume the Commission had set a

schedule of fees, ordered it into effect#
MR. BADER:

Yes#

QUESTION:

Yes#

MR# BADER:
to do it,

A schedule of minimum fees?

I don't think they would have the power

I think that what they x-muld have to do
QUESTION:

power to do it.

Well, let’s assume that it did have the

And up until today it hasn't done it, but

then, all of a sudden, it does order it into effect#

Would

you then say that the Antitrust Division would be put out of
business for a while at least?
MR, BADER:
QUESTION:

That's a very interesting question#
Yes, it is, but it's —

MR. BADER:

A very interesting question,

[Laughter,]
QUESTION:

But you say at least until it does that,

there is no — it isn't necessary, they haven't done it and so
it can't be necas3ary.
MR. BADER:

Well, that's precisely it.

precisely what I do say.

That*s

And I say that the Act — the Act,

13
furthermore , does not provide for the fixation of rates of
commission.

It says to fix reasonable rates of commission,

Nov?, tliis is the reason why it was done, in ray
opinion, but of course I*ra not a — I was not in Congress at
the time, and I don't have the wisdom to know what Congress
really intended.
But when the Congress took the word "uniform” out
and put the word "reasonable" in, I would think that it would
be logical to consider that what Congress really wanted to do
was thist

they wanted the marketplace to fix commission

rates.
However, if tine marketplace, for on© reason or
another, didn't do it properly, so that the rates were
excessive, then I think the Securities and Exchange Commission
could come in and fix the rates,

And the reason for it is

that the fixation of rates her© is not the usual fixation of
rates that is provided for in the normal regulatory statute.
In the normal regulatory statute, the regulatory
agency holds hearings to determine what a reasonable rate is
to be, such as the Federal Power Act, and the utility
involved, attempting to justify a rate, comes in with their
cost data, comes in with their fixed rates, their fixed
expenses, the public who oppose the rate increase come in and
attempt to argue against this.
determination

And the agency then makes a

This isn't the x\ray this is done»
In this case the Commission has to first ask the
Exchange to supplement its rules»

Then if the Exchange doesn't

do it, then the Commission can go ahead and order a hearing, and
after that hearing, can direct the Exchange to do it with the
Exchange then having the right of normal appeal review»
I think that in my opinion, for whatever it’s worth,
— and it's probably not worth very much — that the determina­
tion here was only with respect to excessive rates of
commission, and that the minimum rates of commission that were
involved here at this point are, of course, not excessive
rates of commission.
QUESTION*

Do I remember correctly from reading the

briefs that the change from the word "uniform" to the word
"reasonable" was made after some testimony by Mr, Samuel
Untermeyer before the committee?
MR. BADER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
In which he took the position that -*• what

do you remember?
MR, BADER:

I believe he took the position that

there was a question as to whether or not the Commission did
have the right to determine — to fix commission rates in
view of the non-interstate aspect of the stockbrokers'
commission field.
QUESTION:

In the view of the lav; at that time?

15
MR, BADER:

In view of, and it was under the law

at that time, sir,
QUESTION:

Unh-hurih.

And beyond that, is there

any legislative history that you know of explaining the word
change from "uniform" to "reasonable"?
MR, BADER:

Not that I know of.

All I can say is

that I have attempted to find that; my learned colleague from
«

the SEC has attempted to find that; my learned colleauge from
the Department of Justice attempted to find that,

I think

we've had one of the most thorough expositions of the law
that anybody could hope for, and that's all we've been able to
come up with,
QUESTION:

His testimony and then the subsequent

change and the like?
MR. BADER:
QUESTION:
MR, BADER:

His testimony and the subsequent change,
Unh-hunh *
I'm not sure whether or not the legis-

lative history is really necessary in this particular case to
make a determination.

I think that the fact that you have

a clear per sa violation involved, plus the determination of
this Court in Otter Tail, plus the Silver case, would seem
to indicate to me that we may not have to go that far.
But all I can tell Your Honor is that that's all
that I've bean able to find.
QUESTION:

Right

16
MR* BADER:

Now, the only thing that I have further

to say — I've just about run out of ray time — was that the
Court did have a very similar case in, of course, Otter Tail
Power Company v> United States, and there it is perfectly well
within the statutory and regulatory scheme to have regulatory
agency oversight over a group of individuals or a trade and,
at the same time, to make the trade subject to the antitrust
laws.
QUESTION*

Could I ask you, does the Exchange — or

does the Commission purport to have any authority to adjudicate
particular violations of its rules?
MR. BADER:

Well, that —

QUESTION*

Or is it just --

MR. BADER*

— there is — the Commission of course

does have power to proceed against violations of the Act, and
has proceeded against violations of the Act in a number of
cases*

And at the same time individuals have the right to

proceed against violations of the Act.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume the Commission did put out a

*— assume it had the power to, and that it did propound a
minimum charge for brokers, and then an individual broker
didn't live up to the rule.

Could the Commission move against

him?
MR. BADER:
could,

I would think the Commission probably

under those circumstances.

I wonder whether or not,

17
in view of the statutory provisions involved , that if the
Commission did do something of that kind, whether the Commis­
sion itself might not be subject to attack for exceeding its
authority»
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh,

Well, I understand your

position on that.
MR, BADBR:

I thank this Court for its considera­

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS
CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© the

Court:
Subsequent to the grant of the writ in this case,
the Securities and Exchange Commission, on January 23rd, this
year, adopted Securities and Exchange Act Rule 19b-3.
This rule prospectively abolishes fixed commission rates to
the public, effective May 1st, 1975? and as co members or
associated members of the Exchanges, in what*s called floor
brokerage, as of May 1st next year.
The decision appears in the Securities Exchange
Commission Documentary Appendix at page 109, and 1*11 refer to
it from time to time in my argument.
It conaisely reviews the history of Exchange price-

13
fixing before and after the Securities Act of 1934, and sets
forth very effectively the reasons why the problem has not been
given attention until the last decade.
Th© position of the United States as amicus curia©
is that when Congress enacted Section 19(b), it created no
blanket exemption from the antitrust laws.

Instead, the

question of exemption should be resolved by the method
defined in Silver v. New York Stock Exchange.
Respondent’s contention that this method is inapplic­
able really amounts to a reassertion of the same claim of
blanket immunity which they advanced in the Silver case, and
which the Court rejected in Silver as to the application of the
method.
Now, under the Silver test, as applied to Section
19(b), including Section 19(h)*s express reference to the
fixing of rates of commission, the usual antitrust standards
are changed.

Silver indicates that there must be a particular­

ized inquiry to determine whether Exchange rules within 19(b)
are necessary, but no more restrictive than necessary to make
the Securities and Exchange Act work.
Thus, exemption is implied only when an irreconcilable
*

conflict is found as to

particular instances of Exchange

self-regulation.
Now, this accommodation of the antitrust and regulatory
requirements serves to reconcile the statutory schemes, rather

19
than to hold one or the other ousted,,

It rests on the Court's

recognition that the antitrust laws and the regulatory scheme
of the Exchange Act are complementary, not antithetical.
Now, its application here, we think, is confirmed
by Ricci v, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Merrill Lynch v.
Ware,

The question of whether, when this method of Silver

is applied in this case, an exemption actually arises cannot
be answered on this record.
The courts below did not attempt to make the Silver
type inquiry.

They found a blanket exemption.

Now, sllver did three things.
As I have said, first,

it defined a method for

reconciling antitrust laws and the duty of collective self-*
regulation, which the Exchange Act requires.
Second, in Silver, the Court applied the method to
the case before it and made a determination in the circum­
stances of that case as to exemption*

Thus, whether there is

exemption or nonexemption is really a product of the applica­
tion of the Silver method.
And the third thing the Court did in Silver was to
state that a different case as to exemption would arise where
the Act provided SEC jurisdiction and ensuing judicial review
of particular Exchange rulings.
So what was reserved in Silver was not the method
for reconciling the two statutes, that is the requirement for

20
a particularized inquiry? the Court reserved decision on the
effect of SEC jurisdiction on cases where the SEC has
jurisdiction and where there *s ensuing judicial review when
the Silver test is applied to particular instances of Exchange
self-regulation.
Now, the Court in Silver was fully aware of Section
19(b) and its relation to the rules of the Exchange.

Because,

in this case, we are dealing with a jurisdiction over rules,
the rules fixing commission rates, as listed in Section
19 (b).
The Court, in footnote 16 of the Silver decision —
at page 364 — assumed that under Section 19(b) the SEC could
adopt a rule imposing that very notice and hearing requirements
whose absence from the Exchange rules involved in that case
had led the Court to the conclusion that there was no
justification to support the exemption under the 1934 Act.
Since the record in that case fully explored the question of
necessity, and there was no possible basis on which the SEC
could find that notice and hearing were not required by the
1934 Act, the Court itself resolved the exemption question,
despite the SEC's reserved jurisdiction over Exchange rules0
Now, because Section 19(b) expressly refers to the
fixing of commission rates, we have to consider the effect
of that language.
Section 19(b) does not authorize the Exchanges to

21

do anything.

It confers a reserved or secondary jurisdiction

on the SEC over any rules the Exchanges may adopt in carrying
out their duty of self-regulation» which fall within the
enumeration of particular matters contained in Section 19(b)«
In our view it adds to the panoply of remedies
available under existing law.
Section 28 of the Exchange Act expressly declares that
the rights and remedies defined by the Exchange Act are in
addition to all others that may exist at law or equity.
With respect to Section lS(b)*s reference to fixed
commissions» we agree» subject to qualifications that 1*11 state»
with the SEC*s brief at page 11» where it says» "Congress
recognized the existence of fixed commissions but chose neither
to outlaw that practice nor to endorse it» but rather to bring
it tinder the complete control of the Commission."
I express three qualifications to that.
First» Congress gave the Commission complete but not
exclusive power within the purposes of the Exchange Act.
Second» Congress recognized price-fixing» as it had
existed since 1792» but did not endorse it.
And third, Congress neither condemned nor endorsed
what it had recognised.
So that the fixing of commission rates is tints per­
mitted as a matters of securities law until the SEC acts on the
practice, as it now has? but, even though it*s permitted under

22
the Securities Act, that's not enough.

It's fundamental that

even though a practice may be permitted under a regulatory
statute, that does not exempt it from the antitrust law.
Thus, with the Power Commission's approval, the
acquisition of the Northwest Pipeline Comp any by El Paso
Natural Gas was permitted by the Natural Gas Act? but it was
still subject to antitrust scrutiny, as in California v, PPCa
And the banks that merged in Philadelphia with the
approval of the Comptroller of the Currency were permitted to
do so under the old Bank Merger Act, but they still had to
pass muster under the antitrust laws.
Now, the amici and the respondents have reviewed
the legislative history of the 1934 Act at some length.
What it boils dovm to is this:
Congress knew about commission rate-fixing by
Exchanges, but it never specifically considered the practice
in relation to the antitrust laws.

I think the history is

well summarized in the Commission's decision abolishing
fixed commission rates, where, at pages 116 and 117 of the
SEC's Documentary Appendix, the Commission says that Congress
was ”focused primarily upon such obvious evils as comers,
pools, manipulations, insider trading, and other fraudulent
and deceptive practices which seriously injured investors.
With respect to commission rates, there was some concern that
the possible overcharging — with the possible overcharging of

23
unsophisticated investors, and with possible monopoly profits ,
and the Commission was therefore given regulatory authority,1*
As the SEC's report on 19b-3

also shows, Congress

didn't substitute pervasive public utility type regulation for
competition, it just doesn't fit this industry.

Thus the

assemption -that the antitrust laws are ousted because the
regulatory scheme leaves no room for them, oven where there'a a
reference to rate-fixing, cannot be sustained here.
What Congress adopted was a system of private
initiative and self-regulation subject to a reserved Commission
oversight.
Wow, where there is a system in which an industry is
given collective power to control its own affairs through
voluntary commercial relationships, governed in the first
instance by private business judgment, then it cannot be
assumed that the antitrust laws are overridden, absent some
expression by Congress,
QUESTIONt

Or by the Commission,

MR, SHAPIRO:

Or by the Commission,

And that opens

another aspect of it,
I said a moment ago that the SEC's jurisdiction is
complete,

I think that the Commission could, in an appropriate

case, make a determination that fixed commissions are required.
And at least as far as the antitrust laws are concerned, that
would be the end of the matter* since the —

24

QUESTION:

But you do maintain — you take that

position in your brief and you maintain it here, that if the
Commission

that the Commission does have — would have the

power to do that, and that if it did it, then there would be
an irreconcilable conflict between antitrust laws and — so
that the antitrust principles must give way?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

The Exchange would

be under an enforcible — under a duty which is onforcible
against them to obey the SEC"s order.
Now, the SEC’s report on 19b-3 also reflects that
until —
QUESTION:

I*m not sure that I track that with

what you said just previously about Congress not giving the
Securities end Exchange Commission exclusive power, but only
a shared power — at least I got that impression.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

If I got the wronq impression —

MR. SHAPIRO:
it.

Yes, Your Honor.

No, it is a shared power, as we view

And the answer lies in the fact, as occurs elsewhere

in the law, that there may be overlapping jurisdictions
where the regulatory agency has some powers to compel conduct
not authorized, or otherwise authorized by the antitrust
laws.
QUESTION:

But I understood you to say to Mr.

Justice White just now that if they exercise the power, then

25
that ousts the antitrust jurisdictions
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes,

Or did I misunderstand you then?

MR, SHAPIRO:

No, I think you understood me correctly,

Your Honor,
The question is — it turns on x^hether they actually
require the particular conduct —
QUESTION:
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

In an enforcible way? I see,
In an en-forcible way.

That is it,

I see the distinction.

If they do it and actually carry it out in good faith,
then the antitrust is set aside?
MR, SHAPIRO:

Well, no, not -— if they volunteer *—

well, the scheme in Section 19(b) is a little peculiar, because
it does call first for a request from the Commission to the
Exchange, and if the Exchange complies with just the request,
it*s doing so voluntarily, it's not compelled to do so,
We xtfould say in that situation the necessary to make the Act.
work would apply, the Silver case x-rould apply.
I can envision a range of activities.

If the SEC

requests fixed-commission rates, and the Exchanges comply,
without a formal 19(b) proceeding, the Silver test applies,
If the SEC accompanies its request with a public —
with a reasoned determination of necessity, which it usually
does, and it simply reqxxests that the change be made, this

26

has to be given appropriate weight by the antitrust laws.
Now, if the SEC disapproves or terminates the rule,
well, then, of course, there's no defense under tine Silver
test at all, there's nothing left.
If the SEC orders price-fixing after a 19(b) pro­
ceeding, the Silver test doesn't apply.

If the Exchange —

I mean if the SEC simply acquiesces or tolerates or takes no
action in what the Exchanges have been doing over the years,
then the silver test applies? there's no immunity from that.
Finally, I suppose one could say that if the SEC
determines, as it argues it has here, that rates should be
phased out step-by-step, this determination of a need for a
transition period has to be weighed with the rest of the
Silver test.
Now, one of the questions that comes up whenever wa
discuss this is*

Why has everyone waited until now to start

talking about the validity of fixed-commission rates, after
all these years of —
QUESTION:
Mr, Shapiro,

Let me see if I'm clear about this,

At page 48 of your brief you say, "If the SEC

were to order the exchanges to adhere to a fixed commission
rat© system of some kind, no antitrust liability could arise,"
MR, SHAPIRO*
QUESTION?

That's correct,
And what you're telling us is that that

is the only situation where immunity is clear.

27
MR, SHAPIRO:

Where the immunity is clear, yes,

Your Honor,
QUESTION: And all other situations, anything short of
that, then th© Silver test applies?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Than the Silver test applies,

Yes.

MR. SHAPIRO:

With various amounts of weight being

given to what the SEC has done in relation to the Exchange rule#
I was about to mention the long period which had gone
by without anyone challenging these rules.
Now, the SEC report on Section 19b-3, at page 136, I
think succinctly summed that up also.
the Special Study of

It reflects that until

Securities Markets was published in 1963,

everyone just sort of assumed that

fixed commission rates were

normal, and a necessary feature of the exchange market.
Nobody, the Antitrust Division, private bar, the SEC itself,
had questioned the assumption, either as a matter of economic
policy or tinder the antitrust laws, or even under the Securities
Exchange Act, as the report points out at page 118,
Now, the Special Study itself did not address this
particular problem of fixed commission rates.

But it found that

the practice of fixed commission rates was leading to attempts
to evade them on such a massive scale, particularly by
injtitutional investors, that the system was not only not working,
it was harming the industry.

And this, over the years, slowly.

28

led the SEC to conclude that there was a need to abolish them»
And it has finally cone to that conclusion this year.
There’s a further argument made about applying the
Silver test in the context of this case.

That i3, that as a

matter of policy it*s going to have severe adverse effects on
the industry» that the administration of the Act will be
paralyzed because exchanges will be afraid to carry out their
duty of self-regulation.
Silver has led to no such paralysis, nor have there
been any hind of flood of antitrust cases challenging every
aspect of Commission rule making.
The handful of cases have concerned the consequences
of price-fixing, and most of the antitrust problems will
disappear with its abolition.
The possibility that Exchange rules may be tested
under s3-3-ver in a Sherman Act suit itfill have a salutary
effect upon the Exchanges* exercise of their duty of self­
regulation.
QUESTION:

Just a minute.

If the Court were to

hold that the power given to the SEC, whether exercised or
not, preempts the antitrust laws, then whether the Commission
has a rule or whether it doesn’t, or whether it requires
price-fixing or whether it forbids it, the antitrust law
jut.t would have no application.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's right.

If the Act —if the

29

Court construes the Act as conferring a blanket immunity —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION*

— then you never worry about —
Well, had immunity in this area.

MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION;

In this area, that's —
Well, I take it that that's the position

of some people in this case, that this reserved

this granted,

but unexercised power, preempts the antitrust laws.
MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION*

That is the contention.

Yes.

MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION*

And our answer to that is that that —
Well, you just answer Silver —

MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION*

We answer Silver in reachinq —
«*aa>-rru--» tvyyx----.*. s

Right.

MR. SHAPIRO*

And also using Merrill Lynch v. Ware,

because, just using that word ’’preemption" for a moment, in
a State preemption case the Silver analysis was applied.
QUESTION *

Yes.

MR. SHAPIRO*

Now, the point that I'm really making

is that under those cases, the determination of preemption,
if you want to use that, or exemption or immunity, is not made
in the abstract on the face of the statute.

It is applied to

particularized instances of Exchange action, and it takes a
record to do that, which doesn't exist here.
QUESTION*

Now, what's the antitrust situation under

30
the new order, after it becomes effective?
MRa SHAPIRO?
QUESTION:

The new order?

The one you told us about,

QUESTION:

Effective May 1st,

QUESTION:

Yes, May 1st* this year,

MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Abolishing fined commission rates?
Yes,

MR, SHAPIRO:

Well, onos that becomes affective,

there will be no defense under Silver for any price-fining
thereafter,
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but there would if — there

would if the Commission power preempts the antitrust laws,
MR. SHAPIRO:

If it does, that's right, sir,

QUESTION: And if it did, it would have the exclusive
power to enforce or not to enforce its rules,
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's right.

Our contention, of

course, —
QUESTION:
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.
— goes to the claim that there is

no blanket immunity but a more particularized immunity,
QUESTION:
MR, SHAPIRO:
which is argued.

Yes.
I was discussing the policy question,

Of course, when we talk about policy her®,

you must recognize that policy has to be assessed under
existing lav;.

It's the antitrust laws as they stand, and the

31
Securities Act as it stands# without any express immunity;
of
and of course, the principle that repeals/the antitrust laws
by implication from a regulatory scheme are strongly disfavored.
There are policy arguments that the SEC should have
absolute authority in this area, that the Exchanges should be
completely immune.

But this is not the forum in which that

hind of a broad contention can be made.
If it is to be considered, I point out that there are
30me important arguments the other way.

The possibility that

Exchange rules will be tested in the Sherman Act suit will have
a salutary effect upon the Exchange's exercise of their duty of
self-regulation.

They will be stimulated to scrutinize

closely any rules involving seriously anticompetitive conse­
quences, to be certain that they are actually necessary to make
the Exchange Act work.
The SEC will benefit, because the heightened
attention to the Act's requirements by the Exchanges under the
stimulus of the Silver test, with its attendant minimization
of practices that do not benefit investors will reduce the
need for regulatory intervention by the SEC itself.
Far from having a chilling effect, therefore, we
think that continued application of the Sherman Act will serve
to complement that self-regulation under the SEC's reserved
jurisdiction.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.

32

Mr. Jackson, you may proceed whenever you*re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM ELDRED JACKSON, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JACKSONs

Mr, Chief Justice, members of the

Courts
I think I am not going too far when I say that the
position taken by the Department of Justice in this case is
nothing less than an effort to exalt the antitrust laws to a
quasi-constitutional status.

A status in which this

particular statute is a far greater force than another later
statute passed by Congress, with which the antitrust laws
are inconsistent.
I think this is the most extreme position the
Department has taken with respect to the doctrine of implied
repeal that I know of.

Because inherent in its position

that there is no exemption here is that the following circum­
stances are of no moment whatsoever.
First, that the Exchanges are authorized and
permitted by the Exchange Act to adopt rules fixing commis­
sions.
Secondly, that Congress created the SEC to act as
the guardian of the public interest in supervising and changing,
if necessary, rules relating to commissions, under regulatory
standards that are broader than those of the antitrust laws.
And thirdly, despite the references to the regulators,

33
as this record shows, that the SEC has actively exercised these
powers and has been an active watchdog,,
Indeed, major changes, seven of them, in Commission
rules of Exchanges have taken place in the past seven years.
All of them at the request or with the approval of the SEC,
and after hearings in which the Department of Justice
participated.
All this

counts for naught in the Department's world

of antitrust absolutism.

There can be no antitrust exemption

here, despite a perfectly apparent head-on collision between
the antitrust laws and the Exchange Act,
And this means that in any case, and in every case,
where a rule of an Exchange is challenged under the antitrust
laws, if this theory were to apply, there would have to be a
trial de novo of the facts, even after review and approval,
and even after modification of the rule in question by the
SEC,

And this would be a trial under the standards not of

the Exchange Act, but of the antitrust laws.
This is to ignore the Exchange Act, This is to
second-guess the SEC,

This is to say that Exchanges should be

regulated by district courts with the aid of the Department of
Justice and with the assistance of juries, rather than by the
expert agency to which Congress has created the task.
With the greatest of respect, I submit that this is
dogma run wild.

And that it was properly rejected by the lower

34

courts•
I would submit, Your Honors, that the question before
the Court is that which was left open in Silver,

The different

case, with respect to antitrust exemption, where the SEC has
jurisdiction over the practice attacked.

We submit, of course,

that this is the case, the different case, and that its
resolution has been foreshadowed in Silver itself.
There is no issue her© of blanket inununity for
Exchanges or for all Exchange activities 0

As this Court

recognized in the Hughes case, a regulatory scheme may not be
sufficiently pervasive to result in a total exemption? but,
nevertheless, it may result in exemption in particular and
discreet instances,
That*s all we're dealing with here.

Because the

issue here of antitrust exemption relates only to a single
aspect of Exchange activities*

the fixing of reasonable

rates of commission to be charged by members, as permitted
by Section 19(b)(9) of the Exchange Act, subject to SEC review
jurisdiction.
Now, the Buttonwood Tree has been referred to, and
it is not without significance, I submit, that commission
rate-fixing by Exchanges has been enaged in in this country,
openly and above-board, since the Buttonwood

Tree Agreement

in 1792.
We all know horizontal price-fixing and rate-fixing

35
by competitors has been unlawful at least since the passage
of the Sherman Act, and yet exchange comraission rate-fixing
was not challenged by the Department of Justice at ail* prior
to the Exchange Act of 1934, despite this Court's ruling in
Trenton Potteries that price-fixing was per se unlawful.
And then Congress, in 1934, in enacting the Exchange
Act, an Act which we all recognize was designed to correct
abuses, nevertheless permitted the exchanges to continua their
historic and well-known practice of fixing rates of commission.
Subject, however, for the first time , to regulation
of that practice by a government agency.
And in giving the SEC jurisdiction to review those
rates, the standards established by the Act were those of
reasonableness and other standard listed in the Act, the
primary one of which was the protection of investors.
So that after the passage of the Exchange Act, the
Exchanges were no longer engaging in unfettered rate-fixing
by custom, but they were engaging in statutorily permitted and
government supervised rate-fixing, which even the Seventh
Circuit, in the Thill case — with which we thoroughly disagree
— described as a system of authorized price-fixing.
And so the question is whether Congress, by providing
for SEC supervised commission-fixing in Section 19(b)(9) of the
Exchange Act, intended by necessary implication to exclude such
commission-fixing from the 3cope of the antitrust laws.

36
QUESTIONS

Well, what if the Commission doesn't

fix, what if it's just a power which has been granted to the
SEC, is it your position that just the grant of the power —
MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION:

It is, Your Honor? yes, indeed,
— whether it exercises it or whether

it doesn't —
MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION*

Exactly.
— or whether it forbids it or whether

it permits it, or whether it requires it.
MR, JACKSON*

Exactly.

It's still a conflict of

regulatory schemes, a conflict of jurisdictions? the existence
of the power is sufficient.
On that point we think the Thill Court went off the
track,
QUESTION*

Well, suppose the Commission has —

the Exchange has a rule, which it does, on commissions, and
the SEC says nothing at all about it, and you say the anti­
trust laws have nothing to do with it,
MR, JACKSON*

We say that that commission*»fixing is

authorized —
QUESTION*

Well, that isn't commission-fixing,

I mean it hasn't fixed anything, it just hasn't disapproved
t

an Exchange rule,
MR, JACKSON*

No, sir? but we say the commission-

fixing by the Exchange, being passively permitted by the SEC, —

37
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR, JACKSON*

— is not subject to the antitrust

laws o
QUESTION:

But in that event does the SEC have any

authority to enforce specific violations of the Exchange rul©?
MR» JACKSON:
QUESTION*

Of the fixed-coranission rule?
Yes.

It areally doesn’t, does it?
MR, JACKSON*
QUESTION*

No# I don’t think so, Your Honor,
So that if the Commission rule «— if the

Exchange rule is going to be enforced at all, the Exchange
enforces it?
MR. JACKSON*

Yes, that’s right.

That’s right.

And has done so.
QUESTION:

And so if certain brokers engage in price**

fixing inconsistent with the Exchange rule, that’s an Exchange
matter? right?
MR, JACKSON*

Yes, it is, T hey would b© violating

th© Exchange rule.
QUESTION*

Thank you.

MR. JACKSON*

Or might bo engaging in other practices

which would be inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade under the Exchange Act.
We submit, Your Honors, that a pro tanto implied
repeal of the antitrust laws in this case is compelled by two

A

38
separate considerations»
The first is the doctrine of repugnancy, which
applies where the application of the antitrust laws would
collide with the regulatory schema of a later statute»
We submit that the Sherman Act prohibition against
horizontal rate-fixing simply cannot be reconciled with the
Exchange Act provisions permitting commission-fixing.
Because the Exchange Act authorizes» under government aegis»
the very conduct which is prohibited by the earlier statute.
The two statutes we think cannot be harmonized.
One says "thou shalt not"» the other says "thou may"; and
one must yield to the other.
And under the cases of this Court we think it*s
perfectly plain that the earlier statute must give way to the
later one» as the expression of Congress's intent on this
particular matter.
QUESTION:

What if the Commission comes along and

says "thou shalt not"?
MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION:
MR, JACKSON:
QUESTION:

That's what it has done,
Yes.
And —
And then its sanctions would be the

exclusive sanctions» I take it?
MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION:

Yes,
According to your position?

39

tfR, JACKSON t
QUESTIONs

Yes , Your Honor.

That*s right.

And the antitrust laws would still have

MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION*

Would still have no effect.
— no effect.

MR, JACKSON:

For two reasons.

One is the

existence of Commission authority? and the other is the rule
which they have adopted, which we think has the effect of an
order.

It’s were semantics to talk about a formal order.

Where they have the power to order you to do something, and
you comply with their request, without forcing them to go through
an order procedure, the result should be the same.
QUESTION:

They would order you to adopt a rule,

really, that there shall be no price-fixing, or there shall be
no uniform fee.
MR. JACKSON:

That’s right, and that’s what they

did.
QUESTION:

And that’s what they did.

So it still is

an Exchange rule?
MR, JACKSON*

It is — it will be an Exchange rule

adopted in conformity with the SEC rule.
QUESTION:

And still not be — and in the case of

individual violations, still a matter for the Exchange to
enforce.
MR. JACKSON:

Yes, Your Honor

40
QUESTION s

Unh-h unh.

QUESTION:

And policed only by the Exchange.

MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

What would the power of the Commission be

if they thought there was a breakdown in enforcement?
MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION:

By the Exchange?
Yes. What would be SEC's — the

Commission's power be?
MR. JACKSON:

Well, since the change in the

Exchange rule will have been adopted pursuant to an SEC rule,
adopted under the Act, then I think the full panoply of power
is available to the Commission for violations of the Act to
come into play, including, at the most extreme of course,
deregistration of exchanges, also termination of the officers
of exchanges, and of course civil and criminal proceedings
are available for violations of the Act.
QUESTION:

There are no remedies for any person

{

hurt by a violation?
MR. JACKSON:

Yes.

There is a remedy, which is

provided by the Administrative Procesures Act; also a remedy
provided -QUESTION:

How about damages?

MR. JACKSON:

Damage remedies would not be provided,

nor are they required, I would submit.
QUESTION:

But if there are violations, the

41
Excii ange rule against fixed fees* and someone violates it, and
somebody is hurt by it, there are no damage remedies?
MR» JACKSON:

Well, there might be»

There is a

developing body of law in which individuals have sought to
sue for violation of Exchange rules,

Yes»
