MORNING SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Smith, you

10:02 am
We’ll resume arguments.

may proceed whenever you are

ready.
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
When the Court adjourned yesterday, I had set
forth the facts of this case which are essentially that an
Internal Revenue Service summons was served upon Respondent,
an officer of the Bank, in order to determine the identity
of the depositor or transferor of some 400 $100 bills that
were in seriously deteriorated condition.
The summons was drawn in the matter of the tax
liability of John Doe because the identity of the depositor
was xtfhat the Internal Revenue Service wanted to ascertain.
Now, Respondent refused to comply and after a
hearing held In the United States District Court, brought
by the Government, the District Court narrowed the summons
to require production of all cash deposit tickets equalling
$20,000 during a one-month period, October l6th, 1970 to
November 16th, 1970 since the Federal Reserve Bank in
Cincinnati had received these — this cash on November 6th,
I think and ten or fifteen days later and also —
QUESTION:

''Deposit tickets equalling $20,000,"

do you mean the deposit tickets in which the single amount

10

of $20,000 would have been indicated as having been
deposited?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, that was one part of the order.

The second part of the order involved production
of deposit tickets of cash equal to or in excess of $5,000.
The District Court felt that in that way, by
narrovjing the summons in that regard, the identity of the
depositor could be ascertained with a minimum of disruption
to the Bank.
Now, the Respondent appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which reversed and it is the
correctness of that statutory ruling which is involved in
this case.
The Court of Appeals held that the Internal
Revenue Service has no statutory authority to issue a
summons before it has discovered the identity of the
particular person it wishes to investigate.
I think before I discuss the statute in some
detail, I think it important to state at the outset what
this case does not involve.
This case does not involve any application of a
constitutional protection to the production of records by
the Bank.

I think that the Court’s decision last term in

California Banker’s Association has made clear that there is
no claim of privilege against self-incrimination which would

11
be applicable by the Bank, its officers or on behalf of this
unknown taxpayer or taxpayers who may be incriminated by the
records sought by the summons.
These are third-party records which are not
protective.
The case, therefore, presents a statutory question
the narrow focus of which is upon tvro provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code which are presently set forth at
Section 7601 and 7602 of the Code.
They are set forth on pages 2 and 3 —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

7801?
7601 of the Code.

They are set forth

on pages 2 and 3 of our brief under the caption, ’’Statutes
involved."
Now, these statutes, we submit, are cast in the
broadest possible terms.

Section 7601 admonishes the

Secretary or the Treasurer or his delegate, here the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to proceed from time to
time to each Internal Revenue District and inquire after
and concerning all persons therein who may be liable to
pay any Internal Revenue tax.
Section 7602, which affords the Service the
summons power desip^ned to implement this canvass power in
Section 7601 also is cast in broad terms and it is these
two statutes which the Court recognized in the Donaldson

12
case to be both closely related and rooted In statutes
enacted more than a century ago which we believe provide
the statutory power for the Internal Revenue Service to
issue a summons like this involved in the case.
QUESTION:

When you say that these are the two

statutes involved, that is really an issue in this case,
isn't it?

Your brother says that 7601 is not involved in

this case, that we look to 7602.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Mr. Justice, I am aware that

there is dispute about 7601 but in our view the statute thatthe power that the Internal Revenue Service which we believe
that Congress has accorded — it can be viewed by looking at
these statutes in tandem,
QUESTION:

And, indeed, the Court of Appeals

limited its consideration to the language of 7602, did it
not?
MR. SMITH:

I believe so.

I believe so.

If I may, I would like to consider in detail the
terminology of these statutes which I think are critical to
a resolution of this case.
As I said, Section 7601 talks about a canvass
power of the Internal REvenue Service to proceed from time
to time and it talks about"inquiring after and concerning
all persons," in our view, a broad phrase.
Now, when you get down to Section 7602, the statute

13
talks about four purposes for which a summons like this
can be issued.
It talks about the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return, for making a return where none
has been made, of determining the liability of any person
for any Internal Revenue tax or collecting any such liability
and we think that the summons in this case plainly falls
within the statutory purposes.
QUESTION:
Stewart on this.

You may have answered Mr. Justice

If so, I missed it.

If you did not have 7601, would 7602 be enough to
take care of your case?
MR. SMITH:

We believe it would.

We believe it

would because we think that the summons that was issued In
this case falls within the statutory purposes of Section
7602 alone.
When we are talking about the purpose of
ascertaining the correctness of any return and making a
return where none has been made, et cetera, et cetera, we
think that the proper way to view this case is as the
Initiation of a process in which these statutory purposes
are fully applicable.
In this particular case, the Internal Revenue
Service does not know the identity of the depositor whose
transactions are indeed suspicious.

I think it is

14
undisputed that these transactions are suspicious and,
presumably, once the identity is ascertained by the summons
power3 then the Internal Revenue Service will go on to
ascertain the correctness of the

depositor’s returns, make

the return if none has been made, determine his liability
under the third purpose and so forth and so on.
In fact, the third purpose of the statute,
determining the liability of any person for any Internal
Revenue tax, we think is sufficiently broad enough to cover
this case because what we are talking about here is — the
statute does not confine itself in the way that the Court
of Appeals confined it to a determination of the tax
liability of an identified person.
Rather, it talks about the liability of any
person for any Internal Revenue tax and we think that what
Congress has done here is to accord the Internal Revenue
Service power to answer what we think is the basic, fun­
damental question in the enforcement of any law.
That is, who is responsible?

Who has breached

his responsibility under the lav;?
In the context of the Revenue statute, it is
simply a question of who has not fulfilled his civil tax
liability.

That is what is involved here and we think the

statute covers it.
Wow, v;hat the Court said — that is, the Court of

15
Appeals, is that there is no particular taxpayer under
investigation.
Nov/, in our view, that is not correct in any
sense that is meaningful when one considers the Service’s
statutory responsibility to ascertain and to go through the
Internal Re\renue District and to determine the liability of
any person.
It is only correct in the sense, which we think
is a trivial sense, that the identity of the person has not
been ascertained as yet.

But there is no doubt in this

case that there is a particularized person under investiga­
tion here.
QUESTION:

There is doubt as to whether or not

there is any tax liability.

That is just a suspicion,

isn't it?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, it is a suspicion, but —
Tax liability by anybody, any person

or any other entity — or any kind of tax.
MR. SMITH:

Indeed.

But we think that an event

has occurred here which has properly raised the suspicion
in the Internal Revenue Service that there is a tax liability
involved here.

Cash dealings of this magnitude are

unusual and in this context —
QUESTION:

But for all anybody knov/s, the cash —-

well, cash dealings of this magnitude, they may be unusual.

16
I suppose they are.

It doesn’t mean that a person did not

pay taxes.
MR. SMITH:

Indeed, it doesn't.

But our point

simply is that Congress has given the Internal Revenue
Service the power to ascertain the identity of such a
person and then to determine whether he has, In fact — it
is quite possible -QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, that means anybody, doesn’t it?
It does.

It indeed means anybody.

That means anybody on suspicion or

even on —
MR. SMITH:

I think that is right.

I think that

Mr. Justice Harlan, in setting forth the criteria in the
Powell case under which an Internal Revenue Service summons
could be issued said, "One of the purposes —" and there
were four, "was that the Investigation must be conducted
pursuant to a legitimate purpose."

And the second test

that he used was whether the inquiry was relevant to that
purpose.
I think under these circumstances, the Internal
Revenue Service’s desire to ascertain the identity of the
depositor in this case under these circumstances is a
legitimate inquiry and that is a legitimate investigation
and that the Inquiry as to ascertain his identity Is
relevant to that purpose.

17
QUESTION:

And after you found his identity, then

you might check his tax return and see whether he had been
returning it?
MR. SMITH:

Indeed, we would do so.

And that,

essentially, all of those acts would fall quite well within
the statutory purposes here.

I think that it would unduly

cripple the Internal Revenue Service’s pox^er to ascertain
the tax liability of any person if the rule in this case,
promulgated by the Court of Appeals, that first the identity
of the person has to be ascertained were the law here.
I think that the Internal Revenue Service has a
broader power to —- under these statutes —■ to ascertain
the identity of the person under investigation.
Indeed, the depositor here is a particularized
person or persons.
Now, what the Respondent has said here essentially
is in support of the Court of Appeals test that no parti­
cular taxpayer is under investigation.
Now, in an Amicus brief filed by the American
Banker’s Association, they, in facing these broad statutory
purposes of Section 7601 and 7602 say simply that with
respect to the statutory phrase, "Determining the liability
of any person for any Internal Revenue tax," they would
impose loss on that person.

They would say that the

Internal REvenue Service either had to have the name of the

18
person or some evidence of liability.
Now, we say, with respect to the first — their
first test, we think that is answered by the fact that we
have a particularized deposit in there.
With respect to whether the Internal Revenue
Service has some evidence of liability, we would submit
that that would resurrect the very probable cause require­
ment which the Court firmly rejected in Powell.
The Internal Revenue Service is not bound by any
probable cause requirement in issuing a summons.

All that It

need have is an official suspicion and, indeed, under these
circumstances, the suspicions are amply justified by the
transactions that occurred in this case, not only the
magnitude of the money involved, but the fact that money
was found in a rather unusual condition which suggested a
long period of storage.
People do not usually keep money in an airless
place unless they are hiding It for some reason and we think
under these circumstances the Internal Revenue Service had
ample justification to seek the identity of the depositor
here.
QUESTION:

Is the Bank required to keep the

numbers of bills over certain denominations when they are
deposited, under any provision of the Code?
MR. SMITH:

To keep the currency itself, or the

19-20
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

The serial —
Oh, the serial numbers.

No, I am not

aware of any provision in the Code that requires that.

But

there are, of course, reporting requirements, Federal
Reserve reporting requirements that Xtfere involved here,
which is how the Internal Revenue Service picked this
transaction up.
QUESTION:

Does that include reporting the serial

MR. SMITH:

I don’t think so because, Mr. Chief

numbers?

Justice, If you look at page l6 of the record Appendix, you
can see the copy of the report of the currency transaction
that was filed by the Federal Reserve Bank in this case.
It simply talks about "amount of denominations of
$100 or higher," and you can see in the third column of that
in the middle of the page, here are these two instances
within ten days of the deposit of $20,000 in hundreds and
there is a notation, "Hundred’s in deteriorated condition,
apparently from long period of storage,” and there is a bank
and the name of the bank, the Federal Reserve Bank, is at the
bottom and the name of the depositor bank is at the top.
Now, we think it is absolutely clear on the basis
of Powell that there is no probable cause requirement that
binds the service.

Indeed, the court analogized the power

of the Internal Revenue Service in this case, the power to

21
the Inquisitorial power of a grand jury and, surely, the
grand jury can sit in and investigate an entire industry
for a particular period of time and look in and call people
before it to offer testimony with respect to the subject
matter’ of the investigation.
Now, we set forth in our brief what we think is
rather strong legislative history in support of this
statutory argument that the Internal REvenue Service has
this power.
In 195^ at the time of the codification of the
present tax law, the summons power and the canvass power
represented an amalgamation of three different provisions
which were in the 1939 Code and wThich, In turn, date back to
statutes going back as far as 1864.
Now, the particular statute which we think is
relevant to Section 3654-A of the 1939 which similarly talks
about the Internal REvenue Service’s power to look into and
to ensure that the tax laws are being faithfully obeyed and.
that the collector had this power.

And we think it is not

without significance that in 1878 when Congress was debating
the very — sort of procedural question as to whether to
transfer the or to accord the summons poivers that were held
by collectors to agents in the Internal Revenue Service, the
debates made a reference to an incident where the Internal
Revenue Service served a summons upon a railroad in order to

22
ascertain the identity of the shipper of liquor which was
believed to have been shipped untaxed and the railroad
complied with that provision, with that summons, and it
offered up its books of account in connection with that
inquiry.
Of course, there was no income tax in 1878, but
there were excise taxes on liquor and we think that Congress
was well-aware of the fact

that it accorded this power to

the Internal Revenue Service to ascertain the identities of
persons.
Now, we think further that this legislative
understanding which was almost 100 years ago — occurred
almost 100 years ago, is also reflected in the decisions of
the lower court.
Indeed, apart from this case and the Humble Oil
Case which is presently pending on the Government's
petition for writ of certiorari and which I would imagine
the Court is holding in connection with the disposition
of this case, the circuits have pretty well uniformly given
the Internal REvenue Service the power to ascertain the
identities of unknown persons.
One of the prime examples of this pov;er is in
connection with tax return preparers.

Pour circuits have

held that tax return preparers must, under compulsion of
Internal Revenue summons, issue -- give over to the Internal

23
Revenue Service the names and social security numbers of
their clients when the Internal Revenue Service has reason
to believe that the preparer has filed returns which may not
be completely accurate.
I think if the Court has no further questions, I
would like to save the remaining time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Smith.

Mr. Watson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. WATSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RICHARD V. BISCEGLIA
MR. WATSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I would like to respond briefly to some of the
remarks made by counsel.
He uses, repeatedly in his argument, the term
"depositor" and "this depositor."

He mentions the person

who may be liable for unpaid taxes and there is nothing in
this record that says in the first place that this money
came to this bank from a depositor.
We don't know where it came from.

I make such a

distinction in my brief between customer who may bring in a
cash exchange and a depositor.
QUESTION:

You mean the bank does not know where

the money came from?
MR. WATSON:

Not to my knowledge but I am making a

24
distinction here as to the possibility that it came in off
the street as a cash exchange, in which instance the record
reflects that there is no way of identifying the source.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Watson, looking at this page

16, the report to the Federal Reserve at the right, there
seems to be a column where it is supposed to be indicated
whether a deposit, withdrawal/exchange of currency, cashing
or purchase of check — is that right?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

You are referring now to ■—
I am looking at page 16 in the report

to the Federal Reserve,
MR. WATSON:

TCR 1?

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. WATSON:

That form was not utilized in this

instance, as the record shows.

When this money went to the

Federal Reserve in November —QUESTION:

This was not used?

I thought Mr. Smith

told us this was the report by which the Internal Revenue
came upon this transaction.
MR. WATSON:

No, the way the Internal Revenue

Service came upon it was simply an employee in the Federal
Reserve Bank in Cincinnati noticed the condition and, based
upon an earlier experience where some old money had come
through which they in some way had determined had been

25
buried in concrete, his suspicions were again aroused on
this transaction and the IRS was verbally notified,
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

Was this ever used?
The TCR 1 was never filed by the

bank concerning this transaction.
QUESTION:

That is, just the form.

Who wrote up the detail here showing

November 6th, 1970, $54,600 — $20,000 in $100 bills?
MR. WATSON:

Well, now, that is the report compiled

by the Federal Reserve people, I presume, your Honor, which
describes the entire shipment if I am correct about that.
QUESTION:

That is the report from the bank to

the Federal Reserve and that doesn’t indicate at all that it
was a depositor of the bank.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

That is your point. Isn't it?

Yes.
Mr. Watson, if you don't know where the

money came from or anything, what are you worried about?
MR. WATSON:

Well, sir, we have, of course, the

basic question of whether the IRS can use a summons under
these facts.

Do they have this unlimited authority?

QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

Well, how are you hurt by that?
Well, we, of course, are involved

with confidential relationship of banks with its customers.
That is the underlying concern of the facts.
QUESTION:

Well, you said it might have come in

off the street and somebody changed it, or something like

26
that.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Theoretically, yes, sir.
Well, if that had happened, how would

the bank be responsible for anything there?
MR. WATSON:

Well, it means that the bank can

disclose all of these records, however many depositors’
records may be involved.
QUESTION:

Well, do you keep a record :fhen you

change money?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:
and changed money.

No, sir.
Well, so you would say this came in

We don’t know who did it.

MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

That is right.
And you have no problem at all.
But we don't want the IRS to rummage

through records of people who are not involved.
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

You don’t want them to ask any questions
Sir?
You don’t want them to ask any

questions.
MR. WATSON:

Well, not so much asking questions

of the bank, but of taking the records, let’s say, of a
half-a-dozen or a dozen or however many depositors we may
fit in the category of the summons as narrowed by the
court and subject innocent depositors to --

27
QUESTION"

Invasion of privacy.

MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

The invasion of their privacy.
Mr. Watson* does the record here show

I don't recall —• how many customers did enter Into this
category you described —
MR. WATSON:

No* sir.

QUESTION: — in
MR. WATSON:

this one month.

No* sir.

QUESTION:

It does not show that.

QUESTION:

But may I get back to the statement

in Petitioner’s Trial Exhibit 1?
this report is.

I am confused about what

Who prepared it. your client or the

Federal Reserve Bank?
MR. WATSON:

My understanding of that, sir, is

that that is prepared by the bank, the Federal Reserve Bank
It just shows how much money came In in those two shipments
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Cash.
In cash.

But actually —

Well, who is supposed to fill in,

under "nature of transaction," whether it is a deposit, a
withdrawal/exchange of currency, cashing or purchasing of
check?

Who is supposed to fill that in?
MR. WATSON:

Well, the bank was, the Commercial

Bank, the local bank, was supposed to provide that infor­
mation.

It was not done In this instance.

I don't know

28
that the record reflects, but it is ray understanding that
it vras routinely not done, in all transactions.
QUESTION:

What Is the purpose of having the form,

then?
MR. WATSON:

Well, the purpose was rather obvious,

to comply with the existing regulation, which requires the
reporting of these currency transactions.
QUESTION:

Reporting by whom?

MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

This was not enforced.
Reporting by your client?

MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:
client?

Yes, sir.
Well, then, is this a report by your

You have been telling us it was something prepared

by the Federal Reserve.
MR. WATSON:

It is the Petitioner’s trial exhibit

number 1 and, as I understand it, that was prepared by the
Federal Reserve Bank in Cincinnati.
QUESTION:

Well, what does your client prepare in

the way of a report?
MR. WATSON:

They have the TCR I form which was

supposed to be prepared by them but which was not prepared
by them.
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

Where is that?

Is that form here?

I am sure it Is set forth in the

record somewhere, your Honor, but I could not put my finp;er

29
right on it.
QUESTION:

Well,

if they didn’t prepare it, as

they are required to prepare it, what explanation are you
prepared to offer, or what hypothesis would you suggest?
MR. WATSON:

Well, I could only say that it is

my Information that it was routinely not observed and the
and likewise, by the Federal Reserve, they did not routinely
require it to be observed.
QUESTION:

And then the Internal Revenue comes in

and indicates that they would like to have that requirement
complied with.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Well —
That is your case.

MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:
MR, WATSON:

Sir?
And that Is your case.
I am not sure I understand in what

context you have asked the question, Judge, when you say
that is our case.
QUESTION:

Well, you are not -- you don’t want to

supply It because of the reasons stated in your argument.
MR. WATSON:

Yes, and presumably, that may be why

the bank did not provide the information on the form.

The

record does not reflect precisely the reasons why it was
not supplied in the first place.
QUESTION:

This apparently was not --

Well, is this form called for by some

30

statute or regulation of the Federal Reserve or —
MR. WATSON:

There was a Treasury regulation in

effect which is mentioned in the footnote in the Sixth
Circuit’s opinion.
QUESTION:

It is 31 Code of Federal Government

Regulations, 102.
MR. WATSON:

That has been in effect, apparently,

since around 1959, according to that footnote, but there
were no sanctions involved, as I understand it.

There are

sanctions under the present domestic currency reporting
requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act which this Court took
up last time.
QUESTION:

How large a bank Is this?

Do you know

what its footings are?
MR. WATSON:

In terms of total assets, around

$18 million.
QUESTION:

Seven tellers, I think the record tells

us, something like this.
MR. WATSON:

At the main branch, you have about

three — two at the other branch.

I'd say six or seven

would be correct, ^^es, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, if these bills came in off the

street, I take it the record indicates that it was a most
unusual street day or period because this is the only time,
apparently, they have had this kind of deposit.

31
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It surely would not be unusual for

somebody to bring in $40,000 in hundreds within a two—week
period and want to change, would it?
MR. WATSON:
brought it In

Presuming that a single individual

in a single amount, yes, I think your Honor

would be correct and I think the record shows that perhaps
Mr. Bisceglia answered that affirmatively.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you don’t have to make

that presumption, at any time ~
MR. WATSON:

I don't know of any presumption along

those lines, sir, and, in fact, I don’t know of any pre­
sumption that old money is tainted money.
This is the basis of the Government's suspicion,
but people do keep money.
places.

They keep it long times in odd

It doesn't mean that when they finally bring it In

that it necessarily represents a fraud on the IRS or any
other type of crime.
QUESTION:

Does the Government have to meet a

burden of shotting that it is tainted in order to make an
inquiry under 7602?
MR. WATSON:

I would think that they must have

some strong reason for indulging the authority and I think
that they must act within the authority of the statute.
They say that this is enough to justify their

32
actions here.
QUESTION:

Well, aren't there a lot of IRS

activities that are practiced and sustained which don’t
involve any taint?

That is, let me give an illustration.

A taxpayer was consistently reporting, taking deductions
for $40,000 of interest payments out each year on an income
of $50,000.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Wouldn’t you think that would reason­

ably allow some inquiry?
MR, WATSON:

That would warrant inquiry, I would

think so, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

There doesn’t have to be any taint,

does there?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

True.
He might be just

overloaded with

debts.
MR. WATSON:

There are some like that.

in that instance, you have the taxpayer.

we could use the example of a man who sells new automobiles.
He sells Cadillac cars.

"You must sell to a lot of people with a lot of money.
want to see all your records.

I’m not investigating

I

33
anybody, I am just curious.”
Now, what is the limit on official curiosity?
QUESTION:

Mr. Watson, does the record show

whether these were the old-fashioned big bills or not?
MR. WATSON:

It does not, to my knowledge, sirs

just that they were old, deteriorated $100 bills.
QUESTION:

It must have been hard for the tellers

to count if it was hard for the Federal Reserve people to
c ount.
MR. WATSON:

Presumably so.

Of course, the district judge, as you know from
the record, suggested that the agent was making a mountain
out of a molehill here, that there was an easier way,
procedurally, anyway, to get to this and that was to summons
the head teller, who is Mrs. Dorothy Sufferidge and, in
fact, the record shows that Agent Brutscher talked to her
and she could not recollect at the time and suggested per­
haps the records perhaps might refresh her recollection.
She was never summonsed, either by summons or by
supoenae.

Of course, we get into another can of worms if

she had been and what might have happened then, but it was
the district court's thinking that in any bank he had ever
been in, the teller would remember without the necessity of
invading all these records.
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Watson, I am looking at

34
Judge MeCree's opinion, footnote 1 at page 9-a of the
Government's petition in which this sentence appears.
"It does appear, however, that this regulation —"
that is, Regulation 102, "required the

Commercial Bank in

this case to file a form TCR-l in which, of course, the
Information sought by the IRS in this proceeding would have
been disclosed,"
Does that mean that had Commercial complied with
the regulation, the name of the depositor would have
appeared in the TCR--1?
MR. WATSON:

I think so, if it was a deposit and

they had furnished that information, it would have been
there.
QUESTION:

And I gather that what you are telling

us is that the Commercial Bank did not comply with the
regulation.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Because there was no compulsion upon

them to comply?
MR. WATSON:

Now, that is as I understand it.

Now, again, that is not precisely stated in the record, but
that is the Information that I have,
QUESTION:

May that have been changed by the

Currency Act of 1970?
MR. WATSON:

Oh, I think so because under the

35
Currency Act. you not only have the requirement of
reporting domestic transactions of $10,000, but you also
have some actions whereby the Secretary-Treasurer does not
report it.
QUESTION:

So if this case ttfould arise after the

1970 law, we would not be here with it?

You would have

reported it.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

I would think so, yes.
Unless you said the regulation xvas

invalid on the same basis you say the subpoena is.
MR. WATSON:

Yes, unless it were challenged on

some appropriate ground.
Of course, the Currency Reporting Act talks in
terms of $10,000 currency transactions.

Again, we don’t

know in what —
QUESTION:

Incidentally, I've had answered the

question I first put to you, who prepared the Petitioner's
trial exhibit 1.

According to Judge McCree, it was, as you

suggested, prepared by the Cincinnati Branch of the Federal
Reserve.
MR. WATSON:

Yes, sir.

Of course, the Sixth Circuit decided this case, as
you know, simply on the basis that those four requirements
set forth in 7602 did not apply here.

They did not reach

the constitutional or the philosophical issue, if you will.

36
They simply said that you had to have the taxpayer at least
identifiable, if not by name as an existing taxpayer or, in
the case of the tax preparer cases upon which the United
States relies, there was known to be taxpayers whose returns
had been prepared by those people and the Government wanted
to check them.
Now, every circuit court and district court which
has talked about Blsceglia since its rendition has dis­
tinguished Bisceglia on the facts from all of these other
cases.

I don't know of a single authority for the Govern­

ment’s position here on these facts.
QUESTION:

Does the second phrase of 7602 have

a rather broad sweep"for the purpose of making a return
where none has been made?"
Nov;, doesn’t that suggest that it is a rather wideranging authority in the IRS?
MR. WATSON:

I don’t give it that broad an.

interpretation, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think it is implicit

in that phrase as in the others that you know a taxpayer
exists.

You know or have reason to believe he has not made

a return and you are going to make one for him which, of
course, the IRS has the authority
QUESTION:

to do.

Well, aren't there some reasonable

presumptions that should be indulged in that people making
deposits of this amount might conceivably have some tax

37
liabilities?
MR. WATSON:
think so.

I don't think so.

I really don’t

Even if it is old money, I don’t think that

presumption arises.
QUESTION:

Your position is, as I understand it,

that the Internal Revenue Service under the statute in the
regulation had no authority whatsoever to ask the bank any­
thing unless it knows the name of the taxpayer and the
breadth of the subpoena has nothing to do with it.
MR. WATSON:

Not unless it knows the name of the

taxpayer.
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:
there is a taxpayer.
just to

That is what I mean.
But, certainly, they must know that
I don’t think the IRS has the authority

browse.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no browsing here if —

let’s assume that within that subpoena there could only be
one person.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

We can’t assume that, your Honor.
Let’s just assume it for the moment.
All right.
Wouldn’t you still be taking the same

position?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

I would be, yes.
Yes.

So It isn’t a browsing problem

38
at all.

It is just your assertion that — that unless the

Internal Revenue Service either knows the name of the tax­
payer or knows a tax is owing, it hasn’t any business
issuing subpoenas.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

It has no business in the records.
Supposing the IRS asks the question

of the bank, we’d like the name and address of the man who
deposited $102,000 in your bank at 3:30 yesterday afternoon?
Would you —
MR. WATSON:

I don’t think that is any of their

business.
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

You don’t?
No, sir.
Why not.
That is invading a private trans­

action for no lawful purpose, absent —
QUESTION:

Well, Isn't auditing of income tax

return invading the privacy?
MR. WATSON:

Not under the statutes, I don’t

believe, sir.
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

Well, they do it every day.
They do it every day and they would

certainly do it to every customer this bank has that fits
in this category if they were disclosed.
QUESTION:

Well, if they came to you and said, we

39
are investigating the tax. returns of Joe Bloke and we’d like
to see the returns, would you give then to him?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

If I am the preparer of his returns?
No, sir.

You are the bank.

Now, "We

are investigating Joe Bloke and we want his bank statement."
MR. WATSON:
have it.

0hs I think they are entitled to

They —
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

Is that an invasion of privacy?
Well, sir, it may go farther than I

would go if I wrote the statute, but they have the statutory
authority and I think that this Court has held in Donaldson
and some other cases that they can seize the records of
third parties and that there is no abuse under the self­
incrimination or unreasonable search and seizure per se on
that basis.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Mr. Watson, if we disagree with the

Court of Appeals on the interpretation of these statutes,
xtfhat do we do about the constitutional question that you
raised and that the Sixth Circuit didn't reach?

A.s I under­

stand it, the only question you raised was the Fourth
Amendment prohibition, wasn’t it?
MR. WATSON:

Yes.

Then that question must be

faced, if this Court feels that —
QUESTION:

You don't

think we have already

40
decided that in some of these other cases?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Not on these facts.
So what would you have us do, decide

the Fourth Amendment question here or send it back to the
Sixth Circuit to decide it first?
MR. WATSON:

I would be just as happy that the

Court affirm the Sixth Circuit on the basis —QUESTION:

I know, but supposing we don’t.

Suppose we disagree with the Sixth Circuit on the inter­
pretation of these statutes?
MR. WATSON:

Well, the Court could, of course,

remand for that purpose, but — and I think that would be
just as satisfactory with me but I
solid on that issue.
QUESTION:
MR, WATSON:

believe our ground is

I think that this does —
I know you do,
This does go far, far beyond any

reasonable seeking of corporate records and, of course,
this Court suggested in the California Bankers case, a
corporate entity does not have an absolute right, an
unqualified right to conduct its affairs in secrecy or
privacy but that it does have some privileges In that
regard and perhaps If the Court gets into the constitu­
tional question, it will have to decide what those limits
are.
QUESTION:

Your client has no stake here except

41
an obligation you feel to protect the privacy of

your own

customer's transaction?
MR. WATSON:

Yes, sir, the confidentiality of

the records.
QUESTION:

Was the decision below pre or post this

Court's bank cases last term?
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

It was before, I believe.
It was before.

And was there a

petition for rehearing that came after or not?
MR. WATSON:

Yes, the petition for rehearing I

think came also before the California Banker's case.
QUESTION:
MR. WATSON:

Before.

And it xuas disposed of before.

I believe I am correct on that.

I

may be — this Sixth Circuit decision was decided October
18, 1973.
QUESTION:

Mr. Watson, the record indicates the

petition for rehearing was denied November 16, '73*
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Yes. sir, I think that is correct.
So that would be before the Bank cases,

too.
MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So there was no further petition for

rehearing.
MR. WATSON:
I'll close

If this Court has no further question^

HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you. Mr. Watson.

Mr. SmithREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.
MR. SMITH:

I just want to — I think the Court

is clear on this point and that is this form TCR-1.

I just

want to clarify it.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Oh, I misunderstood you.

I thought —

This was — in other words, the

Commercial Bank of Middlesboro did not comply with the
requirement of the then-existing provisions of the Code of
Federal Regulations so that when the moldy money hit the
Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank, in effect,
filled out the form that the bank should have to comply.
QUESTION:

And, I gather, sent it to IRS, didn't

it?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.
Sent a copy of it.
Exactly.

Now, of course, under the

Bank Secrecy Act there are criminal sanctions for failure to
report, presumably.
QUESTION:

What do you think if we disagree with

the Sixth Circuit on the statutory construction.

What

should we do about the Constitution?
MR. SMITH:

Well, we have made reference to the

fact that we think the Fourth Amendment claim is

43
Insubstantial hera because of the District Court’s
narrowing of the summons which we think removes any claim
that we think It is unreasonable or overbroad.
QUESTION:

Of course —

That was never decided by the Sixth

Circuit, was it?
MR. SMITH:

Right, it was never decided.

Of

course, the Court has discretion to consider it as an
alternative basis to affirm, but we think that if the Court
does consider it, that there is no basis for it, but
discretion —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

But what about —
— in handling it.

We think that

would be a perfectly reasonable disposition of the case
since it is a factual matter and, while the District Court
considered the facts of the case, the Court of Appeals did
not have an opportunity to face the issue in the way it
disposed of the case.
QUESTION:

You

began to say something about

sanctions on the bank for not filing this form.
MR. SMITH:

I think that under the Bank Secrecy

Act there are criminal fines.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

That is under the new act.
Under the new act.
But at the time —
At the time, there were no sanctions

44
whatsoever.

It was a voluntary —* you know, it was an

alleged — you know, theoretically a voluntary thing but the
Federal Reserve Bank expected member banks and banks that
used the Federal Reserve facilities to make these sub­
missions .
Indeed, It is because of the kind of failure in
this case that Congress finally addressed the problem and
put some teeth in the law with respect to the reporting
requirements.
I have no further —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, thank you,

gentlemen, the case Is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:44 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
