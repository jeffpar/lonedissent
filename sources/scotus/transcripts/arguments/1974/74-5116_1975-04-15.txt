PHOCEE D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear -arguments

next In Mo. 7^-5116, Murphy against Florida.
Mr. Swlckle, you may proceed. I think, whenever-you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OB1 HARVEY S. SMICKLE, ESQ.
MR. SWICKLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two issues that are presented here for
this Court’s consideration

today, both dealing with pre-

trial publicity in a criminal matter.
The first question that is presented is whether
the jurors’ knowledge through the news media of a. defendant’
prior convictions is so inherently prejudicial that the
jury should be excused for cause or a change of venue
granted, notwithstanding those jurors’ assurances of
impartiality.
The second question which this Court has to deal
with is whether the totality of circumstances in this
particular case warranted a change of venue on behalf of
the defendant In the state court.
The pertinent facts with regard to this issue are
as follows:
On January 8th of *68, the defendant was arrested
for the commission of an armed robbery in Dade County,

Miami Beach, Florida.

During the pretrial proceedings of

that case, he filed a motion for change of venue as well
as a plea of not guilty and. a 9is a of not guilty by reason
of insantity.
While this particular ease was pending — and that
case number in that first ease was 68530 — the Defendant
was indicted in the Broward County, which is a northern
county directly north of Dade County and charged with the
crime of first degree murder.
Those cases gained notoriety in the news in Dade
and Broward County known as the Whisky Creek murder eases.
After that case, he was also indicted in federal
court with regards to transportation of stolen securities
arising out of the Whiskey Creek murder case so at one time
or another, there were three prosecutions pending against
Mr. Murphy.
In Dade County, Judge Steadman, after a lengthy
hearing, found the defendant incompetent to stand trial.
The defendant was then committed to South Florida State
Hospital.
Mr. Gersteln, the state attorney, then nul pressed
that case.
I think it is important to point out here that at
the time of the insanity ruling, there was a tremendous
outcry all the way up to the Governor's mansion and

Governor Clerk ordered an investigation into the sanity
ruling that Mr. Shevin,

who was a state senator at the time

and who is now the Attorney-General in the State of Florida,
initiated an investigation of Judge Steadman with regards
to this particular incident, all while legal proceedings
were still pending.
On March 1st of 1969* the Defendant was found
guilty of the murder case. Subsequent to the nul pressing
of the Dade County case Mr. Murphy was transferred to
Broward County.

There were legal proceedings for almost

a year and on March 1st, he was found guilty of first
degree murder.
QUESTION;

Was this at Fort Lauderdale?

MR. SWICKLL:

That would be Fort Lauderdale, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:

Does Fort Lauderdale have a large news­

paper of its own or does it have to rely on the Miami
newspapers?
MR. SWTCKLE:
Fort Lauderdale.
biggest.

There are several newspapers in

The Fort Lauderdale Jewsi -would be the

The substantial amount of publicity, however,

was from the Miami Herald and the Fort Lauderdale News.
The record in this case will show articles from
both of those newspapers as well as from the leaser
newspapers.

However, the Miami Herald is a prevalent

o
newspaper in Fort; Lauderdale and Broward County and through­
out the state, In some instances,
QUESTION;

Does It have statewide circulation?

MR. SWICKLE:

Yes, sir, to a degree.

To a lesser

degree than in the southern counties.

Five months after the Defendant was convicted on
the first degree murder case. Mr. Gerstein reinstituted the
Wofford robbery ease- under a new case number,

697464.

In December of ’69, prior to the trial — which
was almost a year prior to the trial of the Wofford case,
Mr* Murphy then entered a plea of guilty in the federal
case before Judge Eaton in Miami,
Prior to trial in the second Wofford robbery
information --QUESTION:

This is the same robbery.

MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Same robbery case, new information.

And he had been earlier held to be

incompetent to defend.
MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And did that

ruling get reversed

somewhere along the line?
MR. SWICKLE;

Somewhere along the way.

What had

happened was, when we got down to the trial proceedings,
the record will show that the Judge went to the Jury
selection, selected the Jury panel, but did not empanel

■7
impanel the jury,then held a hearing dealing with the
competency of the defendant, then found the defendant
competent to stand trial, then empaneled the jury and then
proceeded with the trial.
QUESTION:

And.this was a different judge from, the

judge who had earlier found him incompetent?
MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

No, sir, this was the same judge.

The same judge.

MR. SWICKLE:

Judge Carling Steadman was the same

judge throughout the period of time.
The judge reserved his ruling on the motion to
change venue until he had an opportunity to examine each
of the jurors.

The jurors were examined individually as

opposed to collectively, a total of approximately 78 jurors.
The record will show that 20 of these jurors were
excused for cause.
The defendant exhausted his preemptory challenges
and had requested of the court additional p.reemptory
challenges which were denied.

In each instance

the

defendant moved to excuse each juror individually and that
motion —• many of those motions were denied with particular
reference to the six jurors and the two

Itemates which

eventually did serve.
To summarize very briefly the btowledg • of these
urors, all of the jurors either knew of tiv. defendants

8
conviction for first degree murder in Broward County or
for his somewhat infamous theft of the Star of India and
DeLong Ruby in Mew York several years prior,
QUESTION:

The theft, or the alleged theft of the

Star of India Jewel from New York had occurred a good many
years before the —
MR. SWICKLE:

I believe either four or five years

prior to the trial.
QUESTION:

Back in 1964, maybe,

MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And the murder conviction had occurred

how long before the —
MR. SWICKLE:

17 months prior to the trial of

this case.
QUESTION:

17 months earlier.

MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION;

17 months.

MR. SWICKLE;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That's correct.

Mr. Swickle, I notice in Judge Atkins'

opinion, the district judge in denying habeas corpus at page
40 of the Appendix, said, "Prior to

his involvement in the

crime which was the subject of this petition, Murphy had
focused nationwide attention on himself for his role in
the 1964 theft of the Star of India sapphire."
Do you think it makes any difference in a ease

9
like this -whether the publicity corning to a defendant
about a prior conviction is involuntary on his part or
whether he has generated it
MB. SWICKLE:

himself?

I think it would make a difference.

Now, when we say that Mr. Murphy brought it upon himself,
he brought it on himself, not that he went out and spoke
to reporters.

What Judge Atkins meant there .was that' he was

arrested, he was convicted and that was a result of
publicity arising out of that case.
He didn’t go out and seek the publicity, just as
he didn't go out and seek the publicity in the murder case,
It accompanied him because of the fact that he had been
arrested and because of the nature of the theft.
QUESTION:

That is one reading you can give to

Judge Atkins, but I mean, it certainly isn't the only one,
I don't think.
MR. SWICKLE:

Well, except that there is nothing

in the record, if your Honor please, to support any other
determination.

There is nothing in the record to show that

in any of the proceedings Mr. Murphy went out and solicited
advertisements or solicited news articles about himself.
There is nothing in the record to support that
position.
position

There is evidence in the record to support the
that we take, that the news followed the crime

and was done as a matter of news reporting as opposed to

type of thing.
QUESTION:

Where did he get the name "Murph the

Himself, didn?t he?

MR. SWICKLE:

The name "Murph the Surf* originally

came from the fact that he was a surfer on Miami Beach,
QUESTION:

He liked that name, didn’t ha?

MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, sir, he likes the name,

Well, that is the name that got him

with the Star of India,
MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So he had a little.to do with It

MR. SWICKLE:

Well, this is the name that was

He didn’t publish the name, Murph the

Surf,
QUESTION:

No, he didn’t oppose it.

He enjoyed

it.
MR. SWICKLE:

Oh, I won't dispute the fact that

there was recognition —'
QUESTION:

And a day of reckoning.

MR. SWICKLE:

I don’t feel that with regard to that

recognition it is something he went out and solicited
because of the Star of India and I point out to the Court
that this question came up in the trial court with regard

11
to whether Mr. Murphy could get a fair trial in any other
county in the State of Florida and it was pointed out to
the judge that three months prior to the trial of this case,
the co-defendants* who were set for trial before Judge
Eaton in the federal interstate transportation of stolon
securities case, Judge Eaton entered an order of removal.
They want up to Pensacola* selected a jury in one
day and concluded the case in, I believe, a day and a half
and we brought this to the attention of the court indicating
that although the publicity was extremely extensive In Dade.
County and in Broward County, you could go to other counties
in this state and obtain a fair trial, as was done in the
federal case.
QUESTION:

In spite of the statewide circulation

of the Miami Herald.
MR, SWICKLE:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Jury selection

in the federal case, as was pointed out at the time of the
trial, took less than a day and the case was concluded in,
I think, two or three days, the actual trial.
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Swickle, is the essence

of your argument really that Marshall ought to be considered
as a constitutional ruling applicable to the states which,
I gather, the Court of Appeals, in disagreement with the

Third Circuit said it would not.
MR. SWICKLE:

Is that right?

Yes, sir, it is.

12

QUESTION:

Is that what the whole case Is all

about?
MR. SWICKLE:
sir.

That is the crux of the case;, yes,

My position on this is simply, one, when you look at

the case law, Marshall actually was the first case that
departed from the old ruling, both in the federal and the
state courts—
QUESTION:

There is no question Marshall was

purely supervisory, was there?
MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

It said so in the opinion —

MR. SWICKLE:
upon.

That i3 correct.

Yes, sir, and it has been ruled

There seems to be some conflict between the circuits,

the Third Circuit and the Ninth.
QUESTION:

Well, the Third Circuit said that

because of — what's the one -»• Sheppard and. Irvin versus■
Dowd —
MR. SWICKLE:

That's right.

Because of the

Interpretation of Sheppard and Irvin, versus Dona —
QUESTION:

That we had made Marshall constitutional

MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And this court below said, no, we

don't read it that way.
MR. SWICKLE:

That is correct and I would point

out additionally that — and we did argue this- in the brief

13

with regards to the Duncan versus Louisiana.

That case,

which was prior to Murphy was a ruling wherein this Court
held that the Sixth Amendment of the United States
Constitution entitles each and every individual in the state
court actions to jury trials in certain cases.
This would be one of those cases.
My argument there would be that Murphy is a subse­
quent to Duncan and that we feel that the Fifth Amendment
under Duncan now being applicable to the state, the
decisions under the Sixth Amendment — which Marshall was
and Marshall ruled that in supervisory capacity that the
defendant in that federal ease was denied a Sixth Amendment
right.
QUESTION:

Supervisory power is very different from

constitutional power.
MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I’m aware of that.

Marshall was not a Sixth Amendment

decision.
MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Well, Marshall ruled —

Marshall ruled that it was supervisory

power.
MR. SWICKLE:

That is correct and ruled that

the

defendants right to a fair trial, as guaranteed to a federal
prisoner under the Sixth Amendment, was violated because
of what came

before the Court.

Ik
Now, I am not saying that that decision made it
applicable to the states.

It didn't.

But when you read

Duncan and you read Sheppard and you read all of the other
cases that have come down, this is what has been inferred
and this v/as how I feel.
There can be nothing of a collateral nature more
prejudicial to a defendant other than the facts of the
particular case he is Involved In •— there can be nothing
of a more collateral nature Which would be prejudicial to
him —
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, Mr. Suicide,, that what

you are now arguing is that we should accept the Third
Circuit's analysis in Pur.c.an.
MR. SWICKLE:

That Is correct.

That is correct.

I think it is substantiated by the subsequent decisions —
or the prior decisions of the Court.
I would like to --- if it please the Court — to
argue some of the points that counsel has raised in his
brief at this point, since we are at the crux of the matter,
so to speak.
Counsel, of course, takes the contrary position
with regard to the decisions cited in his brief with regard
to the Ninth Circuit case saying that the Marshall was not
applicable because of Its supervisory power.

I think what

we have to do is, notwithstanding that, we still have to

look to what was — these jurors had before them to
determine, even if we don’t hold Marshall to be a
constitutional question, we still have to look and see if
the totality of circumstances in this case require a
reversal and I think when you look at what was said by
counsel with —
QUESTION:

You mean a constitutional reversal?

MR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

By totality?

MR. SWICKLE:

Totality of circumstances, yes, sir,

as separate and apart from the Marshall ruling itself.

This

is what we are talking about when we are talking about
point 2.
Now, counsel went to great lengths in his brief
to review the jurors’ statements.

He went to great extent

to say how the jurors , notwithstanding their knowledge of
Murphy’s convictions and notwithstanding their knowledge of
t he murder and notwithstanding what

they had read in the '

paper over the period of time, that they still had these
impartial — could form an impartial verdict in this
particular case.
But I think you have to look: to the statements of
the jurors and just very briefly, the first two jurors who
were selected in this particular ease, Mrs. Esher and
Mr. Collins.

lb
Mow3 I'm going to the motive and I'm going to the
nature of the testimony.

Each of them assured

the

Court

that they could — they could rule on this matter in an
impartial manner and that the statements were true and
correct because they were under oath.
just

But I would point out

very briefly that four prospective jurors who came

before end who came after, these particular jurors, had
statements somewhat contrary to what these jurors had
stated.
Mrs. Esher stated, at page 101 of the. Appendix,
that she heard some persons discussing this case in the
jury room.

This is another point I would like to bring

out.
This is the first case that I have been able to
find in all the eases that I have read, where fch.. judge
took absolutely no precautions during the jury selection.
News articles were permitted into the jury room:, news
articles which branded the defendant as a hoodlum, as a
convicted felon, as a convicted murderer.
Each of the jurors testified that they ware
permitted to read these articles, that they were permitted
to discuss this case among themselves, and we ,:ee /some of
the comments of some of the jurors who said, what won the

The consensus was,

Now, tills was the discussion - -

QUESTION:

Did you raise this point in your

Florida proceedings?

HR. SWICKLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And in your petition for habeas corpus?

MR. SWICKLE:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

All of these

points were raised in the trial court and the habeas
petitions and before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
We have Judge Steadman who, back in July of *68,
entered an order transferring the co-defendant, a removal a change of venue in the co-defendant because the judge,
citing Sheppard, said, "I did not take the necessary
precautions to protect the Interests of these defendants. '*
It comes to 1970 when these two

"Yes., we were.”

And, in fact, counsel attempts to distinguish

amazing as It may sound, but three of the jurors actually
did not know that Mr. Murphy was a convicted felon until
they got into the jury room.
When they got into the jury room and they dis­
cussed the case with the other jurors and had read the news
article, then they became aware that Mr. Murphy was a
convicted felon for the first time, and those witnesses, I
might add, two of which actually sat on the case in chief
in this particular matter.

when Mr. Mageley was asking him questions about discussions
in the jury room and he said it "made him sick to his
stomach as to what1' he had heard in the jury room, that the
jurors were saying, '‘Hang him.

He's guilty."

Nov/, this is Mr. Etheridge, who was the last
regular juror who, notwithstanding hearing all this, was
able to say on an impartial basis that he could render a
fair and impartial verdict in this case.

So you mean you don't need —• you don't

need Marshall at all?
MR. SWICKLE:

I don't need Marshall on the totality

issue because I feel that what occurred in the jury room
and what the jurors knew of the Defendant — I don't feel

that the Defendant has to show actual prejudice.
that his Inherent

prejudice shows here.

really have to reach the second question.

Mr. Rogers.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. ROGERS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ROGERS :

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented by this case that has been
stated by counsel for Petitioner is essentially whether a
state defendant's trial by jury is rendered essentially
unfair and therefore, violative of due process, when members
of that jury, have some knowledge of the defendant’s prior
criminal background and knowledge of some of the facts of
this case.
Nowa the Petitioner asserts this error at the
level of constitutional violation on the oasis that there

23

failure to excuse these jurors for cause and, in the
alternative, that his motions for change of venue were
denied.
We submit that these issues were properly decided
by the two federal courts below and that their reasoning
should be dispositive of this case.
I would submit that the reasons therefore are
rather extensive and there is no precedent that either of
these lower federal courts had for requiring disqualifica­
tion of a state juror because

he had knowledge of the

defendant’s criminal past.
It would require the elevation of this Court’s
holding in Marshall, not only to Sixth Amendment standards,
but also require that that be then enforced against the
states as an aspect of due process.
No court has expressly gone so far.
Secondly, v;e would submit that on the question of
a change of venue, the Petitioner did, in fact, receive a
fundamentally fair trial in the venue in which the crime
occurred and that was Dade County, Florida.
The jurors who actually served, the six whom
counsel mentioned just a few minutes ago, met the Court —
this Court’s standards for determining the reliability of
these juror3 in Irvin versus Dowd.
This standard is even set forth in Florida as a

24
statuto, florida statute 91303 which requires that the
Irvin v. Dovrfl standard be carried out In the Florida trial
courts.
Second, I would point out that the publicity to
which the defendant was subjected was not the kind of
publicity which the cases on which he relies and point to
were actually decided.

There is quite a disparity between

the degree of prejudice which was found in those — or I
should say, the type of facts on which those cases were
based from which a determination that prejudice was
inherent and the facts in this case,
QUESTION:

Have we ever had a case where the jurors

while waiting for the trial, all together had a trial of
their own?
MR, ROGERS:

Your Honor, I believe that that is

not —
QUESTION:
MR, ROGERS:
QUESTION?

Huh?
— the case that this record shows.
Well, he says that every juror testi­

fied that they had heard discussions in that room.
MR. ROGER'.':

Your Honor, I would respectfully

assert that there «;:e qualifications to that and that it
was not every juror who, in the jury room, was exposed to
that.

In fact, as cur brief points out, there was quite a

discrepancy between -.he jurors who were examined which

25
indicates that they were not all discussing the case.
Some of them flatly denied it.
QUESTION:

Well, by now, shouldn't you give

me

the name of one juror who didn't?
MR. ROGERS:

Yes, your Honor, Mrs. Essie Schweid

was one juror who disagreed and Mrs. Patricia Esher also.I
QUESTION:

That is two?

MR. ROGERS:

That is two.

Mrs. Essie Schweid is at page 124 of

the Appendix.
QUESTION:

Well, that is two.

MR. ROGERS:
t hem.

Well, there was a discrepancy between

Mot all of the jurors — not all of the other jurors

said they had been discussing the case.
QUESTION;

But they had heard it.

MR. ROGERS:

No, your Honor, the jurors did not

all — were not all asked the same questions and there­
fore, they did not all say they had been discussing the
case in the jury room.
Some of them said that they had heard discussions
of the case.

One man who had heard discussions —*

QUESTION:
is it?

Well, that is not normal in Florida,

I hope.
MR. ROGERS:

That the jurors discuss the case

beforehand?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ROGERS:

No, your1 Honor.

This is because this

was such an extensive voir dire that the jurors had so much
idle time.
X would point out that these jurors were examined
in camera.

They were

examined individually rather than

as a panel, which is the normal procedure.
QUESTION:

The reason

By in camera you don’t mean that all

of the panel was not in the courtroom?
You mean that each was called into the courtroom?
MR. ROGERS:

Called in individually — the jurors

were called in one by one and they were examined separately
on voir dire, which is the reason that there were so many
Jurors who were waiting and why the procedure took so much
time,
QUESTION:
MR. ROGERS:
QUESTION:
MR. ROGERS:

And not in public?
No, this was an in camera proceedings.
In the Judge’s chambers?
Oh, excuse me,

As to whether the

members of the public — this was not a sealed proceeding
but the judge did make sure that the prospective jurors
did not have the opportunity to hear the answers of the
jurors who went before them.

MR. ROGERS:

But .it was in the courtroom?
Yes, your Honor.
And there were presumedly spectators

MR. ROGERS:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct*
Umn hum.
And I would point out that the pro­

cedure which the trial judge then used was to examine these
jurors and allow counsel to examine the jurors and then
upon counsel's reaching a tentative agreement as to whether
the juror would be selected to serve, each tentative juror
was personally instructed by the trial judge at length as
to what his conduct should be while awaiting trial as to
what he should avoid reading, as to what influences he
should avoid exposing himself to.
This was repeated for each juror and representative
examples of these instructions appear at page 928 of the
'original transcript, page 866 of the original transcript,
and can be found, in fact after each of these jurors
appeared and was selected as a tentative juror.
I would also point out that publicity, since this
is deemed to be a totality of the circumstances at issue on
the second point, that the publicity had been, in effect, at
its height a year and a half to three years prior to this
trial and that in the period of six months proceeding the
trial of the cause, that the publicity was found to be
diminshing and that, in fact, there were very few articles
which surrounded this trial.

2Fj

The lower court so found.
So as far as a totality of the circumstances test,
there was no infection of the community as has

been found

to violate the requirements of this Court in Irvin versus
Dowd, in Rideau versus Louisiana ~~ there was no inherent
prejudice in the community, thereby leaving no question
but that prejudice must have infected the panel.
The court exercised its voir dire ability to
exclude those jurors from the panel who had any actual
prejudice.

The defense used up all of the

Yes, your Honor, there is no

question about

that.
Mow, that is not to say that the trial judge
refused challenges for cause but the standard which the
judge used was the standard vjrhich this Court laid down in
Irvin versus Dowd,

a juror who could reasonably apply

himself to the law and the facts and exclude any extraneous
influences.
QUESTION:

That a juror that said, what I heard

about this case made me vomit?
MR. ROGERS:
your Honor.

The full quotation is enlightening,

I don’t have the passage before me but the

reason that he said it was because he said that he had such

29
a strong adheranee to constitutional safeguards that this
concept made him sick and it was on this basis that we
submit that he had a very reasonable assurance that he gave
to the trial Judge that he would be. in fact, a qualified
juror and would not consider any extraneous Influence.

QUESTION:
MR,ROGERS:

That was Edvabsky?

Is that —?

Edvabsky, I believe is his name,

your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. ROGERS:

All right,
I have attempted to summarise our

position in this issue.

There are a few more details

which I would like to go into if I may return to the first
point and that is that it is most significant that the
.trial in this case involved a defendant

drawn not

only statewide but nationwide attention to. .himself with
some of hia previous exploits •— among these, the highlypublicised story of the Star of India Jewel theft from the
Mew York Museum of Natural History.
After his release on this and prior to the
robbery in the instant case, there i?ere two other highlysignificant crimes which he committed also in the State of
Florida and each of these crimes drew intensive publicity
a

the time but, of course, they were long prior to this

trial.

..

30
The Miami Herald, which was — it represented most
broadly In the Appendix to this case — is the leading
paper statewide; in addition to other papers which appear
in various regional parts of Florida, the Miami Herald does
have a statewide circulation.
It would have been extremely difficult to find a
panel of jurors anywhere within this state who, as a result

of the Star of India and publicity on the subsequent crime.,
would not have had some concept that these events had
transpired.

In addition, the district judge on habeas corpus
had no constitutional precedent by which he could decide
that Marshall should be the test which should have been
applied in the 3tate courts.
Marshall would serve, indeed, us poor precedent
in a case such as the one at bar.

The requirement that the

states should be controlled by Marshall would impose a
severe hardship in a situation of the notorious defendant
who would then not be able to find —• where the state, I
[sic]
should say, Would not be able to find the defendant for
such a ease probably anywhere in the state who had not
known of a conviction

for one of these prior crimes.

The extent of publicity had reached the point, I
may point out here, that there was even a movie made of
some of these exploits so the district judge, who was quite

31
justified In finding that this was a notorious defendant.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rogers, do you tie that in to the

change of venue for the other codefendants however?
MR. ROGERS;

Yes, your Honor,

I would point out

two factors regarding that change of venue on a separate
federal crime.

That is, that one, the declaration by this

defendant that he was guilty and was a codefendant with the
others would necessitate the federal judge change the
venue for that particular crime and, secondly, the ease with,
which the codefendants obtained the jury in Pensacola, a
remote part of Florida, is easily explained by the fact
that the codefendants did not have anything like the
notoriety that this defendant had so once we remove
Mr. Murphy from the four defendants, then the other three
defendants can quite easily get a jury as they have vir­
tually no notoriety and very little fame or reputation.
Mr. Murphy's name would not enter into a jurist's
consideration as to whether he could give any of the three
.codefendants a fair trial.
The requirement that the state be bound by the
Marshall doctrine would place the state in a position quite
different from the federal trial courts In that any federal
trial court doss have jurisdiction over a federal crime and
under Rule 21, a federal defendant who was so put upon
could succeed in getting his cause transferred to the most

32

remote federal district court in this- country.

The states

would be hard-pressed to have the same flexibility and,
indeed, a defendant who would be known statewide for a
particular crime

within that state could very well find

himself without a jury and there would be no possibility of
affording the man a trial at all.
That is probably the strongest reason which we
can asserts that the more flexible Irvin v. Dowd

standard

is the one that is properly applied to the states, whereas
the Marshall requirement can continue as a viable standard
for the federal judiciary.
It is just such a situation as this which prompts
the distinctions between federal and. state practice and
the distinctions, Indeed, which have been proved in Spencer
versus Texas of there being the possibility of variations
in practice between the state and federal courts.
If I may address the second point with my
remaining time, we did not have the situation in Dade
County which would qualify under any of the tests or any of
the factual patterns in Ride an versus Louisiana} Bates
versus Texas or Irvin ’versus Dowd in which it was clear
from the nature of the case, the size of the community, the
intensity and the viciousness of the publicity which
infected those small communities that it was clear that we
could have presumed that any defendant brought — that

these da fendant;
from a venerae from any community could not receive a fair
trial.
The concept that too many Jurors., too many time3
had announced their prejudice, in Irvin versus Dowd would
not find any parallel in the transcript in the instant case
The jurors who actually nerved gave quite viable
and. quite rational explanations of their impartiality and
the passage of time was not the least of these.
Clearly, although they had some knowledge prior to
the time they entered the courtroom of the defendants*
background and the defendants* prior crimes, there is no
doubt that the passage of time does din these recollections
What made matters worse as to some of these jurors
vas that the manner of examination on voir dire refreshed
ail of their recollections and, indeed, led some of the
jurors into saying that I did not know that, that was the
fact until counsel mentioned it during voir dire.
So the* passage of time certainly had dimmed the
recollection of these facts as far as many of these jurors
were concerned.

The size of the community in Dade County

also removed it from the inherent prejudice category and
places this judge as very reasonably having denied a motion
for* change of venue.

opportunity for filtering out any prejudice that may have
been latent in the community and presents a record before
this

Court which represents a reasonable basis on which to

say that the courts below are quite correct.
We submit that affirmance is warranted on these
eases because the Petitioner was afforded a full measure
of due process as that has been defined by this Court in
\
Irvin versus Dowd.
Indeed* the Irvin versus Dowd standard has been
adopted by at least 12 of the states -.chioh have had an
occasion to pass on the issue.

It would be quite surprising

to most of the state courts if the Marshall standard were
how deemed to be superimposed and required after what
appeared to have been settled precedent in. the area*
Thank you.

Mr. justice Marshall, your coveem with royaros to

heard, discussions in the jury room was not, I would say, all
the jurors,

This was the point I was trying to bring out.

I would say 70 or 60 percent of the jurors who were
actually questioned indicated that there were discussions.
What I wanted to point out is that, seeing that
the jurors who sat on the jury panel were the ones who
didn41 hear any discussions and the ones that were excused
for various reasons — either for cause or for medical
.reasons or excused by the state or excused by the defendant,
those jurors seemed to have a different view of what
transpired and I would just like to give you a quick run­
down .
Patricia Esher, who is the first juror, said she
heard one person discussing the case and that one person
had formed an opinion.
The immediate two jurors after her, Prank Gale and
R. Fleming, Mr. Cale said the majority of the prospective
jurors had formed an opinion that the defendant was guilty.
That is at page 108.
Mr. Fleming, who came immediately after Mr. Cale
said, the jurors discussing the ease stated, put him away,
throw away the key.

That was the consensus of the opinions.

The next juror who sat was Mr. Collins.

Mr. Collins,

who was able to sit and impartially listen to this case,
said no one in the jury room had formed an opinion of this

36
case.

However* the jurors both before him and after him,
referring to, again, Mr. Fleming and Mr. Perraro —
Mr. Ferraro says the discussions about Murphy — there were
discussions about his prior convictions and the jurors had
formed an opinion of guilt,
QUESTION:

MR. SWICKLE:

No, I am suggesting when we are-
