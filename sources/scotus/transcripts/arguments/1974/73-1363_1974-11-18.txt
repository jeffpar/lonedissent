MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No, 73-1363, National Labor Relations Board against
J. Weingarten.
Mr. Hardin, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK HARDIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. HARDIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case, like the one just argued, presents the
Court with the issue of whether it is an unfair labor
practice for an employer to refuse an employee's request
for the presence of her union representative at an inves­
tigatory interview which the employee reasonably believes
will lead to disciplinary action.
And I'd like to begin by pointing out that there
are no cross-petitions in this case and that the propriety
of the Labor Eoard and the Fifth Circuit determination
that the right to union representation as a part of the
right to bargain collectively arises at the point where
discipline is to be imposed, is an issue not directly
presented in this case.
We are here concerned with a different part of
the statutory rights conferred by Section'7.

Specifically,

4
they are the rights to act in concert for mutual aid or
protection.
The board has held that that grant of statutory
right which is to be distinguished from the right

to act in

concert for the purpose of collective bargainings does grant
to the employee the right to be represented at an investi­
gatory interview.
I am going to state the facts of — excuse me.
QUESTION:

Mr. IIardin5 it has to be -

you have to

say this involves engaging in concerted activities.
HR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:
HR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Yes,

There must be —

Not just act in concert but —
— concerted activities.
— the statute 3ays, "Engage in other

concerted activities."
■-

HR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:
arguably.

That’s correct.
Now, that’s a little different,

In other words, If you are going to rely on the

statutory language, I think It is quite Important that we
keep our eye on what the statutory language is.
MR. HARDIN:
right.

You are quite right.

You are quite

It must be concerted activity and the Labor Board,

of course, has found that when one employee stretches a
hand to the other to seek that mutual aid, they are
engaged in concerted activity or are seeking to do so, a

5
right which the board can protect.
I think that a statement of the facts will help
to illustrate for the Court very clearly the value to the
employee of the right which the board has recognized in
this case, as it did in Quality.
J. V/eingarten Company operates a chain of about
100 retail stores in the Houston, Texas area.
large

Like most

retail and distribution enterprises, it maintains a

centralized security apparatus, one of the purposes of
which is to investigate suspected employee theft.
Leura Collins is an employee of J. Weingarten
and has been employed since 1961 in a number of stores
working lunch counters or in the lobby departments, a more
sophisticated prepared food take-out arrangement.
In June of 1972, Mrs. Collins was working at
store Number 98 and in June of 1972, information came to
the company’s attention which suggested that Mrs. Collins
was engaged in dishonest activities.
The record does not disclose either the soui’ce
or the nature of that information.
The company reacted to it by dispatching one of
its Loss Prevention Specialists, Mr. Hardy, to conduct an
investigation and on June 15, 1972, Mr. Hardy began two
days of plainclothes surveillance of the operation of the
lobby department of Store Number 98.

6
He saw nothing which indicated any evidence of
wrongdoing by the employees and on the third morning, which
would have been the 18th, he introduced himself to the store
manager at Store Number 98, Mr. York.

The

two had not

previously known one another and the Loss Prevention
Specialist identified himself as a member of the Central
Security Bureau of the employer’s operation.
He reported that he had conducted an investigation
in the lobby department and had found no evidence of any
employee dishonesty.
The manager responded by saying, "Why, just this
very morning, another employee in the lobby department
-f.\

,'.'r

reported to me that yesterday Mrs. Collins took a $3 box
of fried chicken from the lobby department and put only a
dollar in the till."

v

Well, the Loss Prevention Specialist decided to
check that out.

He summoned the employee who had so reported

to the .manager., a Mrs. Moody,- and he interrogated her about
the allegation that Mrs. Collins had stolen $2 worth of
chicken the day before.
Mrs. Moody confirmed the story and then
Mrs. Collins was.summoned to an area near the manager’s
office.

There she was confronted with the Loss Prevention

Specialist from headquarters, who began to interrogate her
about general acts of dishonesty.

7
Mrs. Collings asked if she could have the
assistance or presence of her union representative and the
store manager said, "No, this is a private matter between
you and the company."
With respect to the questioning about the box of
chicken on the preceding day, Mrs. Collins stated, 'We had
been out of small boxes, so I took a small, $1 quantity of
chicken, put it in a larger box, paid $1 for it and left
the store."
The loss prevention specialist went to check this
out and he determined that, in fact, the store had been
out of smaller boxes on the preceding day and that the
employee who had reported on Mrs. Collins didn’t know how
much chicken she had put in the large box.
He went back to the interview and said the inter­
view had terminated.

Her story checks, out.

At that point, Mrs. Collins became very emotional
and began to cry, probably tears of relief, but at any rate,
in her relief she says, "I've worked for Weingarten's for
11 years and I've never taken anything that I haven't paid
for except the free lunches."
The loss prevention specialist and the manager
professed to be astonished that anyone was getting free
lunches at Weingarten's and they Immediately resumed the
interrogation.

8
QUESTION:
specialist?"

Well, what is this "loss prevention

That is certainly a high-sounding title.

MR. HARDIN:

That is the company's terminology,

your Honor.
The — Mrs. Collins again asked for the assistance
of her union representative.

She insisted that she had

taken lunches because it was the practice of all the emp­
loyees, Including the lobby department manager, to do so
and she indicated that she would not sign a statement which
the loss prevention specialist was then typing by which she
was to acknowledge a debt to the company of $l60 for lunches
xtfhich she shouldn't have eaten.
The loss prevention specialist then made some

further inquiries and discovered that no one' at company

QUESTION:

At the previous store, there clearly

had been a policy.
MR. HARDIN:

There clearly had been, at the lunch

counter, at the previous ■—
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

Store Number 2 or whatever It was.
That’s right, Store Number 2.

When

she had transferred to Store Number 98 the company apparently
had thought that she and all employees had been Instructed
that there would be no free lunch, but there is no evidence

9
in the record —
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

In the lobby-type store.
That’s right.

The record does not

disclose affirmatively that such instructions wver were
given and it does show that all of the employees in the
lobby departments including an employee titled "Lobby
Department Manager" were taking free lunch every day that
they worked.
The interview was terminated.

Later in the after­

noon, the manager discovered that, in fact, all the employees
in the lobby were getting free lunches and he — the next
day, issued an order directing that it be stopped.
Meanwhile, he sent Mrs. Collins home, gave her
the afternoon off because she was so distraught, and asked
that she not discuss the interview with anyone.
Well, she discussed it with the union represen­
tative, and that led to the filing of the charge with the
National Labor Relations Board and the General Counsel
issued a complaint against the company alleging specifically
that the company had denied Mrs. Collins’ request for the
assistance of a union representative during these inter­
views and that the denial was a violation of Section 8(a)(1).
QUESTION:

Nothing more ever happened to

Mrs. Collins.
MR. HARDIN:

That is correct.

10

QUESTION:

She came back to work?

MR. HARDIN:

She returned to work.

She was paid,

ultimately, for the four hours she had taken off the
preceding afternoon and as far as the record discloses, I
think that she is still working there.
QUESTION:

And so what was the board’s order?

There was no reinstatement order necessary.
MR. HARDIN:

No, of course not.

Nor was there In

the Mobil Oil case which has been discussed this morning.
It is a direction to the company to cease and desist —
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

Right.
— from interrogating employees unless

they are accorded the right to have the assistance of a
union representative.
QUESTION:

Is there any — the facts, because of

what you have just told us, sir, are a little less — a
little more mild in this case than in the previous one, but
v';*

is the issue an identical issue?

-'i

,i

Is there any difference

at all?
MR. HARDIN:

It is identical in this case to the

situation that the woman in Quality had been in who was
asking for the assistance of her union representative.
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

You also have there the representatives
The representatives themselves being

disciplined for their efforts to provide representation.

11

QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

But it is essentially the same issue.
It is the same issue.

It is

precisely the same issue.
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

Precisely the same.
That is correct.

The board adopted the decision of its adminis­
trative

law judge which applied the then-recent Quality

Manufacturing decision and found that there had been
concerted activity for the purpose of mutual aid and
protection and then addressed the question whether
Mrs. Collins' fears that the Interview might lead to
discipline were reasonably based In all the circumstances.
The decision takes particular note of the fact
that these events occurred In the retail industry and that
Weingarten, in common with most members of that Industry,
most employers in that Industry, regard employee dishonesty,
where proved to the employer's satisfaction, to be an
unpardonable offense, the discipline

for which ordinarily

Is discharge unless there are exceptional mitigating
circumstances.
With that in mind and because the contract here
provided that the usual system of warning notices was not
available to an employee who was deemed guilty of theft
to the employer's satisfaction, the law judge concluded that
Mrs. Collins' manifest fears had, indeed, been reasonably

12
grounded In objective circumstances and that she was entitled
either to have the assistance of her union representative at
that Interview or to have the company terminate the interview
and forego the benefit of what information it might get from
interrogating her.
The Fifth Circuit refused to enforce the order of
the board.

It noted first an apparent conflict or Incon­

sistency between the result in this case and the result
which that court had disapproved in the earlier Texaco
decision.

It noted the apparent inconsistency between the

results here and its own earlier Texaco decision but then,
coming directly to grips with the board's rationale In this
case, that is, the proposition that the language of Section
7 Itself confers the right, the court rejected that
rationale, apparently — and the opinion is riot entirely
v :

clear — but, apparently, not because it regarded Its own
earlier decisions as controlling,,but because it disagreed
with the board about the need to extend that kind of pro­
tection to employees.
The court says, and this Is on page 7a of our
petition for certiorari in this case, the court says, "While
a basic purpose of Section 7 Is to allow employees to engage
in concerted activities for their mutual aid and protection,
such a need does not arise at an investigatory interview.

To

extend the scope of the act’s protection to such preliminary

13

contacts between an employee and his employer would be to
apply an overbroad interpretation of Section 7

without

explanation as to why or direct explanation as to why it
regarded the protections as unneded and the construction of
the statute which the board had settled on as being over­
broad. "
Now, the decision of the Fifth Circuit is
defended in this Court basically upon two grounds.

First,

there is the argument that the right conferred cannot be
logically found within the confines of the statute itself
and, secondly, it is argued that the board decision is
basically unwise, or that the costs of securing these
employee rights will be so far outweighed by the -

the

advantages of securing these employee rights will be so
far outweighed by the costs to the employers that it is
unwise to grant them in the first instance.
A variant on that last argument is that the
board hasn’t really clearly told us it made that balance and
so you can’t affirm it even if it is the right balance.
QUESTION:

Do you think that at such an interview

as this, preliminary interview where you do not concede the
right to have a friend there, that the employee could make
statements that would be Incriminating?
I am now distinguishing your case as not part of
the state.

It Is not a governmental operation.

V\
MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Incriminating literally, you mean?
Yes.

MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

It certainly is possible —
In the Fifth Amendment sense.

MR. HARDIN:

Yes.

It is not only possible, it Is

fairly common for an employee, caught in the toils of the
employer’s security

apparatus, not only to make incrimin­

ating statements, but to see them written out and then to
sign them.

But the —
QUESTION:

There is nothing undesirable about that,

though, is there, if the statements are truthful?
MR. HARDIN:

Certainly not.

Certainly not.

The

interest of the employee and the interest of the employer
are basically in harmony in such a circumstance.
Each has an interest in seeing that the truth,
whatever it is, is disclosed and In preventing overreaching
by the Interrogator which leads to confessions by employees
to events which they may or may not be guilty of but of
which they are not guilty in fact, I mean to say.
QUESTION:

Now, I take it

that you distinguish

that the situation to which you just responded from the
typical official incrimination on that ground I suggested,
that you are not part of a governmental apparatus, this is
a private contractual arrangement between an employer and an
employee and that in the traditional 3ense, the Fifth

15
Amendment protections do not reach that.
MR. HARDIN:

There is no contention whatever in

this case that the employer's actions are colored by any
state action notions whatever and the board, in its
discussion of these issues, has never cast its discussions
In constitutional terras or analyzed the issues by reference
to the decisions of this Court in the area of Fifth Amend­
ment protections.
The right which the board is seeking to protect
here springs from the statute and has been accommodated
as best the board can accommodate that right ’to the
realities of industrial life.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather that the concerted

activities, in the court of appeals view, is 'a very special
deference to board judgment as to what does constitute a
• .A

concei-ted activity..

• . > X
'"xS

MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.
Is that it?

MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, in terms of judicial review,

a board's determination of what constitutes a concerted
activity, what is the test?
MR . HARDIN:
QUESTION:

The —

Of course, I gather what the Fifth

Circuit has done here is to say — well, not too clearly,

16
that it doesn’t accept -MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Well — '
— as within a board competence, this

definition, at least.
MR. HARDIN:

I think we have to separate two things

in this discussion, your Honor.

First of all, the question

of how much deference the board’s view about the meaning of
the law entitled to.
It is entitled to great weight but it is certainlythe standard of review is not so rigorous or so confined
as It would be in the case of examination for abuse of
discretion or something of that nature.
But the second point which has to be remembered
here is that a part of the process of judging in these cases
has been the process of adapting the perceived statutory
right so that it can function In a useful Way in the real
world and it is that part of the board’s decision-making
function which is entitled to very, very great deference
in reviewing courts and here the board clearly has in its
course of decision taken a primary statutory right, a right
that, as I have stated before, is described in the disjunc­
tive from the right to bargain collectively and it has
tailored that right In an effort to permit employees to
have that mutual aid or protection at a point where it
clearly is needed — as Mrs Collins’ situation attests — but

17
it has been limited.
We are not here arguing, as Mr. Jenkins in the
last ease appeared to think, that there is an absolute right
to union representation at ail times under all circum­
stances .
The right, in the board's view, is available
first —QUESTION:

I know, then , the board isn't taking

that position, but if this all turns around the word
"concerted" and it is concerted because one employee was
holding out his hand to the other, I don't know where your
limits are when he doesn't fear discipline, it is true
investigation or it is just a conversation and he holds out
his hand to the other and he wants somebody along with him.
MR. HARDIN:

Well, that — the accommodation of

admittedly conflicting interests in that area is one —•
QUESTION:

Would you say that that probably

won't happen as long as the board sits?
MR. HARDIN:

I wasn't going to say that.

I was

going to say that the entire matrix of law that exists
under the act today is the consequence of a series of
adjustments betx^een conflicting rights of employees on the
one hand and needs of employers on the other.
QUESTION:

And I suppose you would say as to that,

in the real x-;orld, which is the board’s responsibility to

18
have in mind when it makes this kind of determination, this
is well within a board competence to —
MR. HARDIN:

Yes, and well within its province to

decide.
QUESTION:
were here

Mr. Hardin, this morning I think you

when we had this case from the Court of Appeals

in the District of Columbia circuit argued, the Truck
Drivers8 case and there, of course, the Court of Appeals
upset a determination by the board and the board

is here,

Mr. Comart is here to have it reinstated and you are here
basically in the same capacity from a different decision
this afternoon.
.

[’ A

•

Do you see any difference in the standard of
review of the board’s exercise of discretion in the case
this morning that should be applied by this Court or the
case you are arguing?
HR. HARDIN:

Any difference in the standard of

review?
QUESTION:

Yes, that the Court should apply to a

determination by the board.
MR. HARDIN:

I think the only useful distinction

is that in this morning’s case, the board was writing
against a background of considerable judicial ruling by
this Court and a number of others.
In this afternoon’s cases, Me are dealing, perhaps

19
not with a tabula rosa but with a province where the board
is still making the first pronouncements and I think that
is a factor which can legitimately affect the scope cf the
review.
QUESTION:

The fewer judicial decisions in this

area than there were in the area this morning.
MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Mr. Hardin, did you find anything in

the legislative history of Section 7 that supports your
view of it today as embracing within the phrase, "concerted
activity" the type of meetings and conferences we are
talking about?
MR. HARDIN:

No, your Honor, neither we nor any

other party has been able to take any comfort from the
legislative history in this matter.
QUESTION:
I©. HARDIN:

As you know —

Is that flat silence?
Virtually so.

As you know, the

statutory language came into the National Labor Relations
Act via the Railway Labor Act and the National Industrial
Recovery Act and its precise language received relatively
little attention from the drafters.
QUESTION:

Well, the precise language having to

do with representation appears in another part of the act,
doesn't it?
MR. HARDIN:

The precise language having to do —

20
QUESTION:

That is, the right to have union

representation or a union representative at the time of a
grievance.

That appears somewhere else in the act, doesn’t

it?
MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is in the proviso to 9(a).
The proviso to 9(a).

MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And in view of that very precise

language at the time that the Congress was focusing on those
problems, don’t you suppose that that could be argued that
is the meets and binds of what Congress intended to give by
way of representation?
MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Well, 9 —
The legislative history certainly

shows —- if I remember it and

I don’t remember it specif­

ically with respect to this problem — that Section 7 had to
do with the right to get together in a group and to
organize, first to collectively bai’gatn and, secondly, for
various other purposes but not involving, not at all
involving, not suggesting that this involved 'individual
representation at the time of an intervievr between an
employee and his employer and insofar as that is covered or
dealt with or focused upon by the Congress, you will find
that in the proviso to 9(b), won’t you?
MR. HARDIN:

The — v?ell, of course, the proviso

21
to 9(a) —
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:
the 19^7 amendments.

9(a), excuse me.
— was substantially modified during
The original version of that, if I

am correct, provided that the Individual employee was free
to present a grievance to his employer.
The modifications in 19^7 added to that the -right
to have it

adjusted so that the substantial part of the

right to deal individually with respect to grievances
was added during the 19^7 modifications to the act and at
that time, I think it is very pertinent to note that this
issue had received only the least adumbration, only one
decision from the board

had dealt in this area so far as

our research discloses and that was a case where the board
expressly pretamnitted dealing with the question of whether
an employee has an individual right to representation.
That, of course, was the Ross Gear and Tool
decision.
Well, the Seventh Circuit somewhat put the
development of the law off the track by viewing the case
as raising the issue which the board had pretermitted
but then, instead of remanding the case

so the board

could answer that question, the Seventh Circuit decided it
and probably wrongly.
At the same time that was happening, the

22
amendments to the act of 19^7 were putting the prosecution
function in the hands of the independent general counsel
and so far as we can tell from the reported general counsel’s
decisions, for the next 20 years or so, apparently in
deference to this view of the loss stated by the Seventh
Circuit in Ross Gear, the general counsel refused to issue
any complaints in cases of this sort.
So that we only return to this arena with the
issuance of the board's decision in Quality Manufacturing ,
in Texaco and at that point, the Fifth Circuit became
persuaded by the board's view that at least at the point
where discipline is to be imposed by the employer, the
employee has the right, under the collective bargaining
part of Section 7, to have the union representative present
and the union representative has the right to be there.
It disagreed with the board, however, that the
facts in that case presented an occasion where discipline
was to be imposed and treated it, instead, as being merely
an occasion where the employer intended to interrogate the
employee.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hardin, you are not contending, or

are you, that this comes under the collective bargaining
part of Section 7?
MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

No, we are not.

We are not.

Because there was a good deal of such

23
talk In the briefs, as I remember, as I read them, that
maybe in the other case —

MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Not in our brief.
Well, a week or so, when I read them.

This is not collective bargaining.
MR. HARDIN:

No, it is not collective bargaining.

You can’t have collective bargaining until you know there
is something to bargain about.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HARDIN:

And the board’s view affirms, to

some extent, at least, by the B’ifth Circuit is that some­
thing to bargain about arises, at the earliest, where the
employer calls the employee in to impose discipline.
This right —
QUESTION:

But even a grievance, even a claim

of a kind of grievance Is not generally known as collective
bargaining, is it?

It is known as something else.

MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:
MR. HARDIN:

I — I —
In any event, ttfe don’t need to —
We don’t have to reach that, but

the statutory language requires bargaining about the
meaning of an agreement during its term as Well as

about

the terms which are to be settled on the front end.
QUESTION:

The so-called "minor dispute.'1

this is not collective bargaining.

But

You are not contending

24
that.
MR. HARDIN:

We are not contending that the rights

here arise out of collective bargaining.
QUESTION:

So through a representative doesn’t

have any — that language has been applicable here.
MR. HARDIN:
QUESTION:

Right.
Could I ask you what the board’s rule

is under the proviso?

If there is a grievance and the

employee wants to adjust it by himself with the employer,
may he bring a — is he

entitled to have somebody else

come with him, even though it isn't the union?
MR. HARDIN:

Yes, although I think that Mr. Dunau

has, by reference to the Houston

decision, correctly

stated in the law that he may have the next' friend.
Of course, the union must be permitted to be
present and the union also has the statutory right to block
or at least oppose all the way to the arbitration machinery
any settlement which it regards as eohtrary to the terms of
its own collective bargaining.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Martin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEIL MARTIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF J. WEINGARTEN, INC.
MR. MARTIN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

25
In exploring upon what basis the Labor Board
now construes that Section 7 creates an affirmative right
for an employee, I believe it is interesting to look at
what the board does not cite as authority.
First of all, there is no citation or articulation
of the legislative history.

As has been stated before, the

concentration of the legislative history, both for the
Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Amendments, was directed at
the inequality of employees before their employers on the
basis of economic pressure.
It is this thrust, as Senator Wagner states in
the legislative history, that was sought to be counteran
balanced. There was sought to be an adjustment of/employe£s
and employer’s right to deal economically one with the
other.
Admittedly, Section 7 does not protect all
concerted rights and all concerted activities.

No one

would state that illegal concerted activities are protected
by Section 7.
Not every employer contact with an employee was
thought to be protected by Section 7.

We submit that,

based upon the overall view of legislative history, it is
the economic pressure that an employee was unable to exert
against his employer on an individual basis that is
considered and it is this economic pressure that should be

26

allowed to flow between parties under the statute3 Section 7.
As all have stated, there is no collective bar­
gaining in a pre-decisional fact-finding investigation.
There is no decision here that an employer who
deals with employees merely to elicit facts is circumventing
the provisions of Section 8(a)(5) of the act.
In fact, the legislative intent doe's not manifest
an employee may control the employer's avenue of gaining
information concerning his operations.
The idea of mutual aid or protection has been
discussed.

What is a dichotomy and, perhaps, anomaly, is

the fact that the board has taken the position that these
collective interests do not rise to a level sufficient to
permit the union to be present but do rise to a level to
permit the employee to institute representational assistance
if he so desires.
It is difficult for us to understand why, if the
union requests the representation,it is not permitted

and

while the employee requests it, it is.
It seems to us that the same rights would be
involved regardless of the party requesting representation.
The Labor Board has imputed or implied that an employee,
when he seeks the aid of his representative or another
employee, is engaged in protected, concerted activity.
This implies that employee is not seeking

27
self-protection or protection against questions which may
be embarrassing or particularly probing, but that he- is
seeking to, in the future, make a situation where other
employees will be accorded similar treatment.
Now, this is a factor which has not been explored
by the record, but it is imputed to an employee by the
Labor Board that when he does request that a union
representative be present, it is for concerted activity
when, in fact, it may be for self-preservation as opposed to
any effort or motivation on a concerted basis.
It has been stated that the contracts in many
major companies provide for representation of an employee
and an investigatory interview.

The fact that this is

in industrial situations today, we believe to be evidence
of the fact that the right to

bargain collectively for

the right of representation of an employee at an investigatory interview has not been diluted by the. prior position
of the board that no right existed in the context of the
fact-finding investigation.
In fact, the board has not taken the position
today that any of its prior decisions have been reversed.
In a prior case of Daton Typographic,

where the employer

sought to question employees about errors they made in
proofreading,

the trial examiner of the Labor Board found

that there was no concerted activity and the board adopted

28
that position.
Yet the board has not attempted to reverse that
decision or other decisions which have created this dichotomy
between investigatory and disciplinary reviews.
The idea that an employee is statutorily protected
from interviews by his employer presupposes

that there is

an adversary condition, that there is a situation where an
employee is immediately placed under suspicion or under
fear of adverse consequences and to permit an employee’s
speculation as to what an employer may do with the informa­
tion that he gathers is to take the employer’s unfair labor
practice completely out of his intent or purpose for an
employee may wrongly suppose that an employer's questions
may result in disciplinary action.
The case that is before this Court involves a
suspicion of theft.

The case that involved the Labor Board

decision of Texaco-Los Angeles Terminal involved the situa­
tion where an employee refused to drive a piece of equipment
which he deemed to be effective.
In that case, the trial examiner found that there
\ias no violation of the act because the employee, on one
point, had no reason to believe that his job status was in
jeopardy.

It is difficult for us, representing employers,

to determine which belief of the Labor Board is to be
followed.

Where they adopt decisions by administrative law

29
judges or trial

examiners that questions concerning

insubordination do not raise the level of reasonable fear,
whereas they say that questions concerning thefts do raise
that fear.
It has been stated that the prior —
QUESTION:

In the previous case, we had what

seemed to be an insubordination case, sassing •--- sassing
Mrs. Gerlach or whatever her name was and the board came
out the same way, saying that that created a reasonable
fear on behalf of the employee to the extent that she was
entitled to have a union representative present if she
wanted to.
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, but we understand —
So the board has, as I understand it

t ■

in these two cases, has not made the distinction that you
Just

just suggested.
MR. MARTIN:

No, the cases appear to exist co~

equally without a distinction being drawn between why one
question concerning insubordination would not raise
reasonable fear and while other questioning concerning
insubordination would raise that fear.
The test of reasonable fear of an employee has
no relationship to the realities of the circumstances.
There is no relationship between the results of the Inter­
view and whether an employee may reasonably fear that his

30

job status is in jeopardy,
QUESTION:

Do you, Mr. Martin, accept the law of

the National Labor Relations Board that at a concededly
disciplinary interview an employee has a right to a fellow
employee or a labor representative?
MR. MARTIN:

No, your Honor, I do not because

there is no statutory basis for it.

It has been created in

a situation of the only decision I know, which is the Texaco
decision of the Fifth Circuit in 1969.
In that particular context, the Labor Board found
a violation of Section 8(a)(1) because the employer violated
the employee's right to union representation and it was a
disciplinary interview.
Upon appeal, the Fifth Circuit said that they
found no basis upon which an employer is required to permit
an employee representative to be present and', further, that
the investigation was not disciplinary but it was investi­
gatory .
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Well, that —
It is that dichotomy which has been

created because of the decision of that court.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you are complaining about the

dichotomy that I had — which would suggest that you might
be accepting the validity of it in the disciplinary kind of
meaning.

31
MR, MARTIN:

Well, your Honor, in the context of

deciding upon which basis an employer will permit employee
request and will not. It is far more comfortable for the
employer to face the disciplinary interview dichotomy than
It is the situation which is now pressed upon us by the
Labor Board.
QUESTION:

Well, we are dealing here — the

question here is, what does.the statute require?
^

MR. MARTIN:

We are of the position that the

statute does npt require union representation, an employee’s

request for union representation, at either -~
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

At either —
—> an investigatory or

a disci­

plinary interview.
QUESTION:

Or at anything until

or unless the

disciplinary action is a grievance.
MR. MARTIN:

Correct.

There has been a previous

decision involving what was termed "Inchoate grievance,"
that is, a predecisional matter and the board again found
that disciplinary action was so remote that it did not
warrant finding of a violation and we would take the
position that the dichotomy Is not soundly based in statute
but it is far more of a reasonable standard for both the
employer and the employee to rest upon than a decision
which is based upon the employee's fear.

32
QUESTION:

But, again, you are confusing me.

If

you are — I don't know if you are attacking the dichotomy
or if you are saying no representation is statutorily
required at all at any interview.
MR. MARTIN:

At either an investigatory or a

disciplinary interview.

That is our position.

Then you don’t have to worry about any

dichotomy.

QUESTION:

Why, because you didn’t discipline

MR. MARTIN:

Because the purpose of the interview

was not to determine the extent of discipline nor was
there a decision made that discipline would be taken before
the interview began.
QUESTION:

Well, what was the purpose of the

Interview?
MR. MARTIN:

The purpose of the intervievf was to

determine if there was a basis for the suspicions which
had been created in the mind of the employer by a fellow
employee of Mrs. Collins, who was under the impression
that she had taken more chicken than she had

paid for.

But the record is clear that neither party that
was present for the employer had authority to make any
decision concerning discipline based upon the facts.

— you do take the same position as the

35
interpretation of the statute is that concerted activities
do not include the right of an employee to have represen­
tation at an employer interview.
MR. MARTIN:

Correct, your Honor, that is correct.

The present position of the board, besides
leaving other decisions which apparently are conflicts
upon their face also placed both the employee and employer
at their own peril.
It subjects the employee to a review by a person
other than himself or herself, in this case, as to what is
reasonable cause, or what are reasonable grounds.
It Is submitted that, had this case been decided
in 1971, the Labor Board would have taken the position that
no violation occurred for in the Illinois Bell Telephone
case, the employee was called in concerning alleged thefts.
He was asked concerning thefts.
union representation.

He requested

The company repeatedly denied that

representation and he furnished a statement admitting the
thefts.
In that case, the Labor Board found that the
administrative law judge’s opinion was right and denied the
contention of the union that representation should be
afforded in investigatory stages of those cases involving
misconduct which could result, conceivably, in criminal
prosecution.

36
QUESTION:

Well, are you contending that the rule

you subscribed to

not only is beneficial to the employer

but also to the employee?
I mean, it seems to me what you are saying is,
under the rule you contend for, or under the statute, no
finding could ever be made in favor of the employee.

the board's rule, occasionally it will be.
Now, if I were an employee, I'd rather have a rule
that would occasionally benefit me than one that would never
benefit me.

"

"’*•
■

MR. MARTIN:

-...

Under the rule as it is stated now,

your Honor, the rule says "where it may possibly result in
a decision adversely affecting his inclement''1 status."
That permits a broad possibility, .of maze and under
that circumstance, it would be very difficult, for an
employee not to be entitled to protection because he could
fear that it may possibly result in disciplinary action
"r

under even the most innocuous circumstances,
What we are saying is that, in an investigatory
interview, there is no

coercive atmosphere automatically

Imputed to it.
The board has further confused the issue by its
decision in Western Electric Company.

There, the two

members, Pinello and Kennedy, voted that there was no
statutory right, were joined by Chairman Miller, who found

37
that where the employer had previously arbitrated the
issue of whether or not an employee is entitled, to
representations at an investigatory interview, that since
it had been previously decided adversely to the union in
prior arbitration cases, that this was sufficient to permit
the employer to deny the representation in this case and
he found that it was consistently a statutory scheme to
permit such a ruling.
So where we have a situation where there is no
basis upon which an employer's either purpose or intention
or knowledge controls his own unfair labor practices, then
we are at a situation xvhere speculation, where subjective
state of mind of the employee controls an employer's unfair
labor practice.
And the role of the union representative is
largely unrefined, as it is now stated.
Before the- Court, at Mobil, the

board took the

position that the representative of the union was merely
there present as an advisor, as a conciliator perhaps.
If you follow the logic of the board's position
and of the statute where the union is the exclusive
bargaining representative of its employees, then perhaps
the union would be in a position to preclude the employer
from directing any questions to the employee directly, but
would have to go through the union as the exclusive

38
representative of the employee to direct any questions
concerning the employee's activities.
We would summarize by saying that an investigatory
interview is a premature stage at which the right of
representation exists because the purpose is to merely
elicit, In a true fact-finding investigation, the facts of
the matter and not to predecide or to preseal a decision
of an employer or the fate of an employee.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Martin.

You have about three minutes left, Mr. Hardin.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK HARDIN, ESQ.
MR. HARDIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I

would conclude by pointing out to the Court that

the statutory language "concerted activity" is more than just
language.

It defines a rather broad concept.
This Court, in the Jones and LaUghlin case

upholding the constitutionality of the statute acknowledged
that it granted fundamental rights and the board’s decision
as to what that statutory language means, what content it
should be given in the real Industrial world. Is entitled
to great x?eight and should be accepted, if the Interpretation
is reasonable.
And it is reasonable here.

The board has fashioned

39
a ruls which does not grant an absolute right, the right
to the assistance arises only if there is a reasonable
objective basis for the fear that discipline is to follow.
And, even in that event, the employer is given
the option of foregoing the interview altogether.
The board has balanced the conflicting interests
and has settled on a resolution which is well within the
perimeters of statutory language.
Here, to return to Mr. Justice REhnquist's
question again, the problem here for the reviewing court
is much the same as it is in the Linden and Wilder cases
this morning.
The Congress has left it to the board to find
the reach of the broad statutory language in the first
instance and we submit that in both these cases, the board
has reached a reasonable result and that defines the limits
of judicial review in both cases.
QUESTION:

Do you know of anything that would

prevent every collective bargaining contract to contain a
provision that representation would be allowed in all these
circumstances, all these formerly one-to-ones?
