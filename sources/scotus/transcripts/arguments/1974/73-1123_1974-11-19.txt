PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first this morning in No. 73-1123» United States against
Feola.
Mr. Tuttle.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TUTTLE:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Sorae three years ago in United States v. Crixumins,

123 F. 2d 271, judge Learned Hand ruled for the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals that in a prosecution for conspiracy to
violate Federal law, the Government must prove the defendant's
knowledge of the Federal jurisdictional element even when
such knowledge need not be shown in a prosecution for the
underlying substantive offense.
This case presents this Court’s first opportunity
to consider this anomaly in the law of conspiracy.

The

Crimmins rule has been widely criticized and has been rejected
in some circuits, but it remains the law in the Second
Circuit and was applied by that court in this case to reverse
Respondent Feola's conviction for conspiracy to commit an
assault upon a Federal officer.
The evidence in the case showed, and the jury
found, that Feola and his co-conspirators planned a narcotics
rip-off, that is, a scheme to rob or defraud prospective

4
purchasers of narcotics.

Pursuant to this plan co-conspirator

Farr met with a prospective purchaser of narcotics and arranged
to sell a kilogram of heroin for $30,000.

Unfortunately for

the plan and for the conspirators, the prospective purchaser
was Agent Jeffrey Hall, of the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, acting in an undercover capacity.
On the day of the proposed sale. Agent Hall, in the
company of fellow undercover agent Lightcap and an informant
were taken to an apartment on West 68th Street in New York
City by co-conspirators Farr and Rosa.

They were admitted to

the apartment on 68th Street by one Alsondo.

Agent Hall was

then taken into a bac3c bedroom and then shown an open attache
case containing a quantity of a substance which was represented
to be heroin but was in fact a form of sugar.

As Hall left

the bedroom, he observed Alsondo in the process of drawing a
gun on his fellow agent Lightcap.

Hall shouted out a warning

to his fellow agent and also yelled that they were Federal
agents.
The two agents then subdued Alsondo.
agent Lightcap subdued Rosa

After that

and the agents arrested the

reamining co-conspirators, including Feola, the respondent in
this case, who was found hiding in a closet.
The conspirators, Feola and the others, were charged
with assault upon a Federal officer in violation of 18 USC
Section 111.

They were also charged with conspiracy to commit

5
that assault in violation of 18 USC 371»

The trial court in

conformance with the settled law on the subject charged the
jury that knowledge that the-victira of the assault was a
Federal officer was not an element of the offense under
section 111.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, you say settled lav/.

Has

this Court ever so spoken?
MR. TUTTLE:
particular issue.

This Court has not so spoken on that

However, it is the law -— well, there are

a number of considerations about that subject matter.
First of all, that question is not the question upon
which certiorari was granted in this case.

The question on

which cert was granted was the question of the application of
the Criiumins rule.
Also, I think that in terras of being settled law,
we were able to count nine of the circuits all uniformly
holding that such knox/ledge was not required.

There are a

number of reasons why such knowledge is not required, and if
there is any doubt in the mind of any member of the Court, I
xi/ould take the time to explicate the reasons, but I do suggest
that's not the question on which cert was granted-.
As I said, the court also charged the jury that the
knoxv’ledge of the victim's official status was not an element
under the conspiracy count either.

Under these instructions

Feola and his co-conspirators were convicted on both counts

6
and appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

The

Court of Appeals reversed the conspiracy convictions, holding
again in conformance with the settled law, that while such
Knowledge was not required, knowledge of the victim's official
status was not required under section 111, the court did hold
that such knowledge was required in a prosecution for a
conspiracy to commit that assault.
The court reached this conclusion not by an analysis
of section 111, but by an application of the Crimmins rule.
And the court followed. Crimiains as controlling precedent indicating
that it was somewhat reluctant to do so, but in light of the
age and the long standing of the case did follow it.
QUESTION;

Of course, Mr. Tuttle, while you are

quite correct, that is the question on which certiorari was
granted, i.e., the validity of the Crimmins rule, as you answered
in response to ray brother Blaokmun's question, this Court has
never settled the law as to the necessity of knowledge of the
Federal jurisdictional element in a substantive offense.
And if the law were otherwise from what you contend to be
settled law, of course, there would be no anomaly at all,
would there?
MR. TUTTLE;

There would be no anomaly and you would

have to affirm the Second Circuit.

It would be an alternative

ground for the affirmance of the opinion below, because our
contention is simply a contention for symmetry in the law.

7
QUESTION;

Symmetry could equally be achieved by

saying that the jurisdictional e3.ement need be proved both to
the substantive events and the conspiracy.
MR. TUTTLE;

Absolutely, and because you raise that,

Mr. Justice, I think maybe I should speak briefly about that
subject.
As I have indicated, the courts of appeal are
unanimous in indicating that such knowledge is not required.
Indeed, therespondent Feola agrees with this.

He indicates

in his brief that such knowledge is not required in a substan­
tive offense.

Moreover, I think it is quite clear that

Congress knows how to draft a statute.

And when they wish to

require knowledge of an element, they can so state.
I would cite to the Court, for instance, the
assault upon a process server statute, section 1501, which
provides that whoever assaults, beats, or wounds any officer
or other person duly authorised, knowing him to be such
officer

or other person duly authorized,in the process of

serving a writ,

he commits a crime against the United States.

So in that instance, the Congress has very explicitly required
knowledge,

Here they clearly have not.
I think that the protection of Federal officers

requires the Federal court to assert jurisdiction whenever a
Federal officer is involved.

Otherwise, it would put the

protection of Federal officers in many instances in the hands

8

of State courts which might not be hospitable to such claims.
One can imagine, for instance —
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

A removal statute would take care of that.
Well, I don't mean to say that the

officer charged with a crime.

Of course, removal would take

care of that, but if the officer is a victim of a crime, the
removal statute —
QUESTION:

The removal statute would take care of

that, too»
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

I am not —
... removal statutes, or at least were

when FBI agents were victims, Federal agents were victims,
at least of murder.

Thera was a statute providing removal

of tiie trial to the Federal court of an offense that would
otherwise have been in the State court.
MR. TUTTLE:

I confess I didn’t notice that in looking

at the removal statutes.
QUESTION:

If removal were generally available, that

would tend to solve this problem, wouldn’t it?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, it would solve the problem of

being remanded to the State courts for protection.

It wouldn't

solve all of the problems involved in the protection of Federal
officers. If knoxtfledge were required, the protection xrould
obviously be of a lesser degree.
I think if you look at analogous statutes, it

9
becomes clear, at least over the long history of these statutes,
that a knowledge of the Federal, or knowledge of the jurisdic­
tional element, or the official status of the individual, has
not been required, X. noticed in section 112(a) for instance,
which deals with assaults upon ambassadors and foreign ministers
that you can go back to cases in the 1810's and 1820's dealing
with the question of whether knowledge that the man is a
foreign ambassador or foreign minister, and those cases hold
that such knowledge is not required.
I think an analogous statute would be the theft of
Government property statute which has generally been held —
and this is not entirely settled, but it has generally been
4

held that to commit the crime in violation of section 641,
the Government has to show that there was a theft, but not
necessarily that the defendant knew that the property came
from the United States.
And I think that it would bs a mistake to have
Federal jurisdiction turn on the state of mind of the person
committing the assault.
purposes of the inquiry.

It would seem to me to deflect the
You would have a case where the

assault was admitted and all the elements of the crime admitted
and the fact that the man is a Federal officer admitted, and
the litigation turns entirely on the state of mind of the
person committing the assault.
X think as a final thought on this matter, that the

10
notion that knowledge ought to be required comes from viewing
section 111 as essentially an obstruction of justice statute,
and I think if you look at the words of the statute, it clearly
is not that, because it makes it a crime to commit an assault
on any individual named in section 1114.

And if you look at

1114, that includes a wide variety of officers, such as
Agriculture Department officials, and Post Office employees
who would not ordinarily be included as officials executing the
law, the interference with whom would be an obstruction of
justice .
In any event, I do suggest that this is not the
question that the Court took, and I would like to return to the
Crimmins rule which is the principle before the Court.
The Court of Appeals, as I indicated, did apply the
Crlitimins rule in this case, and they are petitioning, seeking
to have the Crimmins rule overturned as applied to reverse
respondent Peola’s conviction for conspiracy.
Crimmins itself involved a conspiracy to transport
stolen securities in interstate commerce.

Crimmins was a

lawyer in Syracuse and received the stolen securities from

a confederate in New York City.

The evidence did shew that

the bonds had in fact traveled in interstate commerce and it
showed that Crimmins agreed to receive them, knowing them to
have been stolen.

However, the evidence did not show that

Crimmins knew of the bonds6 interstate movement.

11
While Judge Hand assumed that the evidence was
sufficient to support a conviction for the underlying substan
tive offense, the transportation of stolen securities in
interstate commerce, he held -that the evidence would not
sustain a conviction for conspiracy to commit that offense
because the evidence didn *fc show that Crimrains had knowledge
of the bonds' interstate movement.
Judge Hand supported this conclusion principally
by reference to an analogy, an analogy which we treat in our
brief, which we think is both seductive and v/rong.

He says,

"While one may be guilty of running past a traffic light
of whose existence one is ignorant, one cannot be guilty of
conspiracy to run past such a light for one cannot agree
to run past the light unless one supposes -there is a light
to run past."
And we think this analogy fails to demonstrate the
conclusion that it is used for in a number of ways.

To us

it indicates the true but trivial proposition that there
can't be a conspiracy without an object, which is to say
men can’t agree when they have no subject matter to agree
say
about.
But that tautology does not/men can't conspire when
they do have a definite criminal objective in mind but are
simply unaware of a fact which is necessary to establish the
jurisdiction of a particular court.
Here the conspirators definitely did have a criminal

12
objective in mind*
Federal agents.
and Lightcap.

They could and did agree to assault the

That is to say, they agreed to assault Hall
And they knew that the conduct they were

proposing to undertake was criminal conduct.

The only thing

they didn’t know was that Hall and Lightcap were Federal
officers

so that the crime they were committing was a Federal

crime rather than a State crime.
We have suggested the inapplicability of this
analogy, the traffic light analogy, can be shown if you
substitute ignorance of the jurisdictional element which is
all that we have in this case, for ignorance of the object of
the conspiracy.

And such an analogy might be one may be

guilty of running past a traffic light on an Indian reservation
in ignorance of the fact that it lies on an Indian reservation.
But the analogy would continue, one cannot conspire to run
past such a light because one cannot agree to run past a
light unless he knows that it lies on an Indian reservation.
Framed this way, we think the analogy is senseless, even on
its own terms.
When a conspiracy does have a definite criminal
objective, it’s our suggestion that ignorance of which lav/
would apply is no more relevant to the conspiracy than .it is
to the underlying substantive offense.

This is the view of

the American Law Institute in their draft model penal code
in their section on conspiracy, which is section 503.

They

13
treat the Crfmrains rule problem and have this to say:

"Although

a conspiratory agreement must be made with the purpose of
promoting or facilitating the commission of a crime, we think
it strongly arguable that such a purpose may be proved even
though the actor did not know the existence of c i rc vans tan ces
which do in fact exist

when knowledge of such circumstances

are not required for the underlying substantive offense."
As we see the issue in this case, it’s whether men
can conspire to commit a Federal crime in ignorance of facts
necessary to constitute Federal jurisdiction, and we submit
that this Court has already answered this question and answered
it in the affirmative in United States v„ Freed, 401 U.S.
In Freed the defendant was charged with possession and conspiracy
to possess hand grenades, which had not been registered in the
National Firearms Register and transfer record.
The district court

dismissed the indictment for

failure to allege that the defendant knew that the guns or
the hand grenades were unregistered.

And this Court reversed

the district court, holding that knowledge of the fact that
the hand grenades were unregistered, as distinct from proof
that they were in fact unregistered, was not an element of
either the substantive offense or the conspiracy to commit it.
This Court — it wa3 significant to this Court that
the possession of hand grenades was not viewed as an act innocent
in itself.

Thus, the Court didn't answer the question of

14
whether men could conspire to commit an act innocent in itself
in ignorance of the prohibition.

They felt that it was

perfectly clear that the possession of hand grenades was not
an act innocent in itself., and in these circumstances the
Court concluded that the knowledge required for the substantive
offense would satisfy the requirement of the conspiracy.
We think the same reasoning applies to this case,
that the agreement to assault or the assault is not an act
innocent in itself, so that, as in Freed, the elements of
the substantive offense should satisfy the elements of the
conspiracy.
The Crimmins rule appears to proceed from the notion
that to exclude the jurisdictional element from the requirement
of knowledge would somehew result in an expansion of the scope
of the conspiracy beyond what was agreed to by the conspirators.
But if it is recognised that the jurisdictional fact is
logically no part of the crime itself, then it follows that
ignorance of that fact does not result in an expansion of the
scope of the conspiracy.
X think it is significant that the Second Circuit
which created the Crimmins rule and applied it in this case
has recently begun to back away from a consistent application
of the Crimmins rule.

Only last July in United States v.

Morrow, 501 F. 2d 45, the Second Circuit sustained a conviction
for conspiracy to receive property which had. been stolen from a

15

federally insured bank.

While the court found as a fact that

the defendant was probably on notice of the fact that the bonds
came from a national bank, the court went on to express its
strong doubt that such knowledge would even bo required to
sustain a conspiracy conviction.

In Morrow the Court of

Appeals for the Second Circuit declined to follow through on
this reasoning because it recognized that Feola, this case, was
pending in this Court

and that this Court would have an

opportunity to consider and possibly to resolve the Crirnmins
anomaly in this case.

That's what we urge this Court to do

today.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.
IIR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well, Mr. Tuttle.

Mr. Bellantoni.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. BELLANTONI
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BELLANTONI:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I represent the respondent Feola and I

represented him in that trial in the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
Mr. Feola and his co-defendants were indicted under
two counts:

Conspiracy to violate section 111 and a violation

of section 111 of the U.S. Code.
New, the first count of the indictment used the

16
language that they conspired to impede, assault, interfere with
Federal officers.

And the second count read that they did

impede, assault Federal officers.
Now, what does this conspiracy consist of?
broad a conspiracy as the Crimmins conspiracy?
as Freed?

It is as narrow as Cr.immins.

Is it as

Is it as broad

The assault took place

in a short period of time that was of short duration and the
assault would not have taken place had the defendants

knowledge

of the identity of the victims of the assault.
QUESTION:

Where do you find that conclusion

supported?
MR. BELLANTONI:
conclusion.

Well, Judge, logic supports that

I don't think that people would intentionally, in

a case like this, intend to rip off two narcotics agents
knowing that they are narcotics agents.

I think that the

intent here was the —
QUESTION:

You mean you are limiting that -- they

wouldn't have lured them up to the room.
MR. BELLANTONI:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

But after they got them there, are you

suggesting that they wouldn't, to use your terms, rip them off
in order to make their escape?
MR. BELLANTONI:

I am suggesting, your Honor, that

the plan would never have taken place had any of the defendants
had knowledge of the identity of the two men, Lightcap and Hall.

17
QUESTION:

In your view, when do they have to discover

the identity of the officers in order to bring it within
the conspiracy, the reach of the conspiracy statute?
MR. BELLANTONI:

I would say at any time they were

identified or with the requisite knowledge that sometime
before the assault took place that they had knowledge of the
identity of the two men.
QUESTION:

One of the undercover agents had dropped

his I.D. card or badge, or whatever he had, just as they ’were
at the threshold of this episode, that ttfould be soon enough,
would it?
MR. BELLANTONI:

I wouldn't think so, your Honor.

I

would think —wuuoriON:

You would not think so?

MR. BELLANTONI:

I wouldn't think so becaixse I think

an assault is something that takes place spontaneously.
QUESTION:

How long does

—- does conspiracy take

some particular span of time to be formulated?
MR. BELLANTONI:
a conspiracy to assault
bonds.

That's the question here.

This is

and not to transport interstate stolen

Mr. Crimmins sat in Syracuse.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t you formulate a conspiracy

in 60 seconds as well as 60 hours?
MR. BELLANTONI:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, you could.

Assuming that that’s an issue in the case.

18

MR. BELLANTONI i If you formulate a conspiracy in
60 seconds/ there would be less flesh to that conspiracy where
knowledge could not be inferred.
Now, the Freed case, this Court in the concurring
opinion stated that the possession of hand grenades, a person
has to have knowledge that there are Government regulations
here.

Mr. Crimmins sat in Syracuse and received bonds.

Now,

the duration of that conspiracy was for such a long period of
time, and Mr. Crimmins was an attorney, and I would think that
the Court could infer that he had knowledge

of the possible

interstate transportation of those bonds.
But in the opinion in the Second Circuit, Mr. Justice
Feinberg stated that people just don't go around conspiring to
assault Federal narcotics agents.

It’s possible, but in this

case, given the facts of the case, given the facts that the
defendants

were in an apartment house with five or six bags

of sugar which was probably worth more than Heroin today,
five or six bags of sugar, and given the fact that their
intent was not to sell this heroin, the intent was to take
money from some people, now, you just don't put five or six
bags of sugar in front of a Federal narcotics agent and
represent to him that this is only half a kilo.
was put about 10

kilos of heroin out there.

What they'd do
They had

absolutely no knowledge of his identity.
I think the important thing here in this case is

19

analogous with Crimmins.

The Crimmins analogy.

One must

have knowledge of the red light before one must go through it,
or try to go through it.
Nov;, going through a red light consists of an act of
very short duration.
light.

You conspire to go through this red

It doesn't happen — you just don't go back and forth

through the red light.

You don't assault Federal narcotis agents

over a long period of time.

It's a short spontaneous act.

The Government has jurisdiction under the second count,
section 111.

No intent is required.

The problem here is

that Mr c Feola received a suspended sentence on the conspiracy
count, and this is covered in the Government's brief.
QUESTION:

I take it you concede that no intent is

required under 111?
MR. BELLANTONI:

I would say that the cases in all

the circuits concede that no intent is required.
QUESTION:

You. concede it.

MR. BELLANTONI:

I would concede that point, yes.

I would say that's the rule of law in the country.
The Federal Government has jurisdiction of the
second count of the indictment. Mr. Feola when he was sentenced,
the district judge said, "Mr. Feola, I am sentencing you four
years on the conspiracy count, because I think your liability in
this case came through the conspiracy, not the assault.
had nothing to do with the actual assault.

You

I fine you $3,000

20

on the second cotint and suspend sentence.'1

That's why the

Government is here, your Honor, because Mr. Feola did not
receive a jail sentence.

They concede that in their brief,

they concede that they did not seek certiorari in the other
three cases because concurrent sentences were given to the
three co-conspirators.
Now, it seems to me that in a conspiracy to assault,
the minimum requirement would be to assault a Federal narcotics
agent.

That’s the minimum requirement.

In dealing with

interstate transportation of stolen bonds, you are talking about
conspiracy that takes place as full—blown.
inferred.

But I think that the defendant

one thing in this case.

Knowledge can be

If he conspired to assault someone,

he must have knowledge that he was a Federal narcotics agexvc.

I think it's a very simple issue in this Court.
QUESTION;

You don’t agree, then, with Mr. Tuttle

that this is merely a jurisdictional element?
IIR.. BELLANTONI:
element at this point, no.

I don't think it’s a jurisdictional
I think the Government has

jurisdiction through the second count.

The Government wants

jurisdiction on the first count and the second count.

I think

to conspire is to knowingly do something, to perform an act.
QUESTION:

What do you think of the Solicitor

General's refinement of the learned Hand analogy?
Mil. BELLANTONI:

Your Honor, I didn't understand it.

21
I read it over and over and I didn't understand it.
QUESTION:

That may be partly because the original

aphorism is somewhat difficult to understand.
MR. BELLANTONI:

Judge, I think it's very simple.

I think that here we have an assault case, not a conspiracy to
perform acts which take place over a long period of time.

I

think in an assault case, especially, there has to be knowledge,
especially in an assault case.

In Crimmins I could see where

the Court would say knowledge is inferred, and all of these
decisions, including Roselli, which the Government states in
his brief, all set forth the fact that the conspiracy was of
such great duration that knowledge could be inferred. And as I
say, in the concurring opinion in the Freed case, the
knowledge of the possession was discussed.
QUESTION:

Suppose that this man, Feola and the other

three, conspired together on the following conspiracy: "If
anybody gets in our way, he's going to get hurt."

And the

one who gets in his way happened to be a Federal officer.
MR. BELLANTONI:

I would say they would have to have

knowledge of the identity of that person.
QUESTION:

Why?

way is going to get hurt.
MR. BELLANTONI:
agree to that.

They said anybody that gets in our
They phrase it "bleed a little bit."
If they sit around a table and

I understand the question, your Honor.

I would still have to say that the requirement of knowledge

22

is necessary in view of the fact that given the facts of this
case, and given that statement, there was certainly no
knowledge on the part of any of the defendants that these were
Federal narcotics officers, and I sure —
QUESTION:

All they knew was they were in their way.

And we are going to hurt anybody who gets in our way.
MR. BELLANTONI:

That would be closer, I would think.

I would think that perhaps in that instance, knowledge can be
inferred from the very statement and the agreement between them.
QUESTION:

The only way they could be guilty was

just before they worked him over, he would have to pull out his
badge and show it to them.
HR. BELLANTONI:

I would say not even in that instance,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

That wouldn't —

MR. BELLANTONI:

Not even in that instance.

No.

Not even in that instance, because the assault took place in
such a short period of time that I don’t think — well, if we
assume that he did identify himself and it registered with the
defendants, I would say correct, they would be guilty of that
conspiracy.

But I ara saying that if just before the assault

took place he pulled out a badge. I’m sure that the defendants
at that point would not even have knowledge.

I would say they

would have to have knowledge in an assault case.

I’m not

talking about conspiracy to defraud, or transport interstate

23

securities or anything like that.

I am talking about an

assault case, simple short-duration acts.
defendant

X think the

should be afforded one tiling, knowledge that he was

a Federal narcotics agent, that's all.
QUESTIONS

Suppose, to take your hypothesis, that

at some point the men being in different rooms, one of these
defendants called out, "Joe, these are Federals, let's get
out of here," and they pulled their guns and shot their way
out, all of them.

There is no conspiracy there?

MR. BELLANTONI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

No question.

That only took 30 seconds for me to say

that.
MR. BELLANTONIs

Yes, but what happened at that

point, someone recognized and relayed the information to the
co-conspirators, to the other defendants.
QUESTION:

Would the Government have to show that

the prisoners believed the announcement?
MR. BELLANTONI:

No, I wouldn’t say that, sir.

They

wouldn't have to believe him, but at least it was a conscious
statement — a statement was made by one defendant to another,
"These are Federal officers, let's get out of here," and if
they walked out at that point and pulled their guns out and
assaulted these agents, I would say there is no question at
this point they had knowledge of the identity of the victims
of the assault

24
I think that, had Mr. Feola been given a jail
sentence on the conspiracy —■ or rather on the substantive
count, I wouldn't even be here.

And I think this is the gist

of the Government's argument.

Mr. Feola has to go to jail

as far as they are concerned.

And I think the judge in the

Second Circuit recognized, and I think that the Crimmins
rationale is good law, and it's very simple, very simple.

And

the red light doctrine and the Feola case go hand in hand
because it was a very short act of very short duration.
QUESTION:

Was the evidence that Feola was found in

the closet, that they didn't even know of his presence until
they found him in the closet
MR. BELLANTONI:

after the assault had been —

He was found in the closet approxi­

mately 10 minutes after the apartment was secured by Federal
agents.
QUESTION:

So this is long after the incident

involving the assault?
MR. BELLANTONI:

About 20 or 25 minutes after the

assault took place, yes, he was found by agents.
By the way, Mr. Feola is serving a sentence at the
present time on an unrelated conviction.
•

QUESTION:

Nov; or —

MR. BELLANTONI:
QUESTION:

At the present time.

He wasn't a fugitive at that time.

MR. BELLANTONI:

No, he was not.

It's unrelated.

25
So 1 would urge this Court to affirm the Criramins
rationale, especially in the case dealing with an assault on a
Federal narcotics agent.

I think that the Court should examine

this case as an assault case and not as a general conspiracy
involving acts and of such a duration where knowledge can be
inferred,
QUESTION:

I gather there is no contention below

that he could not have been a conspirator from the fact of
being in the closet at the time?
MR. BELLANTONI:

That was contended in both the

district court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, and on the
facts they found that he was a co-conspirator.
QUESTION:

They found no merit in that.

MR. BELLANTONI:

Based on certain hearsay by co­

defendants prior to and his presence on the premises at the
time of the assault.
Incidentally, the assault —
QUESTION:

In any event, you don31 make that argument

here, do you?
MR. BELLAMTONX:

No, I don’t make that argument here.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Tuttle, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONER

26
MR. TUTTLE:

Just a few words, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like to emphasise the point that Mr.
Bellarxtcni conceded that the substantive offense, it is not a
contention in this court

the substantive offense required

knowledge of the victim’s official status.

And the burden of

Mr. Bellantoni's argument seems to be really to point almost
to a sufficiency of the evidence claim.

And I would point

out that there was no cross petition in tills case
either challenging the substantive conviction or raising any
other issues with respect to the conspiracy.

And I would point

out just one or two items of evidence that the -QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, could he raise that question

in defense of the reversal on the conspiracy count without
cross petition?
MR. TUTTLE:

He could raise any ground, alternative

ground for the affirmance of the judgment below.

That would

only go to the conspiracy count, not to the substantive
conviction.
QUESTION:

I suggest to the conspiracy count only.

MR. TUTTLE:

Yes.

Although I understand that there

is no specific argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence,
I would point out that there was a good deal more evidence
than simply his being present there.

The agent was initially

told that Feola was the source and there were various
conversations indicating that he would be there, would be the

27
source.

After he was arrested, he lied about knowing his

co-conspirators, and that was proven by extrinsic evidence,
a book found in his possession.

He told the Assistant U.S.

Attorney on arraignment that he hadn’t done any tiling because
he said the stuff you seized was sugar.

He was obviously

cognizant of the contents of the attache case, and he could
have only known that before he was seized.

So I think there

was ample evidence to sustain his conviction, and I

just

want to underscore that single point.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:46 a.ra., the argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
