MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argument

next in Mo. 74-348, United States against State Tax Commission
of Mississippi.
Mr. Smith., you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. SMITH;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;

This

case comes here again on a second direct appeal from a threejudge district court in the Southern. District of Mississippi
to consider certain issues which were not reached by the Court
in its consideration of the first appeal.
The broad question presented is whether a regulation
of the Mississippi State Tax Commission imposes an unconstitu­
tional State tax upon instrumentalities of the United States.
The regulation in question requires out-of-state liquor
distillers to collect tax from military purchasing facilities
and to remit this tax to the State Tax Commission.
It is the position of the United States that the
district court was wrong in upholding the validity of the tax
as applied to the sales to the military purchases in the four
bases within the State of Mississippi.

The facts as before

are largely undisputed and stipulated.
Prior to 1966 Mississippi completely prohibited the

4
sale or possession of alcoholic beverages.

In 1966 it

adopted a local option beverage control law.

Those statutes

are set forth in the appendix to our brief, pages 47 and 48.
The new law provided that the State Tax Commission was to be
the sole importer and wholesaler of alcoholic beverages withir
Mississippi.

Under the statute the State Tax Commission is

authorised to sell liquor to retailers in the State, including
any retailers on military posts within the Stata,

h related

statute provides that the Commission shall add such markups
within its discretion to cover costs and provide profit.
So the statutory scheme essentially established a
monopoly by the State of Mississippi in the wholesaling of
liquor.

But the State Tax Commission promulgated so-called

Regulation 25 which is really at the heart — the validity of
which is at the heart of this case.

That regulation permits

the military to purchase liquor from the Commission, as could
anyone in Mississippi, or directly from the distillers.
However, the regulation goes on to provide that if the military
Chooses to exercise its option to purchase liquor directly
from the distiller, then the regulation provides that the
distiller must collect the markup
remit that markup

from the military and

to the State Tax Commission» the same mark­

up that would have been applicable had the military purchased
the liquor from the State Tax Commission.

During the time

c

at issue here, the markup

with respect to distilled spirits?

5
was 17 parcent, and v?ith respect to wine it was 20 percent.
New, there are four military bases in Mississippi
which this Court explored on the first appeal.

There are two

bases over which the United States maintains exclusive
jurisdiction.

Those are the Keesler Air Force Base and the

Naval Construction Battalion Center.

There are two other

bases over which the United States and Mississippi maintain
concurrent jurisdiction.

These are the Columbus Air Force Base

and the Meridian Naval Air Station.
Now, prior to 1966 Mississippi was a dry State, but
even during that time the military purchased liquor from the
out-of-state distillers.

Now, after 1966 when the new statute

cams into effect, the military continued the same practice of
purchasing liquor from out-of-state distillers directly.
Now, after Regulation 25 became effective, which essentially
told the military that even if they had continued their past
procurement practice, they were going to have to pay over the
tax to the Mississippi State Tax Commission, the military
attempted to persuade the Mississippi State tax authorities
that collection of this tax on direct purchases was improper.
As a means of providing some kind of interim
accommodation, the military suggested that the amount of taxes
at issue be paid into an escrow fund and kept there until the
matter could h® judicially determined.

But Mississippi

rejected that suggestion and in fact warned the distiller that

6

if they did not pay over the tax to the State Tax Commission
on their direst sales to the military, they would be subject
to the criminal penalties which were

imposed on the

Alcoholic Beverage Act, and they would also be subject to
delisting, which essentially meant they would lose their

‘i

privileges to sell their products to the Stats Tax Commission
for retailing in Mississippi.
Because of this onerou3 position taken by Mississippi,
the military had no choice, at least in the interim, but to
pay the amount of tax that Mississippi claimed to be due and
owing.

As of July 1971 the record indicates that there was

some §650,000 collected, and now the military advises me that
as of the beginning of this year the sum is something like
$1,250,000.
Now, this particular suit was brought in 1969
before a three-judge district court.

The United States asked

for three modes of relief, a declaration that the Regulation 25
was unconstitutional because it imposed a tax upon Federal
instrumentalities? an injunction against its further enforce­
ment; and a money judgment in the amount of the taxes that
had thus far been collected.
Now, the first time around the three-judge district
court simply held that the 21st Amendment preempted the
entire field and that that empowered the State of Mississippi
to impose this taxon sales to military purchasers. On the

7
first direct appeal this Court reversed and vacated the
judgment of the district court.

It held with respect to the

exclusive jurisdiction bases that the 2Xst Amendment had no
application.

The reason that the majority of this Court

indicated was simply that the 2l3t Amendment which speaks of
importation of alcoholic beverages into any State did not
apply to the exclusive jurisdiction bases because those bases
as the district court itself acknowledged, in its first
consideration might as well have been in a sister State or
in a foreign country.

They simply are not part of the State

of Mississippi.
But the Court did not reach the issues which are now
before it for resolution, that is, questions of intergovern­
mental immunity and with respect to both the exclusive juris­
diction bases and the concurrent jurisdiction bases.
Now, on remand, the district court again dismissed
the Federal Government's suit, and it did so by holding that
the tax at issue here was on the out-of-state distiller and
not on the military purchaser, so that there was supposedly
no unconstitutional tax on the United States.
The district court further held that even if a tax
were on the military purchaser, Congress had consented to the
tax, and the district court rejected the Government's
constitutional tax immunity doctrine argument on the same
ground

8
Now, before I begin to talk about what the parties
disagree about, I think it would be helpful to the Court if
I set forth what are three points of agreement between the
United States and the State of Mississippi in this lawsuit.
To begin with, the parties are in agreement with the
district court's conclusion that the State's Regulation 25
imposes a tax.
Secondly, parties are in agreement with the district
court's finding that the ship stores, the officers clubs and
the post exchanges involved in these cases on both the
exclusive jurisdiction bases and on the concurrent jurisdiction
bases are Federal instrumentalities.

As Federal instrumental!”

ties, as arms of the Federal Government, they are entitled to
whatever immunity from State taxation that the United States
would enjoy.
And thirdly, the parties agree with the district
court's statement in this case that the constitutional
principle of Federal tax immunity which this Court has
reaffirmed on many occasions applies only to bar a tax whose
legal incidence falls upon the United States.
So putting aside those three points of agreement,
I would like to now turn to what we think is the essential
point in this case, and that is the error of the district
court's holding that the legal incidence of this tax is not
on the United States

9
Nowg the district court construed the term ,s legal
incidence" which this Court has used many times to mean the
legally enforceable liability —
QUESTION 5

Would you be making the same argument if

•

this case had come here from the State Court of Mississippi?
MR. SMITH s
I think so.

Would we be making the same argument?

I think -~

QUSSTION:

MR. SMITHS
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SMITH?

I think the Court has on occasion in

its intergovernmental immunity cases stated that what the
State's highest construction of its statute is certainly
persuasivep but in the Agricultural Bank case, upon which we
heavily rely, I think the Court also said that since it does
involve a constitutional principlet that the Court feels free
to reexamine the basis of that State court’s holdings.
QUESTION:

So in terms of the question I asked, there

is no difference between the Federal court and the State court.
MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

I don't think so.
Well, at least this much.
Yes.

MR. SMITH:

I think that’s right.

QUESTIONS

Considerable weight, and so forth.

MR. SMITH:

I think that's absolutely right, Mr.

Justice Brennan.

But in the Agricultural Bank case I think

the Court after stating that — and that case did cosao here
from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts — the Court
want on to disagree with the Massachusetts highest court’s
interpretation of —
QUESTION:

I think there is implicit in the way we

have stated it that it's still open.
MR. SMITH:

I think that's absolutely right.

think that's absolutely right.

I

We think on the basis of the

Court's analysis in Agricultural Bank v. State Tax Commission
that the legal incidence of this tax plainly falls on the
United States and that the district court's construction of
the term "legal incidence" is that the legally enforceable
liabilities for nonpayment is an improper test.
Now, I think it would be instructive if I simply
compared —
QUESTION:

Would you mind saying now what is the

Government’s position as to the proper definition of legal
incidence?

11
MR. SMITH;

W© think the proper definition of

"legal incidence" is that
you this way:

in other words, let zn© put it to

That if the statute requires that the tax be

passed on and collected from the purchaser, as it was in
Massachusetts and as it is in this case, then v?e believe that
the legal incidence of the tax falls upon the purchaser and
not upon the vendor, simply because the vendor pays the tax
over, w© believe that simply —
QUESTION:

When the vendor is free not to do so,

then it is really only shifting the economic burden and doesn't
affect the incidence.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes.
Legal incidence.
Right.

But hare, as in Massachusetts, Regulation 25
requires that the out-of-state distiller pass on the tax to
the military.

And indeed, if there was any question about

the interpretation —
QUESTIONs

Doas your opposition concede that, Mir.

Smith?
MR. SMITH:

I don't think — well, I think to the

extent that our opposition talks about the Agricultural Bank
case here, X think what they have argued to the Court is that
that case is not germane because it didn't involve a
constitutional holding.

Well, we are fully in agreement with

12
the fact that the Agricultural Bank did not involve a
constitutional holding because the Court rested the immunity
of national banks in that case upon a Federal statute, a
Federal statute of long standing.

It was a revised, statute.

I am not sure that my opposition really addresses
itself to what v/e think is the critical point of the
Agricultural Bank, and that is the mode of analysis that the
Court used to construe the term "legal incidence."
QUESTION:

Don't they place a great deal of

emphasis on the ability of the distiller to absorb this tax
himself?
MR. SMITH:

They do place some emphasis upon that,

but I think that the Court in Agricultural Bank simply said
— in fact, it's really right at the end, because the same
point was made in Agricultural Bank, and the Court right at
the end of its opinion said, "It seems clear to us that the
force of the lav; is such that regardless of sanctions
businessmen will attempt in their everyday commercial affairs
to conform to its provisions as v/ritfcen."
Now, the provisions as written in the Massachusetts
tax and in this tax require the out-of-state distiller to
pass on the tax.

And indeed, if there would be any question

about the construction of Regulation 25, the State of
Mississippi issued a warning to the out-of-state distillers
saying that they had to collect the tax from the military

13
purchasers»

The warning is set forth in the appendix at

pages 38 and 39.

It's a letter from the Director of the

Alcoholic Beverage Control Division which said, BSaid fee
must be invoiced to the Military and collected directly from
the Military or other authorised organization located on, the
Military base.”

And then the letter concludes by saying,

"In addition to penalties imposed by law, products presently
sold by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division will be
delisted^ and that is underlined.
I think that if there would be any question of
construction, I think that the administrative position that the
State tax authorities took indicated that the out-of-state
distiller had to pass on this tax.

And since he had to pass

it on, as a matter of lav;, we think that consistent with the
Court’s Agricultural Bank analysis, that the legal incidence
of the tax must fall upon the military —
QUESTION:

Do you distinguish James v. Pravo, that

there the contractor could or could not pass it along, depending
on what fee felt like doing?
MR. SMITH:

Well, James v, Pravo dealt with several

different points, but I think that there that is a distinction,
essentially the contractor could or could not.

Those cases

like James v. Bravo and Alabama v. King & Boomer cn which the
opposition relies, 1 think turn really in part on — really
turn on the question of who is the purchaser in that case.

I

14
don't think there was any quarrel that the tan fell upon the
purchaser.

In fact, the Agricultural Bank analysis of this

Court is not really now to Agricultural Bank.

The opinion

talked about, or cites, Federal Land Bank v. Bizmark Lumber
Company which is way back in Volume 314 of the United States
Reports.

This is standard analysis that this Court has used

that when a sales tax must be passed on as a matter of law,
the legal incidence of the tax is on the purchaser.

The

Court referred to it again in a footnote in the National Bellas
Hess case.

purchaser?

The legal incidence in King S Boozer
The question was then who is the

And the Court finally determined that the

purchaser in that case was the private contractor.
We don’t have any private contractor in this case.
This is simply a question of the Federal Government is
dealing for itself.
Once one recognizes that the tax is on the military
purchaser, that the legal incidence of the tax is on the
military purchaser, then it cannot be valid, and it is
unconstitutional unless Congress has consented to the tax
or in this case, since we are involved with alcoholic beverages,
unless the 21st Amendment holds some sway in the area.

15

Hoy;, X would Ilk© to ~~ our analysis now proceeds
along two separate lines, because we had tv;o kinds of bases
involved in this case.

We had exclusive jurisdiction bases,

and we had the concurrent jurisdiction bases.
How, on the exclusive jurisdiction bases, it is
plain that the 21st Amendment has no application because that
was essentially the core of this Court's conclusion on the
first direct appeal.
QUESTIONS

The instrumentality argument is the same

with respect to both of them.
MR. SMITH;

The instrumentality argument is the same.

So with respect to Kessler and the Naval Construction
Battalion Canter, the 21st Amendment has no application, so
the only other avenue under which the tax could be sustained
would be if Congress had given consent to such a tax.
Now, Mississippi relies upon the district court’s
conclusion that section 105(a) of the Buck Act provides such
consent.

Now, that statute is set forth in our appendix

to our brief at page 46, and it essentially says that no
person shall be relieved from liability for payment of any
sales or use tax levied by any State on the ground that the
sale or use with respect to which the tax was levied occurred
in whole or in part within a Federal area.

So as far as the

district court read, that language and said that constitutes
Congressional consent, we disagree.

We don't think the Buck

16
Act, that -'chat provision of the Buck Act can be read in
isolation, because when Congress passed the Buck Act, it
just didn't enact section 105, but it also enacted section 107
which we have reproduced directly thereunder.

And that says

that the provisions of section 105 shall not be deemed to

i

authorize the levy or collection of any tax on or from the
United States or any instrumentality thereof.
Now, all that section 105(a) of the Buck Act
does is to put a Federal enclave on the same footing as the
normal territory of the State with ; respect to the imposition
of the specified tax.

In other words, a taxpayer cannot say,

“My transaction took place in a Federal enclave."

That is

;V

not a sufficient defense after Congress passed the Buck Act.
But what Congress did simultaneously, and the
hearings are replete with testimony from people who came
forward and were afraid that Congress was about to whittle
away at the constitutional doctrines long expounded by this
Court as early as Chief Justice Marshall that Federal
instrumentalities might be in danger.

So Congress eracted

section 107 to reaffirm that doctrine which goes back to
McCulloch v. Maryland, that the States cannot impose a tax
upon Federal instrumentalities.
Now, if we are right, as we submit we are, that
the real incidence of the tax falls upon the Federal
instrumentality, then the Buck Act supplies no congressional

17
consent because section 107(a) of the Buck Act constitutes
an explicit reservation by Congress and reaffirmation
the protection that Federal instrumentalities are supposed to
have from Stata taxation.
*

.■*

Now, turning to the concurrent jurisdiction bases,
there are different considerations that are applied.
here we have the 21st Amendment is applicable.

Because

The concurrent,

jurisdiction bases over which the United States and Mississippi
exercise simultaneous sovereignty are part of the State of

doctrine.

But we also have a competing constitutional

We have the doctrine of Federal tax immunity, which

I just alluded to as expressed in section 107(a) of the Buck
Act.
Now, we submit that nothing in the history or the
terms of the 21st Amendment suggests that there was supposed
to be an exception for alcoholic beverages with,respect to the
Federal tax immunity doctrine.

The legislative history and

the statements on the floor of Congress by its sponsors
specifically make reference to the fact that it was not to
altar the fundamental principles of federalism upon which the
nation was founded.
What we have here is simply a design of Congress to
give back to the States control over liquor which the Federal
Government had preempted during the period of prohibition,
Now, the Court has had on previous occasions two

18

opportunities which we think are instructive here to balance
the policy of the 21st Amendment when it conflicts with other
previsions of the Constitution.

The two cases to which we

make reference in our brief are Hostetfcer v. Idlewlld Bon
Voyage Liquor Corp.

case and the Department of Revenue v.

James Beam Company case.

Those cases decided both on the

same day dealt with situations in which two conflicting
provisions of the Constitution collided, so to speak.
Now, in Hostetter what you had essentially was the
State of New York had attempted to shut down an airport
liquor retailer which sold liquor to departing international
passengers.

The State of New York attempted to do this,

grounded its regulatory authority that the establishment was
unlicensed and unlicensable

under the 21st Amendment.

Now, the retailer, though, on the other hand,
pointed to the fact that he was engaged in international
commerce and that the commerce clause of Article 1 says
that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the
several States and with, foreign nations apply, and that mads
the StateJ & power subordinate under the 21st Amendment.

He

also pointed to the fact that the Bureau of Customs had
licensed him under the Tariff Act which presumably was passed
by Congress under its Article 2 power to regulate conmerce
with foreign nations.
What the Court did was essentially to say that it is

19
right that the 2ist Amendment gives the State power to
regulate liquor, but here where we have a competing considera­
tion, that is, the consideration of international commerce,
the amendment has to yield.
Now, to the extent that the legislative history of
the 21st Amendment indicates that the 21st Amendment had any
impact at all, it is in the impact of commerce, because it8s
supposed to lessen whatever potential commerce clause problema
might be applicable.

But even so, the Court felt that the

competing considerations of international commerce require
that the 21st Amendment be subordinated.
We think that this case would seem to follow a fortio
because we are not dealing with a situation where the commerce
clause is even remotely applicable.

What we are dealing with

here is Article VI of the supremacy clause upon which this
Court has announced an unbroken line of decisions saying that
because this Constitution is the supreme law of the land, the
United Statos cannot be subject to taxation by States.
Now, the James Beam Company case : .
offers another example of that sort of thing.

re illy just
The tax involve-

was a Kentucky tax on State liquor, on the importation of
Scotch whisky, and that conflicted with the export-import
clause.

And again the Court subordinated the 21Bt Amendment

to the export-import clause.
We would suggest that similarly the 21st Amendment

20

with respect to the concurrent jurisdiction bases be subordinated
to the Federal tax immunity doctrine»

are other questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. WRIGHT ON BEHALF
OF APPELLEES

I think it"s clear from the argument you have

and the tax is laid
within the State.

Now, the tax is not laid by the
by a State statute of Mississippi,
on the business of wholesaling liquor

The State has preempted for itself that

the tax takes the form of a collection of the difference
»

between the wholesaler's price and the price to the retailer,
less, of course, whatever wholesaling costs the State may
incur.
Now, the regulation gives the military an option.
I take it they are not complaining about the option because
an option is not a burden, an option is a privilege.

What

the regulation does is give them a flexibility they wouldn't
otherwise have by allowing them to order direct in certain
instances, but when they do order direct from the distiller,

21
the distiller then, of course, is sharing in tin© State's
wholesale monopoly and must account to the State for the
State's wholesale markup, which is the tax, the difference
between the wholesaler's price and the price to the retailers.
Now, those prices are not set by the Stata. Each
distiller sets his own price, he makes his own deal, whether
he deals either directly with the State or whether he deals
directly with the distiller —
QUESTION:

Doesn't the regulation tell the distiller

to collect a certain markup?
MR. WRIGHT;

The regulation tells him, of course,

and he —QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT;

And he is supposed to do that.
He is supposed, of course, to collect

a markup so that ha will have the funds to pay the State
its tax, but the tax is levied on him, he is required to
pay tl^e markup to the State whether or not he ever collects
it.
QUESTION:

Ee is also supposed to collect it from

his purchasers.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, he has to invoice it, of course.

TJiis tax is a percentage of the wholesaler's price, and the
only way you know in these exceptional situations wiore ha's
allowed to buy from the distiller what the amount of tax is
is to require him to list on the invoice the wholesaler's

price and the percentage amount which reflects the State's
markup or tax.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wright,

did

you say that the tax

can never be collected from the purchaser, it must be collected
from the distiller or not at all?
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, the State, itself, of course, whan

it sells a private retailer collects the tax in the form of
the purchase price of the liquor.
QUESTION;

In this situation, suppose the distiller

was unable to collect the tax?
MR. WRIGHT:

He pays it first before — he pays the

tax when he bills the retailer, and it's a matter of total
indifference to the State whether or not he then is able to
receive reimbursement for the tax.

By the nature of things,

a tax which takes the form of a wholesale markup even without
any urging, if Dr. Beacham had never written that letter
telling them that they should collect the tax from the
purchaser, any wholesale excise tax, a tax levied on wholesale
sales is collected by the businessman from the retailer
because it is a cost of doing business.

If he doesn't collect

it, he's no businessman.
QUESTION:

If he doesn't collect it, who is

responsible for it?
MR. WRIGHT;
collects it or not

He is responsible for it, whether he

23
QUESTIONS
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Is there a time sequence here?
Yes.
Must he pay it before he delivers the

liquor to the purchaser.
MR. WRIGHT:

He pays it at the time that he invoices

the liquor, yes, he pays it.
QUESTION:

And then he —

He doesn't wait and collect it from the

purchaser before he pays the State?
MR. WRIGHT:
out.

No.

The district court pointed that

He is liable for the payment at the point ’where he

invoices, ships the liquor.
QUESTION:

So there is no way, in any event, that

the tax can be collected by the State.

The statute doesn't

provide for collection by the State from the purchaser.
MR. WRIGHT:

No, the tax is not — tills is the

whole point, the tax is not a tax levied on the purchaser, it
is a tax levied on wholesale sales, that's the subject matter
of the tax, that’s the privilege,the excise is exacted for
the,; privilege of doing a wholesale business in the State of
Mississippi.

And that tax is levied —

QUESTION:

If the State wrote a letter to the

purchaser and said, "Pay me the tax," the- purchaser under the
law should say, "I don't owe you anything."
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, certainly.

The State has never,

to my knowledge, ever —you will notice the letters in the

24
record* they are not addressed to the military retailors* they
are addressed to the distillers.

They are the people who must

pay the tax to the State when they choose to do the wholesaling
themselves instead of using the State's wholesale facilities
to distribute their liquor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wright.

MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Could the State solve this problem by

requiring that all liquor sold in Mississippi be bought from
the Mississippi State stores?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Why doesn't it do it?

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, I suggest that the purpose of the

option was for the benefit of the retailers rather than for
the State, although the State does benefit to this extent:

clubs when they want to get one ai those brands the State
doesn't stock to order it direct from the distiller.

That's

the purpose of the option so far as the thing is concerned.
QUESTION:

hnd the military uses a whole lot of

vodka.

They owe you 52 million now.

That's a. whole lot of

vodka.
MR. WRIGHTi
QUESTIONS

Wo, they don't, Mr. Justice —
I submit the record shows they buy ail

kinds of whisky.
MR. WRIGHTs

They do buy all kinds.

Ml 1 am

suggesting is there are certain kinds which the State does
not stock, and it sets the option as a convenience to them
because they can then not go. through the slower process of
ordering specially through the State? they can go directly to
the distiller, order it from him, but in that case, of course,
the tax will be collected from the distiller.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, suppose, taking the

hypothetical case which Mr. Justice Powell suggested, suppose
the State did that and then the response of the United States
was that they would load 100 trucks with all the supplies
they needed, including replacement shoes and ammunition and
peanut butter and what not along with vodka and whisky and gin
and ship the whole thing in.

Do you suggest that Mississippi

could stop that shipment and stop liquor from coming into
a military base?
MR. WRIGHT:

If they found out about it.

Gf course,

it's quite possible we don't know how much liquor may be
going into thoea bases, flown in or taken in on a destroyer
without any knowledge of the State.

All that's involved hare

26

are sales made by distillers who do exploit the Mississippi
market, that is, the sellers who want to sell not only to
military retailers, but want also to soil to private
retailers in Mississippi through the State’s wholesale
facility, that's all that's involved here.
QUESTIONs

Well, I am assuming that all the material

that I just suggested was used on military bases by military
personnel, not distributed outside of the base.

And it's

your position that Mississippi could stop that inflow?
MR. WRIGHT s
QUESTION2

If it was brought in for resale.
No, no, loose.

MR. WRlGHTs

No.

The wholesale tax applies only

— the tax only applies to liquor brought forth for resale
within the State, and this is where the Buck Act is decisive.
Now, the Buck Act was passed to make precisely this kind of
taxation possible.

The Buck Act was enacted in 1940.

Now,

a 1937 case, the case of James v. Pravo Contracting Company
had held that you did not impose an unconstitutional burden
upon the United States because your receipts were derived
from the United States.

You could sell the United States

and you could still tax sales.

That's what West Virginia did.

West Virginia taxed the receipts of contractors, construction
contractors, from Federal work, and the James case sustained
*

r

that tax except where the contractor was working on an
exclusive jurisdiction base.

The James case held as to the

27
exclusive jurisdiction bases the State has no pov?er to tax,
but it held that the fact that the sales were to the United
States did not prevent i.t from taxing those sales on the other
bases.
Now, the purpose of the Buck Act as stated in the
Senate report which is an appendix to our brief- was to extend
the doctrine of the James case to the exclusive jurisdiction
bases, that's what the purpose of the Act was/ to wipe out
this distinction that James had created between exclusive
jurisdiction bases and other joint jurisdiction bases.
QUESTION:

That's true, Mr. Wright, 1 guess, of 105,

section 105, but what about 107?
MR. WRIGHT:

107 was supposed to preserve whatever

constitutional immunity, whatever intergovernmental tax
immunity that Federal instrumentalities might have.

Now, I

suggest to you that if you will look carefully at the case
of Collins v. YoSemite Park Company again, you will see that
that case when they are dealing with a wholesale liquor tax,
in that case California's wholesale liquor tax, that that
tax was sustained because the Court found no constitutional
immunity, we are not interfering with a Federal function by
taxing sales.

You will recall in the Yosemite Park case the

Federal Government had exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over
the park.

The State, however, when it had ceded the park land

had reserved general taxing rights.

So the Court when it

28
decided the case held that California could not impose license
fees on the Interior Department concessionaire in that case,
but that it could and did impose its wholesaler's excise tax
on that retailer.

Now that was done notwithstanding the fact

that the retailer had in that case bought his liquor outside

!

the State.

But he had bought it for resale inside the State,

which is exactly what the purchasers we are talking about here
were made for, and you have precisely the same kind of a tax,
a tax on wholesale transactions.

And as the YoSemite case

held 1die fact that in that ease direct collection was made
of that wholesale sales tax from the Federal retailer did not
invalidate the tax.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, could you tax the sales of

the drinks in the exclusive camps in Mississippi?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?
On the drinks that are served in the

Officers Club on the base which the United States has
exclusive jurisdiction.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.
If you can tax the whisky that you use,

aren't you doing the same thing?
MR. WRIGHT:

No.

What you are doing here is applying

a tax on wholesale sales, that is sales made to a retailer for
resale.

That's what's being taxed, those sales.

107(a) is admittedly# both sides agree

MR. WRIGHT:

Well* the constitutional — sales to

the Panhandle Royal case.

Panhandle Royal v. Mississippi

held that sales of gasoline to the United States were in effect
taxes on the United States.

The dissenting opinion was the

one in which Justice Holmes replied to the majority’s rhetoric
about power to tax being the power to destroy, Holmes said*
”Not while this Court sits.”

And that dissenting opinion of

Holmes became prevailing law in tho James case and in the
King S Boozor

case.

QUESTION:

MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes.
King & Boozer as I recall it said that

MR. WRIGHT:

So there are no constitutional tax

sales to the United States or one of its instrumentalities
are taxes on the United States.
QUESTION:

That much is clear.

Of course, Panhandle; was a gasoline excise
And the issue there was whether when the

32
United States bought it for the Coast Guard, as I recall it,
and veterans hospitals, that made it a tax on the United
States.

But you don't doubt that instead of being a tax on

the vendor, had it been a tax on the United States directly
on its purchases, you would have no problem with that, would
you?
MR, WRIGHT:

Had it been levied on the retailer

it probably would have been invalid.
QUESTION:

But the point is —

’’Probably" if the United States were

the purchaser?
MR. WRIGHT*

If the tax were laid on the privilege

of retailing — now Mississippi has a liquor tax on the
privilege of retailing.
QUESTION:

No,but what would be tine case had the

Panhandle tax, instead of being imposed on the vendor, been
imposed on the vendee, the United States?
MR. WRIGHT:

It would have been precisely the same

because in that case, the Court held, if you are talking about
what that Court would have done —
QUESTION:
would have done.

I'm not talking about what that Court

What would be in the context of sovereign

immunity, what would be the answer?
MR. WRIGHT*

We have the answer in the James case.

The tax was imposed on sales made to the Federal Government.
QUESTION:

I guess I'm not making myself clear, Mr.

33

Wright.

Ali those oases are cases where the incidence of the

tax was on the vendor.

I am talking about the effort to impose

a tax directly upon the United States as a purchaser.
MR. WRIGHTs
QUESTION?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, that would be invalid.
That's right.
That would come within the Buck Act

exemption.
QUESTION?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION s

That's 107, isn't it.
Yes, that's 107.
How do you reconcile that with your answer

to Mr. Justice Marshall whon you said that they could levy a
tax on the sales made in the Officers Club.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, tales made in the Officers Club

are not at issue her© because we do have a regulation which
exempts the military clubs.

This is the same regulation they

complain about, exempts all the sales they make from retail
sales taxes, that's a 5 percent tax, and the regulation also
exempts the clubs, exempts the clubs from the gallonage tax
that th© State imposes on retailers for the privilege of making
retail sales.

Those taxes on

those privileges the military

clubs are exempted from.
Wow, this tax, the wholesaler's tax is levied on a
business that those clubs don't engage in; it is levied on the
business of making wholesale sales of liquor in Mississippi
and distributed in Mississippi.

That’s

a function that the

34
military clubs do not perform, the fees is not laid on them;
it is laid on the distillers whom the State permits fee perform
it.

Now, that is the situation where yon don’t -QUESTION:

As far as that goes, the ultimate burden, of course,

MR. WRIGHT:

As he should, Justice Brenner says,

MR. WRIGHT:

That much is clear with respect to any

QUESTION:

I am sure he is restricting that to whisky.

MR. WRIGHTs

Wow, I just want to say a word about

this alleged conflict between the Federal procurement policy
and the State's policy.

Now, tills regulation, the military

regulation we are talking about, is one which does not even
purport to implemont the Armed Services Procurement Act.
It's a regulation issued under the Draft Extension Act, the
act extending the manpower draft, in 1951, which doesn't
mention taxes, doesn't say anything about standards for the
Federal procurement of suppXies.
Now, one thing more I wanted to — there is, there
is therefore no Federal statute that is in conflict with
anything the State is doing here.

There is one thing more

I want to add, that the military'3 own regulation provides that
these retailers can't sell at prices more than 10 percent
lower than what the civilian retailers in the same area are
charging.

So that the only effect of giving the military an

even lower price than what they now get would simply to b© to
increase the profits of the military retailers at the expense
of State revenues.
Now, only one thing more I want to point out, as
far as the Constitution is concerned, there certainly is no
conflict between the 10th Amendment and the supremacy clause.
The 10th Amendment is now the State source of taxing pothers.
States have been taxing, putting excise taxes on sales of
liquor ever since they were colonies.

The first on© was laid

37
by the Massachusetts colony in 1©46, and at the time the
Constitution was adopted, revenue from liquor sales was an
important source of revenue for all those States.
What you are talking about here is not depriving the
United States of any right it may have to tax liquor.
can tax liquor for its purposes.

It, too,

But what the Government is

arguing here is that the State cannot tax liquor sales that
are made to these military clubs, although this whole wholesale
excise taxation is historically a right they were exercising
and it was preserved to them when the 10th Amendment was
adopted .

If the 10th Amendment means anything at all today,,

it certainly means that the State's right to tax liquor was
not impaired by any other provisions of the Constitution.
I want to say one word about the Agricultural Bank
case.

As counsel pointed out, it is not a constitutional

tax immunity holding; it has really nothing to do, as X see
it, with the problem you are presented here, which deals with
the taxation of liquor and rests on an entirely different
base than the taxation of national banks.
Maryland

What McCulloch v«

did, of course, was Maryland did try to impose a

tax on the creation of currency by the Bank of the United
States.

They wanted the State banks to have the only right to

create currency.

Thatfs the kind of State tax that very clearly

impairs a Federal function.
involved here at all.

And there is no such impairment

The tax has been laid on these wholesale

sales, doesn't .prevent these military clubs from doing anything
that they are authorised and expected to do, buy and sell
liquor cheaper

than anyone else and earn a profit on the sale.

That's

Essentially what it's pointed at is

that if the legal incidence of the tax is on the wholesaler,
assuming arguendo, then you have a situation where the whole­
saler is told by the State of Mississippi, if you sell to us,
the State, you don't have to pay any tax; if you sell to the
Government, you've got to pay a tax.
Now, the Court has held in Phillips v. Dumas School

Also, you separately argue that it would

MR. SMITH:

Yes, absolutely.

And this is an

extraordinary situation where the State cf Mississippi is
telling the Federal Government, "You have to buy a commodity
at a price that we are setting, and in any event, we are
also going to tell you — we limit your sources of supply."
If you look at page 63 of the appendix, the State
of Mississippi Alcoholic Beverage Control Division wrote a
letter to all vendors which said, "The choice is granted feo the
purchasing direct from the distiller (and they are underlining)
or from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the State
Tax Commission. Purchases are not to be placed with any other
source."

This is an extraordinary situation where a State

is telling the Federal Government that its choice with respect

as well as in terms of price.

and ensures to the host of its ability that those commodities
which come in, including alcoholic beverages, will not be
diverted to the civilian population.
