PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Gentlemen, we can

resume arguments in Breed against Jones.
Mr. Walker, you have 22 minutes remaining,
QUESTION:

Mr. Walker, I am not certain whether

under the California system there might be a transferal
proceedings without first having an adjudicatory proceeding.
May there or not?
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:

Well, certainly.
Does that happen?
Yes.

As a matter

of fact, in 1972,

the California Supreme Court, in a case called Donald L.,
which is cited in our brief, stated that the preferred
practice in California is to hold a fitness hearing before
the adjudicatory hearing so not only does that happen, that
is now the customary practice in California.
It is not required, as a matter of statutory law,
but in the great majority of cases pursuant to that
California Supreme Court decision, that is -QUESTION:

Well,' when that practice is followed,

does that avoid this issue?
MR. WALKER:

That completely avoids the double

jeopardy problem.
QUESTION:

Well, it doesnft If they keep juris­

diction and adjudicate them and then the Youth Authority

38
rejects it* turns him back.
MR. WALKER:

Well, that doesn't bear on the question

of whether the fitness hearing should come before or after
the jurisdictional hearing.
QUESTION:

Exactly, but having it before doesn't

cure that problem.
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

No., that is a separate problem.
No, but if you have the fitness hearing

and it is decided at the fitness hearing to transfer, then
there is never any juvenile adjudication.
MR. WALKER:

That is correct.

There is never any

adjudication.
QUESTION:

And we don’t have this double jeopardy

problem.
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

Correct/
Well, then, why —• what I am trying to

get to is, why should we ever have a double jeopardy problem?
Why don’t they always have the fitness hearing
first?
MR. WALKER:
fitness hearing first.

I think they should always have a
It just so happens that in this case

they decided to hold the jurisdictional hearing first and I
don’t think there is any justification for that procedure.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Brennan, all of
the authorities in the juvenile area, Including the National

39
Council on Juvenile Court Judges, the National Council on
Crime and Delinquency and all of the model statutes and acts
which address this question, state that the preferred
practice from the standpoint of the best procedure for the
juvenile and juvenile court is

to hold the fitness hearing

first.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it, at the fitness hearing,

if he has had a prior record, the judge who presides at
the fitness hearing learns <o"f~~i'he prior record.
MR. WALKER:

That is true.

QUESTION:

And then suppose he decides not to

transfer and then proceeds to the jurisdictional hearing,
knowing of the fellow’s past record?
Are there any problems raised by that?
MR. WALKER:

Yes.

What the California Supreme

Court has said in that instance is that the judge must
disqualify himself.
QUESTION:

And transfer to another jmge.

MR. WALKER:

And that is not a serious problem

in California nor is it a serious problem in most juris­
dictions.

" "

• -

In California the juvenile court is just a branch
of the Superior Court so it is a very simple matter for
another Superior Court judge to come in and hear the matter.
QUESTION:

Surely there must be counties up in

those northern counties in your state, though, that don't
have so many Superior Court judges in a county.
MR. WALKER:

That is correct.

There are some small

little counties that might only have one superior court judge.
QUESTION:

Right.

I®. WALKER:

However, in California, we have a

procedure where a Superior Court judge can. be disqualified
without cause and so it is very common that judges from
adjoining counties come in and sit on those cases.
QUESTION:

It is something of a burden in counties

QUESTION:

Trumble.

QUESTION;

— the Sierra Counties and counties

where you only have one
MR. WALKER:
be a burden.

Superior Court judge.
Yes, there is no question that it would

I don't think that it would be an insuperable

burden or even a considerable burden.
I doubt that those counties account for very many
transfer hearings.

t

As I mentioned yesterday, only one percent of the
delinquency cases result in transfer and a great majority of
those cases come from the urban counties.
QUESTION:

Well, we are talking about cases in

which there is not a transfer.
We are talking about the 99 percent of the cases

41
where there is a jurisdictional hearing and not a transfer.
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

Correct.
I mean a transfer hearing and not a

transfer.
MR. WALKER:

Yes.

But my statement would also

apply to those cases as well.

QUESTION:

Well, except it is 99 percent, not one

percent.
MR. WALKER:

Well, no, I don’t think that is true.

The 99 percent of the cases would not involve
transfer hearings.

That is a very,very small percent of the

cases in California in which there is a transfer hearing
because, for example, a minor must be over the age of 16.
If any minor is over the age of 16, it cannot be
a transfer hearing.
v

QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:

If he is under 16.
Under 16, excuse me.

And in addition,

xn most cases where the minor is not charged with a serious
offense, where he does not have a previous records a trans­
fer would not even be considered as a possibility.
QUESTION:

Do you have any statistics as to the

percentage of total juvenile cases and the percentage of -—
in those that have transfer hearings?
MR. WALKER:

Unfortunately, the only — the

statistics we have go to the number of cases that are

42

actually transferred.
QUESTION:
'

MR. WALKER:

Rather than where they have the hearings.
That is correct.

There was one point which came up during argument
yesterday that I think bears some clarification.
We are not contending, of course, that the jeopardy
attached at the fitness hearing.

We are saying that jeopardy

attached at the trial in the juvenile court which is called
the jurisdictional hearing and at the trial in the adult
c ourt.
And, of course, this Court has held in Collins
against Loisel that jeopardy does not attach at a preliminary
hearing because that hearing does not involve an adjudication
of guilt.
Similarly, jeopardy would not attach at a fitness
hearing nor would jeopardy attach, for example, at a penalty
hearing In a death penalty case if that hearing would be in
the nature of a sentencing or disposition hearing rather
than an adjudicatory hearing.
This does not mean that evidence relating to the
offense would be inadmissible at the fitness hearing.

It

simply means that that evidence would be only relevant to
the question of whether the minor should, be retained in the
juvenile system or transferred to the adult system.
i

Now, Petitioner relies quite heavily upon this

^3
so-called ’’theory of continuing jeopardys" and as I under­
stand that theory, it insists that the initial proceeding
m ust culminate in a final disposition of the case before
a second jeopardy could attach in the second prosecution.
Mow, just yesterday in an opinion issued by this
Court, United States against Jenkins, this Court, in a
unanimous opinion, rejected the broad type of continuing
jeopardy theory which has been espoused by Petitioner and
stated that that theory»which was originated in a dissenting
opinion by Justice Holmes in the Kepner case, has never
been adopted a majority of this Court.
QUESTION:

But in Kepner, the person had been

found innocent originally, hadn't he?
MR* WALKER:

That is correct.

That was in appeal

xrom an acquittal but I think that the reasoning of Kepner
and a number of the other cases involving the continuing
jeopardy principles demonstrate that that principle is
limited to the situation where the prosecution

excuse

me, where the defendant has appealed and where there has
been a reversal on appeal and where there is a rsprosecution
after that reversal.
That is not the same situation as we have in this
case.

Gary Jones did not ask to be retried in adult court.
It is certainly arguably fair in the case of --

in a case where a defendant actually asks for his prosecution

44
to be reversed, for the people to vindicate their rights
by retrying him if, indeed, he does obtain the reversal
which he sought.
But here we have an entirely different situation,
a case where the reversal was not initiated or sought by the
defendant.

Now, it is not —
QUESTION:

I gather that California, the Supreme

Court has adopted the continuing jeopardy theory, at least
for purposes of the California Constitution and also, in
Bryan, ruled on it for purposes of the Federal Constitution.
MR. WALKER:

Yes, that is true.

They have

accepted the continuing jeopardy theory in this context.
i

Now, it seems to me that the continuing jeopardy
theory, at least this broad type of continuing jeopardy theory
,£• v7 t

espoused by Petitioner, is inconsistent with a number of
decisions by this Court in a whole line of eases where this
Court has held that where an initial prosecution is aborted,
for example, by a mistrial brought about by the prosecutor
or improperly by the Court that there, even though there has
not been a final culmination of the initial proceeding,
nevertheless, jeopardy attaches for the purpose of barring
the second prosecution.
If this Court were to reverse the Ninth Circuit
in this case, I would suggest that it would be undermining a
number of decisions and very basic policies that are

45
fundamental to double jeopardy protection.
QUESTION:
adult cases.

Well, all those cases, of course are

I take it, our approach, due to the applica­

tion of the juvenile system of some of the guaranties that
otherwise are applied in adult prosecution, we have to take
into account, don't we, the special values of the juvenile
system and the extent to which applying those double jeopardy
principles to the juvenile system may impair its effective­
ness?
MR. WALKER:

Well, I am not certain that you have

to take that into account for the reason that this —
QUESTION:

Well, we certainly did as to the jury

ti^ial in McKsiver.
MR. WALKER *
QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:

lea,
And Winship suggested that, didn't it?
Yes, the difference between this

case and Winship, GAult and McKeiver is that in this case
the minor has been convicted in adult court of a felony
and suffers from all the disabilities of a felony conviction
that any* other person in California would suffer, whether
he is a juvenile or an adult.
QUESTION:

What I am thinking of particularly is

the determination whether or not we should or shouldn't,
for this purpose, adopt a continuing jeopardy theory.
MR. WALKER:

Well, what I am suggesting, Mr, Justice

Brennans is that; if1 you adopted a continuing .jeopardy theory
in this case on the theory that this is a juvenile case , but
I think you would ~ of necessity, it would also be applied
in the adult court context because this minor suffers all
the same disabilities that any adult would suffer who has
been convicted of a felony.
Under California law, Gary Jones, for example,
cannot have his records sealed, whereas if he were adjudicated
delinquent, he would have the right to have that —QUESTION:

But your California court thought that,

that holding in Bryan thought that, saying that there was
double jeopardy in this sort of a situation would undermine
the juvenile system in the sense that judges would be less —
.more likely to transfer to adult courts and to. — to direct
out of the juvenile system more or a larger percentage of
the juvenile cases.
MR. WALKER:

I agree that the California Supreme

\

\

Court made that statement.

I would suggest, Mr. Justice

White, that
QUESTION:

Well, you know more about how your

system works than we do.
MR. WALKER:

Yes, but it is the same California

Supreme Court which, interestingly enough, held in Donald L.
that the procedure that we are advocating is the preferred
procedure.

I would suggest that that statement in Bryan

47
was colored by the —
QUESTION:

Well, I think that is consistent — I

think that is consistent enough because just because this
would be the preferred procedure and you'd hold the transfer
hearing first wouldn’t avoid the double jeopardy problem
that arose in Bryan.
MR. WALKER:
statement in

Right.

I think that the California

Bryan really was founded upon the peculiar

factual situation where the minor had actually been sent to
the California Youth Authority and was transferred back to
juvenile court because they decided he — they didn’t have
enough time to rehabilitate him and he was incorrigible and
then they decided, even though he had already begun his
treatment program as a juvenile, to transfer him

for another

prosecution.
Now, I would suggest that is perhaps an even
the
more flagrant violation of/double jeopardy guarantee than
we have in this case.
QUESTION:

Well', I would think you would, yes,

and I would also think, however, if you upheld that, this
one would be afortiorari.
MR. WALKER:

Yes, I agree,

I obviously don’t agree with the Bryan decision.
But turning to some of these policy reasons
concerning the juvenile court which you brought up.

48
Mr. Justice Brennan, it is our position that if you apply the
double jeopardy protection in this context, you will actually
be enhancing the fundamental fairness of the juvenile court
system, whereas in McKeiver, the Court felt that that system
would be threatened.
For one thing, this Court has frequently emphasized
the absolute necessity of the juvenile court system operating
in an informal manner and by an informal manner, I think that
what was meant was that in most juvenile cases, the juvenile,
if he is indeed guilty, will come in and admit his trans­
gression.
There will not be the necessity of a formal adversary
hearing with counsel and all the other trappings and then the
Court will get on with its primary business, which is to
rehabilitate the juvenile.
Novr, that policy goal of informality is really
largely frustrated if the juvenile contests the petition and
decides to stand trial.
In that case, he will be represented by counsel.
There will be & formal adversary hearing.
Now, I would point out that if you hold the
jurisdictional hearing first, the minor does not at that point
know whether he is going to be retained

in the juvenile

system or ultimately transferred to the adult court system.
So he will, as a consequence, be extremely

reluctant to admit his guilt — as a result of that admis­
sion, he may later find himself in state prison.
Indeed, the volume on juvenile court practice
which has been published by the California State Bar to
advise juvenile court practitioners on how to handle these
kinds of cases advises counsel not to encourage the minor
to talk freely with

the probation officer until he knows

whether the juvenile will be retained in the juvenile system
or transferred.
So that policy goal will be totally frustrated if
you don't hold a fitness hearing first.
Secondly, the juvenile will be kept in a
continuing state of anxiety-insecurity unless you hold
the certification hearing or transfer hearing initially.
We believe that that from the rehabilitative point
of view it is extremely vital

that the juvenile know

whether he is going to be treated as a juvenile or as an
adult.
has
Certainly, this Court/found that the appearance
as well as the actuality of fairness is crucial in terms of
the rehabilitation of the juvenile and from the standpoint of
a minor, he can’t very well feel that he is being dealt with
fairly if he is being exposed to a double prosecution which
he knows has been held to be repugnant in the case of even
the most hardened criminals.

50
QUESTION:

But in this fitness hearing, is the

juvenile not going to be reticent about discussing the details
of his conduct for fear if he does discuss it, it will lead
to his transfer?
MR, WALKER:
QUESTION:

That is a possibility, your Honor«
Isn’t it a very great likelihood?

More than a possibility?
MR, WALKER:

Well --

QUESTION: If he thirte that the truth of the
matter will have an adverse impact on the judge in terms of
making the decision to send him to an adult court, if he is
either very

bright or well advised, he is not going to talk.

Isn’t that right?
MR, WALKER:

That may be true but I would hasten

to point out that after that fitness hearing is conducted,
and if the judge determines to retain the minor in the
juvenile system, then the minor will rather freely, In most
instances, discuss his case with the juvenile probation
officer after-QUESTION:

After the decision of fitness has been

made,■
MR, WALKER:

Right,

And the decision on the fitness

would be made at a very early point in the proceedings,
As X pointed out, it is not a full trial and
normally, it would be made rather soon after the juvenile is

51
taken into custody by the probation department.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walker, I still can’t quite

visualize how you avoid having what , in effect, is a full
adversary trial if the juvenile and his counsel wish to
have it.
I think you agreed yesterday that he would be
entitled to counsel.
You are representing the juvenile at a fitness
hearing.

The juvenile persuades you that he didn’t commit

whatever the offense may be with which he is charged.
If you do your duty as a lawyer, wouldn’t you try
to produce witnesses to satisfy the juvenile judge if you
bought there was a chance of transfer, that he had not
committed the offense arid wouldn’t the state then put on
his witnesses to refute your testimony and wouldn't it all
end up being an adversary hearing?
I-IR. ) WALKER:

No, Mr. Justice Powell, I do not

believe so.
I have seen a number of transcripts from California
where, Indeed, the juvenile’s counsel had put on some
evidence but that evidence normally will be character
Witnesses or evidence about a juvenile's rehabilitation.
occasionally, in a rare case, a counsel may even
produce someone from the California Youth Authority to
testify that this juvenile can be dealt with as a juvenile.

52

It is extz*emely rare and unusual — in

fact, I’ve

never seen the case in California where a juvenile would put
on a defense at the fitness hearing.
’

For one thing, he realises that he will have an

opportunity to put on that defense later and he doesn’t want
to tip his hand, so to speak, to reveal his entire defense to
the prosecution at that early stage.
I

.have even seen cases where the court has

refused to hear evidence going to jurisdictioni&l facts,
stating that that was irrelevant under California law.
QUESTION:

If a judge took that position, would

that nullify the effectiveness or the validity of the transfer
hearing?’ ''Suppose a judge just said, I am not going to hear
any evidence that pertains as to whether or not the juvenile
committed the offense.
MR, WALKER:

Well, I think that some of — I don’t

think that it would negate it.
question of the juvenile’s

I think there Is still the

particular amenability to treat­

ment programs available through the juvenile court.
I think that in most instances, the judge would
"\

allow in some evidence pertaining to the tome, such as he
may want to consider whether the crime was of a particularly
heinous character or whether it is a very serious type of
offense but in most instances, the judge will say if the
juvenile is charged for murder, if he is charged with a

53
robbery or a rape.
That is a serious crime and that is enough., from
the standpoint of the California statute.
I point out that in California the legislature has
not written any probable cause requirements into the fitness
statute, which they could have done, which has been done in
some states.
QUESTION:

What is the practice, Mr. Walker?

purely, there must be some evidence before there
is a determination that he is to be transferred, that he
did commit some crime, isn’t there?
MR. WALKER:

The evidence that normally Is

introduced is the police report.
be some other evidence.

Occasionally there might

The police report is admissible

at fitness hearing in California because hearsay is allowed
to come in.
QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:

Well, what does that establish?
That establishes that so-and-so, you

know, says —
QUESTION:

Something more than just the charge,

isn’t it?
MR. WALKER:

That is correct and normally in

California, that is considered to be sufficient.
This may seem to be a peculiar procedure, but it
Is the procedure which is adopted in the great majority of

jurisdictions which — only three jurisdictions in the entire
United States require a showing of delinquency prior to a
transfer and there are some other jurisdictions which require
a showing of probable cause but the gr@at majority of
jurisdictions require neither at the fitness hearing.
QUESTIONS:

How many jurisdictions in addition to

California provide for a transfer hearing after a finding of
delinquehcy?
MR, WALKER:

Well, there are three jurisdictions

which require that the delinquency hearing be held first,
Massachusetts, West Virginia and Alabama.
'

••

^

There are 19 jurisdictions that require the fitness
hearing to be held first and it is a little bit questionable
*

about what is required in the- other jurisdictions.
v't

QUESTIONS:
California,

But the others seem to be like

They are permitted to come in either order.

MR. WALKER:

Permitted either way.

However, it

would seem, first of all, from the absence of cases challenging
procedure on double jeopardy grounds and also from the fact of
the legislatures have not even required — in some juris­
dictions, probable cause requirement or in other jurisdictions,
the delinquency finding.
But the usual practice in those jurisdictions is
to hol4 the fitness hearing first and that is recommended, as
I have said, by all of the legal commentators except one, by

55
all of the model codes.
QUESTION:

Well, the writer of the article in

the University of Toledo Law Review disagrees with you.
MR. WALKER:

That is the one commentator that I

was referring to, yes, Professor Carr.
QUESTION:

Just so I have it straight, when do you

say that jeopardy attaches here?

At the beginning of the

hearing or at the end of it or when he was adjudicated?
MR. WALKER:

Well, our position is, the jeopardy

attaches at the jurisdictional hearing in juvenile court
when the .first witness is sworn and begins to testify and
that, likewise -QUESTION:

/

That is at the adjudicatory hearing.
\

MR. WALKER:

Right, the adjudicatory hearing..

And that jeopardy then attaches in criminal proceedings also when the first witness is sworn and begins to
testify.
QUESTION:

But it wouldn’t — and so the judge,

if he even starts the adjudicatory hearing, according to
you must either keep him in juvenile court or dismiss him.
MR. WALKER:

That is right and the experts tell us

that there is absolutely no reason why that decision can’t
be reached before the adjudicatory hearing and, as I pointed
out, this is the practice in 19 of the 22 jurisdictions
which require the hearing to be held at either one point or

56

another.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Walker.

Thank you, gentlemen, the case Is submitted.
