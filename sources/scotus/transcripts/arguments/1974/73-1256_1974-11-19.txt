MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

n (1 Q
We will hear arguments

next in 73-1256, Connell against Plumbers and Sfceamfitters
Local 100.
Mr. Canterbury, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH F. CANTERBURY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CANTERBURY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Your Honors, this case involves the antitrust issues
involved in an agreement between a Plumbers Union and a general
contractor in Dallas, Texas, whereby the general contractor
has been coerced into an agreement that he will refuse to do
business with and will boycott all subcontractors for
mechanical work unless those subcontractors in earn have a
collective bargaining agreement with the Union.
Your Honors» this case involves in no manner an
employee-employer relationship.

The petitioner in the case,

Connell Construction Company, does not have and never has had
a single employee represented by the respondent Union.
The district court below did not decide the anti­
trust issues in the agreement, but held that the proviso to
Section 8(e) of the Taft-Hartley Act protected the agreement.
The Fifth Circuit, in turn, found that the Union’s

4
actions were antitrust exempt, but failed to decide any of
the labor questions.
The Union filed for a declaratory judgment, that
the agreement was protected by the construction industry
proviso to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act.
I would point out, Your Honors, that the Fifth
Circuit, in very strong words, admonished the National
Labor Relations Act, to decide the labor issues involved in
the case at the next available opportunity, which has not
been done, even though the Board in this case has filed an
amicus brief where they admit that the issue of the
construction industry proviso to Section 8(e) of the TaftHartley Act has never been decided by the Board, outside of
an employer-employee relationship.
The facts quickly are that Connell Construction
Company is a general contractor in the construction business
in Dallas, Texas.
Connell obtains its work by competitive bidding,
Connell in turn subcontracts mechanical work by
competitive bidding.
Connell is involved in interstate commerce.
The mechanical portion of any construction project
can equal 40 to 50 percent of the project.

Indeed, on pox^er

plants, generating plants, it can equal more than that.
Mechanical construction normally includes all of

5

the piping, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and
plumbing.

In fact, in some of our very sophisticated air-

conditioning systems today it even includes computers.
It includes the major portion of any construction
project.
The Union, respondent, in December of 1970, sent a
letter to Connell saying, "We want you to enter into an
agreement with us that you will refuse to do business" —
I’m paraphrasing the agreement ■— "you will not do business
with any mechanical subcontractor unless they have an agree­
ment with us, a collective bargaining agreement.’'
QUESTION;

Did Connell have any general policy of

limiting its calls for bids to non-union contractors?
MR. CANTERBURY;

No, Your Honor, not at all.

Mr.

Chief Justice, the record shows that over the past 23 years
Connell has, on a recurring basis, done business with both
union and open-shop mechanical contractors.
In fact, at the time that the Union sent the letter,
and the agreement, and subsequently started picketing for the
agreement, Connell indeed had a union contractor who had a
collective bargaining agreement with the union on the job.
Connell ■—- the record clearly shows that Connell
up until this time did not care what the labor policy of his
subcontractors was.

He admittedly is in a competitive

business, and he looks for competitive bids from qualified

6

contractors.
And when the picketing — after Connell failed to
sign the agreement, the Union commenced picketing about one
of Connell’s projects, where there was a union subcontractor?
about 150 men on the picket line brought construction to a
halt.
Connell filed an action in the State court in
Texas, alleging that the agreement was violative of the
antitrust laws of the State of Texas? a restraining order
was issued, the case was removed to federal court, at which
time Connell amended his pleadings and alleged not only

the

violations of the antitrust laws of Texas but also of the
Sherman Act.
Your Honors, the -- as to whether or not the Union
has been a party and has been cause of a violation of the
Sherman Act will turn upon the extent of a union's immunity
from the labor laws.
I think, if you can — if we can look at the
agreement on its face, the agreement on its face is simply an
agreement between two parties;

a union and a non-labor

party, Connell, whereby agreement is reached that Connell
will not do business with other people — not just one sub­
contractor but every mechanical contractor from Dallas to the
Oklahoma border, who does not have a collective bargaining
agreement with the Union, for any reason.

7
The Union did not seek to protect wages, working
conditions.

The evidence shows no tiling as to what open-shop

or non-union subcontractors pay their employees.
QUESTION;

fir. Canterbury, I gather it’s not just a

contract between an employer and the union, it's a contract
betweman employer and the union and the construction
industry.
MR. CANTERBURY; Correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And there are special statutory

provisions that govern contracts of that kind, aren't there?
MR. CANTERBURY;

Your Honor, you're referring to the

proviso to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act.
QUESTION;

I think you have to deal with that, don't

you?
MR. CANTERBURY;
Honor.

Yes.

I will deal with that, Your

I certainly will.

' '

But, on the face of the agreement, on its face, it’s
clearly a restraint of trade.

It clearly violates the

Sherman Act, unless the Union is exempt.
Nov;, let's look as to whether or not the Union's
actions are exempt.

I'm well aware and we all are, of course,

of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the Clayton Act and the
exemptions which they grant to unions from certain — for
certain activities, not all, from the antitrust laws.
The first theory is the conspiracy theory.

It's

8

been held, from Allen Bradley and numerous cases since then,
til at if a union conspires with a non-labor group or source
to restrain trade, then they’re just like anyone else,
they’re just like two businessmen if they enter into an
agreement to restrain trade, if the union enters into a
conspiracy.
Your Honor, the conspiracy in this case is twofold,
and I must step back into the facts

at one important point.

Prior to the time that the union came to Connell,
they entered into a multi-employer agreement with the largest
unionised mechanical contractors in the Dallas area.
That agreement contained a favored-nations clause
which prohibited the union from giving any employer any
better terms or conditions than was contained in the multi­
employer group, in that contract.
The business agent, at the trial of the case,
testified — I asked him;

Suppose Connell wanted to do

business with a subcontractor, a mechanical contractor, who
was not a party to your collective bargaining agreement, could
that mechanical contractor come in and negotiate one?
The business agent said;

No, he can only sign

our established agreement.
That’s the only agreement someone can sign.
Now, the Union, since this case was argued at the
Fifth Circuit, the Union has dropped its favored-nations

9

clause from its master agreement.

I submit that the facts

are still the same, that, the union only has one form of
collective bargaining agreement? that's the master area agree­
ment.
Now, who are the benefactors of this conspiracy?
Connell is a conspirator, he's an unwilling conspirator,
clearly umtfilling; but the benefactors are the mechanical
contractors who were a party to the Union's collective
bargaining agreement, the master area agreement.
If Connell is restricted, and Connell is just one
contractor of meaning in the area, if general contractors are
restricted from subcontracting out work to open-shop
mechanicals, of course the union mechanicals are the
benefectors.
I believe that indeed a conspiracy by the Union,
first making this agreement with the unionised contractors
and then coming to Connell and insisting that Connell place
all those with whom he does business under the same agreement,
that that is a conspiracy.

Connell is a link.

Connell and

other general contractors are the method in which it's
transmitted.
But even beyond that, Connell, even though he doesn't
get a bit of benefit, and although he's an unwilling
conspirator, he's a non-labor party.

And the agreement

clearly restrains trade outside of any employer-employee

10

relationship,
I believe that the — even if there is no
conspiracy,, we must look to see whether or not the Onion and
whether or not this agreement fosters a legitimate union
interest.
Thic Court's decision in Jewell Tea clearly held
that even if there is nc conspiracy and if a labor-management
agreement involves restraints of trade, the inquiry does not
stop with conspiracy.

You look at the agreement, you look

at the effects, and you compare it with national labor
policy.
Indeed, Your Honors, from as far back as the
Danbury Hatters case, Hutcheson, Apex, Allen Bradley, every
labor antitrust case which has come before this Court,
the agreement that is found in restraint of trade has been
compared against national labor policy, and I think that’s
what must be done in this case.
The agreement must be compared against the national
labor policy, which is primarily found in the Taft-Hartley
Act.
Even harder, and one that I accept, is the NorrisLaGuardia Act.

I believe comparing the agreement v/ith the

Norris-LaGuardia Act itself shows that this type of an
agreement is not legitimate labor activity.

The Norris-

LaGuardia Act talks in terms of fostering collective bargaining,

3.1
fostering the rights of employees.
The Taft-Hartley Act in 947, the entire preamble
of the Act is to foster collective bargaining and for employees
to be free to choose their own representatives.
The Act does not favor unionism nor non™unionism,
it doesn't favor unions or employers; the Act favors the rights
of the employees to select.
Let's look at what this agreement and what the
effects of it do to, first, Connell:
with Connell.
agreement said:

The Union has no dispute

The letter they sent to Connell seeking this
We don't want to represent a single one of

your employees.
They have no dispute whatsoever with Connell.
Their dispute, alleged dispute, is with open-shop
mechanical contractors, which Connell didn't have at the time
this whole — all of this picketing started.
When they went to picket the project, Connell being
a neutral employer — that was a clearcut secondary boycott.
Clearly.
Further, he's being enmeshed in a dispute that is
not his. And that's what the whole purpose, one of the main
purposes of our Labor Act has been, is to protect neutral
employers.
Let's look at the Section 7 rights of the employees
of mechanical construction firms with whom Connell must boycott.

12

Where do their rights lie?

Section 7 of the Taft-IIarfciey Act

says they've got the right to choose their own representa­
tives, to bargain collectively through representatives of
their own choosing, to engage in protected activities,, or to
refrain from union activities»
Let's look at these employees.
have?

They have none at all.

What rights do they

As this type of an agreement

that is involved in this case becomes broader and broader,
they have no choice, their employer must sign up with the
respondent union or go out of business.
It doesn't make any difference if they voted for
another union, if they voted against the union, or if they
just don't want to belong to a union; they don't have a
thing to say about it.
construction market.

Because the local union controls the
Either you sign up with them or you

don't get work.
Because if the general contractors who award the
work are unable to subcontract, then they get no work.
Those rights are obliterated.
Section 9 of the Act gives the employees the right
to an election.

They have no rights to an election.

I submit, and it's set forth in our brief, Your
Honor, that if you compare this agreement to the Labor Act,
you will find that indeed it is violative of numerous provisions
of the Act, and against its main purposes, to foster collective

13
bargaining.
Let's look at that and go back:

Is this a legitimate

union interest?
Is it a legitimate union interest outside of the
employer-employee relationship to enforce a boycott of the
proportions which is involved in this case?
I submit that it's not.

There is no way this

agreement when compared with the Taft-Hartlev Act can measure
up to be legitimate.
Now, it is always — anything that a union does for
its members, or that benefits its members, I'm sure they will
categorize as a legitimate union interest.
I submit, let's look at how they achieve it.
The Taft-Hartley Act gives them ample ways to organize
subcontractors, mechanical contractors.

They can go out and

try to organize them, they can hold an election, let the
employees decide.
But it's this type of activity which goes right to
the source of the work,

the general contractor, and says:

You refuse to do business with anybody that doesn't have an
agreement with us.

Then it's become a clearcut restraint of

trade beyond any — no way, I think, we could find any legitimate
union interest in it.
Your Honors, the agrement also —• it's not limited
to any particular project, it has no limitation whatsoever.

14
It’s forever future,■ on any construction project in which the
general contractor is involved on.
Mow, I would like to direct your attention to the
union's sole defense to this

case, and that is Section 8(e)

of the National Labor Relations Act.
The Union has taken the position that Section 8(e),
which was enacted in '59 to outlaw hot cargo agreements,
protects this agreement.
Your Honors, when the Act was amended in '59, it
came about because, really, of two reasons.

I think that we

must trace very quickly the history and whac brought about
8(e) .
We first go to two cases, Denver Building Trades,
this Court decided in 1954, which clearly distinguished
between the general contractor and the subcontractor as
separate employers at the construction project.
This type of an agreement obliterates that decision.
If a union can radiate these disputes from -- with a
particular subcontractor and say, No, we've got a dispute
with the contractor.

We've got a primary dispute.

All it takes is changing the wording on their
picket sign and Denver Building Trades is gone.
That's what happened in this case.
Okay.

Then we must go to the Sand Door case, decided

by this Court in 1958.

In Sand Door it-was held that a hot

15

cargo clause was no defense to a secondary boycott.

But the

Court stated that if an employer atnd a union,, it voluntarily
agreed to a boycott., that it’s not a violation of the secondary
boycott ban if it’s free of coercion, if it’s voluntary.
That decision is what led to the enactment of 3(e),
to the Taft-IIartley Act.

Congress wanted to overrule that

loophole, which they considered loophole, in the Sand Door
decision of this Court.
Nov;, when the amendments went in in '59 they were
hotly contested.

Some Congressmen and Senators wanted to

outlaw hot cargo agreements in all industries and introduced
bills to that effect.
On the other hand, a group wanted to overrule Denver
Building Trades, and they wanted to wipe out all prohibitions
against secondary picketing at the site of construction.
The bills that were designed to overrule Building
Trades, Denver Building Trades, were rejected by both Houses
of Congress.

The bills passed by the Senate and the House

contain no special rules for the construction industry.
The bills went to conference.

And out of the conference

report we find that a proviso was added for the construction
industry.
The proviso to Section 8(e); Section 8(e) outlawing
all hot cargo agreements, for proviso for agreements at the
site of construction.

And on the face of the proviso one would

16

believe that, well, it could cover any agreement at the site
of construction.
Your Honors, when you read that legislative history,
it's set forth in our briefs, and I believe I've read every
page of it. the legislative history overwhelmingly shows that
Congress intended several things about the proviso:
One, that it only apply to voluntary agreements,
not coercive agreements.

When Senator Kennedy reported

back to the Senate from a conference re?^ort, he said that the
proviso to 8(e) is not intended to change the law with
repsect to picketing at a construction site.
Building Trades is still good 1aw.

That Denver

That Sand Door is good law.

That the proviso was to preserve the status quo.

In other

words, what was legal to a construction industry union
prior to '59 remained legal.
They came out with nothing more.
And what — all they had which was brought out in
Sandor was the right to enter into a voluntary boycott
agreement.
Congressman Barden reported back to the House,
said it just preserves the status quo.
That legislative history indicates to me, and I
believe it will to you, that it envisioned an employeremployee relationship, frot agreements made outside of the
employer-employee relationship.

17
Congress never in their wildest dreams would have
figured that we

could do so. That would have wiped out for

tiie construction industry, which is what ’tills agreement: Goes,
all of the secondary boycott bans, all of the employee rights
under Section 7.

It runs contrary to the whole Act.

They meant an employer-employee relationship.
QUESTION:

Mr. Canterbury, when you say —

MR. CANTERBURY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr, Justice —

— when you say they meant an employer-

employee relationship, do I understand you to mean that it was
intended that under the proviso, the first proviso of Section
8(e), that-such an agreement would be exempt from the language
cf 8(e) only if the union that was making the agreement was
the bargaining representative of employees with the contractor
with whom it was making the agreement?
MR. CANTERBURY: That’s exactly what I mean, Your
Honor o
QUESTION:

Is that what you mean?

MR. CANTERBURY;
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Unh-hunh.

MR. CANTERBURY:

Only, and another thing, too, when

we go back and we really look at the antitrust implications,
8(e) grants no exemption from antitrust.

The proviso simply

says that it shall not be a violation of this clause 8(e).
Congress — and let’s look at the other exemption,

IS
just for comparison, with the garment industry exemption.
There was another exemption from the hot cargo clause in the
garment industry, the second proviso in 8(e).
they say:

In that one

for purpose of this Section 8(e) and 8(b)(4) —

the secondary boycott bans — the garment industry, and so
forth, is exempt.
The construction industry was not exempted from the
secondary boycott bans.
Your Honors, there is no case, and the Fifth
Circuit — there's not much in that majority opinion I do
agree with, but I do agree with this ~ that there is no
case ever been decided on the extent of 8(e), the priviso,
outside of the employer-employee relationship.
The National Labor Relations Board has admitted,
Footnote 10, page 9 of their brief in this case, — I’m glad
they filed that brief, because I had read so many of their
cases looking for it, and I never did -— that the NLRB has
never decided the issue.
And I would be less than candid with this Court if
I didn't tell you, and I'm sure you've read it in the briefs,
that the General Counsel of the NLRB, for reasons known
only to himself, refuses to issue a complaint.

I don't know

why he won't.
The Fifth Circuit pleaded with him, for the Board
to decide this question.

The Labor question.

I think that

19
you must decide it in order to properly decide the antitrust
questions.
policy.

We must compare the agreement with national labor

And when it’s compared —
QUESTION:

Well, ’the General Counsel has said why

he doesn’t file complaints, hasn't he?
MR. CANTERBURY:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

He said

— he has given his reasons.
QUESTION:

He says that 8(e) was intended to

preserve the status quo in the construction industry; that's
what he says.
MR. CANTERBURY;

Correct, Your Honor, but what the

--- let me just address myself to that quickly.

What the

General Counsel, which is his opinion —
QUESTION:

But what you said earlier -- perhaps I

misunderstood you -- I thought you said the General Counsel has
never explained why he won’t issue complaints in this case,
MR. CANTERBURY:

Oh, I beg your pardon.

mean to imply that, Your Honor.

I didn't

He's explained his reasons.

But I’m glad you raised that, I would like to address that.
His reasons, he says, is because it would preserve
the status quo.

I agree with that.

It was to preserve the

status quo.
What was the pattern of collective bargaining prior
to 1959 amendments?
I have found three cases where unions tried to obtain

20

the agreement outside of the employer-employee relationship
prior to '59.

And only three.

And all three of those cases held it was illegal.
They're cited at page 38 of my Brief on the Merits, Your
Honor, the blue one.

That was Texas Industries, Inc., Bangor

Building Trades, and Selby-Battersby Company.
Now, the Fifth Circuit —• I think this is very
important — they saw the issue, too, they saw that whether
or not they had been in practice prior to '59 would help
guide as to what Congress was doing, and they directed all
parties, including the Union, the AFL-CIO Building Trades
Department, all amicus to file supplemental briefs pointing
out any source showing the collective bargaining pattern in
the construction industry prior to '59.
Your Honors, not one agreement, not one type was
shown to the Fifth Circuit, and, indeed, Justice Clark in
his dissent stated that they were not even able to show one,
not one, much less a pattern.
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Richards.

Very well.

21
OPAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. RICHARDS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RICHARDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would for a moment like to define what we think to
be the issue and a relatively nolle issue before the Court.
The plaintiff’s complaint alleges only She mart Act
and State law violations; no contention was made under the
National Labor Relations Act under either Sections 301 or 303
in the trial court.

And in the trial court the only claim

was, as it's characterized in the Fifth Circuit opinion, that
Connell complained because the contract that was extracted from
Connell restricted its freedom to do business; that is, his
freedom to choose non-union subcontractors to perform his
mechanical work.
And, as I understand it, that's the issue today.
This contract, which is in evidence, stands alone,
it’s not in any way — or it's stripped of any allegations of
union-employer conspiracy.

The testimony at the trial court,

the findings there and the findings in the Fifth Circuit
characterize it as no allegation, no evidence of union-employer
conspiracy beyond that which Connell is unhappy about; that
is, his becoming an unwilling conspirator to what he deems to
be an unlawful purpose on the part of the union.
QUESTION:

Do you mean by that,Mr. Richards, that

22

there !s no Allen Bradley context?
MR. RICHARDS:

No Allen Bradley at all.

I take it this case is ~ the contract stands alone,
unlike Allen Bradley, where it stood as part of a much
broader conspiracy involving both the product market as well
as the labor market.
QUESTION: There's no allegation, in other words,
in the complaint that the union employers and the union
have conspired to gang up on Connell?
MR. RICHARDS:

None at all.

In fact, Connell's president or one of Connell's
witnesses, on cross-examination, disclaimed any such conten­
tion.

And that's where it stands.
QUESTION:

It's purely a complaint by Connell of

this agreement that was foisted on him by the Union?
MR. RICHARDS:

That's as I understand it.

That's

all.
That's all that was addressed in the trial court.
I will say that as the case got further along, the issue was
raised at the Circuit Court level about the most-favored
nations clause, but I don't think —■ realistically, it's
not in the case, Connell does not claim any injury by virtue
of the one-time existence of that clause.

The clause now

no longer exists.
This is a case in which the only relief sought was

23

declaratory and injunctive.

Hence, 1 suppose, to the extant

that even if it were in the case at some time, it has become,
1 suspect — X would say, moot.
QUESTION:

Declaratory and injunctive, Mr. Richsxds,

you mean by that —
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

No damage claim.

No damage claim.

Just to enjoin enforce­

ment of the contract?
MR. RICHARDS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And to enjoin, I

believe, attempts to secure it and enforce it.

Yes, Your

Honor.
We think — well, let me add one other factual
QUESTION:

Excuse me; I'm sorry.

MR. RICHARDS: Excuse me, sir.
QUESTION: This case originally began in the State
court?
MR. RICHARDS:

An injunction against the picketing

in the State court —•
QUESTION:

Under the State antitrust law, and then

you —
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Claim was filed —•

— and then you moved it to the federal

court -MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— and then the federal court declined to

24
sand it back to the State court? and then the complaint was
amended to add a count of federal antitrust laws; is that it?
MR. RICHARDS:

Yes, Your Honor, with one or — and

Connell, at the point, the case was not remanded —
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. RICHARDS:

— then under protest entered the

proffered agreement and then amended his complaint to attack
the agreement which he was then a party to.
Do I make myself clear?
QUESTION:

Well —

MR. RICHARDSs

I'm trying to say is that finally,

when — well, as a practical matter, when he saw the case was
not going back to the State court, Connell entered the
agreement.
QUESTIONS Entered the agreement?
MR. RICHARDS:

Entered the agreement, then challenged

it under -- amended the complaint to challenge it under the
Sherman Act.
The agreement, by the way, had a ten-day cancella­
tion clause on the part of either party.

So it's bean —

Connell has had the power ever since, on ten days' notice,
to cancel the agreement.
QUESTION: Well, of course, his claim is he was
coerced into the agreement.
MR. RICHARDS;

Clearly — he's clearly coerced into

25
the agreement»

I mean we don't —- we're not —

QUESTION:

If he’s right, I suppose he’d be

coerced into not presuming it; isn’t that right?
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, I — clearly, he v?as coerced

into the agreement, there’s no question of that.
QUESTION:

Well, if he had terminated it without

any coercion, he would be back where he was at the beginning.
MR. RICHARDS:

Of course.

My point is not —

Exactly.

we would be back where we

were, at no agreement, and be in dispute —
QUESTION:

They'd be immobilised as far as dealing

with anyone, unless your union approved them.
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, we would be back where we

were, and perhaps in the midst of a dispute; that’s correct.
That’s exactly right.
QUESTION: Well, is there any inaccuracy in my *™
MR. RICHARDS:
imply that there was.

No, no.

No.

I simply meant:

And I didn't mean to
that's right, we’d

be back where we were before, with the union demanding an
agreement, threatening to picket for it, and Connell
resisting the agreement.
QUESTION: And if they did picket, their whole
operation would be immobilised.
MR. RICHARDS:

Yes, that certainly would have an

effect on their operations; there's no question of that.

Or

26
there would be a very strong likelihood.
Well? of course, that's part of Connell's problem.
Connell is caught up in the peculiarities of the
construction industry.

Connell employs unionized iron

workers, laborers, carpenters, chooses to, from time to time,
subcontract non-union portions of his work, mechanical
contracting, he subcontracts, as the testimony is, sometimes
union, sometimes non-union.
But if he were an entire non-union contractor,
of course, the threat of Local 100 to picket for its sub­
contractor agreement would be no threat at all, because the
picketing would be ignored by Connell's own employees.
The problem Connell has is that some of his
employees opt to —
QUESTION; Well, he might have problems on the site
if he —
MR. RICHARDS: Well, ifthere were other contractors
at the site who —■
QUESTION;

-- were union.

MR. RICHARDS:

But what I5m saying is, the problem

is, as I see it, that Connell is caught up in the construction
industry problems of common site and the reluctance or the
Ttfillingness of other employees at the site to honor a picket
line, or, that is, not work on a job where there's a dispute.
QUESTION: Well, is there in this case any claim

27

that Connell is contracting out* farming out work which could
be done within his ox*m establishment?
MR. RICHARDS: That was not the contention, no.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RICHARDS:

Well, to say it the other way, there

are general contractors who do on occasion some of their own
mechanical contracting work, but that is not the pattern in
the industry and Connell was not one of those.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Richards, the fact of life is

that if he brought a non-union subcontractor on the site, the
whole project would shut down. That’s the fact of life, isn't
it?
MR. RICHARDS: Well, the fact of life is that in the
past if non-union subcontractors appeared at the project,
Local 100 would picket the non-union subcontractor and that
would frequently shut down the project.
QUESTION:

Shut it down.

MR. RICHARDS: That's exactly right.
This agreement is addressed to the. future, to avoid
just that problem by trying to extract a promise from Connell
that in the future —
QUESTION:

He would use only union contractors.

MR. RICHARDS:

Exactly.

QUESTION s Sure.
QUESTION:

Not only union contractors, but contractors

23

with this union.
Or am I mistaken about that?
MR. RICHARDS: Well, that's correct.

This union.

But there is one other fact of life, I guess, in the
construction industry, that is the trade, craft lines which,
as far as I’m aware, this is the only union that claims
jurisdiction in the Dallas area for performing plumbing and
steamfitting work.
This is just the nature of the beast. There is no
competitive union.
QUESTION:

Like under this -- [inaudible]

MR. RICHARDS:

No, there’s no competing union vying

for this representation, because that’s the nature of the
industry.
QUESTION: Would it make any difference if there
were?

*
MR. RICHARDS: Well, it would make some difference,

for instance, to the Labor Board; I don’t think it would make
any difference in an antitrust context, I mean, which is
what we’re here with.
The — we say several things in our defense.

We

first, of course, say that tills is simply not an antitrust
case, that it’s to be judged within the framework of the
labor statute.
We do say that the agreement we seek is protected

29
by the proviso to 8(s), the construction industry proviso;
and we understand, and I think that everyone seems to concede,
that if — I'm not sure now, but I have thought that everyone
conceded that if Congress had in fact authorized the
agreement that we obtained, that that would be — at least
in this context — a complete defense to the antitrust
contention, because the agreement stands alone unembellished
with any other broader conspiracy»
QUESTION: Do X understand, Mr. Richards, that really
what — you say this is something exclusively for the
cognizance of the National Labor Relations Board.
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Well, we have said —

That the dispute is.

MR. RICHARDS:

And that if *-~

We said —

QUESTION: Well, hear me out —
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

— and that if the -- if it is arguably

that that precludes any antitrust or any other, and if the
Board were to find that in soma respects you were not
protected by the proviso, then the Board has to pursue its
remedies which are, as I recall it,
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Injunctive relief.

— injunction, or you have — or

Connell has a 303 action for damages.
MR. RICHARDS:

We do say that this dispute is totally

30

enveloped by the provisions of Section 8(b) (4) (A) oi: the Ace
which precludes — either protects it or prohibits it.
There has been — and I did want to say — Connell
urged that there had been no Labor Board decision on the
point? a case was just decided last week, which I don't have
— I want to call to the Court's attention and seek per­
mission to do whatever is necessary to formally tender it.
It's another Los Angeles Building and Construction Trades
Council case, which comes -— which has been the source of
most of the litigation in the field.

214 NLRB No. 86,

released on November 7th.
Here —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Perhaps if --

MR. RICHARDS; What would be the proper thing?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

~ you wish to draw that

to our attention, it would be to ask, leave copies with the
Clerk and with your friend.
MR. RICHARDS:

All right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Because I suspect,

November 7th, it wouldn't be available in the services yet.
MR. RICHARDS:

No, it's not yet in the services.

I should reproduce sufficient copies.

May I do that and leave

them with your Clerk?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. RICHARDS:

Yes.

The L.A.. Building Trades case

31

is another one of the variants in the construction industry.
Here the contractor, the general contractor, had really
become purely a broker.

The facts are he had no employees at

all, of any kind, no collective bargaining contract of any
kind, and never had had any.
What he did, this particular general contractor,
was simply acquire the general contract and then subcontract
all the site work.
He was picketed for the standard L.A. Building Trade
Agreement, which has been the subject of much litigation in
the field.

The Board finds no violation, noting specifically

that when L.A. Building Trades demanded the standard form
subcontracting agreement and the general contractor refused,
that they then became involved in a primary — in a labor
dispute, which is a primary labor dispute, because in the
process of proceeding to picket for their standard agreement,
the complaint issued, and now the M.BB has dismissed the
complaint? no violation.
As I say, it simply points up again the kind of
patterns that exist in this industry and why, I suppose,
Congress did choose to create special provisions for it.
I want to make at least another point or two with
respect to the proviso, and specifically counsel5s contention
that somehow we are indirectly overruling Denver Building
Trades.

32

As we understand what Congress did in the two
provisos that were carved out of 8(e), the garment industry
proviso and the building trades provisos

in the garment

industry proviso — well, I should say it the other way.
The Denver Building Trades rationale was preserved in the
building trades proviso, that is, because agreements of this
nature cannot be enforced by coercion; that is, by picketing,
strikes, or threats of strikes.
An agreement such as we have with Connell can only
be enforced by judicial action, by going to court, suing to
enforce it*
Whereas, in the garment industry —- I guess because,
again, a recognition of peculiarities there — the garment
workers were given the right to enforce their, in effect,
no subcontracting agreements by coercion.

That is, we cite

in our brief a recent decision of the Second Circuit, by
Judge Friendly, on facts which are indistinguishable as
far as the garment industry — the same pattern.
That is, the garment union goes to a manufacturer
and says s

We want an agreement with you that you will

not

subcontract any of your work to anybody but unionised garment
manufacturers; we don't want a recognition for any of your
employees, don't want to bargain for them.
Judge Friendly finds it within the proviso protected;
the Board has now found it within the proviso as protected.

33

QUESTIONS

I thought this — you said a moment ago

that there was no doubt of the coercion involved here as
against Connell in the ~
MR. RICKARDS:

In the initial obtaining of the

agreement, I meant to say.
QUESTION:

Well, what was -- what form was it?

MR. RICHARDS:

It took the form of picketing, by

Local 100, to secure this agreement.
QUESTION: But then I thought you said, a minute ago
— perhaps I misunderstood you — that 8(e) doesn't allow that
sort of thing.
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, I'm sorry, the distinction is,

— for better or worse, the distinction is that such agreements
may be obtained by coercion but may not be enforced by
coercion in the building trades industry; in the garment
industry they may be both obtained and enforced.
Now, I should go on to say that this Court has not
said that; that’s what each of the Circuit Courts have said,
that have dealt with the question:

that coercion to obtain

the construction industry agreement is protected; to enforce
it is not.
QUESTION;
whom?

And you said to seek to enforce it is by

Brought by whom?
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, if — Local 100 in this

instance wanted to enforce this agreement, I suppose they would

34

have to file suit under 301, in either a State or federal
court, to secure injunctive relief, to compel —
QUESTIONS And that's to be distinguished from an
NLRB suit, where there's been a violation found, where there's
been no protection.
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Protection of a proviso.

MR. RICHARDS:

Is that it?

Exactly, Your Honor.

If the conduct here of Local 100 violated the
National Labor Relations Act, obviously the power is in the
Board, under 10(1) to secure injunction swiftly and promptly
against the picketing.
QUESTION:

And in that circumstance, Connell would

have a 303 action; is that it?
MR. RICHARDS:

And Connell would have a 303

damage action for any injuries he suffered as a consequence.
QUESTION:

But if it violated the National Labor

Relations Act, it would also lose its defense under the
antitrust statute, wouldn't it?
MR. RICHARDS:

I wouldn't think so.

don't even — no, I do not think so.
parallel is there.

I mean, I

I don't think the

In fact, it's our view ---

QUESTION:
MR. RICHARDS:

That the exclusive remedy is —Well, I'm not sure I want to say

the — I do want to say that clearly in our view the

35

determination of a Sherman Act violation doesn't turn upon
whether or not it's protected or prohibited by Taft-Hartley.
Specifically, certainly that’s true with respect to secondary
boycott provisions, which Congress adopted in 1947 after
extensive debate on whether to reinstitute antitrust remedies
for secondary boycotts, after specifically — well, we've set
the history out rather at length in our brief.
But finally on the floor of the Senate, Senator Taft
announces that he is abandoning his effort to reinsfcifcute
Sherman Act remedies for antitrust violations — for secondary
boycott violations? but, rather, as a compromise on the floor
of the Senate, inserting or going to offer Section 303.
QUESTION;

Well, I v/ant to get your position clear

about this, Mr, Richards,
If this is NLRB premise as to whether the proviso
protects this particular,
MR, RICHARDS;
QUESTION;

Right.

— and the Board were to conclude that

it did not, do you suggest that the sanctions of antitrust
may still be available, or that either the Board’s sanction
of injunction, coupled with the 303 sanction of the employer
for damages, is the exclusive remedy in this action?
MR. RICHARDS;
myself.

I’m sorry, I must have misspoke

Under the facts in this case, exclusive remedy is

that which Congress created in '47, 1 presume, and that’s the

36

10(1) injunction at the instance of the Labor Board? and
the 303 damage action —
QUESTION s And intended thereby to exclude any anti­
trust

actions?
/

. MR. RICHARDS;

That's the clear message? it seems

to me? in the congressional history of the statute.

That

seems inescapable.
QUESTION; Well? you say? then?

if there's any

remedy under the National Labor Relations Act against the
union for its conduct? the fact that such a remedy exists
under the National Labor Relations Act precludes a remedy
under the Antitrust Act, across the board?
MR. RICHARDS;

On the facts in this case? yes.

QUESTION; Well? but I'm not interested in the facts
of this case.
MR. RICHARDS; Well? what I'm trying to say? is
that it's conceivable to me that if you were dealing with
this as one part of a broad or over-all Allen Bradley kind of
conspiracy? you would have the kind of case in which there
could perhaps involve antitrust actions? but this is not what
we're dealing with.
We're dealing with this as a naked agreement?
standing alone; and? yes? I think the NLRB remedies of
injunctive relief and damages? actual damages? is exclusive
if there is a violation here

37
QUESTION:

But you don’t take that position

categorically with respect to any conceivable violation,, do
you?
HR. RICHARDS:

No, of course not, as to any

conceivable violation, I do not.
And this is the position asserted, I think, by the
Solicitor in support of —
QUESTION:

You don’t — then, if the union had

agreed with the multi-employer bargaining unit to attempt to
use its best efforts to get these kinds of agreements from
non-unionized general contractors, you might have a little
tougher case here, I suppose.
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, if there was — if this case

was embellished with any claim of a conspiracy or predatory
purpose, that would be a different case.

It is not the

case.
QUESTION:
different.

Well, of course, everything might be

What would be the result under the —
MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose —

— under the antitrust law?

MR. RICHARDS:

Well, I suppose --

QUESTION: Even though it might be perfectly
vulnerable under the labor law?
Let’s assume that it was, and that a 10(1) injunction
could issue and a 303 suit could be sustained.

Now, what

38

about antitrust liability?
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, I cannot exclude the

possibility that a fact situation could exist that involved
this agreement along with other aspects, which'would give
rise to an antitrust violation.

Because, it seems to me,

that would *— I can't exclude the universe.
But I do say that this kind of contract, contemplated
by Congress to be either lawful under 8(e) or unlawful,
carries with it, by congressional mandate, the sole remedy
for a violation there. And that the violation of 8(b)(4)(A)
does not give rise to a Sherman Act corollary violation,
I think Congress specifically went the other direc­
tion in '47, and I think they reaffirmed it in s59, when the
same debates were again at hand, about reinstitution of the
Sherman Act violations for certain kinds of secondary
boycotts.
QUESTION:

Mr. Richards, would you have an anti­

trust problem here if the favored-nation clause were in the
case?
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, my own view of it is Connell

\tfould not be in a position to complain about it.

I think a

mechanical contractor in Dallas who said, I would like to
compete, I can’t compete because of what's been extracted
from me as a consequence of a promise to others; that kind of
case might very well present it — it might very well raise

39

no problems, it would seem to me.
But that person has not come to court, and there’s
no facts suggesting that that’s present in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Richards, —

MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?

— there were actually two contracts

involved in this case, x*eren’t there?

The contract initially

between the Union and the members of the Association that
engaged in the multi-employer contract with the Union, and
the second contract was the coerced one with Connell.
Do you perceive that the contractors who were
participants in the multi-employer contract derived a benefit
from that contract, pursuant to which the Union agreed that,
in effect, that it would go out and make the type of contract
that it actually made with Connell, which minimized or
perhaps eliminated the non-union competition that these
contractors otherwise would have been subjected to?
MR. RICHARDS:
that in this record.

Well, first, there is no evidence of

I think the benefit that was derived,

if any has been derived — and I'm not sure that any has at
this point — would have been to increase the work opportunities
of members of Local Union 100, and to preserve their wages
from being eroded by non-union competition in the Dallas
area.

That's the benefit —QUESTION:

That's a benefit to the Union, —

40

MR. RICHARDS:

That's the direct benefit, and

that's what we're dealing with here.
I'm going to talk — well, actually, this is —■
and I would say, Ho, 1 do not see any significant or even,
as I see it, potential benefit.

If you were to follow the

argument of Connell, they say if we're successful, that
means that all -the contractors will be union contractors.
And of course that's what we obviously want.

We want

everybody to be a union contractor.
If we were forbidden — if we were foreclosing
from that status any mechanical contractor, that might
present a different kind of problem, but we're not doing
that, we're actively, in fact, trying to organise the one
non-union contractor whose name crept into this case:
Texas Distributors.
We've not been successful in doing it.

If he is

feeling pinched by this agreement, we welcome him with
open arms, and he can compete , on the same basis as all the
other contractors; that is, not undercutting our union wages
and conditions.
QUESTION:
very clearly,

I see your — I see the Union's interest

I was directing my question to whether or

not there isn't a contractors' interest also, to eliminate
competitor contractors who are not unionized.
MR. RICHARDS: Well,

41
QUESTION: That is to —
MR. RICHARDS:

— there is no suggestion that we

were trying to create a monopoly for that favored group in
this record, and that was not the nature of the contention.»
The — I suppose I would be foolish to say that it's
not conceivable that there was some spin-off benefits.

There's

no reason to make that argument»
To me the argument is, it’s a direct benefit for
us:

one, that we are — it’s our reason for being; that is,

to protect the wages of our members and to increase their
work opportunities.

And we're perfectly prepared to welcome

any non-union contractor who wants to share in giving his
employees those benefits.
I wanted to say one other thing, it seems, about
the nature of the argument made by — the antitrust argument
made by Connell.

And that is, it seems to me what they

really are trying to do is to resurrect, the primary-secondary
dichotomy as an antitrust determinate.
For one thing, their brief, reply brief, says
specifically that it's the absence of the employer-employee
relationship between Local 100 and Connell that gives rise
to the antitrust complications; but that's precisely what we
did away with, I assume, in Norris-LaGuardia, and what this
Court has said each time since then, or at least certainly
since Hutcheson, that is no longer relevant to the antitrust

42
determination,
The interest of Local 100 is clear. Connell is the
person who makes the decision about whether its members are
going to get work or not.

They can organize and organize?

as long as general contractors won’t contract with unionized
mechanical contractors, they have no work.
And, as I say, putting back in focus, for me at
least, their argument, Connell’s argument is a redefinition
of the term "labor dispute" in Norris-LaGuardia and a
redefinition of the term "labor dispute" which is identical
in the Labor Act, to insist, once again, that there must be
a proximate relationship between the disputants of employeremployee .
That's essentially what they're saying to us.
And stated on the other side of it, I can see —
the Chamber of Commerce has filed a brief here in support of
Connell, in which it says it would be perfectly lawful for
the Carpenters Union to enter a contract with Connell
saying that Connell would not subcontract any work of any
kind, plumber's work, electrician's work, to any but union
contractors.

And that that would be protected.

Well now, I — but I fail to see any significant
difference in terms of the anticompetitive effect, if you
were looking at it from a Sherman Act point of view, of that
agreement which they .concede to be lawful, and ours which

43
they attack»
In fact, I think ours is really more relevant to the
needs of the people involved? that is, the Plumbers Local
is looking for its members*

jobs and wages, and yet the

agreements that they would concede to be lawful seem to me
to have just as much, if not more, danger of anticompetitive
effect.
It is not accurate to state that in 1959 Congress
decided that it would be unlawful for 8(e) agreements to be
obtained by coercion.

Quite the contrary -- and we didn't

cite in our brief, although we should have

the post-

legislative history by Senator Goldwater is explicit:

that

this question of coercion to obtain construction industry
agreements was one that Congress left unresolved intentionally
in adopting 8(e).
The courts, the five Circuits, I believe, now that
have faced the question, as well as the Labor Board, have
uniformly said that picketing to obtain such agreements is
lawful in the construction industry.
Historically, this record contains testimony from
the Los Angeles Building and Construction Trades.

The L.A.

Building Trades has sought and obtained agreements of this
kind, much like the one that I referred to in the current
Board case, back before Taft-IIartley»
That was the pattern.

The Building Trades Council

44
is not a bargaining agent.

The bargaining agents are the

•various craft unions.
And yet, building trades agreements of this kind
predate Taft-Haxtley, that's the record evidence in this
case.

The L.A. Building Trades agreement has been before the

NLRB in a number of cases.

Church's Fried Chicken, which we

cite in our brief, and the most recent case which I've just
mentioned to you.
Looking back at old antitrust doctrines, frankly,
I can't see the difference between this case and the Teamsters,
Milk Drivers, Lake Valley.
In Lake Valley, the dairy drivers think they're
being threatened by a system of vending milk in Chicago, so
they're going to put pressure on retail outlets and say,
"Don’t buy", by picketing, threats and coercion, "Don’t buy
any longer from these dairies".
When they acquiesce, they take the pressure off.
And that's been — no antitrust,
A Second Circuit case of Levering and Garrigues,
which was here at one point in the Supreme Court, where the
Iron Workers Union in New York, threatened by what was called
the Iron League, a non-union, open-shop iron worker erection
companies, went to owners, general contractors, architects,
threatened labor difficulties if they did not agree not to
use non-union iron working firms in the future.

45
And this is just what

'this is the typical pattern

that has emerged in this industry, one which has been
traditionally thought to be exempt from emtitrust, which
Congress, we think, in specifically addressing itself to the
problems of this industry, in '47 and in '59, made the
conscious choice that:

what is evil here, we are going to

define with precision.
And it did define with precision, as well as the
— the evil as well as the remedy, specifically rejecting
the arguments that antitrust action should somehow be employed
here to remedy the secondary boycotts, which were — took place
in the construction industry.
QUESTION:

Well, you — I take it your position is,

however, that even if there was no exemption from — no
construction industry exemption here, that you'd be making
much the same argument?
MR. RICHARDS:

I would make — I would make the

argument that this agreement does not violate antitrust,
even in the absence of —
QUESTION:

You say that this is

within the labor

— the antitrust exemption?
MR. RICHARDS:

Exactly.

Of course.

Because it's

addressed to the immediate concern of a local union and their
interest in preserving jobs and preserving their wages.
And, irrespective of the presence of the 8(e) pro-

46
viso, that it would be within the exemption.
I'm simply saying that the presence of the 8(e)
proviso makes it unnecessary, I think, to reach the question.
QUESTION:

Because, after all, Congress didn't

say in the proviso, or anywhere in the Act, that anything
that doesn't violate the labor law is exempt from antitrust
liability.
MR. RICHARDS:

They did not way that —

QUESTION: So you have to get to the other question
of whether it's within the labor exemption, don't you?
MR. RICHARDS:

I do think Congress -- we would

say that the legislative history shows that Congress
consciously chose a specific remedy for this kind of action,
and said, We're rejecting antitrust, we're rejecting
injunctions at the instance of private parties, we're giving
it to the Board, we're rejecting treble damages, we're
giving only compensatory damages —
QUESTION: Those are inferences you're arguing
from the legislative history.
MR. RICHARDS:

Well, I think — sure —■ they’re

inescapable -QUESTION:

It didn't say so, did it?

MR. RICHARDS:
QUESTION:

Yes, it —?

It didn't say so, did it?

MR. RICHARDS:

It didn't say so precisely.

QUESTIONt

No.

MR. RICHARDS:

I think not.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

You have four minutes left, Mr. Canterbury.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH F. CANTERBURY, JR.,ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CANTERBURY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Mr. Richards suggesting that there's plenty avail-”
able remedies pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act
is like giving Connell snow in winter.

It's well known that

the General Counsel ivill not issue a complaint, and NLRB
couldn't decide it if they wanted to.
No way they can decide the question, because the
General Counsel won't let them.
So, you know, going to the Board is a useless act,
and as I said in my brief I might as well file in a waste­
basket.
Now, let's look at what is this agreement addressed
to.
Mr. Richards says the agreement is addressed to
benefit union members directly.
The effect of the agreement is not to benefit
members, union members directly? if it was, let them take
actions against those who employ their members.

43
The effect of the agreement is to drive sub­
contractors or manufacturers who furnish and install products
at the construction site out of the market, unless they"11
come into line with Local 100.

That's the effect of the

agreement.
If it were addressed to the immediate employeremployee relationship, they may well have a point, but it's
not.
Connell, if his carpenters should enter into a
collective bargaining agreement — which he has one with the
Carpenters — they've got their work to protect.

And if

they make limitations on subbing out their work, and if he
gives it up in collective bargaining, for whatever scale of
value he puts on it, that's rising out of the collective
bargaining process.

There's something to trade back and

forth, in employer-employee negotiations, which the whole
Labor Act is designed to foster.
Stepping outside of the employer-employee
relationship, with a 50-cent piece of cardboard and a picket
sign, either the contractor signs up and agrees to assist the
union to drive all other — all open-shop mechanical
contractors out of the market, or else the general contractor
goes broke.
Of course, he can't resist it for long.
So, Your Honors, I believe that when we really

49

look at the effect of the agreement, let's look at who are
they addressing it to.

They're not addressing it to those

that employ their members.

They're going without that,- and

going outside of that source, to lock up this market.
Now, I don't care whether we call it a conspiracy —
and I don't believe you do, either —* there's, you know,
there's a lot of secrecy here in the term "conspiracy".
just call it a contract.

Let's

Let's look at the contract.

A written contract.

Connell will not do business

with anybody that doesn't have an agreement with us.
Call it a combination.
a non-labor party combining.

We've got a labor party and

Or a conspiracy — I don't

believe the semantics make that much difference.
I think we have a clearcut contract in restraint of
