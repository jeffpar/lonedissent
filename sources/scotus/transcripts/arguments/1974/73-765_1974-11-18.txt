!1R. DUtlAU:

Mr. Chief ,Tustice, and may it please

the Court:
The ques'o1on this case presents is whether an
employer raay coerce an employee to participate in an
interview with that employer, unaided by a union representative

where the o~tcome or the interview is reasonably

believed by th.:i employee to subject him to the risk of
disc plinv.ry action.

1ay

that employer fire the two employee

l:'(lcause ahc fear::; it, she asks a

When

that fcllott employee is willing to furnish the aid, she

The employer may be ~•equ1red -- if he doesr 't want the

But

7
it is not a privilege in ,;he employer to refuse to meet or
to compel a meeting 11ith a."l employee 11ithout the assistance
of a fellow employee, if that is requested .
I think the tacts, as they are stated, should
focus this issue rather aharply.

Lawrence Gerlach, t·ho is the preGlGent of '~he compony, hiG
wife, Kathryn Gerlach, who is the production mana~er, their
son, Lnwrence Gerlach, who is the ~eneral manar:er.
quES'!'ION:

Junivr.

MR. DUNAU:

Junior, yes, sir.

There is a certified bargaining representative,
certified to represent the produ~tion employees.
On

the unio:1' s side with respect to day-to-day

problems which arise, there is a shop chnirlady called
Delila I-1ulford.

There is a.n aasistant shop chairlady

called Martha Cochran.

"'hey 11ere elected to their posts.

And then there is a longtimo empJ.oyoe, a
Catherine Kini;, about whor. these events center.
On 'riday, Octooer 10, 1969, the three Oerlach's,
the shop

chairlad:,, Catherine K.l.n

and two other employees

MCet,
The eruployees r.re complaining about the wase rate.
71cy say they can't make a <lecen•. war,;e under the piecework
system :1-n effect.

The raeeting ends in an acrimonious

8
exchange.

The Gerlachs say, "If you don't like it here, p-o

elsewhere . "
Later that oarn~ afternoon Catherine King shuts
down her machine.

She star.;s gesturine 11ith her hand:,.

causes a minor disturbance.

She

Mrs. Oci•la~h tells her, "Resume

production."
Catherine Kin, tel ls h?r, "!!ind yo 1 1!' own business."
At that point, tire. Gerlach oays to Kini-;, "Go do~m
and see the president, I• r. Gerlach. '
She goea.

Jut on the 'ifl.Y, she asks the shop chair-

lady to accompany her to assi::;t her

t this meeting with th-=

president.
lihen they get there, the Gerlachs object to the
presence or the shop chairlady and she re spends, "Catherine
paid her clues and she ia entitled to have mo be there. 11
Since Catherine ref•Joed to submit to the intervi ew
without the presence or the shop cha1.l•lady, and since the
Gerlachs refused to have her there, th'?Y were both sent back
to their work stations.
The fir!: 1; •,tow fell on Sunday, October 12th.
:!ulford is called on th<.? telephone.

She is told

,he is suspended for two days and the reason 1~ that she
attempted to represent Cahter:!.nc King.
The next day, Monday, October 13th, again, King is
called to the office.

This time she aslrn the assistant

9
shop chairlady, Martha Cochran, to accompany her.
Martha Cochran's p.-,ce:.encc 1s objected to.

Cochran

asks, "What do you want to ope al: to Kini; acout.
She is told,

11

;

e want to take up where lfe left

off on Friday."
To 11hich Cochran reopondz, "Well, I'm sorry, but
if that's what you want to talk to her about, that is
union business and she has aslced me to represent her.

I

am a union stew:ird and that i'l mv duty."

[King was]
Ar;oin, Gerlach refused permissiou to return to

work been.use she refus<>d to oubmit to a priva~c tnter'liew.
Cochren':; t '.Me card unr; nulled froM the rack.
'!'he next day, Tuesd'l;/, Octobe,:, 1 1 th.

Cochran is

n01-: su.,pendcd for two Jays for scekintr. to represent Kini"
and Kinr, is not al:.owed to return to •1ork because she
refuses to sub:,it to an interview 1-rithout the presence of
her union representative.
Wednesday, October 15th, .lulford's two-day
suspension is at an end.
Gerlachs,

The three of them r,o to the

Co•;'.1ran 1::; tc. ld she can't return to work

because si1e has p;ot one "'ore day suspension.

:\ulford J.s [l°!. lo11ed to return to wor-i< but she 1s
admonished to mind her own business, to which she responds,

"I was mindinr;; my own bunincss.

And the events c 1 •lminate on October lfth.

She then r;oes to 'ir. '.erlach, Sr.
"Am I fired?"

!}he ask3 hil'l,

and she is told, "You want to dran l!nemploy-

ment compensation, go draw it," and that is the end of the
third person.
!lo11, the board and ~he Court or J\ppeal3 are in
agreement as to one matter.

The board fo,md, and the Court

of Appeals agreed that Cochran's fi,•inll: 1·1as an unfair labo·•
practice because st,e had presented a 1s1•ievance.
fell after she prcsent<?d a Brievancc.

required.
QUESTIOll:

m.

DU!ll\.U.

That issu~ is not here.
T11at ics1c is not here. :,our llonot'.

There is no c~oss-petition.
The bo2rd end the Court of

J\o~eals disagree as

to the Mulford and as to King and as to Coc~ran's suspen:iion
for the two days precedinr, her discharge.
And as to that, the board finds Kinr, reasonably
feared that shz would be subjected to disclplin':!ry action
in the event

or as a resu:t of the outcome of this

interview.
Since stie rees~ ably feared oub.~ection to
disciplinary

action, ::he employer had two alternatives.

12

If the e:iploye,,, w:mted to talk to her,

.;r~

wa

entitled, the enployee, to ~ave the union rerresentatlve
there at her request.
The employer, if he didn't wan

to talk with l'er

with the union representative present. v~s free not to have
the interview at all.
But the employer could not have it both ways.

He

could not have both an interview with the employee and
effacement of the union representative.
In the board's view -- and we can summarize it in
the two sentences it wrote in the later case, "It is a
serious violation or the employee's lndi vidua! r:l{"Jlt to

The discharr:e is because the ~uy was neglicent or

If that is the reason for the

discharge, the only recourse the emplcyee has is under hia

an arbitrator to determine 11hether Just cause for dischur,e
existed.

of the National

Labor Relat.!.ons Act as it :1as been amended.
Now, a nunber of situations exist with reopect to
the possible scope of representation rirhts of an employee

29
under Section 7 of the act.
There is nothinr. in the wordin~

?er se of this

section of the act which reaJ.ly thro11s any direct light on
the subject.
For example, there 1,:; nothing in Section 7 that
says an employee shall h~ve the ri h~ to a representative

lfow, the word "concerted ' of course, has a

technical meaning that has be~n considered by a number of
courts and it has ~enerally been held to mean ~roup
activities for representation activities that the p;roup as
a whole uas interested 1'1,

l!P. JEMKI!le:

To en ;ir...: in concerted activities

for the ?urpose of collective bargai'lir7 or other mutual

Yes, your

Honor.
'fhe question here is wt. thcr or not the word
"concerted" embraces one employee s:.ich as we have in each
aspect of this case or in many of the cases that have been

30
held, whether that"concerted" applies to them Hith respect
to their 01·,n individuaJ right:; with respect to an employer
at a time.
For example, any d1sctplinarian situation
involving one employee.

Coes that involve a concerted or

group activity?
llov, it is clear tha, where a group act1v1t~, is
involved, then the employees have a r1ghC to representatives
but it does r.ot say, as I read the act here, that an
employee has t!'.e ri~h'~ to a representati•1e to handle his 01m

lfo11, .tt is interestinf", I i:hink, if you loolc back
over the hi::n:ory of <;his :;ituation, that no court, and
certainly not tt:e Labo: Rel::.tion

Board, has eve1• said that

on the basi::i of that lanc;uar,e, an employee has the r1e-.ht to
a representative with him at all times and in all places
under all circumstances.
In other words, no one has ever contended that
that lan~age there ~ives a broad, across-the-board right
to an employee to have a friend with him or to have a
union representative with him under any circumstances when

32
management talks to him.
Dol'ln through the hist or~•, up until qunli ty came
along, over a period or almost 25 years, tne rig~ts in this
regard were exceedingly limited.

A dichotor,y had developeu

by virtue of beard deciJions.
A di 1ision of this uhole, if you please, which
would -- the "whole" being the rir,ht of an employee to have
a representative with him at nny time, under any circumstances -- no one :iaid that 11as the status of the law.

No

one interpreted Section 7 that way.
But their carved off one piece of that whole and
said that where there is an interview taking place between
employer and employee, in that situation and where it is not
an investigatory, a fact-findinr; type oi' irtterview; in other
words, an interview is first nnd then cont;•1cted further to
a particular kind or !nte•vicw, one that 11ao not investi{".atory or fact-find.ing bu<; one l'h:! ch hcd to do with the
impo::iinr.; of d:!.llcips.. -In , a dc,ci&ion by an c•nployer to an
employee, pa:rnJ.n,.,. judgment upon his case or a problem.
And ..n tha·, very limited area, in those circumstances, an eoployce had

a

rir;ht

~o have a representative

present to him in those pn.-ticular times.
No11, whether this is a dichotol"y that is based
upon any real, rational reason or not i~

something that is

Do you see ·my analogy, even remote,

totally different field, 1n the criminal field, where this
Court held that if a pc:m"lty of confinement is to be imposed,
there mu::;t be a lawyer.
How, that do~s not . ean that a cni:;e -- a trial is
invalid if it 13 held without a lawyer.

But ·1hat it does

39

mean is that the jud~e elects to go ahead without counsel,

for confinement.

He may not •~ake. a valid i 1 1dgment or

Is there any analop;y that you sec here at all?
f.lR. JEt!KHlS:

I don It think that I see the

apparent analor:y, your Honor, but I de no'~ think that it
will work in the industrial relations area because here

MR. JENKillS:

Maybe in a criminal situat.ion but in

the crir,1inal situc t!.on, you t•cach a conc::.usion before the
court o.nd in tne labcr situation, you don't.
There ere, as a for instance, an employee gives
in1 orr.iation to the co·1rany and t·1e company ~hen determines
at a later timo to diocharp;e the employee.

The employee, if

he has the union representation, can arbitrate the
reasonablen'lss of that.

There is a step beyond the court

available to him.
B•.1t h~re, in industrial life -- and I am not sure
that, uhtle the jol> r-tgt.cs a:·e quite important, I am not
sure they are also equntod with a person's civil rights and

40
liberties as they would be in the case that your Honor
sue;r;ests.
l'he court~ hcve r,en~rally rejected the analogy
between the Es_cobedo-typc of doctrines which have a·.; te:npted,
in some instances, to be appli 1 to ~he industrial fields.

that the Labor Board has developed between when you are in

!lR. ,TEHKIIJS:

Gissel w~.s MY client and I wa:i here

on that and I recall how astounded we were 11hen the Gissel
case was argued that the brief of the board, for the first
time in this Court on the question of the good faith doubt

42

took a totally different view in their brief here tha.;1 they
had ever before and they backed off of tha-.; i,:ood faith
doubt because, simply, 1~ doesn't ~ark in prnctice and our
problem with ~~:i,_1_t_x here ir

..c1ctly th(> aame.

We see ,;he board in 'lLl:lJ:Y.. movinr; into the s,.me

here as they did under tho good fai~~ doubt.

In Gissel they, prior l;o t'lat, they were pcychoanalyzing the employer to f:tnd

01•

i~ he, between his ears,

had a good faith dcubt.
Here, even ~:orse than that, we are psychoanalyzinr;
the employee and m.'! are rr.al,;~ni; the C;:nployer' s unfair labor

beliefs of the employee because ·he exception that the board
would carve out here in 9.1:!..al:'..':·

QUESTION:

Well, I gather then, 'Ir. Jenkins, your

submission is that there can never bt'l an unfair labor

an interview with an employee - - the employee to have a

MR. JENKINS:

Is that the answer?

MR. JENKINS:

The answer -- your Honor, the

answe1• 1s, yes.

QUESTION:

There ~r€ n~ circumstances under

1•1h:'.ch, unless the collective bargaining ...greement provides
for it.

MR. JENKINS:

Yes, your Honor, and I think this

follows from the plain readint; of Section 7 because it
doesn't provide for it in there.
But lot me just hasten to add that that is not
the position that the Laber Board has taken.

They have

taken - - there are some in!:>tanccs, namely, when discipline
is involved and the courts have upheld them with respect
to ~hat rle;ht.
But I think the problem here in this decision, to
those of us 11110 are practitioners, is that ire have a
oituation where the ocopE' of the cmployee'a rig)'lto have
b0en spelled out in case aftr;r case over this period of

MR. JENKINS:

I don't feel that Section 7 provides

for that and I think that

Then that uould turn on what an

it is a distinction without ~eality.

By grievance, I mean, if, as or when

there has been some sort of disciplinary action.

Mn. JENKINS:
QUESTION:

Afterwards, then.

MR. JENKINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

That is correct .

The board has gone farther, now, to

say that whether discipline is involved or not, even thouGh
it is investigatory, he is entitled to representation.
MR. JENKII.S:

Yes, your Honor.

They have gone

the ex'cra inch or further than that nol'I to ra:I.:;e that and I
suppose we might presuppose that the next step would be,
you can have a representative person any time.

The Cour~ of Aopeala didn't ~o as far

as you are su",gesting, did it?
MR. JENKD1S:
QUESTION:

They -- no, your Honor, they didn't.

l·IE::11, of course, they denied enforce-

ment of the board's order -- or did they?
MR, JENKINS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

They denied --

f.tR. JENKINS:
QUESTION:

-- yes.

They denied enforcement.

So I gather you think that denial is

something you can support withouc cross petitioning?
r-ti'!.

JEliKI'iS:

Yes, your Honor, I Jo because I

think that "or the purposes of disposition of this case,
the position chat the Court of Appe1ls took is sufficient.

But I thjnk that the Co11rt o" Appea:!.s stil 1 •1ould allow a
certain area of representation t1at I feel is not spelled out
clearly in this act here.

So you find a-· it is a question,

of course, of where you are go:!.ng to draw the line on how
wide and under what circumstances you are goinp: to say that
the law requires that an employer permit an employee to have
a representative present with him.
QUESTION:

Do you regard the Fourth Cit·cuit Is

utterances on this oth~r area as dictum in the case?
MR, JENKINS:

I dor:' t -- I thinlt so, your Honor,

because I don't thinl: they were necessary to dispose of this
case.

Circuit .
QUESTIOI~:

Well, did you lift this out of a

Seventh Circuit brief or something?
MR. JENKINS:

Yes, part of it, your Honor.

In closing, I'd like to make the comment that it
would seem that the exception or the provision for
representation which the petitioner here is a.•guing for
and which the Labor Board requires, namely, representation
where the eaployee has reasonable cause to believe that
disciplinary action may result, sets up a criteria of the
existence or non-existence of an unfair labor practice by
an eroployer upon the fears of an employee.
If the employee fears that he may be disciplined,
no matter how slight, then, unde1• the board rule, he is
entii:ler; to rapresent,ation but it is the employer who must
make a decision without the facts as tc whether or not this
fea,• is reaoonable

01•

•1hethe1' o:.• not this fear is justified .

And I do not think the flowing of statutory rip,hts
of representation should be present :.>r non-e::istent,
depending upon whethe1• an employee fears a certain result
or uhether

he is completely without fear on the subject.
