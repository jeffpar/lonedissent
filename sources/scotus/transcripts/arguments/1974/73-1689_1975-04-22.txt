P R O C S B D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear argument

next in No. 73-1609, United States against American Building
Maintenance Industries.
Mr. Wilson, I think you can proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE B. WILSON ON
BEHALF OF TEE APPELLANT
MR. WILSON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

I was interested in listening to the prior

argument because we were dealing with matters of economic
reality, serious matters, and matters vrhich concern
individuals.
I think this case is a little different in that
it involves matters of economic reality which concern the
national economy.

This case is here today because in 1930

the Congress was concerned with increasing concentration in
that national economy, and it was concerned with increasing
concentration which V7as resulting from mergers and
acquisitions, and it was concerned with acquisitions by
national companies of local firms and that kind.of acquisition
%
which was contributing to that increasing concentration.
This case squarely presents the question of whether
Congress effectively executed its expressed intention to
prevent that kind of mergers and acquisitions.

There is

really only one issue or decision in this case, whether

4
Congress in section 7 of the Clayton Act intended to exercise
tile full scope of its power to reach mergers and acquisitions
not only in commerce and the. flow of commerce, but also
those which affected commerce.
If Congress didn't so intend, and if Congress did
not so effectively legislate,, then a series of acquisitions
could occur, acquisitions of intrastate firms which could
result in a situation which Congress clearly sought to avoid.
It sought to avoid that situation in a statute which it
denominated as a supplement to the Sherman Act.

And as we

shall see, Congress in the Sherman Act intended to exercise
the full range of its power.
The facts of this are as follows:

In 1971 the

United States filed this civil action under section 7
challenging a transaction in which the American Building Main­
tenance Industries —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume there

at 1 o'clock, Mr. Wilson.
MR. WILSON;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wilson, yon may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

BRUCE B. WILSON ON

BEHALF OF APPELLANT (Continued)
MR. WILSON:
it please the Court:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
Just before the luncheon recess we

had outlined the central issue in this civil antitrust case
which was filed by the Government in 1971.
In this case the Government challenged, under
section 7 of the Clayton Act, a transaction in which a firm,
American Building Maintenance Industries, acquired control
of two janitorial service firms doing business In southern
California.

One was the Benton Maintenance Company, the

other was the J. E. Benton Management. Corporation.
In terms of market shares at the time of the
acquisition, American controlled about 10 percent of the
janitorial service market in Southern California, and the
Benton companies combined had about 7 percent.

Of course,

the statute with which we deal here today, section 7 of the
Clayton Act, prohibits the acquisition by any corporation
engaged in commerce of the stock or assets of another
corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of
that acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition

6
or tend to create a monopoly,
This case involves the meaning of four words in that
statute^

those four words being ”also engaged in commerce."

There is no question as to whether the acquiring firm, American.was engaged in commerce, no such question has been raised.
But the decision in the district court was on a motion for
summary judgment on the grounds that the acquired firms were
not corporations engaged also in commerce.
The Government introduced various affidavits, none
of which I think are disputed, showing that Benton had provided
janitorial services necessary to support the interstato
operation of its customers, that Denton had purchased substantial
quantities of janitorial supplies manufactured outside of
California, that it negotiated at least two major contracts
with ©ut-of-Stata customers, and that it did, although to an
admittedly minor extent, utilise interstate Communications
facilities in its business.
The court below entered summary judgment in 1373«.
and in doing so, it adopted almost verbatim the findings of
fact and conclusions of law submitted by American, but
proposed prior to the time that the United States had filed
its affidavits.
Of course, once the court had concluded that, it
resulted in a holding that section 7 had no application to
this case.

But there was, however, in the court below, no

7
opinion explaining the court's reasoning as to how it reached
its conclusion.
The first issue which this appeal raises and on which
is easily disposed of is whether the power of Congress could
reach this kind of a transaction.

This Court disposed of that

question in Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar
in 1947.

There the question was whether an agreement by

sugar refiners which sold sugar in interstate commerce could
agree on the price, whether they could agree on th© price
which they were going to pay to sugar beet growers located in
northern California.

This Court in that ease clearly held

that such an agreement on price was an agreement which
affected commerce and one that was within the reach of the
Sherman Act, tha first antitrust statute.
Mow, of course, when we are dealing with the Sherman
Act and with the Clayton Act, we are not dealing with the
same statutes.

But we are dealing with statutes in which

Congress sought to address substantially the same problem,,
the problem of monopoly, the problem of trusts, the problem
of anticompetitive effects on the American economy.
When Congress passed the Clayton Act in 1914 it
made clear that that Act was intended to supplement the
Sherman Act which Congress had enacted in 1890.

In the

light therefore of Mandeville Farms, the holding of thin
Court in that case, there doesn't seem to be much question

but that Congress, if it so desired and intended, could have
made the scope, of the Clayton Act equally as broad.

It could

have reached a merger or acquisition of the type with which
we deal here.
And this brings us, I think, down to the central
issues

Did Congress intend, in section 7 of the Clayton Act,

to exercise, as it did in the Sherman Act, the full extant
of its power under the Ccxmasrce Clause?
I think if one looks at the history of the antitrust
laws, one can conclude only that Congress in enacting section
did intend to exercise the full extent of those powers.

In

the Sherman Act we have not only Mandeville Farms, we have
South-Eastern Underwriters in 1944, again holding

that in

that Act Congress wanted to go the full extent of its
constitutional power in restraining trust agreements and in
.restraining monopoly agreements.
And thus, given the history of that Act, Senator
George in 1890, stating that Sherman was ingeniously drawn
to cover every case that is within the commercial power of
Congress, and Senator Sherman, after whom the act was, of
course, named, noting that the bill was just as broad and as
sweeping and as explicit as the English language could make
it, we come then to 1914, and we see a Congress in 1914
dissatisfied and disappointed with the application of the
1890 law.

We find the Congress disappointed and dissatisfied

with its efforts to control trusts and monopolies.
And

bo

in 1914 we find the Congress enacting a law

which according to its title was to supplement the existing
laws against restraints and monopolies.

The Congress in that

Act wanted to arrest such restraints in their incipiency.
And they intended to do that insofar as it was possible to do
so.

And they did it in section 7 of the Clayton Act.
QUESTION:

Has the Department taken cut after any

mergers such as this before?
MR. WILSON:

we have —

That wasn't

the question.
MR. WILSON:

No, but it’s a merger of the same type.

And that, I think, is vary important, because the question
here is does the jurisdiction of the Act extend to this kind
of a merger?

The question in Bennington was whether Bennington,

MR. WILSON:

is correct on that.

I think the appellee

But until we get to such cases as

Bennington, until we get to the problems within, let us say,
the last 10 years, the Department indeed has not challenged
that kind of a merger.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Wilson, on page 36 of your brief at

the top of the page, that sentence states that previous
section ? cases have involved both acquiring and acquired firms
that had bean engaged in the flow of commerce.
I take that to mean that this is the first case thca
Justice Department has brought in which the acquired firm was
hot engaged in commerce.
MR. WILSON:

Is that correct?

Mr. Justice Powell, I agree that this

is the first case in this Court which clearly presents the
question of whether the acquisition by and interstate firm,
ho question on the acquiring corporation, of an acquired firm
dealing primarily in intrastate commerce, but with the inter­
state contacts that we have hare serving interstate firms,
buying supplies from out of state.

I think this is the first

case which presents this kind of a set of facts.
QUESTION:

You referred to the dissatisfaction of

ii
Congress In 1914 with the limitations of the Sharraan Act.
Has Congress indicated any dissatisfaction with the failure
of the Justice Department to bring this type of suit before
in the last 60 years?
MR. 'WILSONs

I think the Congress, Mr. Justice

Powell*, has indicated that it wants us to bring this kind of
a suit where the result of the acquisition is going to foe in
the words of the statute "substantially to lessen competition."
And it has indicated that time and time again.

It did again

in 1950 when it amended the statute.
QUESTIONS

Yes, but it has consistently refused to

put the words "affecting commerce" in the Act.
MR. WILSON!

Oh, Mr. Justice White, 1 don't think it

ha 3.
QUESTION s

1111 put it this way:

There have been

proposals ~
MR. WILSONs

There have been proposals, but one

cannot rely, as this Court has recognised, on the failure of
Congress to act on a specific proposal as an indication of
Congress' intent in enacting a statute which it has already
enacted one way or another.
QUESTION;

But you certainly wouldn't rely on a

failure to amend the statute to show that Congress expressed
some dissatisfaction with the way the Department of Justice
was enforcing the Act.

12
MR. WILSON:
QUESTIONs
MR. WILSON:

Oh# heavens no.

One has to —

What other evidence is there?
Well, there is the evidence of Congress

and the statements of its intention in 1950, again, came back
to the Clayton Act in 1950.
QUESTION:

I take it then that the —

QUESTIONs

You are under the Department's position

now that the Act would mean exactly the same.if the words
"engaged in commerce” weren’t in the Act at all.
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:

Read "engaged in or affecting commerce."
I know, but let's just take them out.

No corporation shall acquire,directly or indirectly,the whole
or any part of the stock of any other corporation if the effect
would be to substantially lessen competition in any line of
commerce.

The Act would be precisely what you say it is now*

the way you would want to construe it.
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. WILSON:

Yes, sir.
So those are just surplusage.
I think that is correct.
And you must take that position.
Yes, sir.

Coming back to 1950, Congress then made the Act
applicable to acquisitions of aseate as well as the stock
of competing corporations.

And the House report indicated

that the 1950 amendments made the Act less restrictive,

prohibiting mergers and acquisitions where in any line of
commerce in any section of the country, the effect of that
acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition.
The report made it clear that what Congress was trying to do
was go even further , if they could, than they went in the
Sherman Act.
One can’t conclude, looking at that legislative
history, that Congress intended that the reach of the Clayton
Act should be less than the reach of the Sherman Act.
But there was a concern raised in Congress at that
time that the Act might be construed to prohibit the acquisition
of a local business by another local business in the same
town.

These concerns are addressed in the legislative history

and rather than narrowing the reach of the jurisdiction undor
the commerce requirement, the Congress limited the terms of
the substantivo offenso.

The original craft provided that the

Act would be violated if competition was substantially
lessened in any community, and that language concerned the
Senate, and the Senate noted that that language was dropped
and the phrase "in any section of the country” was substituted
in order to get rid of that concern.
But even so, the Senate also concurred in the view
that it was the purpose of this legislation to assure a
broader construction of the more fundamental provisions that
are retained than has been given in the past.

14
Then we coras, now retroversing a little bit, to the
questions of the 1936 amendments which inserted in the
Clayton Act provisions governing price discrimination.

But

those provisions and the merger provisions, section 7, have
very different jurisdictional tests, and the jurisdictional
tests under the price discrimination provisions were those
construed by this Court in Gulf Oil Corporation v, Copp Paving
Company, decided earlier this term.

The Court there expressly

declined to decide the question which we are dealing here with
today.
If oie examines those jurisdictional provisions, the
differences are immediately apparent.

To violate the price

discrimination provisions, one must be engaged in commerce,
yes, the same language which we have under the merger provision
One must also make a sale in the course of such commerce.
And, finally, either or any of the purchases involved in the
price discrimination must be in commerce.

So we have there

a three-part test for jurisdictional purposes, not the single
test which is involved in section 7.
Second, I think we have to note that this Court has
recognised that the congressional enactments dealing with
commerce reveal the process of legislation which is, in the
words of, I believe, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, strikingly
empiric.

The Court has uniformly looked to what Congress was

trying to do in enacting particular statutes.
f

••

Again, Mr.

15
Justice Frankfurter said if we do not do that, to search for
a dependable touchstone is as rewarding as an attempt to
square the circle.
So we have to look to the intent of Congress in
passing this statute in 1914, in amending it again in 1950,
and the construction which this Court has since placed on
section 7 of the Clayton Act.

The Court in '

Von8 s

Grocery

noted that the 1950 amendments were designed to broaden
the scope of the antitrust lav/3.
QUESTION:
acquisition of assets

But the amendments simply added the
to stock acquisitions,

That was

basically what it did, wasn’t it?
MR. WILSON:

That’s right.

It did not, Mr. Justice

Stewart, in any way change what the jurisdictional requirements
had been in 1914.
QUESTION:

Right.

That’s what I thought.

Does it carry very far ■— you undoubtedly must think
it does because you spent a good deal of time in your brief
and oral argument on it, but I wondered how far does it carry
you just to say that Congress intended to implement, add to,
effectuate, amplify the Sherman Act, both in 1914 and again
in 1950 when it enacted and then amended the Clayton Act,
because it is clear from the language of the Clayton Act that
in many ways it did add to the Sherman Act, but in certain
other ways it very clearly was more limited than the Sherman

16

Act quite apart from the question now before us.

For example,

what is now section 7 of the Clayton Act applies only to
corporations, whereas the Sherman Act applies to individual
people as well as corporations.

That certainly is a more

limiting jurisdictional coverage, isn't it?
MR. WILSON:

Well, I think it is more limiting in the

sense that it limits the substantive offense under the Clayton
Act, but there is no indication in any of the legislative
history that Congress intended the jurisdictional reach of the
Clayton Act to be less
QUESTION:

That's jurisdictional reach, if I —

MR. WILSON:

— than jurisdiction which Congress

exercised under the Sherman Act.
QUESTION:

You can argue about what the word

"jurisdictional" means, but certainly no matter how strangling
of competition potentially, at least, the acquisition of an
individual person’s assets might be, even though that person
was engaged in commerce, by somebody else engaged in commerce,
section 7 simply doesn’t reach it as a matter of statutory
scope, or jurisdiction, if you want to call it that.

Isn't

that correct?
MR. WILSON:

Well, I don't think the substantive

offense is so defined.
QUESTION:
MR. WILSON:

Precisely.

Precisely.

Now, if Congress —

17
QUESTION:

Even though the --

MR„ WILSON:

go ahead.

If Congress juri3dictionally wanted to

reach it, there's no doubt that they could.

And the question

is did they intend to reach this kind of a merger,
QUESTION:

And there is no doubt that if Congress

wanted to exercise their full power, the same Sherman Act
power with respect to section 7 of the Clayton Act, they
could.

Everybody agrees on that.

The only question here is

did they?
MR. WILSON:

And our answer to that is, yes, they

did.
QUESTION:

And your brother's answer is, no, they

didn't.
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
That is what the case is about.

MR, WILSON:

Now, coming back just for a moment to

Mr. Justice White's question as to what kind of acquisitions
was section 7 designed to reach, well, we have in Von's
Grocery the curious parallel, I think, to this case.

Vie have

already discussing the Bennington Bank case, the whole issue
in that case, everything else was conceded, was whether the
Bennington area of Vermont was a section of the country for the
purposes of section 7.

That’s how the Congress limited the

reach of the statute in addition to limiting its reach to
corporations rather than natural persons.

market.

There were two

They had 7.5 percent of the Los Angeles

And by coincidence in this case we are dealing with

precisely the same market with which the Court dealt in that
case.

And this Court noted that in that case Congress had

passed the 1950 amendments to prevent a destruction of
competition.

It noted that the cases since the passage of that

Act have faithfully endeavored to enforce that congressional
command,, and the United States believes that the Court should
today continue to enforce that congressional command.
Let me sum up.

In our view the scope of the Clayton

Act is coterminous with thetfc of the Sherman Act, the Act which
it was designed to supplement.
Mr. Chief Justice, if I could reserve the remainder
of my time for rebuttal, I would appreciate it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

Mr. Mattson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARCUS MATTSON ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. MATTSON:
pleases

Mr. Chief Justice, and may the Court

15m not here to deny the Clayton Act i*as intended to

reach areas not reached by the Sherman Act. I'm not here to
deny that as to specifically limited transactions and specifi­
cally limited entities Congress exercised far-reaching commerce

19
powers or that they exercised all of their commerce power, only
history can tell because only ingenuity can. define how far
those powers go.

Obviously, Congress exercised its power only

with regard to acquisitions; contrary to the Sherman Act it
was every

contract.

It exercised in Clayton 7 only with

regard to corporations engaged in commerce.

Now, this Court

has already said in Gulf Oil v. Coop that that language
appears to denote only persons or activities within the flow
of interstate commerce, the practical economic continuity in
generation of goods and services for interstate markets and
their transport and distribution to the consumer.
With that legal principle, the past enforcement
pattern of the Department of Justice has until now agreed, as
Mr. Justice Powell has indicated, from page 36 of the Govern­
ment’s brief, this case marked the advent of a new policy in
the Department of Justice in the enforcement of the Clayton
Act 7.

And the fact that this policy, as stated on page 36

of the Government's brief precisely conforms with the explicit
terms of section 7, is, according to the Government's intimation,
only coincidental.

This conformity, says the Government,

simply reflects the fact that the Government has devoted its
limited enforcement resources to areas where the need is most
pressing.
The Government's new so-called application of the
statute, and I was surprised to hear that counsel now says

20
that the words that we rely on are surplusage..

But they say

in their briefs that their application is that the word3
"engaged in commerce" includes not only activities in the flow
of commerce, but also local activities that substantially
affect interstate commerce.

And those are their words.

The statute, of course, is doubly explicit to the
contrary.

Not only must the acquiring corporation be engaged

in commerce, but also the acquired corporation must be engaged
also in commerce.

The repetition of those terms demonstrates

that they were ohviousaly important to Congress.

This importance

has until not'? and for more than 60 years been recognized by the
Department of Justice as its past enforcement pattern, and
that’s what it calls it.

There are additionally important

features in the record which indicate that the new policy of
the Department of Justice was not in mind when it initiated
this case' and has not even yet given it adequate consideration.
That’s while the Government postively states, on page 36 again,
that it is true, and this is the Government’s words, it is
true that previous section 7 cases have involved both the
acquiring and acquired firms engaged in the flow of commerce.
QUESTION:

You think this was an inadvertence or

what?
MR. MATTSON:

I think that their argument they are

making in their brief and the argument they make today is
an effort to reach a problem which arose in this case, and this

21
is the first time they have used it as a means of taking
tare of this case.
QUESTIONs

But you don't think this case was brought

with the idea of reaching farther with section 7 than had been
reached before.
MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION;

I do not.

You think the idee in the first place

was that these corporations were engaged in commerce.
MR. MATTSONs

I thought perhaps they felt that —

they hardly conceived that there was anyone who had such
local operation as the Benton corporations.

They assumed

that everybody could be included within commerce.

They

didn't understand what the janitorial business was about when
they brought the case, and that's my judgment as to why this
case was brought.
Now, they say in their *—* to continue, and
this is along the line of your idea, .Mr. Justice White —they say in their brief that the Department of Justice has
never taken that position, that is, that they had a past
enforcement pattern along the lines they say that they had on
page 36 of their brief in chief.

So they go out of their

60-year history under section 7, they were able to select
only two cases to support the denial of what they said on
page 36.

One was the Bennington National Bank case.
Nov/, everyone knows that banks are engaged in

22

commerce.

That's long since been decided.

question about it.

There is no

That case doesn't indicate one way or

another.
The other is the Von's Shopping Bag case.

There

the Government proved its allegations that both the acquired
and the acquiring corporations x*ere supermarket chains and
its allegation, and I read from the complaint, "such chains
operate purchasing offices which are in contact with suppliers
located throughout the United States to purchase and effect
the shipment of substantial quantities of groceries and
related products from producing facilities located in the
various States to the chains' distribution centers and
supermarkets in the Los Angeles area.”
The facts here would not support any such allegation
and none was made.

And as Mr. Justice White asked, it is

reasonable to assume that if the Government had in mind a
new application of the statute, a new extension of the statute,
and wa3 prepared to prove it, its complaint would have reflected
these facts.

And yet you look in vain for any allegation in

this complaint that Benton, the acquired corporation, was

'

engaged in 3-ocal activities that substantially affected inter­
state commerce.

There is nothing of that in the complaint.

You look in vain for any allegation which would describe the
commerce so affected or which would state what the effect
had been.

The most that is found are the allegations in

23
paragraph 8 of fch© complaint that the acquiring corporation
maintains offices and serves customers in various States of
the United Statas, but as to Benton, tine acquired corporation,
there is no comparable allegation.

As to Benton it is

alleged only that some of its customers and some of its
vendors were engaged in interstate commerce.
..

evidences

an

This stats of

inconsistency with the Government's

new application of the statute and shows a total disregard
of the explicit jurisdictional requirements of the statute.

I mentioned that I didn't think they understood the
janitorial service business, and I think that perhaps that's
one of their basic £ail\irss in bringing this case to start
with.
QUESTIONS

You are not suggestion, are you, that if

the case went back to the district court, Mr. Mattson, and the
Government were to amend its complaint to supply theso
deficiencies and you had the same affidavits,that then the
district court ought not to deny the motion for summary
judgment.
ME. MATTSON;

No, 2 don’t think they could support

the situation at ali. I am only indicating that because there
be a
seemed to/question as to why did they bring this case at all.
My only indication is from the complaint itself they didn't
have a basis.

They made a mistake.

Now, janitors don't manufacture a product; they don't

sail a product.

Their raw material is unskilled labor which

necessarily must be obtained locally for the rendering of a
local service.

Janitors can't go into other than their local

areas to compete for unskilled labor, their raw material, or
to get it at a lower price.

A janitorial firm can, of course,

expand and go national, as the acquiring corporation did here.
Or it can elect to remain local, as Benton, the acquired
corporation, did.
Of course, janitors need mops, pails, soap, and that
sort of thing.

But these supplies are incidental and are

extensively available from local vendors, just as they are
to the .local housewives.

Benton to an extraordinary degree

limited its activities to the southern California area.

When

the Government's discovery efforts developed that Benton's
interstate purchases aggregated $140 and that its interstate
telephone calls cost only $19.78, the Government was driven
to conceding in its footnote No. 5 that Benton’s interstate
purchases were admittedly small.
Further confirmation of that fact is, and the fact
that Benton's operations were intensely local, is shown by
the fact that no officer, no employee of Benton traveled
outside of California on business.

There is every evidence

that Mr. Benton who founded the business was convinced that
if he satisfied the local people,that if he cleaned their
buildings properly, they were the ones with whom he had to

25
deal, he need not waste the firm's money on any nonessentials
connected with interstate commerce.
I think the Government also started from a false
premise as to the legislative history.

We were willing, we

would have found no necessity of going to legislative history
because this statute is explicit.

It was the Government that

went to the legislative history here.

And the unrestricted

freedom with which the Government exercised their reference
to the explicit language of section 7 is based upon a
misunderstanding of the legislative records.

The Government

persists in urging that Congress had not considered the meaning
of the words "engaged also in commerce” in connection with
section 7.

That, of course, is an unflattering conclusion

because the legislators must have known that they were putting
that language in.
QUESTION:

Suppose one of these building companies

companies, bought a couple hundred thousand dollars a year

QUESTION:

You mean directly from out of State?

Yes.

MR. MATTSON:

You would have a more difficult

question.
QUESTION:

But at least to some extent, then, they

would be engaged in commerce.

26
MR. MATTSON:

They might have then come within

part of the Government8 s contention if he could prove that
those purchases affected interstate commeres»
QUESTION:

Yes.

But for jurisdictional purposes ~

they ifould have the problem of proof about the line of
commerce, whether there would be an effect on commerce.

But

for jurisdictional purposes they would have been in commerce,

X suppose.
MR. MATTSON:

I am not prepared to concede that.

I think the words vengaged in commercen mean

that you have

a business which is day to day engaged in commerce.
QUESTION:

I think, however, that —

QUESTION :

But if instead of buying from ten

suppliers from out of State they buy from one wholesaler in
California who buys in turn all those supplies from out of
State, you say

that breaks the flow.

MR. MATTSON:

Yes, I do.

And moreover, I would say if

they bought directly, it may be that that is an incidental
part of their business.

I go back to the fact that the

janitorial business is local.

I will change my — let's assum© that

But I know you don’t agree

with that.
MR. MATTSON:

Right.

MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION:

You say that would be the legal result.

MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION %

That's the assumption, yes.

Right.

That the flow of commerce was broken

with the wholesaler.
MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, very much so.

Have you.got some Clayton Act cases,

jurisdictional cases, on that point?
MR. MATTSONs
QUESTION:

I don't think --

There aren't any, are there?

MR. MATTSON:

There aren't any.

And I think the

reason for that is that the statute is so explicit.
QUESTION:

What is the fact?

Does thin record show

28
what the fact, is where the mops and pails and things —
were they purchased from a wholesaler?
MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION5

They were purchased all in California.

Yes, I know, but from a wholesaler?

MR. MATTSON:

Or a distributor, or whatever you

might call him.
QUESTION:;

But it also shows that those distributors

buy from out of State.
MR. MATTSON:

Yes, they buy part from out of State.

The affidavits talk about a portion going from out cf State.
The closest they got was an estimate of one man who said that
40 percent came from out of State.
QUESTION:

Of the distributor’s.

MR. MATT'S ON s

Yen, the distributor’s purchases were

40 percent out of State.
QUESTION:

You don’t have any figures on what those

two maintenance companies bought, what supplies they bought
that had their origin out of State?
MR. MATTSON:

The record doesn’t show any figures

that you can point to with that regard.

Portions were.

For

instance, anybody who is in the janitorial business purchases
a lot of paper goods.

We don’t have paper forests in

California, so you’ve got the paper comes from out of State,
it came to — in soma cases it was reprocessed in California.
But it came to a wholesaler and Benton bought the paper from

29

the wholesaler.
QUESTION;

Were any of these employees, maintenance

employees, window washers who would have to go to heights?
MR. MATTSON: Oh, yes.
QUESTION:

Wear a harness?

MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I take it those came from out of State.

MR. MATTSON:

I really don’t know.

The founder of

my client was a window washer, the father of the two man who
operate the American Building Maintenance was a window washer
in San Francisco in the Bank of Aiuarica building, and he
started this business from there.

And it has expanded.

The legislative history is particularly significant
when you come to the 1950 amendments.

And mind you, in 1950

the Clayton Act 7 was extensively reviewed, and you can find
that in Brown Shoe where you spell out the extent to which
that went.

The Federal Trade Commission, starting in 1928,

proposed changes in section 7.

So I say that section 7 as

reenacted in 1950 was just like a reenactment of that statute,
and our brief will show you there were,in the seven years
prior to 1950, six bills were introduced which mentioned
affecting commerce, in other words, would have changed the
words "engaged in commerce" to "affecting commerce.w

Now

those were, as a part of section 7,in a premerger notification
proposal that was made.

And'highly significant is that in

30

1958 there ware two bills .introduced which would have provided
that if either corporation, either the acquired or th© acquiring
corporation, was engaged in commerce, the action could proceed.
Senator Sparkman was in the hearings.
proposer of one of those two bills.
bill made section 7

He was the

And he explained that his

applicable if either company was engaged

in interstate commerce.

And he explained that the existing

situation was that in cases where the acquired corporation is
engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce the enforcement
agencies lacked jurisdiction.

And Paul Rand Dixon spoke up

at that hearing and he said, the "in commerce" test is quite
different from the "affecting commerce" as you recognise.
And as late as -January of this year Congress changed the
Federal Trade Commission Act, section 5, so that it now reads
"in or affecting commerce."

But Congress; didn't at that time

embrace the opportunity to change section 7.
And

the 1950 amendments, of course, came .subsequent

to this Court's decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Brnfce
in which the Court sail, "This cane presents th® narrow
question of what Congress did, not v/hafc it could do,"
words, that's the question here..

In other

And we merely hold that to

read unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce as
though it meant unfair methods of competition in any way
affecting interstato commerce requires, in view of the relevant
considerations, much clearer manifestations of th© intention

31

of Congress then it furnished»
QUESTION:

I recall seeing a discussion of the

proportion of the total costs of the acquiring company and of
the acquired company particularly, and it's overwhelmingly
the cost of labor, is it not?
MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

It's a labor-oriented business»

Only a small percentage is the material.

MR. MATTSON:

Right.

It's 3 percent, as I recall,

of the cost that produce total gross income.
The Government's position with reference to the
legislative history is ambivalent, it relies upon post-1914
history itself,1 cn a number of pages, but would apparently
foreclose ua from doing that.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Mattson, are you suggesting in your

argument that in order to — of course, the issue isn’t here,
I take it — but are you suggesting that to satisfy the
latter part of section 7, the impact on any line of commerce,
that the impact, the substantially lessening of competition,
would have to result only from activities in commerce?
MR. MATTSON:
QUESTION:

No, I do not.

All right.

MR. MATTSON:

The commerce part of section 7 is the

first part, the "engaged in commerce."
QUESTION:

I understand that.

For the purposes of trying to foreclose ua from using
1950 legislative history, which they apparently would like to
avoid, they cite Philadelphia National Bank.

There the Court

was dealing with the assertion that after the 1950 amendment
to section 7, some Members of Congress, and for a time the

33

Justice Department —• this is quoting from the opinion —
some Members of Congress and for a time the Justice Department
voiced the view that bank mergers were still beyond the reach
of the section, as to which this Court said, the views of a
subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the
intent of an earlier one.
Now, that may have been perfectly valid there, but
here we are not presenting post-1914 legislative history for
the purpose of inferring anything into fch© statute.

We are

using the legislative history to confirm the explicit terms of
the 1914 statute and for the purpose of showing that Congress
when it reenacted the Clayton Act in 1950 had an intent
consistent with the explicit terms of the statuta and inconsisten
with the new application of the statute which the Government is
now asserting.
In Philadelphia .Bank the defendant was attempting to
avoid the language of section 7, and to use for that purpose
matters outside of section 7, like the Bank Merger Act of 1960.
The Government here is trying to do the same thing.

They are

trying to avoid the explicit language of the statute. We, on
the other hand, are supporting it.
Now, I perhaps should refer to the Standard Oil
case because that's been referred to by counsel and I think it
confirms some of the things that we have said in our briefs.
and perhaps I didn't treat it fully there.

34
The Standard Oil Company of California case confirms
cur position.

The Court there was dealing not with the narrowly

directed jurisdictional question of section 3, as we are here
with section 7.

The Standard Oil Company was obviously engaged

in commerce, there wasn't any question about it.

And under

section 3 it was necessary that only the corporation making the
contract be engaged in commerce.

The Standard Oil Company

was,the question which this Cotirt faced and determined in the
Standard Oil case was, whether the requirements contracts
lessened competition under the broadly phrased portion of the
statute.

Since the contract prevented service station

operators from dealing with suppliers from outside of California
as well as from within the State,, and because the large number
of such contracts, competition was lessened in both intrastate
and interstate.

But again that was the operative portion, not

the jurisdictional portion of the statute.
There was no issue as to whether Standard was
engaged in commerce, and the operative portion of section 3
was satisfied by extensive evidence on the structure of the
industry and the substantiality of the number of requirements
contracts.

And I think that case will demonstrate to the

Court that there has been no satisfying the requirements of
the Government’s own proposal with regard to section 7.

They

say it should read that local activities which have a substantial
effect on interstate commerce.

But they have proved no such

35
effect.

Ail they have shown is that we received money, they

said 80 to 90 percent of our revenues from interstate operators
That shows only an effect on Benton, not on interstate commerce
And they have shown nothing with regard to the structure of
any product which was bought.

They merely showed that we

bought, I think it’s $150,000 worth, according to the briefs,
I can’t find where they got that figure in the record, but
be that as it may, they have shown no market structure of any
kind with regard to any market of goods that passed into
interstate commerce before we bought them.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Mattson.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Wilson?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE B, WILSON ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I rise to make but

one short point.
It seems that page 36 of our brief is becoming
fairly notorious.

I would only wish to point out that our

enforcement policy can in no way estop what the Congress tried
to do in a statute.

Even if it's a new policy, even if this

is the first case brought, v/e do not believe it is, maybe the
first case we have brought —
QUESTION:

Has the Government abandoned the notion

that these companies were engaged in commerce?

36

MR. WILSON:

They were engaged in commerce within the

meaning of those words for the jurisdictional purposes of ■—
QUESTION:

Are you saying they were engaged in

commerce without having to rely on the effect notion?

I mean,,

you certainly argue in your brief —*
MR. WILSON:

No, I think we have to say that the

effecting commerce in any section of the country ■— in any line
of commerce in any section of the country.

That's what gets

this merger within the scope of the section 7 of the Clayton
Act.
QUESTION:
sufficiently dealing
MR. WILSON:

But you argue that these people are
directly in interstate commerce.
They were. There were certainly dealings

in interstate commerce, directly in interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

On that basis, you don't need any

redefinition of "engaged in commerce" at all.
MR. WILSON:

Well, the district court, of course,

found that those dealings were de minimis.
QUESTION:
MR. WILSON:

You don't agree with that.
We don't agree with that, but if one

accepts the district court's findings, we say that nevertheless
QUESTION:

Well, you're not abandoning your challenge

to the district court's findings.
MR. WILSON:

No, sir.

There is one case which is directly on point, a Third

37
Circuit decision in Transamerica, decided by a panel of
Judges Maris, Goodrich, and Kolodner( which deals directly
with the point at issue heres

Did Congress intend in this

statute to exercise the same full range of its jurisdictional
power which it exercised in the Sherman Act?

The court there

so held.
Just coining back to that last point —
QUESTION:,

Sto. Wilson, may I interrupt you here?

Before you sit down, would you expound a little bit on what
your response is to your opposition’s reliance on the comments
of Senator Sparkman and Member Dixon in the 1958 debate?
ME. WILSON:

Well, I think one has to come back to

a position taken fcy an. administrative agency cannot be used
subsequently to estop the intent of Congress in passing a
statute.

If the statute means what we contend it means, the

fact that we may have been mistaken and the fact that another
committee may have been mistaken and the fact that the Federal
Trade Commission may have been, mistaken in some of the positions
it has taken in the past should not prohibit a new construction,not
really a new construction, a real construction, a true
construction of the statute and its roeaning.
QUESTION:

At what point would you fix the time when

this sort of maintenance became a nationwide business on a
large scale?
MR. WILSON:

Well, I think one has to look at the

38

growth of the service industries generally.

1 don’t think#

as in the antitrust business as we deal with it every day#
one can precisely put a time —»
QUESTION:

Not precisely# but it’s something in the

last decade?
MR. WILSON:

Yes# sir# 10 or 15 years.

Thank you, sir.
QUESTION:

Pretty much the same history as, or at

least a comparable history to the private security

business

protecting industries and office buildings and things of that
kind.
MR. WILSON: I; think that’s correct# Mr. Chief Justice.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you# gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon# at 1:57, the oral arguments in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.!
