JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Odum.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. ODAM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. ODAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Please

the Court:
I am Executive Assistant Attorney General of Texas
and I am here today representing Appellants’ Attorney
General John Hill and Texas Secretary of State, Mark White
and Mr. Carol Vance, the District Attorney of Harris County,
Texas.
This appeal was taken from the judgment of the
three-judge United States District Court for the Southern
District of Texas that was entered on August the 20th of
1974.

This was an action brought by several printers seekin

to prevent disclosure of their names on certain political
advertising that they were employed to prepare.
They challenged the constitutionality of a portion
of Article 1410(B) of the

Texas Election Code which states,

"All printed or published political advertising shall also
have printed on It the name and address of the printer or
publisher and the person paying for the advertising."
QUESTION:

When was that law enacted in its present

4
form?
MR. ODAM:

The law was enacted, your Honor, in its

present form on — the amendment became effective on June
l4th of 1973QUESTION:

And when was this lawsuit brought?

MR. ODAM:

This suit was filed on September 11th,

1973, at which time local political races were being
conducted in Houston, Texas.
QUESTION:

Had the Secretary of State made any

determination or made any public announcement as to how he
construed it or how he proposed to enforce it?
MR. ODAM:

No, your Honor.

The Texas Secretary of

State had not done so, nor had there been any prosecutions
initiated or even attempted or
as evidence

even considered to that time

and the record will demonstrate.

QUESTION:

Haven’t statutes of this kind been in-

effect ih other states for many years?
MR. ODAM:

Yes, your Honor, there are approximately

33 to 36' states that have similar statutes to the one under
consideration by the Court today.
The statute vie have under consideration, however,
is unique in that only a very small number of states, I
believe three, have statutes that require that the printer
also be identified.
The statute is generally similar, however, to 18

5

use,

Section 612, which I’ll refer to later.
QUESTION:

That is requiring a sponsor to be

identified.
MR. ODAM:

That is correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Umn hum.

But only three require the

Identification of a printer.
MR. ODAM:

Yes, your Honor.

The three-judge court held that —
QUESTION:

This, I suppose, among other things,

enables the reader to trace back the material to its source,
even if the names of the sponsors are either fictitious or
meaningless to the reader.
MR. ODAM:

Is that part of it?

Yes, your Honor.

We would reach this

point, I believe, in the compelling state interest, one of
them being, as Chief Justice points out, the ability of the
voter or the candidate or any Interested citizen to be able
to determine by looking at the piece of political
advertising who printed it and then go to the printer xtfhose
address and name is indicated on the piece of political
advertising and find out exactly who submitted it for
printing and that is one of the very main reasons why the
statute was enacted.
QUESTION:

Some of the statutes require the costs

also to be indicated, do they not?
MR. ODAM:

Yes, sir.

They do —not in the Texas

6
statute, but in other states.
QUESTION :
these

That is correct, your Honor.

Are there — I don’t know whether

statutes include them but aren't there other types of

statutes which require, for example, an indication by an
insignia whether or not the printing is done by a so-called
"union printer" that is an organized printer?
MR. ODAM:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Does Texas have such a statute?

MR. ODAM:

I don't believe so, your Honor.

QUESTION:

But then, in any event, if there are,

they are independent or separate reach from this type of
statute.
MR. ODAM:

That is correct.

That is correct.

The three-judge court held the foregoing language
requiring the identification of a printer to be unconsti­
tutional In that It infringed on Appellees' First Amendment
freedoms of speech, freedom of press and the right to
assembly and said that there was no compelling state interest.
Also, the court held that the statute was void

in

that the phrase, "person paying for the advertising" was so
vague that men of common intelligence would differ as to its
meaning and application.
We present basically four fundamental points to the
Court today.
First, that the commercial printer's actions do not

7
constitute speech that is protected by the First Amendment
and even if it is protected;, the First Amendment rights to
freedom of speech and freedom of the press do not guarantee
to them the right to print political advertising anonymously.
Second, the portion of the statute in question
does not substantially infringe upon the commercial printers
and publishers’ rights to association of privacy and to the
extent that there may be infringement, which we deny that
there is or was shown in the record in the Court below, that
the state’s interest in disclosure is sufficient to justify
any infringement.
Third, assuming arguendo that the printers possessed
such rights and that they are, in fact, infringed upon, the
purposes that are served by the reasonable disclosure
requirements of Article 1410(B) further the compelling state
interest of protecting the electoral process.
And, fourth, the term "person paying for the
advertising" is not unconstitutionally void because when you
consider the statute in its entirety, any reasonable

person

exercising common sense can sufficiently understand and
comply with the requirements.
How, before expanding on these four basic points,
I believe it will benefit the Court if I very breifly comment
more on the background of the statute being challenged.
From 1967 until 1973 5 a period of six years, Texas

8
law required that political advertising, as defined in
Article 1410(B) reflect the name and address of either the
person paying for the advertising or the printer or publisher
of adver ising.
I might note at this point for the benefit of the
Court that in the Appendix which is supplied to the Court
at page 65 is a full cop1
? of the article as it appears at
the present time.
Significantly, not during the period of six years,
not once during that time, was challenge made to the term,
"person paying for the advertising" as being unconstitution­
ally vague.
In 1973s as a result of experiences by the officers
and the people of the State of Texas in which unethical and
illegal conduct in political campaigns could not be
effectively traced and thus not immediately prevented or
prosecuted, the Texas Campaign Reporting and Disclosure Act
was passed, designed to inform the public about the
financing behind communications intended to influence their
votes.
Among other reforms, the legislature changed the
disclosure requirement from the disjunctive person paying
or publisher or printer to the conjunctive, that being
disclosure to the public of the name and address of the
printer or publisher and the person paying for the

9
advertising, is the change by our legislature of only this
one word from "or" to "and" that brings us before you today.
As previously pointed out in response to Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, the amendment that we see before us today was
enacted on June 4th of 1973 and the suit was filed on
September the 11th of 1973.
There x^as no evidence presented to the court below
that the

candidate or political organizations had

declined to use the plaintiff-appellees’ commercial services,
nor that as a result, with compliance with the statute, that
the printers had been harassed or had been intimidated or
had declined to undertake any commercial political adver­
tising for fear of reprisal or loss of other business.
No political candidates appeared before the Court
below as parties or as amici.

In fact, the only evidence

before the Court was the affidavits of Individual printers
swearing to their fears of a possibility of a reaction if
they were to comply with the disclosure requirement.
No evidence xvas presented that prosecutions had
been initiated or even considered, nor evidence of how the
Act would be interpreted nor enforced by the Appellant
Secretary of State, Mark White, who is charged with the
responsibility of enforcing the uniform application of the
Texas election laws.
Parenthetically, a reading of the testimony of the

10
Appellees, only two live witnesses at the hearing at which
the temporary restraining order was denied by Judge Singleton
reveals that the testimony falls far short of establishing
any likelihood of a chilling effect upon First Amendment
rights.
To use Mr. Justice Marshall’s phrase from this
morning, the Plaintiff's counsel support their allegations
out of the clear blue sky.
They are not supported by the evidence that is in
the record in the case we have before us.
In sum, the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their
burden of proving to the court below or to this Court to
declare the disclosure provision unconstitutional,
Our first point is that the commercial printers
actions do not constitute speech as protected by the First
Amendment and even if such speech is protected, the First
Amendment freedoms of speech and freedom of the press do not
guarantee to them the right to

print political advertising

anonymously.
The First Amendment protects, not the written or
spoken word itself, but the expression of ideas concerning
the social policy, political views and religious beliefs.
Speech or conduct, however, that expresses nothing
of political or social importance Is not subject to First
Amendment protection.

11

As Judge Bue points out In his specially-concurring
opinion below, these printers, by their actions, express
nothing.

They do not argue that they are denied the right

to print anonymously their own views in support of or in
oppostion to a particular candidate.
To the contrary, they seek the right to print
anonymously that for which they have no feeling one way or
the other.
Indeed, they seek to avoid expressing any type of
conviction.

They seek constitutional protection to avoid

expressing only their name.
Nor do the printers seek to distribute ideas.

They

merely receive orders from their clientele and return the
finished product to the person that has hired their services.
The Appellees ride

very heavily on the Talley

versus California case to support their position.

We submit

that the Talley decision does not, in fact, support them and
is distinguishable from the instant case in several very
important aspects.
First, the Los Angeles ordinance requiring
identification on all handbills was struck down because of
overbreadth as to time, as to place and as to circumstance
and the lack of any relation to any ongoing Governmental
interest or responsibility.
The challenged language of Article 1410 applies

12
only in very limited terms, that being during a campaign
and only to certain groups, those printing material for such
campaigns for profit.
It clearly does not eliminate anonymous discussions
of public matters of importance at all times or even during
an election campaign.
The purposes articulated by Mr. Justice Black
from prohibiting an absolute ban on anonymous printing are
far from applicable in the case at bar.
The Appellee printers have no.such lofty purpose for
seeking anonymity.

Rather, they seek only profit in

private

Even if this were speech that were protected under
the First Amendment, as Mr. Justice Clark pointed out in his
dissenting opinion in Talley, the Constitution says nothing
about freedom of anonymous speech, rior does freedom of the
press, as illustrated in the Lewis Publishing Company case,
provide any such anonymity.
The' Branzburg decision also' illustrates that
freedom of the press does not guarantee an absolute anonymity
especially where substantial, compelling public interests
are shown and demonstrated.
As will be discussed in a later point, here the
stated interests are compelling and. when weighed ln the
scales of justice against any possible infringement, they
tilt in favor of the voting rights which our state so

13
firmly attempts to protect.
Appellants contend that the case more properly fits
within the rationale of the Insco case and the Scott case
discussed in our brief dealing with the similar federal
statute, 18 USC Section 612 which requires identification
of persons responsible for distribution or publication of
political advertisement.
Our second point deals with the asserted right of
associational privacy.

The portion of the statute in

question does not substantially infringe upon the commercial
printers and publishers rights to associational privacy.
The printers main reliance on this point is the
NAACP versus Alabama and the Bates versus City‘of Little
Hock cases.
Now, this reliance is misplaced for at least two
reasons.
First, the rationale in support of the right of
associational privacy, as they pointed out in their brief, is
to protect the right to associate, to advocate and promote
political, social and economic actions, the right to freely
associate for the purpose of advancing ideas and airing
grievances.
Ironically, the commercial printers do not seek to
protect their rights to associate with the political candi­
dates for any such reasons, as ‘made the basis for NAACP

versus Alabama and Bates but, to the contrary, they seek
to conceal their identity for fear that someone might think
that they do associate with their customers and thus damage
their commercial enterprises.
Secondly, and more importantly, the holding both
in the NAACP versus Alabama and in the Bates decision was
that in each instance the law in question imposing some
burden on a First Amendment right was not shown to have a
relevant or substantial correlation to the state interest
sought to be furthered.
In the case at bar, the substantial and compelling
interests are shown by the state in the limited disclosure
requirement of Article 1^10,
1‘he NAACP versus Alabama and the Talley case both
recognize that disclosure may be required when, as here, the
state shows good faith efforts to protect a fundamental
interest,
QUESTION:

Why does the state need the name of the

MR. ODAM:

Why does the state need to know the name

printer?

of the printer?

We feel, your Honor, that there are about

five reasons why the state needs to know the name of the
printer, all of which go to protect the voting rights of
the public.
First of all, we'd say that they need to know the

15
narae of the printer in order to give the candidate or any
other citizen a right to fairly reply to what the political
advertising is, not as prohibited by the Miami Herald case,
via access in the press.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, the man says, "My name is

Joe Doakes" and I put Joe Doakes on the bottom.
doesn’t mean I have got to print what
somebody else brings.

That

you bring me — what

Does it?

MR. ODAM:

You mean —-

QUESTION:

You put the' name of the printer, that is

all I am talking about, why do you need the name of the
printer?’
MR. ODAM:

Your Honor, if the candidate or any

person has the name of the printer on a piece of political
advertising, he can look to see who made such statements.
He can look at the piece of political advertising
and say, who made the statement?
QUESTION:

Who caused this to be?

You mean the printer?

He didn’t make

the statement.
MR. ODAM:

No, your Honor, but the requirements of

the statute are that the printer keep at his shop the name
of the individual that came to him and submitted it for
publication.
QUESTION:

Which his name is printed too.

MR. ODAM:

That is correct, your Honor, but the

16
name that is printed —
QUESTION:
say,

So you get both — you come to him and

"Is this the name?"
MR. ODAM:

No, your Honor.

Tice printer would

publish, number one, the name of the person that is paying.
That name might not necessarily be the same name as the
individual who submitted it to him.
For example, the name that he might put on a piece
of political advertising might be the "Citizens for the
Election of John Doe," the name submitted to him by the
individual.
If you, a person out in the community, wanted to
see who submitted that on behalf of the Citizens for John
Doe, knowing who the printer is, you could go to the
printer and

he would have on record who submitted it.

He would have the name of the individual.
QUESTION:
his name

He would have the name of the man that

Is on there.
MR. ODAM:

That is the only name he would have.

No, your Honor.

Under the statute he

is required to have the name of the individual which might
not necessarily be the name of the person paying.
QUESTION:

Where is that In the statute?

MR. ODAM:

It is in the portion in Article 1410 —

QUESTION:

What page?

MR. ODAM:

—■ B, which is at page 66 of the Appendix.

17

QUESTION:

Is this it?

MR. ODAM:

The Appendix to the jurisdictional

statement at page 65.
QUESTION:

I have got a jurisdictional statement.

This is it?
Now, what page is it?
MR. ODAM:

Page 66, your Honor.

QUESTION:

It is the first sentence with "the,"

MR. ODAM:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And then it is the second.

MR. ODAM:

— signed by the individual contractor

isn’t it?
It would be starting

about —

and therefore, and showing his full address and if he is an
agent, the name of the candidate, political committee or
business enterprise.
In other words, the name that is printed on a piece
of political advertising might be political committee, which
is "Citizens for John Doe."
' QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ODAM:

And if you want to find out who submitted

QUESTION:

I think then the printer should have

It ~

objection to doing the Government’s business for them.
Suppose the statute said, before you file a

18
political advertisement, you shall file with the Secretary
of State or something.

That would be one thing.

But this is getting the printer to do it.
MR. ODAM:

Well, your Honor, by having the printer-

do it, it allows the entire public during a political
campaign, to know who distributed by knowing who submitted it
to the printer.
QUESTION:
anybody that

MR. ODAM:

Okey-doke.

QUESTION:

Well, you said there were five reasons.

Now, that Is the first one.

allows the voter

What are the other four?

The second reason, your Honor, is that it
to be better-informed in casting his

ballot.
QUESTION:

Now, how in the world would the name of

the printer do that?

Any more than the name of a secretary

who typed a manuscript?
MR« ODAM:
is

Your Honor, if you know who the printer

it allows, by knowing 'who the printer is, which ties

very closely into the other point, to know who submitted
the material to be printed.

For example _

QUESTION:

Well, that is the first point.

MR. ODAM:

Well, the first point allows a candidate

19
to reply to whatever it is.
My second point is, it will allow any individual
voting in the campaign to know who submitted it.
In other words, under the first point, the candi­
date would know who submitted it and be able to reply more
directly by knowing where the piece of political advertise­
ment came from.
The second point is that any candidate

would be

better informed by knowing exactly who submitted it to the
printer.
They are more or less one and the same, but the
first is to protect the candidate or any other citizen who
might be discussed In the piece of political advertising and
the second Is to allow the voter, when looking at the piece
of political advertising, to be able to evaluate accordingly.
In other words —
QUESTION:

Not just by looking at it.

He has to

go to the printer — to the printer’s office and get it —MR. ODAM:

That is correct, your Honor.

But absent

that, he is not able to totally evaluate it.
QUESTION:

Well, all right.

two points, with a difficulty.

You say those are

What are the other three,

then?
MR. ODAM:

The third point, your Honor, is that the

disclosure will greatly deter one from attempting a

20
falsely-attributed smear, as in the Donald Segrettl case or
in the Insco cases that -were discussed in our brief.
The reason for this, I would submit, is that if a
candidate for political committee or business entity is
required and knows that they will state on a piece of
political advertising who printed it, it will deter them
from putting out a smear sheet In the first place because
they know it can be tracked doxm or at least, the first line
of defense is allowed by going to the printer and finding
out who put out the —■

How can it be tracked down if they don't

place.

are that they allow anybody interested to go to the printer’s
office and find these names that are required to be kept
there as a matter of record by the printer.
MR. ODAM:

That is correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And whether it be a member of the public

or a candidate or somebody who suspects dirty tricks, that
is really all the same need in which I fully understand
your point.

Now, what are your last two?

I©. ODAM:

The last two, your Honor, is that it will

greatly assist the officials, in checking the accuracy of
expenditure?as required to be reported under other provisions
of the Texas Campaign and Disclosure Act.
By this, candidates in Texas must, as in many
states, submit in Austin or at the district level of the

22
county exactly what expenditures they may.
Wells there is no way to check that out, if they are
registered in Austin, as to what they are and when they say
they have made these expenditures, you have to take their
word for it unless you have some other way of checking it
out.
This is not only available to state officials but
to any public official, whether they are a candidate or
anyone else, to determine exactly hoxf much was expended and
to verify whether or not that is correct.
And the fifth point, your Honor, is that before
the 1973 amendment, the printer was required to retain the
name of the contracting party.

That requirement was

virtually meaningless because, until this point, you
wouldn’t know who the printer is who is required to make
the disclosure or retain the information in the first place.
Now, taking — or assuming that that is a valid
consideration, that is, that the printer be required to
keep the name of who submitted it to him, it is meaningless
unless you are able to find out who the printer is in the
first place.
QUESTION:

So that the name of the printer is

important only because it is tied with the requirements of
subsection B here on page 26 in that, through the printer
you can get the sponsors.

23
MR. ODAM:

That is corrects, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And that is its only importance.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, too, that under Texas

libel and slander laws, the printer might be liable In some
circumstances for printing something that was grossly and
maliciously false, might he not?
MR. ODAM:

That Is correct, your Honor.

But our

purpose in passing this statute is not to enhance, necessar­
ily our libel or slander laws.

We are concerned by informing

the public at the time a political election is going on not
to —
QUESTION:

No, but that might act as a deterrent

to the publication of libelous and slanderous statements.
MR, ODAM:

Well, I believe, Mr. Justice, that

simply because that there Is —
QUESTION:

Well, no, but the idea would be, would

the printer want to be cautious about what he agreed to
print Twith his narae on it?
MR. ODAM:

I don't believe that is correct, your

Honor, because we are not only concerned about Items that
would fall as far as being libelous or slanderous, but we
are talking about in a campaign where a slight difference —
QUESTION:

In any case, you don't argue that to

deter the publication of libelous and slanderous statements,
the requirement of putting t?ne printer's name on the

publication, that may assist it.

You don't argue that?

MR. ODAM:

No, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Very wisely.

MR. ODAM:

Your Honor, these, we submit, are the

five reasons which all go to the compelling state interest
which we feel is indicated here.
In other words, if you have the freedom of speech
to say that It exists or this speech is protected, to say
that it has been infringed upon for all these reasons which
you have just discussed, we in Texas are attempting to
protect the public's voting rights to have a fair and honest
and open election.
We have cared nothing about trying to help someone
later on have a civil libel suit against someone, but the
help with one election at the time it was going on.
The states of the union are vested with a primary
responsibility lor the regulation of election processes
within their boundaries for both federal and state
Congressional elections.
The importance of the responsibility is underlined
by Article one, section four in the United States Constitu­
tion that the states have a compelling interest in preserving
the integrity and the orderliness of the election process
cannot be a matter of dispute.
The interest has its foundation in the rights of all

25
citizens, voters and candidates, to choose their governmen­
tal representatives in an orderly, fair and democratic
process.
QUESTION:
comparable

Does Texas have any statutes that require

identification of television commercials,

political commercials or radio and things like that?
MR. ODAM:

Yes, your Honor, but I think that the

point on that is that the — by identifying on a piece of
political advertising exactly who the printer is — they
are put in actual, practical parity with the television
station.

This particular statute would require —
QUESTION:

How about newspaper advertisements?

Do

they — what has to appear on them?
MR. ODAM:

Your Honor, as I recall, there is an

exemption that is put out that is the one exception to what
Mj. . c/ustioe Rehnquist asked me earlier about newspapers,
that they would not be required — since it obviously speaks
from its face who Is putting it out.
But with the

newspapers, you can look at the news­

paper ana go to the source.

You can look at the television

set and go to the source.
QUESTION:

Well, when it simply says, ''Committee

for John Jones," that is all that the newspaper advertise­
ment carries, that doesn't tell who paid for the advertise­
ment, does It?

26

MR. ODAM:

No* your Honor, but the newspaper —

QUESTION:

Does the newspaper have to keep compar­

able information?
MR. ODAM:

Yes., your Honor.

What I mean by an

exception is they are not required at the bottom of a
political advertisement —
QUESTION:

No, no, but they have to keep the same

kinds of records that the printer has to keep.
MR. ODAM:

That is correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And I gather that is both to monitor,

as you suggested earlier, the compliance with whatever the
expenditure laws of the state may be and also so it is
possible to find out who, in fact, is behind a given
advertisement.

Is that it?

MR. ODAM:

That is correct, your Honor, and they

are covered in Article 1410B under publishers or printers
referred to there.
I do not have time to go into our last point of
ideas with the void for

vagueness, but I am sure they will

cover that and perhaps I’ll have a little bit of time left
to respond to questions.
Thank you, your Honors.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD M. BIRNBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. BIRNBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
To respond, generally, to the statements which have
been made and some of the questions which would be asked,
I'd like to start with the overall concept of what is the
purpose of Article 1410B?

Why do you need the name of the

printer?
You need the name of the printer, so the State of
Texas tells us, printed on the surface of political
advertising so that individuals receiving that political
advertising can go to the printer's place and receive a copy,
a signed copy of the statement required also by Article
1410, though not in this particular, challenged provisione
I want the Court to understand’ very distinctly
that the printers have not In any way challenged the record­
keeping provisions of the Act.

All that the printers have

challenged and attacked is that provision of the Texas
Election Code which requires the printers to print their
name and address for public dissemination — for public
dissemination on the printed material.
Now, with regard to what information the public
can then get once they get to the printers, they get the
information on the form provided by Article 1410.

That

28
That information requires that the printer keep a signed
copy of the ad, signed by the person contracting there for.
Nows in answer to the question posed by the Plain­
tiffs below, what does the phrase, !'The person paying for
the advertising,” mean?

The Defendants, the Secretary of

State and the Attorney General of Texas answered in their
brief below at page four of the

brief that it was very easy

to tell who was the person paying for the advertising.
The person paying for the advertising is the
individual contracting there for and such individual’s full
name and address must appear and so forth and so on.
So in other words, the only information that you
can get by going to the printer is the information which the
state maintains must be on the face of the political
advertising itself, apart from the printer's name, namely,
the name of the person paying for the advertising.
QUESTION:

Why does the printer object to free

advertising?
MR. BIRNBERG:

The printers object because, as you

will note on the record in this case, Mr. Justice Marshall,
their experience has been that when an individual sees their
name and address associated with particular political
positions, particular political advertising, chat has dire
reprisal effects to them, that they have been exposed to
various forms of — as we have gotten in the record —

29

physical reprisals property damage, economic reprisals and
various forms of harassment and so forth when people
identify the printers with supporting by at the very least
not refusing to undertake the — advertising.
QUESTION:

I was just wondering that nine out of

ten of these brief's here, the printer always prints his
name down there.

He loves to advertise.

MR. BIRNBERG:

Absolutely, Mr. Justice Marshall.

However, the chances of the members of this court or any
other court reacting in a manner as some Texas voters do,
is not really substantial and, indeed, that is, in fact,
the problem, the identification of the printer during the
heat of a political campaign particularly, Is calculated to
cause tempers to fly, hard feelings to be felt and those
sorts of things to take place.
Nov;, there is no evidence —
QUESTION:

Has that happened to any newspapers in

Te xas ?
MR. BIRNBERG:

I assume that — yes, your Honor.

don’t know that we have any evidence of that in the record
and I wouldn’t suggest to the Court any particular factual
case but, indeed, for example, the main Plaintiff, Marion
Coleman, experienced in becoming publicly affiliated,
publicly associated, publicly known as a Republican in the
oouth o.exas area, she was beaten up and had various other

I

30

forms of reprisals directed against her.
As a result of all of that, she undertook to
formulate, once Article 1410B was announced, she undertook to
formulate for her company a policy:

Our company will not

undertake political advertising so long as we must
publicly identify ourselves and publicly disclose that we
support particular political candidates because it is
dangerous.

It causes all sorts of problems and we are not

going to do it any more.
Now, that meant that with the advent of Article
1410B —
QUESTION:

So we have got to cut out a special

rule for Texas, hmn?

.

MR. BIRNBERG:

I’m sorry, I don’t understand your

point, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

For Republicans in Texas.

QUESTION:

We’ll exercise a special rule for

Republicans in Texas.
MR. BIRNBERG:

Well, in addition, of course, to

REpublicans, Mr. Justice Marshall —
QUESTION:

I don't know how you can do that.

MR. BIRNBERG:

No, of course not, but if you con­

sider it in even th<fc more dissonant political situations,
the individual who prints for the Socialist Workers Party

31
or the American Nazi Party or the Communist Party or the
John Birch Society or any of the more dissident political
groups that the more dissident the political expression, the
less likely the printer is going to be to undertake that
advertising in the first instance if he must associate
himself openly and publicly.
Now, all we have asked is, through this suit,
aren’t there means less restrictive on the printers5
rights to associational privacy — aren’t there ways to
accomplish each and every one of these admittedly legitimate
state interests without imposing upon the printers’ rights
to political privacy, associational privacy, at least to as
severe an extent as Article 1410B does.
QUESTION:

Meaning some code designation or some­

thin ?
MR. BIRNBERG:
Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:
then?

Precisely.

For example that,

We suggest the code —
Well, would would printers have to do,

They’d be required, I take it, with some public

official?
MR. BIRNBERG:

They could be required.

They could

choose to register.
QUESTION:

And get a number or a button or something.

MR. BIRNBERG:

Right and if they chose not to

regiscer, not to get that number, they could, in that
circumstance, print the name and address.

32
Another thing, on the political advertising
but that would be no more restrictive or no more of a
licensing or a registration statute than requiring printers
in the printing business to get employer identification
numbers for internal revenue purposes so get just get a
number and use a coded bug so there is not this widespread
public dissemination of the identity of the printer doing
political work for particular individuals.
QUESTION:

Does Texas have a Freedom of Information

Act?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Texas does have a public record

statute.
QUESTION:

Well, then, someone might come in off

the street and say to the Secretary of State, "We want to
know what printer has code number 23^1."
MR. BIRNBERG:
alternatives.

Certainly.

And there are two

They might —

QUESTION:

Then why is that any less intrusive?

MR. BIRNBERG:

It is less intrusive for two

reasons, Mr. Chief Justice.

.First of all, Texas, In

designing such a coded bug system could very well put in
some sort Qf safeguard.

I am thinking in terms of the

Bank Secrecy Act case, for example, where such information
would not be available except on a showing of it being
in furtherance of or necessary to achieve one of these

33
legitimate state interests which has been expressed»
A second reason is because in that situation you
would have only the person who was legitimately interested
in ascertaining that information for whatever purpose or
reasons to track down a scurrilous piece of campaign
literature or whathaveyou instead of, every single person
who receives any piece of political advertising.
QUESTION:

Now —

Do you concede that it Is a proper state

interest to track down, as you put it, a piece of
scurrilous campaign literature?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Oh, I certainly think that that is

a legitimate state interest and I think that they can
pursue that legitimate state interest only within bounds
which are — which do not transgress First Amendment rights
of the printers or anyone else, for that' matter.
QUESTION:

Your argument Is only on behalf of the

printers?
MR. BIRNBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

You don't suggest that there is anything

wrong about the Texas requirement that there appear in the
advertisement Itself the name of the person who pays for it?
MR. BIRNBERG:
Mr. Justice Brennan.

Except for the vagueness argument,
We are only asserting the rights of

the printers in this particular case.
Now, we are not suggesting necessarily that leaving

34
the name of the person paying for the advertising is
constitutional.
QUESTION:

Is anyone here representing — or is

there any party to this?
MR. BIRNBERC-:

There is no such party in this

particular lawsuit, Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

That Issue is really not here, is it?

MR. BIRNBERG:
QUESTION:

This lawsuit —

That Issue —

That part of It.

MR. BIRNBERG:
in this particular case.

That issue is not before the Court
But there — another less

restrictive thing that Texas could do, it seems to us, would
be to pass a law making It illegal, making it a crime to
put out falsely attributive campaign literature or scurri­
lous campaign literature or libelous campaign literature
or otherwise to prohibit that.
QUESTION:

Well, don’t they have such laws?

MR. BIRNBERG:
does not.

No, Mr. Justice Marshall, Texas

Texas did have a criminal libel law until

January the 1st of 1974, at which time It was effectively
repealed and at this time, Texas has no law making It a
crime to put out a piece of so-called campaign dirty tricks
In any form or fashion.
QUESTION:

How would you know where It came from

if you simply got it and it was falsely attributed, unless

35
there was some requirement like this?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Well, there are at least two things

that I can think of, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

One of them is,

some form of a less-restrictive printer Identification
requirement such as the coded bug system, such as requiring
that the printers — and, again, I come back to the Bank
Secrecy Act case present copies of their political
advertising to the Secretary of State who has a copy of each
piece of political advertising there in his office in a
central repository sort of a scheme.
QUESTION:

With a record showing who the printer

liras?

MR. BIRNBERG:

Certainly, with records showing who

the printer was —
QUESTION:

Not even a coded bug or anything else

on the material Itself.
MR. BIRNBERG:

Without any coded bug or anything

else on the material itself.
Another thing is, presumedly, if the piece of
campaign material Is false, libelous or otherwise a subject
of controversy in the context of a political campaign, and
if the printer knows that he has been Identified
appropriately to state officials, then presumedly that
printer may well come forward and say, this was done by me.
I was the person who printed it and it was paid for by John

36
Doe or whoever else happened to be the person paying for
it.

But notice, Mr. Justice Rehnquist -QUESTION:

Wouldn't

he

be the subject of the

same reprisals that you say your client would be?
MR. BIRNBERG:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

If he comes forward voluntarily under

the pressure of this alternative system that you urge,
won't he be subject to the same sort of reprisals that you
say that your client is, under the existing law?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Probably that one printer in that

one case would be, but all of the other printers who had
undertaken to do political advertising for various
Individuals would not be exposed to'the great extent, to
the devastating extent that we have under the present law.
All the printers are desirous of doing- is Isolating
the Infringement on their constitutional rights, If you
will, is trying to tone down the devastating effect of this
1973 amendment.

I might point out —

QUESTION:

Mr. Birnberg,

I am a little disturbed

by your approach on the less-restrictiveness.

Is this

always the constitutional measure, that something might
have been done a little less r>estrictively?
MR

BIRNBERG:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, whenever the

legislature has sought to achieve a legitimate state Interest
in a manner which infringes upon the exercise of First

37
Amendment rights, then the legislature may do that only in
the way which is the least restrictive on those rights, only
in a way which is absolutely necessary In the furtherance of
the achievement of that legitimate state Interest.
QUESTION:

Of course, any imaginative lawyer can

always come up with something that is a little less
restrictive.
MR. BIRNBERG:
QUESTION:

Well —

May he not?

MR. BIRNBERG:

I am not sure that Is necessarily

the case because, obviously, Texas had a lot of imaginative
lawyers working on this particular case and they did not
suggest ~“
QUESTION:

Are you not saying that is an impossible-

to-achieve standard, when you take this position?
MR. BIRNBERG:
QUESTION:

Is it possible to achieve what?

Impossible to achieve.

MR. BIRNBERG:
Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Oh, I certainly don’t think so,
It seems to me that If —if the

presence -QUESTION:
do it?

You mean, there is never a better way to

'
MR. BIRNBERG:

There may always be a better way to

do it and In each case, the Court must consider and balance
whether or not the rights which have been infringed upon

38
have been so substantially infringed upon, that some lessrestrictive means must be adopted to accomplish the
legitimate state interest.

That is what we are urging.

So, easily, the State of Texas could have done and
could do in this very case.
QUESTION:

What you are really saying, I guess, is

that if there were no other possible way of furthering
this state end, you would have a much weaker case than you
now have because there are many other possible ways —
MR. BIRNBERG:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

— that are much more tolerable.

MR. BIRNBERG:

I would go further than that,

Mr. Justice Stewart and say if there were no other reasonable
j

way to —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BIRNBERG:

— do it, then, certainly, our

position would not be as strong as it is.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BIRNBERG:

But there are several other

reasonable ways to accomplish each of these legitimate
state interests without burdening the printers’ rights to
""political —
QUESTION:

Which you argue would be much less

intrusive upon your First Amendment rights?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Absolutely, Mr. Justice Stewart.

39
QUESTION:

Are you going to address your friend's

argument that the act of printing is — If I understood him
correctly — the act of printing these documents is conduct
since it doesn't express any ideas of any kind of the
printer?
MR. BIRNBERG:
ways.

Well, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, two

First of all, I will address the Court to the very

lengthy and, I think, scholarly dissertation of Judge Singleton on that precise issue, with all of his citations In the
opinion for the court below on which the three Judges
unanimously declared the law unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Secondly —

Except that I gather that Judge Bue

didn't think of the First Amendment rights of the printers
as much as the First Amendment rights of those who were
responsible for having the —
MR. BIRNBERG:

That is certainly true and the

result, of course, Mr. Justice Brennan, is still the same,
that —
QUESTION:

It may be, but —

MR. BIRNBERG:

— in Mr. Justice Bue's opinion,

this law Is an unconstitutional Infringement on —
QUESTION:

'f.es,

but he didn't think there were any

First Amendment rights of the printers.
MR. BIRNBERG:
not.

Of the printers.

We disagree with that view.

He certainly did

Understand also that there are two First Amendment
rights that we are talking about here.

One of them Is the

right to print anonymously and I think that is the issue
to which my colleague Is addressing himself and suggesting
that the printers have no such right, that they are merely
commercial conduits and we point out that as a practical
matter and as an historic matter, if the printer — if the
person who operates the printing press does not have First
Amendment protection coexistent with that enjoyed by the
author, that the whole purpose and scheme of the First
Amendment is frustrated.
QUESTION:

Secondly, however —

Well, the issue is nonetheless the

right to print someone else's views anonymously that you
are claiming.
MR. BIRNBERG:

We are claiming — yes, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, the right to undertake to print what we choose to
print and not to choose what we don't want to print.
That is, a statement of our name and address.
is, the printer's name and address.

That

That raises, of course,

a fomi 11 o-type issue where the state has told the printers
you must print your name and address on political advertising.
So we point out to the Court, by the way —
QUESTION:

Well, what about the newspaper?

What

about the federal statute that requires that a newspaper —
every newspaper to print the name of the publisher and so

41
forth?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Mr. Justice Rehnquists that is only

to the extent that the newspaper desires and chooses to
avail itself of second class mailing
QUESTION:

rights and —

Well* but Justice Holmes long ago said

the Government has a right to run a mail service but it
doesn't have a right to run it In violation of the First
Amendment.

I wouldn't think that is any distinction.

MR. BIRNBERG:
that law is Lewis — the

I believe that the case that upheld
Publishing Company versus Morgan
\' f

a 1913 case and that is precisely the problem Is that
Mr. Justice Holmes’ position was not accepted in that case
but the Court said In that case that Congress has, under
Article I Section 8, plenary power to control the postal
service and, therefore, anyone choosing or desiring to
avail themselves of lower postal rates — lower postal
rates may be required to forego to some

extent First

Amendment rights and I think —
QUESTION:

Hasn't that been swallowed up by the

obscenity cases on the mailing problem?
MR. BIRNBERG:

I certainly think it has, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, then your point vanishes.

MR. BIRNBERG:

Well, whether the point vanishes —-

the point Is that there is no constitutional -- there is no

42
judicial pronouncement of the efficacy of that law that
exists and is viable today.
Lamont versus Postmaster also seems to have
suggested that that 1913 ruling is no longer viable law.
I would ask the Court, I would direct

the Court's

attention to the fact that political advertising in Texas is
very broadly construed.

It is saying anything that — it is

any form of expression — anything published in a newspaper,,
magazine or journal or any pamphlet, handbill or other
printed matter or anything broadcast over a radio or
television station or displayed on a billboard in favor of
or in opposition to any candidate for public office or other
office of a political party or in favor of or in opposition
to the success of any public office holder or in favor of
or in opposition to any proposition submitted to a vote of

4

-

the people, whether1 It has been previously submitted,
whether It is to be submitted some time in the future,
4

whether it has been proposed to be submitted.
So, virtually, any discussion about political
matters which is reduced to printed or published form must
carry the printer identification requirement.
I would suggest to the Court that Mr. Hamilton —

Alexander Hamilton —• would have to have had the name and
address of his printer printed on the Federalist Papers.
would suggest to the Court that — that John Jay would

I

43
similarly have had to.
I would therefore urge the Court to affirm the
ruling below of the three-judge district court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Birnberg.

You have three minutes left, Mr. Odam.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. ODAM, ESQ.
MR. ODAM:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
QUESTION:

What about the alternative methods?

MR. ODAM:

YOur Honor, as far as alternative

methods are concerned, I believe that —
QUESTION:

Well, would the state’s interests, all

five of them, be as well-served by a coded —
MR. ODAM:

Your Honor, I would fear to hear what

Mr. Birnberg’s suggestion would be if the State of Texas
were to require printers to come In and Identify themselves
before they undertake any type of registration.
I believe that you have more serious constitutional
problems a s far as prior registration if a coded bug system
were to come into play.
Another alternative, as they suggest, is a ™ some
type of central repository where every type of political
advertising from throughout the entire State of Texas — a
copy of such is sent somewhere.
Legislature certainly has a right in considering

44
alternative methods — if they want to have such central
repository, are allowed to have to the voter — which we
are most concerned with, a compelling state interest to
protect the voter's right, to let the voter know when he
looks at a piece of political advertising who printed it.
Now, that is what we are concerned about, the
alternative means, therefore, to answer your question would
not accomplish this purpose.
QUESTION:

I suspect that if they had this coding

system that we'd be confronted with an argument that this
was, In effect, a disguised licensing of printers.
MR. BIRNBERG:
case, your Honor.

I am sure that that would be the

It would — again, the bug system, the

coded system, would not avail to the voters to know — and
as the Chief Justice points out, it would come into the
licensing, prior licensing before they could even go Into
effect.
The only two closing points I would make«, your
Honor, would be, number one, that the evidence before this
Court such as opposing counsel has referred to, was not a
part of the record at the three-judge court.
The reference Is made to the problems that the lady
had, with regard to her feelings about supporting a Repub­
lican candidate.

That was at the temporary restraining

order but was not a part of the record at the three-judge

45
court hearing.
Again, this record is void of law to support the
position as well as the facts as developed in this record,
when considering the record as a whole and therefore, we
respectfully pray that this Court reverse the decision of
the three-judge court below.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE EURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:09 o’clock p.m., the case
was submitted,]
