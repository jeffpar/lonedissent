p ROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vie will hear arguments

first this morning in 73-1016, Lascaris against Shirley
and 73-1095, Lavine against Shirley, consolidated.
Mr. Rubenstein, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN W. RUBENSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These are consolidated appeals which present
fundamental issues basic to the Aid for Dependent Children
Program.
Broadly stated, the issue is, can a parent or
caretaker-relative refuse to cooperate in state efforts to
obtain support for a child from its father where that child
is receiving AFDC benefits and the further question is, can
that parent still claim benefits as a parent or relative
upon her

refusal to so cooperate?
The decisions of the lower courts, starting with

Doe against Shapiro, a Connecticut Federal District Court
case in 1969, has consistently held that where a mother and
chil^ have been denied assistance by states, for the mother's
failure to cooperate, assistance may net be terminated to
the mother and child.

4
This Court3 in three summary affirmances, affirmed
the principle enunciated in Doe against Shapiro, that early
case.

These are Doe against Swank, Meyers against Juras,

and Taylor against Martin.
Of course, the summary affirmances didn’t deal
explicitly with anything, they were just that and I didn't
mean to convey anything else.
State attempts to discontinue grants of the mother
only were invalidated by federal courts in Connecticut in
Doe against Harder, the successor to Doe against Shapiro, in
which the State of

Connecticut had amended its regulations

to cut off benefits to the mother only.
Commissioner Harder was held in contempt.

He

appealed to this Court but pending appeal, he was purged of
contempt by changing the regulations and the Court has dis­
missed that appeal for want of jurisdiction.
Ir, had dismissed the appeal in Doe against Shapiro
the earlier case, for late docketing,with two justices
dissenting.
Also, other courts in Pennsylvania, Iowa and New
York have followed the lead of the Harder court and held that
assistance may not be denied to the mother for the failure
to cooperate in state efforts to establish paternity or to
secure support for her child.
The result of these decisions halting state efforts

to terminate the grant of the mother for her failure to
cooperate have been that the state has been unable to comply
with the provisions of the

Social Security Act, that the

intent of Congress to require such parental cooperation has
been frustrated, that the APDC system has been turned upside
down, putting the mother in the driver's seat rather than the
state agency, that people who should contribute to APDC
support, thereby reducing need, are not contributing and
that the ancient duty of parents to support their children
has been shifted to the state and to the local social services
district, contrary to the provisions of the Social Security
Act.
Now, Mew York’s interest in this litigation and
that of its social services district is legitimate and
substantial.
The place of residence of APDC fathers in

New York

State is unknown to the case worker, it is believed, in some­
thing over 50 percent of the cases.
It is anticipated that the state locals and local
shares combined for fiscal year 197^, under the matching
formula for APDC will amount to something more than $700
million in New York State and we submit that the state should
have every opportunity to reduce what is becoming a staggering
cost and has been a staggering cost for a number of years
by pursuing every avenue open to them to require these

fathers to contribute to the support of their children.
Movr, as originally instituted, this case involved
claims of the mothers that the county agency had required
them to cooperate in instituting and prosecuting nonsupport
proceedings tinder a state departmental regulation requiring
that they furnish pertinent information in the location and
prosecution of a deserting or abandoning parent, that the
noncooperative parent was inelegible for public assistance
but the grants for her children were continued.
It was only

the mother who was discontinued.

While in appeals pending to this Court from the
order of the -» on the original hearing which declared the
state regulation violative of the Social Security Act to
the extexit that it requires parents or relatives to insti­
tute and prosecute nonsupport actions, Mew York Social
Services Law Section 101-A was amended to insert therein a
new subdivision 2 and 3*
Mow, these require that a recipient of public
assistance — it is not limted in its application only to
Aid to P milies with Dependent Children.

It is a statue of

general application but, obviously, in this case, we are
talking about Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
The statute requires that the recipient of public
assistance assist and cooperate with a social services
official In obtaining support or support contributions from

7
the other parent by furnishing of the social services
official with appropriate information, including the location
of the other parent or spouse by filing a petition and
furnishing evidence in a proceedings for paternity and
support or for nonsupport.
But if the applicant fails to file the petition,
nothing happens except that the social services official is
required to do so.
Then, if the applicant fails to furnish evidence
necessary to support a petition for paternity and support or
for nonsupport in a marital situation, or if the person fails
to furnish information relative to the location, of the other
psrent, her maintenance can be discontinued for her x^ilful
failure to do so so long as she fails to assist and cooperate
as required by the statute and only so long as she fails to
assist and cooperate.
The children's grant continues.
Now-, because of the amendment to Social Services
Law Section 101-a, this Court remanded for further consider­
ation and after remand, the original plaintiffs below moved
to reconvene the three-judge court to amend the complaint and
for intervention by an unwed mother.
There had been no unwed mothers in the case before
that time.
The three-judge court permitted intervention and

6
amendment of the complaint.

The amended complaint, however,

dealt only with the claim of the intevenor-unwed mother, who
had refused to tell a social servioes official where the
known father of one of her children was, within a geographi­
cal area.
They knew who he was.

She had told them that but

she said, ,!I won't tell you where he is in this tox<n in
Western Hew York,” and the amended complaint -- I have to
talk about this just for a moment.

It is not the stated

claim for the original plaintiffs and since the Court had
remanded, we were not frankly sure whether this Court would
still ccnsider the original plaintiffs to be viable
appellees on this appeal.
In any event, it appears that the intervenor is
an automatic appellee here and counsel has quite correctly
included her in the title of his papers as an intervenor
appellee but we did not amend the title of the action because
the court below didn't and this was a matter which we must
leave entirely to the Court, of course.
The three-judge court, after the remand, in its
memorandum decision and order, declared Section 101-A as
amended, of the Hex* York Social Services Law, void,
unenforceable and without effect insofar as it makes
recipient cooperation in a paternity

or support action

against an absent parent a condition of eligibility in AFDC

o
and the Court below enjoined the defendants in that case,
the state and county officers, from terminating assistan.ce
to the intervenor for her minor children for failure to
cooperate in obtaining support.
The order on the second argument did not act upon
the original plaintiffs at all.
How, if the original plaintiffs

for whom no claim

was stated in the emended complaint -- which was actually
an intervenor’s complaint, we believe, deemed by the Court
to still be in the case, the question presented is whether
an AFDC parent or caretaker must assist or cooperate in an
nonsupport proceeding instituted by a social services
official.
As to the intervenor, the question presented is
whether she may be required to furnish the location of the
father of one of to? children to the social services officia.1
and as I say, prior to the intervention of this unwed mother,
we

had no paternity aspect of this case whatsoever but as it

stands before the Court now, it has both nonsupport and
paternity support aspects depending upon the court construc­
tion of its own remand.
How, we contend that the Hew York statute furthers
the provisions of the Social Security Act.
as that.

It is as simple

The appellees contend that the statute creates a

condition of eligibility not provided for in the Social

10
Security Act and to that vfe answer, we don’t think it

does

but even if it does, the Social Security Act not only allows
for state efforts to abstain support and establish paternity
but requires such action and that the statute is within the
legitimate sphere of state administration and is necessary
to the proper administration of the AFDC program.
The state statute does not violate any specific
provision of the Social Security Act, but rather is friendly
to and furthers the provisions of the Act.
This Court discussed the statutes, the provisions
of the Social Security Act

that are involved on this appeal

in its decision in King against Smith when it was in
connection, of course, with the Alabama Man-in-the-House
Rule.
The Court set out these statutes, federal statutes
to which I'll allude in a moment, and said — this is at
392-U.S. 332 — "The pattern of this legislation could not
be clearer.

Every effort is to be made to locate and secure

support payments from persons legally obligated to support a
deserted child.”
And later on in the same page, ,!The provisions
seek to secure parental support in lieu of AFDC support for
dependent children."
That is exactly what New York is trying to do.
New York's Social Services law, Section 101-A

11
2 and 3 implements the provisions of Section 402*-a? 17, of
the Social Security Act.

It implements the provisions of

Section l\.02-A 7 of the Social Security Act.
Section 40 2-A-17 requires — I am reading from
page 46 of my brief, the Appendix — that a state plan must
provide for the development and implementation of a program,
under which the state agency will undertake, one, in the
ease of a child born out of wedlock who is receiving

Aid

to Families with Dependent Children to establish the
paternity of such child and secure support for him and, two,
in the case of any child receiving such aid who has been
deserted or abandoned by his parents, to secure support for
such child from such parent or from any other person legally
liable for such support, utilizing any reciprocal code
agreements adopted with other states to obtain or enforce
court-ordered support.
And Section 7 — 402-A 7 provides that the state,
in determining need, shall take into consideration any other
income and resources of any child or relative claiming Aid
to Families with Dependent Children.
How, subsequent —
QUESTI®:

Well, could you -- could Hew York

disqualify this child for this reason?
MR. RUBENSTEIN:
provide for that, sir

No, in fact, the statute does not

QUEST I ON:

You mean, your statuite?

I®. RUBES ST EXIT:
QUESTION:

That is night.

But what if it did?

Would that pass

31 uster?
MR. RUBENSTEIN;

Well, I think we would have a

difficult time establishing that.
QUESTION;

Wouldn’t you run. into the cases that

say that a state can’t establish any

additional qualifi­

cations?
MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION;

Well, we'd run in

perhaps we—

At least for the child.

MR. RUBENSTEIN;

At least for the child.

The

child is not, really involved and, of course, the statute
says,,, in the case of a child born out of wedlock who is

receiving assistance — so, I -- X wouldn’t care to•specu­
late -«• if your Honor will permit
QUESTION:

as to —

Well, how do you handle the cases that

say these states may not establish additional requirements
for eligibility?
MR, RUBENSTEIN:

Well, this Court, in Dublino and

in Townsend against Swank, laid down various ground rules.
If 'the statute is within a legitimate sphere of state
administration, as long as it doesn't conflict with any
substantial provision of the Social Security Act, the state’s
provision is all right.

13
If it doesn't — and isn't that basically it,
Mr. Justice White?

This is an area where the statute expressly
Xjrovides the state shall have a program for determining
the paternity of children and getting their support.
QUESTION:

So you are saying that the condition

of the state law is either expressly or impliedly found in
the Social Security Act itself?
MR. RUBEN STEM:

Absolutely.

We say we are

authorised to do it and we are required to do it.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that this is

comparable to a state provision that if employment Is
° ffered which does not interfere with child care that the

mother must take the

employment?

MR. RUBEN STEM:
QUESTION:

Well

In order to continue her benefits, not

the child's benefits.
MR. RUBEN STEM:

Well, it is along that same

general line of reasoning, that a person, as this Court safi
said in Wyman against James, a person should not be able to
get ADC on her own informational terms and that, I think,
is what we are talking about.
This woman —
QUESTION:
interview?

Is that the one where she refused the

MR, RU3EHSTEIN:

The home visitation, yes, sir.

And that, I think, is where we are at.

The statute provides

that we have to have tills program for developing and
implementing a program to get this support and to establish
paternity and the woman — what happens is, the woman
baulks and won't give you the information.
Now, she is the only one who has this information
and, certainly, in paternity oases, it is very difficult to
establish paternity by any testimony other than the woman —
by any evidence other than what she might give and it is
very difficult if the father has run off, as has happened
in so roany agency cases, to locate — to obtain support
unless the mother will cooperate in your efforts to do so
and this, it seems to us, is the same type of situation as
the Court ran into in Wyman against James and Wyman against
James has been the

has troubled many courts because it

went on constitutional grounds.
It went on the Fourth Amendment grounds.

There

have been a substantial number of cases in this area of non­
support and Wyman against James went on constitutional
grounds and it wasn’t until the Court's decision in Duhlino
that the Court said that that type of activity was within
the legitimate sphere of state administration and had the
courts known — the lower federal courts known at the time
that they were deciding these cases, that the Court was

15
ready to say that in Duhlino, perhaps the decisions would
be wrong.

We are in a difficult situation.
We come in hare with the status of the case law

based upon this Doe against Shapiro concept that this Court
has never been adopted — that it has never adopted — that
the only conditions of eligibility are need and dependency.
We come in with a series of cases where the judges
have been troubled by Wyman, against James by the covirt's
holding and Judge Clary in Doe against Shapiro was troubled
by it.

He thought it was square authority for discon-tin' f

.

uance of the mother and the child end Judge Markowitz, 1
think in Doe against Swank, was troubled with it and Judge
Meacham, in Sal2 v. Hernandez, the on3.y case at the federa.1
level that X know of that went with us, was troubled by it
and that case was vacated and remanded on appeal because the
Appellate Court held there should be a three-judge court
and on remand, they followed this Court’s affirmances in
Taylor against Martin and Meyers against Juras and the like
and they held the states could not do it and this has been
a constant source.
In the New York case of La.scari s v. 'Wyman, in

67

miscellaneous, a very early case involving a completely
different factual situation, the court held that this
disagreed with Doe against Shapiro and followed the teaching
of Wyman against James that this type of activity was

1

16

permissible and the only other ease that I know of that I
haven’t cited because I haven’t been able to find it, is a
State of Washington case cited in paragraph 1240 of the
Commerce Clearinghouse Poverty reports, a Superior Court
case in Kings County, Doe against Smith, back in 1970 which
xiras on our side of the fence.
But our point is, sir, that the statute is clear
that the states have to do something about this problem of
illegitimacy and about this problem of nonsupport.
QUESTION:

You said it is some $700 and some-

million a year that is —
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Well, it is estimated that — the

state department social service estimates that its — that
the cost — I have to say that the AFDC program is not
budgeted in the New York State budget as

separate public

assistance items.
Mew York has other public assistance programs and
it has a total budget for the programs, as I understand it,
but the Department estimates that the cost to the State of
New York during fiscal year 197^ and ’75 will be $358 million.
Now, the cost of that is doubled because the local
shares are equal to the state shares so the counties and
the cities pay another $358 million.

That’s an awful lot of

money.
And New York is — back in 1972 added this Section

17
101-A to attempt to — I believe the memorandum in support
of it is attached to the Appendix B in my brief on the pre­
mise that federal law permitted this type of action.
QUESTION:

How many other states have an analog to

101-A?
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Oh, I don’t know if I can answer

that.
QUESTION:
most of them?

I don’t care about precisely, but do

Or do —

MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, there has been —

— a handful of them, or what?

MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Well, 101-A — all that I know

about is Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New York end there
was a recent case out in Utah, Rose against Bampton, I believe,
in June of 197^ which I just found the other day and those
are the only ones I know about and Rose against Bampton has
followed the teaching of the Shirley court that you couldn't
do this and we believe that the Social Security Act specifi­
cally gives us authority to do it.
Now, the Federal Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare has filed a regulation supporting our right to
do this which is cited in our brief.
QUESTION:

That was done after you did it, wasn't

it?
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

That was done later, yes, after

18
the court's remand.
QUESTION:

And at- your behest.

MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION:

No.

Not yours personally, but at the

Commissioner’s behest, wasn't it?
HR. RUBENSTEIN:

Let me say this.

I believe that

Oregon filed an objection.
Of course, there was proposed rule-making as In
every case and a notice and the State of New York filed
objections.

Iowa filed objections and I believe Oregon

filed objections, maybe California, as to what happened up
in — there had been representations in the briefs that we
requested that — I — don’t think that I have any right to
talk about that because I wasn't privv.y to those conversa­
tions .
Of course, the states deal with the administrators
all the time and I wouldn't — I think that is an unfor­
tunate characterization in counsel's brief, but I don’t think
I could comment on it.
Have I answered your question, sir?
QUESTION:

Well, or at least explained why you

couldn't answer it.
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Now, the Federal — we think the

Federal statutes and regulations and the state

statute are

recognition of the basic and primary duty of the parent duty

19
to support his child.
And we think what is wrong with the whole picture
is, that when you don’t give recognition to that duty, it
turns the situation around so that the state is required to
support the child and determine its support when the parentshould be doing so and we don’t think that Congress has
ever expressed an intent that this should happen and we
think that the statute itself is evidence that the intent
was to the contrary.
QUESTION:

How long has this been your policy?

MR. RUBENSTEIN:
know when that was adopted.
1972.

Well, the regulation — I don't
The statute was adopted in

It was enacted in '72, the one that vre are upon now.
QUESTION:

And prior to that?

MR. RUBENSTEIN:

It would have been some time after

1970, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, you didn't impose this

condition prior to 1970, or f72?
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

I do not — it was in a state

regulation but I do not believe there was any provision
in the state regulation to impose such a condition prior to
Las caris against Wyman in 67 miscellaneous.
QUESTION:
contrary to HEW
HEW regulations?

Was this state condition a policy

20
HR. RUBENSTEIN:

HEW had taken the position that

had spoken to the provisions of 402~A(11), the NOLEO require­
ment, the notice to law enforcement officers requirement
and it had taken the position there that it had advised the
states against establishing —
QUESTION:

A condition.

MR. RUBENSTEIN:

— a support requiring coopera­

tion as a condition because of the wording of the statute
that a child has received ADC but it did not.
I believe it is part 8149 of the Handbook.
not say you can’t do it.

It did

It just advised against it.

But

I should mention that these provisions were held in the
Doe against Shapiro to have been superceded by the provisions
of 602-A — 402-A(17) enacted in 1917 and I don’t believe
that the Secretary has spoken to that provision prior to —
QUESTION:

The amendment of his regulations.

MR. RUBENSTEIN:

The amendment of his regulations.

There have been two regulations, part 220 — I believe — .48
leading to the establishment of paternity which was recently
revised in July of 1974 in the Federal Register.
QUESTION:

Well, under the new regulations, New

York's regulation is permissible.
MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And yet the district judge held it, and

I guess — or, it was held, wasn’t it — invalid?

21
MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION:
statute.

Yes , he did.

Because it was inconsistent with the

I have nothing here .from HEW from the government,

except urging us to take the case at the time the appeals
were filed,

They haven’t given us anything else, have they?

MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION:

No, I don't believe they have.

They haven't addressed this holding that

the amendment was invalid?
MR, RUBENSTEIN:

Well, other than in their brief

on the jurisdictional question I haven't seen anything from
them.
Now — and by the way, I should tell the Court
that the provisions of the state law relating to the NOLEO
provision, 602-A(ll), 402-A(ll) found in Social Services law
111 352 and 352-A and 372-A also has some involvement as do
part 347 of the state department regulations.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are now using what­

ever time you may want to reserve for rebuttal.
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Well, in that case, I think I'll

have to stop and just say to the Court that — that we don’t
think that the statute was ever intended to enable this
woman to come in on her own terms and get assistance, that
she has a duty to help us determine the resources, that
Congress has always spoken in terms of support as a resource,
as in our brief and there is only one other word

that I

22
viant to throw out.

As I was reading ray brief last nights

talking about the legislative history of 602-A(17)* I found
fairly
I was reading about two separate but /
similar bills that
were before the Congress and I hadn't realized that and I
want the Court to know that.
Thank you.

I'll reserve the remainder.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS A ELDRIDGE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
QUESTION:

Mr. Eldridge, this may be premature

but I hope that at some point in your argument you may say
something about whether — if this HEW amendment were valid,
whether you have any case —
MR. ELDRIDGE:

There are two HEW regulations,

Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

Well, I am speaking of the one —

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

That coex:5-sts at this point.

Yes.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

This latest regulation, which is

233.90(B)(4) I believe.
QUESTION:

Well, wait a minute.

These numbers get

me all confused, 233.90 is the one that was adopted on
May 3, '73.

Is that it?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

That Is correct.

Where are these pages?

23
QUESTION:

Page 28 of the jurisdictional statement

in the Lavine case.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Thank you.

QUESTION: 1095.
MR, ELDRIDGE:

That purports to allow a state to

exclude a mother if she fails to cooperate in the prosecution.
QUESTION:

Then aid is denied to the uncooperative

caretaker of —
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That is correct.

There coexists

with that regulation another regulation of HEW, 233-90 — is
that it?

Let me see?
QUESTION:

Mow, where can we find that one?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Okay,

Well, I thought this amendment was an

amendment to 23390,
MR. ELpRIDGE:

235 page 70, which still exists.

It is referred to in the brief — in my brief at page 2 and
page 21.

I don’t believe that it is fully set out there,

however.
QUESTION:

Is it set out in the jurisdictional

statement on behalf of Appellant Lavine on page 28
V.

under

It says Section 233*90 is amended by adding to paragraph

V a new subparagraph 4 as set forth below and then B, is that
it?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Let me see.

Page

3,

is that?

QUESTION:

Page 28 of the jurisdictional state­

ment on the part of Lavine.

Go down toward the bottom of

the page and the smaller print.

It says Section 233-90 is

amended by adding to paragraph B a new subparagraph 4 as set
forth below.

Is that what you are talking about?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Yes. that is the change of 235.

And it says a child may not be denied

APDC initially or subsequently.
Then, moving over to ~~ and then it says, 4, a
child may not be denied AFDC either initially or subse­
quently — I am on page 29 now —
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Right.

Because a parent or caretaker relative

fails to assist in the establishment of paternity of a child
born out of wedlock or in seeking support from a person
having a legal duty to support the child.

Is that what you

are talking about?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Nonetheless, there still exists

235.
QUESTION:

I know that.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

Which says that ‘it is not legal.

QUESTION: I know.

So what do we — how do we

reconcile this?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Well, I submit to you that HEW, in

promulgating this regulation did so without the authority

25
of the Congress.

I think the intent of Congress —

QUESTION:

Well, you mean both regulations or what?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

The first regulation — perhaps vie

can deal with it in subject matter terms — said that you
cannot cut off a parent or a child.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

It is not a condition of eligibility

for APDC.
QUESTION:

The original 233-90?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

That has been the view of HEW since

1951 when this first started.
QUESTION:

It wasn’t in that first regulation,

was It?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

There was no condition of eligibility

ever in a regulation of HEW until 1973QUESTION:

I see.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

Until this amendment.

That is correct.

came suis ponte from the HEW segment.

And this amendment

It did not come from

any Congressional —
QUESTION:

Which amendment are you talking about?

This is very confusing.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry.

Because there are two inconsistent ones.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

The latest amendment, the 1973

amendment, which purported —

26
QUESTION:

What number has that one got?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

The one we just read part of.

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

That is 233.90(B)(4).

That is correct.

That is correct.

And what about that one?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

233.90 purported to allow a condi­

tion of eligibility.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

For the parent.

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

For the parent only.

Not for the child.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

Not for the child.

But it did so

without any Congressional encouragement to do that.

There

had been no legislation passed —
QUESTION:

But isnft that true of all regulations?

I mean, they are made by the agency, not by Congress.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That is right.

correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I believe that is

But they have authority

only if they comport with the intentions of Congress.
QUESTION:

But what about —

QUESTION:

Well, it is expressed in statute.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

As expressed in the statutes and

in this — in the Social Security Act, there is an extensive
scheme, the NOLEO scheme, set out to achieve support for
AFDC children and parents but in that scheme, there is no

27

condition of eligibility.
QUESTION:

What about Justice Brennan's question?

Let's assume this regulation is valid.
QUESTION:

Which regulation?

QUESTION:

The Amendment.

QUESTION:

The Amendment, the one — the B(4) —

QUESTION:

The B(4) that we have just referred to,

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Okay.

All right.

Suppose that is valid.

Now, let's

assume that is valid.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Then there is a constitutional

question, an —
QUESTION:

That is what I am trying to get to.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

— equal protection problem.

It

has not been dealt with in any of these cases heretofore
because of the Court’s teaching —
QUESTION:

But the Issue here then would be

decided against you, the statutory issue.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I don’t believe that there is

support in the statute to decide it against me.

If you

decided that the regulation was proper —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

— that it reflected the intent of

Congress —
QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

28
HR. ELDRIDGE:

— then you could carve an exception

to the Townsend versus Swank approach that need and depen­
dency are the conditions of eligibility because —
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that that is an

exception, but, assuming the regulation is valid, the
statutory issue would be decided against you, I take it.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

The statutory issue would then —

what would remain would be the constitutional issue, the
equal protection issue.
QUESTION:

And so the case does pose the validity

of this regulation.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:
does, although

Yes, it does.

And, a.s a matter of fact, I expect it

the government is not represented here, in

light of the holding of the District Court, that the amend­
ment was invalid.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

The District Court said that the

amendment was not a guidepost to be followed judicially.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought it went beyond that.

It said, "As for the department'3 new interpretation, cer­
tainly may not be termed settled or consistent nor may it
be said that the agency was never of a contrary opinion,"
and it goes on and says, "The unbroken line of court
decisions construing these provisions and the absence of any
Congressional corrective action persuade us that the agency’s

29
new interpretation is in error and not a guidepost to be
followed judicially.”
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Isn’t that a holding that it is invalid?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I believe it is, yes.

Because it is not a — well, it affects —

as the statute does not otherwise permit a condition of
eligibility.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

That is correct and that is —

But we have to reach it although the

government is not here.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Well, they were invited by

Court to speak to the issue.
QUESTION:
the case.
merits.

this

They presented —

All they did was say we ought to hear

They didn't come in — they never came in on the
At least, I have nothing here from it.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I can’t explain their absence,

Mr. Justice Brennan.
As we can see, though, the law has been settled.
There are 20 federal district courts that have decided on
this statutory ground.
There are three affirmances of this Court.

I think,

to paraphrase Justice Brandeis, not only is the lav/ settled,
it is settled right.
QUESTION:

Did they all relate to taking the support

30

away from the mother or the child?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

They — initially — well,

actually, each one of them varied.
ambiences to each one.

There were different

I think the issue was really the

same but I think the distinction between —
QUESTION:

The eases were not the same issue as

we have got presented here though, x^ere they?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Well, in the three affirmances of

this Court, in Meyers v. Juras, the mother was, I believe,
cut off.

The mother and the children were terminated in

Meyers versus Juras.
In Taylor

versus Martin, the child was ineligible.

In Doe versus Swank, the mother was terminated.
So they varied.
No, they did not cut the mother in Doe versus
Swank, they cut the child in Doe versus Swank.

They cut

the child in Doe versus Swank because the grandmother would
not sue her daughter for nonsupport.

The daughter was the

mother of the child but the grandmother was the caretaker
for it so xire move around in circles of consanguinity here.
I would submit though, Mr. Chief Justice, that
the distinction between terminating a mother and a child is
really a chimera.
What you have as a result of cutting any one
member of the unit is a net reduction in welfare.

The

31
mother is, by terms of the AFDC statute, a carec-ai-cerorder for her to continue to take care, she has to maintain
herself.
In other words, she has to eat and she has to have
a bed and that money has to come from somewhere and it is
a ruse, I think, really, to say that you have only cut her
off when you have deprived the family of four of one-quarter
of their income.
QUESTION:

That would also be true in the case

where the mother was cut off for refusing to allow visitation,
would it not?
MR. ELDRIDGE:
Wyman versus James?
QUESTION:

Visitation?

You are referring to

Well —
I am referring to the general problem

of which Wyman/Jantes is
MR. ELDRIDGE:

just one example.
That is a very real aspect of the

problems presented by Wyman versus James.

On the other hand,

Wyman versus James was decided by this Court before it
affirmed Townsend versus Swank and Meyers versus Juras —
not Townsend versus Swank, Doe versus Swank, Meyers versus
Juras and Carlson versus TAylor.
I think that Wyman versus James is a constitutional
case.

I don't think that it deals specifically with the

question of whether there may be a condition of eligi-jj^
outside the Social Security Act.

32
I think, in fact, Mr. Justice Blackmun said that
this was — t/as countenanced within the Social Security Act
but the NOLEO scheme does not countenance the condition of
eligibility.

There is an extensive section of the Social

Security Act, starting in 602-A(7).

It goes through Section

11 where the state is required to report a grant of
assistance to families with abandoning parents to local
law enforcement officers.
go.

That is the way it is supposed to

The report is supposed to go to the local law enforce­

ment officers.
The state is required to develop a program in
Section 17 to establish paternity and to secure support
and that is not something that we quarrel with.

We agree

with the desirability of securing support for —
QUESTION:

And NOLEO means notice to the Office

of the local enforcement —
MR. ELDRIDGE:
officers.

Notice to local law enforcement

The state is required to develop this program

but it does not say that it is required or even allowed to
establish a condition of eligibility.

It is supposed to

establish a single unit in the state responsible for
administering this program.
Section 18 says— admonishes the states to cooper­
ate with the state departments of social services — cooper­
ate with the courts and the law enforcement officials, even

33
to entering into some sort of financial arrangement with the
law enforcement officials.
Section 21 requires reporting to HEW quarterly
the name, the social security number, the last known address
of abandoning parents with outstanding orders against them
who are not paying.
It is allowed to use the social security records
to pursue these abandoning spouses or putative fathers.
Section 6010 — 610 of the Social Security Act has
IRS tracing abandoning relatives.
Section 22 under 602(A) requires cooperation with
other states in locating the parents and enforcing the order.
But throughout all of that, there is no discussion
of a condition of eligibility and from the very inception,
HEW has said that it was not a condition of eligibility.

I

refer you to the third section of my brief which deals with
that extensively.
QUESTION:

J. think —
That is a policy position of the

department.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I think it was a policy position

which was a lens to the Congressional intent.

I think they

were following what Congress had indicated because they talk
there, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms of social work, acknow­
ledging that this is a difficult time for a family when a
spouse has abandoned and they talk about the need to counsel

34
mothers with abandoned children during such a stressiul cime
in order to achieve what is best for the family.
It may not be immediately best to sue an abandoning
spouse.

The effect

of time often helps to heal these

conditions,
QUESTION:

Mr. Eldridge, would this be a conven­

ient time for you to summarize New York law with respect to
the obligation of a father to support his children whether
wed or unwed?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

A father who is acknowledged to be

the father of a child, the natural father, wed or unived,
has the obligation to support his child until 21.
QUESTION:

Whether wed or unwed.

MR. ELDRIDGE:

That is correct.

The natural

father has the obligation to support his children.
QUESTION:

Once he is identified as the father

and there is a proceeding for identifying him as the father,
i.e.

a paternity proceeding, right?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Stewart, and that proceeding may be brought by the
Commissioner of Social Services for any county.
It never was until this litigation began.
QUESTION:it is difficult to maintain that kind of
litigation without the cooperation of the mother, is jb not?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

It may be, but by and large,

35
Mr. Chief Justice, people cooperate.
We have an amicus here from Californa who ran che
figures through.

In California the Department of Social

Services, because they had not followed previous orders of
the court, are now required to tell recipients specifically
that they do not have to cooperate in this proceedings.
And yet, in California, 50 percent of all the
applicants for welfare do cooperate.
QUESTION:

We are not concerned in this case,

are we, with situations where they cooperate?

We are only

concerned in ones where they do not.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

But the point — the magnitude of

the problem — by and large, people do cooperate;in 67
percent of some counties in California, people do go along
with us.
Most people do go along with it and I submit, the
people that refuse, refuse for legitimate reasons.
If we take the main plaintiffs in this case, Jane
Doe refused to institute a paternity proceeding because she
had already instituted a paternity proceeding.

She had

instituted one in the fall of 1971 when she applied for
welfare.
In December

of 1971, the welfare department said,

you have to sue again.
She said, I already did.

36
They said, we are not going to give your daughter,
in this case, any public assistance until you sue.
They refused — they denied her public assistance
until she brought another action, notwithstanding the fact
that there was a previous action existent in the .family
court in Onondaga County.
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Eldridge, is there any

statutory amendment to which this regulation amendment of
*73 is hooked?
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

No.

There is none.

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

The federal regulation?

There is none.

That is the distinction between this

case and Dublino, I gather.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That is exactly correct.

In Dublino

in 19 —
QUESTION:

Nell, the WIN program, the 196? amend­

ment added a condition of eligibility.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
up for consideration.

In 1967 there were two amendments
One was amendments to the NOLEO

section which added four or five of the sections that I have
adverted to in the NOLEO scheme and the WIN program.
In WIN they specifically said that there shall be

37
a condition of eligibility for non-cooperation in the WIN
program.
In the NOLEO

section, they specifIcally left it

out.
QUESTION:

But they did — that was when they did

add the requirement that the states have a special unit to
pursue the support obligations of parents.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And required the states to have that

kind of a scheme.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That Is exactly right, but they did

not say that that scheme could encompass a condition of
eligibility and there had been, since 1951, a scheme which
did not include conditions of eligibility.
QUESTION:

I gather that is the reasoning of the

district court.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I believe that that is why they

granted no credence to the —
QUESTION:

Well, why they held that there was

nothing comparable to the WIN addition of a condition of
eligibility In regard to NOLEO.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That is correct and I think that

that is why Dublino is not dispositive or is really relevant
to this case.

Dub lino dea.lt with a specific allowance of a

condition of eligibility, thework rules, the WIN program.

38
QUESTION:

Well, I expect, though, we'll have to

look at both the statute and the legislative history under
the Townsend/Swank test to determine for ourselves —
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I think that is exactly the test

that should be supplied here.

The third section of my

brief indicates that.
The last brief I received from the Appellant deals
with what he calls legislative history.

It deals with a

bill that is in the House in a conference now.
I don't really think that that is fair to judge,
but that bill does specify a condition of eligibility.

It

says, in the Senate report to accompany that —
QUESTION:

Is it a pending bill now?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

This is a bill that passed the

Senate, passed the House.
QUESTION:

How long ago?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

It is HR 3153.

How long ago?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

It has been bottled up In confer­

ence since 1972.
QUESTION:

Yes, but how long ago did it pass the

House and Senate?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

It's 1973.

I’m sorry.

Did I say

1973QUESTION:

And unless it comes out today, I gather,

it will lapse, will it?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I think it is dead, really.

But it did specifically set a condition of
eligibility.

In the Senate report to accompany that, the

report says, at page 49 —
QUESTION:

Is that in your brief?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

No, this is something that was just

adverted to by my opponent in his last-brief.
QUESTION:

The reply brief?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

Yes, it is Senate Report 93 553 to

At page 49 it said —

QUESTION:

Is that report number 93?

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

553.

553-

MR. ELDRIDGE:

It says, "The committee bill would

make cooperation In Identifying the absent parent

a condition

of APDC eligibility."
They didn’t say it would reaffirm that condition
of eligibility.

They didn’t say it would make the condition

40
of eligibility clearer.

It says that they would make a

condition of eligibility.
QUESTION:

The existence of that statute doesn't

mean that the state didn’t have the power previously.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

I would submit to you —
[?]
Statements are frequently passed to

clarify ambiguous situations.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Throughout the legislative history

they do not talk about the ambiguity of the situation.

They

talked about the fact that the states are not pursuing their
remedies under the situation and they say that stronger
legislation is required.
That is exactly what they said in this report
and they say, "However, the committee feels it may be
desirable to offer a mother a financial incentive to cooper­
ate.

Now, there you have Congress talking about giving a

mother a financial incentive —
QUESTION:

Should she cooperate.

In this case,

isn’t she offered a financial incentive?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

They draw a distinction there.

say that you may keep — as the WIN program does, as the
work rules do — you may keep a greater Portion of the
support payment that you receive_
Right now, in New York, if you get a support
payment, the same amount is subtracted from your regular

They

ill
welfare balance, so people who receive support and people who
are receiving straight ADC without any support are at the
same level.

There Is no financial incentive to pursue the

support.
Congress, I think, has been very concerned through­
out the history of the NOLEO question as to the level of
effort being put in by the state.
And, again, in the Senate Report to accompany
HR 3153 at page *J0 they say, and I quote,

,!The enforcement

of child support obligations is not an area of jurisprudence
about which this country can be proud,5'

end quote.

They refer to the "thousands of unserved nonsupport warrants," and they say the blame must be shared by
judges, prosecutors and welfare officials alike.
QUESTION:

Well, is it possible that Congress is

now considering action in order to force recalcitrant states
and administrators to take steps?
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Certainly —

In other words, make it a condition of

the grant.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
consideration at 3153»

Certainly this was what was under
As you say, the 3153 is probably

dead as of Friday, when Congress adjourns.
They have been considering it and I would submit
that this is a matter for Congressional consideration.

I do

42

not think that —
QUESTION:

Isn’t it quite a different thing to

make it a condition of a grant by the Federal Government to
the state, the matching grant, and the state’s making it a
condition to the noncooperating parent?
MR. ELDRIDGE:
yes.

Those are quite different things,

One requires the state to act.

The other requires the

parent to act.
QUESTION:

So that the reason for passing the

legislation — if they do pass it — or considering it,
really doesn’t have very much relevance, it seems to me,
to what New York is doing with reference to the non­
cooperating mothers here,
MR. ELDRIDGE:
it Indicates

I think it has relevance in that

that Congress has never countenanced what

New York is doing to non-cooperating relatives.
QUESTION:

As a condition of eligibility.

MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

As a condition of eligibility.

Which under Townsend/Swank you suggest

is the test.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

Exactly the test.

And if we can’t find, either in the

Act itself or in the legislative history that they did
intend to authorize the states to attach it as a condition
of eligibility, T own sen d/Swank says the states can’t do it.

43
MR. ELDRIDGE:
Brennan.

That is correct, Mr. Justice

It starts in Kate versus Smith, it goes In Townsend

Swank and it is reaffirmed in Carleson versus Re rail lard,
all of which xvere unanimous opinions of this Court.
QUESTION:

And if the dockets are told that it

Isn't forbidden and it is a reasonable regulation, it is
permissible, is it not?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Well, under Dublino, there was

discussion of what a reasonable regulation might be.

They

said if there was a conflict of substance — it is footnote
34, I believe, In Dub lino — that there x^as a conflict of
substance between the Social Security Act and the adminis­
trative regulation, then, obviously, the Supremacy Clause
operated and the federal statute was supreme and the adminis­
trative regulation could not exist.
I think any time you have a condition of eligi­
bility, that is a substantial conflict — a condition of
eligibility not set forth as need and dependency or within
the legislative history of the Social Security Act and that
is what we have in this case.
I would say that this is outside the legitimate
sphere of administration.

This goes beyond.

This gets to

the heart of who can get AFDC.
QUESTION:

Well, then, if Congress passes this

pending legislation that you have been talking about there

probably would be a question raised by someone at some time
whether it is permissible for Congress to attach a condition
to its grant of $353 million annually to the State of New
York that they pursue.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

But that has been the nature of

categorical grants from the inception.

Perhaps revenue"

sharing has changed the approach.
QUESTION:

But if it is reasonable, then there —

perhaps there is no constitutional question.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

That may be, but —

But I thought you had virtually

conceded its reasonableness In terms of —
MR. ELDRIDGE:

The reasonableness of what?

I am

sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Of the categorical grant by the Federal

Government to the state.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

There are lots of ways to examine

the reasonableness.
In the instance of federal revenue-sharing at
this point, they aren't as reasonable as the categorical
grants because there is less money in them for the states.
I really am not supporting that at this point in
this case.

I think vrhat we really have to" talk to is the

statutory conflict here.
Congress has been very upset, as I was saying,

45
about the states* efforts in this area.
They say — in the Senate Report to accompany HR 1,
which is 92-1230 —
QUESTION:

What relevance is HR 1 and this Senate

Report?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Well, it is really not good legisla­

tive history because it is not legislation that is ultimately
passed but they were upset, there again, about the failure
of the states to pursue support.
The latest GAO survey indicated that 72 percent of
people who had support orders against them entered by a
court or who had agreed to pay support, 72 percent of those
parents were not in substantial compliance with the orders.
I submit to you that that is the problem.

The

problem is —
QUESTION:

Part of It is that you can't get blood

out of a turnip, isn’t it?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

I tried to say that In family

court, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and the response I have is that
"I do not see a turnip standing here In front of me,
Mr. Eldridge.

I see a man and he is capable of going to

work.11
Well, certainly It Is true.

In many cases, poor

people don’t have any money or they don’t have enough money
to pay a support payment.

46
All right.

Thera are people who do have an

ability to pay and certainly they should be pursued and made
to pay their statutory obligation.

I think that it may•

even go beyond a statutory obligation.
The reason that the state — that it is so anxious,
and we have heard here from California, Iowa, as well as
Nextf York.

There were 19 other states.

One of the Justices

asked the question, how many states had rules like this?
There had been 19 other states who had rules that
were knocked down.

I think the rest of the states are

waiting for your action today to determine whether they are
going to continue to enforce the rules.
QUESTION:

Do you think the remainder of the states

do have such rules?
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

I am sure that not all of them do.

But most —

MR. ELDRIDGE:

I don’t know.

It has been a very

prevalent practice of late.
QUESTION:

And 19 of them so far have been invali­

dated, of 19 separate states.
MR. ELDRIDGE:
QUESTION:

In —

MR. ELDRIDGE:
in several states.

Of 19 separate states.

There have been several regulations

In New York, for Instance, in 1969,

there was a regulation that was withdrawn.

47
QUESTION:

When you say invalidated — by a three-

judge court?
MR. ELDRIDGE:

Yes, they were all three-judge courts

with the exception of one that — Judge Gerfein in the
Southern District threw out because he was going to do it on
the statutory basis and he felt no need to convene three
judges.
QUESTION:

Mr. Eldridge?

MR. ELDRIDGE:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

QUESTION:

The memorandum filed by the

Solicitor General on page 4 states that the — that HEW
has advised us that 10 states, which include Iowa and New
York, containing more that one-third of the AFDC recipients
require such parental cooperation as a condition to their
eligibility.
MR. ELDRIDGE:

That must be accurate for that time,

but over the past — since 1969 when Doe y. Shapiro was
brought, there have been 19 states that have had their
regulations thrown out by federal district courts; three
states having their regulations thrown out by this Court
and I submit that they were all the same essential regulation.
They required an illegal condition of eligibility for APDC.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Eldridge.

I think you have used your time — no, you have

about one minute left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP
ALAN W. RUBENSTEIN, ESQ.
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

I’ll just say, your Honor, that

last Saturday’s press carried an item that the Committee
on Finance had approved a new bill on this subject of HR 3153
which had been in conference.
I don’t know where it is going.

I haven’t had

time to check it but I give that to the Court.
I call the Court’s attention to Wyman against
James and Charleston against Wohlgemuth, where
approved

the Court

situations where the grant to the entire family

was cut off for failure to give a lien or

cooperate.

Giving a grant to the mother in 1950 was intended
to accomplish an equitable result.

There is no question

about that and that is when she was included.
QUESTION:

If this new bill passes —

MR. RUBENSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, sir?

If this new bill passes — and at least

on the face of it, that would make New York’s regulation
valid, have these mothers

been paid up to date because

they won below?
MR. RUBENSTEIN:

Oh, as far as I know.

no reason to believe they haven’t.

There is

We have been under a

stay — oh, the intervenor — counsel will have to tell you
