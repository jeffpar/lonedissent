MORNING SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

10:08 a.m.

We'll resume the

arguments in Ivan Allen Company against the United States.
Mr. Crampton, you have 18 minutes remaining.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to point out in continuing our argument
that if the resources of this corporation had been entirely
reflected in plant and equipment, then there would obviously
be no liability here for the unreasonable accumulation and
I think counsel for the Taxpayer has agreed In his oral
argument that the money that they invested In the Xerox
stock is, in fact, extra money that the corporation really
didn't need, other than, perhaps, the $100,000 in costs.
QUESTION:

I suppose included in the first part of

youx’ statement would, be the land, for example, that was
purchased for possible plant expansion, if they could
demonstrate the valid basis.
MR. CRAMPTON:

That Is right.

Yes.

I think

anything, If they can really firm it down, that they
planned to move the plant or expand it or do something
l-dce that, if they have a solid, reasonably-■anticipated need,
that would qualify under the exemption.
QUESTION:

If it was land they bought for

speculation, for a rise in the market, then would it fall in

36
the same category, in your view, as the Xerox stock?
MR. CRAMPTON:
liquid

asset.

No, because it would not be a net

It wouldn’t be readily realizable.

I think

they do make a distinction •— you have to look at what your
current situation is and if you had it tied up in long-term
investments like that, I don't believe any of the cases say
that you would consider that.
Now, perhaps —
QUESTION:

It turns on liquidity, then.

MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes.

I assume if they kept

investing, say, hundreds of thousands of dollars in land
just to, perhaps with the thought of avoiding this, why,
maybe the Commissioner might step in but basically they
have been looking at liquid assets.
QUESTION:

Although neither the statute nor the

regulations say anything about liquid assets.
MR. CRAMPTON:

No but I think the case law has

pretty well developed that and that is the — the theory, I
think, back of it is that if you have the money invested in
such a way that you really can't get your hands on it, then
nobody could criticize you for not paying the dividends that
otherwise would be due.
QUESTION:

Well, and yet the whole — if the whole

fulcrum of decision were vjhether or not the assets were
liquid, it seems to me that that would perhaps provide a

37
good many opportunities to violate the —- both the letter
and the spirit of section 532, if corporations could go off
and buy Rembrandt protraits and things like that, that would
be, certainly, an incorporated pocketbook, wouldn't it?
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think so and that was why I

qualified my answer to the Chief Justice that I thought if
this became obvious, the Commissioner might very well move
in.

You shouldn't just let them, as you say, buy portraits

or buy land that they don't anticipate ever using at all
but I think, as a —
QUESTION:

Maybe — is there any decision of this

Court that says that the test is whether the assets are
liquid?

Or easily convertible into cash?
MR, CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

The National Grocery —

There is nothing in either the statute

or the regulations that says a word about that.
MR. CRAMPTON:
Grocery Company

You are right.

But the National

case that we mentioned earlier focussed on

the liquidity of the assets, pointing out that the securities
that were really liquid had dropped in value —
QUESTION:

Had depreciated —

MR. CRAMPTON;
QUESTION:

— unrealized depreciation —

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

— $2 million.

Yes.
and the Court in that case said that

38
was a factor to be taken into consideration.
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

And that is about all it said, isn’t It?

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That is right, yes.

But in

any event, in this case, the

assets are liquid.
MR. CRAMPTON:

That has been stipulated and they

are, everybody knows Xerox stock is liquid and that is the
principal asset that they had here.
QUESTION:

Well, how about the old French saying

that everything has its price?

You know, you can take

something that doesn’t have —■ isn’t traded on a market and
yet, presumably, if you wanted to sell it, you can sell it
and If somebody wants to buy it, they can buy it.
It is Just a question of getting together on the
price.
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think that Is true, but I think

part of the answer to this problem of putting your securities
or your assets in long-term Investments are that probably the
board of directors, as a practical matter, would not want to
do that because most corporations closely-held, they
probably want to have their assets where they can reach
them or readily convert them If they need to.
QUESTION:

Unless It is an Incorporated pocketbook.

MR. CRAMPTON:

That is right.

But even, I think a

39
lot of people with incorporated pocketbooks may not want to
put their money into land that they feel they couldn't get
it out for 15 or 20

years at anywhere they had put it in

but I do — coming back to this case, I think we have stipu­
lated that question out of the case and stipulated that we
do have liquid assets here and as I say, we can, this
corporation could realize, could convert this if it needed
to or borrow against it or utilize the assets to pay the
dividends.
QUESTION:

That is fine if liquidity is an

important aspect of the test.
HR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Well, I think it is.

So, I gather —

MR. CRAMPTON:

I mean, that is what the cases — the

lower courts that have considered this have upheld that,
time and time again.
QUESTION:

It is a rather limiting te3t, isn't it,

when you consider that in certain periods, land, investment
in land could be a shelter that could be quite as liquid
as Xerox stock with a very high return in certain areas of
the country, capital gains.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Well, that is true but I don't think

that your land — your problems with land usually — I
ifould say, as a practical matter are much more complicated
than they are with the securities on the New York Stock

40

exchange.
So often, even though you think you have got a
great bargain in land, you may have title problems or
questions of state regulations, zoning and things like that
which complicate your life if you are putting your assets
into land but you certainly do not have those with listed
securities.
Mow, coming back to that National Grocery
QUESTION:

In other words — pardon me, if

■—
I

interrupt you again, are you really saying that the liquidity
test is something like making a comparison of itfhether the
asset is

In about the same shape as it would be If it

were sitting in the bank?
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

In the bank It would clearly be —

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Readily available.

— subject to this penalty.

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

If it is —

And you are saying that any asset which

has essentially the same kind of liquidity as money In the
bank is then subject to penalty provisions.
MR. CRAMPTON:

It is subject to being considered

In determining whether or not the reasonable needs of the
business can be met from the available resources.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crampton, alluding to our discussion

41
yesterday and having In mind the question by the Chief Jus­
tice as to stock being equivalent in terras of liquidity with
cash, what would you advise a corporation?

What v/ould you

have advised this corporation, bearing in mind, as I noted
yesterday, that Xerox

stock varied, according to one of

the manuals, from 35 to 134 last year, xvhat would you have
advised this company, at the beginning of the year on your
theory of the law as to when to sell the stock or whether to
sell it and would you have advised the client that Xerox
stock, aft 134, was the equivalent of cash when it dropped to
35 before the year was over?
UR. CRAMPTONj

No, I would — to answer your

question, I think I would have suggested that the corpora­
tion look at that movement of the Xerox stock during the
year anci i* tney had bought it — 1 forget what the pries
was per share but in your example, supposing they had
bought iu at 5 and it never got below 35 and they had this
type of earnings and they had this volume of shares so
that they had a — if you used the value of 35, they were
maybe two or three times above their earnings — I would
certainly suggest that either they declare their earnings
as a dividend or do so realising that they would risk a
tax under the penalty provision here of accumulated earnings
tax.
QUESTION:

You would do that at the first of the

H2
year?
MR. CRAMPTON:
at the end of the year.

No, I think you would look at that
You would see where the movement has

been during the year and I think that your bottom would be,
the lowest thing would be the factor that you would really
consider if you wanted to be safe.
QUESTION:

So on the last day of your fiscal year,

you would take a look at the market value of the stock.

I

think you said yesterday that you thought you could average
it or take the low figure.

What would you do with your

real estate that we talked about yesterday?

Would you get

appraisals of it —
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

No.

— at various times during the year?

MR. CRAMPTON:

No, because I don’t think the cases

say you take into consideration real estate, unless, in the
example you gave me, you could establish that it was readily
marketable.
But here again, I think you look at what the assets
are that are available for — to pay the dividends.

Can

you pay the dividends without disrupting the normal life of
this corporation in a serious way and if you have liquid
assets, the question is, why shouldn’t the dividends be
paid?
I would like to, if I might, just mention briefly

43
the one statement from that Notional Grocery case that I
think does state the position of this Court on the question.
It said, "Depreciation in any of the assets is
evidence to be considered in determining the issue of fact,
whether the accumulation of profits was in excess of the
reasonable needs of the business."
And as near as I know, that quoted statement has
never been questioned or repudiated and if you do look at
the depreciation in the assets, then it seems to us that if
the economic test applies when the assets are going down,
that you are certainly justified in looking at it when they
go up.
The stipulation we have mentioned shows that this
Xerox stock had. a cost of $102,000 for the fiscal year ’66
and it had a fair

market value, as the parties stipulated,

of almost $2 million and a half so that that is 20 or 25
times the original cost.
The margin here is such that this corporation
could certainly have paid a dividend of $344,000 that year
without any substantial loss of economic muscle as we view
the situation.
I was asked yesterday —
QUESTION:

It would have had — in order to do

that, It would have had either to sell part of the stock
or borrow against it, wouldn’t it?

44
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

If we are talking about liquidity.

MR, CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

That is right.

If we are talking about cash dividends.

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

It mJ.ght have5 yes.

Well —

They could use it to pay out dividends

in kind, too, could they not?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes, they could, but to pay out —

if they paid out the Xerox stock, it would have come out at
their cost and the taxpayers would have picked It up at
market value and I think that that would have been a —
they wouldn't do that as a practical matter, I don't think.
QUESTION:

Although they did do it in a previous

year.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes, as to a few shares, 870, I

think.
I was asked yesterday about the considerations for
accounting — pardon me.
QUESTION:
to do?

Well, why would that be disadvantageous

If the corporation paid it out in kind and under

their regulations it is at cost, it at least would not have
been a realizable or taxable gain.

They would just have paid

j-i out au cost and then the shareholders would have received
io at fair market value with fair market value as the share­
holders' basis in the event of subsequent sale.

Why would

45
that have been disadvantageous economically?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Well, I believe the corporations

would have had to pay a tax on receipt of dividends at fair
market value when they received the
QUESTION:

The —?

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

At fair market value.

As ordinary income.

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

The shareholders, pardon me.

At fall* —

MR, CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

shares.

Yes.

But that would be true cf cash, too.

MR. CRAMPTON:

That is right.

But If they

distributed the stock they would be picking up — they'd
get $100,000 credit and pick up $2.5 million of ordinary
[that]
Income,whereas I don't think that if the stockholders/are
using this corporation are concerned about it, they would
not probably want to pick up that kind of Income in any one
year.
QUESTION:

But if they paid out a million dollars

in Xerox stock to the stockholders as dividends, to the
stockholders of their own company, they would save a fairly
substantial amount in commissions, would they not?
In broker^ fees.
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think on a block that big, the

commission would be maybe one or two percent.

We have

ii 6

stipulated here, X think, a 6 percent commission rate, but
that was being liberal.
QUESTION:

That is

MR. CRAMPTON:

unrealistically high, I think.

Yes, we thought so.

I mean, I think

so, on a block of that sisse.

If I could touch just briefly on this question
of the Securities Exchange Commission situation, it seems
to us that any financial statement that might be submitted
to the Securities arid Exchange Commission or for accounting
purposes are usually designed to reflect a financial
condition for a fixed period.
They do not usually look at the external sources
for supplemental information 3uch as valuations and the
question here is whether the corporation is in a position
to distribute these current earnings as dividends.
If the corporation contends that it has business
needs, then, as we have mentioned, we look at the available
resources and this requires a measuring of assets during
the period.
Their

actual costs some years earlier is really,

we think — we believe — irrelevant to this economic
examination of the period in time and I think the correct­
ness of this position is demonstrated by the fact that you
U3e value if it is less than cost in determining total
resources, as this Court has done in the National Grocery

case.
If the cost were, In fact, the test, you might
find a situation where the Taxpayer had assets on his books
considerably higher than their existing value at the time
and they really didn’t have them.
In summary, it seems to us that the statute
requires the consideration of economic needs of the business.
If the corporation has net liquid assets substan­
tially in excess of economic needs, it should distribute
its earnings or pay the tax.
It certainly should not be permitted to avoid the
tax by simply investing funds in readily marketable
securities.
We believe that the decision of the Fifth Circuit
was correct and should be affirmed.
