MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER s

We »11 hear arguments next

in 74-364, United States against Hale,
Mr, Frey, you may proceed whenever you’re ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on the government's petition for
v/rit of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, which reversed respondent’s
robbery conviction.
Government’s evidence against respondent Hale at the
trial in this case consisted of four principal matters:
First, there was the eye-witness identification by
the victim, Mr. Arrington;
Second, there was the fact that Mr. Arrington had told
the police, prior to the time Mr. Hale was arrested, that one
of the robbers might be named Billy Hale;
Third was the fact of Hale's attempted flight, when
a police officer sought to arrest him after Arrington had
identified Hale on the street as one of the robbers;
Fourth was N ile's possession in his trousers’ pocket
of $123 .in cash at the time of his arrest.
It's on the latter piece of evidence that this case

4

focuses , and that much of the trial focuses 0
Arrington testified that the robbers took an
estimated $96 from him, that it was taken by co-defendant
Anderson, and that he sat? it handed by Anderson to respondent
Hale.
One of the arresting officers testified to finding
and seizing the money at the time of Hale’s arrest.
It was also brought out that Hale was unemployed.
The defense also concentrated on the money found in
respondent's possession after the robbery.

Six of its seven

witnesses testified on that subject.
The defense explanation was that respondent's
estranged wife had received her welfare check that morning,
cashed it* and given $150 to respondent for the purpose of
purchasing certain money orders.

She had written a list on

a scrap of paper of the money orders to be purchased, which,
respondent testified, he threv? away the day after his arrest.
At the time of his arrest, three or four hours
after he had received the money from his wife, respondent
testified that he was on his way to buy the money orders
which she had requested.
The closing arguments of counsel also devoted
significant attention to the question of the money.
Now, th© particular questioning that led to the
reversal of respondent's conviction came during cross-examina-

5

felon of him by the prosecutoro
The prosecutor asked him — and this is at page 4 of
til© Appendix — "Did they find some money on you?
wYes,

they did#

"Did you in any way indicate where that money came
from?
"No, I didn't.
"Why not?
"I didn't feel that it was necessary at the time.
"You were advised of your rights, were you not?
"Yes."
At that point the court interjected, stated that?
"H© is not required to indicate where the money came from.
There is no responsibility on his part in regard to that."
And then in response to objections by defense counsel,
the court further stated, "I indicated to the jury that it is
clearly an inappropriate question.
ladies and gentlemen.

You may disregard it,

The defendant is not required to give

any explanation whatsoever at the time of his arrest.1
The Court of Appeals found this questioning to be
iiuproper and reversed the conviction because of it.
Now, in analyzing this case, there are two distinct
questions which I think it's important to keep separate.
The first is whether respondent's silence at the time
he was arrested was so lacking in probative value that its

6
disclosure to the jury was more likely to impede than to
foster a factually accurate verdict by the jury»
QUESTION: Did the district judge give that admonition
to the juri' without ~~ on his own, without any request on the
part of the defendant?
MR. FREY:

Well, he initially interrupted the

questioning without any objection by defense counsel to
indicate that it was an improper question. There then was a
request that the question and answer be stricken, and he
responded by telling the jury that they may disregard it.
I’m not sure what that -- how the jury took that.
But there was a harmless error contention raised
in the Court of Appeals, and it was rejected, and we have
not petitioned on the question of whether the error, if there
was one, was harmless in this case.
Now, the second question, apart from the probative
vlu© prejudicial effect, question, is whether even if the
disclosure of respondent’s silence was likely to contribute
to an accurate verdict, there is some overriding constitu­
tional policy dictating that a preference be accorded to
suppression of the evidence, even at the expense of the
truth-seeking function of the trial.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I have trouble with the

MR. FREY:

That’s correct* There's no question

7
about that.
QUESTION:

And this money was not

counterfeit, was

it?
MR. PREY:

No.

QUESTION:

It wasn't contraband, was it?

MR. PREY:

No.

QUESTION:

Well, why should he — I mean, they took

out his keys? he didn't say anything about those either, did
he?
MR. PREY:
QUESTION:

Well —
Why should he — why did he have the

obligation of opening his mouth about —
MR, PREY?

We don't in any way suggest that he had

any obligation to give any explanation. The question here is
whether it was sufficiently likely that a person in his
circumstances would have volunteered an explanation, would have
chosen to explain?that his failure to do so sheds soma light
on the truthfulness of his testimony at trial,
QUESTIONi

That the fact that he had money in his

pocket, he was obliged to explain it?
MR. FREY:

He was not obliged to explain it to the

police, he was not obliged to explain it at trial.

He elected

not to explain it —•
QUESTION:
MR. FREY:

Well, why was he asked the question?
He was asked the question because his

failure to explain it, even though he was not obliged to
explain it, was nevertheless probative, and I think !’m —
QUESTION: Well, was it probative that he had a watch
on, and didn't explain that?
Was it probative that he —
MR. FREY:

Well, it would have been -~

QUESTIONs

— if he had a pack of cigarettes and

he didn't explain that?
MR. FREY:

No? the reason the money was probative

and was considered to be probative, and this is why I indicated
the amount of attention that was paid to it, was that it was
presumably, under the circumstances, unusual for somebody in
Hale's condition to have such a large sum of money on him.
QUESTION:
MR. FREY:

What condition?
Well, he was unemployed.

QUESTION: Did they know that?
him, and he didn't say.
MR. FREY:

I thought they asked

How did they know it?

He didn't say, but his wife testified

on cross-examination that he was unemployed.
QUESTION:

I'm talking about when the question was

askedj they hadn't talked to his wife.
MR. FREY:

Well, I'm not sure that I understand --

QUESTION:

You say — we're talking about, to use

your words, the condition he was in when he was arrested.
Ha was a person, walking down the street, with money in his

9
pocket.
MR. PREY:

That’s right.

It was an unusually large

su7ti of money in his pocket.
QUESTION:

A hundred and twenty-three dollars, in

this day and age, is a large sum of money?
[Laughter. ]
MR. FREY:

Wall, I think it was unusually large

under these circumstances.
QUESTION:

He could get a steak with it!

Hunh?
MR. FREY:

Well, —

Why was it ~ is it a large sum of

money or not?

circumstances, this —

MR. FREY:

Well, what were his circumstances?
The circumstances were that h© was

slightly lesser, sum of money had been stolen from the victim?

QUESTION:

But they didn’t know he was unemployed

at that time.
MR. FREY: But that’s not the question, it’s not
whether the police knew at that time —
QUESTION:

You assumed — you assumed he was unem-

10
ployed.

Why?
MR, FREY;

Well, the question is not what the police

knew, Mr, Justice Marshall, the question is what the jury 'would
know in evaluating the truthfulness of Hale's testimony at
trial, of his explanation, and I think it’s —
QUESTION:

And they had just told him that he had a

right to be silent,
MR, FREY:

Yes, they had,

QUESTION: And he was silent,
MR. FREY:

Yes, he was.

QUESTION:

And so he's penalized for that.

MR, FREY?

Well, no, I don’t think he’s penalised

for it, I think that there is a consequence that attached,

why had had the money, he —

QUESTION:

But he asked the witness, he said:

'‘But

you were given the warnings, weren't you?”
MR. PREY:

Well, I think that the reason that

question was asked, I think it's appropriate to call to the
jury's attention, as Judge Gesell did here, that there is no
duty to answer questions, and the reason it’s appropriate is
that that's a factor that the jury ought to take into considera­
tion in evaluating whether or not the defendant’s testimony has
been impeached, whether they believe the defendant's testimony.
It is a factor in the defendant’s favor that he
didn't have a duty to speak and that he was so advisQd.

In

terms of ~
QUESTION:

I feel it's the fact that money was stolen

rather than a watch or a package of cigarettes that makes a
question about money relevant, whereas a question about a watch
or cigarettes might not have been.
MR. FREY;

That's correct. And the money was, after

all, at trial, one of the principal pieces of evidence against
Hale.

When Hale chose to testify, one of the burdens that he

obviously undertook was to explain how it came about that he
had this sum of money on him in order to rebut the inference
that the jury might otherwise draw from his possession of this
money.
When he sought to do that, the question then arose

12
whether we could seek to impeach his testimony by shewing his
silence before the police,,
Mow, the Court of Appeals -QUESTIONS

That was not ~ as I remember the record,

they asked him, "Were you searched at the time you were
picked up?"

And he said no.
i

"When were you?"
*

•

He said, "When I got to the
i

precinct."
"When you got to the precinct, what happened?"
"They searched me."
That was during that part of his testimony, it
wasn't the part about the $45 in one-dollar bills, you know.
MR. PREY:

Well, this was cross-examination by

the prosecutor.
QUESTION x
MR. FREY:

That * s right.
Ha had — his testimony — on cross-

examination the prosecutor asked him whether they found money.
Because one of the theorizes of the prosecution, one of the
factual theories that was submitted to the jury was that this
was the money that was stolen -QUESTION:

But that was already in evidence from

the policeman, wasn't it?
MR. PREY:

Well, I understand that the factor of

his possession of the money was already in evidence, but
what was also in evidence at the point that this cross-axaraina-

13
tion took place as his explanation of how he came to have the
money 0
Now, the Court of Appeals said there was nothing
inconsistent, as I think you're suggesting, between his silence
at the police station and his explanation at trial.
agree with that»

We don't

We think it's important to inquire into what

is meant by the word "inconsistent"»
The Court of Appeals and respondent here use it to
mean necessarily contradictory.

That is, that the testimony

and the prior inconsistency can’t both be true, and they
seek to distinguish cases like Harris and Waldsr on the grounds
that there there was that kind of inconsistency.
Now, the question is, in order to be probative for
impeachment purposes, must evidence be wholly and inevitably
inconsistent, or does it suffice if it's probably inconsistent?
If it tends to impeach the witness’s testimony.
Now, we think that the latter is sufficient.

And in

this connection I refer the Court to the definition of "relevant
evidence" which is contained in Rule 401 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence.
"Relevant evidence" is there defined as evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of
consequence to the determination of the action more probable
or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
Applying that standard here, it's clear that respon~

14
dent's prior silence should have been admitted, that, having
at least some tendency to show that his testimony at trial
was not truthful.
In this connection, I'd like to advert to what Mr,
Justice Frankfurter said in his concurring opinion in Adamson
Vo California about this matter.

He saids

"Sensible and just-minded men, in important affairs
of life, deem it significant that a man remains silent
when confronted with serious and responsible evidence
against himself which it is within his power to contra­
dict,

The notion that to allow jurors to do that which

sensible and rightminded men do every day violates the
'immutable principles of justice' as conceived by a
civilized society is to trivialize the importance of
'due process', ,,, To deny that the jury can be
trusted to make such discrimination, that is, assess
the reasons for silence, is to show little confidence in
the jury system,"
This is an empirical question.

And the degree to

which silence tends to impeach a subsequently proffered
explanation will vary from case to case.
Here its impeaching effect is high.

If Hale's

testimony at trial was true, it seems to us, and v/e think it
would have seemed to the jury, extremely unlikely that he would
have failed to tell the same story to the police.

15
By telling the story, by explaining to the police
what happened at the time, he would have capitalized on an
opportunity possibly to prevent prosecution altogether, or,
at the very least, to netxtraliz© a damaging piece of evidence.
This opportunity was evanescent.

If he didn’t tell

the polica at that time where this money came from, he could
never afterwards convince the ^police that his subsequent
explanation was not fabricated.
QUESTION: Did he make any effort to show, after this
episode, did he make any effort to show, through his wife,
precisely where she had gotten the cash?
MR. FREY:

Yes, that was shown in great detail.

There was evidence showing that she received the check.

They

had someone from the welfare office testify as to whan the
check was sent out, someone from the Treasury Department
testified about when the check was cashed.

It was clear that

she had received the money that day, and then of course there
was her word and Hale’s that she had given the money to him.
Now, finally, a point that I think is very significant
in assessing whether his silence was probative, whether it
would have meant anything to a rational jury, is the fact
that it seems to me most unlikely that somebody in Hale’s
situation would have sat quietly by, let the police take from
him the money which belonged to his wife, which was her
welfare check, which was all the money that she and their two

16

children had to live on for the next month, and would simply
have said absolutely nothing»
Of course he had a right to say nothing, but that's
not the issue? the issue is whether it was likely under those
circumstances that he would have said nothing»

If it was

unlikely under those circumstances that he would have said
nothing, then surely it bears substantially on the veracity
of his testimony to let the jury know,
QUESTION? Are you telling us that if he had said,
"That was my wife's money", they would have given it back to
him and turned him loose?
MR, FREY;

Well, I'm not sure what the police •—

QUESTION?

You don't really mean that.

He was

already being booked.
MR. FREY:

Well, I'm not saying that they would

have given him —
QUESTION:

He was even being searched.

Am I right?

Wasn't he being booked?
MR. FREY:

I think he was —• I’m not clear whether

he was being booked at the time he was searched? but I think
it’s probably true to say that they would not have given him
back the money without checking it out.
But, on the other hand, they would have checked the
story out before he had a chance to speak with his wife, before
he had a chance to fabricate a story.

17

After all, the contention of the government at trial
and the purpose of the impeachment was that this was a story
that he fabricated for purposes of trial.
We were trying to show that he didn’t have a story.
He had no explanation at the time he was in the station house,
and that’s why he was silent.

And we think that, of course he

could explain to the jury, that’s another important point, Mr.
Justice Marshall? he could explain to the jury why he was
silent.

The jury could see him.

If they believed his

explanation that his silence wa3 not because the story was
►

fabricated, but because he was relying on his rights as he
understood them, because he was intimidated, for whatever
reason, then the jury would discount the impeaching effect of
that cross-examination.
QUESTION:

In point of fact, he was asked to

explain his possession of the money *—
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

He was.

According to the colloquy -~

-- at the time that he was searched,

wasn’t he?
MR. FREY:

— between counsel and the court, of

course this inquiry into his silence was cut off —
QUESTION: And so the jury never knew that he was
asked?
MR. FREY: The jury never knew that he was asked, that
is correct

13
QUESTION:
MR* FREY:

Unh-hunh.
I mean, I picture further cross-examina­

tion would have gone into the kind of things, such as:

"Could

you stand there quietly and let them take your wif'es welfare
money?"

And then he might say, "Well, I knew I wouldn’t get

it back anyway."

And then the jury could see whether they

believed him* when he gave the explanation.
Now, it’s instructive here to compare the Grunewald
case on which the Court of Appeals relied.

What this Court

did in Grunewald was it looked at the answers that Mr.
Grunewald gave at trial, at the testimony —- or, rather,
Halperin, the defendant who was involved in that aspect of
the case.
They looked at the answers and they said:

Indeed,

these answers could have been incriminating if they had
been given to the grand jury.

Iherefore, under the other

circumstances which we've adverted to in our brief, we think
it has no probative value in the special circumstances of
this case, that he invoked the Fifth Amendrae-t before the
grand jury.
But let's look here at what it is that Mr. Hale
said.

A completely exculpatory statement. A statement which,

if true, couldn't possibly have gotten him into trouble.

If

true.
Now, also in terms of prejudicial effect, there is

19

a distinction between this case and Grunewald. Grunewald in­
volved the balancing, as is traditionally the function of the
trial court, between the probative value and any potential
prejudicial effects.
In Grunewald, in light of the conditions at the time
with regard to the Fifth Amendment, and this was in the height
of the McCarthy era, the Court felt that to tell the jury that
te witness had taken the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury
was to introduce a substantial risk of prejudice that the jury
would impermissibly conclude from that that he must have been
guilty.
Here, the jury was not told, this line of questioning
did not suggest any claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incriminationy this line of questioning did not
even indicate v/hether he was otherwise silent before the
police.
It was sharply focused on a particular inquiry by the
police, and on a particular

piece of his testimony, to wit,

his explanation of the money.
Under these circumstances, there was very, very little
hazard of prejudicial effect.
Now, I've deferred discussion of the Fifth Amendment
issue, both because they have been considered at greater length
in our brief and because I don't believe that, properly analyzed,
this is really a Fifth Amendment case.

20

The Court of Appeals based its holding on Griffin,
and on Miranda? but neither of ftiose cases, we submit, supports
the results that it reached.
Griffin is critically different because it involved
a non-testifying defendant.

Thus, it was not concerned, as

here, with specific impeachment use of silence.

The whole

truth policy of the Harris line of cases was not implicated,
nor was the waiver concept of Raffel implicated in the Griffin
situation.
Moreover, in this case, unlike Griffin, respondent
had the opportunity to explain his silence? the non-testifying
defendant at the criminal trial has no such opportunity.
Also, I think it's a. little clearer that Griffin’s
refusal to take the stand was an invocation of his Fifth
Amendment privilege, in the sense that Hale's silence was not.
Now, the Miranda dictum, I submit, was also not
intended to apply to impeachment use of silence.

Rather, it

was a reference to use in the case in chief.
In summary, we think that this case fits within the
Raffel-Harris line of cases, in which this Court has rejected
Fifth Amendment claims of a testifying defendant, emphasizing
the importance of fully testing the truthfulness of a
defendant's testimony, of getting the whole truth, rather than
the defendant’s tailored version of it.
It's recognized in those cases that the protection

21
of the Fifth Amendment are intended for the benefit of those
who do not wish to testify and not for the benefit of those who,
as Hale, do wish to testify0
One final note I'd like to makes

A ruling in favor

of the government's position in this case will not have any
effect of encouraging police misconduct in interrogating
arrested suspects#

We can compare this case with the arguments

that were mads in the recently decided case of Oregon v, Hass,
where the dissent took the position that there would not be
any impediment to the police, once a request for counsel had
been made, to persist in their questioning, since they had
everything to gain and nothing to lose,,
The Court nevertheless felt that the "whole truth"
policy of the Harris line of cases was of overriding importance
there.
Here, however, we have a situation in which the police,,
far from being given an incentive to coerce the statement,
are given a situation in which, even if the defendant remains
silent, there may be some prosecutive benefit down the road
from such a chain of events.
So that, to the extent that there is any tendency
here to affect police conduct, the tendency will be to enforce
the duty or reinforce the duty of the police to give the
arrested suspect a free choice between voluntarily remaining
silent and voluntarily speaking.

22

Mr. Hale had that choice,»
7

Finally, I’d like to mention to the Court the
Barnes case, which it decided two terms ago, in 412 U.S» at
846, we didn't include that in our brief, but I think there
are some parallels.
That case involved the question of the inference
that could b® drawn from possession of recently stolen goods
«•“ unexplained possession of recently stolen goods.
There was a Fifth Amendment contention that this
put pressure on a defendant to proffer an explanation of
his possession, since otherwise the jury would be told that
they could infer his guilt from unexplained possession, and
the Court rejected that contention.
Also I'd like to point out that at page 31 of
respondent's brief, they rely on a case called Miranti, and
that case haB been limited to its facts by a subsequent
?
Second Circuit decision in United States v. Sewald, 450 F.2d
1129.
I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time for -•»
QUESTION:
down, Mr. Frey:

May I just ask you, before you sit

What if the trial judge had not told the

jury what h® did in this case, i„e„, what if he had not told
them that the defendant was not required to give any explana­
tion whatever at the time of his arrest?
MR. FREY:

Well, we think that

well, there are two

23
pieces.

We think, of course, that he was completely wrong in

saying that it x^as an improper question,
I don't think that we would object to the Court
reminding the jury, although the defendant has the opportunity
to so testify, that there is no duty on the part of the
defendant to speak.
I think the jury ought to understand, in the context
of evaluating a defendant’s silence, that he has been given
Miranda warnings.
It would be appropriate for the defendant to explain
that, if that’s his explanation for his silence, for his counsel
to bring it out on redirect, or even for the Court to instruct,
I don’t think we have any objection to that.
What we want is for the jury to know what we consider
to be a very salient fact, in evaluating the truthfulness of
his testimony,

made, but much of the authority on which we rely would be
inapplicable to such an argument,

QUESTION?

—• you’re really using it as substantive

evidence of his guilt.
MR. FREY:

No.

No.

Here it’s clearly —

QUESTION:

Well, you're using it to cast in doubt

the content, the truthfulness of his explanation.
MR. FREY:

Of a particular part of his explanation.

This is an important distinction that I think that respondent
fails to understand in discussing the

Stewart case.

There's

a difference between general impeachment, impeachment of his
character, impeachment of his general credibility? and a
specific impeachment, directed at specific testimony.
QUESTION:

But you're saying to the jury — in

effect saying to the jury:

"If his explanation were really

true, he would have said something about it”?
MR. FREY:

That's what we're saying —

QUESTION:

So you're saying his explanation is not

true?
MR. FREY;

That's what

— thsb's right.

Now,

that's an impeachment use as I understand the concept.
QUESTION:

Well, I —

MR. FREY:

In any event, we certainly contend that

that's a legitimate use of that evidence, however it should be
labeled.
QUESTION:

You have not made a point, if I recall

your brief, of the fact that no objection was made by the

26

defense here.
MR. FREYs

Well, there was an objection after the

court first, himself, spoke —
QUESTION:

After the judge alerted them to the

QUESTION: They also made a motion to strike.
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:
MR. FREY:

Well, I think they did, but —
They also made a motion to strike.
Well, of course, we think there was no

— the contention that we make is that they had no right to
have it stricken.
QUESTION: But they did make the motion?
MR. FREY:

Yes.

But we’re not relying on ~ we’re

not saying that they were silent to their det riment, we’re
not

saying that they should be penalized for any failure on

the part of defense counsel to do anything.
QUESTION:

What was this colloquy down on — in the

Appendix on — under the asterisks on page 5?

That was at

the conclusion of the evidence, when they were discussing the
instructions to the jury, was it?
MR. FREY:

No. That was shortly after, in connection

with the discussion of the — there was a request for a mistrial by the defense at that point.

One of the grounds on

which mistrial was requested was this improper cross-examina­
tion.

QUESTION 2

That was at the bench?

MR. PREY:

Yes.

And the court said:

I don’t think

you're entitled to a mistrial, because I think I've corrected
it.
Of course, we think the court's correction

was

incorrect.
QUESTION: And the jury didn't hear this?
MR. FREY:

The jury did not hear the material under

the asterisks; that’s correct.
I would like to save the remainder of my time for

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Ritchie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY J. RITCHIE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RITCHIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Prior to discussing whether the impeachment here was
really proper impeachment or not, I think it's important to
follow up on a few of the points that were just made with
regard to the prejudice that was involved.
We disagree that the Fifth Amendment isn't involved
here; indeed, we think the issue is whether the Fifth

28
Amendment was violated by the prosecution placing before the
jury this evidence of the defendant’s prior silence at the
police station»
The privilege gives the accused the right to remain
silent»

That right extends to both innocent and guilty alike?

the reasons for that are that the policy underlying the Fifth
Amendment really has nothing to do with protecting the guilty»
Rather, the privilege exists to protect our system
of criminal justice, the accusatory system, in which the
government has the burden of proving guilt»

They must

shoulder the entire load without any help from the defendant»
Such a system represents a fair state individual
balance in that it protects the individual from possible
inhumane treatment by the government, in trying to secure
statements from him which could be used against him»
It also insures the dignity of the individual by
insuring the individual the right to privacy.

Ho doesn’t

have to respond to the questions of the police? he doesn’t
have to dignify those questions, those accusations, by
responding to them.
Unfortunately, most laymen don’t know or don’t
understand the policy reasons behind, underlying the Fifth
Amendment.

The silence of the accused at the time of his

arrest is probably all too often equated with guilt.
is that possibility.

There

29

It was for that reason that the "no comment" rule was
really made a part of the Fifth Amendment by the Griffin case»
If the defendant elects to remain silent, then the
prosecution can't comment on

that silence because of the danger

that the jury will draw that impermissible inference of guilt.
The privilege would really be meaningless if the defendant had
the right to remain silent and then the prosecution could
bring out that silence to be used against him.
That danger is present whether the silence is brought
out in the case in chief, whether it's brought out in closing
argument, whether it's brought out on cross-examination in
/sic/

impeaching the jury.

silence is still before the jury, and

the jury still may draw that impermissible inference of guilt.
Instructions just can't cure that problem.
QUESTION: Well, that's true in the Griffin situation,
where the ~ in other words, where the defendant doesn’t elect
to take the witness stand at his own trial, that’s — the jury
sees that and is aware of it, and nobody can prevent whatever
inference they may draw from being drawn? isn't that true?
MR. RITCHIE:

That's correct. That’s why here the

danger is much more -QUESTION: Whereas, in this case —
MR. RITCHIE:
of his prior silence.
QUESTION; Right

— because the jury would not know

30
MR« RITCHIE:

Unless it were brought to the

attention of them by the prosecutor.
QUESTION:

And yet — and yet nobody's ever held

that the — and you couldn't, so long as there is a right of
the defendant not to testify at his trial; a fact that if he
doesn't testify, that th© jury is well aware of; that
obviously is not prejudicial error, is it?
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

The fact —

The jury's awareness of his silence at

his trial certainly is, with or without an instruction, is
not prejudicial error so long as the instruction is not that
they can draw an inference of the kind that —
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:
MR. RITCHIE:

Well, the —
— was made in the Griffin case.
— the

jury, by the instruction to

limit this to credibility, is really being told that they can
consider the silence in the — to infer that the defendant is
lying on the stand when he says that he is innocent, but
that they can't consider his silence to infer guilt.
I just don't think that the jury can really
successfully engage in such mental gymnastics and understand
that

explanation completely.
QUESTION:

Well, does it not, as Mr. Justice

Stewart just suggested, involve some struggle on the part of
the jury to listen perhaps for four or five days to witnesses

31
testifying against the defendant and then never hear from the
defendant?

Is there not some — somewhat the same kind of

problem there?
MR. RITCHIEs
QUESTION:

Yes, there is. The — in fact —

Can you think of any cure for that?

MR. RITCHIE:

The only cure for that is going back

many years ago before the federal statute and many State
statutes that were passed, relieving the defendant of his
incompetency to testify at all.

Indeed, that was the law

until the federal statute was passed a number of years

back.

One of the arguments has been, by some scholars in
Law Review articles, that that statute should never have been
passed because this inference could be drawn, if they don't
take the stand when they've got a right to.
The statute itself provided that no presumption shall
be drawn; but, you are correct, the fact that is before the
jury, they know he has the right to take the stand, and if he
does not, they can see that.
QUESTION:
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

But here —

When it's an uninstructed and unguided
Unguided «— they can see
— action on the part of the jury, then;

isn't it?
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And here they had — they did have the

benefit of some instruction on the subject, didn't they?

32
MR, RITCHIE:
see it, Your Honor»

They did, but here they couldn't
Here, it wasn't his refusal to take the

stand at his trial, here it was his refusal to speak at the
police station.

They had no way of knowing that; it wasn’t

something that they could see.
QUESTION;

Do you have any hypothesis to suggest

why, given your view of the case, your necessary view of the
case, that there wasn't an objection as soon as the first
question was asked, "Did you in any way indicate where that
money came from?"
Wouldn’t that, from your point of view,call for
an objection, right then and there?
MR. RITCHIE:
only go by the record.

I think it did, Your Honor.

I can

I don’t know what counsel was doing

at the time, whether he was rising to make an objection or
whether he just remained seated until the judge spoke; I don’t
know what happened»
QUESTION;

Well, it looks as though he at least

remained silent, whether seated or otherwise, until the judge
acted, and then he thanked the judge for intervening for,
in effect, making the objection»
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

That is the way the record appears.
At that time, from your point of

view, it was too late to do anything to remedy it?
MR. RITCHIE s

That is correct

33

QUESTION:

You think a mistrial should have been

granted?
MR. RITCHIE:

I do.

In Grunewaid -—
QUESTION:

You left out one points

a motion to strike.

they did male©

Or did you see that in the record?

MR. RITCHIEs

Yes.

After the judge initially made

his statement, there was a motion to strike, and follox^ing
that, shortly, there was a motion for a mistrial,
QUESTION:

Right? motion for mistrial.

And both

were denied.
MR. RITCHIE:

That is correct,

Grunewald itself discussed the prejudice because of
this possible impermissible inference of guilt being drawn
by the jury.

There, a credibility instruction had been given?

it was brought out

that Mr. Halperin was silent at the grand

jury for purposes of testing his credibility.

And there was,

in that case, an instruction telling the jury to consider it
only for purposes of

credibility.

In that case, the Court nevertheless found that the
instruction could not cure it? that the impermissible inference
was possible because the evidence had been placed before the
jury.
It is really that placing of the silence before the
jury which causes this impermissible inference of guilt which

34
may well be a bad thing, even where impeachment is proper? but
in this case, we would argue that impeachment wasn't proper
to begin with®
Obviously, one of the rules of evidence is that a
person can be impeached by prior inconsistent statements®
And the government is arguing that this case is similar to
Harris.

It is not, for two reasons®
The first reason is that Harris didn't really

involve a violation of the Fifth Amendment, it just involved
a violation of those procedural rules, those prophylactic
rules which were set out to protect the defendant against
possible violation of Fifth Amendment rights by police
officers.
QUESTION:

If there were no Fifth Amendment •— no

privilege against self-incrimination, just a9 a matter of
evidence and proof, you wouldn't argue that silence in the
facts of this case wouldn’t have been relevant — or that
some proper inference might have been drawn from the silence?
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:
MR. RITCHIE:

Yes, I would.
How is that?
The reason why silence would not be

relevant, the government’s argument is really that if the
defendant had this exculpatory testimony available to him,
he had been given the money by his wife, then when he was
arrested by the police he vnild have told them that.

He didn't

35

do that.

He was silent.
We think that that silence is, at best, ambiguous

conduct.

He has

> the defendant has just been arrested and

taken into the police station
QUESTION;

I knovr,but if the police say, "You

obviously stole this money? we're about to charge you with it",
and he says, "Wait,

Here's where I got the money."

You don't think there is some sort of an inference
there?
MR. RITCHIE:

No, I do not, and the reason I don't

is really twofold.
One reason is because of the fact that he was under
arrest.

With our mass media television shows, I think it's

common knowledge of a great deal of society that possibly the
best strategic policy to exercise at the police station is to
remain silent.

At least until he has an opportunity to confer

with counsel.

That is prevalent advice given by counsel to

their clients.
The defendant may be confused, embarrassed, he may
fear misquotation, he may fear misconstruction of his words.
There are a lot of reasons.
QUESTION:

But the hornbooks, I think, are solidly

against you on that point, absent Fifth Amendment considera-^
tions.

There may be many reasons that may be advanced by the

defendant after the evidence is adduced as to why it isn't

36

inconsistent.

But it tends to prove that,at least it

arguably proves that,

tod as long as it arguably proves

that, that's all you need to get it into evidence.
MR. RITCHIE:

Mr. Justice, there are a number of

State courts — and considering this sort of an issue with
regard to the tacit admission doctrine, if it had held that
arrest is a per se rule, indicates that silence after that
arrest is not probative, it is not an admission of guilt of
any form.
QUESTIONS

But isn't that in the context of the

Fifth Amendment?
MR. RITCHIE:

To some degree it is, but I think the

other tiling that we have to pay attention to her® is that the
police themselves have just told the defendant that he has the
right to remain silent, that he has the right not to answer
any questions until he confers with counsel.
have just told him that.

The interrogators

He is exercising his rights.

He’s doing what the interrogators have just told him he could
do.
I don't see how —
QUESTION:

Yes, but the fact that he was told he

could do it, doesn't mean that he's told he has to do it.
MR. RITCHIE:

No, it doesn't.

He is informed that

he has the right to remain silent, and that anything
may be used against him.

he says

37
QUESTIONg

Both of which are true and both of which

were relied on in this case»
MR. RITCHIE:

He might also infer that if he is

silent*, he will not get into any particular troubles

it will

not b® used against him.
QUESTIONS Well, that’s his inference, certainly? that’s
nothing that the police told him.
MR, RITCHIE:

No, but it's certainly implied, 1

think, in the warnings.

It wouldn’t be unreasonable for him to

get that sort of feeling from the warnings that are actually
given.
QUESTION?

Well, if it's a vested implication, why

isn't the best way to handle it as an evidentiary matter to say
that he can adduce that on redirect?
In other words, the government shows silence? he comes
back and says, "It was only natural.

I was scared..

I thought

maybe I should have remained silent."
Why not treat it as a factual issue, one that
rather than on© that depends on privilege?
MR. RITCHIEi

Well, I think that is a question where

the Fifth Amendment privilege does come into play, because of
the impermissible inference of guilt that’s associated with that
silence.
The jury, as I mentioned earlier, I don’t think will
be able to understand it.

As a matter of fact, they can't go

38

through the mental gymnastics in understanding this is only
for credibility and can't be used to infer guilt? and as a
matter of lav? **•*
*>

QUESTION:

Well, you're saying that Harris and

Walder and Oregon v. Hass are wrong, because that's exactly
what the jury was told in each of those cases»
MR» RITCHIE:

Those cases did not involve a violation

' ‘f

of the Fifth Amendment»

Those cases involved a statement by

the defendant which was clearly inconsistent»
QUESTION: Well, they involved a statement that was
made in violation of the Miranda rules, which you've described
as prophylactic and not part of the Fifth Amendment»
MR» RITCHIE:

That is correct»

QUESTION: Well, why are those rules any less a part
of the Fifth Amendment than the Griffin holding that comment
violates it?

I mean, that isn't written into the Fifth

Amendment»
MR» RITCHIE:
Amendment,

No, it isn't written into the Fifth

all these «tatters could be brought out (a) by his redirect

members of the jury presumably see as many television programs

can be explained often?

rebuttal.

These things could be brought out on

I just fear that the danger that’s involved here

is the jury not really understanding the policy reasons under­
lying the Fifth Amendment, that it does not necessarily mean
that a person is guilty? that inference may be drawn by them.
They are being told by the judge, in instructions ~™
QUESTXON: Well, of course, that objection goes to —■
if that's valid, then the whole business of impeachment of
credibility through questions which bring out such things as
prior offenses and so on would be invalid; and yet that’s been
accepted in —
MR. RITCHIE *

Well, I think we’ve got a special

danger here, where the Fifth Amendment is involved.
QUESTION:

If your argument is that the jury will not

be able to comprehend the limiting instructions as to the use
of what was brought out on cross-examination, that's a very
broad attack on the whole use of impeachment —
MR. RITCHIE:

Oh, I think not.

In the normal

40

situation, where impeachment is being used, I don’t think
there is anywhere near the danger that the jury is going to
misunderstanda
QUESTION:
MRa RITCHIE:

Prior offenses and so on,
Prior offenses and -- it’s a great

deal different, I think, in the privilege against selfincrimination»
QUESTION:

And prior inconsistent testimony, not

in this context?
MR» RITCHIE:

That’s right.

Yes, Your Honor,

The defendant who is testifying in front of the jury,
I think it must be remembered, obviously is going to be looked
at by the jury as a person who has a special interest in the
case.

In fact, they will be told that by instructions, more

than likely.

And I think that vrith those instructions, with

his position in the case, it's going to be hard for them to
rationally understand any explanation that they might have
and to feel strongly about it and believe that over the
possible inference of guilt that may be drawn from his prior
silence,
QUESTION:

Mr, Ritchie, I wonder if almost all of

your arguments would not also be directed at the wellaccepted rule that unexplained possession of recently stolen
property affords the jury an opportunity to draw an inference
of guilt, not just an inference of want of reliability as a

41
witness, or credibility, but an inference of guilt.
MR. RITCHIE :

I think not.

In the Barnes situation,

in the recent presumption from recently — possession of
recently stolen property, if in fact in this case Mr. Hale had
money on him which was marked in some way that clearly could
be tied to the complaining witness, then I don't think he would
be required to tell the police, to explain to the police his
possession of the money.
Rather, it's a question more of trial tactics.

The

inference from the possession is a reasonable one, which he can
choose, at his trial, to either get up and explain or to let
the jury draw the inference.

He has the advantage of counsel

defending here, that the police station doesn't have the
advantage of counsel.
QUESTION:

What if, in this particular situation,

the evidence of the government showed that the amount stolen
from the victim was $157.33, and that that turned out to be
precisely the amount of money in his pocket when they caught
up with him, and that the denominations corresponded to the
denominations of the money taken, would you ~ where would
that fall?

Would that fall into the category of possession of

recently stolen property or where would it fall, in your
view?
MR. RITCHIE:

It may.

Again, I think, in that

sittiation the only thing that Mr. Hale would be required to do,

42

would feel any pressure about at all, x*ould be at his trial,
to make a determination of v/hether he is going to take the
stand to rebut the inference that the jury may draw from that
fact.
Again, here, we're talking about Mr. Hale at the
police station, where he has just been arrested, he does not
have counsel present, there is no — there should be no
pressure on him to explain at that time to the police»
QUESTION»

Of course, Mr» Justice Frankfurter's

opinion, to be sure, it was a concurring opinion, not an
opinion of the Court, was to the effect that in the ordinary
run of the generality of human experience, if people have an
explanation, a valid explanation, they give it» and that
therefore the failure to do what is found to be the generality
of human experience is something a jury is entitled to hear
about and consider»
But I take it you would reject Mr. Justice Frank­
furter’s view on the matter?
MR» RITCHIE»

Yes, I would»

That view was expressed

prior to the time that the "no comment" rule was held — or
that the Fifth Amendment, excuse me, was held applicable to
States, in a State case; and I just would reject that view»

Well, aren't you giving up more than you

In this case, I would assume that he’d take the

43
position that that small amount of money he had, he had no
obligation to do it.
MR. RITCHIE:

Mo, that is correct; I take that

position.
QUESTION: Well, you haven't abandoned that, I hope.
MR. RITCHIE:

Oh, no, I certainly have not.

QUESTION: Well, if it were $5,000 and it had been a
bank robbery or a supermarket robbery, where they'd have that
kind of money these days, would you say that the rule of law
would be different?

Five thousand instead of a hundred and

fifty?
MR. RITCHIE:

No, I would not.

Still I don't think

he would have to explain that at the police station.
QUESTION:

VJell, that isn't quite consistent with

what, at least, I understood you to respond to Mr. Justice
Marshall,
MR. RITCHIE:

The pressure to explain at trial by

the presumption that exists when a person is found in possession
of recently stolen property is a different sort cf pressure
than the pressure at the police station, that a defendant might
feel to talk to the police.
QUESTION:

I'm talking about the explanation at the

same point in time, the only difference from this case in my
hypothetical -«*
MR. RITCHIE:

QUESTION:

■— is five thousand dollars, or,to

make it clearer, twenty thousand dollars,,
But you think there is no more — the government
could make no more use of his unexplained possession of twenty
thousand dollars than of one hundred and fifty?
MR, RITCHIE:

I’m sorry, Your Honor,

You’re talking

about at trial now.
In that case it seems to me that before the presump­
tion that arises from the possession of recently stolen
property can corns into effect, the property must be shown to
be the recently stolen property.

It may be that the

circumstances would be such as the two

And if that's the case, then

the inference may properly be drawn.
We certainly don't have that case here,
QUESTION:

But the only difference is the amount

of the money, isn't it?
MR, RITCHIE:

It's the amount of the money.

He

had $123 in his pocket, $35 in his wallet; total of 158.
The complaining witness initially told the police 65 had
been stolen; he later changed that to 96.
There is a difference in the amount of the money.
There’s no way to necessarily link that to the money that was
actually taken

45

QUESTIONS

Mr. Ritchie, in light of Justice Harlan's

opinion in Grunewald, is

it necessary for you to rely as

strongly as you do on the Fifth /unendment?
MR.RITCHIE:

Well, I think it is, for the reason that

Grunewald was a case in which the Court exercised their
supervisory power over the lower federal courts.
QUESTION:

It was not a constitutional decision.

MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Now, the four dissenting Justices would

have made it a constitutional holding.
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So the majority decision really turned, as

I read it, on the question of whether or not the evidence had
probative value in light of the Fifth Amendment..
MR. RITCIIIE: That is correct, Your Honor.
The reason why I have to rely on the constitutional
argument is really because this case is a case arising under
the laws of the District of Columbia.

And, as this Court has

held in the Griffin case —* in the other Griffin, Griffin vs.
the District of Columbia, and in the Johnson case, when the
local federal district court is sitting on a case which involves
the trial of an offense applicable only to the District of
Columbia, it will be considered to be acting as a local court.
That being the case, there would be no federal super­
visory power over the courts in this case.

46
QUESTION: Well, is that still true, after the D. C»
Court Reorganization Act, do you think?
MR. RITCHIE:
Reorganization Act.

Yes, I do. This was prior to the

This case was tried back in 1971»

QUESTION:

MR» RITCHIE:

So it was tried in federal district court»
QUESTION:

Today it would have to be tried in the

Superior Court.
MR. RITCHIE:

Today it would be tried in the

Superior Court.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

But certainly there is still some supervisory power,
is there not, at least over the federal district courts in the
District of Columbia?
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think there is.
I mean there's just a non-constitutional

error is all that — in a federal trial, is what supervisory
power means.
MR. RITCHIE:

The government has argued that there

would be no — by the ruling that it seeks, there would be no
way that the police could possibly violate — use such a
ruling to violate the rights of the accused.

47
I just want to disagree with that, because I think
that if indeed the government gets the ruling they're seeking
in this case, where a defendant's silence can be used against
him, they can confront him at the station house with a very
similar sort of technique, as mentioned in Miranda? when they
were discussing the police manuals in Miranda, they pointed out
that one technique mentioned was where the police officer tells
to the accused*

"Joe, you've got the right to remain silent*

I'm not going to take that right away from you? I wouldn't do
anything to do that.

But if you don't tell me or explain to me

what the situation is, if you remain silent, I'll have to
assume that you're guilty.

You can certainly see that.

And

everybody else will assume the same thing,"
That sort of statement by the police was viewed in
Miranda as amounting to a form of psychological coercion, and
I think it does, if the government seeks — gains the rule
they seek today, then the police could properly tell the
accused that, it would be a proper statement to give them.
That would result in a great deal of pressure being
placed on the defendant's right to remain silent at the police
station.

He can invoke that right to remain silent only

on the condition that it may be used in evidence against him,
an impeachment.
It seems to me that puts a great deal of pressure
on him to talk, to give up his right to remain silent.

It does

48
result in a cost, exacts a cost on the privilege,,
1 think the government in relying

on Williams and

McGautha and Barnes really overlooks the fact that in those
cases where trial tactics was often discussed, the defendant
had counsel.

Here, the defendant has just been arrested at

the police station, he did not have counsel.
This wasn't a question of trial tactics on his part.
He didn't have counsel, he didn't have any idea, he had —
maybe what his defense would be — he hadn't conferred with
counsel.

I think there's a great deal of difference between

this case and between the cases of McGautha and Williams,

and

Barnes.
As far as waiver is concerned, the government argues
that by taking the stand he waived his right to remain silent.
In a single proceeding, obviously taking the stand will waive
the right to remain silent.

He must answer the questions.

He must not evade questions directed to him by the prosecution.
If he does, then the jury could possibly infer guilt and
maybe rightly so.

But here we're talking about two separate

arrest, and the right to remain silent at his trial.
There is no reason for the waiver by taking the
stand to be a retroactive waiver.
In the Raffel case, which is relied on by counsel,
the only basis which was suggested for extending the scope

of the waiver — or against extending the scope of the waiver,
was the possible pressure on the defendant to testify at his
first trial.

The court rejected that because that pressure

He couldn't anticipate that he would get a mistrial.
Here, on the other hand, at the police station he

may well expect to have a trial.

He's probably looking

forward to one,.
QUESTION:

Let me see if I understand you.

You

feel that an affirmance her© would result in an overruling of
Raffel?
MR, RITCHIE:

I'm not sure that it would,

I think

Raffel has been limited to its facts pretty much by more recent
cases, by Stewart, in particular,

Grunewald and Stewart both

fail to follow Raffel.
QUESTION:

But they didn't overrule it,

MR, RITCHIE:

They did not overrule it.

QUESTION: And it was a unanimous opinion in a court
which included Justices Holmes and Brandeis,
MR. RITCHIE:
QUESTION:

That is correct,
In fact, Justice Brandeis wrote the

opinion,
MR, RITCHIE:

That is correct.

Thank you,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREYs

Thank you.

1*11 try to be quick.

The reason ray opponent can’t rely on Grunewald, Mr.
Justice Powell, is that I think on a fair reading of
Grunewald it nor© closely supports us than then.
The kind of analysis in which the Court engaged in
Grunewald would not lead to the same conclusion as applied
to the facts of this case.
With respect to what Mr. Hale could reasonably
infer from the warning that was given to him at the time he
was arrested, I don't think he could reasonably infer that
his silence wouldn't hurt him.
his silence would hurt him.
be charged with a crime.

There are many ways in which
His silence would cause him to

His silence would cause him to

lose the opportunity to neutralize the piece of evidence.
His silence might cause him to lose whatever opportunity he
had to get this money back.
The silence carries many prices.

The price of

possible impeachment if he*3 brought to trial and if he
decides to testify, by his silence, seems to me a very remote
one, very unlikely to control his conduct at the time,
extremely unlikely to put impermissible pressure on him
in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

51
And I think it*s important to note that his silence
was not the product of any violation of the Fifth Amendment,
Obviously, his right to remain silent was honored.
And even then I think that it's by no means clear that, what was
referred to in Miranda as the right to remain silent is
actually a Fifth Amendment right.
You have a right not to be compelled to speak , and
Michigan v. Tucker suggests that that right is somewhat
different and somawhat more narrow, and it might be more accurate
if the Miranda warnings, instead of describing a right to remain
silent, advised the arrestee that he has no obligation to speak
or perhaps that he can't be compelled to speak.
In any event, I think there was no real likelihood
of prejudicial effect.

By "prejudicial effect", what is meant

is that the jury will impermissibly draw an improper conclusion?
and I don't think that could be the case here.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Frey.

Thank you, Mr. Ritchie.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2j19 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
