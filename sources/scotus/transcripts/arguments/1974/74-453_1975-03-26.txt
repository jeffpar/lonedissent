direct appeal from the three-judge district court in which
the Appellants seek a reversal.
Nor will we consider except in passing the subsidia­
ry issue breeched in Appellant's main brief at points

5

and 6 and in Appellee's brief on the merits at 4, 5 and 6.
In New York, shelter is a separate component of
assistance that every individual receives.

The other

component that the recipient receives is a per person flat
grant for food, clothing and incidentals.
The amount paid for shelter, or the shelter
allowance is variable and depends on two factors:

the

actual on the dwelling in vxhlch the recipients up to maximum
J

established by number of rooms or number of recipients who,
in fact, live there and two, it is based on the percentage of
recipients in relation to the total number of individuals
who live in a particular dwelling.
The result of the computation of shelter allowances;,
in light of these factors, results in the finding that in
New York every recipient who receives 100 percent of his per
capita standard of need for his individual shelter needs
determined in light of his actual participation or his share
of the dwelling in which he lives and in relation to the
actual or maximum allowed rent on that dwelling under the
system, no New York recipient can receive the entire cost of
vhe dvjelling unless he is, in fact, the exclusive occupant of

5
that dwelling

since to do so would be to attribute or

transfer the needs of the other individuals who live there
to the recipient.
Equally, no New York recipient receives e fixed or
averaged allowance based on the shelter needs of a hypo­
thetical recipient such as are provided under flat grant
systems.
To assure the Court that in stating that New York
the
needs 100 percent of / per capita standard of need of its
recipients in terms of their shelter and to assure you that
we are hot masking the realities by omitting consideration
of the substance of the standard of needs, we note that the
maximums involved, the maximums under which the — the maximums which provide the feeling under which the shelter
allowances are computed, are provided by the 58 local
services — social services districts which comprise the
state — that is intended by the State Department of Social
Services as expressed directly in its pertinent regulations,
that the maximum be set at levels which provide shelter for
recipients in conformity with local standards and that the
maximums are updated from time to time as appears on the
face of them in the Appendix at pages 523 to 603 and that
the maximums themselves are subject to exceptions in favor
of the recipient which are commonly made by local authorities
to b© sure that shelter is, in fact, provided to the

6
recipient.
The point is demonstrated most clearly by the
uncontested statement in the record below that approximately
93 percent of New York recipients receive shelter allowances
equal to their full cost.
Thus, the standard of shelter needs is actual cost
for the vast majority of New York recipients.
QUESTION:

Are we talking about the AFDC program

only, or others?
MRS. GORDON:

This is for both the AFDC program

and the Home Relief program, those being the only two
remaining programs that are subject to direct state super­
vision since the federal SSI takeover.

And the 93 percent

refers to both categories.
QUESTION:

AFDC and Home Relief.

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

AFDC and Home Relief.

And there is federal participation in

Home Relief, is there?
MRS. GORDON:

No, there is no federal participation

in Home Relief.
QUESTION:

Wholly state funds.

MRS. GORDON:

That is wholly state and locally

financed.
The question of whether New York must subsidize
shelter costs of the nonrecipient who shares a dwelling

7
with the recipient of AFBC or Home Relief is presented in
the specific context of Appellee’s challenge to Section
352.30(b) of the Social Services title of the New York Code
of Rules and Regulations and is limited to the portion of
that regulation which prorates the actual or maximum
allowed rent for a dwelling shared between recipient and
nonrecipient when that recipient pays less than $15 a
month.
This nonrecipient is called a non-contributing
or nonpaying lodger under the terms of the regulation.
The result of the proratlon under this portion
of the regulations is the determination of the per capita
cost for each individual who lives in the dwelling and
the payment of shelter allowances equal to the per capita
shares or the need of the recipients while no public
subsidy is

provided in the form of a shelter allowance or

by other means for the needs of the nonpaying, nonrecipient
lodger.
Section 352.30(b) contains an additional pro­
vision for contributing lodgers who are defined again as
nonrecipients who share dwellings with recipients but as
individuals who pay $15 or more or $60 or more per month,
depending on whether they are simply lodgers or boarding
lodgers.
The contributing lodgerfe payment is income to the

8
recipient and results In a pro tanto reduction of the total
assistance benefits paid to the recipient with the exception
that the recipient is permitted to retain the first $15 or
$60 paid as an income exemption or disregard.
Notwithstanding the permanent Injunction contained
in the judgment and order of the District Court, again, this
contributing lodger portion of the regulation, the Appellees
did not place this provision at issue below and concede it
to be valid in their briefs before this Court at pages 9k
to 95.
As stated, the lodgers in both categories» whether
non-paying or contributing are nonrecipients.
In add5,tion, under the terms of the regulation,
these nonrecipients are individuals who do not owe the
recipients with whom they live any duty of support and con­
comitantly, the recipients — and thus the state, who is
supporting the recipients, owes the lodger no duty of support.
However, the lodger, like all other individuals,
bears the primary responsibility for his own support and this
responsibility attaches to him regardless of whether he lives
in a separate dwelling or whether he shares a dwelling with
recipient.
It continues until such time as the lodger receives
assistance, when that primary obligation is assumed by the
state

9
In this sense, the lodger is, in fact — and is
here ruder the terras of the regulation — is having the
same obligations of selfsupport a3 all individuals in
society who are not on assistance.
It is this primary responsibility or legal
obligation of the lodger that is recognized by the regula­
tion and NOAA.
In light of the holding of the District Court —
of the three-judge

District Court majority to the affect

that the nonpaying lodger provision presumes diminished
shelter need when that might not, in fact, be the case,
and Appellees repeated assertions that the regulation
necessarily results in reduced shelter allowances, it Is
appropriate to review briefly the two factual situations in
which the nonpaying lodger provision operates which show,
in effect, that both these contentions are incorrect.
First, when an individual is added to a

dwelling,

after recipient’s shelter needs were originally budgeted,
under these circumstances, the preexisting per capita cost
of the recipient's share must be reevaluated to reflect
the fact that the shelter needs of an additional individual
are being met and that the actual or allowed rent is now
allocable among the increased number of individuals.
Two results follow:

a reduction in per capita

shelter need and cost of the recipient and a consequent

10
reduction in the shelter alloxtfance.
How, this result occurs regardless of whether the
individual who is added to the dwelling is a nonrecipient
herein a lodger or whether he is , Indeed, a recipient
individual and it is illustrated by the example of •— by
taking the example of the situation where we have, for
example, a group of AFDC recipients living in a

dwelling.

A point in time comes when a Home Relief recipient
is added to that dwelling unit.
The result, under the New York program, :1s to reduce
the per capita shelter costs of the APDC recipient and to
pay the proportionate share now held by the Home Relief
recipient from the Home Relief program.
Now, under the specific terms of the regulation at
issue, when the individual that 13 added to the dwelling is
a nonrecipient and nonpaying, we recognise these facts in
the regulations by not providing a subsidy for the nonrecipient and by recognizing as well that since that
recipient is nonpaying, perforce, a share of that shelter
cost will remain unpaid.
The fact that the shelter cost, a share

will remain

unpaid, does not mean that the preexisting shares were not,
in fact, reduced when the lodger moved into the dwelling,
since the lodger is, in fact, meeting his own needs by his
additional beneficial use of the premises, nor does it mean

11
that the lodger’s — the recipient’s shares can be increased
If the lodger doesn’t pay, by transferring of the lodger's
shelter needs to the recipient group.
The second situation in which the nonpaying lodger
provision operates but does not reduce allowances is shown
by the facts in support of Appellee Taylor'3 claim.
When APDC recipients share a dwelling with Home
Relief recipients and one or the other recipient groups
loses its eligibility and thus may become a nonpaying
lodger under the terms of the regulations the per capita
cost of that individual is, again, not compensated.
However, since the number of individuals in the
dwelling remain the same, the valuation of the preexisting
shares also remains the same and there is no reduction in
the shelter allowance as payable to the remaining
recipients.
Thus, when Appellee Taylor and her minor child
received APDC and Appellee’s sister received Home Relief,
the maximum allowed rent for the apartment was prorated
two-thirds to APDC and one-third to HR for Appellee's
sister.
When Appellee’s sister lost her home relief
eligibility and became a nonpaying lodger, Appellee’s minor
child and her

Appellee and her minor child continued to

receive exactly the same shelter allowance, two—thirds from

ia
the AFDC program and without any reduction obviously.
The nonpaying nonrecipienfc, Appellee’s sister, the
valuation of the share of the nonpaying nonrecipient, remained,
again, the same.

The only difference between the Home Relief

and p03t-Home Relief situation Is that that share, to wit,
Virginia Taylor’s share, was not being paid.
The fact that the share —
QUESTION:

It meant that the Taylors — what was

it, mother and son — had — were stuck for the entire rent
although the total group was getting the one-third less
shelter relief than before.
MRS. GORDON:

That’s about it, isn’t it?

That is exactly the point I was

coming to, your Honor.
The fact that the lodger's share remains unpaid does
not, I believe — and I think we can illustrate — result in
inevitable or drastic consequences for the remaining reci­
pient .
Rather, it places the recipient and the lodger,
herein Appellee Taylor and her sister, in the situation where
they may choose among several among several alternatives.
First, the lodger may pay his share of shelter
costs or possibly somewhat less and obtain the benefits of
the contributing lodger's side of the regulation which we
cited.
Second, if the lodger is truly needy — as it was

13
claimed Virginia Taylor was — she or he may apply for
assistance which is made available in

New York to everyone

and at 100 percent of the standard of needs.
Now, in terms of applying for assistance, the
individual obtains a grant or allowance measured to meet
his own needs which, of course, includes

the shelter cost

and the per person flat grant.
QUESTION:

Does the availability of that added

kind of relief bear on the statutory question or the
constitutional question or both?
MRS. GORDON:

If I understand you correctly,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you asked me whether or not the fact
that any individuals had obtained assistance bears on the
operation of this regulation.
QUESTION:

Well, I didn't ask whether it bears on

the operation of the regulation.

I asked you if it bears on

the statutory question that is involved in this case on a
constitutional question or on both.
MRS. GORDON:

I don’t think it would bear on the

statutory question because the statutory question is limited
in this case to the APDC program and the consistency of this
regulation with the APDC program.
I don’t think it would be material to the deter­
mination of that consistency whether, under other programs,
other individuals could get aid and we will come to a

discussion of the relationship o.f the APDC statutes to that
point.
Noxtf, in terms of constitutionality, while I believe
that a regulation which had a uniform, rational and fair
operation would obviously be sustained under a due process or
equal protection argument.

It might be an argument under

that — under either clause that since there was no avail—■ if,
in fact, there were no availability of this supplemental type
of assistance

in New York that the operation might operate,

the regulation might operate so harshly as to be so arbitrary
and capricious as to deny due process.
However, that Is, in fact, not the case since we
do apply — we do have the supplemental assistance program.
Now, returning to the alternatives available to the
recipient who lives with the nonpaying lodger, as I was noting,
the» nonpaying lodger may obtain his own share of assistance
and thus provide himself with

his own means of support and

generally increase the maximum allowed rent available to the
combined unit.
Now, this course of action was, in fact, followed
by the former lodgers in the Otey claim and by Virginia Taylor
who, I should note in response to your question, Mr. Justice
Stewart, is — lost her original eligibility on Home Relief,
apparently through

her own fault.

The record shows that —

the status of the record on this is not extensive but the

15
record does show in an affidavit of Marvin Rachlin from
Nassau County that she failed to comply with continuing
eligibility requirements.

She; thereafter, having lost her

Home Relief assistance, reapplied, got Aid to the Disabled
and has since been transferred to the SSI program.
The third alternative is that the lodger may
leave the dwelling and thus remove the basis for the
diminution of the recipient’s allowances if, in fact, his
addition to the dwelling caused the diminution.
Fourth, he may stay in the dtselling and hope to
have the recipients meet his shelter needs from the balance
of the assistance funcfeprovided for themselves, namely, the
per-person flat grant for food, clothing and incidentals.
Now, Mrs. D'Alessio, an applicant for interven­
tion below, stated that this is the course of action that
she would choose

in order to hold her lodger in her home.

However, obviously, in view of the three other
alternatives which we have just noted, this course of
action is not the inevitable or even the intended result
of the operation of the regulation and it is doubtful that
it could be long pursued consistently with the goal of the
AFDC program and the state's responsibilities under it,
namely, the protection of the children or even as a practi­
cal matter if the lodger, in fact, paid nothing.
Now, we are compelled to note that Appellee's

16
position in this action doss not alleviate the alleged
harshness of this alternative, to wit, the lodger staying in
the house and eating and living off the

flat grants pro­

vided by the recipient.
As noted on the D'Alessio claim, the situation is
trought about under the facts of these cases because it is
claimed that the lodger is destitute.
However, on Appellee’s view, which would eliminate
'

.

’ - 4'*o

pro-ration of shelter allowances, for any — under all
circumstances where the — as Appellees would characterise it where the individual lodger refuses to apply his available
resources to meet his own need3 and thus cuts off the desti­
tute lodger and the rich lodger as well.
Now, given that Appellee states that the refusal
to apply his available resources to meet his own needs, or
the refusal to obtain such resources from the pjdbllc assistance
program, the result of the combination df those fcwo factors
is that the lodger who remains in the home on Appellee's
view still must obtain the balance of his support from the
flat grant provided for the recipient individual.
Now, as we have noted, Section 352 functions
essentially in two factual situations, both of which look
at the lodger after the recipient's shelter heeds were first
budgeted and generally where the recipients were the first
dependents in' the dwelling."

17
We have also noted that the computation of the
shelter allowance, under the New York program, depends in
part on the percentage of recipients who live in the
dwelling.
Thus we come to an additional regulation in the
same title of the State Code of Rules and Regulations,
Section 352.3(c) where, if the recipients move into a
-

4

dwelling occupied by a lodger, they, In their turn again
receive prorated shares of the shelter cost of that dwelling
r

'I

up to an appropriate maximum to meet their own needs.
Thus, in factually similar circumstances, we have
factually similar regulations, 'both of which are designed
to meet %he individual needs of the recipient's"'where the
Individual needs of the recipient, regardless of whether
he lives with a lodger or a lodger lives
?

with him.

Indeed, proration is itself illustrated between

recipients and recipients on the Taylor claim as we noted,
Mr. Justice Stewart, when we pointed out that when Virginia
was on the Home Relief program and the Appellee and her
child were on AFDC, there was, in effect, a preration as
between'those two programs.
Now, in subsidizing the shelter needs of the
recipient and

withholding a subsidy for the shelter needs

of the nonpaying lodger, Section 353.30(b) is a direct
expression of the Social Security Act provision providing

18
for Aid to Families with Dependent Childrens related state
statutes and with implementing legislation under the
pardon me — and with state statutes implementing the federal
program as well as state statutes governing the Home Relief
program.
We do not even reach3 in this cases the traditional
question presented on the statutory side of AFDC cases,
namely, whether the challenged state regulation imposes an
additional condition of eligibility inconsistent with the
federal statutes.
Indeed, the condition of eligibility required here,
qualified recipient status, is the exact same condition
imposed by the AFDC program itself.
Now, the federal legislation setting forth the
AFDC program is set forth in some detail in our main brief at
point one.
In sum, that legislation defines the class of
aided Individuals for AFDC In a manner which excludes the
nonpaying lodger.

This is so principally because the lodger

has not demonstrated his eligibility for assistance.
In short, he is hot paid because he is not a
recipient.
Appellees point out In addition, and interestingly,
that the lodger could obtain assistance under the AFDC
program, as he could obtain assistance under Horn® Relief and

19
this is, In fact, true.

He can obtain assistance as an

essential person; indeed, the fact Mrs. D,Alessio alleges
would have made her lodger, H.M. conceivably an essential
person under APDC.
They failed to note, however, that the major
criterion for an essential person is, of course, that
criterion which is applicable to all APDC individuals,
namely, demonstration of need.
Now, the federal and state statutes and regu­
lations recognise as well tvhat is obviously commonsense and
in fact, true, that people who receive APDC — and, indeed,
people who receive Home Relief, may well choose to live
with nonrecipients and then when that set of circumstances
occurs, it is necessary, in order to follow the mandate of
the legislation to separate the needs of the nonreoipients
or the person who does not come within the aided classes
under the federal program, from the needs of the recipients.
QUESTION:
rule 44(1)?

Mrs. Gordon, are you familiar with our

it says that Court looks with disfavor on any

oral argument that is read from a prepared text.
I thought perhaps I noticed you were reading.
MRS. GORDON:

I apologise.

First, your Honor, I

am not familiar with the Court's rule.
Second, I apologize, to the extent that I am :Ln
part reading although I am not entirely reading.

20

QUESTION:

And you have a lot of company In this

Court.
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Yes, I know.

Especially from Government counsel.

MRS. GORDON:

As I was noting,, the federal legis­

lation notes that which is obvious, namely that dwellings
may be shared in common and that when that is, in fact, the
case, it' is necessary to separate one need from another in
order to compensate only those needs of the recipient.
Novi, this matter is easily accomplished in New
York which, as we noted at the outset, treats shelter as a
separate item of need; a' matter, again, with HEW approval
and with reference to this record established by a document
called ’'Simplified Methods of Determining Meeds" published in
j-964

and, indeed, these statutes and the regulations recoQ-nize

and the program material, recognize that shelter allowances
may be computed on an individualized basis, such as the
system which New York effectively has adopted.
Proration with the result of withholding the non­
recipient's share, is again expressly recognized by HEW in
that same 1964 document and has been recognized with express
reference to this regulation by the approval of the HEW
Region II commissioner extended to this' regulation specifically
in the course of this litigation.
Indeed, IIEW’s policy has continued then, to date, as
■«•v- -

21
is shown In the most recent document we have available to
us, namely, “Guidelines for Development of Consolidated
APDC

Standards," wherein HEW provides some recommendations

for states who wish to shift to a flat grant, noting that
the effect of the flat grant system is to average away
differences caused by proration between recipients and
nonrecipients, thus stating, in effect, that for systems
for states who do not adopt the flat grant system, that
proratj.on of rental policy is, of course, still in effect.
QUESTION:

Long is 352.30?

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

How long is it?

When was it enacted?

MRS. GORDON:

It was enacted specifically, your

Honor, I believe in 1970.

We have several appendixes on

that.
QUESTION:

Umn hmn.

MRS. GORDON:

’70 or *72 In terms — in the

express terms that It presently has.
In approximately 1965, I believe, provisions were
added to the social services title Code which reflected the
separation and proration of lodgers' needs.
Now, the means of proration and the element
Included in that system has varied from time to time and,
certainly, of course, we are only concerned with the last
one.
In Appellees' brief at pages 1A through 4A, they

22

cits some of the historical provisions and additional
provisions appear in the Appendix under the appropriate
heading.
QUESTION:

Did New York ever have a rule of the

kind that was held invalid in King against Smith?
MRS. GORDON:

Absolutely not,

Your Honor.

New

c

York never had a man-in-the-house rule.

In fact, I was

Just coming to the portion of my argument where I was
about to state that the regulation here involved is not a
man-in-the-house rule.
This is apparent, first, by the terms of the
regulations and the facts in support of the Otey, Taylor and
Aloise claims which show that the lodger category is not
confined to paramours but may include sons, sisters and
male and female friends of various kinds.
Second and more importantly, unlike King and Lewis
it does not depend, that is, this regulation does not
depend on a fictitious

obligation of support running from

the lodger to the caretaker-relative or to the children, to
the extent either of their entire needs, as in King or to
the extent ot the lodger’s available resources as in Lewis,
Rather, two obligations are considered by the
regulation or perhaps one is a lack of obligation.
The lack of. any legally-imposed obligation on the
part of the caretaker to support the lodger and, indeed, the

23
obligation, as we previously noted, of the lodger to support
himself — at least primarily and until such time as he comes
to the state for assistance.
In light of these facts, Appellees repeated use of
the term "payment for the family's expense" is a complete
misnomer.

The expense involved is that of the lodger and his

prorata share is that share whic

is assigned to meet his

own needs.
Nov/, turning briefly to the constitutional —
principal constitutional Issues presented, we find that the
nonpaying lodger provision does not depend on

any irrebuttable

presumption in violation of the 14th Amendment.
This claim must be viewed In light of the facts, as
we have noted, that we are concerned here with a system of
Individualized shelter needs which confront the realities of
the real world in terms of the recipient needs In that world,
that the regulations involved express directly or at least
clearly complement the federal APDC legislation involved and,
indeed, the federal HEW program material and wh ich s if they
do not mandate, they certainly allow the exclusion of the
lodger's needs and, again, we are confronted with a situation
where ttfe federal regulations and statutes, if they do not
mandate one particular system of determining shelter
allowances, certainly allow this system and possibly a
system based on average amounts as well.

2k

Nov;, of the federal legislation here, and,
Indeed, the major state statutory provisions are challenged
as unconstitutional.
In short, the underlying legislation which
provides the basis on which this system operates is
conceded by Appellees to be constitutional.

It doesn't

violate the due process clause at all.
We then come to their point where they say, but
these regulations which neither directly implement or
complement the system violate the due process clause.
Nov;, in terms of presumptions we must add one
further a act and that is, this entire shelter* allowance
program and, indeed, regulation 352.30(b) operates in the
context where a hearing is, in fact, provided.
That hearing is provided following — at the
recipient's x’equest and following the investigation of the
facts of every case in which a proposed reduction in the
allowance is about to take place and it follows this
Court's decision in Goldberg versus Kelly and, indeed, it
is a prereduction hearing.
Nov;, we have already noted -- or perhaps I should
point up the fact that under the statutory side of —

Mrs. Gordon, would you tell me in just

Is it because it

inevitably3 is living off the state when he isn*t qualified
to do so?

Or are you assuming some contribution?
MRS. GORDON:

No, your Honor, we are not

assuming any kind of contribution.
reason for the regulation is the

We are — the principal
first

two stated,

namely, the conservation of the public assistance resources
for those who are truly needy and the av’oidsaice c?f diversion
of those resources for the benefit of those who are not
needy.
Now, interestingly —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Gordon, do you say you are

\

the state entitled to withhold funds that are obviously
being used to support someone who isn’t entitled to it?
MRS. GORDON:

That is absolutely correct, your

Honor and particularly one must realize that the lodger here
lo a stranger to the system.

The system does not investi—

gate him to any extent or degree because he has not come
before the Government and sought aid.
QUESTION:

What does the state do if it discovers

that some welfare or some APDC mother is giving $15 a month
to her mother who lives down the street?

She Just isn’t

spending it on the support of her own children or of her­
self but .ls giving $15 a month to her mother who lives in
another establishment.
MRS. GORDON:

There are both

eiviil and

26
criminal penalties available — civil penalties, shall we
say, as well as criminal penalties available under the
present system.

But I would say first —-

Can you recover the money —

One is the flat

rent although — because it is provided for her own needs,
not that of her mother —but she is permitted to do that to
some extent ana degree because she has a discretionary choice
of allocation.
What we watch out

for most is whether the interests

of the child remain protected.

If, in fact, as Judge Oakes

suggested in the Second Circuit — in his Second Circuit
dissent, she can afford, because she has made wise discretion"
ary allocations of the money, to leave a. dollar on a collectlon plate on Sunday from that flat grant, we do net do that.
Now, when the interest of the child becomes
involved, we have various forms of counseling that we can

there some other way that the state can solve this problem
of diversion other than doing what it — just doing what
it does?

way it i3, without reduction, the child doesn’t have as
much space as you thought it was going to have because the
lodger has moved in and is sharing the space.

MRS. GORDON:

Two points should be made clear.

Number one, in your $15 to the mother down the street
example, the child was not getting the benefit of that
money and that ■—
QUESTION:

That is right.

MRS. GORDON:

— payment was harming the child.

Now one could say, I shall — in that example — put. that
amount of money for the specific purpose, namely rent, on
restricted payment so she won't have the opportunity to give
it to her mother down the street —if she gave part of the
shelter allowance.

28
Well, obviously, that won * t work in the lodger
situation.

We could do as Judge Oakes suggested.

We could

pay the money to the woman and sue the lodger — or sue both
of them at the end of the given month on the theory that he
had

obtained money or had received the benefit of a grant

intended for another.
Now, the difficulty with that theory, your Honor,
is that if we assume that — or if it is true that we can
recover the money from the lodger — it is perfectly clear
that we didn't have to pay it to him in the first place and
if we entered it — or to her in the first place -— we did
:

'

'■

\

not have to pay it for his benefit in the first place and if
we entered into a system on the shelter side where we sought
to recover the amounts of the lodger's shelter benefit from
the lodger, we would be involved in a system where each
lodger would be sued at the end of each monthly 02’ bimonthly
payment and as I say, again, confessing the validity of the
point of not making the benefit available in the first
’instance.

No, your» Honor, because —

Because ~

You said if the lodger goes, the money

goes back.
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

I —

You are giving

$100 for shelter and

the lodger comes in and you say, well, we are going to out
it to $80 and the recipient says, uh uh, I can’t stand that.
Get out, lodger.
Then you go back to the $100.
And the only thing that has been accomplished is
the lodger ha3 been thrown out in the cold, cold world.
MS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Well —

Am I right?

MRS. GORDON:

Just like the rest of us, your

Honor, to provide for his own shelter needs.
Now, your Honor, I am afraid that there are two
inherent defects in that line of reasoning.
First, it assumes that there is something which
Appellees like to characterize as a full shelter allowance
or a full grant.

There is no such thing in the New York

system as a full shelter allowance.
There is only a shelter allowance to meet each
individual need,

Now, it may be —

30
QUESTION:

Well, Is that $100 In my case?

MRS. GORDON:

That would be $100 In your case,

your Honor, if. for example, there were four recipients and
their pro rata shares of the allowed rent were $25 each.
All right?
QUESTION:

So that would be $100.
You'd say $100.

MRS. GORDON:

Now, let’s assume, for example, that

at the time their needs were budgeted, there were three
recipients and a lodger.

Their original grant would be, let's

say, on your example, $75.
QUESTION:

Right?

Mine was $100 and three recipients and

nobody else.
MRS. GORDON:

On my example, your Honor, there are

now four recipients —
QUESTION:

Will you first answer mine?

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, your Honor, I --

You have got three recipients.

They

have made a minimum requirement to you, for your three of
you, is $100 a month.
Next month, lodger moves in.
They don’t say, your requirement has dropped.

They

say, oh, lodger has moved in.
So without more, it is dropped to $80.

And then

lodger moves out and leaves the three recipients there.
goes back to $100.

It

QUESTION:

Well, I take It one possible answer Is

that with the lodger In, the people are still living and
they have proved by their behavior that the3v don’t need as
much as they did before.
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

No, that is not the answer.

Well, what is the answer?

MRS. GORDON:

I think perhaps if I can clarify

my response to Justice Marshall.

First of all, in New

York, your Honor, there is no such thing as a minimum for
three.

There is only your proportion — you are either a

lodger or a nonrecipient individual -- your proportion of
the allowed rent which we pointed out is largely the actual
rent which is also a maximum, not a minimum and a ceiling
on the amount of payment, not what any one individual or
any one — any group of individuals is entitled to.
~he rneasure
the dwelling.

anyone's need is his proportion of

Now, if you have three recipients in a

dwelling, your Honor, and the total dwelling costs $100 a
month, each recipient, in effect, gets a third.
Now, Appellees say on that point that that Is not
true.

Appellants are wrong because they only made one

payment.
Now, it is true that in some circumstances we make
one payment.
For example, an AFDC

caretaker and her minor

32

children get one payment because she is the person of
majority and they are all minors.
So therefore when we say, in your example, the
third, they each get a third.
Now, that third also reflects their beneficial use
of the dx-relling, right?
'

In thirds.

Mow, we add somebody else, your Honor.

Then vie

have fourths because we have four people using the dwelling
but the costs didn't increase.
In short, the needs of the fourth Individual were
met in the same space, Mr. Justice White —
QUESTION:

But the trouble is, in your houses, you

don't add on rooms.
MRS. GORDON:

four —

MRS, GORDON:

You can't put —

So you gave $100 and when all four

moved in
MRS. GORDON:

Your Honor, we didn’t give $100.

We gave —
QUESTION:

The reason you gave $100 was because

you couldn't get It any cheaper, that’s why you gave $100.
MRS. GORDON:

That’s right, your Honor.

You

could ..perhaps —
QUESTION:

That’s why you gave $100.

MRS. GORDON:

Perhaps so.

You could not get that

apartment for any cheaper and while three individuals were
in it, each was allocable one-third of the cost.
Now, since — as, in fact, one of the Appellees’
witnesses below testified in evidentiary hearing, people
are not mechanical toys, the same apartment that accommodates
three may very well accommodate four and when that fourth
person comes in, nis need for shelter is being met and the
question is then presented, should we allocate to him a
share of costs?
.it

we do not allocate to him a share of costs,

your Honor, we are operating under a totally different
system than the one that New York operates under, namely a
flat grant.
In addition, if we say, under the present system
that the addition of an Individual does not diminish shelter

34
needs then we are making one of at least several irrebuttable
presumptions x?hich are far more detrimental to the program
and, indeed, to the individual recipients* welfare.
QUESTION:

Do you also cut down the food allowance

when he eats?
MRS. GORDON:

Absolutely not, your Honor.

We do

not cut down the food allowance, because —
QUESTION:

So if he lives next door and came In

there and ate three meals a day, that Is fine.
MRS. GORDON:

No, that Is not fine, your Honor,

because that would be —• as an example that Justice White
gave, probably a diversion of grants for the benefit of
another for which various civil remedies could be applied to
the woman for which various criminal remedies could be
applied to the woman and which, Indeed, ultimately — perhaps
the ultimate sanction —
QUESTION:

You mean, It Is a crime to give somebody

a meal?
MRS. GORDON:

No, It is not a crime to give somebody

a meal, your Honor, but If you had a continuing pattern of
behavior wherein a caretaker-relative were devoling substan­
tial amounts of the resources provided for herself and her
child to another, obviously, that is a diversion of the
grant and there is a criminal penalty for that.
However, obviously, we do not enforce it in single

instances where there is no harm to the child.
That is exactly what I was trying to say and,
indeed, perhaps the most severe sanction in the entire
program is that if the woman neglects the child by
diverting the resources on a persistent basis we ultimately
have the power to remove the child but obviously this does
not work in the lodger situation because we are taling about
a big shelter allowance allocable among a certain number of
individuals.
I have reserved some rebuttal time and I will
close now.
Thank you, your Honors.
QUESTION:

Mr3. Gordon, what if there were a

situation where the mother and children occupied a couple
of bedrooms and a lodger moved in and the social services
people determined that was just one too many people in the
house to be helpful.
Would they have the authority to a3k the person
who owned or rented the place to make the lodger move out?
MRS. GORDON:
ask for her to do that.

Yes, they would have authority to

I do not think, particularly in

view of the Appellees’ associational and privacy claims they
could compel her to do that.
As I say, the ultimate sanction for the vrorrian who
does not properly protect the interests of her children is,

36
of courses the removal of the children and determination of
her status as a caret alter-relative, If she does what you say»
Wow, one of the difficulties involved in what you
say and, in fact, one of the benefits of the operation of
the regulation is, in common sense, if you have a lodger who
has money or if you have a lodger who applies for assistance»
in other words, gets the means to support himself or is
willing to apply those means, he then, in terms of his payment,
can pay a share of a larger apartment to accommodate the
combined group or he can — If it is assistance he obtains by
virtue of his getting on assistance. In effect, the right to
a larger apartment to accommodate the combined group.
But if he chooses to refuse to pay anything, he
refuses to get assistance to live, in effect, off the grant
of the recipient and the children who are the only indivi­
duals before the Agency, then the choice — their choice
results In the situation you described and our alternative is
ultimately, after exhausting our various lesser remedies, to
remove the children or possibly prosecute the mother for
"neglect.’
Thank you.

37
ORAL ARGUMENT OP MARTIN A. SCHWARTS, ESQ.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In 1968,this Court in Kina versus Smith, held
that the Social Security Act prohibited the State of
Alabama from denying needy and dependent children of APDC
assistance because the caretaker-relative associated with a
person who had no legal obligation to support the children
and who, in fact, provided no support.
This Court held that the Alabama substitute
parent rule, in effect, defined the term "parent" in a
manner that consisted with Section 606A of the Social
Security Act and left Alabama’s needy and dependent
children without meaningful protection.
The New York lodger, the

so-called "lodger”

has the same relevant characteristics as Alabama’s
substitute parent.

He is also a person who has no legal

obligation to support the family.

He is also a person who

has, In fact, provided no support.
Both the Alabama rule and the New

York rule

operate without regard to the family's actual needs.
The only difference between the substitute parent
rule in King versus Smith and the New York lodger rule is
that, whereas Alabama completely denied APDC children APDC
assistance, the New York rule works a reduction in the APDC

38
grant because the caretaker-relative has chosen to allow
another person to reside In the home.
We submit that this Court, In King versus Smith,
did not imply —• and we submit did not intend that needy and
dependent children can be denied part of their APDC assistance
based upon the fiction that their needs have diminished
because the caretaker-relative associates with the person who
has the same characteristics as the substitute parent in
King versus Smith.
QUESTION:

But on the other hand, if, in Mr. Justice

Rehnquist’s example, mother and children are occupying two
bedrooms and mother’3 sister moves in with them and the
children move in with the mother and the sister occupies the
bedroom, I suppose the children aren’t really enjoying the
space they used to enjoy.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think that if New York had a rule

that wa3 based upon an assessment of the space needed for
the -family and if —
QUESTION:

Well, but the fact is that — the fact

is that the lodger is being — his — the space he occupies
is being paid for by the state.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well,

I have to disagree with that

characterization, your Honor when I say that —
QUESTION:

Well, he isn’t paying for it.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

He is not paying —

39
QUESTION;

Somebody Is.

MR. SCHWARTZ;

He is nob paying for it but the

state, when it initially computes the family shelter
allowance, has

computed the amount of shelter allowance

that the state itself has determined is necessary to meet
the needs of the AFDC family.
QUESTION;

Well, that may be so but that space

that is necessary Is no longer being used by the children —

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

But —

Because the lodger Is using it ana

whatever the state has computed as being needed by the
child isn’t being used any more.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, I think it is clear ——

Well, isn’t that so or not?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That Is so by definition.

Of

course, It is not so — we cannot assume that the lodger is
using a pro rata share of the apartment.

He may be

as

Judge Oakes pointed out in the Court of Appeals, he may be
sleeping in the hallway, he may be sharing a bed in another
room.
QUESTION:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

Well, wherever he is, the three members

of the family can’t be.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
with that.

Well, I could have no quarrel

40

QUESTION:

Well, I would hope not,

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That the state, however, may not

reduce the AFDC grant solely because the caretaker-relative
has invited, another person into the home is substantiated
both by the regulation of the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, which was promulgated subsequent to this
Court’s decision in King and was designed to implement the
decision in King and that regulation is now Section 233.90(A)
of the Code of Federal Rules and Regulations, Title 45 and,
secondly, by this Court’s decision in Lewis versus Martin,
which upheld the validity of this HEW regulation.
Now, this regulation in essence provides that the
inclusion in the AFDC family or the presence in the home of
any person other than a person who has a legal obligation to
support the AFDC family is, in the words of the regulation,
not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility, which
would be basically a codification of the holding in King.
The regulation goes on, or for assuming the
availability of income by the state.
I submit that this regulation was designed to
ensure that needy and dependent children are not denied and
do not receive a reduced grant of assistance solely because
the caretaker role relative has Invited a person without a
legal obligation of support into the home.
Inueed, this Court's decision in Lewis versus

41
Martin makes it clear that the state cannot reduce the
grant even where the person residing In the home has some
legal obligation of supports but where this legal obliga­
tion is something less than that of a natural parent and,
secondly, even where the person residing In the home has
available income.
So we submit that what New York is attempting to
do here is to accomplish by the double assumption that A}5
the so-called "lodger" has available income and B), he is
applying the assumed available income to meet the family’s
needs, even though Lewis versus Martin, in Section 233-90
would prohibit the state from even assuming

that income

which the lodger, in fact, has is available to meat the
family's needs.
I think it is clear that the regulations, in
fact, are based upon the assumption that the so-called
"lodger" is paying his share of the rent.
First of all, the lodger regulations themselves
are, on their face, state that the available income and
resources of the so-called "lodger" shall be applied in
accordance with — and then comes the rest of the proration
grant.
And in addition, the lodger regulations on their
face deem the person residing in the home to be a lodger
and the term "lodger," I submit, connotes a person who is

42
paying his part of the rent.
In addition, I think the operation of the regulations
substantiate that they are based on the assumption that the
lodger is paying his part of the rent.

The family's rental

obligation is, of course, fixed initially by its agreement
with the landlord

and the Defendants themselves compute the

family's shelter allowance in a manner that is designed to
reflect and meet the shelter needs of the APDC family unit
which, in most cases, would mean a shelter allowance
sufficient to meet its actual rental obligation,
Now, these shelter needs and rental obligations
do not automatically decrease, of course,

by the fact that a

caretaker-relative has invited another person to reside in
the home.
They would only decrease if the person invited in­
to the home, in fact, pays part of the rent.

But 1 submit

that it is this assumption of payment by the lodger which is
the very assumption of payment which Is prohibited by this
Court's decision in Lewis versus Martin arid by Section 233.90,
In response to Mr, Justice Stewart’s question.
Mew fork in fact, as one of Its predecessor regulations to
the present lodger regulation had a regulation that clearly
conflicted with Lewis versus Martin and it is set out in full
in our brief at page 43,
i will not take the time of the Court to read that.

The reduction in the grant is not based upon any
assessment by the state that the family shelter needs have
decreased and I think this is brought out by the dialog
between Mr. Justice Marshall and my adversary and it is
clear that if the lodger moves out of the home the full
shelter allowance would be restored.
In addition, if the family moved to a smaller
apartment, no matter how small this new apartment if as, no
matter how low the rent was in the second apartment, the
defendants would continue to provide a prorated share of
the rent and

I think this is made clear by the factual

situation of one of the applicants

for interventions

Loretta Clark.
Now, she lives with her five children so that is
a family of six and their rental expense and obligation is
$75 per month which is certainly, I think, a minimal amount
for a family of six but because Mrs. Clark has invited
another person to reside in the Clark household, the state
continues to provide a reduced amount to meet their shelter
needs.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schwartz?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

Do you agree that this person is

getting shelter paid for by the state?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

QUESTION:

Well, is It true or not?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, the state has paid for the rent

and he is living there.

So he is getting a bounty from the

Is that

Well* since I can't get an answer to

its assuming that the state is paying it and assuming that
he is — the lodger, he or she

is getting the benefit of

the state money without the state’s permission, what can.
the state do about it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, I submit ~

With you, I’d have to say what. If

anything, can the state do?
[Laughter.3
MR. SCHWARTZ:

First, If the lodger were a

relative — which Is one possibility, for example.

It is

reflected In the Taylor situation and it is also reflected
in the otey situation, the State of New York — I believe
it would be within its police powers as the State of
California In Lewis versus Martin, to enact a statute which
would provide for an obligation of support by that relative.
That is one possibility.
QUESTION:

One possibility.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Now, I think the question Is more

difficult if the person is a nonrelative.

Now, the

46
possibility arises that the state may be able to proceed
against the lodger to collect part of the rent.

Of course, that —
QUESTION:

How?

I assume the lodger doesn’t have

any money.
MR. SCHWARTS:

I am only, of course, hypothesising.

The state could possibly — I am not conceding -QUESTION:

The state might get its money back.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I am not conceding the validity of

such a statute but I am saying —
QUESTION:

Well, when you do that, aren’t you

conceding that the state has a right to get that money?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I am not making that concession.

I

am -- I am just —
QUESTION:

I’m just wondering.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I am just looking at the state

possibilities but I think that under the money payment
principle, once the state provides a grant to the public
assistance family, the money payment principle guarantees
that family freedom of choice in expending their grant up
to the point, I would say, that the children are being
harmed.
I think It also has to be realised that the person
in the home in King versus Smith and Lewis versus Martin
were also getting those benefits and conforta that anyone who

47
may reside in the home of another would receive but this
Court held that the purposes of the Social Security Act
which are designed to protect the children and to prevent
harm to the children would override any incidental free
ride, which I suppose I would have to concede that this
lodger is obtaining., but I submit it is the same free ride
that the person in the home in King versus Smith and Lewis
versus Martin was receiving.
QUESTION:

Well, the state says that that applied

only to men.
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

The King case applied only to men.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, the case of Klnp; versus

Smith is — relates not so much to the technical use of the
term "parent" in section 606A, even though that was the
precise holding of the Court, but to the question of
whether the children were deprived of parental support and
I think that was really the key issue and of course in
Lewis versus Martin, the State of California was saying
essentially the same thing that the State of New York is
saying here.
They were saying that since this man is residing
in the home, this man should take on the obligation of
supporting the children.
QUESTION:

He is getting the

benefits of —

Yes, but he should take on the

48
obligation of paying for his lodging, his own lodging, that
is what it

3ays.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, but I am saying it is a very

similar theory to the theory that the State of California ~
QUESTION:

It had nothing to do with the support

of the children, as I understand the theory behind this law.
It Just says that his share of the shelter is attributable
"to him.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I recognize the differences.

I am

Just saying that the State of California was saying something
similar.

It was saying you are here residing in the home.

You are getting" the benefit from being part of the family.
Therefore, because of those instances, you should
take on an obligation to provide support for the family up
to the amount of your available income.
•

In this case, New York is saying because the

lodger is in the home, he is getting benefits in the home,
the lodger should pay his share of the rent but1 I submit this
assumption

<pf payment is specifically prohibited by the

Social Security Act Section 602A(7) and certainly by Section
233.90 of the HEW regulation.
On the constitutional issue, the lodger regulations
also create a conclusive presumption in violation of the due
process clause that whenever there is a lodger in the home,
this person is able to and is in fact paying a prorata share

of the family’s rental obligation.
The regulations work substantial takings of
property in the forms of substantial reductions in the
family's public assistance grant and therefore come within
the purview of the due process clause.
This Court's recent decisions hold that it
violates the due process clause for the state to work a
taking of property on the basis of conclusively presumed
facts when the conclusively-presumed facts are of the type
that the state statutory scheme purports to be concerned
with.
Here, the New York statutory scheme purports to
meet 100 percent of the needs of all of its recipients.

It

purports to meet the full shelter obligation of all of its
recipients.

It purports to be concerned with the actual

needs, the actual resources, the actual Income of each of
its recipients and, indeed, the lodger regulations them­
selves, on their face, purport to be concerned with the
lodger's available Income and resources which may, in fact,
not even exist and with actual contributions by the lodger.
QUESTION:

Assume the state calculated how much a

family of four needed for food and It was $100 a month and
they give them $100 a month and then the family moves in a
so-called "lodger" or relative and be lives off the $100
along with the other four.

Now, he is eating part of the

50
food.

Now., is there anything the state can do about that?
HR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think they can.

What can they do?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

All right, first of all, I think

what they can do is reflected in this Court’s decision in
Wyman versus James,

I mean, the whole purpose of the state

welfare visit is to provide a safeguard against this type of
abuse.
QUESTION:

Well,, the facts are perfectly clear and

the recipient, or the APDC recipient says, well, of course,
the fifth person is living here and he is a relative of mine
and I intend to keep him and we can all live on the $100 a
month, it’s just that we are not eating as well as we did.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Right, as I said, under Wyman versus
James is a possibility of casework services that prevent
this type of divestiture of the grant from continuing.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the recipient just

says, go about your'own business.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Right,

1511 go about mine.
Right.

Now, of course, this

Court in Wyman versus James said that the recipient cannot
make that assertion.

At least, the recipient cannot say

— of the right to privacy and

However, the state could make restricted

payments or provide voucher payments to the family.
In other words, if there was a problem as to
whether the rental allowance was, in fact, being met to
meet the rental needs, the state could make a direct payment
to the landlord.
This is provided by federal regulations and state
regulations.
QUESTION:

Well, I know but — in my example,

xtfhatever food comes into the house, five people now share
Instead of four.

Now, x?hat can the state do about it?

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, this is —

And all the food —•

MR. SCHWARTZ:

— an assumption.

Of course, this?

is nothing in the reoord in the instant case and there is
nothing in the instant ease that indicates that these socalled "lodgers" are obtaining their food and clothing from
the grant of the —
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand that.

I understand

52
that.

But they are sharing the space.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

They are sharing the space.

Despite the state’s concern with meeting the actual
needs of each of its recipients, the grant is reduced
automatically solely because the caretaker-relative has
allowed another person to reside in the home.

I submit that

the state can rationally make case-by-case determinations of
whether this lodger has, in fact, made a contribution —
indeed, made case-by-case determinations whether the family
has any excessive space and making these case-by-ease
determinations would not impose a great burden on the state
in view of the fact that the state already makes its fair
hearing procedure available in all cases of proposed
reductions in the public assistance grant.
QUESTION:

What if they decided that the family

didn’t have any excessive space, «Just without the lodger and
that the lodger was one too many?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

The example that they did have

extra —?
QUESTION:

No, that they did not.

MR. SCHWARTS:
QUESTION:

That they were overcrowded.

Yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

If they — I 'would concede that if

the state determined that the family was residing in over­
crowded quarters that perhaps the state could take steps to

compel the lodger to leave.
QUESTION:

I say that because —

Well, It could if your example that

the state could proceed In a case-by-case basis means
anything.

Presumably if the state found the facts in the

individual case9 they would have to be —
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, I agree.

I think the interests

of the children are paramount throughout the entire AFDC
program and any rights that the caretaker-relative might
have in relationship to an association with a lodger would
have to give way to the welfare of the children.
QUESTION:

Well, what could the state do, though?

You say they could — how could they move him out?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I would concede that in that

instance any rights of privacy and association that the
caretaker-relative has would give way —
QUESTION:

Well, I know they would give v?ay but

what could the state, as a practical matter, do?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think in that instance that the

state could Insist that the lodger leave the home.
QUESTION:

Well, I know they insist, they go down

and insist but If the person says, sorry, this is my
business.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It may ultimately result in a

direct proceeding having to be brought against the parent.
I mean, this remedy Is available.

QUESTION:

Is that the ultimate?

about all the state could do?

Is that just

You don’t think they could

cut the aid off» do you?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I don’t think cutting the aid off

would solve the problem.

If the family is living in overly-

crowded quarters in accordance with the examples given by
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is not going to solve the problem
to provide the family with the reduced public assistance
allowance.
It seems to me that that Is only going to cause
further ham to the family.

It is not a means of tackling

the problem.
Our claim under the —
QUESTION:

Well, then, you really go back to what

Mr. Justice White suggested, that all they can do is — the
state can do is initiate a proceedings to take the children
away from the mother.

Well, as I say, there are steps

QUESTION:

The possibility of casework

There are intermediate steps,
All to the end of persuading the lodger

to get out.
MR, SCHWARTZ:

In a case where the children are

being hurt, and only then.
QUESTION:

And if he doesn’t get out, then the

E>5

state is left only with the procedure for taking the
children from their mother,
MR, SCHWARTS:

1 would say in a ease where the

parent is doing something that is causing harm to the
children that a neglect proceeding may well have to be the
ultimate remedy.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest the state would be

enabled to bring an eviction proceeding against the lodger?
MR, SCHWARTS:

Well, the state would have no

standing under New York .State law to bring an eviction
proceedings, only the —
QUESTION:

What if these mediation efforts that

Mr. Justice White was asking you about failed?

What is the

ultimate?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, as I say, if they failed,

the Department of Social Services may well have to bring
in the neglect proceeding.

It would be brought in New York

family court and of course the New York family court has
wide discretionary powers.
QUESTION:

It would be brought against whom?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

It W5uld be brought against the

parent, against the caretaker-relative.
QUESTION:

And then the State of Hew York wSLI

have to do something about supplying a lawyer for the -“?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, the Department of Social

55
Services in New York routinely, unfortunately, in a social
sense, has to bring neglect proceedings in Mew York family
court.
QUESTION:

Well, do they have to supply an attorney

for the lodger, also, to defend his rights?
MR, SCHWARTZ:

Well, under state law, there is a

statutory right of assigned counsel.

I believe it is Section

18(B) of the judiciary law.
QUESTION:

Is that lodger party to this?

MR, SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

No, the lodger would not be a party.

Well —

MR, SCHWARTZ:

I’m sorry, If the question was

whether the lodger had a right to an attorney —
QUESTION:

Yes, I should think the lodger —

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

The lodger would not be a party —

On your definition, the lodger is some

sort of a third-party beneficiary here and if his rights
are being attacked by someone, he probably would claim the
right to counsel, wouldn’t he?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I don’t believe that the

lodger would be a proper party in the neglect proceeding.
don’t

I

think he has any interest in the issues relating to

the welfare of the child which are the proper subject of the
determination between the state and the caretaker—relative
as determined by the family court.

I do not believe that the 'lodger would be a party
to that proceeding.
I misunderstood your prior question.

The New York

law iss under Section 18(b) of the judiciary law and as
established by the New York Court of Appeals' decision in
Matter of Ella B.. there is a constitutional right to
assigned counsel that the mother has in a neglect proceed­
ing, not the lodger.
Finally, our equal protection claim boils down
what
to the fact that/the lodger regulations do is to create
two classes of equally needy families.
One class consists of families in which all the
persons in the home are recipients of public assistance.
Tiie second class of families consists of families In vrtiich
the caretaker-relative has invited a non-legally-responsible
person fco reside in the home and solely because the care­
taker relative has invited a non-legally-responsible person
to reside in the home and solely because the caretakerrelative has invited the so-called "lodger" into the home,
the second, class of families receives a reduced shelter
allowance and receives a shelter allowance which is
insufficient to meet the actual shelter needs and rental
obligations of the family.
Now, we contend that the caretaker-relative's
decision or choice to invite the lodger into the home is

58
constitutionally-protected by the related rights of privacy
and association in the home.
These rights have been recognized by such decisions
of this

Court as Griswold versus Connecticut and Elsenstadt

versus Baird, which create a zone of privacy in the home.
The lodger regulations penalize the family and
the caretaker-relative for exercising this right by reducing
the allowance solely because the caretaker-relative has
Invited another person to reside in the home.
We submit that the state does not have a compelling
interest to Justify the infringement of the right to
privacy and association that could reasonably accomplish its
interest by making case-by-oase determinations of whether the
lodger has* in fact, made a contribution, whether the family,
in fact, has excess space.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEP' JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Schwartz.

The case is submitted.
