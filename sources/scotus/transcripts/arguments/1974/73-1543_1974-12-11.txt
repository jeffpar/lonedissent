MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1543, Johnson against Railway Express Agency.
Mrs. Greenberg, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. DEBORAH M. GREENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. GREENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

The

writ was directed to the question of whether the timely
filing of a charge of employment discrimination with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission tolls the running
of the statute of limitations applicable to an action based
on the same facts brought under Section 1981,
Petitioner, Willie Johnson, Jr., a black man, was
hired by REA Express in 1964.

In 1967 he filed with the

EEOC a charge of racial discrimination against REA and two
Locals of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.
He charged REA with discriminatory job assignments,
and the Locals with being racially segregated.
Three weeks later, REA fired petitioner.

Petitioner

then amended his EEOC charge to include discriminatory
discharge.

4
Respondente were given notice of the charges in
September 1967.
An EEOC investigation substantiated petitioner's
charge and in March 1970 the EEOC issued a determination
finding reasonable cause to believe that respondents had
violated Title VII.
After efforts at conciliation failed,, on January 4,
1971, petitioner received from the EEOC his notice of right
to sue, on January 15, 1971.
When he was unable to obtain private counsel,
the District Court appointed counsel to represent him, and
permitted him to file his right to sue letter as a complaint
on a pauper’s oath.
On March 18, 1971, the court-appointed attorney
filed a supplemental complaint, alleging violation of both
Title VII and section 1981.
Respondents filed motions to dismiss or for
summary judgment, with supporting affidavits and memoranda
of law.
Petitioner's court-appointed attorney filed no
papers in opposition.

The court dismissed all claims under

section 1981 as barred by the Tennessee one-year statute of
limitations on actions for compensatory or punitive
damages brought under federal civil rights statutes.
On a record which contained undisputed evidence of

5
the maintenance of segregated Locals and higher membership
dues for blacks, the court granted summary judgment to the
unions, on the grounds that plaintiffs had, quote, "no grounds
for relief under Title VII”, close quote.
And granted partial summary judgment to REA on the
issue of the lack of supervisory training.
The issues that remained in the case were claims
under Title VII against REA for discriminatory job assignment,
referral to segregated Locals, discriminatory application of
seniority rules, discriminatory discharge and discriminatory
disciplinary action.
The case was set for trial and REA took discovery
and filed a pretrial memorandum, as required by the local
rules of court.
Petitioner's court-appointed attorney did nothing.
TEA then offered petitioner a settlement of $150,
and when petitioner refused this offer, his court-appointed
counsel filed a motion to withdraw.
The court clerk advised petitioner, by letter, that
the motion, of which petitioner had received no notice, had
been granted and that if petitioner did not obtain another
lawyer within thirty days his case would be dismissed.
Petitioner went to the local Legal Aid Society, to
the Bar Association Referral Service and to two private
attorneys, to whom he was referred by the EEOC.

6

All to no avail.
Finally» he went to a Memphis lav; firm and explained
his plight tc William Caldwell.
I should explain at this point that v/hen petitioner
first received his right to sue letter he went to the same
firm and they were unable to take his case because of the
great number of Title VII cases to which the court had
appointed them.
Caldwell wrote to the Chief Judge of the District
Court» stating that he was attempting to obtain support for
the suit, and requesting an additional thirty days to obtain
counsel.
But just the day before, on February 16, 1972» an
order had been entered dismissing petitioner's case without
prejudice.
On May 5th, Caldwell again wrote the Chief Judge,
indicating that the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund had agreed to pay the costs of litigation, entering an
appearance, and requesting that the order of dismissal be
vacated.
The Chief Judge wrote back suggesting that it would
be appropriate for Caldwell to file a new action.
On May 31» Caldwell filed a new complaint,
under both Title VII and Section 1981, reiterating
petitioner's original allegations.

7
The District Court dismissed the complaint on
several grounds.
First, with respect to petitioner's Title VII claims,
he held that the interlocutory order of June 14, 1971, in the
first action, granting summary judgment to respondent

Locals

and partial summary judgment to REA, was a final judgment
constituting res judicata.
Second, that petitioner's claims under Section 1981
were barred by Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations
and also barred because of petitioner’s failure to exhaust
remedies under the Railway Labor Act.
Third, he held that petitioner's Title VII action
against REA was barred by his failure to refile within thirty
days after the dismissal without prejudice.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, disposing of the
case on timeliness grounds.

It held that the Title VII action

was barred because the second action was filed more than
thirty days after the dismissal of the first action, and
held that the statute of limitations on petitioner's 1981
action was not tolled by the filing of his EEOC charge.
Reheeiring was denied.
QUESTION;

Are you going to tell us a little bit

about what administrative remedies were available, if any, under
the Railway Act?

Or do you —

MRS. GREENBERG:

No, Your Honor, that —

3

QUESTION; — take the position that isn't a real,
genuine, meaningful remedy?
MRS. GREENBERG;

We would take the position that

there are independent remedies under Section 1981 and Title
VII, we, in our Petition for Certiorari, asked the Court to
review

the holding that petitioner,should have exhausted

his remedies under the Railway Labor Act, and the Court did
not agree to review that question.
Petitioner, and the United States as amicus
curiae, urged the Court to adopt the rule of the Fifth and
D.C. Circuits? namely, that the filing of an EEOC charge
operates to toll the running of the statute of limitations
on an action based on the same facts brought under Section
1981.
If such a rule is applied to the case at bar,
petitioner's Section 1981 action was timely filed under
Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations.
He filed his charge with the EEOC on May 31, 1967,
while still employed by REA.

The discriminatory acts

alleged therein were continuing in nature, so that none of
the one-year period had run prior to said filing.
He received his notice of right to sue on January
15, 1971.
The supplemental complaint in the first action —
and that was the first pleading to state a cause of action

9

under Section 1981 — was filed 62 days later, on March 18,
1971.
So, to that point, only 62 days had run, if the
tolling rule is adopted.
The statute stopped running when the action was
filed, and did not start running again until February 16,
1972, when the action was dismissed without prejudice.
The second action was filed 105 days after the
dismissal of the first action, on May 31, 1972.

Thus, a total

of 167 days of the Tennessee one-year .statute had run.
The purposes underlying the statute of limitations,
notice to the defendants, and the barring of stale claims
by a plaintiff who has slept on his rights, were served by
the filing of petitioner's EEOC charge.
In Burnett vs. New York Central, this Court suggested
that the basic inquiry is whether congressional purpose would
be effectuated by tolling the statute of limitations in the
circumstances of this case.
As this Court recognized in Alexander v. GardnerDenver, it is clear from the legislative history of Title VII
that Congress intended that an individual be able to pursue
his rights to be free from racial discrimination in employment
under both Title VII and Section 1981.
It is equally clear that Congress preferred the
process of fact-finding and conciliation provided in Title VII,

10

and hoped that litigation would be resorted to only if this
process was not effective.
Both policies can be accommodated by adopting the
tolling rule urged by petitioner.

Bringing suit under

Section 1981 is, of course, simpler than bringing suit
under Title VII, as there are no administrative remedies
that must be exhausted.
Indeed, one of the grounds urged by the sponsors
of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 for rejecting
an amendment that would have made Title VII the exclusive
remedy, was that procedural requirements of Title VII may
sometimes prevent an aggrieved individual from obtaining
redress, and, in such event, he should be able to fall back
on Section 1981.
On the other hand, from the point of view of the
individual with limited resources, unable to obtain counsel,
Title VII is the better remedy.

The EEOC can investigate and

conciliate claims and can even bring suit on behalf of
complainant.
As long as a person has reason to hope that he can
get the relief he seeks by resort to the EEOC, he should
not have to go to the expense of filing suit.
As Judge Tuttle, i^riting for the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, sitting en banc in Kessler vs. EEOC, said,
competent lawyers are not eager to enter the fray in behalf

11
of a person who is seesking redress under Title VII.

This

is true even though provision is made for payment of
attorney's fees, in the event of success.
Therefore, he held, the reasources of the EEOC,
such as their investigatory files, should be made available
to the private litigant, to make it less difficult for him
to bring his case to'court.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Greenberg, —

MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes?

— are you in any way restricting your

application of your theory, that is, should the tolling
effect, for instance, be limited to the charges raised in the
EEOC complaint, or shopld it be wide open?
MRS. GREENBERG:

I think tolling effect should be

limited to the same extent that they would be limited in a
Title VII case.

That is, under the standard of Sanchez vs.

Standard Brands, to the facts that would be likely to grow
out of an investigation of the EEOC charge.
QUESTION:

Would it have been possible for Mr.

Johnson to have filed his 1981 action before the period of
limitation expired, and then just kind of sit on it?

He5d

have to have approval of the court, I suppose.
MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes, that would have been possible,

but we see no reason for burdening the court calendars with
cases which are going to be sat on.

12

QUESTION:

What if it takes, as it does with some

of the agencies, Mrs. Greenberg —* I won!t mention any
particular agency; but soma of them take four or five years
or more.

Does that give you any problems?
MRS. GREENBERG:

This is a problem.

It is a

problem that has been raised in respondents? principal
argument, is that almost four years passed between the filing
of the EEOC charge and the receipt of petitioner's notice of
right to sue.
And the point that respondents make is that
allowing petitioner to file an action after such a long
period would work an injustice on the respondents.
But Congress must have intended that aggrieved
employees could take advantage of all of the investigative
and conciliatory processes of the EEOC, otherwise they could
have required —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there

right after lunch.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

13

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:01 p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Greenberg, you have

about 15, 16 minutes left.
MRS. GREENBERG:

Thank you.

Before recess, I was responding to a question of
the Chief Justice as to the problem of delay.
Congress must have intended that aggrieved
employees could take advantage of all the investigative
and conciliatory processes of the EEOC, even though that
might mean not filing a civil action under Title VII for
several years.

The legislative history is replete with

material about the backlog in the EEOC.

Congress could have

required the EEOC to issue right to sue letters within a
specified time after the filing of a charge.
It put in all kinds of short limitations on times
for doing certain things, but did not put in a limitation on
how long a matter could be before the EEOC.
QUESTION:

Now, are you arguing that the commencement

of the first action itself tolled the statutes?
MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

I think that the commence­

ment of an action —
QUESTION:

Is that question here?

That's the

problem that's been giving me some trouble.
MRS. GREENBERG:

That question is not here.

We

14
would argue that, just as a matter of common sense, that a
statute of limitations on the commencement of an action would
have to stop running with the commencement of the action.
QUESTION:

Well, if you were arguing to sustain

the judgment of the court, you could use any argument you
wanted, probably, or almost any argument.

I'm having a

little trouble with that one.
MRS. GREENBERG:

Well, we could further argue

that even if the commencement of the first action did not
toll the running of the statute on the time for filing that
action, that the second action was brought within a year
after dismissal of the first action, as allowed by the
Tennessee saving statute, which provides for bringing — in
the case of any action, dismissed without a determination on
the merits, it can be filed within a year.
Affirmance of the decision below would not only
do violence to congressional policy with respect to
preserving a petitioner's right of action under 1981 and its
policy, at the same time, of encouraging resort to the
conciliatory processes of the EEOC, but would also --could also have adverse effects on the federal judicial system.
The aggrieved employee would have to file his EEOC
charge, file suit under 1981, if he could obtain counsel,
and very likely see his action come to judgment on his 1981
action before the EEOC had had a chance to investigate his

15

charge.
If he did not file suit, he would run the risk of
foregoing his rights under Section 1981 and running afoul of
the procedural requirements of Title VII, as did petitioner.
One can only speculate about the number of such
precautionary suits that might be filed.

However, the EEOC

informs us that in fiscal 1974 it received over 50,000 new
charges.
Of the charges investigated, on which decisions
were issued, 44 percent were found to be without probable
cause.
As this Court observed in Alexander vs. GardnerDenver, with respect to the conciliatory or therapeutic
processes of arbitration, the processes of the EEOC may
satisfy an employee's perceived need to resort to the judicial
forum.
This Court's recent holding in American Pipe vs.
Utah, that the avoidance of precautionary litigation is a
sound reason for tolling a statute of limitations, is equally
applicable to the instant case.
Resoondents contend in their briefs that the
principles of Burnett and American Pipe do not apply to this
case because they involved the tolling of federal not State
statutes of limitations.
This contention was squarely rejected in Holmberg

16

vs. Armbrecht, where Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated:1

It

would be too incongrous to confine a federal right within the
bare terms of a State statute of limitations unrelieved by
the settled federal equitable doctrine as to fraud, when
even a federal statute in the same terms would be given the
mitigating construction required by that doctrine.
I would like to reserve my remaining time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wisehart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR M. WISEHART, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT REA EXPRESS, INC.
MR. WISEHART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My opponent is in error in stating that the
Commission had concluded that conciliation had failed in this
case.
In actual fact, as page 75a of the record shows,
the right to sue letter was issued in response to a request
from the petitioner in this case.
employees.

The case involved ten

So far as I am informed, the Commission has never

concluded conciliation efforts, and it did not advise the
petitioner that its efforts had failed.
Which brings into play Section 29 C.F.R., section
1601.25b of the Commission's regulations.

That provision

states that when a right to sue letter has been issued at the

17
request of a complainant, then the Commission's proceedings
shall suspend.

That is the word of the regulation.

Nov/, the consequence of that, I submit, is that the
Commission’s proceedings are still in a state of suspense,
and if this Court is fed hold that Commission proceedings toll
the running of a statute of limitations under the 1866 Act,
that state of-suspense could go on for an indefinite period,
something that we entirely not contemnlated by Congress when
it passed the 1964 Act, and specified that judicial action
in these cases must begin promptly.
I simply do not see how it can be asserted that
giving effect to a tolling principle in this case would be
consistent with the will of Congress when the most recent
pronouncement of Congress on the subject has underscored the
need for fast resolution of these disputes.
The question regarding the Railway Labor Act
remedies is —
QUESTION:

I suppose it would be a simple matter to

say that the statute would have to be satisfied within the
time that the Title VII suit would have to be filed?
MR. WISEHART:

Well, that is one alternative that

may be open to this Court, but it is not open on the facts of
this case.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. WISEHART:

Because under the law of the case as

18

it stands, the time for a Title VII suit here has expired.
In all of the cases relied upon by petitioner —
QUESTION:

Well, we didn’t grant on that issue.

MR. WISEHART:

That is correct.

All of the cases

that are relied upon by petitioner are distinguishable on that
basis. There has been no case holding that the time for suing
under the 1866 Act —
QUESTION:

So that you're saying, even if your

opponents are right on the initial tolling, they are really
cut out by the fact that the Title VII suit can't be filed
now?
MR. WISEHART:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And I

believe this Court has two courses open to it. It can either
affirm the decision below on that narrow issue, and say, We're
simply not going to hold that tolling applies when it would
extend beyond the period provided by Congress in the 1964
Act —
QUESTION:
think,

So you say our limitation of grant, you

was — almost decided this case?
MR. WISEHART:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

But the Court could decide it on that narrow ground,
that we're not going to hold here that it can extend beyond
the period allowed in the 1964 Act, and reserve for another
day the question posed by Guerra v. Manchester Terminal in
the Fifth Circuit, which I understand they are going to

19

petition for certiorari on it.
They can either decide — the Court can either
decide on the narrow grounds, or it can decide on the broader
grounds, which we have briefed in this case, and that is,
that under the 1866 Act, which does have in it Section 1988,
Congress has said specifically that you must refer to State
lav/.
Now, there's no dispute in this case that for the
purpose of referring to State law you do refer to the State
statute of limitations.
The only question in this case is if, under
Section 1988, you must refer to State law for limitations
periods, whether you must also refer to State law for the
purpose of tolling.
And we submit, Your Honor, that it does not make
sense to refer to State law for one limited purpose when
tolling and statute of limitations are all part and parcel
of the same Statutory framework.
So that the cases that do not deal with the effect
of Section 1988 sidestep the issue? and the case that does deal
with that case, the best-reason case, I submit, is the case
in the Third Circuit, Ammlung v. City of Chester, which was
decided under Section 1983, another section of the 1866 Act.
And in the Ammlung case, the Third Circuit focused
specifically on the effect of 1988 and it said:

If you're

20

going to refer to the State law for the purpose of the
statute of limitations, you must also refer to the State law
for the purpose of the tolling provision.
That is -the holding in Aram lung -

The Ammlung

holding also speaks of the disarray that is found in the
Fifth Circuit cases on this subject.
cases go both ways.

The Fifth Circuit

You could cite two cases in the Fifth

Circuit in our favor, and you could cite two cases from the
Fifth Circuit in favor of petitioner.

And those are not

dispositive.
As far as the District of Columbia Circuit case
is concerned, that is dictum, because the Court found that the
alleged discrimination in that case was of a continuing nature.
Now, I would like to speak about a case that the
petitioner relies on principally, and that's the Moviecolor
case in the Second Circuit.
The Moviecolor case was an antitrust case, and in
extensive dictum, not necessary for the disposition of the
case, Judge Friendly has analyzed what is this doctrine of
federal tolling.
The decision of Judge Friendly makes it clear that
going all the way back to the case of Bailey v. Glover,
decided by this Court in 1874, 21 Wallace, the concept of
federal tolling applies (1) where there is a federal statute
of limitations — and, remember, we're talking here about an

21
admitted application of a State statute, not a federal
statute of limitations —> or, alternatively,where there is
fraud or concealment involved.

Indeed, that portion of the

Moviecclor case that is quoted on page 3 of the Reply Brief
for Petitioner makes it quite clear that Judge Friendly's
decision there is premised upon the concept of concealment.
And concealment is not in issue in this case.
More importantly than what the quotation set forth
on page 3 shows, we submit, is the language that's contained
in what was deleted from that quotation.
On page 3 of the Reply Brief, it appears that the
quotation provided by the petitioner is the beginning of a
paragraph.

But in fact the sentence that begins that

paragraph reads as follows;
In the last analysis decision of that issue —
namely, tolling —requires an attempt to divine a purpose of
Congress on a subject where no purpose has been manifested,
if indeed it was had.
Now, we submit that that language is dispositive of
this case.

Because Congress has manifested a purpose.

It

has enacted Section 1988 of the 1866 Act, in which, for
purposes of these cases reference is made to State law.
That's entirely apart from the concept of borrowings from
State statutes as a matter of comity. This is a congressional
directive.

22

When Congress passed the 1964 Act, it did not focus
upon this question, as this Court's decision in Jones v,
Mayer Company shows, the Congress did not seem to be aware
of the 1866 Act when it enacted the 1964 Act, and this
Court's opinion in the Jones case does say that therefore it
cannot be expected that the 1964 Act had any effect upon
pre-existing rights.
That's the holding of this Court.
Subsequently, Congress did focus on the existence
of the 1866 Act, partly as a result of this Court's
decision in Jones v. Mayer in 1966 and in the legislative
history of the amendments to the 1972 Act, it’s made clear
that Congress did not intend to affect existing rights
under prior legislation.

That is what the legislative

history shows.
So that we have a situation in which, as Moviecolor
points out, the purpose is to inquire into what Congress
intended. And here you have three evidences of congressional
intent.

First you have what they said in 1988 of the 1866 Act,

which is, you refer to State law.
Secondly, we have the 1964 Act and the subsequent
decision of this Court in Jones, in which it is held that
Congress did not intend to affect rights under pre-existing
legislation.
The third evidence of congressional intent is what

Congress itself provided in the Act of 1964,

And that is,

that lawsuits must be brought at an earlier time than is
possible, or is contended for, by the petitioners in this case.
The effect of the tolling which they seek in this
case would be to extend the time for lawsuits beyond that
which Congress itself provided in its most recent enactment
on this question.
And in view of those three indications of
congressional intent, and in view of the fact that the
analysis of Judge Friendly in Moviecolor shows that applica­
tion of tolling to the facts of this case which do not
involve fraud or concealment would be pushing the doctrine
farther than it has ever been pushed before.
QUESTION: Do you know of anything that would have
prevented the Congress from providing that .if an action could
be brought within six months, one year, some fixed period
after soma described cutoff point in the EEOC proceedings?
MR. WISEHART:

That is, in effect, what they did

as far as the EEO cases are concerned, under Title VII.
They must 3ue now within a specified time after the EEOC
proceeding ends under Title VII.
But Congress was silent as to —
QUESTION:

As to this?

MR. WISEHART:

— as to the effect on the 1866 Act.

Now, you had asked in an earlier question, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, about whether or not the. first case here had the
effect of tolling the action of —* under the earlier Act.
And my opponent is correct, that question has never really
been focused on here.
However, the lav? of this case, we submit, is that
the first action could not have had the effect of tolling
because the Court did instruct that further litigation be
commenced within a specified time.
And as the Court of Appeals mentioned, —
QUESTION: But you don't even get to that question.
MR. WISEHART:
QUESTION:

No, you don't.

If you’re correct, the first suit was

ian timely.
MR. WISEHART:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, but if you’re wrong on that, if

you're wrong on that and the first suit was filed in time,
wouldn’t you say that while that suit was pending, the
statute was tolled?
MR. WISEHART:

Except for the fact that it became

the lav; of the case, that further proceedings —
QUESTION:

Well, let's just assume that that first

case was still pending and had never been decided,yet the
statute is tolled while it’s pending, I suppose; isn’t it?
MR. WISEHART:
that the Court —

Your Honor, I respectfully submit

25

QUESTION: Well, it doesn’t expire and the suit
become barred while it’s pending.
MR. WISEHART:

That may be, Your Honor.

Except I

wish to draw the Court's attention to the fact that the Court
in the first suit did specify a period of time in which
further action should be brought.
QUESTION:

I understand; I understand.

MR. WISEHART:
QUESTION:

And there was no appeal from that -

Well, that's another point.

MR. WISEHART:

— as the Court of Appeals pointed

out at 107a of the record, and that that was a final decision
So that would seem to be —
QUESTION:

I understand,

MR. WISEHART:
QUESTION:
•

Well, that’s another point.

MR. WISEHART:
QUESTION:

-- res judicata on the issue.

Yes.

Yes, it is.
While it was pending the statute

was tolled.
MR. WISEHART:
QUESTION:

I think that one could infer' that.

If it was timely in the first place?

MR. WISEHART:

Yes.

Now, there was a question also on the Railway Labor
Act procedures.

The decision below was that orior resort

was required under the Railway Labor Act procedures, and
that would be dispositive of this case, even if the Court

26

should rule in petitioner's favor, because there was a
question raised, but certiorari was not granted.
Furthermore, the record indicates that this is
precisely the kind of case in which the common lav? of the
shop should be applied, and could have been applied with
respect to the petitioner, because it involved the application
of a system of demerits, a number of particular charges.
And he could have been represented in that system without
cost to himself, unless he pursued that system of industrial
justice that is provided in that way, I don't know how he
cculd establish that he had been damaged.
The reference was made to the fact that his prior
counsel had recommended settlement, which the petitioner did
not agree with.
I think that if one reads the deposition of
petitioner in this case, one can see why his prior counsel
recommended settlement, because petitioner admitted in his
deposition that because of the massive layoffs of REA,
employees with 25 years' seniority were those who could
retain jobs; and he only had seven years' seniority in 1971.
He admitted that he would have been laid off under normal
application of the company’s reduction in force system
two years before his deposition was taken.
So one can well understand why his first counsel
recommended settlement.

Thank you*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES L. HIGHSAW, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS, UNION LOCALS
MR. HIGHSAW;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The two union Local Lodges of the Brotherhood of
Railway and Airline Clerks, which I represent, find themselves
in an unusual posture in this case.
At the time the second complaint was filed, in
May 1972, which is the complaint before this Court, these
two lodges had not been in the case for a few days short of
a year.

They had been eliminated from the case the year

before by an order of the District Court, which has not been
appealed, dismissing the 1981 action on the basis of the
Tennessee State statute of limitations, and finding that on
the undisputed facts, there was no claim, valid claim by
the plaintiff against the two union Lodges, and granting
summary judgment with respect to the Title VII claim.
Consequently, when the second complaint was filed,
these two union Lodges immediately moved for a dismissal of
summary judgment on the basis of res judicata.
The District Court, with another judge sitting,
granted that motion.

We got to the Court of Appeals — that

was appealed by the petitioner, that issue.

The Court of

28

Appeals focused on the jurisdictional problem in its
original opinion, and its opinion on rehearing, the
petition on rehearing, after referring to the jurisdictional
problem, it specifically stated that the two Local Unions
had a complete defense against all claims of the petitioner
based on res judicata.
The petitioner sought cert in this

Court on that

issue, and this Court denied cert.
Now the petitioner in their brief, original brief,
and in their reply brief filed a few days ago, says this
Court should remand the res judicata issue to the Court of
Appeals.
And the amicus brief states that these two Local
Unions are asking this Court to affirm the judgment below
on this alternative ground.
Neither one of these are correct in our opinion.
Our position is that the case — when this Court denied
certiorari on the issue, that ended it.

It is a final and

binding judgment now as to these two respondents.

It's

the law of the case, and we're out of the case.
Now, I would like to address myself briefly to
the tolling issue.

I'm not going back over the ground that

Mr. Wisehart went into.

But I would like to say this:

the petitioner's case boils down simply to this:
They say that in terms of congressional intent and

29

public policy, they must have the tolling principle applied
here, because of the public policy expressed by Congress in
the conciliation process under Title VII.
And petitioner's counsel, as I understood it,
made reference to a plaintiff who had money, needed to —
and who could go ahead with 1981, still needed to file a
petition; and one who didn't have money needed to wait for
conciliation, with the EEOC.
Well, of course, the one that has the money and
wants to go ahead under 1981 can, because all he has to do
is wait 180 days and get a right to sue letter.
petitioner got a right to sue letter.
four years later.

This

He got it about

Which is the other side of the coin.

Which is, as the amicus brief says, you have to have tolling
here to let conciliation work, because they say that the
EEOC, because of its caseload, the lack of money, and its
budget and lack of staff, simply cannot get around to
conciliation.
Well, it means, and it meant in this case, that
you, as a practical matter, never have any conciliation at
all.

That's the real other side of the coin.
So when you finally get around to litigating one

of these matters, they have reached the point of being in
violation of the principles on which statutes of limitations
are based, of litigating stale claims, which is unfair to the

30

defendants.
Now, in their briefs, the petitioners say, No,
that's not so here, because, they say, the defendants will
have notice from the EEOC that there is a discrimination
problem.

So it can't get stale on them.
Well, the notice that you have after the 1972

amendments is one little sheet of paper, with a few boxes
on it.

About all it tells you i3 that there is some

discrimination.
Prior to that time you did get a notice with a copy
of the complaint, but even that didn’t give you too much
notice, because the Sanches: case and other cases that's
been cited by petitioner's counsel were so broad in permitting
Title VII complaints that had charges different than those
before the Commission, that you didn’t really get ary notice
then, either.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it that the 1981 action

is separate and apart from the Title VII suit that might
eventuate?
MR. HIGHSAW:
for jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Yes, that's an alternative basis

Yes, Your Honor.
I take it that the 1981 action will

either be completely distinct or overlap the Title VII suit.
MR. HIGHSAW:

Well, I've never seen a case that

it wasn't just the same facts.

31
QUESTION:

Well, that's what I'm — what difference

does it make whether the 1981 action survives at all?
MR. HIGHSAW:
QUESTION:

Well, —

If the Title VII suit may be brought

within time?
MR. HIGHSAW:

Well, it requires — it requires

the defendants, among other things, to be litigating these
stale issues in a situation —
QUESTION;

Well, I understand, but let's assume —

MR. HIGHSAWs
QUESTION:

Yes, yes, in this —

— let's assume that suit is timely

brought and there's two counts, one's a Title VII suit and
one's a 1981 suit? will the 1981 suit either reach substantive
matters or provide remedies that the Title VII suit will not?
MR. HIGBSAW:
usually it does not.

It can reach other matters, but

But it was —* does provide other

remedies, which can make a substantial —
QUESTION:

What's that?

MR. HIGHSAW:

I want to know.

— substantial difference to a

defendant.
QUESTION: Well, that's what I want to know. Why
do you feel threatened by a 1981 suit more than a —separately from a Title VII suit?
MR. HIGHSAW:
one very major area,

Well, punitive damages is one area,

r

32
QUESTION:

Punitive damages?

MR. HIGHSAW:

Yeah — that you feel threatened in.

There is a statute of limitations now in Title VII
that goes back two years from the time the Title VII complaint
is filed.

You can — you could go back further than that,

in the 1981, if you could go forward with the 1981.
QUESTION:

In some States.

MR. HIGHSAW:

In some States, yes.

It might be three or four years in some States.
So you would have much bigger damages, and this becomes a
matter of great concern, particularly to the Unions, where
you have these big class actions, which is what you have now
— you have hundreds of people you're talking about.
QUESTION:

Well, the filing of the EEOC complaint

at least puts you on notice that there may be, eventually, a
Title VII suit.
MR. HIGHSAW:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But there’s another —

And it also, as you said, would very

frequently involve facts that could give 1981 relief.
MR. HIGHSAW:
Honor.

There’s another aspect of it, Your

And that is you’re lucky if you get a notice from

EEOC.
The cases which we cite in our brief, the EEOC
violates the statute, they just don’t serve a notice.
the cases hold that this is not fatal.

And

33

X cited a case I’m in now.

I couldn't get the

District Court to send it back to the EEOC for conciliation.
We would have loved to conciliate it.

We never heard of the

discrimination, alleged discrimination matter until we got
served with the complaint in a federal court.
So that there's no — there?s no guarantee on the
basis of the application of the lav? that you’re even going to
get a notice from the EEOC.

And, as I say, the notice you

get doesn't show you any tiling.
paper with a box on it.

It's just a single sheet of

And you itfould have to be — you

would have to be a real wizard if you figured out exactly
what was involved in it, or what the nature of the claim was.
QUESTION:

You represent a union with quite a large

membership, I take it?
MR. HIGESAW5

Well, the union that these two

Local Lodges are in is, that's right, it's a railroad union
that has about 200,000 members.

These two Local Lodges

at that time probably had maybe 75 members.
QUESTION:

I don't know that it's relevant here, but

I wonder if you, if you know, any idea how many notices a
year, how many complaints a year are filed with EEOC
affecting the people who were your members, or are your
members?
MR. HIGHSAW:
QUESTION:

Well, —
Is it a very large number, a very small

34
number?
MR. HIGHSAW:

It's a very large number.

There's

— at one time there v/ere pending before EEOC,, and there has
never been any conciliation or anything done abou€ them,
approximately 200 complaints.
And there's a constant flov; of these complaints.
Because of the nature of the individuals that this
union represents, it has a large number of black employees
and it has a large number of women employees it represents,
and it gets substantial number of complaints in both areas.
QUESTION: And I suppose this is something fairly
common to any new mechanism of this kind?
MR. HIGHSAW:

I think that’s right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Highsaw.

Mrs. Greenberg, you have some time left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. DEBORAH M. GREENBERG,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. GREENBERG:

In response to REA's contention

that tinder the regulations petitioner's charge might still be
pending before the EEOC and therefore this — there would be
tolling forever, we are only contending that the statute of
limitations should be tolled until a notice of right to sue
is issued.
Mr. Justice White suggested the possibility of
limiting the time for charging, for bringing suit under

35

1981 to the time allowed to bring suit under Title VII.
This possibility was suggested in a footnote in the
government’s brief, citing McAllister vs. Magnolia Petroleum.
McAllister is not precedent for limiting the time
for bringing a 1981 action to the time for bringing Title VII
actions.

We are not asking the Court to fashion a time

limitation for the bringing .of 1981 actions as was done in
McAllister, but merely to determine the circumstances under
which the statute, the State statute of limitations should be
tolled.
QUESTION:

And you think it should be tolled during

the time the complaint is pending, and up until the time the
right to sue letter is issued?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And then the State statute starts

running again?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It

—

And the time begins when — not with

the complaint, begins v?ith the filing of a charge with the
Commission, doesn’t it?
MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

I'm sorry, I thought

that’s —
QUESTION:

That's when the tolling begins.

MRS. GREENBERG:
begins.

Yes, that's when the tolling

36
QUESTION:

The tolling period begins, under your

submission, from the time the *— a charge is filed with the
Commission —
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— until the issuance of a right to

sue notice by the Commission?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Correct?

MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

That's your submission.
And then it starts running again, and

it ends whenever the State law would say it ends.
QUESTION:

Right.

MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

In McAllister —
QUESTION:

What would that have been here?

MRS. GREENBERG:

When would it have ended?

Sorry, I haven’t — I haven't computed that.

I did

observe that, I think, 167 days had passed under that method
of computation; 167 out of the one year.
QUESTION:

One-year statute, right?

MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

As construed by this Court, —

MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

— the Tennessee statute of one year.

37

MRS. GREENBERGs

Yes.

Incidentally, just going back to McAllister again,
in that case the only way the Court could — the only means
that the Court could fashion to enable plaintiff to preserve
his rights under the unseaworthiness claims was by stretching
or extending the time for filing to the time allowed by the
Jones Act.

There was no event, as in this case, v/hich might

have triggered the tolling of the State statute of limita­
tions .
QUESTION;

Mrs. Greenberg, may I ask — you said

167 of the one-year period had elapsed, —
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— when the right to sue letter issued;

right?
MRS. GREENBERG:

No.

The — our contention is

that no time had elapsed before the right to sue letter was
issued, because the charge which was filed, based on
continuing violations, was filed while plaintiff was still
employed by REA.

So that —

QUESTION:

So that you mean at the time of the right

to sue letter issued there vras still a year —
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— before the 1981 suit could be brought?

QUESTION: Right.
MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

QUESTION: And was it in fact brought within that
year?
MRS. GREENBERG:

The —■ yes, the first action

was brought less than thirty days — the first Title VII
action was —
QUESTION: When was the 1981 action brought?
MRS. GREENBERG:

The 1981 — the first pleading,

which included 1981, was the supplemental charge filed by
the court-appointed attorney in the first action 62 days
after the receipt of the notice of right to sue.
QUESTION:

So it was within the year?

MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

QUESTION:

All right.

QUESTION:

And that was dismissed?

MRS. GREENBERG:

That was dismissed without

prejudice.
QUESTION:

But was that the one that said you have

to do something within — you have to refile within a certain
time?
MRS. GREENBERG:

There’s a — respondents are in

error when they 3ay that the District Court, in dismissing
the first action, provided a time within which a new action
had to be filed.

There was no such pro\'ision.

I think there is some confusion, and there was some
confusion in the Court of Appeals.

39

QUESTION: Well, the Court of — did the Court of
Appeals think so, too?
MRS. GREENBERG:

Well, it's not — it's hard to

tell, but v;hat — what the decision, what the ruling was,
that is, Judge Brown's ruling in the first action was:

if

you don't get another lawyer within thirty days your action
will be dismissed without prejudice.
QUESTION:

Yes?

MRS. GREENBERG:

l*t did not say when you could

then file a new action.
QUESTION:

So then what — why -was it, the second

Title VII suit, ever dismissed?
MRS. GREENBERG:

The second Title VII action was

dismissed because the new complaint was not filed within
thirty days after the — after the dismissal without
prejudice, on the grounds that Title VII provided a —
QUESTION:

I see.

MRS. GREENBERG:

— thirty-day statute of limita­

tions for the filing of a Title VII action.
QUESTION:

So it wasn't because they hadn't —-

that they had failed to comply with the court order?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

No.

So the rationale for dismissing the

Title VII suit, second Title VII suit was wholly inapplicable
to the 1981 action, —

40

MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— and then the time for filing it hadn't

run, and you think it should be sustained?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

No!

Oh, you think it should — you think the

[sic]
Title I action should be sustained?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, but —

hs timely.

MRS. GREENBERG:

As timely.

I think that the Title VII

action should —
QUESTION:

No, no, the 1931 action?

MRS. GREENBERG:

The 1981 action was timely, yes.

QUESTION:

Yes, unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

That's why you're here.

MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

As to the Railway Labor Act point which was first
raised by the Chief Justices

We discussed the Railway Labor

Act point at page 18 of our Petition for Certiorari.

At

that place we cite a number of cases holding -that in order
to bring a 1981 action one does not have to exhaust
procedural —
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Mrs. Greenberg, I want to

know — if I've got the chronology now:

A right to sue

issued, an initial suit was brought within thirty days, which
also included the 1981 count.

Right?

41
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION;

No.

Because —

Well, it was added; it was added.

MRS. GREENBERG:

It was added. The problem was

that the first —
QUESTION;

Right.

MRS. GREENBERG:

He couldn't get a lawyer the first

time, so the judge allowed him to —
QUESTION;

Now, what was dismissed were both

actions when finally — the first dismissal, was it?
MRS. GREENBERG:

The final dismissal, because he

couldn’t get a lawyer, —
QUESTION:

Not the final, this was an initial

dismissal, wasn't it?
MRS, GREENBERG:

There was an initial interlocutory

order dismissing the 1981 actions as not timely filed,
because of the one-year statute, not dealing with the tolling
issue at all.
And granting summary judgment to the union on their
Title VII action. And it's not clear whether that was on
procedural grounds. The motion for summary judgment was based
on procedural issues.
And graning partial summary judgment on plaintiff's
Title VII claims against REA.
QUESTION;
yoursecond action -

But when you got around to filing

42

MRS. GREENBERGs
QUESTION:

Yes.

There was a second action filed, I

take it?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION

%

Yes.

you included both 1981 and Title VII

actions?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And that one was dismissed, that one

was totally dismissed, —
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— and the Title VII was on account of

how it didn't comply with the statute of limitations in
Title VII.
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the 1981, for the same reason as

before, —
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— which you claim was wrong, just

flatly erroneous?
MRS. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

MRS. GREENBERG:

Your Honor, to just briefly get

back to the Railway Labor Act issue, and point out that
all the cases hold that, in every Circuit that has considered
it, that one does not have to exhaust the EEOC procedural

43

remedies before filing a suit voider 19 81.

I don't see any

reason why one should have to exhaust remedies under the
Railitfay Labor Act.
It has been held by the Eighth Circuit, in Norman vs.
Missouri-Pacific , that in order to file a Title VII suit one
does not have to exhaust under the Railway Labor Act.
That is the only decision we have found specifically
dealing with that, other than, of course, Glover„
I want to address myself further to the REA's
argument that one has to apply the — if one looks at the
State statute of limitations, one has to look at all of the
State laws.
This was rejected — was rejected by Mr. Justice
Frankfurter in the portion of Holmberg v. Armbrecht that I
quoted before.
Brief.

It is discussed at some length in our Reply

And it is of course discussed by Justice Friendly —

Judge Friendly, who said in Moviecolors

for some purposes

you look at the State law, for some purposes you look at
federal law.

If the concerns are federal concerns, you look

at federal law.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Greenberg, are the unions still

here in light of our limitation and denial of cert to
Question 2(c) in your petition?
MRS. GREENBERG:

Yes.

QUESTION: They still are?

44
MRS. GREENBERG:

The Circuit Court, in its

footnote, in its opinion denying rehearing, which is in the
Appendix at 115, said that the summary judgment against the
unions was res judicata.
Now, that summary judgment, which is at page —
the order granting summary judgment, which is at page 92a —
no, I'm sorry — yes, page 92a of the Appendix, paragraph 3
goes only to the union's — to the claims against the union
under Title VII.
As we —■
QUESTION:

Was there a subsequent judgment

entered pursuant to paragraph 3 of that order granting the
motion for summary judgment?
MRS. GREENBERG:

No.

The only other order in the

case was the order dismissing without prejudice.
QUESTION:

As to the union as well as to the

other defendants?
MRS. GREENBERG:

As to everyone.

The complaint

was dismissed without prejudice.
QUESTION:

That's kind of inconsistent with the

granting of a motion for a summary judgment, isn't it?
MRS. GREENBERG:

Oh, the granting for motion for

summary judgment was an interlocutory order, and there never
was a final appealable order.
QUESTION:

Yes, but I take it if you could get

45
that from an affirmative judgment, you could appeal from that
tomorrow.
MRS. GREENBERG;
QUESTION;

If you could get —- I'm sorry?

If you could get the District Court to

— the granting of summary judgment in the form of a judgment,
you could appeal from that tomorrow, because —
MRS. GREENBERG;
QUESTION;

Yes.

— there's never been an appealable

judgment up to this date.
MRS. GREENBERG;

Yes.

That is our position, and

the question was never certified.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mrs.

Greenberg.
Thank you, gentlemen.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
