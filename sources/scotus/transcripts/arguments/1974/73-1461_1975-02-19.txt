MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGER; We will hear arguments
next in Ho. 73-1461, Stanton against Stanton.
Mr. Roe.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYCE E„ ROE , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ROE:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
The. State of Utah has a statute on its books and
has had since 1352 that females attain their majority at the
age of eighteen years and that males attain theirs at the age
o f twehty-one.
In the case today we’re challenging that statute
under the Equal Protection Clause of Amendment Fourteen.
The facts out of which the case arose are quite
simple.

This was a divorce proceeding in which the wife had

been awarded custody of two children, and the husband had been
ordered to pay support money for the two children.
Some years after the entry of the divorce decree,
•the wife filed a proceeding in the district court to have some
past-due support money reduced to judgment.

She contended

that the husband was obligated to continue to pay support
money for the children, even though the wife, or the daughter
had achieved the age of eighteen years.
QUESTION;

Is it common in Utah to have a support

4
provision in a decree fail to identify the precise age to which
the support money is to be paid?
MR. ROE:

It’s not uncommon, Your Honor.

both ways, actually.

It happens

I think more careful counsel nowadays do

put some provision in the decree.

But there have been frequent

cases in which the decree has provided only that they will pay
support for the children.
QUESTION: The parties here could have provided for
termination at any age, I take it, by agreement?
MR. ROE:

By a stipulation, I would see no reason why

they could not have done that.
QUESTION:

This decree was something that was

negotiated and agreed upon between -the parties?
MR* ROE: There was a stipulation for the decree, and
for the awarding of the divorce to the wife and for the
granting of custody to her and to the payment of support for
the children.

The decree did not say to what age the support

would continue.
QUESTION:

But it was negotiated against the back­

ground of this statute, this long-standing statute of Utah,
wasn’t it?
MR. ROE:

Yes.

at that time, however»

There were two statutes in effect
There was a statute enacted three years

before this divorce, in 1957, which was the
Liability For Suoport Act.

Uniform Civil

QUESTION:
HR. ROE:

IJHh-hunh.
In that, statute, "child” was defined as

being a child of either sex under the age of twenty-one.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. ROE;

So there is some —■ this was a statute

that had not been in force very long at the time of tin at
decree.
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you about that statute.

Was this argued to tine lower courts in your State in this
case?
MR, ROE:

The application of the .support statute?

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, ROE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

it was.

Well, would that statute win your case

for you?
MR. ROE:

It would have won the case for us if tine

Supreme Court had seen fit to interpret it as establishing
the age to which support would continue in a divorce proceeding.
Now, the Supreme Court of Utah did not discuss the
statute, even though it was brief to tine Court.

But — so we

have a situation in which we don't have a support denied to
daughters over the age of eighteen, while it's given to sons
between eighteen and twenty-one, because the support statute
provides that the support will continue for both of them until
they're twenty-one.

Except that under the support statute the

6
obligee is the ons or daughter.

So that any action to enforce

the support, outside of the divorce decree, would have to be
brought by the son or daughter
QUESTION:

But the fact remains that in this case,

under the State decision, support for the daughter stops.
QUESTION: That's right.
MR. ROE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And it would not have ~~ and it would not
stop for a son.
MR. ROE5
QUESTION;

Well, it stops in a divorce proceeding.
Yes, but it stops, does it not, because,

in effect, this statute 15~2-~1,

your Supreme Court has read

into the divorce decree, hasn't it?
MR. ROE:

That’s correct.

QUESTION: Well now

,

So —-

.if that's so, what we in effect

have .is an ordinary support decree, as if it had been
negotiated between the parties, as the Court has construed it;
is it not?
MR. ROE:

Well, but this construction didn't

occur until some time after the Court
QUESTION:

Well, whether it did or didn't, whatever

it may have been, isn't that the fact?
MR„ ROE:

No, I don't think the Court based this on

any concept that the parties have stipulated with respect to
the ages at which

7
QUESTION: Well# no, I didn’t suggest that.

But as

if they had stipulated.
How, otherwise# did this Court read this statute
into the divorce decree?
MR. ROE: Well, it said that support money ends
at the age of majority.

Daughters attain their majority

when they're eighteen.
So the support money ends.

That was the reasoning

of the Utah Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

What’s the precise language of the

stipulation and the decree?
Do you have —•

QUESTION;

Page 7 of the Appendix?

QUESTION:

Appellant’s brief.

"Defendant is ordered to pay to plaintiff"

is

that it?
MR. ROE:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor.
Yet it did leave open# I take it# the

Supreme Court of Utah# the possibility that if the decree
had provided otherwise# the statute would have played no part?
MR. ROE;

I suppose it was left open.

The question

was not raised or discussed in that —
QUESTION;

Then the Court construed the decree as

meaning support until they reach the majority?

And then# as a

0
matter of law, under the statute, that meant eighteen for the
girl.
MR. ROE;

Yes, Your Honor.

It was decided on the

basis, on the statute and its application to a divorce proceed­
ing.
QUESTION;

Mr. Roe, if you prevail here, do you still

win or lose then,what is the date under this statute that
support ceases, is it eighteen for both boys and girls?
Or is it twenty-one?
MR» ROE;

Well, I would think that looking — oh,

excuse me, Your Honor?
QUESTION;

Or is it twenty-one for both sons and

daughters?
MR. ROEs

Yes, I would think, looking at the general

legislative policy, it would have to be twenty-one.

For both»

QUESTION; Well, is that something we can determine
here?
Isn’t that something

suppose we strike it down
y
■
j

as violative of Equal Protection, isn’t that something for the
Utah Court to consider?
MR. ROE:

Well, there is — this Court, I think,

can decide the effect of the invalidity of the statute.
Mow, at common law, of course, the age of majority
for both men and women was twenty-one years»

One of the

possibilities is to apply the common law, without regard to

9

the statute.
In addition, we have a general declaration of
legislative policy that support will contine for children
until they're twenty-one years,,

So we're — until they’re

twenty-one years old* both of them.
And then we have the situation in which the excluded
group should be given the benefit of the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, but if the Supreme Court of Utah

were to come out and say, if this Court were to invalidate the
distinction, the Supreme Court of Utah would say, All right,
from now on it's eighteen for everybody.

Then your client

would take nothing, you would not benefit at all from this
lawsuit,
MR. ROE:

That's — if the Supreme Court of Utah

felt it could do that, that is correct.

We would have to

lose on that question.
QUESTION:

You suggest that’s a remote prospect,

in view of the fact that this Court has said that eighteen
is the voting age, which of course doesn't directly bear on
til is?
MR* ROE:

Well, yes, I think you’re talking about

two different things here.

I recognize that there has been

a tendency to reduce the age to eighteen in a number of
instances.

In the Utah statutory scheme, that is correct,

too, with respect to a lot of the activities and a lot of the

10
disabilities that are placed upon children*
But. in this application particularly, twenty-one is
the age to which support should be given.

Because xvre have a

subsequent statute that establishes that? so that what has
really happened with the Utah Supreme Court in ruling as it
did is to place a different kind of burden on eighteen to
twenty-one-year-old daughters than on eighteen to twenty-oneyear-old sons, even though they're both entitled to support.
Under the Uniform Civil Liability For Support Act,
one of them can obtain this support by the parent going into
the divorce proceeding over which the court retains jurisdic­
tion, customarily, and obtaining a support order or use the
contempt features and so on.
Whereas a daughter achieving the age of eighteen
would be corape lied to bring a suit against her father, if she
was entitled to support and he was the one who had the money
with which to support her.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roe, in this case, could the

daughter have brought suit under Utah law to enforce this
marital settlement agreement?
MR. ROE:
that has been done.

She — I have never found a case in which
The Supreme Court of Utah has talked in

some instances as if the right, at least for current support,
belongs to the child, though -they talk in terms of past-due
support which has been supplied by a parent as being a right

that is in the parent.
In other wards , -there are limitations upon the extent
to which the parties can stipulate away the right of a child
to current and future support, but with respect to past
support if the money has been, or the support has been
provided, then the parent has the right and the child doesn't.
QUESTION:

In this case, -the support money had been

provided by the parent, is that right?
MR. ROE:

Yes.

There has been no issue about that.

She was living with her mother, she had custody of her, and
was taking care of her.
QUESTION:

Mr, Roe, I think, that opinion of your

Supreme Court is not a model of clarity, but my questions
earlier are prompted by what appears at 10a and 11a of the
opinion. "The general rule is that the decree fixes the
obligations of the parties,"
And over at 11a, "the support money accrued in
accordance with its terms."
Now, how are we to read that?

If not that the

Supreme Court, your Supreme Court, read this decree as incor­
porating the provisions of that statute,
MR. ROE:

Well, it certainly did do that,

I don't

think it read the stipulation of the parties as doing that,
and that's just what we're complaining about; that the
decree here incorporates the provisions of a statute which

operates unfairly and invidiously with respect to one class.
Now, if it were a stipulated judgment,
QUESTIONS

Well, but the difficulty •*-» isn't the

difficulty with that that the parties did agree to that -- I
think you told us earlier, that the consent, the decree was
agreed upon by the parties, the divorce decree that is, when
entered? wasn't it?
MR» ROEs
decree.

Well, it was a simple stipulation before

The -- I think it’s fairly customary that they say;

We stipulate that the divorce may be entered if the mother
proves grounds, and that she may have custody, and we'll pay
so much support money.
Now, where
QUESTION;

But the problem here is not whether the

money should be paid to the daughter? rather, it is whether
the money shall be paid to the mother*
MR. ROE;

That is correct.

QUESTION: Because she's the one who is — the one
under the decree, according to the terms of the decree, is the
one to whom the husband pays the money.
MR. ROE;
QUESTION:

Yes, this is
And now I'm only suggesting that it

seems to me that your Supreme Court is, in effect, reading the
decree as limiting the husband's obligation for support nor
payments to the mother on behalf of the daughter, to the years

13
before she’s eighteen, and for the son until he's twenty-one.
MR

4

ROE:

Well, that’s what the Court’s doing.

I

don't — I didn’t read the opinion as if the Court were saying,
looking back at 19GO and in view of the statutes then, what
the parties did and what the Court did by way of -- by means
of interpretation, I should say, they meant to fix this at
eighteen instead of twenty-one.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the parties -- what if the

agreement —- what if the stipulation had said:

support until

their majority?
MR. ROE:

I think we would still have the same

question.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but than you wouldn't if
they had said — if, after the daughter's name, they would
have said eighteen in parentheses, and —
MR. ROE:

No, I think —

QUESTION:

— after the son, twenty-one.

They

would have agreed to it?
MR, ROE:

If the parties agreed to pay support to

one of them until she was eighteen and the other until twentyone, and the court approved it —
QUESTION:

If they said "their majority”, and the

State statute specified what the majority was.
MR. ROE:
said first.

Well, I'll agree.

I take bade what I

I think we would have a different case —

14
QUESTIONS Well now, it’s arguable that the Supreme
Court of Utah has equated your situation with that — with ray
supposition, in that when you agreed just to provide support,
t hat meant, under State law, until their majority? which in
turn meant until eighteen and twenty-one.
MR. ROE:

Yes.

But this decision was based upon an

interpretation of the State law and its application, and not
upon 'the use of the State law to try and interpret what the
parties were stipulating to.
QUESTION:

How does that square with the proposition

that I understood you accepted, that Mr. and Mrs. Stanton could
have agreed in -that stipulation and decree on age eighteen for
both, twenty for both, twenty-one for both, or twenty-five for
both?
MR. ROE:

Yes,

QUESTION: And they merely incorporated something by
reference here.

Why isn't it still' just a stipulation and not

a statutory question?
MR. ROE:

But the stipulation did not purport to

incorporate anything, did not, in fact, refer to age of
majority, it referred only to children.

In tine context in

which this stipulation was entered into, having come threeyears after a new statute putting the obligation on parents
to support their children until they are twenty-one years old,
and the possibility of interpretation of that statute, within

the terms of the decree, then 1 don't think that could be read
as having agreed that the age of majority would be the
controlling age.
QUESTION:

Certainly as one reads the opinion of

the Supreme Court of the State of Utahr its rationale doesn't
seem to be, at all, as indicated in questions from the bench.
Right at. the beginning the Court states that the question
before it is the constitutionality of Section 15-2-1, Utah
Code Annotated 1953,
HR. ROE;

Yes, Your Honor, —

QUESTION;

~~ and goes on to consider the

constitutionality of that statute.
MR. ROE;

Yes, and

QUESTION;
parties

It doesn’t suggest at all chat the

that it's construing the decree as such, and that

since it was a negotiated decree it's equivalent to having
explicitly said;

support the son until he's twenty-one and

the daughter until she's eighteen.
That's no part of its rationale, as I read it.
MR® ROE;

Well, I could not read that case that

way, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

I'm talking about this case, the opinion

in this case.
MR, ROE;

Yes, I mean the Supreme Court's opinion.

QUESTION: Right

16

MR. ROE:

Well, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggests, 1

think the Court did do this, or decide this case on constitu­
tional grounds and statutory interpretation.

And it's that —

on that basis in which we’re challenging the statute and the
decision of the Utah Supreme Court.
Of course, the age of majority statute, as such, cuts
both ways.

I recognize that.

It has some effects other than

in the support money area, which we're not necessarily con­
cerned with, but which possibly have to be anticipated.
It offers benefits to one and detriments to another,
in different kinds of situations.
But this proceeding, of course, is directed solely
at the application, or primarily at the application of that
statute to the support, statutes.
The Utah Supreme Court used some rather traditional
rationalisations to uphold the statute.

One of them being -that

it's a man's primary responsibility to provide a home.

This

was the breadwinner argument which was rejected by the Court,
I believe, in the Frontierc case.
They indicated also -chat the son needs a good
education or training.

I submit that the daughter also needs

one.
Also the classic argument that girls tend to mature
earlier than boys, which again is one of the arguments made
I

in some of the previous cases, particularly Reed v« Reed.

I

1?
think in that case the Idaho Supremae Court sought to ration­
alize its statute on the basis that men were more qualified
to bo personal representatives than women were.
And the fourth rationalization of the Court was that
girls tend to marry earlier, which is not a rationalization at
all, because you can’t, tell which is cause and which is effect;
whether the fact that they marry earlier comes from the fact
that they may he denied the support that is given to the male
children.
QUESTION;

But the statute wipes that out, anyway, —

QUESTION s

Yes.

QUESTIONS

— .in that when a girl marries, she no

longer is subject to the provisions for support; as I read it.
MR. ROE:

Yes, that’s right.

All children reach

their majority on marriage under the statute.
QUESTION;
MR. ROE:

Of either sex.
Yes —

QUESTION:

Of either sex.

MR. ROE:

Of either sex.

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, in trying to find the legislative rationaliza­
tion for a statute like this is difficult, because the Utah
Legislature approached these various things differently, with
respect to the ages at which male children and female children
reach their majority.
For instance, in other legislation, and in const!tu-

tional provisions of Utah, malas and females of the same ages
have the right to vote and hold office, the right to serve as
jurors, the right to practice law, make dispositions of
properties by will; they're both subject to Juvenile Court
jurisdiction at tha same ages; automobile licensing.

The

general duty of support, as set out in the General Support
statute, and to public assistance under the

Public Assistance

Program.
I point these out primarily to suggest that there is
no rational basis in the total legislative schema that
suggests a view on the part of the Legislature that the female
children are more competent at a particular age than the males,
QUESTION:

So that’s maybe five years later.
I notice you cite Frontiero
and Reed
_i
VT=.-n—

you don't mention Shevin v.Kahn.
MR. ROE:
QUESTION s

Yes, I —
Would that have anything to do with it?

19
MR, ROE:

I did mention Shevin, or Kahn vs. 3heyin,

but only briefly.
I would like to say this about the cases together.
I've tried to find, if I could, a common thread in them, and
I think the one common thread I can find is that the surmises
and the speculations with respect to legislative intention and
some of the deference paid to the judgments of the Legis­
lature has been subjected to a closer look.
But even in the cases which the Court has upheld
the sex-based discrimination or the sex-based classification,
I should say, it has taken a look at the basis on which the
statute is sought to be upheld and has made a careful analysis
of what the State is trying to accomplish in the methods by
which it is doing it#
I think that would be true of the — not only of
Kahn vs. Shevin, but of the Geduldig vs, Aiello, and also
Schj.esinger vs. Ballard, in cases where the sex-based classifi­
cation has been upheld or at least a classification which is
contended to be sex-based.
We have in this case, too, as the Court has had
before it in a number of others, that we don't have any
legislative history that gives any guidance as to what the
Legislature had in mind.
There are a couple of points that have been raised
in the briefs with respect to the standing, for instance, of

20

the plaintiff here to bring this action.
A recent Utah case has reaffirmed what I pointed out
earlier# and that is that the parent who has paid the support
money is the one who — or has supported the child is the one
who has -the right to receive the support.
That recent case was decided in October of last year.,
it's Baggs vs. Anders on, in. 528 Pac 2d, 141.

That was since

the briefs were filed in this case.
Moreover, the Court here has held that the one
challenging the statute need not necessarily be a member of
the class.

The most recent one, I believe, involving the

women jurors and their need to request jury service, in Taylor
V3.^ Louis iana.
The question of mootness has been raised, it being
contended that the daughter is new over the age of twenty-one
years, and so that the question is moot? however, the
plaintiff in this case still has a question of her right to
$2700 riding on the outcome, which would seem not to make the
case moot.
Thank you vary much.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DENNIS FREDERICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. FREDERICK:
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

21
The Court has the language of the very statute which
is being challenged here, and I might just state briefly the
language is that "The period of minority extends in males to
the age of twenty-one years and in females to that of eighteen
years? but all minors attain their majority by marriage."
I think that there are four critical elements, or
four critical problems with the Appellant*s case here? a
couple of which have been touched on in the questions asked
of counsel in his argument.
I think, first, as this Court is well aware, the
Appellant here is not in any representative capacity on
behalf of her daughter? she is here in her own right, alleging
•that the statute in fact discriminates against her as a class
*— that being the class of mothers of daughters in the eighteen
to twenty-one-year age group.
I submit that, at this juncture, she has no standing,
as, in fact, not only is she admittedly not a member of the
class which the statute is designed to affect, that is,
persons attaining majority? but she is indeed not even a
member of the class which she claims is being discriminated
against as, in fact, the daughter in question here turned
twenty-one ever a year ago.
The second point, which I believe has a very direct
bearing on this -QUESTIONs But she has standing as to her asking for

22

moneys past due, does she not?
MR. FREDERICKS
However, my

That is correct, Your Honor.

I submit to the Court that that's not before

us here? that’s a claim for moneys paid and not in fact a
bearing on the constitutionality of this statute.
QUESTION: Well, isn’t that how this whole lawsuit
arose?
MR» FREDERICK? That is correct.
QUESTION: And it does involve three years' worth of
support payments.
MR. FREDERICK:

It does, Your Honor.

The record

does reflect that the daughter did in fact reside with the
mother for most if not all of the time in question here.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh,

MR. FREDERICK:

I would, however, submit that even

«

if the Court finds that she has established a right which is
in jeopardy here, or has established that she will sustain a
substantial injury, that she is estopped now to claim -- make
that claim.

As the Court and the record establishes, without

question, the decreed: divorce entered in this matter in
November of 1960 was in fact a stipulated decree of divorce,
and a consent decree was entered.
Both parties involved in that matter were in fact
represented by counsel, and I submit that the Appellant here
is charged with either actual or constructive knowledge of

23

what, the law in Utah was at that time, and that in fact was,
without question, that the support payments for a daughter
terminate at eighteen, under the statute here challenged.
She, the Appellant, may have contracted otherwise,
but chose not to do so.

tod this Court has long recognized

the doctrine of equitable estoppel.

And. I submit that here

the Appellant is estopped to assert that argument.
QUESTION ;

Well, what's involved here in dollars and

cents is three years, is it?
MR. FREDERICK;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION; This young lady became twenty-one on
February 12, nineteen seventy- —

QUESTION:

I take it, even if there were a reversal

here, is it — I mean — then it would have to go back to the

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, that

24
takes from —
QUESTION:

You might still win.

MR. FREDERICK;

The point that I am here going to

raise next, I think there's no substantial federal question
here.
The defect, No. 1, of this statute, that is claimed
in any event, has long since been cured by, as counsel stated,
the adoption by Utah of the Uniform Civil Support Act ~Liability for Support Act.
That was adopted in 1957, and it requires not only
fathers but mothers to give support in appropriate circumstances
to their children until they arrive at the age of twenty-one.
QUESTIONs

But this would be quite independent of a

divorce decree or any divorce proceeding?
MR. FREDERICKS

It is.

Yes, sir, it is.

It has no

relationship to the holdings of the Utah Supreme Court with
regard to when support terminates•

It's in the nature of,

I suppose, what we commonly call pauper statutes.

But neither

the Appellant here nor the daughter have seen, fit to avail
themselves of that alternative State .remedy.
They've chosen, as a matter of fact, to challenge
the statute on which our Supreme Court has determined that
support shall end.
A

further aspect of this argument is that this is a

political question.

QUESTION:

Well, let's see, does that mean that

between the time she was eighteen and twenty-one the mother,
anyway, under this new statute, had art obligation to supply
support whether or not the father did?
MR. FREDERICK!

Absolutely.

That's absolutely the case under the statute in —
QUESTION s And the mother did in fact supply the
support in those three years?
MR. FREDERICKS
QUESTIONS

We don’t dispute that. She —

So that if she has any basis to attempt

to secure contribution from the husband, how does she go about
it?
MR, FREDERICK: She would have the alternative remedy
of either through the State Welfare Department or in the
daughter's own name, to pursue the father as an obligee for
reimbursement.
QUESTION: And

then what does he do?

Does he pay

■die —“ have to reimburse her for -the full amount?
MR, FREDERICK: Well, he would either be determined,
I take it, in that proceeding, to owe that support which has
been paid for the daughter? he's only co-responsible with the
mother for the support of that daughter.
If, however, it were to come through payments by the
Utah State Welfare Department, then he would be obligated to
reimburse the Welfare Department,

At tills particular time, I think it's very appropriate
to state that there are currently pending before the Utah State
Legislature three separate bills which have a bearing on this
issue.

One of which is the Equal Rights Amendment? secondarily

there is —
QUESTIONs

I thought I heard this morning they

rejected it last night.
MR. FREDERICK:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry to hear that, Your Honor.

So the radio said.

[Laughter. 3
MR, FREDERICK:

I had not heard that news.

In any event, there are two other bills pending,
which would seek to make the age of majority uniform? one of
which.would make the age of majority twenty-one uniformly, and
the other eighteen.
But, in any event, while these matters are pending
before the Utah State Legislature, it seems to me that this
acknowledgement of the political nature of this type of
question was appropriately referred to by Mr. Justice Powell
in his concurring opinion of Frontiero.
The Equal Rights Amendment, which, if adopted, will
resolve the substance of this precise question, has been
approved by the Congress and submitted for ratification by the
Statas.

If the Amendment is duly adopted, it will represent,

the will of the people, accomplished in the manner prescribed

27
by the Constitution,
By acting prematurely and unnecessarily, as I view
it, the Court has assumed a decisional responsibility at the
very time when State Legislatures, functioning within the
traditional democratic process, are debating the proposed
Amendment.
It seems to me that by reaching out to preempt by
judicial action a major political decision, which is currently
in process of resolution, does not reflect appropriate respect
for the duly prescribed legislative processes.
In addition, I x^ould submit, that the recent, most
recent cases by this Court, dealing with the so-called sexbased discrimination matters, would provide that there in
fact is a rational basis for the s 'abstanti citi on of this
statute here under question, that in fact the Courts in
Kahn vs. Shevin, this Court, Gedu1dig vs. Aie1lo and the
Schlesinger vs. Ballard case has stated that the courts will
not or should not substitute their social and economic beliefs
for the judgment of the Legislatures.
If there is a fair and substantial relation to the
legislative objective to be sought or to be advanced, the
statute will stand.
In this particular instance, I submit that the State
objective to be established or to be sought is to pinpoint
an objectively identifiable point in time whan a member of

28

society is given the responsibilities and benefits of adult­
hood.
It is to set an age at which the disabilities of
infancy are removed.

The Utah Legislature has made the

determination that certain segments of the society are more
capable of coping with these rights and responsibilities,
namely married persons and females over the age of eighteen
and males over twenty-one, and the view has traditionally
been, correct or not, that a woman matures emotionally and
physically at an earlier age than men.
This statute is merely the codification of that
traditional view.

And I submit that it does provide a fair

and substantial means to promote a State objective and it is
for those reasons I submit that the statute must be sustained.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you nave anything

further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYCE E. ROE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ROEs

Just one statement, if the Court please,
>

and that is the estoppel matter.
The decisions just weren't that clear prior to this
case, as to whether the support obligation ended at age
eighteen, following the enactment of the Support Act,
And there we re very — I did not really find any

29

decisions even prior to that in which there was a clear holding
as to the age at which, it ended.
But it was the argument we made to the Utah Supreme
Court with respect to that, was that the support money payment
ended at majority, at common law, because that’s when the duty
of a parent to support ended.
And when the Legislature changed that, then it was
a rational basis for changing the application to the divorce
proceedings,
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rocs.

Thank you, Mr. Frederick.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:58 o’clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
