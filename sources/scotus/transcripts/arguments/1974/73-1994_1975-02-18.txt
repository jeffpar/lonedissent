MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We vrill hear arguments
Motor Company.

Mr. Jaques.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD C.JAQUES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAQUES:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the

Court:
In 1962, an intoxicated seaman was going back to his
ship in Louisiana.

He fell asleep on a railroad track before

he got there.
QUESTION: Does the record show he was intoxicated,
Mr. Jaques?
MR. JAQUES:

Yes, Your Honor,,

The record shows that the particular case I'm
citing
QUESTION:

This was before he got to the railroad

track, or what?
MR.JAQUES:
get to the ship.

Got to the railroad track, couldn't

Laid down on a railroad track.

cane along, amputated both legs.

A train

The question arose:

what

duty did the shipowner have with regard to payment of
maintenance and cure?
The Fifth Cire iit held, in Myer vs._ Quinn-Manhattan
Fisheries, 302 Fed 2d 146, that the duty of the shipowner did

terminate at the time that there was provided for the seaman
a fitting of artificial legs.
The Sixth Circuit would hold, in 1975, -that there
was no duty at all,, to provide any cure, any maintenance for
the seaman, in its holding on the Vella case.
The Sixth Circuit had indicated that one who was
afflicted by trauma with a vestibular labyrinthine disorder
had actually reached the maximum cure at the time that the
incident occurred»
This is borne in the opinion on page 29 of the brief
of the Appendix.

And there the Court statedt

"The record in this case does not permit an inference
other than that plaintiff’s condition was permanent immediately
after the accident»"
To look at the Sixth Circuit holding with regard to
this case, it would necessarily follow that there could be no
manner by which a seaman who had reached that point of
maximum medical cure, as was enunciated by this Court in
Farrell vs» United States, where there had been, in fact, a
declaration that there had been a maximum cure rendered for
the treatment of the seaman»
For, indeed, if, once that particular declaration
is made by a medical authority, according to the Sixth
Circuit, relating back the very onset of the incident which
created the'injury or the illness would have been, in fact,

5
incurable.
Well, looking on these cases relative to maintenance
and cure, the cure aspect, while it doesn’t mean cure in the
medical sense solely, it means care.
The question arises to what extent?

This Court

has never indicated that where there is treatment to provide
a cure an amelioratory nature, would not permit a seaman
to come within the scope of the doctrine.

This Court has

never addressed itself to that very particular question.
It recognized that in Farrell and also in Vaughan
vs. Atkinson, that the majority held that a seaman is not
entitled to maintenance and cure payments for a lifetime.
But, indeed, the circuits have interpreted Farrell,
since it came down in 1949, the Third Circuit and the Fifth
Circuit has consistently held -- and I must point out that
these two circuits, the Third and the Fifth, are quite
active maritime circuits, much mere than the Sixth Circuit.
But with regard to test, 1 cite the case of Smith
vs. Dale Hart^ Incorporated, that's 315 Fed Supp 1162, or 1969
AMC 2400; I cite it for the language,,
In that case the Court held that the maximum
medical care does not mean to the point where a seaman has
the ability to return to work, but to restore the seaman to
the status of a functional human being.
Now, in that case, it's very similar to the case of

6
Vella.
An action was brought for negligence under the Jones
Act.

In addition to unseaworthiness of the vessel, it was

held that there was no unseaworthiness of the vessel, no
negligence under the Jones Act.
A third count, however, was with regard to mainten­
ance and cure.
In that case the seaman suffered from a rheumatoid
arthritic condition, a degenerative spinal condition0
orthopedic surgeon said;

I can operate on him.

The

I can't cure

him to the point where he will go back to sea, but I can cause
him to be alleviated the pain and nothing more.
And there the Court held that this would be
compensable.

And this is in line with the cases of the Third

Circuit, such as Hard ~
QUEfiTION:

Mr. Jaques, do you think that kind of a

question is raised by our
on?

the question we granted certiorari

Where we just granted one of your three questions that

you presented in your petition;

that was whether a seaman is

entitled to maintenance and cure during the interim between the
occurrence of the incident and the time the disease was
medically diagnosed and declared incurable.
MR. JAQ'UES!

Indeed, Your Honor, indeed.

Because

embodied within ‘that question, as it was framed, would be the
question as to when, at what time -- at what time does the

7
seaman — no.

The scope and duration, under what circumstance

does he come within the scope, and once he is within the
scope, what is the duration»
And here in the Sixth Circuit opinion, under a very
novel pronouncement, the Sixth Circuit said; There is more
than a one “-step proposition»
Such as this Court held in The Oceqla, back in 1898,
where a seaman was required to show that he actually sustained
injury or became ill in the service of the vessel, and at that
time it meant, Your Honor, that he must have been actually
performing work activities on the vessel.
Now, this Court, in the Calmar vs, Taylor case,
extended that and put the seaman ashore, and where he is in
fact injured ashore or sustains injury ashore, that is
construed to be in the service of the ship even though it's
on a personal basis.
QUESTION:

But your man was injured aboard the

ship, though, wasn't he?
MR* JAQtJES ;
QUESTIONS
MR. JAQUESs

Very true.
Doing his work, wasn't he?
Indeed he was.

B^lt the Sixth Circuit

held that that wasn't enough, that showing, in and of itself,
is not enough, Your Honor.
The Sixth Circuit held, just as the shipowner
argued, that he must not only show that he was injured while

8
in the service of -the vessel, and indeed there's no question,
and they concede that, the shipowner indeed concedes that he
was injured, that the jury did find that he was injured while
in the service of the vessel.
Rut the Sixth Circuit holds that the seaman has an
additional duty;

that he must go forward and show that he

has, that whatever he is afflicted with is curable.
This is why it is, indeed, important to make a
determination as to whether or not this additional step that's
required in accordance with the law, take that situation alone.
A seaman who is saddled with the responsibility to
go forward to get medical authority to indicate that whatever
he is afflicted with is curable in this day, with the special
problems that the physicians have now.
It would be very difficult.

When I say problem,

I'm talking about physicians having problems with regard to
malpractice insurance.

And for a. physician to diagnose some"

one with a specific type of disability and for the shipowner
to require the physician to indicate that he does in fact
have a curable ailment may be construed by doctors as a
contract to cure, with the inherent *— and I don't mean this
disparagingly -- but with the inherent tendency of medical
practitioners to act on a conservative basis, it's doubtful
that any seaman could ever get any doctor to make such a
declaration.

9

QUESTIONS

Mr. Jaques, as I understand it, the jury

awarded your client maintenance and cure for a period of two
years from the time he was discharged from the vessel until
a period two years later?
MR. JAQUES:
QUESTIONS
of?

That's correct.

That's right»

What does maintenance and cure consist

Is it basically room and board?
MR. JAQUES:

Maintenance means sustenance? cure

means care.
It has been established by collective bargaining
contracts that this is set at a rate of eight dollars per day;
rather unrealistic because it is supposed to be the kind of
care and treatment and lodging that he would have received
aboard the ship; no better, no worse.
QUESTION:

Is this on the assumption that he's

disabled and in the hospital during this period?
MR. JAQUESs

On the assumption that he is disabled.

On not — more than an assumption, Your Honor? but then,
indeed, the fact that he is disabled and unfit for sea duty.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't the actual practice now for

an injured or an ill seaman to go into a public hospital?
MR. JAQUES:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Health Service Hospital; that is correct.
QUESTION:

A Public Health hospital,

MR. JAQUES:

Right.

QUESTION: And is that covered generally by collective
bargaining agreements or not?
MR. JAQUES:
QUESTION:

That’s covered by statute, Your Honor.
Unh-hunh,

And that’s where he goes,

that's where he gets his maintenance and cure generally, isn't
it?
MR. JAQUES:

Well, he gets maintenance and cure

while he's in a -QUESTION:

Unless he’s an — until he becomes an

outpatient?
MR, JAQUES:

That's correct.

He's not entitled to

payments until — well, until he's an outpatient if, in fact,

he had been interned in the medical facility.
QUESTION:

Unh-huh.

MR. JAQUES:

Oftentimes they are not.

Oftentimes

they are simply treated as outpatients, but unfit for duty.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh,

QUESTION:

Mr. Jaques, could I translate this into

the facts of your case?

Your third cause of action, of course,

is rather wide open in this request for relief; but what would
you be satisfied with?

With the per diem up to the time of

the rendition of the medical judgment of the inner ear problem?

11
MR. JAQUES:

I would be — well,, with regard to

maintenance and cure benefits inured to my client, I would
be satisfied for maintenance and cure payments up to the time
where there had been a diagnosis and declaration by a medical
authority that the disease was in fact incurable.

And that

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that had come within a

week of the accident?
MR. JAQUES:
accident

If that had come within a week of the

now, I must say, Your Honor, when I answered this

question, I had put it on strictly the hypothetical basis
that — or predicated on exactly as you phrased it.
Now, if it happened within one week, I would say
that the test would go to what I had set forth in my brief on
page 17, which I — and I did. propose the test to show as
follows:
A seaman who has contracted by trauma —- but I'11
change that:

A seaman who has become ill, and the illness

or injury is of a permanent nature, while in the service of
the vessels comes within the scope of maintenance and cure
benefits and shall continue to be entitled to those benefits
until cured or until the disease is diagnosed and declared by
medical authority that the maximum degree of improvement of
the seaman's health has been reached.
Now, that would take care --

12
QUESTION:

When did you reach that in this case,

according to the Sixth Circuit?
MR, JAQUES:

Well, the Sixth Circuit said it was

reached when it happened, and that's not keeping within the
purpose of the doctrine,
QUESTION:

You mean as soon as it was done, when it

was diagnosed that it was incurable, it always had been
incurable, and no maintenance and cure?
MR. JAQUESs

That's what the Sixth Circuit said.

QUESTION: The Sixth Circuit's posture is that you
have to ride

until that diagnosis was made, and it happened

a good bit of time afterward.
MR, JAQUES:

I follow this -- I would follow,

Your Honor, what this Court has set forth, particularly in the
Farrell vs. United States case, and in that case it says this
Court adopted the treaty

well, the draft convention, which

really was a treaty — in 1939. And that treaty is set forth
in the brief in the precise language, on page 11:
"The shipowner shall be liable to defray the ex­
pense of medical care and maintenance until the sick or
injured seaman has been cured, or until the sickness or
incapacity has been declared of a permanent character.
QUESTION s

You think Farrell is authority for

applying that on the Great Lakes?
MR. JAQUES:

Why, absolutely, Your Honor.

This

13
Court has never made a dichotomy with regard to maintenance
and cure benefits with reference to high seas and the Great
Lakes.
And I concede, Your Honor, that this particular
treaty did not have bearing on Great Lakes seamen, indeed,
by its language it meant only persons on the high seas.

But

in this -QUESTION:

Now, you're asking for a remand to the

trial court for the entry of an amended order of judgment?
which is to say you're not satisfied with the verdict you got
from the jury.
MR. JAQUES;

I•think that the jury verdict, under

the proper test in the

instructions of the court was not

correct.
QUESTION: Well, can you ask us to do that?

You

didn't appeal the jury verdict yourself to the Court of
Appeals, did you?
MR. JAQUESs
as to the additur,

I simply indicate here that the question

of the verdict was not brought before the

Court of Appeals? but I submit
QUESTION:

Well, how can you ask us to do it if

you didn't appeal to the Court of Appeals yourself?
MR, JAQUES:

Well, I concede, Your Honor, that this

is a circumstance where the Court may, under the proper
condition, be loath to grant that which was not sought.

14
QUESTION:

As I understand it, what you got. from the

jury was for two years, was it, from June 29, 1968?
HR. JAQUES;
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
And you’re asking for almost four years,

from June 29, ’68 to April 27, 1972.
MR. JAQUES:

Is that correct?

That’s correct.

And that's because

of the test that the Court has established.
QUESTION: Well, you see, our difficulty — at least
my difficulty is that I don’t see how you can ask us to do
that, when you didn't appeal, cross*-appeal to the Court of
Appeals.
MR. JAQUES:

I realise, but the Court in

retrospect would recognise that the Sixth Circuit would not
lend any credence or even address itself to that proposition,
had it been raised in the appellate court below.
QUESTION: Well, that’s ordinarily not a reason for
not raising it, because you make an advance evaluation that
they won't pay any attention to it;: which is what I understood
you to say.
MR. JAQUES:

I don't make an advance evaluation.

And I agree now, under the circumstances, indeed, it is
questionable whether or not this Court would grant the relief
sought, particularly with regard to the additur,

of the

verdict relative to the maintenance and cure.
QUESTION: What about the issue of attorney's fees?

15
MR. JAQUES: I7ell, that was raised.

The attorney's

fees was raised -QUESTIONs

Well, again, were they denied by the

district court?
MR. JAQUES:

That's correct.

The trial court

>

denied the attorney's fees.
QUESTION: And again you didn't appeal that denial,
did you?
MR. JAQUES:

I did not appeal that to the Sixth

Circuit.
The two-step criteria of the Sixth Circuit — and
really what -the Sixth Circuit is saying:

first, the seaman

must show that he was injured while in the service of the
vessel; and -then he must show that whatever cure he undertakes,
that will be the — that will result into his return to a
f •’

fit-for-duty status.
This is novel.
never held.

This is something this Court has

With regard to the duration, the Sixth Circuit

has criticised in a footnote the Third Circuit relative to
what was held in Ward vs. the Barge Line, where the Third
Circuit indicated that maintenance and cure would go on
so long as there was some type of amelioratory relief.
And the question I would pose would be:

How then

can the Sixth Circuit square itself with Farre11 in this
particular case, because Farrell has indicated that maintenance

16

and cure must be paid until there had been a declaration by
medical authority that the disease was incurable.

And that was

not done until the time of the trial. But the Sixth Circuit
did not even allow the two years that was granted by the jury.
I'll reserve time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Jaques,

Mr. Munde11.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. HtJNDELL, JR. , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MUNDELL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the case of The Booker No. II, 241 Fed 831, the
Court stated, at page 835s
The limits of care or cure, both as to kind of
treatment and kind of continuance, must always depend on the
facts of each particular case.
Respondent in this case contends the facts are of
special significance in the resolution of the issue now before
the Court.
And I would ask the Court to bear with me momentarily
as I recite briefly the facts, because I believe they have a
very special significance.
The petitioner in this case was an oilbrror the S.S.
ROBERT S. MacNAMARA.

He claimed that while replacing a deck

plate in the lower engine room he slipped and fell and bumped

17
his head.

There was some doubt as to whether the petitioner

reported that accident at the time.
Thereafter, petitioner claimed that he suffered
from dizziness, headaches, imbalance, and fear of falling.
But he continued to perform his regular duties until June 28,
1960.

The alleged accident occurred some time,

unknown to the petitioner, in early April of *63.

a date
That meant

he was on the ship for a period of almost ninety days doing
his regular work.
On June 20, the petitioner was discharged from the
vessel for failing to obey the orders of a superior officer.
When the vessel arrived back at Dearborn, the following day,
on June 29, he was paid off and left the vessel.
During the course of the preparation of his dis­
charge papers, the third assistant engineer was doing this,
the petitioner said, and informed the third assistant
engineer, that he had fallen back in April of '68, and an
accident report was prepared»
Petitioner also requested and was issued a master's
certificate, permitting him, or a hospital ticket permitting
to go to the United States Public Health Service hospital,
where free care is provided for merchant seamen.
Immediately upon leaving the vessel, -the petitioner
was examined at respondent's plant hospital.

This hospital

is staff by 15 physicians and 89 nurses, and headed by Dr,

18
Charles

David Laderach.
Based upon the information supplied by the petitioner,

Dr. Laderach gave a diagnosis of alleged left parietal
contusion.
Inasmuch as the petitioner denied visual difficulties,
nausea, vomiting, dizziness or headaches, in the Romberg Test,
which is the test where you close your eyes and if you sway
back and forth it indicates that you have a balance problem,
that test was negative? and similar tests, finger-to-finger
tests with your eyes closed, finger-to-nose with your eyes
closed, again a balance test, these tests were all normal,
Dr. Laderach ruled out vestibular damage.

But based upon the

petitioner's description that there was something electrical
in his head, decided tliat the complaint could relate to a tiny
nerve branch contusion.
This he considered minor, and he ordered a cold pack
applied to that area where he described this hot or
electrical sensation, and discharged as able to work.
From that day, June 29, 1968, petitioner went to the
U. S . Public Health Service Hospital in Detroit on three
occasions?

July 9, July 16, and September 30.
On each of those occasions, he was declared fit

for duty.
It is to be noted in the Appendix, which sets forth
these visits to the Public Health Service Hospital, that the

IS
petitioner, when he went there, he denied he had sustained
any unconsciousness, he had no headaches, dizziness or other
neural problems, and nothing of an objective nature was found.
The final day that he was there, final visit
QUESTION:

Mr, Mundell, are you arguing that there's

insufficient evidence in the record here to justify the jury's
finding against you?
MR, MUNDELL:

Yes, sir,

QUESTION: But is your argument that there was never
anything wrong with him, or that whatever he did have wrong
with him, by way of illness or injury, didn’t occur while he
was in the service of the ship?
MR. MUNDELL:

Both, if the Court please.

It was our contention that when the man left the
ship he was fit for duty.
Now, the jury in this case did give the man two
years’ maintenance.
QUESTION:

There was never a specific finding -And thereby found that he had a physical

condition that occurred while he was in the service of the
ship, necessarily, if the instructions were correct?
MR. MUNDELL:

Yes,

QUESTION; And found that as a fact.
MR, MUNDELL:

Well, that's why, if the Court please,

we appealed the maintenance verdict.
QUES TION:

Unh-hunh.

20
MR. MUM DELL;

We felt there was no basis for this

jury to grant maintenance and. cure to this man.
QUESTION s Did the Court of Appeals ever pass on this
part of your contention?
MR. MUNDELL;

Yes , on -- as to whether or not he

actually was fit for duty or not, or —
QUESTION:

As to whether or not there was evidence,

whether there was evidence to support the verdict.
MR. MUNDELL:

I think the words of the Court were:

presumably the jury found that the man had sustained an injury.
QUESTION:

So they

so at least they didn't

reverse on the ground you're urging now?
MR. MUNDELL:

No.

QUESTION: And they, in effect, rejected that ground?
MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION:

I would believe ~

That you've got two courts saying that

there was evidence, the Court of Appeals and the trial judge?
MR. MUNDELL:
QUESTION:

Well, —

Well, he said it to the jury, didn’t he?

MR. MUNDELL:

Oh, yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we will resume

there at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
MR. MUNDELL:

Very well, Your HOnor.

[Whereupon, at 3:00 p.m,, the Court was recessed, to
reconvene at 10:00 a.m., Wednesday, February 19 „ 1975.]
