MR. CHIE-

JUSTICE BURNER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-156, Hicks against Miranda.
Mrs. Sears.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ORETTA D. SEARS
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. SEARS;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think listening to the consent case I have

somewhat lost my voice.

But hopefully as I proceed it will

become clearer.
What is before the Court today is a many-issue case.
However, I do believe that the Court

..

by

postponing jurisdiction to this day, that they wish to hear
argument on whether or not there was jurisdiction in the Court.
In directing myself to that issue, I would like to
proceed by arguing that both of the orders issued by the court
below, be it the order of June 4th which required people to
return the movies, or the films, and the order of September 30th
which ordered the defendants to in "good faith" petition the
State court for the return of the films,are injunctive.
In determining — first of all, I would like to argue
in
that a declaratory judgment/the defense in an action that
involves a State statute is, to my way of thinking, per se
injunctive within the context of 1253, within the context of
2281 and 2283.

4
A look at the birth of these statutes brings us back
to Ex Parte Young.

But when I read Ex Parte Young» and I

started from there and I went back and reread the last of the
very brilliant decision by members of this Court and by past
members of the Court, I was impressed by one thing, that
Ex Parte Young dealt with one portion of the Eleventh Amendment,
not really, not at all the portion of whether or not a court,
or the Federal court per se of the judicial system, had
jurisdiction over certain causes of action,
the first portion of the amendment.
But what that case dealt x^ith, I think, is expressed
best in Justice Harlan's dissent.

It dealt with that second

portion which says, "In those cases in which a State is a party,
jurisdiction, original jurisdiction shall be in the United
States Supreme Court."

It was that second limitation that

was argued in that case.

The question was when it is a State

statute that is attacked, through the Attorney General or
through the State's personal representative, is it the State
that is being attacked or is it the individual?

And the

majority in the opinion —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume there

at 1 o'clock, Mrs. Sears.
(Whereupon, at 12 noon, a luncheon recess was

)

taken.)

5
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1; 01 Pom.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Sears, you may

Continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ORETTA D. SEARS ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MRS. SEARS:

(Continued)

What I was trying to, or attempting to,

point out is that in a very real sense what Ex Parte Young
did was to take away a suit against the Attorney General of a
State or a State officer in which the declaration

or a

statute is being attacked for unconstitutionality from the
original jurisdiction provision inherent in the Constitution
which states that whenever a State is a party to a proceeding,
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is original jurisdiction.
It was to remedy this particular ill that in 1911
the original three- judge court provisions were enacted.

I

think probably the clearest showing of the intent of Congress
at that time to provide full direct appeal in all of those
cases where the decision was to be made by the three-judge
court and where a finding of unconstitutlonality was had, is
found in the original provision in the 1911 provision in which
the three-judge court which was sought to be empaneled was
intended to be made up of at least one jud^e plus two additional
judges, at least one of whom was going to be either a
Supreme Court judge or a circuit court judge.

6

Now, quite obviously, once a decision has issued
from a three-judge court, at least one of whom but possibly
two of whom are Supreme Court judges, it would be rather
incongruous at that point to go to a circuit court to have that
decision removed.
Now, true, today the Act has been modified so that
it does not any more say at least one of whom can be either a
Supreme Court judge or a circuit court judge, but it does
still say at least one of whom — and again at least one of
whom — shall be a circuit court judge.

Arguably, therefore,

one could have a three-judge court with two circuit court
judges.

I suppose one could go to the Ninth Circuit and demand

a hearing en banc, but I would question the wisdom of trying
to overrule a two-judge court decision with two judges from
the Ninth Circuit sitting on it and deciding the case.

It

would make it somewhat incongruous.
That is one of the points.

The other point is that

interestingly enough, the Act does not say prohibit.
defines injunction within the Act.

It

It says, an injunction to

restrain the enforcement, and so on and so forth.

The word

"restrain" as this Court has recognized does not mean just
prohibit.

It means anything less than an actual prohibition.

It means anything which makes it difficult, which inhibits.
I think this is true of the First Amendment cases and of all
cases.

It is certainly true that it will

for

7
indeed that is what declaratory judgment is, is a restraint,
especially in view of some of the new decisions which have
stated that —* I believe it was the Second Circuit or the
Third Circuit stated that after a declaratory judgment a
proceeding against the person contrary to the declaration of
unconstitutionality was automatically an action which was in
bad taste.
Now,had I read that opinion, I would have been a
lot more cautious before ever bringing a State proceeding
after the declaration of a three-judge court.

So long as that

opinion exists, I am restrained in the future from ever doing
it again even though in good faith I believe I am right, I
still couldn’t.

So it is a real restraint.

Finally, if we speak about a ca3e in which a threejudge court is properly convened and if we had a valid request
for injunction and if the request for injunction is denied
but the declaratory relief is granted, what are the results?
The practical result is that the State who is the one that was
Sought to be protected, whose procedures are sought to be
speeded all the way to this Court, will be the one defendant
that will not be able to reach this Court directly.

Whereas,

if the relief had been denied, all of it, and the Act is
uhcdnstitutional, the defendant, the individual, will be able
to come directly to this Court.
was not intended.

And I think this inconsistency

I think that a declaration of unconstitutional

8
ity, unless this Court is willing to say that beyond 1201
we take 1202 and destroy it, it is there, a court who has the
power to issue a declaration also has the power to enforce
that declaration under 1201, and probably within the purview
of 2283 as well.

And it seems to me that then in that case

we have a bypassing of the totality of the procedures.
Now, a point that is also scmewhat important is the
fact that there is another restraint that is possibly res
judicata restraint.

Now, that, too, is a restraint because

if the State court feels, if the people feel that the
declaratory judgment is going to be res judicata in the State
court, there really isn't much point in bringing the
proceeding.

So therefore, I would submit that if we are

going to allow a declaratory judgment to be given in these
cases, and I think we have to, I don't
question,

think that's open to

then I think the courts must preserve the right to

appeal by declaring that a declaratory judgment is per se
in this type of cases injunctive in that it restrains,
The second point, of course,
as.far as

is that both of these —•

the first order, the order to return,

obvious under my rationale that it is injunctive.

it is
But the

second order is probably even more injunctive, to my mind.
It opens me to a contempt which I almost find inescapable.
I cannot in good faith — that's the impossibility, in good
faith do that which I do not believe in.

How do I in good

9

faith petition my court whom I have asked to do something and
who has issued a valid order and has rendered a valid judgment,
now I have to go back and say, "I don't believe I’m wrong, but
it
they tell me I have to do/in good faith, so,your Honors, I will
do it."

QUESTION?

You are talking about the second order.

MRS. SEARSs

That’s correct.

This type of a situation puts an immediate burden
upon the individual and upon the Office of District Attorney,
rh California the District Attorney is an elected official.
In California the District Attorney shall file all complaints.
If a complaint, the people of the State of California under our
constitution have a right to have the discretion of the
District Attorney exercised and my

..

says

I shall attend the court, the Superior Court, the trial court
on behalf of the people.
How can I go into one of those courts representing a
party, not the people?

And in this case, if I go in and

petition, I would be representing a party, not the people.
QUESTION;

The District Attorney — there is one

District Attorney in each California county?
MRS. SEARS;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
Elected by the people for what, a four-year

term of office?
MRS. SEARS:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice White.

10
QUESTION:

And the deputies and the assistants are

appointed by him?
MRS. SEARS:

That's correct, and act only in his

name.
Those are the considerations that I felt were
probably most important.

I do realize that there have been

problems, procedural problems, numeral problems.

A petition

was filed under rule 60, noticed, however, for July 1.

I

have read as much as time and physical limitation allows as
many of the opinions, and I came to the conclusion that the
rule part of the problem did not seem to be so acute.

Perhaps

I am wrong, but I felt that since the case is here totally
and there is nothing more to be done downstairs, in any event,
I did not feel that I need go too much into that point.

If

tdie Court feels that I should, I will address it more
specifically.
Now, the one point that I would like to make is
the facts of this case.
four search warrants.

The State court magistrate issued

I as the head of the Writ and Appeals

Section automatically direct my deputies.

They were issued

over a weekend, however, or a Thursday or Friday and a
weekend interfered.

On Monday I felt very strongly that the

mandates of this Court require an immediate hearing as soon as
possible.

And I felt very strongly that under rule 41

analogy, rule 41 and 1538.5

..

are almost identical,

11
if not identical, in scope and language.

And I know many cases,

Second Circuit cases, other cases, that have held that rule 41
does allow the court to have that kind of a hearing at the
instance of the District Attorney.

So I asked for that kind of

a hearing.
The defendants in the State action, in that hearing,
arose and said, "Begging your pardon, Court, you have no
jurisdiction.

Good-bye."

Well, at that point we proceeded with the hearing.
?

Probably wrong, I feel very strongly that that kind of issue
belonged in the State court and that the court in granting
relief actually showed itself prudently
in the courts to do their job, the State courts.
if we are ever going to have a

of decision.

I tried again, and again they came in and said, "Begging your
pardon, but we don't feel bound by this court."
I think the hearing of August 12 which has been
brought up as part of the record by the appellees is graphic
of what has been happening.

The Federal court in that case,

although it did not pursue the issue further, asked the
defense, the plaintiff's counsel, why didn't you appeal?

Don't

California would have gone your way?

And that is part of the problem.

I will submit that

this type of action does frustrate the relationship between the
courts# especially when you have proceedings in the municipal
courts at the same time.
Now, there are many factual points that counsel has
made.

I don't think they are relevant.

First of all# they

are points of California law and they are points that should
have been made in the State court but were not made.

I don't

know under what provision he has a choice to argue the
validity of a search warrant either prospective or already
issued before a Federal court rather than before a State court.
I have found no case that indicates that this is the law.
Perhaps I have overlooked something.

plot for a Gilbert and Sullivan parody on the administration of

hope to outline them a little more fully.
address myself to two problems;

I would like to

First, the application of the

doctrine of the cases of Younger v. Harris to this matter,
since the three-judge court felt that this was not that type
of case; secondly, I would like to address myself to the
question of harassment which the court found without a hearing.
Let's start as Mrs. Sears did.

On Friday, November 23,

a magistrate, a California municipal court judge, issued
three warrants.

In each instance on sufficient affidavits and

twice on the viewing of the films involved as to their obscenity,
a practice under California law which indeed was followed out
by a case brought in Municipal Court, which counsel for the
plaintiff here instituted.
QUESTION;

The magistrate had himself viewed the

film?
MR. SMITH;
two occasions.

Yes, your Honor.

That's correct, on

And this is the procedure under California law

14
which is designed to protect the defendant and particularly
protect the possibility of a First Amendment right»

He cannot -—

in California an officer may not seize a film as obscene on an
arrest.

It must be pursued to a search warrant.
Secondly, the magistrate cannot issue that warrant

without either, one, personally viewing the film or other
material, or, two, without an affidavit that is specific in
terms of the nature of that material.
On Saturday, a fourth warrant was issued, and in
each instance, the warrant recited that there were differences
in these films.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Same title, though.
Same title, but different

On Monday the 26th, the District Attorney instituted
a proceeding which has been characterized variously as
injunctive, restraining, whatever, but a proceeding quasi­
criminal in nature designed to lead to an order of seizure of
these films.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

That was a statutory proceeding?
No, it is not.

law on that, I think, is unclear.

It is not.

But California

That's quite correct.

But

the point is that under the procedure as alleged in this
complaint, the defendants here, Miranda, Walnut Properties,
Pussycat Theatres, had an opportunity to come into the
Superior Court of California and raise every objection that

15
they made in the Federal district court — the constitutionality
of the State statute, the validity of the procedures in that
court, the validity of the seizure, the validity of the — the
question of the identity of the film.
raised the obscenity question.
that proceeding.

Indeed, they could have

They refused to take part in

They appeared and contested the jurisdiction

of the court and walked out.
QUESTION;

And the ultimate object of that proceeding

would have been the permanent, what, the destruction of the
film?
UR, SMITH;

No, indeed.

It resulted in the seizure

of those films and held at the Pussycat Theatre.
QUESTION;

As ancillary to some other proceeding or

as an end in itself?
MR. SMITH;
difference.

Either way I don't think it makes any

The question presented here.

There was an

adversary hearing offered under this proceeding prior to the
f: ; ’
_
.J
restraining order issued. There are questions of California
law I concede, but that is precisely why the Federal court
should have abstained, precisely why.

All of these questions

could have been raised in the appellate courts of California,
including the Supreme Court of California.
Finally, of course, they make a complaint that is
completely unfounded.

They refer to some abatement cases.

It

is correct that our courts have held that the red light abatement

16
action is not applicable to film, it's only live conduct.

But

of course they don't point out that the California Supreme Court
has before it now a case involving the nuisance type of
injunctive proceedings under 270 of our penal code, nuisance
section.

The Los Angeles Court of Appeals in Los Angeles for

the Second Appellate District held the procedures utilized by
the Los Angeles District Attorney to be proper under California
law.
Two weeks ago our Supreme Court granted a hearing in
that case.

Some of the very issues that they raise here.
Finally, tv/o days after this hearing, of which

counsel walked out, they filed a complaint in the Federal court.
The allegations are that this proceeding that we have just
discussed violated their rights.

Secondly, they complained

that the seizures pursuant to the warrants violated their
rights.
Immediately prior to that, of course, complaints were
filed against the theater manager of Pussycat Theatre, the
managers who were exhibiting the films.
A hearing was held before Judge Lydick,

the Federal

district court judge, on the temporary restraining order, and
he determined that there was no bad' faith, no harassment, that
the officers had acted pursuant to valid State warrants.
However, ■—
QUESTION?

Mr. Smith, somewhere can you straighten

out for me the juxtaposition of Judge Ferguson and Judge Lydick?
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

I'm glad you raised that.

The case wa3 originally assigned to Judge Ferguson.
And the record reveals that he refused himself on the ground
of possible bias.

It was then assigned to Judge Lydick who heard

the request for a temporary restraining order.
Now, on December 28, 1973,he issued an order denying
the temporary restraining order and finding no bad faith, finding
no harassment, finding no irreparable injury.
He did,however, and we suggest in our brief that he
erred, because he found that the question was not fully without
merit, some substance, some perhaps Federal question.

But he

also determined that the question of abstention, he felt, was
■

■

a question for the three-judge district court.

•

.

We feel at

that point he should simply have denied the action, dismissed it.
The appeal here would have been

to the Ninth Circuit court.

Of course, if he were wrong, it would have been back to the
three-judge district court.
QUESTION:

He certified the necessity for the three-

judge court.
MR. SMITH:

Correct.

We suggest he erred, in spite

of the correctness of his decision overall,procedural error.
However, the order appointing

the three-judge

district court did not include Judge Lydick, the district judge
to whom it was assigned.

18
QUESTION?

And who certified.

MR. SMITH:

And who certified.

Rather, it was

assigned to Judge Ferguson, another U.S. district court judge,
and a circuit court judge and a third judge.
We raised the question that that is jurisdictional
under the statute.

I prefer not to devote any additional

time to that question.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Why not?
Why not?

Because I feel that there are

maybe I misjudge when I feel there are more critical issues
in the case.

We feel that we have a right to have, we feel

it is important and we have raised it, but we feel that we
have a right to have the district judge who heard this matter
sit.

Indeed, if it's referred back, obviously to whom do you

refer it?

That's a very good point.
QUESTION:

I am just wondering what basis do you

have for criticizing it?
MR, SMITH:

The statute is very explicit.

It says

it shall include the district judge who certified the matter,
before whom the case was brought.
QUESTION:

That's all I wanted to hear you say.

I was just wondering why you didn't say it.
QUESTION:

»id you ever object to the three-judge

court that was actually convened, that you thought there had
been a jurisdictional error?

19

MR. SMITH;

I can't say that we did, no.

I don't

believe the record reveals that we did.
QUESTION;

Hov; do you think this came about?

Chief

Judge Chambers surely knows what the statute says.
MR. SMITH;

Well, I think it came about, if you

look at the proceedings on December 6, 1973, six days after
this action was filed, you will

notice that this same panel

was assigned a number of consolidated cases, and in those cases
they discussed abstentions, California statute.

There were a

number of cases, seven or eight involving other counties in
California and other defendants and other plaintiffs.
QUESTION: Also obscenity cases?
MR. SMITH;

Also obscenity cases.

Apparently they

were assigned, apparently by the Ninth Circuit, to handle these
issues.

That's the only explanation I have.
QUESTION:

If you prevail on this point, you win your

lawsuit, don't you?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, and we urge it and we urged it in

the briefs.
QUESTION:

Are you going to touch on the question ox

Judge Ferguson's change in position about the refusal?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think it speaks for itself.

think he certainly was biased when he refused himself.

that.

I think it improper.

I don't wish to infer beyond

20
QUESTIONS

Well? it's not unheard of that a judge has

a misapprehension about whether or not he owns stock in some
company or whether or not he thinks he may know soma of the
persons involved and it turns out to be another person by the
same name.
MR. SMITHs

That was not so here.

If you will notice,

the order of refusal, it refers specifically to the fact that he
has knowledge of and is acquainted with and otherwise biased
with reference to the parties in this action.

It happened to

be officers of the city of Buena Park who were some of the%
defendants here.

And you may draw the inference that the bias

was perhaps in their favor.

I suggest that that may not be the

correct inference to be drawn on the record in this case and on
the record incident to which refusal referred.
QUESTION;!

Isn't it conceivable, too, that a judge

figured you could have come to me or one of the other fifteen
judges of the Central District and say, "Possibly,I am biased,
I won’t sit."

Then it goes up and is certified by the Chief

Judge of the Ninth Circuit, comes back and says you and you
and you will make up this court.

Well, the thing is a little

further along the road at that time.

You might take another

look and say, well, in those circumstances, as long as Judge
Chambers has said, 1 am going to sit.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That’s possible.

Apparently he did.

Mr. Smith, what is your position as to

finding by the district court of harassment?
MR. SMITH:

The district court, Judge Lydick, the

three-judge district court?
QUESTION:

The three-judge court.

MR. SMITH:

The two-judge court simply recited the

facts with reference to the warrant and said they speak for
themselves.

Judge Lydick, of course, found that this was good

faith execution of a lawful warrant by a judge, a magistrate
in a California court.
I think that that question of harassment does deserve
extended discussion here.

To begin with, of course, the burden

is upon the plaintiff to establish it.

It must be by clear

and convincing evidence, because the presumption under Feeder
and all of the cases is presumption of validity and proper
action by the State officers.
The recitation of these facts that I have just recited

in reference to the search warrant is the only basis apparently
for the three-judge court's determination of bad faith.

It's

simply the enforcement, in our view, of good faith, the performance
of a duty by the officers, a duty compelled by the statute in
California by the valid warrant in California, the valid
enforcement of our State law.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, was

there any hearing on

this issue of harassment?
MR. SMITH:

No, excepting to the extent there was a

22

hearing on the TRO by Judge LydicJc prior to the convening of
the three-judge court.

He held a hearing and he found good

It was submitted to the three-judge court on the

affidavits before Judge Lydick.

That question is expressly

submitted.
QUESTION:

Are you saying, Mr. Smith, that the three-

judge court which now did not include Judge Lydick overruled —
MR. SMITH:
Correct.

That's precisely what I am saying, yes.

That's precisely what happened.
QUESTION:

Well, they had more to go on.

They had

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

No, indeed.

The very same affidaits.

The same affidavits.
The same, in fact, the counsel were

present before Judge Lydick and argued the matter.

The same

No, they held no hearings of any

kind or character.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
the opportunity to

They didn’t hear counsel at all.
No, they did not.

They did offer counsel

present additional affidavits and additional

materials, but no additional material was in fact presented.
Now, what evolved in this question of harassment is
another question of State law and procedtire which was presented
to the State court, because you know meanwhile back in the
State court the proceeding is going on.

The complaint was

23
filed against the employees of Pussycat Theatre.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Criminal complaint.
Criminal complaint.
When was that filed in relation to the

date of the filing of the Federal?
MR. SMITH:

The criminal complaint against the

employees was filed prior to the Federal action.

The criminal

action with reference to the plaintiffs here was filed — it
v;as signed three days before -- it was in January to be
specific, January 9,and January 14 it was filed, it was three
days before service of the summons on the District Attorney.
It was filed the day after.

It was signed two days before.

But the proceedings were held in the meanwhile under
our statute, the 1533.5 or rule 41 procedure, to suppress the

those two counts.
QUESTION:

Were they different prints of the same

MR. SMITH:

No, they were the same title, but they

were different —
Apparently what happened was, as pointed out here
at page 48, that what they did as in another instance came out
with what they call a soft version first and the warrant was
issued.

I want to make it clear that,these records make it

clear that,the procedure in Orange County is that after one
seizure on the same film that the procedure is to be the
issuance of a citation for every subsequent violation and not
an additional search warrant and seizure.

However, the people appealed.

And they went

I would like to read in connection with, I think,
the basic issue here one portion of the proceeding on August 12
in the appendix here before Judge Ferguson, sitting presumably
as a member of the three-judge district court.
The question present:

Have you taken that order up

to the California Court of Appeals?

Referring to the order

here of seizure of the additional copies, this quasi-criminal
action.
QUESTION:

And referring to the State court of

appeals in San Diego.
MR. SMITH:

In San Diego.

He said, the answer by Mr. Brown:

No, we have not.

Why not?
Because, your Honor, initially back in November when
this first occurred, the day after the hearing, we filed a
complaint in this action, this Federal action, and one of
the bases for relief alleged in the complaint was the depriva­
tion of

constitutional rights.
He goes on to say that once we had invoked the

jurisdiction of this court properly, we sought relief in this
court, and we did not protest the matter further in the
California State courts.
At that point he says, the judge asked him:

When

you go half-way shouldn't you be required to go all the way?
Referring to the same proceeding.

Mr. Brown said;

MR. SMITH:

I am reading from the transcript of the

proceedings of August 12, 1974, before Judge Lydick.

Is that filed here in this Court?
Yes, it is. It's not in the appendix, I'm

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

My question was is it filed?
Yes, it is filed.

It is part of the

record in this Court, but it's not the printed appendix, is what
I wish to say, because the appellees here requested this be
made part of the record and it was not part of the original
printed record.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY FLEISHMAN ON
BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. FLEISHMAN:
the Court:

I will

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

address myself to the district court

holding in which the court declared the California obscenity
statute as construed by the California court unconstitutional.
Mr. Rosenwein —
QUESTION:

Would you address yourself to the question

of the personnel, the composition of the three-judge court?
Are you going to get to that?
MR. FLEISHMAN:
Mr. Rosenwein’s domain.
QUESTION:

Oh.

MR. FLEISHMAN:

Yes, your Honor, although that is
I know that and I can and I will.
Very well, we will wait for him.
No, I will do that, because I was

there.
The way we do it in California, your Honor, is you
file a case and you draw by lot a judge.
Ferguson at that time.

We drew Judge

At that time we had a complaint in

which we asked for injunctive relief and for money damages.
Judge Ferguson stated that he had been the city attorney of
Buena Park where all of this occurred, that he in fact had
founded the charter of the city and did not want to do anything

29

that would seem improper under the circumstances.

And therefore

he refused himself.
Subsequently, after the three~judge court was
convened, we withdrew from our complaint all requests for
money damages so that damages were then out of the case.

And

within that framework, where there was no longer being any
money asked against the chief of police whom Mr. Judge Ferguson
had previously represented, Judge Ferguson felt that there was
then no longer any reason for him not to sit.
QUESTION:

In the interim had Judge Lydick come into

the case?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Yes.

it was assigned to Judge Lydick.

When Judge Ferguson withdrew,
But then, as I say, the

complaint was amended to withdraw from it the money damage
aspect, and again in this connection, Judge Chambers selected
the court and gave to the parties an opportunity to object if
they had any objection to the composition of the court.
objection was filed at all.

No

So Judge Ferguson was in fact the

correct judge, it had been assigned to him in the first
instance by lot, and whatever objection there had been in the
first instance by reason of the fact there were money damages
no longer existed once we amended our complaint.
QUESTION: And then the court ended up Ferguson, Lydick
and Ely?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

No, it was Ferguson, Ely, and East.

And Lydick was out.

MS. FLEISHMAN:

case.
QUESTION:

No, that's not my question.

Chief Judge Chambers.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Justice Brennan, is —
QUESTION:

Under the statute may he do that?

It

may require to assign the certifying judge.
MR. FLEISHMAN:
QUESTION:

I think not, your Honor.

I see.

I guess we will have to decide

that in this case, won't we?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

That may be a question, although I

hope that in deciding it, your Honors keep in mind that
Judge Ferguson was drawn by lot.

Judge Ferguson was no stranger

to this litigation at all.
QUESTION:

But he was drawn by lot as a single judge,

31
was he not?

=

MR. FLEISHMAN:

And under the three-judge court

statute, then he should be one of the members of the threejudge court.
QUESTION:

But when he refused himself, there may be

a question of whether he was not out of the case then for all
purposes, and when Judge Lydick came in, then the authority
had attached to Judge Lydick.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Is that not a question?

Yes, it is a question, or answer to

the question, as I have indicated.
QUESTION:

Well, you rely also that no objection was

made when opportunity was given.
MR. FLEISHMAN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

For both side3, I gather, to object

when the panel was composed.
MR. FLEISHMAN:
QUESTION:

Exactly, your Honor.

If it's jurisdictional, that would make

no difference, would it?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Ordinarily jurisdictional questions

are not waived, although that is not a universal rule either.
If I may go to the substance of the question, Mr.
Justice Marshall, because Mr. Rosenwein will handle all of the
procedural problems.
The important question on the substantive question is
whether the specificity requirement announced by this Court in

32
Miller ju3t two years ago has any continuing viability.

Miller

held, as we read it, that to meet due process requirements a
statute must specifically enumerate a carefully itemised list
of various forms of sexual conduct the depiction of which may
be prohibited.
Mr. Justice Brennan expressed the sentiments of the
Court, I believe, when he said that under the Both Memoirs test
the situation had become intolerable, not only because it
makes bookselling a hazardous profession, but as well because
it invites arbitrary and erratic enforcement of the law.
There were other problems arising out of the vagueness
of the law of obscenity.

Appellate courts, including this

Court, had been forced to act as a board of censors and nobody
was pleased with that position.

Law itself came into disrespect

because courts v/ere acting arbitrarily in this area of
obscenity because nobody knew what it was.
It was against this background that Miller was
decided and by a five-fco^four vote it was decided that it
was possible to define obscenity in a manner which would at
the same time afford protection to First Amendment material
and give fair notice to those subject to its provision.

Four

of the Justices, of course, felt that it was impossible to do
this and that 16 years of experience had demonstrated beyond
question that obscenity was in fact not a definable concept.
N,\

Now, it is important, as we see .it, to remember that

33
at the same time that this Court abandoned Roth Memoirs as
unworkable, as indeed as being vague, the Court set in motion a
test which

it

thought would cure the vice.

QUESTION:

We held in

.. we have not said in Miller

that Roth Memoirs was vague, didn't we?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

I read that as saying that Roth Memoirs

with the Miller specificity read into it was not vague.

I have

always read Miller and indeed Hamling as saying that a statute with­
out

specificity in it did not meet due process requirements

which Miller said was necessary.
QUESTION:
itself.

You don't mean written in the statute

You mean construed.
MR, FLEISHMAN;

the attack

Construed, oh, yes.

I don’t mean —

here is not that it is not in the statute.

body can see that it's not in the statute.

Every­

But what was involved

here is that even as it was construed by the California courts
there was no itemised list of sexual conduct.
QUESTION;

Indeed —

Where has there been an itemized list in

the construction of section 1451 by this Court?

There hasn't

been.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Well, the A and B that have been

given as plain examples of the kind of materials.
QUESTION:

But there has been no itemised list.

And

surely the courts in California have as much freedom in
administering an obscenity statute written by the California

34
legislature as this Court does in administering one written by
Congress.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

I haven't any doubt about that.

The

problem is this, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in Hamling this Court
read into the statute the A and B given in Millar.

In

California the court of appeals in Enskat said, "We don't
engage in that kind of judicial legislation.

We will not read

into our California statute something that the legislature did
not put into it."

So that there was no attempt made in

Enskat which is the authoritative case decided in California
after Miller was decided, there was no attempt there to say
we are going to put specificity into the law if it was not
otherwise there.

So that there is no question but that if

the California courts had chosen to give specificity to the
statute similar to the kind of specificity that your Honors
gave to 1461 by reading Miller into 1461, it would be an
entirely different case.

But here the California court conceded

that it didn't have — really conceded that there wasn't the
requisite specificity either in the statute or in the prior
decisions.

And what they said in Enskat was you don't need

that kind of specificity because California retains in its
law the Memoirs utterly without redeeming social value test,
and because that Memoirs test was retained, the Enskat decision
said there was a fair trade-off.

We got more than the

Constitution requires, having the Memoirs value test, therefore,

35
we didn't have to get all that we were entitled to under Miller.
So that the question comes back to the fact that the statute
on its face plainly is defective, it does not have any
itemized sexual conduct, and the decisions that existed in
California at the time that Bnskat looked at the statute did
not have particularization.

What we have in California are

generalisations, not particularizations.
court said in Bnskat.

And this is what the

They said, for example, that Miller

was satisfied because in California we have a hard core
pornography test because it has been ruled previously that
only graphic depictions of sexual conduct could be reached
and because nudity without sexual activity would not be deemed
to be obscene.
Those are the guidelines.
QUESTION;

Is that any less of a guideline than our

construction of 1461 in the Reels
MR. FLEISHMAN;

case and Hamling?

I would say so,

if Miller's require­

ment of specificity, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

We said in Haialxng, and Miller wasn't

a legislative drafting then, you didn't have to do exactly what
Miller had said.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

No, but you also had said that Miller

was a constitutional requirement, as a constitutional require­
ment, that due process required that there be specific sexual
conduct itemized either in the statute or by judicial construction.

36
Otherwise, I submit, your Honor, that the attempt to cure the
vagueness by Miller was nothing at all.

It was a mirage.

Because in other respects, in every other respect, Miller
made the obscenity law more vague, not less vague.

For example,

in Miller we shifted from national standards,which were
generally thought to be applicable,to local standards.
local standards are less certain and are more vague.

Now,
In Miller

the requirement that the prosecution come on with expert
evidence to prove its case was withdrawn, rendering it possible
for findings of fact, judge or jury, to make determinations
based on personal predilections rather than some kind of
objective standard.

In Miller there was a shift to the jury

as the board of censors instead of having an appellate court
acting as board of censors.
Now, it's true that boards of censors, be they
appellate courts or juries, are not in high esteem.

The fact

of the matter is that censorship by jury is less certain', it's
less predictable than censorship by an appellate court which
everyone can look to and know what the law is.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fleishman, Enskat or a similar case

has not yet been taken by your Supreme Court?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

As a matter of fact, after this

Court had taken this case, and I have called it to the Court's
attention, just about two or three weeks ago the California
Supreme Court has taken a case called People v. Nisslnoff .

37
where that issue is finally coming up to the —
QUESTION;

What court has decided that last case?

MR. FLEISHMAN;
intermediate court.

Klsslnoff was decided by another

Enskat has been decided by a court of

appeals in Los Angeles, and Hlsslnoff was decided by a court
of equal level up north.
QUESTION;

Did the Nigsinoff court follow Enskat?

MR. FLEISHMAN:
QUESTION;

Exactly.

I see.

So the Enskat issue is now before

the supreme Court of California?
MR. FLEISHMAN;
QUESTION;

Exactly.

That hasn't been argued?

MR. FLEISHMAN;

That has not been argued.

Now, after and only after the California court
construedits statute and found that it did not violate
constitutional requirements, did the district court consider
the validity of the California statute as it was cons-iurued by
the California courts.

And in rejecting the Enskat argument

that had been the requisite specificity, the district court
said exactly what I was saying to you a moment ago, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, that all that Enskat said was that the statute reached
hard core pornography, graphic depictions of sexual activity,
and did not reach nudity without sexual activity.

The court

said, quite properly so, that the cliche "hard core pornography"
added nothing.

Hard core pornography has ail the vagueness that

38
we find in the term "obscenity."

The district court quoted
?

the statement made by Chief Justice Warren in Jacobelias
where Chief Justice Warren stated we are told that only hard
core pornography should be denied the protection of the First
.Amendment, but who can define hard core pornography with
any greater clarity than obscenity?

In the case of

?

Commonwealth v. Horton , a case where the highest court in
Massachusetts declared the Massachusetts obscenity statute
unconstitutional in light of Miller, the same argument was
made.

It was argued before that court that in Massachusetts

only hard core pornography could be condemned, and the court
ruled that's a mere cliche,

that doesn't mean anything, and

struck down the Massachusetts statute.
Similarly, the district court found that the
requirement of graphic depictions of sexual activity clearly
did not meet the requirement of some kind of a list which
would give some kind of guidance to everybody so that you
would know if it was this, you were in the-troubled waters,
and if it wasn't that kind of conduct, you were not in trouble.
The court pointed out that there were many acts of sexual
activity that may even be utterly without redeeming social
value which are so innocuous as not to be included on a list
enumerated by a legislature.

Examples come to mind, of course.

Since in California we say that it's nudity with sexual activity,
the question comes to mind, Can you reach a nude couple kissing

39
mouth to mouth?

That would not seem to fit the plain examples

that we find in Miller, and yet it would fit the general
language of the California statute.

One thinks in terms of

kissing toes, fingers, nose, neck, ears,hair, breast, all of
which under the plain examples of Miller \*ould not be covered
and yet which could be covered under the general language that
we find in the statute*
Now, the Attorney General takes the position out
front and says that we do not need a blueprint, we do not need
a blueprint of sexual activity.

To use the language of the

Attorney General, Miller's demand for specificity does not
require a detailed statutory enumeration and description of
all of the types of sexual activity sought to be protected.
Such detail is not required under law.

And then we are back

again, would Roth without Miller read into it satisfy the
due process requirement today in light of Miller?

And I

submit with all deference that Roth without Miller read into it
is unconstitutional under the Miller rule.
And then the Attorney General says, relying on a
statement of this Court that the Constitution does not require
ultimate God-like precision, he says therefore it is unnecessary
that to avert the Constitution's infirmity of vagueness, the
statute must recite a detailed blueprint of the proscribed
conduct.
So the question that we have here is when concededly

40

the Stats statute does not have any itemised list and when
concededly the prior decisions of the State court do not have
any itemized list and where the State court does not seek to
correct the statute in any fashion because the State court
recognises that is a legislative function and not a judicial
function, whether under those circumstances the statute was
correctly found to be unconstitutional as it was by the
district court.

And we believe that the court plainly was

correct in its conclusion.
The court stated, the district court stated, that
this Court in Miller sets forth important First and Fifth
Amendment principles central to a fair and reasoned system of
criminal law when it insisted that an obscenity statute have
an itemized list of the types of sexual conduct that may be
reached under the obscenity laws.
We respectfully submit that unless that portion of
Miller is to be overruled, the district court was plainly
correct in its conclusion. And I would say to your Honors that
if that specificity portion of Miller is to be overruled, then
we are worse off than we were before when this Court said that
Roth Memoirs had created a state of chaos because then we would
have even more chaos than we have had before.
Thank you, your Honors.

41
ORAL ARGUMENT OP SAM ROSENWEIN ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLEES
MR» ROSENWEIN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My responsibility is to take care of the procedure.

I do think that perhaps it ttfouid be helpful to make a statement,
a very brief statement of the facts which appear to have been
overlooked by my colleagues on the other side.

And they are

simply this:
What happened here was that in the city of Buena Park
there came the news that "Deep Trouble" was going to be shown
in that city.

Unwilling to have that film shown in the city,

the District Attorney sent two officers to look at the film
in Hollywood where it was showing and had shown to over 800,000
patrons»
.

•

They viewed the film, came back, and prepared an

v .

affidavit which stated — all typed up — which stated that they
saw the film, watched it for 16 minutes and it was nothing but
one sexual act after another.
anything else.

No mention is made of theme or

That's what they saw.

They then presented that to a Municipal Court judge
and with the judge together with the officers proceeded to
the theater in Buena Park,

They want in and saw the film.

The findings of the district court below is that they stayed
there 45 minutes, did not wait to see the entire film, came
out and in the street the judge directed the issuance of the
warrant, and at the same time where a cameraman was taking a

42
photograph of the scene ordered that the film be taken out of
that camera because the municipal court judge was performing a
judicial function.
Now, after that they proceeded to seise the film* and
this was now at about the first showing on November 23, 1973.
Two hours later another print of the film is at the
theater and it's being shown.

They had been told by the

District Attorney, Look for any difference, any difference at
ail, and then you can get another warrant to seise it.
QUESTION:

Who is "they”?

MR. ROSENWEIN:
QUESTION:

The police officers.

They had been told.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

They had been told by the District

Attorney.
QUESTION:

They who had been told were the —-

MR. ROSENWEIN:

Police officers.

The police officers

had been instructed before they went out, this is in the record,
they had been instructed, Look for any difference and then
seise'.
They now take the same affidavit.

They go and view

the film now, assumedly now for the 60 minutes.

They view the

film now and use exactly the same form, the same typed form
that they had originally with respect to viewing the Hollywood
film, and then they write in themselves in their own handwriting,
"Your affiant further states that said film was seized" —-

43
QUESTION s

What page are you on?

MR. ROSENWEIN:

I am on page 5 of my own brief, but

that actually also appears in the findings of the court.

You

will find that in the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.
Anyway, on page 4 and 5 of my brief we recited the findings.
In fact, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
I should point out that at the first seizure, they
not only seised the film, but they took out of the cash box
all the receipts of that day, $305.

Then they come back and

write, "Your affiant further states that said film was seised
on November 23, 1973, at approximately 1:30 p.ra. after being
viewed by Judge Smith," was the name, "with the exception of
certain portions being edited different than the first film
seised.

Your affiant states that this copy of the film "Deep

Throat" consists of (1) additional acts of sexual intercourse
and numerous small changes at different portions of the film."
Whether this was a second, a minute, one doesn't know.
had checked 60 minutes of nothing but sexual acts.

They

The first

time they looked at only 45 minutes, and now they are saying they
found one more.

That is a finding of the district court.

Having seized those two, there is now a third film.
Your Honors will recall, of course, the decision in Heller v.
New York, of which, of course, my colleagues were entirely
aware.

My colleagues who cannot do some things in good faith

and go to the courts, et cetera.

In any event they come with

44
a third warrant new and they seize the third one.
they put in their affidavit?
a change.

And what do

Exactly the same language.

Hot

They don't even say the third is different from the

second.
QUESTION:

That's because the conclusion was after

viewing it that the pictures were essentially the same.
ME. ROSENWEIN:

The pictures were the same and they

had not seen anything additional.

I am going to come, Your

Honor, finally to their concession that they were identical.
But I just want to point out here —
QUESTION:

I hope you are going to give some time

to whether or not we have jurisdiction of this case and whether
Younger should have been followed.
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Well, let me just say, and I will come

to it.
QUESTION:

I gather these things are all irrelevant

if we decide we don't have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

Yes.

But these four seizures were

all done, we say, of the identical film, and in addition some
month or two later at the criminal trial and pretrial
proceedings for the purposes of the trial, they conceded that
these films were identical and they needed only one.

There

was therefore here a massive seizure, the theater was closed
after the fourth seizure.

There was a massive seizure before

any prior adversary hearing, clear violation held.

45
And now /our Honor's question is?
QUESTION;

What is the appeal here from?

What

QUESTION;

May I emphasize what Mr. Justice Brennan

order?

is asking?

There seems to be a great desire on the part of

both sides of the counsel table to avoid this issue.

Will

you direct yourself to it.
MR. ROSENWEXN;
beginning, then, on that.
Ferguson by lot.

Now, let me start this from the
You have the selection of Judge

You have him then refusing himself.

Now, I

want to make clear that he didn't refuse himself because he was
biased.

That is an implication there that is really unfair.

What he did say, you will find it on page 20 of the record,
all he said was that he had been a city prosecutor in Buena
Park, had helped to organize.

And the chief of police there

was someone who he had helped appoint.

Now, the chief of

police was a defendant in this case.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rosenv/ein, if I may tell you what

bothers me.
MR. R03ENWEIN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

This is a direct appeal from an order

to this Court, and if it's properly here, it's because there
was some kind of injunctive order below.

Was there or wasn't

there an injunctive order below?
MR. ROSENWEIN;

There was an injunctive order, but

46
I don't think — I say literally there was, of course, an
injunctive order.
QUESTION;

I am speaking of the two orders from which

this appeal is taken,
MR. ROSENWEIN:

There is only one really before the

Court, I think, the amended judgment.

QUESTION;

Why not?

There was a pending, as I

understand it, at least at the time of any order in the threejudge court, there was a pending criminal proceeding, was there

Then came the Federal

Six weeks later, six weeks later, after service of

the complaint, they amended to include these two appellees.
QUESTION:

Right.

But it's after that before you had

the first judgment order of the three-judge court.
MR. ROSENWEIN:
QUESTION:

I think that’s correct.

And meanwhile there had been additional

tv

proceedings involving these appellants in the State court?
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Yes, but those had nothing to do

with the problems that were then in the Federal court.
QUESTION:

Why do you say in that circumstance that

Younger does not apply?
MR. ROSENWEIN:
follow Steffel, we had

Well, for this reason:

First, if we

filed first,our complaint filed for

these two appellees was filed first.
In the second place, the predicate for Younger has
t

always been that one could get a disposition of the case in
the State court on some question of construction of the State
law which might not be clear.

Here Enskat, they came into the

district court and said Enskat has decided this.
QUESTION:

May I suggest I don't understand Younger

48

that way.

This is not the classic abstention situation in

which a construction of the State statute might avoid a
Federal constitutional question.

That's not the circumstance

to which Younger is limited, is it?
MR. ROSENWEIN;

Well, we couldn't have — I'd say,

relegating us to that court would have not resulted

in an

answer to the constitutional — it would have been just one way.
Enskat governed all courts at that time and they said so.

They

said so.
QUESTION;

You could have petitioned for a hearing

to the Supreme Court of California if the San Diego Court of
Appeals had decided against you on your constitutional claim,
couldn't you?
MR. ROSENWEIN;
QUESTION;

Which case are you referring to?

Well, had you taken your case up through

tile California court system, you say that the court of appeals
would have decided on the basis of Enskat.
MR. ROSENWEIN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

But you could have then asked the Supreme

Court of California for a hearing if you had lost in the court

You could have petitioned this Court if you had

MR. ROSENWEIN;

Yes, but I assume one could say that

one could go through the entire situation again, but Enskat
had just been decided, the defendants, the appellants here had

And moreover the court found, there was a finding made by the
three-judge court that this was a deliberate attempt —

Mr. Rosenwein —

MR. ROSENWEIN:
QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sorry.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

I was going to say the three-judge

court found it was a deliberate attempt to circumvent —
QUESTION:

With an exception.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

They wanted to circumvent the

jurisdiction of the court.
QUESTION:

You mean there was a finding of harassment

within the Younger exception, is that what you mean?
MR. ROSENWEIN:

No.

I mean there was a finding that

the filing of this amendment to their criminal complaint to
include these appellees six weeks after they had started their
action was intended in bad faith to circumvent the jurisdiction
of the Federal court which we had invoked.

And we had invoked

simply a violation of the Heller rule, the Heller opinion.
Now, we are entitled to the return of our three films.
That's what's before this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fleishman has told us that some other

litigant has succeeded in getting the Enskat issue before
the California Supreme Court.

Had you proceeded through the

50

Court of Appeals, X guess it would be the same Third Division,
would it, the Los Angeles Division?
MR» ROSENWEIN:
QUESTION :

Yes.

Then perhaps you might have succeeded as

did this other litigant in getting Enskat before the court.
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Mr. Justice Brennan, here is our

You have an Enskat decision there.

You

have all these people coming in and saying this is the binding
law,

we understand to be the binding law. I might say, a

petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed prior to the
recent taking of thi3 case and was denied by the Supreme Court
citing Enskat and Hamling.
Now, everybody — now, I agree that the courts can
always change their mind.
QUESTION:

This Court has itself •-

I gather you are suggesting that means

your Supreme Court is going to follow Enskat.

But then you

would come here, wouldn't you, or try to get here?
MR. ROSENWEIN:
months ago when we

were there before the district court, they

had a clear situation of an attempted circumvention. It had

an Enskat case that/the binding law everybody agreed that it
was.

And we had filed our complaint first and had invoked

the Federal court's jurisdiction before.
QUESTION s

You suggest that the Younger doctrine

is limited to where the case law, or where State courts

haven't decided the Federal question that is in the case.
But if the State courts have already taken a position on the
Federal question in the case, you may ignore Younger.

Is that

it?

one of the reasons.
QUESTION:

No.

What I am saying is that we had

No, no, it wouldn't be a question of bad

because they have already decided the issue.
MR. ROSENWEIN:
reasons why

We simply said that one of the

it would be purposeless for the Federal court to

relegate us back to the State court is you've had a ruling
from the State court today, yesterday, which says our statute
as we construe it is constitutional.

Now, there the Federal

court, what is the Federal court to do?

They are asked by

appropriate plaintiff who says to them, under the Civil Rights
Act of 1871,Congress has passed a law, the law of the United
States and the supreme law of the land,

we claim a violation

of our constitutional rights, and we ask that there be a
declaration that this statute is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

This was a 1983 suit?

MR. ROSENWEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was a 1983 suit.

Mr. Rosenwein, did your original application

ask for a three-judge court?
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Yes, it did.

52
QUESTIONS

It did?

MR. ROSENWEIN:
QUESTION:

Which judge asked for it?

Judge Lydick certified.

Well, the statute says that on the finding

he shall immediately notify the Chief Judge of the Circuit. T&at
was Judge Lydick, right?
MR. ROSENWEINs
QUESTION:

Yes.

Who shall designate two other judges to

MR. ROSENWEIN:

mandatory, and I consider it directly not mandatory, but —

A non-mandatory statute.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

Situation — I tell you what the situation is, it's in the
record.
QUESTION:

"Who shall" is not mandatory.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

Shall and may, as your Honor knows,

very often vary in meaning.

But my point simply is we have had

a number of three-judge court actions pending at the time, and
I think as a matter of judicial economy the Chief Judge
decided that he would refer to the three-judge court Judge
Ferguson, Judge Ely, and Judge East,and put in there if there
is any objection to it, let yourself be known.
never been any objection.

And there has

The first time they have raised it

53
is here on appeal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenwein,

from your associate's posture?

are you departing now

I thought that he took the

position that under the statute it was Judge Ferguson to whom
the application for injunction or other relief was originally
presented.
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Yes.

Well, I think that would be

another reason why it was appropriate for Chief Judge Chambers
to appoint Judge Ferguson as one of the members.

Without

objection, unless it would be considered mandatory, and I've
never considered — I can visualize judges

becoming ill,

judges being incapacitated for one reason or another.
QUESTION:

That’s one I have never heard of before.

I know I haven't been on any court too long, but I have never
heard of a three-judge court that didn't include the one who
asked for it.
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Yes, I think that is true.

I think

in mo3t cases that is true.
QUESTION:

I assume it’s because of that statute.

MR. ROSENWEIN:
followed.

Yes, that would ordinarily be

But unless it's mandatory, I would not conceive it

as something.
Now, X just wanted to say counsel on the other side
spoke of the declaratory relief action as being injunctive in
character and therefore this Court has jurisdiction and made

54
a complete argument concerning Ex Parte Young, et cetera.

But

I have understood from decisions like Young and Mitchell and
others that this Court had decided that if only declaratory
relief was handed down by a three-judge court, that was
appealable to the Court of Appeals.

And I might say that, in

this case where questions of harassment and bad faith and so
on are being mooted on© way or the other, the mediating effect
of a Ninth Circuit opinion might have been very helpful.

But

this Court has decided that the mere declaratory relief is
not enough to warrant an appeal.
Now, that's all we really have in this case.

All we

have is declaratory relief plus the direction to proceed to the
municipal court who have had stipulations before returning all
the money.

Over $5,000 was seized.

And who would assumedly,

if they asked, would say in the light of the district court's
direction that the Heller violation was palatable would direct
it to be returned with ...
QUESTION;

(Inaudible.)

MR. ROSENWEIN:

Yes, it is.

This Court has said

that 1253 is the kind of statute that should not be literally
construed, that there may be cases where it would be helpful
for judicial economy, et cetera, to permit the appeals to go
through the Ninth Circuit.

I think this is one.

If this Court

should decide not to take jurisdiction, of course, it's a
matter really of discretion and policy whether this case involving

55
basically the return of the three films is —
QUESTION;

Did I understand you to say it's a

matter of discretion whether we take this case?
MR. ROSENWEINs

Well, 18in

..

at least policywise that one could say that we would not take
this thing because this is not an injunction that restrains
the enforcement of a statute because of its unconstitutionality.
QUESTION:

Nevertheless, I should think on the face

of the facts, unless there is an injunctive order, we have
no jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

And if there is and if it was a three-

judge court that was required to be convened, then we do and
must.
MR. ROSENWEIN:

You have jurisdiction, but I thought

from the cases there have been indications that you could if
you wanted to refer it to the circuit court.

Nevertheless,

despite all that, if the Court decides to take jurisdiction,
our argument is that the district court below, and properly,
decided that it could consider this case, that this was a
situation, the Steffel situation, a situation of bad faith in
that the subsequent amendment was intended to circumvent the
jurisdiction —
QUESTION:

That situation was one in which there was

no criminal proceeding pending.

That's within an exception.

MR. ROSENWEIN:

Exactly.

Harassment.

And in

adversary proceeding so-called in which they went, form shopped,
to a judge in Orange County, a Superior Court judge who had
no jurisdiction, no statutory references.

California, as this

Court well knows, has only one way of trying an obscenity case,
and that's a criminal trial.

There is a specific provision

that you cannot condemn any property, any so-called obscene
material, until there has been a final affirmance of a
conviction.

They proceed to improvise this kind of a proceeding

and get the order restraining us entirely from showing the
film,clear prior restraint, and then proceed to say we are
holding a hearing in which

Now, is that bad faith or harassment?

He didn't have the evidence that in the criminal

trial two months later they stipulated, they stipulated that

Now, if they

need only one, your Honors know under Heller v. New York that's
all they are supposed to have.

We are supposed to show the

film thereafter until they have a criminal trial and convict
us.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenwein, at what stage did your

Heller argument in the Federal court turn into an attack on
the constitutionality of the California obscenity statute
itself?
MR. ROSENWEIN:
just say this:

Well, when you say that.

Let me

When we came there, when we came originally

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have two minutes left

Mrs. Sears.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ORETTA JD> SEARS
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MRS. SEARS:
please:

Mr. Chief Justice/ and may the Court

I wish to answer by referring the Court to certain

passages of the appendix that I think the Court may have been
wondering about.
In the appendix at page 82 shows the reason why we
were not able to object to the three-judge court composition.
We were notified on February 8 of the existence of the threejudge court, and the three-judge court order designating it,
which is found on pages 84 and 85, is dated January 8 and gave
us two weeks from the January 8 date to complain about the
three-judge court.

I found that was futile to attempt to do

anything about that.
Number two, the appendix at page 89 shows that of
course we did not have an evidentiary hearing because we were
ordered to submit affidavits and points of authority then
without oral argument.

As a matter of fact, I have never

seen -the three-judge court ever.
never seen it.

I know it exists, but I have

59

magistrate's affidavit.

That is the

Pages 76, 77, 78, and 79 of the

appendix show the true status as to the stipulation of the
identity of the pictures.

There was a stipulation for purposes

of trial only.
Page 45 of the appendix shows that which has been our
consistent policy in these cases, one seizure,

and subsequently

an adversary hearing.
And one more thing that I wish to correct.

Counsel

states that the court in the district was bound by Enskat.
Only in the superior court, only in the municipal court.

We

are in the Fourth District Court of Appeals*: Enskat

in the

Second District Court of Appeals has persuasive value.

It is

not binding on the Fourth District Court of Appeals.

They
\

could have gone that way.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Sears, you said, if I understood you,

that you had never appeared before or even seen this threejudge court.
MRS. SEARS:
QUESTION:

That i.s correct.
Did any counsel for Orange County have that

privilege?
MRS. SEARS:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
There was no hearing of any kind, no

argument of counsel?
MRS. SEARS:

No, sir.

60

QUESTION:
MRS. SEARS:

Were briefs filed?
Yes.

By order of the court on March 2G

we were notified that the matter would be submitted upon
affidavits,

the issue of harassment would be submitted upon

affidavits and the issue o£ the constitutionality of the State
statute was on briefs, and that was it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

The case is

submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:31 p.m., the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
