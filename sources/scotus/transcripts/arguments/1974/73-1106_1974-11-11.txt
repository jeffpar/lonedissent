MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We511 hear arguments

first this morning in 73-1106, Cousins against Wigoda.
Mr, Whalen, you may proceed whenever you9re ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE W. WHALEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WHALEN:

Mr. Chief Justige, and may it please

the Court:
This is an unusual case.

-It arises out of the

seating of delegates to the 1972 Democratic National Convention,
and which of two competing delegations should be seated in
Miami.
The State of Illinois held a primary on March 17,
1972, in which 59 respondents were elected as Delegates to
the 1972 Convention.
On March 31st, 1972, ten petitioners filed a
challenge in accordance with the rules of the Democratic
National Party, contending that respondents had violated
national party rules, and that they had discriminated
invidiously and substantially on the basis of race against
women and young people, and that they had held secret and
closed slate-making meetings? all in express violation of
the national party rules.
On April 19, 1972, the respondents filed a complaint
in the Circuit Court of Cook County, alleging that respondents,

4
because they were elected in accordance with State law, were
the only delegates who could be seated at the 1972 Convention.
Petitioners sought to remove that case to the
Northern District of Illinois Federal Court. The motion to
remand the case was granted on the grounds that no
constitutional or federal question was presented by the case.
Petitioners also sought to enjoin the action in the
State court, pursuant to Section 1983.
An injunction was issued for.a time but was subse­
quently vacated by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and a
stay of the Seventh Circuit Court was denied by Mr. Justice
Rehnquist in chambers.
Pursuant to the national party rules, on May 31st,
June 1st and June 8th, 1972, hearings were held in Chicago
at which both respondents and petitioners participated,
presenting argument, filing motions, presenting witnesses and
documentary evidence, all before a Hearing Examiner appointed
by the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Cecil F» Poole.
On June 25th, 1972, Mr. Poole issued a report in
which he upheld the allegations of petitioners, and that is
that respondents had discriminated invidiously and substantially
on the basis of race and against women and young people.
He also found that respondents had conducted closed
and secret slate-making meetings, in violation of national
party rules.

5
And he also found that respondents had no rules for
governing their procedures, although that, too, was required
by Democratic National Party rules.
QUESTION: Who are the respondents?
MR. WHALEN: The respondents are the 59 delegates
elected in accordance with the Illinois Election Code.
QUESTION:
MR. WHALEN:

The delegates themselves.
They were the delegates that were

elected according to the Illinois law, that’s correct.
QUESTION:
MR. WHALEN:

Right.
In late June 1972, petitioners held

caucuses throughout the City of Chicago, in which they
selected an alternative Delegation. The delegates, the
candidates for Delegate, who had been on the ballot on March
17 but which had not violated the National Democratic Party
rules, selected an alternative Delegation, essentially the 59
petitioners in this case.
On June 30th, 1972 —
QUESTION:

Do the 59 petitioners include any of the

59 respondents who were elected?
MR. WHALEN:

No, they do not. AH the 59 respondents

were found to have violated the national party rules, Your
Honor.
On June 30th, 1972, after a highly publicized and
intense debate before the Credentials Committee of the

6
Democratic National Party, the Credentials Committee ruled to
seat petitioners and not to grant respondents credentials to
the 1972 Convention,
The Credentials Committee expressly rejected
respondents’ claim that State law exclusively governs the
selection of delegates to the 1972 Convention.
A minority report of the Credentials Committee,
favoring respondents' position, was filed with the 1972
Democratic National Convention.
On Monday, July 3rd, 1972, respondents filed an
action in the Federal District Court for the District of
Columbia, in which they sought to reverse the decision of the
Credentials Committee.

They alleged that they had been

elected in accordance with State law, and therefore were
entitled to be seated.

They also alleged violation of consti­

tutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
On the same day, July 3rd, the Federal District Court,
Judge Hart, dismissed respondents' complaint.
Now, the Credentials Committee had also voted to
unseat the — part of the delegates which had been elected in
accordance with the California Primary law, and to seat in its
stead a delegation selected by appointment of the presidential
contenders, other than Mr. McGovern.
That delegation, the unseated California delegates,
also brought an action in Federal District Court, and their

7
complaint was also dismissed by Judge Hart»
On the 4th of July, the day after the dismissal by
Judge Hart, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
combined both the California and the Illinois cases for oral
argument.

Oral argument was heard on the 4th of July, and on

July 5th, the Court of Appeals issued its ruling.
The Court said, and expressly approved the resolu­
tion of the Credentials Committee seating petitioners and
unseating respondents.
To protect its jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals
also granted an injunction to prohibit the Illinois respondents
from proceeding in any other court.
On the same day, the respondents petitioned this
Court for a writ of certiorari and for a stay of the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia decision.
On the evening of July 7th, 1972, this Court's
opinion issued, granting a stay of both the Illinois and the
California decisions of the Court of Appeals, but also
expressly denying — expressly refusing to act on respondents'
petition for a writ of certiorari.
The following evening, July 8th, respondents peti­
tioned the Circuit Court of Cook County for an injunction, to
enjoin the petitioners from participating as the Delegates
from the Chicago Districts in the 1972 Convention.
Petitioners did participate in that Convention, and

3
after a hard-fought political battle, after which numerous
eompormises were offered and rejected by various parties, the
1972 Convention upheld the ruling of the Hearing Examiner and
the holding of its Credentials Committee, that respondents had
violated national party rules, and that national credentials
should be awarded to petitioners and not to respondents.
On August 2nd, 1972, briefly after the Convention was
over, respondents again went to the Circuit Court of Cook
County and sought an injunction against petitioners, from
participating in the selection of national committeemen and
committeewomen from Illinois.
On October 10th, 1972, this Court remanded the case
of Keane v. National Democratic Party to the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia.
And on February 16th, 1973, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia found that the National Convention had
acted within its competence in granting its credentials to
petitioners and refusing the credentials to respondents.
The Court of Appeals found the case moot, but none­
theless affirmed the decision of Judge Hart, dismissing
respondents' complaint.
On September 12th, 1973, the Illinois Appellate Court
affirmed the two injunction orders of the Circuit Court of
Cook County.

The Illinois Appellate Court found that Illinois

law was exclusive and Convention rules and national rules were

9
of no effect# and that the Illinois law exclusively governed
the election of delegates to the Convention# and the Convention
was ttfitheut power or authority to refuse to seat them *
The Supreme Court of Illinois declined to review the
Illinois Appellate Court decision.
QUESTION;

Under Illinois law# did that delegation

at that stage have any authority or power other than the
election of the members of the National Party Committee?
MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;

That was the —
Or had all of their other functions

expired?
MR. WHALEN: All of their functions had expired,
with the exception of the power to select the National
Committeemen and Comraitteewomen.
QUESTION:

Is the — are the delegates then discharged

once that function is performed?
MR. WHALEN:

No# they’re not. They still continue

to hold office# as delegates to the —■
QUESTION;
MR. WHALEN:
QUESTION:

Until the next Convention?
Until the next Convention.
Or the next primary# which — if the

Illinois law is operative# I take it there will be another
primary for the selection of delegates?
MR, WHALEN: There will be another primary# Your
Honor# but our position is that a person is not a delegate

10
until lie’s been granted the credentials by the appropriate
authority of the national party.
QUESTION: Well, what I5m trying to get at is that if
the Illinois Appellate Court is correct, then, under Illinois
law, there will be another election, will there not, of
delegates?
MR. WHALEN:

The Illinois Appellate Court simply

sustained the injunction of the Cook County Court, which
prohibited petitioners from acting in any way as delegates.
QUESTION:

Or holding themselves out as delegates?

MR. WHALEN: But the respondents r~
QUESTION: Act as delegates only until they are
replaced, under Illinois law, by another election; isn't that
true?
MR. WHALEN:

That's correct.

QUESTION: And that will be when?
MR. WHALEN:

The next Primary election will be in

March of 1976.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

I thought you said until another election

and until that election had been acknowledged and approved by
the National Party Convention?
MR. WHALEN:

If I didn't say that, I certainly meant

to imply that, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

In the meantime, the people elected are

II
merely delegate-designates ~~
MR. WHALEN:

By the State of Illinois.

QUESTION: And they remain in that posture until their
credentials are accepted by the Convention.
MR. WHALEN:

On the other hand, the petitioners are

the certified delegates to the Convention and have the
credentials, which have been granted by the national party.
QUESTION:

Mr. Whalen, we have certainly taken

jurisdiction of some cases where there's been an appea* from
an injunction without any contempt citation, where the party
has yet to disobey the injunction, and we've taken jurisdic­
tion of cases where a party has disobeyed an injunction and had
a contempt citation or contempt penalty imposed on it.
But I'm a little bit troubled about the posture of
your case.

You have had an injunction issued against your

clients, your clients have disobeyed the injunction, so the
injunction didn’t frustrate anything they wanted to do.
And there's a possibility of contempt proceedings against them,
but, as I understand it, no actual contempt penalties have
been imposed on them.
MR. WHALEN: There are two injunctions involved, Your
Honor.

One injunction is the August 2nd order, which

currently restrains petitioners from acting as delegates in
selecting national committeemen and committeewomen.
the August 2nd order

That's

12
QUESTION s

Now, what practical effect does that

injunction have on your clients at this time?
MR. WHALEN:

It is preventing the clients from

holding a meeting, selecting a national committeeman and
committeewoman from Illinois, and presenting them to the
Democratic National Committee.
QUESTIONS

Well, what — does that come up every

two years?
MR. WHALEN; That comes up under national party rules
as a duty and responsibility of the certified delegates from
each State.
QUESTION;

Well, the national committeeman or

committeewoman, then, doesn't have any particular term?
MR. WHALEN:

It's a four-year term.

QUESTION: Well, when was — when were they elected
last in Illinois?
MR. WHALENs

Respondents participated in an. election,

because petitioners were enjoined, on August 5th, 1972.

So the

term of national committeeman and committeewoman from Illinois
will run from the National Convention in 1972 until the end
of the National Convention in 1976.
QUESTION: And by that time there will be new delegates
by anybody's rules, won't there?
MR. WHALEN:

That's correct.

QUESTION: Well, I gather, then, that the national

13

committeeman's post is filled now?
MR. WHALEN:

It is, Your Honor.

QUESTION; And ccmmitteewoman?
MR. WHALENs

It is filled —

QUESTION s And' did the National Committee accept
those elections by respondents?
MR. WHALENs
We

It accepted them subject to challenge.

the petitioners were unable to challenge because they

were enjoined by the Cook County Court.
QUESTIONS Well, let's assume that you win this case,
what will happen with respect to the National Committeeman
and woman?
MR. WHALENs

The petitioners will hold a meeting,

which they were enjoined from holding by the August 2nd order?
%

they will select nominees for National Committeemen and
Committee'.-/omen, and present them to the Democratic National
Committee.
I might say that the July 3th order, 1972, is, in
our judgment, still has some force in that the trial judge in
Cook County has deferred any action on the contempt proceedings
until such a time as this Court has had an opportunity to
rule.
Petitioners respectfully submit that all the
proceedings in the Cook County Court after the July 5th, 1972,
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,

14
were barred by clear and unambiguous principles of res judicata.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
expressly held, first, that all the parties in the federal forum
were the same as all the parties in the State for mi.
Secondly, the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia expressly approved the resolution of the Credentials
Committee seating petitioners and unseating respondents, and
granting petitioners National Convention Delegate certificates.
QUESTION;
MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;

Mr. Whalen, —
Yes?
—■ if I may go back to the matter of the

committeeman and committeewoman, you say they were elected by
the 59 respondents — when?
MR. WHALEN:

On July 5th, 1972.

QUESTION: And that was before the National Convention,
was it?
MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;
MR. WHALEN;

That was after the —
Oh, that was after?
Oh, I ■— it was August 5th, 1972.

QUESTION: But after the National Convention?
MR. WHALEN: After the National Convention.
was —

And that

the National Party -QUESTION: Are they now seated by the National

Committee, in office?
MR. WHALEN: They are seated subject to challenge.

15
QUESTION: Subject to challenge before whom?
MR. WHALEN:

The Democratic National Committee.

QUESTION: Well, has the National Committee permitted
them to participate in the National Committee?
MR. WHALEN:

Yes, they have.

QUESTION: Subject to challenge?
MR. WHALEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And when is the Committee going to rule

on the challenge?
MR. WHALEN: The Committee can't rule on the challenge
because the petitioners are currently enjoined from bringing
it.
QUESTION:

I see.

I thought this case was moot.

Maybe I hoped so!

[Laughter.]
MR. WHALEN:

I might say, Your Honor, that it's a

continuing, reoccurring question, which inevitably will arise
at the last minute, just as this case did.
QUESTION:

With Democrats, it sure will!

[Laughter. ]
MR. WHALEN:

I said before that the Court of Appeals

for the District of Columbia expressly held that all the
parties were the same.

It also expressly approved the

resolution granting petitioners credentials and denying
respondents credentials.

16

It further held that respondents' State court claim
was to be rejected, and if it were to be considered that there
would be an impairment of the First Amendment rights of
association.
This Court " expressly refused to grant respondents'
petition for writ of certiorari.

And under unambiguous law, a

stayed but unreversed judgment is res judicata,, and an
absolute bar to subsequent proceedings.
For this reason, we respectfully request that the
judgments below should be dismissed.
For over a hundred —
QUESTION:

What of the consequent vacation by the

Court of Appeals of its judgment?
MR, WHALEN: The Court of Appeals did not vacate its
judgment. Justice Rehnquist.

On October 10th, 1972, this Court

vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded the
case to the Court of Appeals for a determination of whether the
case was moot.
So, at the time that both orders were entered by the
Cook County Court, July 8th and August 2nd, the judgment of
the Court of Appeals 'was outstanding but stayed.
QUESTION: Would you concede that after the vacation
of the judgment of the Court of Appeals by this Court that that
judgment was no longer in effect?
MR. WHALEN: That judgment was no longer in effect at

17
that time, but then, on February 16th, the Court of Appeals
acted again on remand from this Court, and at that time the
Court said that the Convention had acted within its
competence in seating petitioners and refusing credentials
to respondents? and, further, it affirmed Judge Hart.
Under the Munsingwear decision, the affirmance is
important, because that decision holds that even though the
case was found to be moot, that .Keane v, National Democratic
Party* continued to have a res judicata bar.
For over a hundred and fifty years, the National
Parties have met in quadrennial conventions to select their
nominees, and citisens from the States have brought
credentials challenges to assert principles ranging from
party loyalty, racial discrimination, basic principles, silver
or gold, or oftentimes just to establish a true National
Republican Party or a true National Democratic Party.
And credentials challenges are the proven and
historic means for citisens, in exercise of this First Amend­
ment activity, to uphold Party principles and to assert the
rights of the National Party.
QUESTION: Are there any cases in the State courts
other than the two that you mentioned in this period, in
which the power of the National Conventions to seat their
own delegates, pass on credentials, have been questioned?
MR. WHALEN: The two reported cases were the McQueen

18

case and the Houser case* which are in our brief, —
QUESTION: Any besides those two?
MR, WHALEN:

Mr, Chief Justice, you're aware of

the loxver court decision in the State of Georgia, which
purported to pass on the credentials of the — which was the
lawfully elected delegation from Georgia,
QUESTION:

Did that go to the Supreme Court of

Georgia, or was that in the intermediate and lower courts?
MR. WHALEN: That was in the intermediate and lower
courts.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WHALEN:

That same year there was a decision

by the trial court in Mississippi, on a Mississippi challenge
to the Republican National — in the Republican National
Committee.
In 1972, in the Riddell case, there is a decision
in which the Federal District Court in Mississippi held that
the loyal Democrats not selected in accordance with State law
could be seated at the National Convention, and the regular
Democrats elected in accordance with State law were properly
excluded.
The interests of a State are, in large part, at odds
or could be at odds with the interests of the National
Democratic Party.

This has certainly been true in the area

of Party loyalty; it's been true in the area of racial

19

discrimination.
QUESTION:

Mr. Whalen, what is the ■— what5s the

federal question here?
MR. WHALEN;

What's the question of federal law?
Your Honor, the complaint, by its

terms, does not raise a federal question. And indeed that
was established by Judge Will in the Seventh Circuit on
respondents8 motion to remand.
The federal question from the point of view of
petitioners is at least threefold.
First of all, our basic rights of association have
been violated by the injunction —
QUESTION;

By the State of Illinois, you say?

MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;

By 'the State of Illinois.
Unh-hunh.

MR. WHALEN;

Secondly, we think that the privileges

and immunities clause guarantees us as citizens of the United
States the right to participate in the national process.
So we believe that our rights under the Fourteenth Amendment
have been bridged by the injunction.
And thirdly, we think that this process is inherently
national in nature, and if any State could abridge the rights
to participate in a - National Convention, the National Party
would lose its effectiveness.
QUESTION; Well, that's the same as your first point,
your first and second.

20
MR. WHALEN;

I think that's right —

QUESTION;

I mean the National Chamber of Commerce

is national in nature? and the State presumably can't inter­
fere with the right of those people to associate.
MR. WHALEN:

That’s right.

What we had in mind there

were the interests which this Court has expressed in cases
such as Shapiro v. Thompson? Nelson v, Pennsylvania? where —
the City of Burbank? where there is a national interest at
stake, and therefore —
QUESTION;

Not a federal governmental interest, —

MR. WHALEN:
t

That’s it.

* .

QUESTION:

-— is that what you say?

It’s a private

associational interest, is it not?
MR. WHALEN:

It is a private associational interest?

but to the —
QUESTION:

Of course, the Court of Appeals, I know,

held it was governmental.
MR. WHALEN: But if there’s to be any regulation, it
certainly has to be federal, it couldn't be State.
QUESTION: Do you feel you have a fundamental right
to travel to the National Convention?
MR. WHALEN;

We certainly do, but I don't think that

that’s what's at stake here, because the injunction order did
not prohibit u.s from traveling by its terms, it simply pro­
hibited the petitioners from presenting themselves as delegates.

21
QUESTION:

Your basic claim is that the State of

Illinois, through this injunction, has interfered with your
First and Fourteenth Amendment right of association, is that
it?
MR. WHALEN:
QUESTION:
MR. WHALEN:

That is correct, Your Honor.
Outside of the State of Illinois.
Yes.

If the law were any different, on the eleventh hour
of every Convention State courts of general jurisdiction
would be issuing injunction orders in accordance x^ith State

law, which would affect the outcome of the National Conven­
tions .
As Judge Will pointed out in his decision, this is
obviously an intolerable result.
QUESTION:

But xtfhat you’re suggesting also, I

suppose, that Conventions have no business -— or political
parties do have the business of saying hew delegates to their
Convention could be elected, if they are going to be given
credentials?
MR. WHALEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And as a matter of' —

You could say, I suppose, according to

you, that the Party could say:

Delegates must be chosen in

the Convention process rather than by election.
MR. WHALEN:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And the Stats has -- would have no business

22

insisting that delegates be elected rather than chosen at
Conventions ?
MR. WHALEN:

That is correct.

QUESTION: Well, as a matter of fact, I gather you
go so far as to say States have absolutely no role to play if
the National — if the Convention sets up the procedures and
methods by which its delegates shall be elected?
MR. WHALEN:
decision here.

I don't think we need to reach that

The National Conventions, as a practical

matter, and indeed in most cases, defer to the State's processes,
just as —
QUESTION:

Well, that's all right, but you say

that's the business of the National Convention to defer or not.
MR. WHALEN;

It might not be if constitutional

questions were presented, which are not involved in this case,
or if there were federal regulation, which is not involved in
this case.
QUESTION;

On the other hand, the Convention has no

business interfering with the State's constitutional preroga­
tives with respect to the selection of Electors.
MR. WHALEN: That is correct, other than —
QUESTION:

But Electors are not involved here, are

they?
MR. WHALEN:

Electors are not involved.

than — to the extent —

And other

23

QUESTION;

Well, the State needn't, I suppose,

accept the Party's — the results of the Party's work at the
National Convention?
HR. WHALEN;

And, as you know, Your Honor, that has

repeatedly happened.
QUESTION;
MR. WHALEN:

Yes.
To support -fche injunction in this case,

the respondents have argued that there is a compelling State
interest.

While -they don't argue that there are any

constitutional rights at stake, they say that the State has
an interest in protecting its election process and to
achieve this protection they would have that an injunction be
issued.
But the effect of that injunction is one of two
things:
First, it would force the National Party to seat
respondents — that's what the Illinois Appellate Court said,
individuals who the National Party has expressly found
violated their most fundamental principles and with whom the
National Party did not want to associate;
Or the second thing would be that there would be
no persons from Illinois seated at the National Convention.
It's not conceivable what State interest is protected
by having no citizens from the State of Illinois, and that was
certainly the interest which persuaded the Court of Appeals

24

for ’the District of Columbia and the Riddell court.
Also that argument ignores the strong national
interests of the Party to associate so it can rally its
members for its nominee to win the November election.

The

argument ignores that.
For these reasons, we would respectfully request
that the judgments below be reversed.
QUESTION:
am I correct

The only impact of the decision here --

as to the immediate situation would be the

identity of the members of the National Committee from the
State.

Is that not the only remaining question?
I'm not talking about what's going to happen in

1976, but presently the only impact of \-;hafc we would decide.
MR. WHALEN;

There is that.

There is also the

problem that if persons wanting to participate in a National
Convention can have injunctions issued against them, and if
the judgments are subsequently reversed, but those individuals
have to stand for contempt, that certainly will chill in the
future any First Amendment rights or incentive to bring this
kind of challenge.
QUESTION:

I was excluding the future consequences;

just the present ones.
The decision of this Court now would decide who ~
which body is going to elect the National Committee members
from the State of Illinois.

25
MR. WHALEN:

It will decide that. The trial —

the Cook County Judge has also deferred any further action
pending review of this case.
QUESTION:

So —

It will also decide whether or not

your clients are going to go to jail.
MR. WHALEN:

That's correct.

QUESTION: That's also future.
MR. WHALEN:

Right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Whalen.

Mr. Torshen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME II. TORSHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. TORSHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the State's
interest is sufficient to enable it to enforce voting and
associational rights of its citizens to injunction proceedings
against certain of its citizens from assuming party offices
to which they were not elected, and from representing a
particular electorate which did not choose them.
The facts underlying this issue have been largely
totally ignored by petitioners, and have not been properly
heard in any court until they were heard in the Circuit
Court of Cook County.
Those underlying facts which give rise to the

26
.injunction, and which were not heard, are the Illinois Election
Lav;, the nature of the election itself, the voter in associational rights of Illinois cifcisens to choose their representa­
tives, and to associate with each other in political parties,
and the findings that were made concerning the nature of the
petitioners’ slate of delegates itself, and the manner in
which they were chosen by the State.
With regard to all of these things, we are here on
a record which is largely uncontested and in which the findings
of fact, which came after two evidentiary hearings, at which
all persons who participated were not objected to.
I would like to dispose, if I may, of the res
judicata argument, because that has taken up a large part of
the petitioners’ brief,

tod in

the context of this case, it

creates a cloud which has to be dispelled.
If anything, res judicata requires an identity of
issues in an opportunity to litigate those issues.
The issues before the District of Columbia Courts,
both the District Court and the Circuit Court, were the
constitutionality of certain guidelines of the Democratic
Party. These included two guidelines concerning the imposition
of quotas and two guidelines which dealt with slate-making
and the endorsement of candidates.
When this came before, the District Court, Judge Hart
specifically refused to hear any questions concerning the

27
legality of the slates chosen in Illinois,, but concerned
himself only with the questions of constitutionality of the
guidelines, holding three constitutional and one unconstitu­
tional, and he refused to issue an injunction sought by the
Democratic National Committee against State Court proceedings.
It should be noted that the original litigants in
that case were the duly elected delegates in Illinois through
a representative and the Democratic National Committee.
Mien the case went before the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia on review, the Court sustained Judge
Hart's finding with regard to the one particular guideline
which he held unconstitutional,
The Court stated specifically, in part two of its
opinion, which dealt with the Illinois challenge to the guide­
lines, that the issue before the court below was the
constitutionality of the guidelines.
The Court then went on, in part three, which dealt
with the Illinois counterclaim, and said;

Because the

Convention is hard upon us, the issue must be decided, not
heard but decided.

And thereupon issued its injunction against

the proceedings in the Illinois Court.
The Court made clear in its opinion that Judge Hart
stated that the legality of the slate of petitioners here
was not before him, but nevertheless issued its injunction,
which liras subsequently stayed by this Court.

28
So that when.the case went back to Illinois, with
all parties present by counsel, for evidentiary hearing, there
had been no finding concerning the legality of petitioners8
slate, and this was the only and precise question presented
to the Illinois Court,
So, in these circumstances, where there were no
identity of issues, no opportunity to litigate, no pleadings
or proof, and no findings concerning legality of that slate,
it seems difficult to us to concede or assume that there was
some res judicata or collateral estoppel effect left over,
after the injunction had been stayed by this Court, at the
time that this Court criticized the District of Columbia -the Court of Appeals decision.
QUESTION;

Your point is, I guess, that the federal

litigation, culminating in this Court's stay, was not. concerned
with the legality under Illinois lav? of your slate, and, on
the other side of the coin, that this case is not concerned
with the constitutional legitimacy of the Democratic Party's
guidelines?
MR, TO.RSHEN;

That's correct, Your Honor.

not at issue in this slate — in this case.

They’re

And, in fact, at

the outset of the hearing before District Judge Hart — and I
should say there were two hearings? the first hearing was held
about ten days prior to that which gave rise to the case which
reached your Court.

Judge Hart's ruling was held to be

29
premature at that time .

Judge Hart specifically instructed

the litigants that he would not hear any questions concerning
the Illinois Election Law or the legality of these slates,
but would concern himself solely itfith the constitutionality
of the guidelines.
QUESTION:

Was it open to respondents to raise the

question of the legality of the petitioners11 slate, before
Judge Hart, in that proceeding?
MR. TORSHEN:

No one raised it.

QUESTION: Well, that wasn’t my question.
MR. TORSHEN:

No.

No, sir.

QUESTION: Was it open to you to raise it?
MR. TORSHEN:

No, sir, Your Honor, it i»/as not open.

QUESTION: Why not?
MR. TORSHEN:

Judge Hart specifically precluded that

question.
QUESTION:

Did you attempt to open it?

To raise it?

MR. TORSHEN: Well, when we came in, Your Honor, we
alleged the bona fides of the respondent group, in other words,
the duly elected delegate, and we alleged —
QUESTION:

But did that imply the lack of bona

fides in the petitioners' group?
MR. TORSHEN:

No.

No, sir.

And we were even

precluded from putting in evidence concerning the nature of
the election in the manner in which we were chosen.

30

So we were held, in the District Court, to very narrow
issues, and these were the issues ‘that went up through the
Court of Appeals, and then were suddenly expanded upon in part
three of the opinion of that Court, which issued the injunction,
I should state the injunction, the complaint for
injunction was, again, not based upon the bona fides of either
of the slates, but only upon the rights of association of the
National Party,
QUESTION;

Now, in the present case, at least as I

understand it, it's virtually conceded that your clients were
the delegates chosen in accordance with Illinois lav/,
MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTIQNs

Not only that, but -I don’t think there’s —* as I understand

it, there’s no dispute about that.

The question is, the basic

question in this case is whether the injunction of the Illinois
State Court violated the petitioners’ constitutional rights
of free association.
MR. TORSHEN;
QUESTION;

Correct, Your Honor.

Is that about it?

MR. TORSHEN;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; And that was an issue that was not really
— was not the issue in the previous federal issue; that's
your point, isn’t it?
MR. TORSHEN;

That’s correct.

It was not in issue,

nor were the facts which might give rise to a decision before

31
the Court.
In that regard, Your Honor, it should be noted that
the Illinois Court found that the Illinois election was free,
equal, open, and nondiscriminatory.

That challenge was never

— that finding was never challenged.
Secondly, **ith regard to tee particular election
with which we’re concerned, it should be noted teat prior to
the fight over the guidelines, there was certainly a great
deal of federal intervention into the Illinois procedures.
For

example, the delegates were chosen from single

member — from districts, congressional districts.

These

districts had been recently reapportioned by a plan approved
by the United States District Court in the Northern District
of Illinois, which enjoined State agencies from acting in any
way to put forth their own plan.

So the districts from which

the delegates were chosen, tea congressional districts, were
established by the Federal Courts

one-man/one-vofee and no

invidious discrimination.
Secondly, the prsons who could chose the representa­
tives for the Democratic Party were also determined by the
Federal Courts in Kusper vs. Pontikes, which voided the Illinois
anti-raiding statute, which provided, then, that anyone could
vote in the Democratic Primary.
This Court, in Kusper vs. Pontikes, subsequently
affirmed that finding and said that the citizens of Illinois

32
had to have the right to associate with other members of the
Party, to choose their representatives.
Thirdly, the Federal Courts, three years earlier,
the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Weisberg vs.
Powell,

determined the method in which persons were to be

placed on the ballot in situations such as this.

It was to

be by lot or hat-draw, if you will, based upon the day that
your application was received by the. Secretary of State.
So here we have a situation in which many aspects
of this particular election, including the District, the
Electorate from which the choica was to be made, and ballot
position was determined by the Federal Court, and it now
appears to foe petitioners5 position here that having done all
this the votes should not be counted, especially after they
concede that the election was free, open, and nondiscriminatory.
We think, Your Honor, that there can be no such
result as that, but that the votes were entitled to be counted,
and that the election was not a charade.
were very clear, anyone could run.
ments.

Anyone could vote.

The Illinois rules

There were minimal require­

And, in fact, they did vote,

There were challenge procedures at all phases of the election
process, and yet not one of the 180 candidates for the 62
delegate positions were challenged by anyone throughout the
election process.
And it's this particular election, this popular

33
election, held under these safeguards, that petitioners here
say must be totally ignored.
We don't think -that that's a result that can be
reached.
And what was the State interest here that they were
protecting?
We have to look to that, Your Honor, again to the
hearings that were held in the State Court, because it's the
only place that such hearings were held, and this concerns
the manner in which the petitioners were chosen to represent
the Illinois Democratic Election,
caucuses.

They were chosen in private

The rules provided that only the lowers in the

general election could vote.
Secondly, strict quotas on race, sex, and age were
applied.
Third, as stated in the Appendix by one of the
District Coordinators, one of the counsel for petitioners,
the rights of the individual voters were to be ignored.
And lastly, again as in the record, developed on
cross-examination from the co-leader of petitioners' slate,
the voters who voted for those persons who won were disenfran­
chised, because their candidates were tainted, as were the
candidates themselves.

So all of these people were excluded

from the election process, and yet sought to represent the
Democratic Electorate of Illinois. And it's against this

34
group that the State issued its injunction.
Now, when I talk about quotas, the evidence is very
clear on that.
For example, the First Congressional District of
Illinois, which encompasses the Hyde Park area, is, in large
measure, black, part white.

And at the caucus meeting held

in a private home it was stated:

All of the delegates elected

must be black, based upon the population, or there coirid be,
at the very most, one white.
Now, anyone who lives in Hyde Park in Chicago shops
at -the Hyde Park Co-op, it’s a large supermarket, and if you
walk down the aisle there past the produce section, it's
quite obvious that there are a large number of Orientals
who live in Hyde Park; persons of Oriental descent.
And one of them asked at the caucus;

May I be

elected?
And the answer was no, you can't be elected;' you're
neither black nor white.
In the Eighth District, where only four persons carae
to attend, it took two votes to determine who the delegates
would be, because the quotas weren't met.
So these were the people, and this was the selection
process that was to be foisted upon the people of Illinois in
connection with the Convention.
QUESTION:

Was this upon the people of Illinois or

35

upon the Democratic Convention?
MR. TORSHEN:

It was upon the nine — I believe it's

nine Congressional Districts involved, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But the question is as to whether they

should be seated, not as to whether they shall be, or how
they shall be elected in Illinois.
MR. TORSHEN :

I think your —

QUESTION; Well, may I finish?
MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTION!

I’m sorry, Your Honor.

Or whether they shall foe seated at the

Democratic Convention.
Now, if I understand - am I correct, that the State
of Illinois can elect a Representative to Congress and
Congress can refuse to seat him?
MR. TORSHEN:

No, sir.

QUESTION : Am I right?
MR. TORSHENs They cannot refuse to seat them.
QUESTION:

oh, they can't?

MR. TORSHEN:

I believe that was Powell vs.

McCormack.
QUESTION:

Oh, no, that wasn’t on seating.

QUESTION:

Haven’t there been a number of occasions

in history when Congress refused to seat a member elected by
a particular district in a particular State?
MR. TORSHEN:

My recollection, Your Honor, --

36
QUESTIONS

Half a dosen or more of such cases.

For example, one that was recently referred to in
one of our opinions, the man elected was a general and he was
refused his seat because he wouldn’t resign his commission.
In another case, he was the United States Attorney, and he
was refused his seat because he would not give up his position
as United States Attorney.
MR. TORSHEN:

He may have been ref vised his seat,

Your Honor, but I don't think people were chosen in his place
by Congress ? but the submission went back to the process
established by the States for the election.

So that I don't

think Congress reached out to choose a delegate.
QUESTION;

I didn't say that.

I said that there were

instances where the State had exercised its rights, —
MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTION:

Correct.

-- and in this case the State exercised

its rights, and I thought the Convention was exercising its
rights,
MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

Isn't that what happened?

MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTION:

And I don't -—
That the —

Yes, sir.
That the Convention refused to seat them?

MR. TORSHEN:
issue before this Court.

Correct.

And we’re not arguing that

I think the issue here, Your Honor,

is whether the Illinois State Court had the power to enjoin

37
certain persons from acting as delegates from specific Illinois
Congressional Districts.
QUESTION ; Even if the Democratic Convention recog­
nized them as such.
MR. TORSHEN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

That's a long-arm statute, really, isn't

it?
MR. TORSHEW: Well, it may be a long-arm statute.
Your Honor, but to say anything else, of course, would be to
negate the idea of popular elections of delegates, nor do I
think, Your Honor, that it's consistent with any great
interest of the Convention. And I think, Your Honor, that that
brings us to this problem of the associational rights that
have been raised hers.
QUESTIONS

Your Point, I gather, with respect to

the purported congressional analogy is that it's not an
analogy, that you're not complaining at all here of the
Convention's refusal to seat the Illinois — your clients?
MR. TORSHEN;
QUESTION;
MR. TORSHEN;

Correct.
At all. That's not an issue here at all?
No, sir.

That is not bafore the Court.

We think whether

Illinois has an interest in its own election laws, which
govern the selection of Party officials, to prevent its
citizens from usurping those laws and acting for represents-

38
tivss of Illinois citizens who did not elect them.
With regard to that, if I might, Your Honor, the
right of association here is not the right of a few individuals
to associate at the Convention with the Democratic National
Convention.

I think the associational rights here, as this

Court pointed out in Pontikes vs. Kusper, are the rights of
the voters to associate with other members of the Party in
selecting their representatives.
And, secondly, to associate with other members in
an election process that here is concededly free, equal, open
and nondiscrirainatory, to select those representatives.
And third, if we must, the right of the State Parties
themselves to associate, through their duly elected representa­
tives, with the representatives of other State Parties', in the
Convention, so that they can choose the nominee for one of
our Major Parties.
QUESTION; What about the question that Mr. Justice
White put to Mr. Whalen, Mr. Torshens

What if the Democratic

National Party decides that we don't want

popularly elected

delegates to our Convention, we want ones just chosen by State
Conventions

is it free to go ahead on that basis, even

though Illinois law says that delegates tc National Conventions
shall be chosen in election?
MR. TORSHEN:

I think they could say tit at. Your

Honor, but I think it would have a serious — would cause a

39
serious change in the nature of the Convention process itself?
and I think what it would do, Your Honor, —QUESTIONS Well, what about an answer to his question?
Isn't it -—
MR. TORSHEN: They could say that.

They could say --

QUESTION? And make it stick.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTION;

Well, they could —
They just wouldn't seat your delegates.

MR. TORSHEN;

Sure.

They —

QUESTION; But your point is, I guess, that they
can't seat anybody else, either.
MR. TORSHEN;
QUESTION;

I suppose that —

Is -that your point?

MR. TORSHEN;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; So that if you concede the right of the
Convention, that they must concede the State’s right?
MR. TORSHEN; We concede the right of the Convention,
I suppose the State would not have to recognize the nominee
of the Convention —
QUESTION:
MR. TORSHEN;
QUESTION;
MR. TORSHEN;

That would be its remedy.
Right.
They say you don’t get a spot on the —
Right.

But I also think, Your Honor,

that if that question were to arise, and it isn’t before the

Court, we would have some other questions to consider.
First, the nature of State action, whether the
Convention itself is State action and whether its

exclusion

and. its method of selection of delegates, who xdlll choose the
nominee of one of our great Parties for President, is a proper
method.
In other words, the Convention isn't a voluntary
association. We don't have to reach the question here of
State action, but it certainly is a great quasi-public body
performing a very, very important function. And for all
practical purposes, the only way in which —
QUESTION:

I gather, then, if we sustain your view

here, or if your view would have been followed in 1972,
Illinois would not have had delegates at the Convention.
MR. TORSHEN:

That's conceivable, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, if it's conceivable, you say that
the Convention had no business seating anybody else.
MR. TORSHEN % Right.

That's correct.

Illinois might

not have had delegates.
And we would submit, Your Honor, that that result
would be preferable to the result which did occur, in which
the Party sought to construct itself from the top up, rather
than the bottom down, by picking out the people who would
represent the Illinois Electorate.
QUESTION'S So you say the State has the — the Party

41
hasn't got the right to say who is going to represent the
S-cate .
MR. TORSHEN:

Correct.

QUESTION; They can reject your delegates, but they
can't do anything else.
MR. TORSHEN;

Correct.

And I think, Your Honor, —
QUESTION;

So that if you have a Convention under

the proposed Party Rules in the State, you could get an
injunction and stop them from going to the National
Convention?
MR. TORSHEN;

If the State's selection system has

not been referred to a State Party, as it has been in some
States, and if the State's selection system is as it was in
Illinois, a popular election, which was free and open to all.
And I think, Your Honor, the —
QUESTION;

My question is;

They have a State

Convention, which the State of Illinois says is not lawful
under the State law.

And they elect delegates to the National

Convention in Podunk, outside the State of Illinois.

The

State of Illinois could enjoin them from going to the
Convention.
MR. TORSHEN;
QUESTION;
get that?

Yes, sir.
How — under what rule of law do you

42

MR. TORSHENs

Hot enjoin them from going there, not

enjoin them from participating, not enjoining them from serving
on Convention Committees; but enjoining than from representing
the Electorate as Delegates, Your Honor.
QUESTION% Well, what does that mean?

They go to the

Convention, they vote in the Convention, but if they say they
vote as a Delegate of Illinois, they violate the injunction?
if they say, "I vote as Joe Jones”, they don't violate it.
MR. TORSHEN:

In the Mississippi challenges earlier,

Your Honor, what the Convention did was create positions of
Delegate-at-large for certain of the members of the Mississippi
Delegation. And I suppose here, if the Convention really
wanted this particular group, they could have created offices
for them.
QUESTION:

But what right dees the State of Illinois

have to control the internal affairs of a National Party
Convention, held outside of the State of Illinois?
MR. TORSHEN:

The State of Illinois, we would submit,

Your Honor, has a right to protect its own election laws and
its own electorate, which participated in an election held
under the auspices of the State of Illinois.

And it could

protect that by issuing injunctions which would prevent
Illinois citizens, within the jurisdiction of its court, from
subverting those laws.
QUESTION:

These men could go down to the Convention •

43
MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

— and vote and do everything that they

wanted to, but when they got back to Illinois, they might
have a little problem of being in contempt of court.
MR. TORSHEN:

That's correct.

They would have the

problem of facing up to the consequences in Illinois. &nd
in this particular instance, Your Honor, so that the contempt
—- the status of the contempt proceeding is known, petitions
for rule to show cause have been issued, the trial judge has
held the case pending the resolution on appeal of the
various issues raised.

So that that case, although not

formally stayed by order, is in fact stayed, really,
awaiting the decision of the ultimate reviewing court?
in this instance, this particular Court.
QUESTIONS

If this hypothetical situation that we

were just talking about, that is, these delegates go to the
Convention in violation of a State Court injunction, take
their seats, perform all their functions, come back, are
cited for and found in contempt, would the traditional
remedies of federal habeas corpus be open to them?
MR. TORSHEN:
Your Honor.

I haven't considered that question,

But I would assume, first, —

QUESTION:

I suppose they would at the time,

wouldn't they?
MR. TORSHEN:

I would think, Your Honor, that not

44
only would habeas corpus be available, but of course there
would be an appeal route from the contempt conviction itself.
If there were such a conviction and a penalty imposed.
The normal appeal procedures would be in effect,
through the Illinois Courts, and I suppose ultimately, on
certiorari, by this Court, if the Court chose to take it, or
if it went that far.
So, certainly the trial judge will not be the
ultimate — will not make the ultimate disposition in this
case.
But the trial judge in this case was concerned,
because the issue was raised in the Illinois Appellate Court
that he had no jurisdiction to act at all, and it5s come up
to tills case,

[sic]

Your Honor, we think that in this particular matter,
the delegates were elected by the people of the State in a
proper and fair election. There was no fraud alleged in tills
election, and there were no challenges.

They had bona fide

credentials to represent the Democratic Electorate.
We do not think that the petitioners had such
credentials, and we think, in the circumstances of this case,
the Illinois Court was entitled to protect not only those
people who voted in the Illinois Primary but those who took
office, and also to protect the Illinois election structure
itself

45
And I should conclude, Your Honors, by stating that
in the Appendix, at page 106, there's a transcript of what
happened at one of the caucuses held by the petitioners,
wherein their delegates or their slate was elected, and in
answer to complaints raised by the assembled citizenry
they said; Raise this question in the State Courts.
And this is precisely what was dona, Your Honor,
and we think it v7ould be reversing the trend of history to
say that the State Courts did not have a sufficient interest
to enable it to protect its own election laws and its
electorate.
QUESTION;

You say 106 of the Appendix or of the

transcript?
MR. TORSHEN:
QUESTIONs

Of the Appendix, Your Honor.

It also says;

raise it in the Credentials

Committee.
MR. TORSHEN; Right.
QUESTION;
MR. TORSHEN;

That’s in the same paragraph.
That's correct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Whalen?
You have one minute left.

46
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE W. WHALEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WHALEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I wanted to address -the question of whether the
exclusivity of Illinois law v/as raised in Keane v. National
Democratic Party.
It was raised, indeed, at all three levels.

In their

complaint before Judge Hart, respondents asked that that Court
declare, adjudge, and decree that the plaintiff and delegates,
respondents, ~~
QUESTION;
MR. WHALEN;

What page is that, Mr. Whalen?
It's on page 9 of our brief.

— have bean duly elected in accordance with the
provisions of the Illinois Election Code, and that therefore
they be entitled to take their seats as delegates.
QUESTION; But you told us earlier, I thought, ~ no
point in laboring this thing very long — that Judge Hart
precluded consideration of that issue.
MR. WHALEN;

Yes, he did, but then it came up

again in the Court of Appeals.
QUESTIONs And the Court of Appeals said no question
of Illinois law is here involved, or words to that effect.
MR. WHALEN:

No, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals

said the challenged delegates claim that the National Party
cannot abridge their rights under Illinois law to have the

47
delegates’ seats for which they have been elected.
The relationship in this case , between the Illinois
law and the Party regulations, offers no ground for relief.
QUESTIONS

Right.

MR. WHALEN;

And then on page 5 of our Reply Brief,

we quote the Court of Appeals, which states;
"The Resolution of the Committee which we have here
approved provides that -the 59 plaintiffs in this suit are not
to be seated as the delegates to the Convention from their
districts in Illinois.

It also provides that 59 other

persons shall be seated as the delegates from those districts."
And in their motion for a stay in this Court,
following July 5th, the same arguments were raised, and the
Illinois Election Law pleaded.
QUESTION; Well, a3 I understand it, it's not even
an argument.

"It's been conceded", or at least virtually

conceded all the way through all of this litigation, that
your adversary’s clients are the delegates who were elected
in accord with the Illinois law.
MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;
MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;

Tliat's correct.
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
There's no argument.

MR. WHALEN; There's no argument on that point, Your
Honor

QUESTIONs Right.
MR. WHALEN;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11;Q3 o'clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
