MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1148/ DeCoteau against District County Court.
Mr. Hirsch/ you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERTRAM E. HIRSCH. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HIRSCH:

Mr. Chief Justice/ and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
Supreme Court of the State of South Dakota.
The issue presented is whether the Act of March 3,
1891/ opening for non-Indian settlement the unallotted and
unreserved lands in the Lake Traverse Reservation, thereby
conferred jurisdiction over Indians on the State of South
Dakota — gave the. State of South Dakota jurisdiction over
Indians«
Since the State of South Dakota has never acquired
jurisdiction in Indian country pursuant to either the .195 3
Act of Congress, Public Law 280 that was mentioned here
earlier, or under the more recent Indian Civil Rights Act,
the Act of zlpril 11, 19(5 8, the issue here really is whether the
1891 Act in any changed the boundaries of the Lake Traverse
Reservation, whether or not the open portions of the
Reservation are still in Indian country.
The facts of the case are really rather simple,

with regard to Mrs. DeCoteau and her two children.
In December of 1971» the State of South Dakota
started dependency and neglect proceedings against Mrs.
DeCoteau» the aim of which was to terminate her parental rights
to her two children, Herbert John Spider and Robert Lee
Feather.
The State was seeking authority to post those
children for adoption.
In August of 1972, the District County Court, before
which this dependency and neglect proceeding was pending,
issued a custody order that continued a foster care placement
for Herbert John Spider and validated a foster care plasement
that wa3 then in existence for Robert Lee Feather.
At that time a motion Was made to the District County
Court judge that the case be dismissed for the sole reason
that the acts, or many of the .acts where the alleged
dependent and neglect occurred, the places where the acts
occurred were in the open portions of the Reservation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kirsch, enlighten me:

particularly relevant?

why is that

I had thought that domicile in an

adoption case 'was the standard, not where the acts occurred.
MR. HIRSCH:
of adoption.

Well, this case never reached the point

In fact, the argument on the merits of whether

or not there was in fact a dependency and neglect situation
had never been completed.

There was never an adjudication of

5
the pendency and neglect,

It was in the midst of that

proceeding on the merits that the jurisdictional objection was
raised.
QUESTION:

I still ask why — why is the place where

the act took place pertinent?
MR. HIRSCH:

Well, it’s pertinent in terms of

whether we are talking here about. State jurisdiction over
the Indian mother and her two children, or whether We are
talking about exclusive tribal jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, does the record show where

she was domiciled?
MR. IIIRSCH:
she was domiciled.

The record

does not show where

The record shows that she is an enrolled

member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, that her two
children are enrolled members, and that, it was stipulated
in the Circuit habeas corpus proceeding that 50 percent of
the acts giving rise to the dependency and neglect proceeding
occurred on federal trust lands, and approximately 50 percent
occurred on lands that were open to settlement under the 1391
Act o
But I might add that that stipulation was made
solely for the purpose of the habeas corpus proceeding in
the Circuit Court and is not necessarily a statement by which
I would be bound if we had. to proceed once again on the
merits in the District County Court.

6

The District County Court denied the motion and Mrs.
DaCoteau then proceeded, by way of habeas corpus in the
District County — in the Circuit Court, alleging the exclusive
ground of lack of jurisdiction in the District Counuy Court to
proceed with the dependency and neglect proceeding and to issue
orders regarding the custody of her two children.
The Circuit Court found that the areas of land that
were open to settlement by the 1891 Act were no longer part of
the reservation, were not longer Indian country, and that
therefore the State District Court had jurisdiction to issue
the custody orders pertaining to these two children, and had
jurisdiction to entertain the dependency and neglect proceeding.
The Supreme Court of South Dakota —
QUESTION:

Mr. Hirsch, isn't the District Court

the court of general jurisdiction in the South Dakota State
court system?
MR. HIRSCH:

The District Court is the court of

jurisdiction in family matters.

The Circuit Court also has

general jurisdiction in other types of cases.
QUESTION:

And .is there appeal from the District

Court to the Circuit Court?
MR. HIRSCH:

I believe that it is possible to appeal

from the District Court to the Circuit Court, but the statutes
also allow, in some instances, for a direct appeal to the
Supreme Court,

7
But we didn't choose to follow that route. We
started a collateral attack on the District Court proceeding,,
by proceeding in Circuit Court with a habeas corpus.

So we

never did finish the trial on the merits of the dependency and
neglect.

That case? in fact, is pending resolution of this

jurisdictional issue.
It was stayed pending resolution of this juris­
dictional issue.,
The Supreme Court of South Dakota, needless to say,
affirmed the Circuit Court and held that the lands that were
open for non-Indian settlement under the 1891 Act were no
longer part of the Reservation.
The place to start, I believe, with this case is
with the Treaty that estab lished the Lake Traverse Reserva­
tion. That Treaty is the Treaty of February 19, 1867.

And in

Article 3 of that Treaty, the Congress ratified an agreement
with the tribe that gave the tribe a very clearly defined
reservation.

And it described the reservation in the Treaty

as a permanent reservation.
The reservation is located in the northeast corner
of South Dakota, with a small portion of it in the southeast
corner of North Dakota.

It's triangular in shape, basically.

Article 10 of the same 1867 Treaty reserved to the
tribal chiefs and head-men the

right to make rules and

regulations for the security and safety of tribal members*

3

the right, basically, to tribal self-government.
There were — from 1867 to 1891 there were no Acts
or any agreement with the tribe that pertained to the
boundaries of this reservation.
And then in 1891, after negotiating an agreement
with the tribe. Congress ratified the agreement that opened
for settlement the surplus lands on the reservation.
Now, the surplus lands are the lands that remain
after allotment and after various other reservations are made,
for example, for schools, religious purposes, for the BIA
agency.

It was

not the BIA agency

in those days, but the

equivalent.
After 1891, it's agresa between the parties, I believe,
that there is no other Act that could have reduced the Lake
Traverse Reservation in size or disestablish the open portions
of it.
So what we're talking about is whether or not the
1891 Act had that effect.
We, of course, maintain that it did not.
And Isd like to start by going into the express
language of the Act.
This Cotart, in Mattz v. Arnett, at 412 U.S., has
held that the test is whether — the test for termination of
a reservation cr for disestablishment of any portion of it,
is whether the language of the Act expressly terminates the

9
reservation o.r whether such termination can be inferred from
a clear legislative history or surrounding circumstances.
The only two sections in the 1891 Act that are at
all pertinent to the issues here are Sections 26 and Section
30,
Now, Section 26 is basically a straight-forward
verbatim transcription or rendition of the agreement that
was reached with the tribe in 1889,

One of the — Article 1

of that agreement, which is repeated in Section 26 of the Act,
says that the tribe cedes, sells, relinquishes and conveys
its title to these surplus lands to the United States,
QUESTION;
MR, HIRSCH:

That’s pretty strong language, isn’t it?
It i.3, Your Honor, but I think that we

have to understand what the rest of that section says, and
read that in context. And I’m going to do that in a second.
And I think we’ll see that the language is much less strong
than it would on the face appear.
Section 30 of the Act, which is the only other Act
affecting the issues here, says that the lands that are ceded
and sold, relinquished and conveyed shall be opened for
settlement under the homestead and townsite laws of th^
United States, except for land sections 16 and 36, which are
reserved for school purposes and made subject to the laws of
the State wherein located.
Now, the important thing, to answer your question,

10
Mr. Justice Blackmun„ about Section 26 and the cession language,
is that in Section 26 the section recites section 5 of the
General Allotment Act.

And it says that this entire agreement

is entered into under the General Allotment Act.

And this

Court, in Mattz v. Arnett, gave a very, very careful analysis
of the General Allotment Act and concluded, at 412 U.'S. page
496, that — and I'm quoting

that the General Allotment

Act permitted the President to make allotments of reservation
lands to resident Indians and, with tribal consent, to sail
surplus lands.

Its policy was to continue the reservation

system, and the trust status of Indian lands, but to allot
tracts to individual Indians for agricultural and grazing —
agriculture and grazing.

When all the lands —-

QUESTION: What are you reading from?

I'm looking

at your Appendix —
MR. HIRSCH:

I'm reading from the Mattz decision,

at page 496.
QUESTION:’
MR. HIRSCH:

Oh, you're reading from a —
From the actual decision of the Court.

I!m not sure whether I have that in —
QUESTION: What, in Mattz?
MR. KIRSCH:

I’m reading the Mattz decision of this

Court.
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:

I see.
A quote from the Mattz decision.

QUESTION:

I thought you wore reading from part of

Section 26.
MR. HIRSCH:

No, I'm not.

The Court said that when ail the lands had been
allotted and the trust expired, the reservation could then
be abolished.
Now, with the Lake Traverse Reservation, the trust
has not expired.

In fact, the — by two Executive Orders

of the President, one in 1914 and one in 1924, the trust
period within the boundaries of the Lake Traverse Reservation
was expressly extended, and it's been extended until right
at this very time.
So the fact that this is a special kind of session,
it’s not comparable to what might be referred to as an
absolute session, where the tribe is very, very clearly
giving up certain lands forever.

This is a session under

the General Allotment Act, and that's a very special kind of
session.
In fact, in Seymour v. Superintendent, which affects
the south half of the Colville Reservation, the language in
the 1906 Colville Act, that this Court interpreted in that
case, said the lands would be sold and disposed.
And this Court found that because it i^as an agree­
ment that was reached under the — or, rather, it wasn’t an
agreement in that case, but the fact that the lands were to

12
be sold and disposed

under the General Allotment Act placed

that in a different category. The same situation existed in
Mattst where Congress had an 1892 Act that disposed of certain
lands within the Hooper Valley or Klamath River Reservation,
under the General Allotment Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hirsch.

MR. HIRSCII:
QUESTION:

Yes?
Does the record indicate the number of

square miles that are involved in this claimed reservation?
MR. HIRSCH:

The record of the case itself, I

don't believe does, unless Exhibit No. 1 might refer to it.
Exhibit No. 1 is a 1936 map of the

— an official map of the

Department of the Interior, that shows •— and it's the map
a

%

that's in use today by the Department of the Interior —
it shows the reservation, and with an identical description
to the reservation that was established in 1867»
Now, I don't know whether the legend of that map
contains an acreage total.
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCII:

Is it this —* the same as this or not?
No, it's not.

QUESTION: This was given to us in a different case,
but it is the United States Department of Interior, Bureau
of Indian Affairs, Indian Land Areas, General.
MR. HIRSCH:.

Right.

That map is a map of the United States.

13
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HIRSCH:

And imprinted on the map are the Indian

land areas.
QUESTION:

And that's the map that the BIA uses today.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION: Does the record indicate the number of
Indians living in the area now, or the number of non-Indians
living in the area now?
MR. HIRSCH:

No, it doesn't.

I know the information, if you vrant it.
QUESTION: Well, fine.
MR. HIRSCH:

Yes.

Would you give it?

The reservation contains 918,000

acres, approximately; it's 918,300.
QUESTION:
MR. IIIRSCII:

You mean as originally --- as originally?
That’s right.

That's right.

And the —
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:

What's that? Roughly 150 square miles.
I — it's 120 miles from north to

south, and it's ~~ at the widest point from east to west it's
about 40 miles, I believe.

The Indian population on the reservation today is
approximately 3300 tribal members living on or adjacent to
the reservation.
QUESTION:

What's the total population?

MR.. HIRSCH:

Of the reservation area, Indian and non-’

Indian?
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It's approximately 30,000.
That would be —
Or a little less.
— would be 27,000 difference,if you

prevail hers, be subject to tribal jurisdiction?
MR. HIRSCH:

No.

Not it all.

This case only raises

the issue of’ the tribe's right to have jurisdiction over its
own membership.
QUESTION:

Only enrolled membership?

MR. HIRSCH:

Only — that's correct.

QUESTION:

Well, now, that must be — that must

follow from the 1891 Act, something happened in the 1891 Act,
then, to the reservation?
MR. HIRSCH:

That's xrLght.

QUESTION: Because if this were a reservation — if
the reservation hadn't been disturbed in any way, the tribe’s
authority would extend to everybody on the reservation.
MR. HIRSCH:

The tribes authority would extend to

15
all tlie- Indians.
QUESTION:

And everybody else.

MR. HIRSCH:

If the reservation had not been

disturbed in any way.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HIRSCH:
QUESTION:

Well, —
Well, wouldn’t it?

MR. HIRSCH:

The issue of whether or not the tribe

has jurisdiction over non-Indians on — on —■
QUESTION:

On reservations.

MR. HIRSCH:

— what's generally an Indian

country, is an issue that is presently being litigated in
several courts and is not really clear.

It's clear that the

tribe has certain jurisdiction over non-Indians under
certain circumstances.
QUESTION:

Well, I'll put it to you a different

way.
After the 1891 Act, the tribe's authority over
ceded — over the land that was ceded, was different than it
was before? wasn't it?
MR. HIRSCH:

What we are maintaining here is that —

QUESTION:

I know what you're maintaining.

MR. HIRSCH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
I know you're maintaining you've got

authority over Indians

16

Did the 1891 Act change the tribe's authority in
any way over the land and those living on it within the area
of the reservation as you claim it to be?
MR. HIRSCH:

I don't believe it did.

I don't

believe it did.
The tribe's authority was given to it by the 1867
Treaty, and I don't think that the 1891 Act in any way changed
the 1867 Treaty.
QUESTION: Well, then, under Williams v. Lee,
certainly the Indian authorities would have a great deal of
authority over non-Indians within the reservation area,
wouldn't they?
MR. HIRSCH:

Williams v. Lee was a case, as I recall,,

where a non-Indian xvas suing an Indian for recovery of money
that was owed for purchases at a store on the Navajo Reserva­
tion ,
QUESTION: And they said he couldn't sue in the State
courts?
MR, HIRSCH:

They said he couldn’t sue in the State

court, because there was an Indian defendant in the case.
QUESTION:

Well, would this be true here, too, that

from now on the non-Indian couldn't sue in the South Dakota
District Court, if he lived within this reservation area?
MR. HIRSCH:

If non-Indians live within the

reservation, and they have a civil action of the nature,

as

17
was dealt with by this Court in Williams v. Lee, yes.
And they would have to sue in the tribal court,
and there is a tribal court that has been exercising that
jurisdiction since August of 1972.
QUESTION:

And this reservation covers parts of five

different counties in South Dakota, doesn’t it?
MR. ITIRSCH:

That’s correct.

And it also has a

little strip in North Dakota.
The Section 26 of the 1891 Act says that the
reservation or —
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:
QUESTION:

Well, just to make sure that —
Yes.
You concede or you, whether you call it

a concession or not, but you think the fact is that here the
tribe on this land would have, no authority over non-Indians?
MR. HIRSCH:

No, I’m not saying that at all.

I’m

saying that —
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:

On this, on the ceded land.
That on the ceded lands it’s

definitely clear, in terms of our position here today, it’s
definitely clear that the tribe has complete civil jurisdic­
tion over non-Indians when an Indian is a defendant in a civil
action, and perhaps even when a non-Indian is a defendant in
a civil action.
QUESTION:

So your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun's

18
question a while ago was that, yes, this case does involve all
those people, all those non-Indians living on the reservation.
MR. HIRSCH:

But not necessarily to the all-inclusive

extent of what Mr. Justice Blackmun was perhaps getting to;
and that is, that where the action is between two non-Indians,
then the tribe’s jurisdiction —
QUESTION;

What's the authority of the State over a

non-Indian living on ceded land?
What if it's a — what about the State's criminal
laii/s?

For example.
MR. HIRSCH;

The State's —

QUESTION;

Or its civil law or its child neglect

MR. HIRSCH;

Right.

law.

QUESTION:

Right.

With respect to a non-Indian in this

ceded country?
QUESTION:

Just take this case, if these had been

non-Indians, in other words.
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:

Exactly.
If he's a non-Indian, the State law

applies to him, on the reservation.
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH;

Why, if this is a reservation?
The only way in which the tribe holds

the reservation is to have jurisdiction over its own membership
on the reserv ation and to have jurisdiction over non-Indians

19

where the actione of non—Indians affect essential tribal
relations.

That that's what the courts —
QUESTION:

But they don't, in the cited cases,

do they —
MR. HIRSCH:

— that's what the Court said in

Williams v. Lee.
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:

Beg pardon?
I say that's what this Court said in

Wi Hi ants v. Lee.
QUESTION:

Well, Williams v. Lee said the — if

I have the case in mind properly — said that the State courts
did not have jurisdiction.

And that was a case where a non-

Indian plaintiff was suing an Indian defendant, as I
remember it.

Right?

MR. HIRSCH:

A non-Indian plaintiff suing an Indian

defendant; that's correct.
.

courts did not have

jurisdiction.
MR. HIRSCH:

That's right.

They had to go to tribal

court.
QUESTION: ;
MR. HIRSCH:

Cut there's a —
And I maintain the same situation would

exist here, if that situation occurred

on this reservation,

on the ceded lands.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the question is, as put by my

20

brother White, what if, in this very case, these people had
been non-Indias, that this mother had been a non-Indian and
her. children had been non-Indians and the acts had occurred
just as they did occur?
If this is a reservation, that would have given the
tribal council and its courts jurisdiction, an exclusive
jurisdiction, would it not?
QUESTION:

This isn’t a — isn't a 230 law State

either, is it?
MR. HIRSCH:

No, it's not.

No, it's not.

Now, the thing is that for the tribe to acquire
jurisdiction over non-Indians, there would have to be an Act
of Congress that conferred that jurisdiction on the tribe.
QUESTION:

But they have it if it's an Indian

reservation, don't they?
MR. HIRSCH:

The Treaty that established this

reservation specifically says, in Article 10, that the chiefs
and head-men of the tribe can make rules and regulations for
the government of its own membership, within the boundaries
of the reservation.
Nov;, how far that extends is an issue that is,
perhaps, an open issue.
QUESTION:
v. Lee?

Was that any different than in Williams

I mean, was there a specific Act of Congress in

Williams v. Lee that gave the Navajos the authority to regulate

21

non-Indians on the reservation?
MR. HIRSCH:

No.

The situation there is that there

was an Indian defendant, and the law as it's corns down,
federal Indian law, does not give a tribe jurisdiction in a
case inhere both parties are non-Indians.

But where one of

the parties is an Indian, then you have a different .situation.
And that's the essence of the holdings of this Court.
QUESTION: Well, what case particularly said that?
MR, HTRSCH:
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:

Well, you have —
Or any case.
Okay.

Well, in Williams vs. Lee,

that’s one case that says that.
QUESTION:

Which held that the State did not have

jurisdiction?
MR. HIRSCH:

That the State does not have juris­

diction.
QUESTION:
MR. HIRSCH:
QUESTION:

Now, are there any —
Because there was an Indian defendant.
Yes.

Now, I'm interested in any case

or cases that you know of that say that the State does have
jurisdiction over people living on an Indian reservation.
MR. HIRSCH:

The cases of Draper and McBrafcnev,

they were criminal cases where non-Indians were involved.
And the area of criminal jurisdiction is defined by 18 U.S.C.
1151, and that's the case that you have next in Feather, where

22
the Major Crimes Act applies to —
QUESTION:
MR. IIIRSCH!
QUESTION:

Well, that's federal jurisdiction.
That's right.
I'm talking about State.

Well, just any

case or cases that say that the State may exert its power of
its law, criminal or civil, over people living on an Indian
reservation.
MR. HIRSCH:

For a State to get jurisdiction, be it

civil or criminal, over Indians on an Indian reservation, —
QUESTION:

No, no.

No.

I think -- I don't want

to be repetitious, but perhaps — let me just say it once
more:

over people living on an Indian reservation, non-

Indians, let's assume they are.

And this is not a Public

Lav/ 280 State.
MR. HIRSCH:

I think that the answer is that a

State has jurisdiction over all the people within the State,
except as Congress otherwise states.

And with regard to

Indians, Congress has otherwise stated.
This particular case only, though, involves the
issue of the tribe's right to control its own people, to make
rttles and regulations for its own people.
QUESTION:

But I think the questions from the

bench indicate that the significance of this case may go much
further.
them.

That's the point of the questions, as I understood

23

MR. HIRSCH:

Well, to be honest, I'm not exactly —

this is a very developing area of lav/, and I'm not exactly
sure in what direction it's going to go in the next few years.
There's a case pending in the Ninth Circuit now that raises
these issues, and maybe it will reach this Court? I don't know.
This area of law has really not been litigated,
and it's first coming to the fore how.
But with regard to this 1891 Act, I think that it's
definitely clear that it did not reduce the size of this
reservation, so as to take away from the tribe its jurisdic­
tion over its own people.
Congress has passed three Acts in recent years that
continue to recognize the boundaries of this reservation.
In 1972 there was a Claims Distribution Award Act, and that
Act, in the legislative history specifically refers to the
Sissaton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation,
and the Act gave one million dollars in a lump sum to the tribe
and the rest was distributed per capita.
In 1974 there were two Acts that were passed, one
of which restored to tribal ownership ninety, approximately
ninety acres of land that had been in federal ownership.
This Court, in Matts, thought that it was significant
that a 1958 Act had restored from federal ownership to tribal
ownership certain lands within the Klamath River Reservation.
In 1974 also there was an Act that allowed the tribe

24

to consolidate its land-holdings within the reservation.
And if you look at the — if you look at the map of the
reservation that the Solicitor General attached to his brief,
you can see that the tribal land-holdings are scattered all
across the reservation.
And if, in fact, the tribe has been given authority
by Congress, which it has been this year, to consolidate its
land-holdings, if it wanted to consolidate the land-holdings
in the southern tip of the reservation with those to the north,
it would have to buy up a considerable portion of land.
I think it's clear from the legislative history of
these Acts, which refer to the reservation as a V-shaped
reservation located in the northeastern corner of South
Dakota and the southeastern corner of North Dakota, it’s
clear that Congress in 1974, in passing these laws, thought
that the reservation continued to ex ist in

the way it was

established in 1867.
More than that, in 1892, and consistently from that
time on, every annual report of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior have recognised
the reservation as undiminished.
The Proclamation of the President opening the
reservation did the same, talked about lands embraced within
the reservation.

And the Secretary of the Interior, in 1895,

in an opinion, said that — he referred to ceded lands lying

25

within the reservation boundaries.

That's the decision of

Edward Parant.
I see that my time is up.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Hirsch.

Mr. Day.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. DAY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Your Honors, if this land in question, the boundaries
thereof, the perimeters, are an Indian reservation, the State
of South Dakota doesn't have any jurisdiction.

If this land,

except for the allotments thereon, has been ceded, then the
State of South Dakota does have jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

If it has been ceded, Mr. Day, wouldn't

you have an extraordinarily difficult problem of administering
the laws> civil or criminal, if it would be on a patchwork
basis of everything that's white there being under the
jurisdiction~of South Dakota, and everything that's red being
under the jurisdiction of the tribe?
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Tell me why not.
Not that difficult, no, sir.
I'd be interested in knowing, sometime

during the course of your argument, why not.

26

MR. DAY:
QUESTIONi

To illustrate —
The United States makes quite a point

of that.
MR. DAY:

Yes, they do, sir.

And I will go into it.

I can go into it now, if you would like.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

At your convenience.
I’d like to show the Court the position

of the State of South Dakota on this map that is part of the
government’s amicus brief, in the back of it.

And we can

kind of — we had the Colville case this morning.

And the

north half of the Colville Reservation was ceded, or it was
restored to the public domain.
Now, in 1887, they started the General Allotment
Act, and Senator Dawes started that, and that let the
Secretary of the Interior, whenever he thought it for the
best interest of the Indians, and there was surplus land, to
allot these Indians or not allot them, as he saw fit, and
sell off whatever portion of their surplus reservation that
they wanted to.
So if the north half, for example, of the Colville
Reservation was ceded, that would leave, and did leave, the
south half.

The north half boundaries would be no more,

because when they ceded it, they would necessarily, by metes
and bounds or something, strike a line across where it was
ceded, and the north half was no more.

Now, this is, in effect, what happened in the
Sisseton-Wahpeton Reservation.

The Secretary of Interior

appointed a commission to go out and treat with these Indians
for the sale of their land, and they did.

And under the

agreement in the wording of the 1809 and 1891 Act, they ceded,
sold, relinquished and conveyed all interest in all of their
lands that had been —■ except the ones that had been allotted,
or were going to be allotted.
So, in effect, what that did, if we can show this
Court that the cede is strong enough and the words are strong
enough, the legislative history, that wiped out the boundaries
of this reservation and left the allotments sitting there on
the public domain.
Now, this gets into -- to further our position of the
State — as to what is Indian country.
defined, by statute, Indian country.

And in 1948 they
1151(a) and, for our

purposes, 1151(c).
Now, 1151(a) defined Indian country is all land
within an Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the
United States, except — notwithstanding patents and including
rights-of-way.
Now, that would be under the south half of the
Colville Reservation; 1151(a).

That had not been opened, or

it had not been ceded, and that would be the south half of
the Colville.

28

Now, 1151(c), Indian country is defined as all
Indian allotments, the Indian title to which has not been
extinguished,
And this is the north half of the Colville -QUESTION:
MR. DAY;
QUESTION:
MR. DAY;
QUESTION;

You're confusing me —
Okay, sir.
The Colville case we argued this morning
Yes, sir.

I'm giving that as —

This map is of something else in a

different State.
MR. DAY:

Yes.

This is the Sisseton-Wahpeton map.

I'm giving that as an example, the same thing had happened
here; only in 1892 they had — there's some argument made here
about, you've got to have a boundary.

And I'm saying in the

Colville they had a boundary, because they only took away
half of it.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

And here we don't have that situation.
No, sir.

QUESTION; All right.
MR. DAY:

Here they took away all of it.

Which

left this under 1151(c) —QUESTION %
red there is Indian
MR. DAY;

Under 1151(c), everything colored in
country, as so defined.
Yes, sir.

And consequently, the State of South Dakota is not

29

after any Indian reservation, because we don't ~~ we have
Indian reservations in South Dakota, in the Rosebud and the
Pine Ridge? but this ceased to be an Indian reservation, and
I think under that theory.
Nov?, this leaves us, Your Honor, with some checker­
board jurisdiction, and 1151(c) was actually statuturited
under the United States vs. Pelican case.

And in Pelican —■

in the Pelican case, they recognised that there was going to
be some checkerboard jurisdiction.
If I may quote a moment, on page 399 of the Pelican
decision —
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

What\s the cite?
232 U.S. 442, sir.

And on page 399 there is a statement:

It is said

that it is not to be supposed that Congress has intended to
maintain the federal jurisdiction over hundreds of allotments
scattered through territory, other portions of which were
open to white settlement.

But Congress expressly so provided

with respect to offenses committed in violation of the Act of
1897.

Nor does the territorial jurisdiction of the United

States depend upon the sise of the particular areas which are
held for federal purposes.
And they contemplate that until — and these Indian
allotments, which are trust allotments, that's what they're
called, trust patents.

It's been historically that they go

30

away. Some of them are sold.

There would be a lot less

allotments here, in my guess, now than there would have been
back in 1891, for example, because they are issued fees on
them upon proper application, and they're sold.
QUESTION:

From what you say, I take it there could

be a 90-acre tract that would be subject to federal juris­
diction and all the surrounding, immediately surrounding,
contiguous areas would be State jurisdiction.
MR. DAY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And there are soma of them, ninety acres;
are there not?
MR. DAY:
QUESTION;

I can't tell for sure how long the —
Well, there are some very small ones,

anyway.
MR. DAY:

There surely could be some.

And if you

look here, there's tracts of land together, and I don't know
that if this map constitutes a section as one mile, because
when I counted the squares on it the other day I didn't
come up to 120 miles, I only come up to about 75; so I don't
know for sure if that's — if each one of the squares
represents a mile or not.
But that is true under 1151(c), Your Honor, is
exactly what you stated and —
QUESTION:

This tribal jurisdiction on the

checkerboard design would be as to allotted lands only, is

31
that your position?
MR. DAY:

Tribal jurisdiction would foe to Indian

allotments only.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:

Only.
Tribal and/or federal,
Is that without regard to whether those

living on the allotted lands were Indians or non-Indians?
Non-Indians can live on allotted lands, can't they?
MR. DAY:

Yes, they could.

QUESTION: And would jurisdiction in that instance
be with the tribal court?
MR. DAY:

It's my understanding, Your Honor, that

recently the tribal council passed an ordinance assuming civil
and criminal jurisdictions over non-Indian persons.
QUESTION:

On their Indian lands?

MR. DAY:

Yes.

Well, in this whole reservation, because of the
Feather case.

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, in the

next case we’re having, said that this — they reversed
themselves and said, Now, we didn't cede this back in 1891,
so they have jurisdiction —
QUESTION:
you think

Yes, I know, I understand that. But do

— did the Eighth Circuit decide that the tribe

had — under its decision would have authority over non-Indians?
MR. DAY:

The Eighth Circuit didn't decide that.

QUESTION:

No, but the tribe, you say, has now

exerted authority within the entire area over non-Indians?
MR. DAY:

They have passed as ordinance, I believe,

yes.
QUESTION:

Well now, how about South -- what’s

South Dakota’s position?

Is it your position that you would

have authority over anybody who is living on allotted — on
ceded land?

Indians or non-Indians?

MR. DAY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: What is your position with respect to nonIndians living on allotted lands?
MR. DAY:

The State of Smith Dakota doss not have

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

Criminal or civil?
No, sir.
And you don't claim it?
No, sir.

Another interesting —■
QUESTION:

Do you have a breakdovm of these

30,000 non-Indians living on allotted lands?

Does the record

tell us anything about that?
MR. DAY:

Well, I don't believe so, sir.

There

wouldn't be very many —- I live out near the Rosebud
Reservation, and it's got to be about the same. There wouldn't
be very many non-Indians living on allotted lands, but they

33
would at least —
QUESTION: Well, let’s assume that — let’s assume
that a non-Indian kills another non-Indian on allotted land.
MR. DAY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

You’re suggesting that South Dakota has

never attempted to apply its criminal law to such situation?
MR. DAY:

You say a non-Indian on a non-Indian on

allotted land?
I believe that the State of South Dakota would have,
jurisdiction.
QUESTION: Well, that's what I thought.

Then you

just said a mimrfce ago that you weren’t claiming jurisdiction
MR., DAY:

Over Indians on allotted land.

QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

Oh, sure, we could claim —

QUESTION:
allotted lands.

Well, I’m saying non-Indians.

My question was:

non-Indians living on

You have a good many non-Indians living on

allotted lands, don’t you, on this reservation?
MR. DAY:

Wall, I wouldn't say too many.

I’d say

QUESTION:

Well, you have some.

MR. DAY:

We would have jurisdiction, in my

opinion, over the non-Indians.
QUESTION:

In other words, no matter what, whether

civil or criminal —
MR. DAY:

Yes.

3 '3

QUESTION?

— even though they live on these

allotted lands, if they're non-Indian, tribal courts have no
jurisdiction.
MR. DAY:

Well, they will have what jurisdiction

they attempt to take, Your Honor, under the — under their
ordinance.
I'm saying the State has jurisdiction, but now
they've passed an ordinance saying that they also have juris
diction over all people within —
QUESTION; Well, .‘Let's just forget the Eighth
Circuit decision, just for a moment.
MR. DAY;
QUESTION;

Okay.
South Dakota’s position historically

has been that it doss have criminal jurisdiction, at least,
over non-Indians wherever they are living.
MR. DAY;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
In — within or without Indian

reservations.
MR. DAY;
QUESTION:;

Yes, sir,
Now, you may run — with respect to

civil jurisdiction, you may have a little — if it’s a
business transaction with Indians, you may have a problem
with that.
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Does South Dakota's position depend,

35
to a certain extent, on whether or not this is in fact an
Indian reservation?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. DAY;

Well, yes.

It does.

It depends on it to

the extent of all this original 1867 area.

Otherwise, if

we’re correct, there is no area except Indian country on these
red, red dots, i»7hich are trust patents or trust allotments,
in Indian land.
QUESTION;

Now, would there be any non-Indians

living on those trust allotments; and, if so, how, or why
would they?
MR. DAY;

There could be through lease.

Most of

the land down in the Rosebud area is leased by ranchers and
there could be some improvements there.
but it could be.

It would be unusual,

It could happen.

QUESTION:

Yes.

They are —- excuse me.

QUESTION;

A lot of non-Indians ^working on the —

on allotted lands that’s leased; there might be people ridingon them.
MR. DAY:

Oh, yes.

QUESTION:

Yes.

Cattle on them?

MR. DAY; Right. Right.
Are there any ocher questions around, like that?
[Laughter. j
QUESTION:

A great many of them.

MR. DAY;

Excuse me, sir?

QUESTION:

A great many of them.

MR. DAY:

Okay.

QUESTION:

Let me be very sure, because I share

this confusion.
If Mr. Justice kite's horseman is riding across
allotted land, and he's a non-Indian and he is shot by a nonIndian, the State of South Dakota assumes criminal jurisdic­
tion over that case?
MR. DAY:

That would be my opinion, yes.

QUESTION s' But if he is shot by an Indian?
MR. DAY:

It would be federal — it could be one

of the ten major crimes, which would be exclusively in the
federal court then.
QUESTION:

Now, does your answer to Mr. Justice

Blackmun's question there depend in any respect on whether
or not this is an Indian reservation, or whether it was
all ceded?
MR. DAY:

On — on white-on-white, it's not going

to make any difference.

But where —- sir, where you have

problems or where you could have, since 1891, the State of
South 'Dakota has assumed jurisdiction over all of this area,
except on the allotments, over Indians and whites.
Now you have a situation, if Feather holds up,
where if you have an Indian and a white in a fight, for

example, so the State court, is going to have to go out and
arrest the white man, the tribal court is going to have to go
out and arrest the Indian. And it’s —
QUESTION:

But you suggested that the tribe now has

an ordinance that would govern b oth sides of the transaction,
MR. DAY;

It could.

And then you would be forcing —

QUESTION:

Or could it — you say it has an

ordinance like that.
MR. DAY:

I don’t think they could exercise that —•

they’ve done it, but I don’t know what they've done, how
far they've gone.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

They've been waiting on some litigation.
Yes, probably.
Such as this, I suppose.
But then, Your Honor, you're putting —

you're into another altogether different situation, where the
State has been handling this and assuming it since 1891, up
until the Feather decision in 1970, in 1972, I think that's the
first time after that that the tribe has had a force up there.
But I'll get on with the balance of it.
We're saying, Your Honor, that cede, sell, relinquish
and convey all right, title and interest, is strong enough,
a3 in the case of Ellis v. Page, it’s strong enough to grant
cession just like the words "public domain" were used,
In the brief there are — we've looked this up in the

30
Webster’s Dictionary, and the word "cede" — and in other
dictionaries

and the word "cede" is what generally is

used when one country grants cession to another country.
They’ve made some statements, well, maybe you
should have "cede absolutely", maybe that’s all right? or
maybe you should have "cede absolutely and forever" like in
Blli3 v. Page, but I think once you cede, convey, relinquish
all right, title and interest —
QUESTION:

You don't agree with Mr, Hirsch that

it’s a special kind cf cession here?
MR. DAY:

No, sir.

This was a direct cession,

wherein the State of South Dakota — or when the federal
government bought this land from this tribe for $2.50 an acre
plus some other considerations, they bought it outright.
In turn, they went back and sold it to the settlers for the
same price.

But it was not the same money, and it’s not

like the Mattz case, it's not like the Newtown case, or
Seymour, which wasn't — which was a trustee homestead
type relationship.

And this case is a cession agreement

and it's different than that.
In those cases the government didn't guarantee to
sell the land, the tribe didn't get paid until their land was
sold and settled by the homesteaders ? this was a direct
cession.

Even though in the — which I'll get to in the other

case — even though the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals said

39

it wasn’t? but it absolutely is.
This bill, in the 1891 Act, when it was passed there
were about seven other reservations, and this was tacked on to
the Indian General Allotment Act.
Senator Dawes, who wrote the 1887 Dawes Act, or
General Allotment Act, also was the main Senator on this bill.
Senator Dawes, prior to the time the bill passed, made the
statement that all this seven or eight million of acres of
land going in there that day was going to be restored to the
public domain.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in 1890, prior
to the passage of this bill, said this land is going to be
restored to the public domain and specifically mentions
Sisseton-VJahpeton, 660,000 acres, roughly —* and I imagine
the reason he mentioned it was because it was sold for $2.50
an acre, and the rest was $1.50 an acre.
The Department of Interior reports also confirm this.
From that time on, from 1892, the official maps of
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, forssveral years, wiped it
off.

Everything then was referred to as “former”, "former

Sissieton-Wahpeton".
Then we get going down the road for several years,
and then the maps change.

They might get a circle around it,

and say it’s "former reservation" or might be later on
shaded in.

And I think a map that you have up here today

40
— that X thought I saw — shows the Indian reservation today
as the "original Sisseton-Wahpeton Indian Reservation", as it
was back in 1867.
And I'm suggesting, Your Honors, that in order to
determine congressional intent, or legislative history, all
that is needed to ba done in this case is to go back to the
Act, prior to the Act, after the Act, look at what Senator
Dawes says, who was primarily responsible for the Act —
QUESTION: Do you know what State the Senator was
from?
MR. DAY:

He was from Massachusetts, I believe, sir.

QUESTION:

Was he related to the later Vice President?

MR. DAY:

I don’t know.

QUESTION:

Who was also very concerned in Indian

MR. DAY:

I surely don't know.

affairs?

We think, Your Honors, that the cession language,
that you don't have to go any further than the face of the Act.
South Dakota came into being as a State in 1889.
In the enabling Act, Congress stated that South Dakota, when
it came and was to ba a State, received Section 16 and 36
as school cessions.

But it specifically said that if any

of these sections or any of this land was in an Indian
reservation, that the grant did not take effect until the
reservation had been extinguished and the proper — and the

41
reservation restored to the public domain.
That's in Section 10 of the enabling Act, which
brought us into Statehood.
I'm suggesting that this is further intention to show
that this, the intent of everyone at that time was to cede
the reservation, except these allotments,

extinguish the

boundaries, and you'd have left what in 1948 is determined as
Indian country, under 1151(c).
There was another another school land cession in
the Act, and that might not be — that's open to interpreta­
tion ; they've argued about it.
In the brief, this provision was taken to the
English Department at the University of South Dakota and
they gave an opinion that the phrase modified not just the
school land sections 16 and 36, but modified all of the land
being open to the — or subject to the laws of the State of
South Dakota.
I'm suggesting, Your Honors, that if the Act is
read, and the legislative history surrounding this Act is
determined, that it's clear under the rules set forth in
Mattz that this reservation in 1891 was terminated.
QUESTION:

What is South. Dakota's interest in

exercising jurisdiction over Indians in ceded territory?
MR. DAY:

Indians are citizens of the State of

South Dakota, Your Honor, and we always have exercised juris-

42

diction over Indians and non-Indians alike in this area, for
almost eighty years.
And now, when it appears thatthey're going to be
under -two or three different laws, it's really causing a
lot of commotion.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that, the State's

jurisdiction over non-Indians was not disturbed at all, and
the only question is the jurisdiction over 3,000 Indians»
within this area.
You're not going to be disturbed very much, are
you?
If that were the result — I understand that it
may be that that wouldn't be the result, that the tribe or
someone may claim that the Indian, the tribal authority is
exclusive within the whole area, with respect to Indians and
non-Indians alike.

That may be what somebody will claim.

But let's just assume, for the moment, that the
only impact of a holding that the reservation was not dis­
established is that you wouldn't have jurisdiction over 3,000
Indians.
MR. DAY:

The impact, Your Honor, might not be as

great, when you have one class of people you wouldn't have to
worry about.
