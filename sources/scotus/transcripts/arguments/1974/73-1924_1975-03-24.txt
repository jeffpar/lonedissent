MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1924, Muniz against Hoffman.
You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Van
Bourg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR J. VAN BOURG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. VAN BOURG;
please the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The question in this case, of course, is

the question of jury t*ial in criminal contempt matters, and
we have two distinct arguments, one being the constitutional
argument, and one being the statutory argument.
I think the constitutional question has to be
discussed first, and we will undertake to do that, because
it rests upon the vague line of what is a serious offense and
what is a petty offense, and the only statutory assistance we
have is title 18, section 1(3), namely, the $500 provision
and the 6-months imprisonment provision.
The adjudication in criminal contempt in this case
leaves a great deal to be desired with respect to clarity on
that point.

We have a fine of $25,000, $15,000 of which is

suspended, much as would be the case in civil contempt, i.e,,
behave yourself for a year and that $15,000 will not be
reinstated, but if you misbehave, the full $15,000 will be
reinstated.

And the degree of misbehavior is not discussed.

4
There is no de-termination as to whether it would he the same
kind of a proceeding as if we would have a motion to revoke
probation.
Cn the imprisonment side, the individual, Munis, is
told that he is on probation for a year and it was pointed out
to him that the court 'retains jurisdiction to impose the
6-month prison sentence or jail sentence.

Again, we have some

vagueness in the judge's orders.
But the critical question is whether or not this is
a serious or petty offense.

And I think that there is no

question this was not a multicount issue insofar as the
adjudication was concerned, it was treated as a single count.
It is a $25,000 or $10,000 fine depending upon how you want to
view it, and there is a criminal record imposed upon an
individual human being who has the potential of going to
prison or jail.
Now, why do we even deal with that issue when wa seem
to have a much more clear-cut presentation on the statutory
side?

I think it's very important for us to deal with that

issue because we find ourselves confronted with contempts and
injunctions throughout various phases of the law, and I think
it's critical that we deal with the constitutional question on
the jury side.
QUESTION:

The individual, however, is not in a

position to make the constitutional claim.

5
MR. VAN BOURG:

Because of the nature of the

adjudication, we do not appeal on the criminal side for James
Muniz.

We appeal only with respect to the union on the

constitutional sida.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. VAN BOURG:
QUESTION:

Now, the issue here —

He can make the statutory argument.

MR. VAN BOURG:

Yes, he makes the statutory argument.

The union makes the constitutional argument and the statutory
argument•, Munis, the individual, makes the statutory argument.
But the understanding, the fulcrum question, the understanding
of how an institution such as a labor organization operates,
is what'3 fundamental to the whole trial of the case. The
union itself did nothing.

The union was held in contempt and

adjudicated in criminal contempt, and the order to show cause
against it as an alleged contemnor wa3 based upon the conduct
of the individual Muniz.
Now, a labor organization does not authorize its
officers, the president
action.

in this case, to engage in criminal

So all of the knowledge, all of the conduct, all of

the assumed knowledge, all of the imputed conduct done by the
individual is attributed to the organization without anything
further being done or said or presented.

So the $25,000

exposure to the union is part and parcel and cannot be
connected with the adjudication with respect to the probation

6
and the potential of six-months jail for Muniz, the theory
being, as discussed in the cases and as discussed in all of the
briefs, that the union can't go to jail but its president can.
So this contempt,
most cases.

the adjudication, .is the same as it is in

The union is fined, that is, will hurt their

treasury, the members who made no consent whatsoever, no proof
that, they even knew about the conduct, their pocket-books are
going to-foe hurt.

But the president, we are going to put him

Mow, that's — even though Muniz only can argue the
stffjthtp'ry question, the fundamentals of the case, the notion
c>| contempt in,general witli respect to labor organisations and
their officers and their exposure is fundamentally connected.
Now, i think that it would belabor the point for us
to recite, the provisions of the Constitution and to review
again and again the provisions of tile section 1(3) of title 18
with respect to the $500 fine and the 6-month jail sentence.
QUESTION:

Is the argument you make, tills agency

argument, any different from vrhat it would foe with a corporation
and its chief executive officer?
MR, VAN BOURG;
for this reason:

It is different in many respects,

A labor organization does have a different

life, does have a different foundation, and is governed by
different statutory considerations than a corporation,

the

critical one being that they have constitutions governing much

7
more precisely what can be, what cannot be done by officers,
and the congr sessional enactment specifying the types of things
that union officers and unions in general can and can’t do.
Of course, corporations are governed by different statutory
prescriptions and proscriptions, and they, too, have by-laws
and they, too, have articles of incorporation.

So in a general

legal sense, of course, a corporation and a union can be
equated as to the type of legal person they are.
respect to how labor unions are organised

Rut with

and how they are

regulated by statutory enactments and indeed as to how they
are treated by the courts, the practical aspects are that they
are different from corporations, particularly in this kind of
a situation.
QUESTION:

Stockholders can, even though it may be

very difficult, they can fire presidents of corporations.
MR. VAN BOURG:

Yes, they can.

The union membership,

however, unless it has an impeachment procedure as is required
under the Landrum-Griffin provisions of 1959, cannot fire the
president of the union.

He is elected for a specified term

and he cannot be fired.

Now, impeachment provisions exist,

impeachment proceedings may be brought.

They are rare.

And

it would require in this case a local union of 7,000 to 9,000
members for the unions to have knowledge of what is happening
as a basis for the proceedings and to bring the impeachment
proceedings <,

3

QUESTION;

How long wag the president's term of

office?
MR. VAN BOURG:

At the time that this conduct was

engaged in, it was his first term, and it was not a full term,
ixi other words, he took over in the middle of a term.
QUESTION:

How long did he have to serve for the

remainder of the term?
MR. VAN BOURG:

As I recall it, it was one-half or

two-thirds of a three-year term.

Now, my recollection is not

clear on that point, but it is true, and so that the Court is
aware of the fact, he was re-elected for another term subsequently,
I don't want that issue to cloud any of the questions that have
to be determined here, but I do think that in dealing with the
question of contempt, as to an organization, the Solicitor makes
mhch of the fact that because this is a corporation that right
to jury trial, in his words, "shall not be extended to a labor
organization."
I don't think the question of the Constitution of the
United States deals with extension of constitutional rights.
The constitutional rights are there, and the thing is a little
bit twisted around.

It is the Solicitor who argues that that

right should be taken away from the union.

Now, it's true that

the courts have dealt differently with respect to corporate or
associate persons as opposed to humans in terms of how they
have dealt with the question of jury trial.

And Chef f is a

9

good example, of course, of that issue.

Nonetheless, the

constitutional issue, I think, is clear.
drawn.

The. line has to be

Lawyers who try these cases both as to corporate

persons and as to individuals have to know the line between the
petty offense and the serious offense.

We always take the

position of the $500 and the 6 months.

And indeed in this case

the judge in reserving jurisdiction on the adjudication of
criminal contempt used the 6-months rule or measure as the
basis for the jail term or the potential jail terra with
respect to petitioner Muniz.

He did not, however, use the

$500 rule in imposing the fine.
I will not say more at this time with respect to the
constitutional question, again because I think it would belabor
the point to go over that again.
all of tire briefs before it.

The Court obviously has

I do, however, want to discuss

the statutory question with some emphasis.
We have the clear language of 3692.

We have an

absolute contradiction of the Ninth Circuit and our decision
in the case that was rendered in the First Circuit in Union
Naoional.

I think that that issue thus is squarely before the

Court.
New, the thrust of the Solicitor's argument that a
jury trial is not necessary in this kind of a contempt would
require, and of course we agree and urge the conclusion of
the decision in Nacional, would require that the plain meaning

10

cf the statute be. negated and that the Court not pay attention
to the phrase "any case involving a labor dispute.”

There is

no question but the fact situation ixi our case involves a
labor dispute, none whatsoever.

There is no question that it is

the kind of a labor dispute which is either protected or
prohibited or governed or regulated by Taft-Hartley as veil as
perhaps by other statutes.

There ie no question that the cause

of action arises because of statutes of the United States.
There is no question that the petition was sought by the
Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board
pursuant to the. provisions of section 10(1) of Taf t-Hartley.
Nacional deals with 10 (j), but the authority of the Regional
Director to petition for injunctive relief was specifically
the same under 10(j) as it is under 10(d).
Wow, it is urged upon the Court that Congress did not
intend a jury trial in a contempt proceeding to prevail because
that would interfere with the orderly processing of the scheme
of: regulation of the Labor Management Relations Act, and we
submit that that is incorrect and should riot be accepted by the
Court.

The basis for that submission is the fact that civil

contempt has to do with compliance with the order.
even conceded by the Ninth Circuit in our case.

That was

Criminal

contempt has to do with punishment, not compliance.

I think

that in this particular case the punishment was severs, and the
appendices to the various briefs, the transcript references

11
wherein the district court judge discussed the penalties are
clear.

The counsel for the general counsel of the National

Labor Relations Board urged upon the court that this was a
very serious offense and urged that the union and Munis be
punished.

3692 clearly therefore would require a jury trial.

And we can see no way that, the plain meaning of the words
and the plain meaning of the statute can be evaded or avoided.
Indeed,, if the Solicitor were to prevail, if the Government
interpretation of 3692 were to prevail, Congress would have
engaged in a nullity.

The Act would have been totally void.

3692 is not a mere recodification of what previously had
existed in section .11 of Morris-LaGuardia, because at the time
that section 11 of Norr.is~LaGuard.ia was enacted, the broadened
scope of statutory chipping of the protections against
injunctive relief under Norris-LaGnardia had not yet occurred
or had not occurred in as full a measure.
a Ta£t~Hartley amendment.

Section 10(1) is

And the timing of the various

statutory provisions is important.

3692 was a 1948 enactment.

10(1) is a 3.947 enactment, so Congress knew about 10(1) at
the time they enacted that provision.

And there is much

discussion of the 1947 Mine Workers case which dealt with the
mine seisure situation.

The fact situation arose in 1946,

dealt with, a peculiar and special problem under a statute
which had not as yet been enacted as far as this case is
concerned, namely, 3692.

12
We would respectfully submit that the decision on
the statutory question of the court in the First Circuit in
Union Naclonal should be followed by this Court.
Thank you very much.

We will reserve the balance of

our time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 3URGER:

Very well.

Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BORK;
Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This case presents the question of the allowable social

response to a situation of widespread disorder coupled with
massive and egregious disrespect for a court order.

The

Gove .tnment submits that the contempt convictions of both
petitioners of criminal contempt was proper and neither was
entitled to a jury trial under the statute or by the
Constitution.
I v/ill return to the statutory argument in a moment,
but it is rather fully set forth in our brief.
*

We believe

■

that Congress quite deliberately designed its statute so that
the. Labor Board could meet situations like this rapidly.
Congress, I think quite reasonably, concluded that both
rabidity and firmness are needed and that when the Labor Board
is the moving party as distinct from an employer, that none
of the dangers presented against which Norris-LaGuardia was

13
directed are present.
But as I say, I would like to return to the statutory
argument in a moment.

But our constitutional argument is not

as fully set forth in our brief as I would like, and X would
like to modify it somewhat and develop it somev7hat here.
As stated in our brief our first constitutional
argiiment is that criminal contempt hearings do not require a
jury.

When the penalty is against a corporation or a union,

there can only be a fine, so there is no personal liberty
interest at stake.

Now, we continue to believe that that

distinction is an important one between a fine and a loss of
personal liberty and it is certainly felt to be quite important
throughout our society, both in terms of the individual
suffering and the degree of social disgrace inflicted.
But that distinction may not be enough by itself
to be adequate to the concerns of the Constitution in this
area.

And while we rely upon it as part of our total submission,

X wish to add other factors that I think in combination with
it are sufficient to show that Local 70 was not constitutionally
entitled to a jury trial.
The history of criminal contempt is well known and
throughout, of course, most of the history of this Court time
and again claims for jury trial as a constitutional right were
rejected.

Relatively recently in Bloom v. Illinois this Court

required a jury trial for contempt that resulted in two years

14
imprisonment.

Now, I stress the recentness of that decision,

not in order to suggest that it is not firmly established as
doctrine, but rather only to suggest that it is doctrine at
the beginning of its growth and evolution rather than at the
end.
*e

It is important to recognize, I think, that categories
of contempts are very different.

The offenses are very

different and the punishments are very different.

With respect,

to some, such as the one involved here where personal liberty
is not at stake and where I will suggest that the rationale of
the Bloom opinion does not quite fit, it should be constitu­
tionally permissible to retain the efficacy of contempt
proceedings in their historical form, that is, without a jury
trial.

Bloom, I think, rested upon two propositions.

The

first was that considerations which make a right to jury trial
fundamental for serious crimes are not substantially different
from those that apply to serious contempts.

And the second

'was that the argument for jury trial is either more compelling
in contempt cases because contemptuous conduct often strikes
at the most vulnerable and human qualities of a judge's
temperament.
The burden of my argument will be to show that there
are kinds of contempts that bring into play considerations
not present where statutory crimes are involved, and some of
these considerations are peculiar to certain contempts.

Sorae

of the arguments I will make distinguish all contempts from
all crimes.

Bloom v. Illinois said that was not enough.

But

I think when we add to that that some contempts are different
from other contempts, we are entitled to look at these
differences cumulatively and say that in certain categories
of contempts a jury trial may not be required — is not indeed
required.
QUESTION:
also?

And certain categories of defendants

In other words, is your argument, your constitutional

argument, such that it would lead to the conclusion that a
corporation is never entitled to a jury trial in a criminal
contempt* because a corporation by definition cannot be put
in prison?
MR. BORK:

I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, that I

would say that perhaps only in combination with the additional
factor that I wish to mention.

One can imagine fines so

large that perhaps they would be oppressive, but with these
additional factors present as safeguards, I think it resulted
in this case no jury trial was required.

I am going to

suggest —
QUESTION:

A corporation or a labor union.

MR. BORKs

Yes.

And I am going to suggest that we

are indeed, I trust, at the beginning of an evolutionary
development along this area, and I cannot for that reason make
tight line distinctions.

I think there are a variety of

16
factors to weigh.

X think they all point toward the

constitutionality of what took place here,

But these factors

which I am going to discuss are intended to respond affirma­
tively to the rationale of Bloom y, 111 1 nois and thereby meet
its rationale.
The first factor I will discuss distinguishes all
contempts from all crimes, and I think, as I say, we are all
entitled to consider it as well as the special factors.

And

that is simply that the penalty in a contempt case is subject
to judicial review, while the sentence in a criminal case
currently is not.

And that

important difference.

seems to me a very distinct and

It's a fundamental safeguard in

contempts guarding against passionate or prejudiced tribunals,
and that's not yet available to criminal defendants.
The remainder of the factors I v?ill mention distinguish
between kinds of criminal contempts as well as between contempts
and crimes.
QUESTION:
. •*.

But if a State statute or Federal statute

;
*

•-v-• - ..
' ■ V .1'.* 't''

specified the punishment for contempt.
MR. BOSK:

If it specified the punishment for contempt,

then I suppose we wonId have to take the -QUESTION:

Even within some limits.

I mean, although

there was a range of discretion, we would still have the
traditional rule of nonreviewability, then, I suppose.
MR. BORKs

I suppose not, but here we have a reviewafole

17
fine, and I think in cases where we do have a reviewable fine»
we certainly have a fundamental safeguard not available in a
criminal case which suggests less need for the jury trial.
The second consideration I want to mention is that
this case presents the kind of criminal contempt conviction
that can be effectively reviewed on a written record.

It

does not turn upon attitude or tons of voice or bearing toward
a judge in a courtroom which is impossible perhaps to recapture
on a written record.
r.£hird, tne offense to be enjoined and hence to be
punished for violation of a court order is not some vague
category like disrespectful behavior, but is instead a
statutorily defined unfair labor practice, a secondary boycott,
and its application to this particular case is made quite
clear by the order which is served upon the petitioner,
served upon the labor union. Local 21» and which petitioner
had to violate before any sanction became possible.

Petitioner

thus had much more advance warning of what conduct was
proscribed for him before he could be punished for violation
of that order.
The problem of the human and vulnerable qualities
of the judicial temperament mentioned in Bloom hardly arises
4

.

""

here because the conduct was not disrespect to or criticism
of a judge *

Rule 42 of the criminal rules that makes

particularised judgments of the kind we are talking about here,

18
and that of course is what X am seeking.
There is one other difference between contempts and
crimes that I find highly relevant.

Our legal order throughout

its range places greater importance upon the effectiveness
of court orders than it does upon the effectiveness of criminal
statutes.

If a man deliberately violates a statute under

the claim that it's unconstitutionalr should he establish
the unconstitutionality, he will go free.

But should the

sara© man knowingly violate a court order under the same claim
even if he establishes it's unconstitutionality, he may be
punished.

Cur legal order has always placed greater emphasis

upon the court order and its sanctity.
That being the case, it seems to me desirable that
the superior effectiveness of court orders be preserved for
some kinds of situations.

Otherwise, monetary sanctions that

are available may be wholly ineffective to prevent massive
and egregious violations of court orders in precisely those
cases where they are most needed and also to prevent the
destruction of rights and property of persons in the community.
When a court order is directed to a large organiza­
tion with widespread support in the community, it is entirely
possible that juries will not convict.

In such situations

there may be hung juries, either because of sympathy with the
law violators or because of fear of reprisal in that community.
Arid if the court is limited to imposing only very small fines

19
without a jury trial, the fines are likely to be imperceptible
to the organisation and the orders will deter little or nothing.
There may be arguments, I think, for the jury’s
power to nullify criminal statutes or it may be that that is
just a byproduct of our system and can't be helped.

But I

don't think nullification by jury ought to be permitted here.
It's certainly not appropriate in a context like this one,
given the factors I have mentioned, that is, the greater
importance of court orders, the fact that personal liberty is
not at hasard, and the safeguards available here that would
not be available in a criminal prosecution under a statute.
Thus, I think it results that if the Bloom decision
is applied according to its rationale, no jury trial was
required in the contempt proceedings here.

I think that's

perhaps all that needs to be said with respect to this case.
Perhaps I should add that what I am envisaging in applying the
Bloom decision according to its rationale and according to
these factors that must be weighed as they occur or do not
occur, is that we would enter upon a classical common law
development of doctrine in this area claiming these
considerations I have mentioned in various contexts, perhaps
identifying other considerations.
Now that, I think, is not an objection to the
Government's position.

I think it's rather its strength

because the process I described results in applying the

20
Constitution sensitively according to the policies that
s'*»**/:*$# i

« *• •

'

- 1

compete within the Constitution in this field, and I think
that * s better than applying the flat rule that sacrifices
important interests for nothing more than instant certainty.
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, would yotir argument

be the same if Mr. Munis had been sentenced to one year in
prison without probation?
•

I gather it would, wouldn't it?

■

’

MR. BORK;

No,- it would not, Mr. Justice Stewart.

. • '»

j'

I am talking now — Muniz has not raised the Constitution
issue.
QUESTIGN:

I know.

MR. BORK;

And we are accepting for this purpose

the distinction between imprisonment and fine.
QUESTION:

Imprisonment beyond 6 months at least.

MR. BORK:

That's right.

So that I would not be

arguing that no jury trial was required if Mr. Muniz was
sentenced to more than 6 months.
QUESTION:

You would not.

MR. BORK:

I would not be arguing that.

QUESTION:

Is part of your argument, General Borkf

based on the proposition that a fine is a less worrisome type
of sanction than imprisonment?
£r-'-:yj.i- - i

MR. BORK:

I think that that is part
of it.

1' don't

know that that would bo an adequate line of demarcation all by
itself because of the possibility of very heavy fines.

21

QUESTION?

Well, why is it any good at all, as a

matter of fact, when you look at the Seventh amendment that
requires a trial by jury for civil action where $20 or more is
involved and compare it with a jury trial provision
connection with a criminal case.

in

It seems like the framers

thought that the taking of money was probably just a3 serious
a sanction as putting someone in jail.
MR. BORK:

I doubt that that would be the reason, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, for the Seventh Amendment *

But in any case

we now allow the taking of money in large amounts without jury
trial.

Our brief discusses many administrative procedures

by which corporations, col1activities like this one, are
•>
assessed very large sums without the possibility of jury trials.
I don't think that’s unconstitutional.

And I think our

society does feel that there is a difference between imprisonment and fine.
QUESTION:

What's our society's feeling got to do with

the meaning of the Constitution?
MR. BORKj

Well, it's one way of asking ourselves

how much injury is inflicted upon a person.

Now, this Court

?

has said that for historical reasons it will, distinguish
between a 6-month prison term and a 6-month-and-one-day
prison term in terms of jury trials.

And 1 suppose it is

thereby drawing a line because a line has to foe drawn, hut the
longer the imprisonment becomes, the more suffering it inflicts

22

and the mors social disgrace it inflicts because of society’s
feeling about it.

And I am merely suggesting to you that there

is a distinction in degree in our perceptions,in society’s
feeling and indeed in the individual suffering when the penalty
is a fine rather than imprisonment.
But in any event, I think these other factors, I
suggest, also argue in the same direction.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, I gather none of

these factors argues, does it?
MR. BORK:

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION:

Do these factors, singly or in combination,

suggest unconstitutionality in a statute which requires jury
trial?
MR. BORK:

Not a bit.

Not a bit, Mr. Justice Brennan.

But in the absence of a statute, I am suggesting that they
constitute, but I don’t think there was a statute here that
required a jury trial.
QUESTION:

I know, but your emphasis I thought had

the sound of separation of powers, these being judicial orders
and —
MR. BORK:

Well, there may be occasions, Mr. Justice

Brennan, which I think we need not reach here, in which
Congress purportedly deprived the court of any ability to
function as a court, such a statute might be unconstitutional.
But I don't think we are discussing that range of considerations

23
in this case and I trust we never will have to discuss that
range of considerations. But it is useful to mention Congress
because the evolution I am discussing need not be entirely
judicial.

It's appropriate that Congress have its attention

refocused upon this problem and that we have legislative
judgments set into the process as we move toward a resolution
of this issue.
Now, our alternative submission on the constitutional
issue is quite fully developed in our brief.
touch upon it.

I will merely

It is that a $10,000 fine imposed upon a

large organisation like this one is obviously not so substantial
as to make the offense more than petty. The reliance upon
18 U.S.C. 13 about petty offenses X think is misplaced.

That

statute was passed about 1930 with totally different things
in mind, was not addressed to contempt.

And furthermore X

don't think that statute makes it possible to equate 6 months
imprisonment with $500 fine, particularly in view of the fact
that it goes on to say "or both".

So- that we would bs left

with the peculiar logic or proposition that you could impose
6 months plus $500, but not 6 months plus one day or $501
separately.
X think realism has to have its claim in tills field
of constitutional law, and it appears there are at least
13,000 people who paid dues to Local 70 or paid fees to
local 70.

And when we look at what that means, it comes out,

24
this fine comes out to about 30 cants per parson, per head.
And if the law is to correspond to reality in making distinctions
about what in severe and what is petty or serious and petty,
that factor I think has to be taken into account.

Indeed,

I think it’s dispositive.
I would like now to turn to the argument about the
statute because I think there cure two issues there, and the
first one is whether or not there was a distinction after
Tart-Hartley between cases where private employers sought an
injunction and start contempt and cases where the Labor Board
did.

And I think there wa3.

Norris-LaGuardia ruled the

first, and Taft-IIartley and Wagner Act the second.

And I think

there was no jury trial requirement there.
The second issue, then, is did the enactment of
18 U.S.C. 3692 suddenly wipe out the distinction thus laboriously
made.

And I x^ill not rehearse the entire history of these,

statutes as they caroe into effect.

But let rue say only this:

The evidence that just before 3692 was passed that there was
no requirement in the law that a Board order like this one, a
Board petition for an injunction which was violated, followed
by criminal contempt like this one, required a jury trial is
this:

The Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 in itself expressly

applied only to cases arising under this Act.
Workers

The United Mine

case shows that there were cases which did not arise

under Norris-LaGuardia.

Furthermore, the Wagner Act of 1935

/

25

in section 10(h) explicitly made every section of NorrisLaGuardia inapplicable, including specifically the jury trial
section of Norris-LaGuardia to court orders obtained by the
Board.

At the end of section 10(h) it cites every section of

Norris--LaGuardia as me.de inapplicable,
which is the jury trial provision.

including section 111,,

So there is no doubt that

after the Wagner Act Board orders are not governed by the
jury trial requirements of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.
Now, the Taft-Hartley Act in '47 not only retained
10(h) which governs 10(1) as well as 10(j) —
QUESTIONI

Does that include a suggestion that

Congress was asserting there should be. no jury trial in those
situations?
MR. BORK:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, I am saying that

it is quite plain from the evidence I am summarizing, beginning
with the arising out of language in Norris-LaGuardia, arising
under tinis Act, going on to the explicit statement in 10(h) of
the Wagner Act that all of the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia
i£ct, including section 111, don't apply to that section, which
shows that the jury trial requirement was lifted.

I am saying

in addition that 10(1) when it was enacted as part of the
r

Taft-Hartley Act speak3 of power to enjoin notwithstanding any
other provision of law, but perhaps more importantly left
10(h) standing.
Senator Ball

And we discuss in our brief the fact that
tried to amend section 10(1) saying that as

26

presently written., it completely lifted the Norris-LaGuardia
jury trial requirement,and he would put it hack in in part.
The Ball amendment was rejected.
In addition to that, there has been a consistent
course of practice and understanding by the Board and by all
kinds of people, including most courts up until quite recently,
25 years, in which everybody read this statutory scheme as
protecting against labor injunctions brought by employers.
That, after all, was the ev^'l at which Norris-LaGuardia was
aimed.

And after the Labor Board came into effect, that evil

v;as no longer necessary to be guarded against.

Congress laid

down the guidelines of what could be done and what could not
be done, and the Labor Board was expected to operate fairly
within those guidelines.

Hence, the relaxation of Norris-

LaGuardia safeguards when the Labor
fi

Board was involved.
■

But given those factors, I don't think there can bo
any doubt that just prior to the enactment of 3692

Labor

Board-sought injunctions did not require jury trials for
criminal contempt proceedings.

or comment or even notation that it had been done,

I think

27
that's simply not credible, ant' until recently, for over 25
years no court thought it was credible.

And certainly the

people who recodified title 18 to bring section 11 of the
Norris-LaGuardia Act into title 18 do not seem to have noticed
that they were making any sweeping change in the law, because
all of the revisers’ notes go extensively into noting and
explaining changes in substantive lav;.

Nothing of the sort

X think it is utterly

implausible to argue that a major change in the nation's
labor policy was made in that way.

And therefore, X think

it should take extraordinarily plain and indeed compelling
language to reach petitioners* result.

And the language of

3692 does not meet that te3t.
The language is not so plain that one can afford
to ignore its legal context.
from No iris-LaGusrdia.

We know it was taken directly

And the revisers must have thought it

entirely natural to refer to the same subject matter in the
terms that Norris-LaGuardia employs, that is a case involving
or growing out of a labor dispute.

That's Norris-LaGuardia

language and that context suggests they thought they were
transplanting laws, not suddenly swallowing up distinctions
made in the Wagner Act and in the Taft-Kartley Act.
QUESTION:

The substitution, the substituted

language is much broader, though, isn't it, than section 11
initially?

Section 11 was just cases arising under this Act,

28

meaning Ndrris-LaGaaxdia, wasn't it?
MR. BORK:

They repealed — for this purpose they

repealed section 11 and picked if up and put it over in title 18
and it can no longer be cases arising under this Act.
QUESTION:

That's right.

But the substitution

"arising under the laws of the United States governing the
issuance of injunctions or restraining orders in any case
'4 *r

involving or growing out of a labor dispute."

That's the new

language, isn't it, substitute language.
MR. BORK:

So that the new language, Mr. Justice

Brennan, is a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute,
which is NorrIs-LaGuardia language.
QUESTION:

You think that is what limits it.

MR. BORK:

I think it has to.

For one thing, you

get a distinction that doesn't make much sense if you read
the statute the way the petitioners do.

That is this:

Not

all labor disputes — labor disputes and unfair labor practices
are not coterminus terms.

You can have an unfair labor practice

quite clearly without a labor dispute.

The reading here is

that any case which is not a labor dispute but there is an
unfair labor practice, you can get an injunction and a trial
for criminal contempt without a jury.
a labor dispute, you can't.

But if it also involves

I don't think that makes — that's

a difference that doesn't make a great deal of sense.
The reading we give 3692 says that you get a jury

29

trial when an employer is trying to get an injunction and
tv/ you for contempt, but not when the Labor Board does.

that*s a distinction that makes policy sense.

And

And in fact

tine distinction that the 80th Congress which passed TaftHartley made the year before.

And it was also the 80th Congress

that voted in 3692, which is another reason why it's impossible
to believe that the 80th Congress didn't even mention the
change they were making.
But in our brief we point to the fact that
Representative Seller

who had been chairman of the committee

considering this title 13 some 10 years later rather heatedly
denied that he had made the jury trial provision applicable
to Taf t-IIartley

in 3692.

I think I should raise one warning signal.

Petitioners’

argument proceeds upon a flat, mechanical, and rather simplis­
tic reading of language which has context and growth and has
meaning.

If that method of reading 3692 were accepted, this

Court would then very shortly be faced V7ith the claim that by
the same kind of reading of the plain language, no civil
contempts require jury trials,

because this language doesn't

distinguish between civil and criminal contempts.
read it without context, that's what happens.

If you

Furthermore,

it would turn out that no matter how small the fine, $3. fine
requires a jury trial for contempt of a court order if you
accept this flat mode of reading the statute, which I say is

30

totally foreign to its history and to its context.
So X suggest that the statute should net be read
that mechanically and v/ithout regard to context or evidence,
so that major congressional policies are destroyed on no basis
than what can be called a rather simplistic semanfcicism, and
we ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Van Bourg?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR J. VAN BOURG
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. VAN BOURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, just if I can for

a moment, I believe I have a few minutes left.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. VAN BOURG:

Yes, you do.

I think that it is inappropriate to

state, as the Solicitor has stated, that if the Court were to
adopt the posture taken by the First Circuit in Union Nacional,
that you would be making a major change in the nation's labor
policy.

The nation's labor policy is first enunciated in 1932

in enacting Norris-LaGuardia, saying courts do not interfere
with the peaceful processing of labor disputes between labor
and management.

And then in 1935 by enacting the Wagner Act,

and then in the mass of amendments of 1947 and Taft-Hartley,
at no time did Congress set a labor policy dealing with the
question of jury trials in criminal contempts.
The Code of Criminal Procedure, the Constitution of

■the United States, the question of jur/ trial was not
conceived as part of a national labor policy at any time by the
Congress of the United States-

They didn’t presume that the

Wagner Act or Taft-Hartley trenched upon notions of jury trialAnd X am troubled by the fact that the Solicitor General
is arguing against the concept and the notion of a jury trial
on the constitutional side using the arguments that have been
traditionally used that juries cannot see these things clearly,
they may have sympathy toward the accused or they may be
frightened of the accused.
The context of this case arises in a metropolitan
area of some 4 million people in the San Francisco Bay area.
I don’t think that we have that kind of evidence that the
juries would be so blind to the facts.

And this is precisely

the kind of case in which a jury trial is necessary because
the judge may have been unable to determine the facts that had
to be determined to protect the accused.
Why do I say that?

The Solicitor glosses over the

that important?

But why is

Why should that fact even be argued or

32
pointed out?

Itfs because the whole process of a 10(1)

injunction is started by the filing of an unfair labor practice
charge by a person, individual, or employer or another labor
organization.

After the charge is filed, the Regional

Director, if he has reasonably concluded that an unfair labor
practice may have been committed and determines to issue a
complaint before the National Labor Relations Board, may seek
a petition under section 10(1) against the labor organization
against whom the charge was filed.

It is that determination,

subjective and factual determination, that is made by the
Regional Director that starts the process of petitioning the
district court for an injunction under section 10(1) .
In this case there was no unfair labor practice
charge filed against Local 70.

There was no unfair labor

They ware given no

And at the time of the contempt trial

and at the time of the adjudication, both civil and criminal,
the Board still had not made them parties and they had never
been served, and counsel for the general counsel when he argued
the case conceded that they had never been served with the
underlying papers.

And yet the conditions precedent to the

the finding of knowledge, notice, and intent to deliberately
avoid or violate the injunctione
QUESTION:

We did grant here, did we not, to exclude

question one which raises —
MR. VAN BOURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

So that's not before us.

MR. VAN BOURG:

No, it is not.

I think, however, that

the arguments on the social policy of the country require that
if an argument is made that this is not the kind of a case
which would require a jury trial, I submit it is precisely
the kind of a case where there are factual questions to be
determined, i.e., notice, knowledge, intent to violate.

And

I would like to just conclude by one other item.
It is true that the Labor Board is expected, as are
all Government agencies expected, to act fairly in the seeking
of injunctions and enforcing them.

If the civil contempt

procedure is designed to vindicate the court's order and to
show its compliance and the jury question in a civil contempt
matter is not before the Court, and if the criminal contempt
procedure is designed to punish lather than to vindicate and
seek compliance of the court's order, then it makes no sense
to give either a restricted constitutional determination of the
right to a jury trial, which after all is fundamental in this
society if we are talking about societal views, nor a restrictive

34
meaning other than the plain meaning of the statuto under
section 3692.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
