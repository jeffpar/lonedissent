MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74-1492, Washington against Davis.
Mr. Sutton, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID P. SUTTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SUTTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At its threshold this case presents two highly
important societal values—-the right of a community to be
free from discrimination in public employment and the right
of a commmunity to a competent police force.

It is our

position that both of these values may be rationally upheld
in this case.
Such a prelude necessarily leads to a statement of
the basic issues involved.

At the time the certiorari

petition came before this Court, the issues were two in number.
First, whether the Metropolitan Police Department’s Test 21,
its entrance test, has an adverse racial impact.

And,

secondly, whether that test is rationally related to one's
ability to be trained as a policeman.
Late in the proceedings before this Court, the
Federal Government has injected a third issue into the case,
and that is whether or not this Court may adequately deal
with the case on the existing summary judgment record which

4
came to it» as opposed to remanding the case to the district
court so that we may begin all over again»
1 would like to take up these issues individually»
In essence» our position is that Test 21 does not have a
racially disproportionate impact.
related.

In any event, it is job

And that a remand, as suggested by the Federal

Government, would serve no useful purpose and would indeed
subvert the interests of judicial economy.

I will turn

briefly to the impact issue.
We do not ask this Court to single out any one
factor in dealing with

the impact issue.

It is our position

that there are four factors or four equal employment badges
of credibility which conclusively negate an adverse impact,
and that these factors may find support in this Court's
decision.
First, vigoroiis minority recruitment.

There is no

question that since Chief Wilson took office in 1969, the
department has vigorously, aggressively, unwaveringly sought
to recruit blacks into the department and has succeeded.
Let us talk about the applicant pool.

In this

Court's most recent decision on the subject, Albemarle Paper
Co» v. Moody, this Court spoke in terms of a test which has
a racial pattern significantly different from that of the
pool of applicants.

For the two most recent years for which

statistics are available, 1970 and 1971, 53 percent of all

5
the applicants were black, and 43 percent of all the new
policemen ware black.
tion.

We have a ten percent under-represent.a

We submit this does not indicate an adverse impact,

but we do not ask the Court to stop here.

We have two more

badges of credibility.
First, we may fairly compare those in the 20 to 2S
age category hired by the department, the eligibles, 44
percent between 1969 and the time the Court ruled.
Q

That is a total of 44 percent of all the

applicants of all races were hired?
MR. SUTTON:

No, 44 percent of all the applicants

were black.
Q

1 see.

MR. SUTTON;

Fifty-four percent.

But this must be

compared, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart, with the blacks
in felie standard metropolitan statistical area, which is
considerably lesser than the 50-mil® radius from which the
department recruits.

The 3MSA or Stantadrd Metropolitan

Statistical Area figures applicable to this ag® group in
1970, the time this case was pending, were 24 percent; so,
we double that.
But again we d© not ask the Court to stop there.

I

would like to borrow on this Court’s very language in Griggsand this I think is
tests.

perhaps one of the most important impact

In Griggs this Court emphasised that the question is

6

not on© of intentional discrimination; it's a question of a
practice which is neutral on its face but which has the effect
of locking in or freezing a racially unacceptable status
quo.

It is for that reason that the Court said in Griggs

that under the Civil Rights Act practices, procedures or
tests neutral on their face and even neutral in terms of
intent cannot be maintained if they operate to

freeze the

statis quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.
How about a test that does the opposite?

The

record does show in this case that in 1965, which c©inci­
dentally was fch@ effective date of the Civil Rights Acts,
Title VII, the department11 s black component was 17 percent.
The record showed that that component spiraled overwhelmingly.
The record shows, for example, that between 1967 and 1970,
the black component of the department increased 228 percent.
The white component, 47 percent.
Recent statistics which are in a report prepared
by the District Human Rights Office, which will soon be
available—it is on the

Mayor's desk right now—shows that

presently the department's black component is 41.2 percent.
This is the opposite of status quo freezing.

Instead of

locking in a discriminatory practice of yesteryear, this
dissipates any taint that could arguably exist between what
went on

in the past and what went on now.

Court to consider any one of these factors.

We do not ask the
We ask the Court

7
to consider the totality of the factors, and we respectfully
submit that if the Court does this, the Court will find that
no adverse impact exists.
I would now like to turn to job relatedness, and I
would like to spend as much time as I can on the late
contention of the federal respondents that this Court cannot;
deal with the matter on the existing record for want of
available psychological data.
First of all, again we begin with the Albemarle
pronouncement.

This Court in Albemarle

said that in

essence it will consider two factors on job relatedness,
that job relatedness is a contextual matter.

It must be

considered in the context of the employer's operation, first
of all, and, secondly, in the history of the testing
program.
Let us rake the employer's operation, which
necessarily requires that we focus on a policeman's job.
What kind of job are we talking about?

The policeman of

today is not the village constable of yesteryear.
performs in an age of evolving legal concepts.

He lives and

He must

*

necessarily have some kind of knowledge or familiarity with the
laws of arrest, stop and frisk, search and seizure? this is
i

the age of Miranda v„ Arizona and Terry v. Ohio.
Then too the policeman must have some kind of basic
understanding of the components or constituent elements of the
I

8
various criminal offensas with which he will be concerned
when ha walks his beat.

He must be reasonably skilled in

report writing. In the language of the dissenting judge in
the court bslcw, he must be articulate.

In the language of

this Court in Albemarle, he must have job specific ability.
The department's training curriculum, which is
before this Court, discusses all these areas as matter
which recruits should be exposed to—arrest, search, seizure,
et cetera, et cetera.

And for that reason we respectfully

submit it is designed to impart the kind of job-specific
ability that this Court referred to in the Albemarle case.
Obviously one needs verbal ability to understand
these materials, to understand the law of arrest, search, and
seizure.

It is undisputed that Test 21 is a straightforward

test of verbal ability.

The test requires a job-specific

ability that is training related on its face ars Judge Robb so
held.

We could stop there, if we wanted to, but we do not

have to because we have considerably more than that.
I would now like to turn to the second contextual
criterion.
Q

What did the majority hold about Test 21?

are talking about the dissenting opinion.

What did the

majority opinion hold?
MR. SUTTON:

They said in essence, as we sea it,

that it does not predict trainability.

They took question

You

or issue with its cutoff score of 40, and they stressed the
fact that since nobody failed recruit school, we could not
use it»
I think that this comes in rather nicely with the
history of the testing program and that will tell us an
awful lot with respect to the fairness or—
Q

Is the test geared to policemen?

No, it is not.

Right?
MR. SUTTON:

It is not geared to policemen,

Mr. Justice Marshall, but it is particularly suited to
policemen because it is geared to the high school graduate.
And respondents concede that a high school education is
sufficient, is required, to be a policeman.

Authoritative

study throughout the country, including the President's
Crime Commission, take a similar position.
generally geared to any

While it is

job which in turn requires a high

school education, we respectfully submit it is peculiarly
\

suitable tc this job.

When studies galore insist upon a

policeman having not a high school education but mor@--some
people would say a college degree—we do not have ..to go that
far in this case.
Q

Mr. Sutton, the Court would never get to this

question if you are right in your first point; is that not
correct?
MR. SUTTON:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

10

Q

If there is no adverse racial impact, then any

inquiry into the job relatedness of the tests is never
reached.
MR. SUTTON;

That is correct, although we would

welcome a holding of job relatedness, we can understand why
the Court might not want to make one.
Q

If the Court does agree with you on your first

argument, that is the end of the case.
MR. SUTTON:
Q
it is.

Is it not?

I submit that it is.

Under our decisions construing the statute,

Is it not?
MR. SUTTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Turning to the history, this test with a cutoff
score of 40 correct out of 80, which is a 50 percent passing
score really, has been in existence for over 20 years.

It

was not ushered in on the effective date of the 1965 Civil
Rights Act like the test in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. in which
there was almost intentional discrimination.
conducted in 1967.

The study was

It was not conducted as a last ditch

effort to avoid back pay when the specter of back pay was
raised on the eve of trial as was the study conducted in
Albemarle Paper Company and which the federal respondents seam
to think is the controlling precedent in the context of remand.
Unlike the study in Albemarle, it did not involve whites only;
it involved members of both races.

The record shows that there

11
is an across-the-board relationship for both races between
test scores and recruit school averages.

And hence it

predicts trainability.
It was not based on subjective supervisorial
ratings as was the situation in Albemarle.
objective criteria.

It was based upcn

It was based upon test-to-test

correlation which even the American Psychological Association
recognises as acceptable.
Q

Does not everybody pass recruit school?

1s

that not. indicated somewhere in the record?
MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, the record indicates that

everybody does ultimately pass recruit school, but everybody
does not pass recruit school tests.
At page 102 of the Appendix, Futransky shows that
he considered the fact that some fail.

At pages 181 and 182

of the Appendix, it is pointed out that the Futransky study
was based on the first taking of the test.

If we were to

consider this as an adverse factor, it would give the
department a disincentive for working with people who other­
wise would.not make recruit school.
at best--! mean, at worst.

It is a neutral factor

At best the positive factor would

show an employer's sensitivity to members of both races.
But the point that I really want to make is that
the federal respondents9 contention that tills case should be
remanded—because I think it involves a matter that strikes

12

at the very heart of what this type of litigation is all
about—involves an important policy question concerning the
extent to which this Court and other federal courts should
rely upon psychological data in decision making.
What they say, first of all, is that whether or not
there is a relationship or a nexus between the content of
the recruit school curriculum and a policeman's job is a
matter which should be decided by psychologists. Until such time
as the psychological record is built up, this Court is
*

incapable of dealing with the matter on the existing record.
We respectfully submit that this contention is baseless and
will lead to all kinds of difficulty.

This Court has imposed

many of the requirements for a policeman's job throughout the
years.

This Court has written the description for the job,

in a manner of speaking.
question of whether

This Court's expertise on the

a recruit school curriculum is related

to a police officer's job we submit is entitled to more
credence than a ton of psychological studies.
Q

Are we arguing as to whether it is a question

for this Court as opposed to the district or this Court as
opposed to psychologists or the district court as opposed te
psychologists?

1 presume it is basically a fact question,

is it not?
MR. SUTTON:
basis, Your Honor.

I think it is a question of rational

I think it is a question of a narrow

13
Standard of review»

This Court can view the recruit school

cirri culum, apply it to what it knows about a. policeman's
job and standards as a rational relationship.

The question

of whether there is a connection between what a recruit learns
at recruit school and what he does on the job is a legal one,
not a psychological one.

I think the same would hold true cf

a bar examination, for example.

If this Court had before it

a bar examination and the question was whether because less
blacks pass it it is related to the practice of law, I do not
think this Court would want to remand-*-or I would hope or
submit that, this Court would not want to remand a case like
for psychological proof as to whether the bar exam relates
to the job of a lawyer.
Q

It seems to me you can make your point, we

can agree, without feeling that this Court is the forum in
first instance that ought to make

these decisions as opposed

to the district court.
MR. SUTTON:

But federal counsel would have the

district court put the District to its psychological proof
to have a balancing of the evidence test, to have psycholo­
gists take the stand and testify as to what a policeman's
job is like.
Q

We submit there is no need for that.
1 think you would argue on better ground if you

said it is because it is a question of fact for the district
court, not because it is a question of rational basis for

14
•this Court.
MR. SUTTON:
Your Honor.

I would even be reluctant to say that,

I do not feel that in this area we need to have

questions of fact in the sense that we have to put on evidence
on both sides of the scale and build up a massive record.

I

think it would subvert the interests of judicial economy.

I

think though there must be some jobs where we could just
introduce job descriptions and training curricula and
provide a sufficient basis for summary judgment ruling.
Q

Are you suggesting that a district judge of

the United States District Court who is dealing with search
and seizure and Fourth and Fifth Amendment and Terry Case
and Miranda is better able to make an evaluation of what it
takes to make a policeman than some clinical psychologist is
able to make?
MR. SUTTON:
Honor.

That is exactly my position, Your

And I only add to that that if we can take a contrary

position with respect to policemen, how far are we going to
carry this?

Are we going to apply it to claims examiners

who deal with welfare regulations, training program in the
context of what these regulations are about, administrative
law judges, bar examinations?

But I want to emphasize at the

same time we are not suggesting that this Court lay down a
rule for all seasons.

We ask this Court for a very narrow

rule; at least, in so far as this job is concerned, the

15
Standard of review should be narrow.

Thera axe many private

jobs that this Court does not have much knowledge of because
of the complex society in which we live, and we submit that
the employer should be put to his psychological proof.

He

should call in psychological testimony--jobs involving
textile mills, if you will; jobs such as those involved in
the Albemarle Paper Company.
be

I think that that question can

fleshed out with the passage of time or we take each job

as it comes.

1 wish to emphasize there are many jobs where

the employer should be put to a psychological proof.
Q

Do you assume we know what gees on in the

police academy?
MR. SUTTON:
before the Court.

Your Honor, we have the curriculum

The curriculum shows what is taught there.

And this Court knows that what is taught there ties in with
what a policeman does because this Court constantly reviews
matters.
Q

Do you know of any of us that have been to a

police academy?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

1 have bat do you know many others that have?

MR. SUTTON:
Q
nine.

Perhaps you have not, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

There is one, there is two.

There is two out. of

That is a good batting average, I guess.
Q

Not here in the District.

16
Q

And mine is not here in the District either.,

Q

Mr. Sutton, before you go on, this suit was

brought in 1970, alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment,
the equal protection aspect of the Fifth Amendment, and 1961.
You seem to be arguing the case on the assumption that Title
VII applies.

Was the complaint ever amended?

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor, it was not.

But the

district court made Title VII applicable by analogy, in the
equal protection kind of way, and we think that is fair.

We

think that the public employers should certainly—maybe not
minutely meet all the Title VII standards but should substan­
tially comply with Title VII, even the District was not
included within Title VII at the time.
Q

Do you think the standards applicable under

the Equal Protection Clause are identical to the standards
applicable under Title VII?
A

I do not think they are. Your Honor.

Q

Do you think all you have to show under the

Equal Protection Clause would be a discriminatory impact?
A

I would say they are pretty close, though.

And

I think that the question is probably academic because we've
gone further in this case than any Title VII private employee
would go.
Q

In other words, you are making no distinction

between Equal Protection and Title VII in this case?

17
MR, SUTTON;

No, Your Honor, because quite frankly

we think the substance of Title VII has been complied with.
The Civil Service Commission has issued regulations pursuant to
Title VII.
&PPiy*

We are now involved in Title VII.

It now does

So, for all practical purposes in the future we are

involved.

But I would make this distinction.

In connection

with the guidelines, the Chief Justice pointed out in
Albemarle

that the guidelines are not regulations promulgated

pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act and hence they
differ in that respect.
Now, these regulations that the Civil Service
Commission has promulgated were, and they should be entitled
to more weight than the g\aidelines, and they specifically
validate this test.
The only other point I would make before sitting
down is that the federal respondents make a second point, that
unless this Court has the recruit school examinations that
were given in 1963—-and that is when they were given—-or
evidentiary explication of the contents of those examinations,
there are no criteria, in the measurements and sence the Court
is incapable of dealing with the cas© on the existing record
before it.

We make no bone about it.

examinations.

We do not have those

They are not available.

of the examinations be reconstructed.
never raised in the district court.

Nor can the contents
But this point was

This point was not

18

raised by the federal respondents.

We submit that a presump­

tion of regularity should apply, particularly since we know
from the D.C» Crime Commission's report that the professors
or instructors that prepare the examination were generally
competent, they did a good job.

There is nothing suspicious

or unusual in this case which suggests that the examinations
were not calculated to assess mastery of what was taught.
And we think if at this late date the Court should accept
the federal respondents contention and penalize the employer
when those who challenge the test could care less about the
exams—they were content to focus their whole argument on
whether the test predicts job performance--that this would be
to unjustly penalize the Civil
District of Columbia.

Service Commission and the

Essentially it is a question of laches

and the presumption of regularity.
Nobody can take issue with the notion that we live
in an age in which an evolving body of law has made a police­
man 3 s job more corap lex.

We submit then that it is only fair

that a modern day police department be permitted to ensure
that those recruits that it would hire have the necessary
degree of verbal ability to learn the basic tools of the
police trade.
We submit that the Metropolitan Police Department
has done this while at the same time boasting an equal
employment opportunity record which is one of the very best

19

in the nation if not the best in the nation»

As Judge Gesell

said, the Metropolitan Police Department has been a clear
example of bridging racial barriers.
We ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals.

More than that, we ask this Court

to permit the summary judgment ruling of the district court
to stand.

And I shall save the rest of my time for rebuttal

if the Court has no further questions.
Q

Before you do, Mr. Sutton, will you address

yourself to the second paragraph on 4(a) of your petition
of the Court's opinion in which it points out the number who
failed Test 21.

I thought this case was about Test 21.

MR. SUTTON %

Your Honor, there is no question--and

we do not hide the fact—that considerably more blacks failed
Test 21 than passed it.

We submit that that is a factor to

be considered in conjunction with other factors.
Q

Is that not enough to trigger?

MR. SUTTON;

We submit that that is not enough to

shift the burden of proof.

This Court in the Albemarle case

put the question more so ©n the basis of overall hiring
results rather than on the basis of test results.
Q

Doss that not put any responsibility on you?

MR. SUTTON;

Q
to ask you.

I think it is a factor.

It does put responsibility on you, and I want
Have you met it other than the generalization

20
this is the greatest police department in the country?
MR. SUTTON;

If

Your Honor’s question is to put

responsibility upon us, if Your Honor’s question is, Does
that ipso facto shift the burden of showing-Q

Yes.

MR. SUTTON:
Q

My answer is no.

What does it do, nothing?

MR. SUTTON:

No.

It is a factor to be considered

by the Court in connection with many other factors.
Q

Does that not give you a burden of moving

forward?
MR, SUTTON:

We submit that it does not.

It would

perhaps if we did not have the other badges of credibility
that are depicted by this record.
Q

Such as this is the greatest police department

in the country?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

No.

You do not want me to give any weight to that

now, do you?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

No.

Aggressive recruitment?

I mean, you say this is the greatest thing,

like somebody saying this is the greatest police department.
There are a lot of people who dispute that.
Q

I did. not understand him to say it was the

greatest police department but that you had the best record on

21

racial matters of any metropolitan police department in the
country.
MR. SUTTON;
Q

Yes, Hr. Chief Justice.

And who said that?

MR. SUTTON;

Judge Gesell said that it has been

a nationwide model for bridging racial barriers.
Q

And what facts were in the record on that?

MR. SUTTON:

There was a New York Times article

which compares with other departments, Your Honor.
Q

The New York Times is an authority for what?

All the news that is fit to print.
MR. SUTTON;

There are many other cases, Your Honor,

that show worse track records, and counsel has cited a
plethora of these cases in his brief.

I never read a case

that shows a police department with a better equal employment
record.

If there is one,

about it.

maybe counsel can tell this Court

If there is one, we would respectfully submit

there would not be very many.
Q

Then I ask you another question.

Is the fact

that this is the best, make it automatically exempt from
inquisition?
MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

We must rely upon the

totality--Q

Whether or net it applies under Article VII?

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor, wa must--

22

Q

That is this case.

MR. SUTTON;

Right.

of these statistical data.

We must rely upon the totality

But 1 think it should be counter­

balanced with this Court's pronouncement in one of its
cases, statistics tell much and courts listen.

We submit

there are overwhelming statistical data in this record which
apart from the statement of having a good track record, will
negate the adverse impact, and we say this notwithstanding
the pass/fail rate.
Q
If

Mr. Sutton, could I ask just one question:

you assume that the burden shifted by showing the racial

impact, what do you understand that the defendant's burden
is?
MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, I understand, first of all,

it is very light because job relatedness is a contextual
consideration, and there is a Harvard Law Review article on
this wa cite in our brief which dovetails nicely with
Albemarle.

One of the factors that should lighten the

employer's burden is the insubstanti11fcy of the impact, if
impact there be.
Q

I am not sure you are answering my question.

Assume there is a shift in the burden.
MR. SUTTON:
Q

Right.

What do you understand that the defendants

must prove in order to shoulder their burden?

23
MR. SUTTON:

That Test 21 is related to one’s

ability to be trained as a policeman.
Q

Do you contend that you have met that burden

if you prove that the test establishes verbal ability?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

And

We do, Your Honor.

so your position is that the record shows

that the verbal ability is established and verbal ability is
a component of job performance?
MR. SUTTON:

No.

Verbal ability is needed to

succeed in the police training academy.
Q

Is it also needed in order to be an adequate

police officer?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

Is that your position?

MR. SUTTON:
Q

It. is, Your Honor.

That is our position, but we do.

not--

In other words, you say if the record estab­

lishes that the test is a measure of verbal ability, you win?
MR. SUTTON:

Right.

We are not asking the Court

to go so far as to say that verbal ability relates to the
job after recruit school, although we think it does, as Judge
Robb said.

We think we can structure a much narrower rule.
Q

Do you think that independently you should

prevail because in terms of actual hiring your recruitment
program produces a police force that racially mirrors the
community in terms of division between the blacks and whites?

24
MR. SUTTON:

1 think we should.

If you view the

community as the District of Columbia itself, perhaps it
might be one thing.

Your Honor's question—
Let us assume that tv;ice as many blacks as

At the time the case was tried, Title VII was not applicable

Of course, we realize that they have not been

But it meets most

of th© features of the guidelines.
Q

When did Title VII become applicable to the

District, 1972?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

1372, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, yes, sir.

Let me ask one question because your opposition

does not stress it.

Is it not true that of those passing the

test, a larger percentage of Negroes was hired than of whites?
Of those passing the test.
MR. SUTTON:

I would have to say no.

But I would

say locally a larger number of Negroes was hired than whites
over the nine months period that is referred to in the affi­
davit of the department's administrative services officer.

26

I would have to say no.

A larger percentage of Negroes was

not hired, but a larger number was locally.

And we refer to

the affidavit of the department's administrative services
officer contained at pages 66 and 80 of the Appendix.
We point out--it just relates locally now—-during the
final six months of 1969 as Chief Wilson took office and during
the first three months of 1970—-let us take the latter, the
first nine months of 1970.

I think it was 504 blacks and 401

whites.
Q

Were hired?

MR. SUTTON:
failed the test.
Q

Were hired, yes.

But more blacks

There is no dispute about that.

I know, but Mr. Justice Biackmun’s question

was the percentage of those passing.
MR. SUTTON:

Perhaps that is so.

Q

That is his question.

Q

My question is, taking now just those who pass

and the hires from that pool of passers, is not the percentage
of Negroes hired greater than the percentage of-MR. SUTTON:

I have got your question now.

And your opponent makes no -mention of this —

MR. SUTTON:

No.

Q

--as X read his brief , anywhere»

He concen­

trates entirely on those taking the test, not on those

who

pass it.
MR. SUTTON:

In the language of the Sixth Circuit in

the Smith case, which X understand is now pending before this
Court, the impact should be on overall hiring results, not on
test results considered in isolation.
Q

A while ago you said that—or did you say this?-

of you take racial components

into consideration in choosing

from the eligible pool, it violates Title VII.
MR. SUTTON:
Q

No, it does not violate Title VII.

You mean quotas do but that does not.

MR. SUTTON:

If it turns out in a way that there

are more blacks working for the department.
Q

So, let us suppose that 500 blacks pass the

test and 500 whites pass the test, and you hire 400 blacks
and 100 whites.

Is that consistent with Title VII?

MR. SUTTON:
have a merit system.

You have another problem here.

You

You have a system where the persons

with the highest scores get the job.

That does not enter

into consideration her® because at the time this test was given

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Sutton.

Mr. Evans.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS
Q

Mr. Evans, before you commence, I would like to

go back to the question I asked.

How did Title VII get into

this case, and do you think it is properly here?
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Justice Powell, I think that in

essence the standards are the same under Title VII as they
are under the equal protection concept.
Q

May I ask you a question there.

Let us assume

this were an equal protection case mid nothing else, when would
the burden shift?

29

MR. EVANS;
Q

I think at the same point.

.All you would have to prove under straight

equal protection analysis is that mathematically more whites
were passing this test than blacks?
MR. EVANS:

I think the same analysis that this

Court adopted in Griggs under Title VII ought properly—
Q

Griggs was not an Equal Protection case.

MR. EVANS:

That is right, it was a Title VII case,

but I believe that the—
Q

What about Geduldig, that was an Equal

Protection case; what standard was applied in that case?
MR. EVANS:

There is some question as to whether

there was a discrimination found in that case or not.
Q

But you are saying that all one has to show

in an Equal Protection case is a mathematical impact that
can be construed as discriminatory?
MR. EVANS:

I am not sure I would be prepared to

generalise quite so far, Mr. Justice Powell, but I think in
the context of the testing challenge, it is reasonable to
make the same analysis that the Court made under Title VII.
I mean, the basic standard is tha same.

Title VII prohibits

discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, and religion.
Q

Mr. Evans, in Jefferson v. Hackney we said that

statistics standing alone were not sufficient.
MR. EVANS:

Not sufficient for™-

Not sufficient to make out an Equal Protection

Claim in the absence of a finding of intent to discriminate.

That may be a little different question.

have to prove, no intent?

Let

What would the other side

That is really the question as

between Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.

Is it

enough to prove an Equal Protection violation if there is no
intent but there is an unequal impact?

I guess you think

that it is.
MR. EVANS:
Q

I think that is right.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist just cited you a case.

What do you say about that?
MR. EVANS:

I frankly have not addressed myself

to this question because it has not been—
Q

Why is it important?

I mean, Title VII is

applicabis* now to the District;, is it not?
MR. EVANS:

That is right.

And for the future, Title

VII standards govern for all public employers.
Q

So, it might be quite important in another

context, but it is at leasts arguable here that we should
apply a Title VII standard?
MR. EVANS:

That is the way I thought about the

case and I guess the way the parties have approached it, that
this is basically a Title VII case.

While I have not thought

through all the ramifications of applying a standard Griggs

31
analysis to a case which was brought at the time when Title
VII was not yet applicable to the District,, given the nature
of the issue for the future, I think if is appropriate for
the Court to treat it that way since the parties

have been

prepared to treat, it that way.
Q

Was the complaint based wholly on the Equal

Protection Clause of th© Constitution?
MR. EVANS:
Q

Wholly on that and 1981.

MR. EVANS:
Q

I believe it was., yes.

1981.

But subsantively upon the Equal Protection

component of th© Fifth Amendment and not at all upon statute?
MR. EVANS:
Q

That is correct.

Was the complaint ever amended?

MR. EVANS:

I do not believe it was.

that there is one ether complicating factor.

I should add
And that is

that 'there is a statute which can fa© read as requiring the
Civil Service Commission to ensure that all of its tests are
job related regardless of any adverse impact.

The application

of that statute to this case was viewed by the Court of
Appeals as not presented by this case, and it may wall be
that the same job relatedness burden would fall upon the
defendants in this case in any event as a public employer.
Q

If there is a statute requiring the commission

to be sure that all of its tests are job related tests. Unless

32
there is an attack upon that, cannot one assume that the
commissioners have followed the law?

Does that not help the

defendants in this case?
MR. EVANS:

I think there is an attack on it, at

least to the point of shifting the burden to the defendants
to come forward with some proof.
be carried so far.

The presumption can only

Where the plaintiffs have established a

dramatic adverse racial impact of the test, I think it is
fair to impose upon the defendants the burden of at least
presenting evidence showing that indeed the burden of proving
job relatedness has been met.
Q

Mr. Evans, could I ask you the same question

I asked your opponent:

Just precisely what is the burden?

Do you contend they have failed to prove that the test
establishes verbal ability or that verbal ability is not a
component of the policeman's job?
MR. EVANS:

The analysis does not really focus so

much, Mr. Justice Stevens, on vcjrbal ability.

It is true

that this test was designed-—Test 21 was designed—by the
Civil Service Commission as a test of verbal .ability.
Q

You question that it does establish verbal

ability?
MR. EVANS;

I do not know one way or the other

because this record does Anofc clearly answer it.

The studies

that were conducted as to the validity of the test did not go

33

to whether or not it adequately measures verbal ability as a
trait.

What it went to i^as the question whether on the

hypothesis it measured verbal ability--and there is some
evidence that it does but not d&finitive—on the
hypothesis that it measured verbal ability, whether scores
on that test were reasonably predictive of scores on the
recruit school examinations.
Q

Assume they were not for a moment.

just like to think the thing through a little bit.

I would
Assume

that there is an expert who testifies without contradiction
that this test does establish verbal ability.

What would

your position be with regard to the question of whether that
is a job-related characteristic of the test of a policeman?
MR. EVANS:

That would require a professional---a

different kind of professional—
Q

It would take a professional to tell us

whether or not reading ability is a component of successful
performance as a policeman?
MR. EVANS:

It could be, 'or successful performance

of the training school.
Q

Suppose we put the training school completely

to one side--I think the Court of Appeals' problem is we focused
on the training school instead of the ultimate job.

Do you

take issue with the suggestion in Judge Robb's dissent that
one should know that a police officer must know hew to read

34
with sufficient skill to handle search warrants and things
like that.
MR. EVANS:

It is fine as a general proposition,

but professionals in the field have been quick to warn lay
persons in making the kinds of judgments that I think Judge
Robb mad®; which is beisically a lay judgment resting perhaps
on an accurate notion and perhaps not.
Q

I am not trying to debate the issue.

Your

position is that there must be proof in the record that,
reading ability has some relationship to the job of a police
officer before a court could accept that conclusion?
MR. EVANS:

1 think that is correct.

But I want to

emphasise that this case does not hinge on such a showing.
There is not adequate evidence as to that in this record, but
that is not what was shouldered by the defendants in this
case.

They were not trying to demonstrate that (a) the

police officers had to have verbal ability and (b) that, this
fcsefc is an adequate measure of verbal ability.

They were

hypothesising that verbal ability would likely be something
needed to succeed in a, training school.

Then they were finding

out whether, on the basis of that hypothesis;, scores on the
entry test were reasonably predictive; of scores in training
so that one could say, as I believe the evidence demonstrates,
that the higher one’s scores on the entry test, the more
likely ha is to achieve satisfactory scores on the recruit

35

school test:.

That is called a criterion-related validity

study under the technical jargon, and it is quite different
in concept and in form from what we are talking about, a
verbal ability test which would be studied under a construct
validity model, by which you determine what traits are needed
for the job and whether the particular test is a reasonable
measure of that trait.
Q

Would you agree that if a test established the

qualification'

for one of several traits that would b®

required for a job, it can nevertheless be job related?
MR* EVANS:
ambiguity.

Y@s.

The issue is not wholly free of

But I believe it is fair to say that if a test

was designed and used to measure the capacity of a particular
person—the ability of a particular applicant to do something,
a trait or what is called a construct, that if there was
proof that this test adequately measured—was an adequately
designed test to measure that trait, and if there was some
proof in the record, maybe or maybe not psychological but
probably psychologica in nature, to suggest that that trait
was an important part of the job, that would I think
establish job relatedness.
In our view, there are two things missing from the
record that makes it difficult to answer the question whether
this test is job related under the model of validation that
was used by the psycho3.ogisfc her®.

What is missing is that

36

it has been shown there is a correlation between the scores on
the entry test and scores on the recruit school examination.
What is not apparent from the record is whether and to what
extent there is any reasonable relationship between the
recruit school examinations and the recruit school curriculum.
That is , <3©

these examinations

or did these examinations

adequately measure mastery of the training school curriculum?
Mr. Sutton has pointed out that these examinations
as

they were used in 19S3 at least may not be available

anymore.

That is not. to say that some subsequent examinations

might not serve the purpose for this case.

But, in any event,

there ought to be an opportunity to explore this question
because without it, it is very difficult to determine whether
you are measuring a correlation

between the entry test and

some job performance measure or just entry test and some
abstraction.
And the second thing that is missing»”
Q

Is there not any presumption at all in

the

case of an employer that if he puts on a school and gives you
a test at the end of the school that the test is apt to be
based on what is taught in the school?
MR. EVANS:

I think that that is the kind of

presumption that the defendants were operating under at the
time of the trial in this case, and it may well have been
appropriate at the time.

And what has caused us to look at the

37
matter again is that standards have been in a state of
evolution since the time the trial

was conducted and, more

significantly, sines the ^im© the study was conducted, which
was before Griggs and before Title VIX was extended to the—■
Q

What has evolved with respect to that

particular point?
MR. EVANS:

I can give you a very specific example

on that point because the applicable professional standards,
which are ideals and not necessarily the minimum that must
be accomplished but the ideas to strive for.
Q

Where do these come from?

MR. EVANS:

These are published by the American

Psychological Association.
Q

What legal status do they have?
5

MR. EVANS:

For one thing,, they are referred and in

effect incorporated by reference by the EEOC guidelines.

I

mean, they are generally looked to as the source for what the
governing professional standards are to determine whether a
validity study is an adequate one to show what it is intended
to show.

And these standards have changed quite significantly

since 1966, which was the prior version cited by the Court in
Albemarle.

And on that particular point, there was nothing

iri the 1966 standards relating to whether or not the criterion
measure-—that

is, the training school exams—were related

significantly to the criterion, namely, training success.

It this document it becomes apparent that the professional
consensus now is that that is a relevant inquiry in
determining job relatedness, and this evolution has been-™
Q

What is to prevent the psychologists from

changing their mind tomorrow as they have been known to do?
MR. EVANS:

There is nothing to prevent it.

Indeed,

written these standards to be used as law, that there is a
growing profession.

Indeed, it is in its infancy.

may be changes of mind.
is as a guide really

And there

The only point of relying upon them

just as the agencies themselves

formulate guidelines which themselves change.
Q

Mr. Evans, I am somewhat puzzled by your posi­

tion.

Let me see if I can clarify at least my understanding

of it.

Is it the position of the United Statas Department

of Justice in this case or generally that verbal ability is
not a key imperative for the function of a policeman,
particularly on a metropolitan police force, whan he must
understand--as the arguments just last week before this Court,
in two cases were made

that ha must understand the Boyd

case, that he must understand the Weeks case, he must
understand Miranda, he must understand Terry and the nuances
of all of those cases--is it the position of the Department
of Justice that you need a psychologist to tell you whether
verbal skills are related to that process?

39

MR. EVANS:

I think one can hypothesize fairly

that that is a substantial part of a police officer*s job.
Q

Hypothesise?

MR. EVANS:
are making.

It is, after all, an assumption that we

It is not something that w® know.

We have not,

I assume, studied—
Q
must he not?

He must make out applications for warrants,
And then it was argued to us only last week that

if the judge in issuing the warrant makes a mistake, that he
ought to be skillful enough to recognize that the» judge has
!

made a mistake in issuing the warrant and not execute the
warrant.
MR. EVANS:

Let me aasuma for a moment that it is

an important and substantial part of a police officer’s job.
The study that was presented in this case to support the job
relatedness of Test 21 was not designed to show the extent
to which Test 21 measured verbal ability.

That was not the

model by which the validation was undertaken.

It was under­

taken under this other model which I have mentioned, the
criterion related validity.
There is some statement in the expert affidavits
in the case

that Test 21 does measure verbal ability and

that verbal ability is needed to pass the training school.
But that is not what was attempted to be shouldered by the
professional validation studies submitted to this Court, and

40

I do not think it is fair to infer from the evidence before
the Court that the test has been shown job related by a
professionally acceptable method as to the verbal ability
aspect of it.
Q

mr. Evans, you said there were two things

missing from the petitioners3 case, that you stated the
second-MR. EVANSs

I do not think I did.

The second is

that, assuming for a moment that there is a basis for
relating the recruit school examination scores to the content
of the training program, that one measures the other, there
is not adequate evidence in the record, in our view, to
relata the recruit school curriculum to the job of a police
officer*.

Again, I think non-professionals can find it easy

to make assumptions by looking at the curriculum itself and
then assuming

what we all know a little bit about to be a

police officer’s job.

But the fact of the matter is that

there ought to be something in the evidence showing what it is
police officer's do once they get out, of training school in
order to justify the use of this training school as the
measure of the criterion for justifying the entry test.
Q

Would that have to be shown by the testimony

of a professional psychologist?
MR. EVANS:
Rehnquist.

I do not think so, Mr. Justice

1 think it may in certain cases.

But I think there

41
is no reason to establish that as an automatic rule.

I think

in a case like this, for example, it may b© perfectly adequate
to have police officers in a supervisory capacity come in and
testify--but it is a question of fact--testify as to what
a police officer does and then compare that
curriculum.

with the

In soma cases it is going to bf* necessary to have

what the psychologists call a job analysis in a more technical
field perhaps to decide what it is that the person is really
doing on the job.

But whether it is required in this case or

not, it seems to me, is itself a question that ought to be
resolved by the district court.
Q

Mr. Evans, have you read the questions in Test

21 in the record?
MR. EVANS ;
Q

I have read many of them.

Do you regard them as very difficult?

Could

you answer 50 percent, of them?
MR. EVANS;
Q

Yes.

MR. EVANS;
Blackmun.

Could I?

I did not take the test, Mr. Justice

I hope I could.

They are not all that difficult.

They are designed to be high school lesvel.

They are designed

to measure what a high school graduate is likely to be able
to answer.
Q

Seme of those questions, I do not see how you

could even mark them.

42
MR, EVANS:
are

What I was about to say, some of them

not so easy to understand or the answer is not altogether

clear.
Q

Question eight, for example, on page 24(a).

Q

Perhaps that is why the passing mark is quite

low.
MR. EVANS:

Let me state again, although 1 hesitate

to admonish the Court or suggest to the Court again that
psychologists would frown on what we are doing hare.

This is

called, in the psychological jargon, a study of face validity.
That is, you look at the test and you decide on the basis of
looking at it whether it measures something important or
whether it is a good test for the purpose in which it is used.
Everybody in the profession

at least—and I think

everybody in this cas€i---sgree3 that that is not an appropriate
inquiry, that the ippropriate inquiry is a professional one.
And indeed I think this Court's decision in Albemarle makes
clear that job relatedness depends on a showing based on
professionally acceptable methods and face validity? that is,
looking at the face of the tost is not such © method,
Q

Mr. Evans, could I ask you one other question.

You are here as attorney for the Civil Service Commission, as
I understand.
MR. EVANS:
Q

That is right.

And you are identifying some shortcomings in

43
the defendant's proof.,

Are you in effect asking for a remand

so that your client can put in the evidence that you say is
missing?

Are you in effect representing that that evidence

is available?
MR. EVANS:

No.

As we say in the brief, Mr. Justice

Stevens, it is not altogether clear whether the evidence is
available or has been retained or can be reconstructed.
Mr. Sutton has said today that the tears that were used as a
basis—
Q

You are here on behalf of a litigant.

And on

behalf of that litigant you want it remanded?
MR. EVANS:

I think the case ought to be remanded

and an inquiry should be made as to whether there is evidence
that can be presented on these issues.
Q

You have not made that inquiry yet, I take it.

MR. EVANS:
Q

Pardon me?

You have not made that inquiry yet?

MR. EVANS:

In part the inquiry depends on what the

District has available.
Q

But my—

You are sort of arguing in the abstract hare.

MR. EVANS:
Q

If there is not—

I am sorry?

You are sort of arguing in the abstract here.

MR. EVANS:

I think--as 1 was going to say, I think

the inquiry should be made as to whether the evidence exists.
If it does not exist, I think there is a further inquiry to

44
foe made whether the plaintiffs in this case or the plaintiffs’
failure to specifically raise these particular weaknesses
that we have identified at any time in the district court
contributed to the non-existence of the evidence at this
point and if so—
Q

They also moved for a summary judgment, did

they not?
MR. EVANS:

They did.

There are times X think even when both parties
believe summary judgment is appropriate that it turns out not
t© be appropriate.
Q

Has anyone but you raised this issue here

previously, what you are now arguing?
MR. EVANS:
Q

These particular weaknesses?

Yes.

MR. EVANS:

Aside from the Court of Appeals in some

respects, no.
Q

So, you have raised weaknesses in your own

c&se-MR. EVANS:
Q

That is correct.

—and suggest that someone else should remedy

them.
MR. EVANS:

It is weaknesses in the joint case put

on by the defendants in the district court in light of what we
think are the current standards, and another inquiry in the

45
district court might quit® properly be whether, even if the
evidence today or the evidence in the district court turns out
not to be sufficient under the standards we have articulated
as what we think to be the current standards, whether it
might have been satisfactory under the standards that existed
then.

As I have said,, there is reason to believe that

standards have evolved substantially.
Q

From where you now stand, how do you answer

Mr. Sutton's story about your not doing anything about saving
judicial time?

You da not even know what you want.

MR. EVANS:

I think I have articulated that we

are not clear what evidence is available, but there are
matters for inquiry, I think,

appropriately in the district

court even if there is no evidence available, and that is,
Where does the brunt of that failure fall at this point?
It seems to me ‘the problem is this—

How can the brunt fall on the petitioners?

The proof doss not meet them.

Let us look at the

The other alternative is to say, "The plaintiffs

Therefore,

Summary judgment in favor of the defendants."

I am suggesting an alternative which would send it
back to the district court.
Q

Could we not, on the basis of your argument,

say that the plaintiff did not need his burden of proof?
MR. EVANSi
Q

Yes.

MR. EVANS:

The plaintiff?
Could we not from what you are now saying?
I think that the plaintiffs met their

threshold burden of establishing adverse racial impact.
Arguably the defendants met their burden of proving job
relatedness by submitting what we think now is partial
evidence and with a general statement, by its experts that
this met applicable standards and proved job relatedness.

In

the absence then of a specific attack by the plaintiffs on
the weaknesses that we now feel we are vulnerable on, perhaps
they should bear the burden at having failed to raise the

47
weaknesses that w© now perceive in the evidence that we
presented.
Q

How can the petitioners be required to produce

You are conceding that

you lost that part of the case?
MR. EVANS:
Q

That is right.

And you do here represent the Civil Service

Commission and only the Civil Service Commission today?
MR. EVANS:

That, is right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Evans.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD, B. SOBOL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS DAVIS, ET AL.
MR. SOBOLs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may ifc please

the Court:
I would like to start

with Justice Powell's inquiry

concerning the basis of the suit, and to clarify one or two mis­
conceptions that have crept in.
Thera wera three bases for this action, as alleged in
the complaint which appears on page 24 of the printed
Appendix.

The action was based on the Fifth Amendment to the

United States Constitution and the Equal Protection
requirements implicit therein.

It was based on Section 19 81

of Title 42 which, as far as I understand it, is not a pro­
cedural statute but is a substantive statute creating a private
right of action against racial discrimination and employment.
It is unlike 1983 in that regard as the opinions of this Court
in, for example, D.C. v. Carter make clear.
And, third, it was based on the District of Columbia
Code 1-320 which prohibits racial discrimination
in the District of Columbia.

in employment

And there was jurisdiction

alleged for each of these bases of action.
So, in essence, the x^ay the case reaches the Court,
this Court, the issue is not the bald issue of whether Title

49

VII standards are the same as constitutional standards.

It

is whether the composite of -Section 1981 of Title 42, the
prohibition against racial discrimination in employment in
the D.C. Code and the Fifth Amendment together represent a
lower standard than the Title VII standard, and I would
submit that is not the case, that the courts have treated
1981 as equivalent, at the least, to Title VII in its
prohibition against racial discrimination in employment.
But moving to the constitutional issue, I would say
this, that the test creates a classification between those who
pass it and those who do not.

At the very minimum, the

issue is whether there, is a rational basis for that
classification, and we take the position that there is no
difference between the question of whether a classification
is rational and whether a test is related to a job.
essentially the same question.

We do not need in this case

to get into the details of the EEOC guidelines.
ail issue.

It is

That is not

We simply say there is a requirement under any of

these bases of authority that the defendants make a showing
at least ©f rationality. Rationality for the use of an
employment

test would mean that the test has some relationship

to the job in some respect, and it is our position that that
showing has not been made her©.
Q

Mr. Sobol, your prayer in the district court

was basically for declaratory judgment, was it not?

50

MR. SOBOL:

No, air, for declaratory

judgment

and injunction and back pay.
0

Certainly so far as declaratory judgment and

Injunction are concerned, that has never been issued by the
district court in your favor, at any rate, since 1972 Title
VII has applied.
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Yes, sir.

Any declaratory judgment that you would now

gat or injunctive relief that you would now get would have to
be based on Title VII, would it not?
MR. SOBOL:

Not necessarily.,

There is a problem of

simply amending to allege a Title VII action because you
cannot be in court under Title VII unless you exhaust your
administrative remedies and get the appropriate action by the
administrative tribunal.

So, it is not a simple matter of

moving in the district court to amend it.

At least it is a

question whether that is possible; and whether this case
could ever be turned into a strictly speaking Title VII case I
think is questionable.
Q

But what useful purpose or indeed what case or

controversy would the district court be deciding if it were
now

to enter a declaratory judgment or an injunction one way

or the other in this case, based on the law that governed in
the District of Columbia before 1972?
MR. SOBOL:

This law still governs.

It is a question

51
of another piece of law also governs.

The plaintiffs brought

this action before Title VII applied to the District.
alleged three grounds of substantive right.

It

Those grounds

are all still fully applicable, and they rely on them.
Q

One of them is the constitutional ground.

MR. SOBOL:

One of them is the constitutional

ground.
Q

What do you think the Court of Appeals used

as its basis for decision?
MR. SOBOL:

The Court of Appeals cited in its

opinion th© constitutional ground and 1981.
Q

And it decided on both grounds, do you not

think?
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, sir.

I think it mad® no distinc­

tion in the substantive standards, Mr. Justice White, and I
think it decided on the grounds that were before it.

Yes,

sir.
Q

Mr. Sobol, I understand you to say that you

think feh© rational basis test is the appropriate one and
that there must therefore be a rational relationship between
the test and the job.

Who has th® burden of

showing that

in this cas®?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

The defendants.

why?

MR. SOBOL:

Because the burden of showing

52

rationality—your question assumes strictly a constitutional
standard„ I assume.
G

I thought you just said you did not think this

was a Title VII case.
MR. SOBOL;

It is not a Title VII case, but it is

based on two statutes prohibiting the discrimination in
employment in this circumstance and the Constitution.
Q

Do

you think the standard under 1981 is

different from the constitutional standard?
MR. SOBOL;

No, sir, I personally do not.

But I

think that under any of those standards, having shown the
adverse impact, th® burden of defending the practice, as in
any constitutional case, is on th© defendant, of making some
showing of whatever the applicable standard is, rationality,
compelling interest.

The burden is cm the defendant in making

that showing, yes, sir.
Q

If it were agreed that this is nothing but a

straight Equal Protection constitutional issue, I understand
you are saying that if the plaintiff proved a statistical
adverse impact, the burden then shifts to the defendant.
MR. SOBOL;
Q

Yes, sir.

Is there any authority for that?

MR. SOBOL;

Yes, sir, there is in the nature--there

is no authority in the employment context in this Court, but
in footnote 35 of our brief on page 27 I have cited about 15

53

cases of the Courts of Appeal and the district courts that
have directly faced this very question you are asking and
have concluded that the standards are the same.
Q

That the constitutional standard and the Title

VII standard are the same?
MR. SOBOL:
appear in footnote 35.
Q

Are the same, yes, sir, and these

cases

I have about 15 different authorities.

I knew there were cases in the circuit courts,

but is there any decision of this Court that supports your
view as to the shifting of the burden of proof in an Equal
Protection case merely on the basis of statistical evidence?
MR. SOBOL:
context.

Certainly not in the employment

My understanding of Jefferson v. Hackney, however,

was that the Court ruled that there was no necessity to make
a showing of compelling interest, but there was an inquiry,
based on the statistic, into rationality, and I have always
assumed that the burden of establishing rationality for a
classification falls on the defendants.
Q

Is not any act presumed constitutional and the

burden of showing it is unconstitutional falls on him who
would, attack it.

So, is not the proper phrasing of the

Equal Protection test that the plaintiff who was challenging the
governmental action on Equal Protection has to show that there
is no rational connection rather than—it is a legal really, not
a factual™-

54

MR. SOBOL:
cases,

That is not my understanding of the

I anight be wrong in that regard.

It is ray understanding

that the burden of showing rationality, once the classification
was established, is on the defendant,
Q

Of course there is a classification in every

case.
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, sir.

But here, to wind up this

discussion, whatever may be the correct answer under tire
constitutional standard, for the Court to make a distinction
in this case between Titio VII standards and the standards
applicable here, it would have to rule that the direct
prohibition against racial discrimination and employment in
two federal statutes, 1981 and the provision of the D.C. Code
that I cited, establish a different standard of racial
discrimination in employment than Title VII, and I suggest
there is no authority for that.

The decisions applying 1981

have made no distinction between its substantive thrust and
t±i© substantive thrust of Title VII.
Q

We must face the fact that the Court of Appeals

did go on constitutional grounds,
MR. SOBOL:

I think that you must face the fact that

the Court of Appeals relied on both sources of law and made
no distinction between them.
Q

Is it your impression of the Equal Protection

standard that a showing of unequal racial impact is a violation

55
of equal protection of the law?
MR. SOBOL;

1 think a practice that has an uneven

racial impact has to be, at the very minimum, rational,
although there are certainly cases in this Court saying that
it has to be more than rational.

But without getting into

that because we do not need to get into that, I think at the
very minimum there has to be rationality to support adverse
racial impact under constitutional standards.
Q

Is that enough under Title VII?

MR. SOBOL;

Yes, I think so.

I think what the

Court-Q

Just to show some rational explanation is

enough under Title VII?
MR. SOBOL;

I think what is rational for a test is

that the test is related to the job.
Q

That is different.

MR.. SOBOL;
my opinion.

Wo, I do not think it is different, in

The rational basis for the use of an employment

test is that the employment test assists the: employer in
choosing employees in some positive way.
Griggs held.

That is what 1 think

That is what I think the essence of the guide™
\

linos are.
Q

Mr. Sobol, I wonder if perhaps we are not

phrasing the constitutions’! issue incorrectly.

You suggest

that the classification is between those who pass and those

56
who fail.

X' wonder if you are not really arguing that if one

looks closely behind what has happened, that wa really have
a racial classification, and that is your contentions

That

the way the test works, it divides the group on account of
race rather than simply on account of pass/fail.

If that is

the question, then our issue is whether it is a racial
classification which in turn would decide what kind of
burden was involved.

I am just wondering if you have not

spoken just, a little hastily.
MR. SOBOL:

I think it can be looked at in terms

of either a racial classification or a non-racial classifi­
cation.

It definitely has racial impact.

racial classification„

It may not be a

But whether it is or it is not,

rationality must be shown, and we do not think we need more
than rationality to prevail.
0

X am just wondering if the question of whether

or not it is a racial classification turns on whether or not
the test has an independent neutral justification, namely,
the job relatedness.

In other words, the job relatedness

issue may determine how we decide the classification
question.
MR. SOBOL:

The opinions of this Court do not

indicate, as I read them, that—and X am thinking of the
California housing case, the name has slipped my mind—do
not indicate that a practice having racial impact

is a

racial classification»
to the contrary.

The indications# as I read them# are

Mindful of that# we have not argued and

have never argued that there is a racial classification in
this case which demands strict scrutiny or a compelling
interest.

We are content to rely on the necessity that there

be a rational basis for the use of a test, and I think the
only rational basis for the use of a test is that it does the
employer some good and that that needs to be proved# and it
has not been proved here.
Q

Then let me just ask you the one last

question, and I will be through.

I have asked the others

this question# and I would like to be sure that you have
addressed it before you sit down.

On the question of job

relatedness, do you contend that this is not a measure of
verbal ability or that verbal ability is not an aspect of the
job or neither?
MR. SOBOL:

Verbal ability is an aspect of this and

almost any other job in the world.

I do not

■think tliat is how these cases can be decided any more than
Griggs could fos decided on that basis.
Q

There is clearly a greater correlation between

verbal ability for a policeman's job and the jobs involved in

58
Griggs, 1 think.

Would you not agree with 'that?

I think the

assumption there was a total absence of correlation between
the particular tests and the particular jobs at stake.
MR. SOBOL:

Every Title Vis case I have tried, Your

Honor, the defendants have brought in experts and have
attempted to prove that the jobs are complicated, require the
filling out of complicated forms, require the use of compli­
cated machinery, for which there are printed manuals that
must be understood.

I have never seen a ca.se in which any

defendant has ever said that the jobs in question were not
complicated and did not require reading and writing of
complex material.
Q

And it is true here too.

When you read the cassia, Mr. Sobol, as I sug­

gested to your friend, the Solicitor General, from Boyd and
Weeks down to the most recant, do you suggest that verbal
skills are not highly important?
MR. SOBOL:

Not for one second.

What I suggest is

that Test 21 has not been shown to be a reliable indicator
of whether those verbal skills in the necessary degree are
present or not present.

And what this Court held in Griggs

is that cannot b© surmised but it has; to be proved.

And that

is our position here, that there is & method of proving
job ralatedness with which we have no argument, called
construct, validation, which involves taking a trait such as
verbal ability and doing the appropriate job analysis and the

59
appropriate study «and rendering a report * and fch© Civil
Service Commission regulations accept that and the EEOC
regulations accept that, but that has not been done here*
Q

Then are we to take it that you are in general

agreement with Mr. Sutton’s position that verbal skills are
crucial to police function?
MR. SOBOL:

I think a policeman has to be able to

understand written material, speak, make reports
and make applications for search warrants.
very important part of the job.

to court

I think it is a

I have no question about that.

What we do question is whether there is any indication that
beyond the existing and unchallenged requirement in this
case of a high school education that this test measures
something that will assist the display of those skills.
is what we see as the question.

That

We do not dispute for one

moment that the requirements to be a policeman are demanding
and rigorous and that, they should be fulfilled.

We do not for

one moment think that the application of the Griggs test in
any context involves a lowering of standards.
what Griggs and Moody were about.

That is not

There is no effort by this

Court to give out jobs to those who are not qualified for them.
What the Court has held is that where there is ai substantial
adverse impact, we are not going to guess as to whether the
standard is valid or not valid, but that it raises a require­
ment to prove that it is valid.

If it is valid, if it

60

measures something important, it can be used.
not, it cannot be used.

And if it is

And I think that there is an

underlying current in the briefs in this case ‘that there is
something about the Griggs test which requires putting
incompetents in jobs, and 1 think that is the furthest thing
from the truth that can possibly be.

It is simply a demand

that some proof be set forth as to whether the standard
applied--here Test 21--is predictive of the ability to
perform those verbal skills or not.
Q

Let us assume that there was evidence, expert

evidence, and the experts said, "This measures it to some
extent, but there is a much better test."

And they put in

the record what they think would be a much better test*

But

they say, "Obviously any kind of test like this measures
verbal skills to some extent, and it measures verbal skills
to some extent in connection with a job.

This test is job

related to an extent, but'there is a much better one."

What

do you think then the result should be?
MR. SOBOL:

If there was proof that there was a much

better one, that would raise the question of whether it was a
less discriminatory alternative as called for by this Court's —
Q

I know, but that is not required in just

ordinary rational basis equal protection cases, is it?
MR. SOBOL:

No, that is true, but I do think it is

required under 1981, which I view and I think has viewed—

i

/

61
Q

It is required under 1981, you think?

MR. SOBOL:

—*as comparable to Title VII, that there

be no less discriminatory alternative.

But in this case

the defendants made no effort to base their case on proof of
verbal ability being required for a policeman8s job.

The

contention—
Q

But you do challenge apparently Judge Gesell's

ability or our ability or the Court of Appeals' ability to
say that this test obviously measures verbal skills to some
extent and to some extent it is job related.,

You think we

have to have some expert?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Yes.

What kind of expert?

MR. SOBOL:

An expert who is competent to do a

validation study of one of the three types that have been
recognised by the authorities in the field.
%

Q

What about just an ordinary policeman, a police

officer—say he has been in an administrative position for 20
years—you would not accept him?

Just an experienced police

officer.
MR. SOBOL:

On what issue?

On whether this test

predicts the right measure of verbal ability?

No, I would not

accept him, and the proof of that is that they are using a
cutoff score of 40, which is completely arbitrary.

There is

no pi’oof that it, rather than 50 or 30 or 35 or 60,is the

62

appropriate cutoff»
Q

It was chosen at random.

That does not goto the question of whether it

measures the skill.

That goes to the question of how much of

the skill you want.
MR. SOBOL:
Q

How much of the skill is being measured.

Those are two different inquiries.

MR. SOBOLs:

Yes, it is two different inquiries, but

it goes to whether the test is being validly used.

If the

test being used were the law boards, which also measures
verbal ability, and the same passing requirement was imposed,
we would say, "Yes, it is measuring verbal cjbilifcy but much
too much verbal ability."

And the question is, In view of the

adverse racial impact, is that justified?

Is it justified to

have this additional unnecessary requirement?
The point here is that verbal ability is required,
but we do not know
indicates enough.

how much is required and where Test 21
Perhaps answering a quarter of the

questions on Test 21 would indicate sufficient ability.
Q

How does that fit into your rationality analysis,

assuming that you concede that verbal skills are necessary to
perform a policeman's job and assuming it is established to
your satisfaction that this test measures verbal skills to
some extent along the lines of Justice White's question,
what more, in your view, do you need to haves to establish
rationality from an equal protection analysis?

63

MR. SOBOL:

I think what more you need is a

showing that the way the test is being used with the cutoff
is having some measurable impact on the skills needed by a
policeman.

Let me answer your question further.
>

Q

Can we evaluate the test by who passes it and

who fails; is that it?
MR. SOBOL:

I think the first question is whether it

has racial .impact, or we would not be here.

But going beyond

that, it seems to ms the question is, you have a high school
requirement to be on the police force.

As far as any of us

know, that is adequate verbal ability to fill out these
reports and to understand these cases.

The question is

whether Test 21 adds anything to that that is valid.
Q

Test 21 obviously adds something since many

high school diplomates failed it.
MR. SOBOL:

That is true, but we do not know

whether it is screening out people that cannot perform or not.
We have no evidence of whether the people it is screenisg out
could or could not perform adequately well as policemen.
Q

You mentioned high school graduates.

I wanted

to ask anyway whether the record in this case shows any
correiafcionbetwaen the performance on a test and the prior
performance in high school.

Are the high school grades

available, for example?
MR. SOBOL:

No, sir, they are not in the record.

64

Q

What about correlation between performance

on the test and attendance at particular high schools?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

There is nothing on that in the record.

There may very well be a difference between

the training one receives say at Central High School in
Washington and that that one might receive in Wise County,
Virginia up in the moxintains.
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, that is true, and we do not

question that the department has a right to give a test if it
can make a showing that the test is .improving its selection
processes.

But what is failing here is under any of the

alternative methods of making that showing that have been
recognized, any proof of that.

And 1 suggest that the questions

t

that are being asked are essentially raising the question of
whether we just simply cannot read the

test, whether the

Court cannot simply just, read the test and say yes, it measures
verbal ability.

But if they administered the crossword puzzle

in the Washington Post each morning to the applicants for
work on the police force, that would measure verbal ability
unquestionably.

And yet would that be a valid test?

the answer has to be the same.

I think

It is not simply looking at a

test and saying this is verbal, this is not verbal.

The

important part of Griggs and Moody and the whole development
of the law in this area is some proof, not surmise, that that
is true, that you have a proper measure of validation, you

65
have a proper measure that this device is assisting the
employer in getting bcstter policemen, better employees,
whatever the case may be.
Q

What should we do if we decided that the

Court of Appeals was wrong on its constitutional ground?
MR. SOBOL:

I think the Court is faced with the

decision of whether the Court of Appeals was wrong on all of
the grounds on which its decision was based.
Q

Let us assume that we decided it was wrong on

1981.
MR. SOBOL:
Q

And what?

On the constitutional ground because Title VII—

do you think the Court of Appeals considered Title VII?
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, it did consider Title VII.

The

Court of Appeals cited some cases saying that where there is
a change in federal statutorial law curing the course of
litigation, that change should be applied to pending
litigation.
Q

And that is cited in the court’s opinion.
But on that basis, why would it ever have

reached the constitutional ground?

Why would it not have just

dealt with the statutory ground?
MR. SOBOL:

I do not believe the court's opinion can

be read as specifying which of these grounds it is relying on.
Q

You were going to refer to court's opinion?

MR. SOBOL:

Yes.

It is the end of footnote 2 on page

66
2-A.
Q
Title VII.

What it says: "Congress has since amended
It reached charges of racial discrimination in

Federal employment, and appellants unquestionably are
entitled to the benefit of that amendment."
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, sir.

And I think that in view of

that, what Judge Robinson was doing was saying that Title
VII is applicable as vrell as the other basis of authority.
Q

But you just told me that he also decided

on the constitutional ground.
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, I said that, and what I meant is

that in his opinion hcs recited that the complaint was based on
the constitutional ground, on 1981, and then he made this
additional statement v/hich Justice Brennan just read, holding
that the Title VII standards were applicable to this case.
Q

Do you think this is just a purely Title VII

case as it comes to us from the Court of Appeals without any
constitutional overtones?
MR. SOBOL:

My trouble honestly with that proposi­

tion is the procedural requirements to get into court under
Title VII, and this case has not met them.

And so it raises

the question, in order to make a determination as to whether
this statement of Judge Robinson's is correct, it requires
this Court to make a determination, given the circumstances
of pending litigation--and in fact in this case there were

67

prior administrative procaedings--v/hether the Court would
dispense in this context with the exhaustion requirements of
Title VII and consider this a Title VII case as I think it
surely would be if there were no exhaustion requirements
under Title VII.

I think then the authority cited by Judge

Robinson would be squarely on point.

The only wrinkle is that

there was no charge, there was no final agency action, and
there was no resort to court-Q

And it might be that with respect to the

amendment, taking Title VII to apply to federal employees,
that there may be no right to a trial de novo in a district
court.

That is a matter we are going to consider later this

week.
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Yes, sir.

So that the scope of the trial might arguably

have been wrong.
MR. SOBOL:

I believe that issue concerns federal

employees and not District of Columbia employees.
Q

Perhaps that is correct.

Yes, I was thinking

of federal courts.
MR. SOBOL:
Q

And that issue would not be involved.

Mr. Sobol, the 0„C. Code, the third basis for

your relief, which is not mentioned by Judge Robinson, is
that akin to 19Si or akin to Title VII in your case, if there
is a difference between the two?

68

MR. SOBOL:

You would have to tell me what you

perceive to be the difference because T cannot see one.

It

is a prohibition against discrimination in District of
Columbia government employment.
says.

That is what the statute

Neither 1981 nor Title VII is limited to government

employment, but the standard-no racial discrimination in
employment*—seems to me to be identical in 19 81 and Title
VII.

And Judge Robinson, it seems to me, both made this

comment about Title VII being applicable and treated the
standards as the same, as has every lower court that has
reached this question.
Q

Some of the justices were assuming there might

be a difference between the constitutional standard and the
Title VII standard»

I was just asking, if you assumed

arguendo that there was such a difference, in which category
would you put the D.C. Code?
MR, SOBOL:

In the statutory standsxd because it

is a statute which specifically addresses this problem, as
does Title VII, and I would be hard put to think of any basis
for distinguishing the D.C. Code provision and 1981.
Q

So, your view would be, whether we find a

difference or not, we still have to face a Title VII type
case because of the D.C. Code.
MR. SOBOL:

Yes.

Yes, exactly.

I would like to briefly point out some other issues

69

that have been mad®.

On the adverse impact, very briefly,

we think this is one of the clearest showings of adverse
impact of any case that has been litigated.

So, there is no

The impact of the test is fully

reflected in the hiring decision.
Q

Your hiring figures, however, go to those who

appiy? not to those who pass.
MR. SOBOL:

Exactly, because the issue is the

legality of the test.
Q

And it is just the reverse when you narrow the

pool to those who pass.
MR. SOBOL:

I can hardly say it would be just the

The black rate of hire is

The white rate of hire is 37.9 percent.

It

is extremely close and fully explained by the national
recruitment effort

where in 1970 and 1971 the department

went all over the country, got applications from an 88 percent
white group, and naturally most of those who applied did not

70

corae to work in the District because it was far from their
home*

Although there is this very slight difference, I think

it is essentially equivalent, and what it shows is that the
discriminatory practice here is what is being challenged,
and that is Test 21.
Q

Mr. Sobol, what is the chronology of the

processing or what was, at the time of this trial, the
chronology from the time of application to the time of be­
coming

a probationary policeman?

On the application, for

example, do the statistics here include applicants who are not
in fact high school graduates who said no to the question on
the form, Did you graduate from high school?
MR. SOBOL:

My understanding, Mr. Justice Stewart,

is that an applicant is asked if he graduated high school;
and if he says no, he is not given an application.
Q

Then it is not even an application.

MR. SOBOL:

It is not an application.

These

figures in the record are for high school graduates who
completed an application satisfying the high school educa­
ti on requiremenfc.
Q

And presumably the other requirements, i.e.,

What is your age?

Fifty-two.

MR. SOBOL:

Would not be accepted and would not be

administered.
Q

What that be an application?

What is your age?

71
Sixteen.

Would that be an application?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

I do not believe so.

But do you know?

It seems to me quite

important.
MR. SOBOL: It is not in the record.

I know from

extra record material that the answers I am giving are
correct.

But there is nothing in the record specifically on

the question you are asking.
Q

So, these applications, included in these

statistics in the record, are all applications from people
who are prima facie qualified applicants“-high school
graduates between 20 and 29?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Yes, sir, that is my understanding,

Who have whatever the other requirements are—

no serious criminal record or whatever.
MR. SOBOL:
physical examination.

But not the mental examination and not the
My understanding of the chronology is

Only test passers are

given a physical examination and a mental psychiatric
examination.
Q

So, to return to my original question--! am

sorry I did not let you answer it-—what is the chronology?
An application-MR. SOBOL:

An applicant walks in, indicates

whether or not he meets these minimal age and education

72
requirements and is on the spot that day administered a test
which is scored then.
Q

But he is not even given an application form

unless his oral response to the inquiry indicates that he is
prima facia eligible; is that correct?
MS. SOBOL:
Q

Yes,, sir.

That is my understanding.

So then he fills out the application, giving

his name, address, age, high school graduate, blah, blah.
Then what happens?
MR. SOBOL:

He is administered the test right then

and there.
Q

Then and there?

MR. SOBOL:

Yes, sir, and it is scored right then

and there.
Q

Right there at the counter?

MR. SOBOL:

By the examiner, by the police officer

in charge of this function.

And it is scored right then and

there.
Q

He is individually given the test?

MR. SOBOL;

Yes.

Everything I am saying is not in

the record, but that is my understanding.
Q

I think it is important to understand the

statistics.
MR. SOBOL:
important.

Yes, I do not question that it is

It is just not in the record.

I want to make that

73
clear.
Q

And the statistics show that if he was a white

applicant—-of 100 white applicants, how many of them pass the
test?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

And 100 Negro applicants?

MR. SOBOL:
Q

Eighty-seven.

Forty-three.

And then all of the 87 and all of the 43 then

go to a training program?
MR. SOBOL:

No.

They then have a character

investigation and a psychiatric investigation.
Q

This comes post test?

MR. SOBOL:
Q

And a physical.

MR. SOBOL:
Q

Yes.

And a physical.

Post. test.

show about that?

And now what do the statistics

We now have 87 white applicants and 43, is

it?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Forty-three, yes.

Negro applicants.

Then what happens to this

group of 87 and 43 between the time of passing the test and
taking the training program?
MR. SOBOL:

They have these three requirements to

meet—the physical, character, and mental.
If they pass—* at least at the time this record was

74
compiled--they were offered a job.
Q

How many would be left of ‘the 87?

MR. SOBOL:

At the point the job was offered,

Mr. Justice Stewart, there are no figures in the record.
What we have is acceptances of offers.

In other words, those

who were hired and went to training school.

And the

figures

I gave Mr. Justice Blackmun are 39 percent of the blacks and
37 percent of the whites—I am rounding it off—were hired,
and I am talking about those who pass now.
Q

Of those who passed.

MR. SOBOL:
0

Yes.

So, that means 37 percent of the whites, 38 or

39 percent of the Negroes presumably then passed the
physical and th© character and the mental.
mental?

What is the

Is that something additional to these?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Yes.

You see a psychiatrist and—

It is psychological, not mental, not

intellectual.
MR. SOBOL:
Q

No, no, it is psychological.

Right.

MR. SOBOL:

Psychological.

Q

And then 37 percent would be something

like 35 people out of the 87 and some 18 people out of the
43.
MR. SOBOL:

Right.

And the exact figures, out of

75
ever 100 whites that applied, 33 were hired; and out of every
hundred blacks that applied, 17 were hired.
Q

Thank you very much.

Q

Is your next case the bar examination?

MR. SOBOL:

I do not have that case.

I know that

case is coming.
Q

And whatever is decided here certainly will

bear on that one.
MR. SOBOL:
case is written.

It depends on how the opinion in this

If the opinion is written that there are

statutory bases for the claim here, therefore there is no
occasion to reach the constitutional question, then it will
not bear on that case.

And it would seem to me that is the

most appropriate basis of deciding this case, given the
Court's rule about constitutional decisions.

There are

plainly statutory bases for the relief here with or without
the Title VII component, and I would think that would be the
basis on which the case was decided.
Q

And other statutes presumably would not apply

to a bar association case, would they?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

Because they would not involve employment.

MR. SOBOL:
Q

Oh, no, certainly.

Right.

Right.

Mr. Sobol, one of the problems here may be that

the passing grade is incorrectly set.

Does the record tell us

76
whether fchs passing grade is deterrairtad by th® Civil Service
Cotranlssion or by tha police department and whether it: is the
same or different fron the passing grade used when the test
is given for other types of jobs?
MR, SOBOL;

No,

The closest thing on the record on

the questions you are asking is that it has been this way for
25 years# and it is supposed to indicate a level of
proficiency equal to a high school education, a high school
graduation.

That is ...11 there is in the record in answer to

your question,

Q

Thank you.

MR. SOBOL:

I would like to very briefly get. to a

point that really has not been discussed, and that is the
issue of whether there has been a validation study here which
has indicated that Test 21 is validated against success in
•■.-.raining.

The Court .*•£ Appeals did not decide the question

of v;Iv::trnr training is an appropriate, criterion for the
v2 id at lor of a tersi., ani it. is vary clear from its opinion
it did not,

I stress that because there seems to be an

invitation tendered by the arnica©, if no ones else, for the

Court to decide broad questions of whether tests can be
validaued cguinst training.

The Court of Appeals found—-and

1 eci rring to iootuots 59 on page 3 6-A and 17-A—that there

was no showing that liwf 21 predicted success in-training,
holding

'

snr-o;

-

77
question of whether training is a proper criterion should
not be reached»

And, very briefly, the reason why the Court

of Appeals held I think correctly that there was no such
showing is that there

is no proof-—I will put it differently.

Success in training is successful completion of recruit
school.

That is the only measure of success in training

which has ever been used.

Every■recruit passed recruit

school.
The department essentially asked the court to
assume that persons who did not. achieve a score of 40 on Test
21 could not pass recruit school.

But if the cutoff score

wa& 45 or 50, the proof in this case would be identical and
the proof 1 refer to is there would be a correlation between
tl'isi level of passing score on Test 21 and the level of passing
score in recruit school.

And the same argument could then

be mo.de, that anyone who did not get a 50 could not pass
recruit school.

And of course we have a record here where

Ob eu oar da upc-i thousands got between 40 and 50 and went on to
recruit school and .v.iceooded.

There is

no difference

between the hyp vrhhatical f put and the facts here.

And the authorities we have indicated in our brief do indicate

excessive measure of the verbal ability needed to perform the

vie ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals

be affirmed.

W® think there is plenty of room on remand

pursuant to the Court of Appeals judgment to explore any
issues of later development in this case.

Ore thing which is a crucial later development is
that the defense is moot in that they do not use these
meruit school trunks , es the affidavits put in by the
ief'enduets make perfectly clear.

of written tests in recruit school was abandoned, and Chief

I think the Court of Appeals judgment

or the perfect test,

but whether it is related to the job?

MR. SOBOL:

Yes, that is my view.

That is the

defendants.’ view and the view of ail the arnica© in the case.
This is a very important question as far as testing is
concerned, that judgments not be made cm face of the test,
that there be necto indication beyond the appearance of the
matter that the test is doing the job it is intended to do,
particularly

in the face of enormous adverse racial impact.

Toe question is whether the impact can be justified, and it
has to- ho justified, in my opinion, by more than just
examination of the face of the test.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Sobol.

Right.

Can we tell by looking at this test whether ox-

MR. lUiivd:

Your Honor, all I can say to yen there

is that the federal government put in an affidavit of a

82
•psychologicst whloh counsel aid not. dispute—the affidavit or
Diane Wilson—which equates the verbal ability of Test 21 with
that required to get through recruit school, and that same
psychologist analysed study materials.
But the most important point X would make--and that
is in response to your question, Mr. Justice Stevens, and
Mr. Justice Powell's question about the correlation between
the test and the high school education requirement--counsel
did not accurately answer that question.
Futransfcy himself points out--and again this is an
undisputed fact on a summary judgment record—at page 100 of
the record, that by Getting a standard of 35 right, an
additional 15 percent of applicants would be eligible.

This

standard would still represent the rending level of at least
the 11th grade.
However, by fairness and by the same logic, it
would represent vorbcl ability below the high school education

Would anything be done about that?

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, I think that we have to

use the term "high school education" in a general sense, as
a work of art, the same way that the President’s Crime
Commission did.

When the President’s Crime Commission used

the. term or expression "high school education," it meant a
proper high school education with its attendant verbal
ability.

The problem is we live in an age, if one can

believe what he hears and reads, that many high school

question is, How does this affect the right of the community

Perhaps that is why Test 21 is added to the

Yes, Your Honor.

That is all I want to know.

I just speak for

That is all I want to know.
MR. SUTTON:

I made a response to your question:

What more do we have besides waving a flag and saying,
"Oh, we’re a model for recruitment"?

We have cold print.

We have statistics which show that between .1965, the effective
date of the Civil Rights Act, and the present, the department8s
black component has increased from 17 percent to 41 percent,
and we do not think this can be ignored.
The other point I would make is that the federal

85

respondents try to downplay the verbal ability, but they
themselves put in the record all kinds of affidavits saying
that verbal ability is a critical factor.
Q

Why is this still a live case? 'Has the

department's test changed?
MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor, it has not.

And in

response to counsel's assertion that we have an intervening
circumstance that would moot the case, we

submit that if

counsel wants to bring a new action, we can prove that verbal
ability is still a critical factor under the department's
current training program, and it gives the same test.
Q

Is Test 21 still given?

MR. SUTTON: It sure is.
Q

But the training program is greatly changed.

MR. SUTTONs

The training program is changed.

But

verbal ability is still a factor.

we discussed this factor of a quota system.

Carter v. Gallagher is a case in

many blacks until you bring the black component of your

from quotas, and this has been upheld notwithstanding
Title VII.
The question was also asked, What, are we going to
do here if we remand the case, subject, the Metropolitan Police
Department to a procedure like that?

We have already done it.

We hired one black policeman for every white policeman.

Fifty-

which we put in our reply brief, are blacks.

How then could

The answer is there are no

wanted to leave that up to Judges Gesell.
