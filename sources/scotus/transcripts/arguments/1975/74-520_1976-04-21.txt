Mr. Lewittes, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL LEWITTES, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEWITTES;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented today is whether the Due Process
Clause requires that an inmats who is transferred within a
State from one maximum security facility to another maximum
security facility, with no imposition of disciplinary penalties,
be afforded notice of the reasons for the transfer and an
opportunity to be heard.
The underlying facts are as follows;
The respondent Haymes was incarcerated at Attica
Correctional Facility in August of 1971.
maximum security facility.

Attica being a

His conviction was for manslaughter

in the first degree.
Attica is one of six maximum security facilities in
the State of New York.
On June 9th, 1972, the respondent Haymes was trans­
ferred from Attica to Clinton, which is another maximum
security facility.

Two days earlier, the prison officials at

Attica had confiscated and seised from Haymes a petition he

4
wa' : circulating on behalf of other inmates.
This document? denominated by the Respondent to be
a petition? was addressed to the District Court of the Western
District of Hew York? and in it claimed -that the discharge
of Eayraes on that very day as a lav? assistant in the Law
Library at the Attica facility had already deprived 82
signatories of that petition of legal assistance*
In addition to -that? the petition also complained
of the various attitudes of the correction officers in charge
of the Lew LibraryQ
A few weeks later? at. the Clinton facility? Haymes
filed a pro se complaint? returnable in the Western District,
of New York? against various Attica officials0

And he raised

two ciairos in that complaint,,
NOo 1? he claimed that the confiscation of the
petition? he v/as entitled to damages for that in the amount
of $.1500 compensatory damages„
And his second claim was that various acts of
retaliation? including the transfer? had been taken against
him and he sought $1500 punitive damages„
With regard to the general claim of retaliation?
only one aspect was pursued by counsel in the district court
and that was the issue of transfer*
In the district court? the court held that? with
regard to the transfer issue? it was dismissable? and it did

5

dismiss it,, holding that even though it was alleged that -the
transfer was punishment., there was no allegation of harsher
or substantially different treatment# since he was transferred
from one maximum security facility to another maximum securi.ty
facility®
However# in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals#
Chief Judge Kaufman pointed out that it simply — all an
inmate had to do was to claim or allege that the transfer was
for punishment# and that 'would entitle him to his day in
court# where he could prove the transfer was punitively
motivated and that the consequences were onerous to him®
The Court did not in any way analyze the facts to
determine whether or not there was indeed an underlying
liberty or property interest involved®
The Court simply defined punishment as harsh treat­
ment meted out to reform# deter or reprimand# and suggested
various consequences that flow from the transfer itselfs
No® 1# there was a claim —* hypothetical claim# I should say
—’ that was sat forth in the opinion of the: Second Circuit
that he would be removed from his family®

The Clinton

facility is several hundred miles away from the Attica
facility from which ha was transferred®
QUESTION;

l suppose it could be just the reverse#

couldn’t it?
MR® LEVJXTTES s

Yes# it certainly could have been

6
He could have been - obviously.» been placed in the Clinton
facility initially, at which point he would have bean 350
miles or so away from his family»
The Court, that is, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals, also suggested that he suffered grievous loss in the
sans© that he be removed from his friends in the prison.
The other suggestion was that there could possibly
ba a loss of property during the time of the transfer»
QUESTION?

Do you think the Second Circuit would

have said he suffered a grievous loss if he had been moved
from one cell block to another in the same prison?

Presumably

he would have been moved away from some of his buddies there»
MR0 LEWITTES;

It would seem that under the

rationale of the Second Circuit, the answer to -that would be
yets*
QUESTION ;

Is that because of the issue raised by

the confiscation of the petition?

Is that why you say they

would treat it the same way?
MR. LEWITTES;

I say treated the came way because

the Court, without analyzing whether or not there was a
property interest or a liberty interest, said that so long as
the inmate subjectively feels that there was punishment
involved, he is entitled to his day in court.
It is clear, in -the hypothetical suggested by Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, 'that a movement from one cell to another

7
cell may be subjectivelyf in the mind of an. inmate, punish­
ment, and therefore would be entitled to his day in court»
And ha may even claim grievous loss, in that his cell is not.
close to 'the cell of a friend of his by reason of the movement
to another cell®
So that was the reason for my affirmative answer,
QUESTIONS

Do you think they could tall an inmate

that if he filed a petition in court he’d be moved to another
cell?

Would that be appropriate treatment, in response to

his exercising a right to write to his lawyer, or something
like that?
MR® LEWITTES %

I think that he could be moved from

any cell within the —
QUESTIONS
prisoners;

In other words, a rule which said to

If you write to your lawyer, you’ll go to cell

block A instead of cell block C*

That would be perfectly

permissible?
MR» LEWITTES;
QUESTION;

If w® indeed are talking about a rule,

Or a practice,

MR* LEWITTES:

Or a practice$

then it is possible

— it can be claimed, at least, that by virtue of this
particular rule or regulation, he had an expectation that he
would remain in that cell.

And it might be possible that —

it could be argued that there was, perhaps, .created some sort
of a liberty interest

8
QUESTIONs Well, is there a liberty interest in not;
being treated differently because of the fact that you file
petitions or write letters to lawyers, or something like that?
MR. LEWITTES %

1 don’t think it's a liberty

interest -that may be involved.

It's the treating differently

that may implicate an equal protection claim.
QUESTION?

Let me just put the questiona little

differently, and then I’ll abandon it.
Da you think, in the disposition by the Court of
Appeals of tills case, any particular significance v/as
attached to the manner in which the whole incident arose?
In other words, to the effect that it grew out of the alleged
confiscation of the --MR. LEWITTESs

I’m sorry, I didn’t hear the last

part of that.
QUESTIONs Well, as I understand it, two days before
the transfer there was allegedly a confiscation of a paper
that he’d been circulating.
MRe LEWITTESs
QUESTION;

That's correct.

How important do you think that background

is in the Court of Appeals’ disposition of the case?
MR. LEWITTES;

I think in their view it was

important, ■—
QUESTION:
or not?

Well, should it have been important

9
MRa LEWXTTES%

1 think not.

No« lf it; is not very clear at all whether that was
the fact that actually triggered the transfer in the first
placec
QUESTIONs Wellf how would one find out without a
trial, whether ~~
MR a LEWXTTESs

We don't have a record here, of

courseo
QUESTIONS So, then, you're saying that there should
b® © trial of that issue, or is it —
MR, LEWXTTES: I don't say there should be a trial,
because the answer to that is that even if he were transferred
for that reason, there is — was no property or liberty
interest involved, and so ~
QUESTIONs

Your position is •— just so I have it

right *— that even if he ware transferred because h© wrote a
latter to his lawyer, say, that that would be a permissible
transfer?
MRo LEWXTTESs

Yes, that would.

QUESTIONs What if the transfer were designed to
not discipline him in tiny general sense, but simply remove
him to a place where he would have no access to his lawyer?
MR. LEWXTTES%

X think that he could then proceed

in a plenary action under 1983, claiming that he was —

QUESTIONS

— but denial of legal -=

MR0 LEWITTESs
QUESTION?

That’s correct»

That’s correcto

In other words,. 1 take it, the

combination of your responses means that if, in fact and in
reality, the move or the transfer inflicts no harm or injury,
that then there is no legal consequence?
MRa LEWITTES:

No, what I’m saying

I’m saying

more than that, Mr« Chief Justice? I’m saying that before
you determine whether or not there is the grievous loss,
whether there is indeed injury, because injury goes to the
weight and not to the nature, you must first determine whether
or not there is a liberty or property interest to be protected
in. the first place»
Once it is determined that there is indeed such an
interest, then we go to see the weight of that interest, and
whether there is indeed grievous loss»

I think that using

grievous loss first puts the cart before the horse»
QUESTIONs Well, do you need to go so far as to say
that, for the purposes of this case, that a punitive — to
pursue what we have been talking about — a

punitive shift

from the twelve o'clock lunch assignment to the one o’clock
assignment, and explicitly stated as such to the prisoner,
is

violates no interest at all?
MRo LEWITTES?

I say it violatos no interest, and

11
if there war© any loss it would be da minimis,
QUESTION;

Yes-, we can concede for the moment that

if the loss or the injury would be da minimis in traditional
terms» but what about the idea that something will be done
to the prisoner if he writes a letter to his lawyer?
Some sort of a psychological impact is bound to occur on him,
isn’t it?
MRo LEWITTESs
QUESTIONs

Yes, I think thatBs true®

However,, —

Of course that would, be the purpose of it,

wouldn’t it?
MRo LEWITTESs

However, the fact is that, transfer

is never used arid is not permitted in the State of New York
to be used as a disciplinary matter„
QUESTIONs Well, sometimes people do tilings they’re
not permitted to do, and then we have a caseo

That’s what

we're confronted with sometimes0
But surely you don’t need to say. do you, that the
State of New York ~~
MR, LEWITTESs
QUESTIONS

No,

I don’t — yes? I —

Change the man’s lunch hour and tell

him that this is a. disciplinary action?
MR, LE'WITTESs

I think the real answer in this

particular case, if I may say so, is that this petition, by
the way, was not a petition by th© Respondent Haymes, by
any means claiming that he was not -- that he was denied

12

access to the courts.

It was a letter written by Haymes on

b@hs.lf of 82 signatories and not before the district court.
And therefore Hr, Haymes would have no standing, in any event,
to raise that issue,
QUESTION;

Well, Mr, Lewittes, perhaps I — I think

maybe your response to the Chief Justice’s question may be
somewhat inconsistent with what I understood your earlier
response to Justice Stevens5 and my questions; but perhaps I*m
wrong,
I thought you ware saying that as long as he’s
challenging the matter here under procedural due process and
not denial of access to the courts or to lawyers, that he had
to establish some sort of liberty or property interest
before you ever got to the question of whether there was
something punitive dona.
And unless ho has a liberty or property interest in
a lunch-hour right, the State is perfectly free to transfer
him from one lunch hour to another and says

We're doing it

because we don't like the way you're acting,
MR. LEWITTESs

1 did say that,

QUESTION; And do you stick to it?
MR. LEWITTESs
QUESTION;

I do,

You don’t see any interference with his

right to go to court?
MR, LEWITTES;

‘There was no interference here at all.

That is* the petition was drawn by

QUESTION; To object to denial of materials to

MR® LEWITTESs

No* that’s not at all what the

petition 'was about®

Well* then* sea if Judge Kaufman is

wrong.
MR® LEWITTESs
QUESTION;

The petition —

"The document charged" — well* you just

wait and lat m© read this®
"The document charged that the library officer
Edward Brady went *out of his way to circumvent inmates

Now, read me what the petition said.
If you want to contradict that»
QUESTION;

Where do w© find that, in the Appendix?

MR. LEWITTESs

Yes, it’s page 13a in the Appendix»

Mot, 13a reads, Mr. Justice Marshalls
851 am writing to complain that I am now being
deprived of legal assistance as a result of inmate Rodney R»
Haymes and John Washington being removed from the prison
law library.”
It did not say that they were being denied access to
tin© courts, that they just wanted these two specific people
to bs in the law library»
QUESTION;

“The major problem and reason for my not

being able to obtain legal assistance is a direct result of'5
tii at.
MR. LEWITTES:

They're claiming that these two

gentlemen — that the removal of. lh.es© two gentlemen from the
law library somehow deprives them of legal assistance? that,
the assumption being, that only Rodney Haymes and John Washing­
ton could assist them.
QUESTION;

Well, I agree that it could be better

done and better worded, but at least they are saying that

15
they have bean denied the right to get that assistance;, legal
assistance,,

They are charging that,

MR, LEWITTES:
QUESTIONs

7iSS.urai.ng

Aren't they?

MR, LEWITTESs

I don't think they are,

I think

that they are claiming that they're unhappy about the discharge
of Rodney Haynes,
But# in any event, Mr, Justic© Marshall, I think the
fact is that that may be a complaint — may be a complaint —»
that could be presented in a 19S3 action by any of the 82
signatories.

But Mr, Rodney Haymes was not a signatory of

that, and Mr, Rodney Haymes is not claiming in any manner
that he was denied access to the courts,
QUESTION: But you agree that the other 82 were?
MR» LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

You agree that the other 82 would have a

cause of action?
MR, LEWITTES:

I think they could claim it,

I’m

not suggesting that — I happen to feel that simply because
Mr, Rodney Haymes and his fellow were removed from the law
library does not present a cause of action, claiming denial
of access.

Whether they want to put it on a complaint, these

inmates could do that? they could raise any kind of contention,
I don’t think it’s a viable contention.
Despite the patent failure, it seems to Petitioners,

16
of the Second Circuit to first analyse the facts,, first to
determine whether or not a liberty or property interest is
involved, both parties here do apparently agree -that the Du©
Process Clause is not implicated unless Haymes can establish
a liberty or property interest at a particular maximum security
prison*
Now, he does not, in any manner, allege a property
interest, sines, by the statute which appears on page 2 of our
brief, the power to transfer is discretionary*,
Rather, Hayraes attempts to construct an independent
liberty interest in his retention at Attica, and he points to
those various hypothetical situations raised in the Second
Circuit opinion*
It is noteworthy, however, that Respondent Haymes
does not allege it: any manner that he suffered any of those
hypothetical consequences„
The motive* which Chief Judge Kaufman referred to in
the Second Circuit, claiming toe motive was punishment here,
we think is not relevant at this point? because what Mr* Haymes
perceives as punishment, as perhaps what Hr* Roth in the Roth
case perceived as grievous loss, does not independently
establish a property or liberty interest*

And without this

property or liberty interest, the motive nor toe result can
ba denominated as disciplinary and does not implicate the Due
Process Clause

17
QUESTION 8

Mr. Lawittes p 1st me ask you one more

questiont if I may»
Supposing that the Respondent here had been appointed
by th@ Warden as kind of a special assistant to help in the
Warden's office, and the Warden was dissatisfied with his
behavior and said:

"I'm going to fire you from the special

assistant position, you're going to go back with the mass of
the prisoners, just to punish you for the way you've been
acting*"
’low,, do you think that would > be a liberty or
property interest?
MR. LEWITTES%
QUESTION:

I do not.

I do not.

Of the assistant to the Warden, or of

the prisoners who had been depending upon him for legal
assistance?
How did you understand Mr. Justice Rehnquist's
question?
MR. LEWITTESs

I understood it. as assistant to the

Warden.
QUESTION:

How do you view the statement in Wolff

that the procedure of due process is implicated if a person is
sent to solitary confinement for breaching a rule?

Is it

because he's promised in advance -chat "you won't be sent there
unless you violate a rule"?
MR. LEWITTES:

That is correct, because by virtue of

18
certain rules and. regulations, it is determined that that is a
punishment, and denominated as a punishment, and -there is no
expectation when one goes to
QUESTIONs

when one is —

Well, I know, but if that’s the only

answer you’re in somewhat unusual trouble here, aren't you?
Don’t you have to -- what is the property or liberty interest?
MR» LEWITTESs
QUESTIONS

The expectation --

Which is what you claim is the

predicate»
MR» LEWITTESs

The expectation would be that one

would normally stay in the general population»
QUESTION s

That the State has made some rules -«

MR» LEWITTES ;
QUESTION;

And that a change

— or published rules which at least

imply that yen.-, won’t be in solitary unless you break a rule?
MR» LEWITTES; That, is correct»

Unless there is &

material change in the terms of your confinement, you have the
expectation that you will remain in the general population»
QUESTION; And the same would be true with respect
to the loss of goodtime credits involved in Wolff?
MR» LEWITTESs

That is absolutely correct»

If there are no more questions, I’d like to reserve;
whatever remaining time I may have»

19
ORAL ARGUMENT* OF ALVIN J. B RON STEIN? ESQ. ?
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
HR® BRONSTEINs

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it please

the Courts
I think the questioning of the Court to my colleague
from New York clarified the issue,, particularly the questions
by Mr. Justice Stevens? as to what the Court of Appeals was
concerned about9 and that was the conduct of Haym.es ? as
alleged in the complaint? which led to the transfer? rather
than the transfer itself®
What has not been discussed yet is the procedural
posture of the case before the Court of Appeals and before
this Court.
The State? in their reply brief filed last Friday?
now concedes that the district court granted a motion to
dismiss? that therefore the allegations of the complaint
must be construed liberally? must be assumed to be true?
and that they have no evidence in the record at this point -bo
contradict the allegations of the complaint.
The Court of Appeals limited its inquiry? it did
not reach the merits in this case.

They limited their

inquiry to whether 'the complaint stated a colorable claim?
and they appropriately remanded it for an evidentiary hearing?
basically on three questions s
Haymes should have the opportunity to prove what his

20
conduct was? if it was protected conduct, then he should have
the opportunity to prove that there was causal connection
between his conduct and the summary punishment# that is the
transfer? and, finally, if both of those could be proved#
whether he suffered injury„
And in the present status f this Court need not
decide the merits of any of -those claims„

Those are

appropriately for th® district court in the first instance0
In the light of the State’s new view of the present
posture of the case# it is immaterial, I believe, at this
point, whether we consider this was a pro se complaint, as we
argue in Point II of our brief, and apply the Haines va Earner
test? or whether it's the traditional rule on a motion to
dismiss under Rule 12, as this Court recently said in Scheuer
y» Rhodes,
In any event, the allegations of the complaint are
assumed to be true and must be read in th© light most
favorable to the plaintiff»
QUESTION:

Under your submission, would it make any

difference whether he was moved from a maximum security
prison 400 miles from his horns base to one ten miles front his
home base, or the reverse of that proposition?
MR e BRQNSTEIN s

It. might only make a difference in

terms of the injury, not in terms of the liberty interest
which we claim

21
QUESTION?

The right would be the same in your

submission?
MRo BRONSTEXNs

That’s right.

What I'm saying,. Mr, Chief: Justice,- is *— ia answer
to, I think, what Mr, Justice Stevens was implying before ~
that 'the State could not punish a prisoner, for example, for
writing a letter to the Department of Justice to complain
about segregated, racially segregated cell blocks.

They

couldn’t punish him by transferring him 400 miles or punish
him by transferring him 20 yards, if he suffered injury*
QUESTIONs

But that’s not a denial of life, liberty

or property without procedural due process, is it?

That’s

burdening a substantiva constitutional right that he had,
MR, BRONSTEINs

That’s right.

That’s — the

liberty interest in this case, Mr, Justice Relinquish,arises at least it is alleged at this point, 'the procedural posture
flows directly from other constitutional rights?

from First,

the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
He was either, depending on how the complaint is
read, engaging in his First Amendment right to petition the
government for' redress of grievances, the act; of circulating
this petition, which h© was obviously going to mail to a
governmental official? or he was engaging in Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendment rights, which ware identified by Mr*
Justice Marshall a while ago*

22
QUESTION*

Bo you think that's what the Second

Circuit relied on?
MRo BRONSTEIN:

1 think the Second Circuit was

concerned about punishment for conduct which, at least on fee
basis of a pro s® complaint, or a complaint liberally
construed, suggested ha was engaged in constitutionally
protected activityo
QUESTION s

The argument you5 re making is not

expressed in fee Court of Appeals
MRo BRONSTEIN:

was it?

Not expressly, because they were

dealing with a case —
QUESTIONS

So you think they reached the right

result, but for a reason which you would like to explain?
MRo BRONSTEIN: Well, I think they reached the right
result, and 1. think there is the suggestion —- although it

nature of 'fee transfer, —™
QUESTION:

Is that enough?
Enough for what, Mr* Justice White?

QUESTIONs

To get relief,, to prove that, you suffered

a grievous loss.
MR. BRONSTEIN:

Well, I think in — -that's not in

ttiis case? that's not what this case is about in its posture,
but I do believe -QUESTIONs

Well, how about the Court of Appeals?

Do you think the Court of Appeals thought that was enough?
MR. BRONSTEIN:

No.

I think the Court of Appeals

talked about the -QUESTIONs And you agree that it wouldn’t be enough?
MR. BRONSTEINs

No, not in another case? S don’t

agree that it wouldn't be enough in another case.
QUESTIONs

Well, you go ahead then, what do you think

the Court of Appeals held?
MR. BRONSTEINs

I think the Court of Appeals held

that, based on the posture of the case, that Hayraes had an
opportunity to prove that ha was engaged in lawful conduct,
or protected conduct, that he was not- violating any regulation
of ths prison? and, in fact, was engaged in -3. constitutionally
protected activity.
QUESTION;

But, hew, those two are quite

different, aren't they?

To say simply he was engaged in

lawful conduct, and to say he was engaged in constitutionally
protected conduct.

Those are quito different.

MR. BRONSTEIN:

They are, indeed, Mr. Justice

24
Rehnquist®
QUESTION;

And which did the Court of Appeals hold?

MR® E RON STEIN;
implied both®

I 'think they discussed both, or

It is not- the clearest decision, I would admit®

QUESTION;

Sure isn't®

MR® BRONSTEINs

But certainly the complaint which

they had before them, and what I wish to stress is that what
this Court is considering now is a case before it in the exact
smae posture as Cooper y„ Pat® or Cruz v, Beto®

A dismissal

of a complaint by the district court, without a hearing, without
any responsive pleadings®
And all we need look at is the complaint®
QUESTION;

Don't you think that the fulcrum on which

the Court of Appeals opinion was based was a denial of
procedural due process?

being punished for some conduct -~
QUESTION;

Without being given sufficient notice

and hearing, and whatever else might be required by the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in its procedural
aspects«

Isn’t that what the Court of Appeals was talking

about?

QUESTION;

I don’t think that was —

You don’t?

alone what they

were saying, Mr®

Appendix* in their opinion, they specifically expressed
concern about the district court deciding that the 15alleged
punitive nature of the transfer was not material"•

15The

alleged punitive nature"»
The alleged punitive nature in the complaint, eight
separate times in the complaint, Haym.es alleges that he was
petitioning the court for redress of grievancesy five separate
times h® alleges that he was punished or retaliated against
for exercising his constitutional right to petition the court
for redress of grievances0
The conduct, therefore, that we — that stands out
to me in the complaint, is based just on those allegations,
conceivably a liberty interest flowing directly from a First
Amendment right —•
QUESTION i

What, would the hearings be about?

MR. BRONSTEIN s

What would the hearings foe. about?

Before the district court or on the —
QUESTIONs

No.

He claims he was entitled to a

hearing before h© was transferred.
MR. BRONSTEIN:
QUESTION 5

That's right.

The hearing —

So what would the hearing h© about?

MR. BRONSTEINs The hearing would be to determine
whether or not ha was engaged in protected activity, —

MRa BRONSTEIN s

I think it — it first is a factual

question®
QUESTIONs Well; there’s no question about what he

there?

He was circulating this piece of paper®

There isn’t any question about what his physical acts were,

No, but the State —

that®
MR® BRONSTEIN2

No, but the State might have the

opportunity under the balancing test; that tills Court —
QUESTIONS

You think there just ought to be an

argument on them all®
MR® BRONSTEINs

No®

No®

Because the State would

hav® to com© in then and respond ‘to what their interest would
be in —
QUESTIONS

In short, you want to argue about the

law, that’s right? and you want to gat to the merits of
whether they would be entitled to transfer him for allegedly
violating the rule®
MR, BRONSTEINt

Ho®

First, we’d have to decide if

a rule was violated? secondly, whether ~ if it wasn't, whether
he was engaging in constitutionally protected activity?
thirdly, was tee State’s interest involved because some
disturbance seemed imminent, the kind of balancing teat this

27

Court talked about in Procuniar v0 Martin©s.
QUESTIONt

Do you think there really is any

factual, historical factual question like, who did what to whom?
Or what actually happened on a certain day?
MR® BROKSTEINs

Yes„

MR, ERONSTEINs

In this case?

Well, --

There9s no accuracy problem here, is

there, about what his conduct was?
MR* ERONSTEINs

Wall, ttx®re seems

there is some,

district court, then there is some conflict®

I don't think

that the affidavits can be considered —
QUESTION:

There might be some conflict of how

to characterise them, but not about actually what he did®
MR® BROKSTEINs Well, there are a number of factual
controversies®

Apparently his records indicate that he was

It does»’t

It merely says “illicit activity

So there are a number of factual controversies, if

you look beyond the claim®

28
QUESTIONS Well, what liberty interest was involved
in that allegation?
MR. BRONSTEINs
QUESTIONs

Pardon?

What liberty interest was involved in

that;, in his job in the library?
MR* BRONSTEINs

I don’t think that — I don’t think

his job in the library is in this case.

I’m merely showing

that the — his central file says that he was transferred
because of his activity in th® law library , thereby indicating
that there is a factual controversy,, if there were a hearing*
He claims he was transferred because he was circulating a.
petition in the yard*
His central file seems to suggest otherwise.
QUESTIONs

Well; why, under your submission, you

say h® should have a «**■• entitled to a right to argue about
whether or not, under the balancing constitutional conduct, it
could be dealt with this way by the prison authorities?

You

also say he should have a right to a hearing as to whether he
violated a rui©.

I don’t see why that’s -*«* why the latter

followso
MR. BRONSTEINs

Oh.

Only if the evidence were to

indicate that th© State's claim that he did violate a rule
was material.

Th® State would —-

MR« BRONSTEIN?

I don't think they -«* I don't think

feat's in this case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTIONi

Then why should there ha a hearing about

that?
MR. BRONSTEIN? Wall, if the rule were to infringe
on a separate protected liberty interest, if the rule were to
sayr as Mr. Justice Stevens, I think, asked before?

"You

may not write to your lawyer, otherwise we will transfer
you? or you nay not complain to the Department of Justice
about racial segregation, otherwise w© will transfer you",
then the rule would certainly b@ at issue.
QUESTION? Well, let's go back to the beginning.
a

If

man is sentenced, he is sentenced to the custody of fee

correctional authority in New York, is he not?
MR. BRONSTEIN?
QUESTION?

That is true, Your Honor.

And administratively he is then assigned

to an institution; is feat correct?
MR. BRONSTEIN?

That's correct.

QUESTION: Well, suppose they advise him, or he
learns that he's going to be sent to Attica, and he says,.
"No, Attica has had a terrible history, and it's a dangerous
place, and I want to go somewhere els®, and I want a. hearing.e:
Is he entitled to a hearing?
MR. BRONSTEIN? Well, first, Mr. Chief Justice, that,

30

I believe, respectfully, is not what’s involved in this case#
QUESTION3

Nof I know that’s not what's here, but 1

MR. BRONSTEXNs
QUESTIONs

But 1 -think ~

~~ we’re trying to sort out what is her©,

and I find great difficulty so far.
MR. BRONSTEINs All right.

Well, I think in the

question, in the hypothetical that you postulate, some minimal
inquiry should be made in the facts that, you make.

In fact,

that's what the prison officials do,
QUESTIONS

You mean a hearing —

MR. BRONSTEINs

Before a prisoner is assigned to

Attica or Clinton, or, in the federal system, to Leavenworth
or Danbury, a

case worker or classification officer meets

with the prisoner, finds out what his potentials are» what his
problems are, what his interests are, and then makes a
decision —
QUESTION'S

But h© doesn’t ask the prisoner, the

convicted person’s opinion as to where he ought to be
assigned, does he?
MR. BRONSTEINs Well, I think in some cases they do.
They ask, "Where is your family? Do you have a preference for
being near the family?
QUESTIONs

Are you close to your family?"

That’s getting factual information, not

an expression of desires.
MR. BRONSTEINs

Well, -that’s — in the hypothetical

31
you postulat©, which is not our case, where we claim separate
protected interests, it is factual information that is
essential before the prison officials exercise the discretion
that I would concede, in your situation, that they have.
Merely get accurate facts before you exercise your discretion.
QUESTIONS

Well, do they have to get any facts'?

Suppose the prison authorities, simply as a rotation,
and right in straight rotation, all people assigned to
maximum security prisons are — if they have three of them,
every third man goes to one of them.

No consultation, no

inquiry, no hearing.
Are you suggesting that there’s some -property or
liberty interest in the first instance?
i

MR. BRONSTEINs

I think in ©very instance, where a

prisoner will suffer injury or will be faced with more
adverse consequences, as a result of his condition of
confinement,as the Court discussed in Footnote 19 in Wolff,
teat in each of those instances the admittedly discretionary
authority of the corrections official requires some examina­
tion into the facts.

The kind of examination might be vary,

very minimal in the hypothetical you postulate.

It should be

much more serious in a situation such as the ones in Wolff,
where person could lose his good-time credits.
QUESTIONs

Well, let ms make it concrete, then.

Let's assume you've got — how many maximum security prisons

32
do you have in New York, do you know?
MR. BROMSTEINs

I'm not sure? I think there are

four or five.
QUESTIONs
there are four.

Let's assume, then -- well, all right.,

He's assigned to on© that is 400 miles away

from his home, and he demands a hearing and says that he wants
to be at. the one nearest to his home.
Does he have a property or liberty interest, or any
kind of an interest in where he's to be assigned in the first
instance?
MR. BRONSTEINs

I think there is some very, very

limited interest, the kind of interest that Mr. Justice
Douglas talked about in his concurring and dissenting opinion
in Wolff, «—
QUESTIONs
MR.

A constitutionally protected interest?

BROMSTEIN:

An interest flowing from the core

value of the liberty concerns of the Due Process Clause, that
this Court has talked on on occasion; where there is injury as
the result of arbitrary or — arbitrary actions of the
administrator.
I'm not suggesting that a Wolff hearing would be
required in a whole range of decision areas or decision points.
Certainly, at the initial designation, the classification
people may have all the facts before them that they need from
his pre-sentence record, from his probation report before he

33
is sentenced*,

If they have those facts , then perhaps merely

finding out where his family is, or if he has any particular
educational or vocational aspirations, that might be all that
would be necessary*,
QUESTION'S

What is the constitutional right that

he be near his family?
MR, BRONSTEINs Well, it*s not the constitutional
right to be near your family? it’s a constitutional -QUESTIONs

Well, can’t the State stop his family

MR» BRONSTEINs Well, I — it’s not in this case,

MR, BRONSTEIN:

Precisely,

And that that which is

enough in the complaint, in terms of the substantive right,
has b-sen recognised by this court already, if he can prove it..

37

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL LEWXTTES, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEWXTTES t

It is clear that the Respondent has

completely turned the course here.

The issues he now raises

ware raised in only Footnote 20 to his brief, on page 20?
but it*s interesting to note that Mr. Rodney Hayraes, although
he alleged several claims of retaliation in his petition,
only on© aspect has been pursued both in the district court
and in the Court of Appeals j and -.that had to do with the
procedural due process issue* whether he was entitled to
notice of hearing.

that he was transferred for prohibitive reasons? that is,
