PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in NO. 74-1396, Michelin Tire Corporation versus W. L.
Wages, Tax Commissioner.
Mr. May, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE B. MAY, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Please

the Court:
This is a case which involves the import clause
of the Federal Constitution and the proper interpretation
and application of that clause to imported tires and tubes.
The sole issue is whether tires imported without
packaging and held for the sale by the importor in his ware­
house in the original form in which imported or immune from
local ad valorem taxes by reason of the import clause.
The trial court upheld the importer's claim of
immunity with respect to both tires and tubes.
The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed with
respect to the tubes but reversed with respect to the tires,
notwithstanding the fact that both the tires and the tubes
are handled precisely in the same manner while in the
importer’s warehouse.
QUESTION:

The state has taken no cross-petition

from the decision adverse to it in the Supreme Court of

4
Georgia.
MR. MAY:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

except the state is not actually the party.

It is the local

Gwinnett County tax officials —
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:

The tax officials of Gwinnett County.
— who impose the taxes, of course,

pursuant to Georgia Constitutional provisions but the State
of Georgia as such is not a party
QUESTION:

to this case.

Well, I suppose your argument that

you suggested a moment ago that the Supreme Court of Georgia8s
decision is wrong because it Ins treated differently two
things that are alike wouldn’t necessarily win for you here.
Maybe it was wrong in ruling that the tool boxes
ware not taxable.
MR. MAY:

That could well be, your Honor, but it

is our position, contrary to what you just said, that we do
think that if the result of the Georgia Supreme Court
decision is to accord less immunity to an unpackaged import
than ,that accorded to a packaged import, that it is wrong
''because the constitutional prohibition is to command immunity
for all imports, whether packaged or unpackaged,,
QUESTION:

But you have got to make your comparison

with some authoritative decision on the liability for a
packaged import,
have been wrong

I mean, the Supreme Court of Georgia may

MR., MAY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»
-— to the extent it decided against

the assessor,
MR,, MAY:

Well, we submit there are numerous

decisions of this Court which clearly recognize tax
immunity for packaged imports, if the Court please.
The facts are very brief, may it please the Court,
The importer is a New York corporation engaged in
the business of importing and distributing wholesale tires
and tubes that are manufactured outside the United States
and as a part of its business it operates a distribution
warehouse in Gwinett
QUESTION:

County, Georgia.

The tires are —

Do these tubes fit any other tires

than Michelin tires?
MR. MAY:

If your Honor please, I don't, believe

that answer is in the record and I don't honestly know.

I

believe the answer would be no, Mr. Chief Justice, but I
cannot answer that precisely.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it we are not concerned

with the tubes in this case, are we?
MR. MAY:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

except to the extent that our argument that the decision of
the Georgia court accords unequal treatment to packaged and
unpackaged imports.

To that extent the Court might be

concerned with it, but there was no cross-petition filed by

the tax officials.
QUESTION;

I suppose if you lose, your client

can start packaging its tires and then you have something
in parallel.
MR. MAY:

Well, that would he one way under the

present decision of the Georgia Supreme Court that our client
could avoid taxation by putting each tire in a separate
package so long as the package was not broken and the tire
would —- if the Georgia Supreme Court is to be consistent,
would be immune from taxation.
QUESTION:

Or another way would be to separate them

by style and size at the point of origin.
MR. MAY:
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:

Yes, sir.
In Nova Scotia or France.
Or France, yes, sir.

The facts show that no sa3.es are made to retail
customers.

All sales are made at wholesale and on all such

imported tires and tubes the importer has paid to the United
States the

four percent import duty.
The tires are imported without packaging and are

never altered or modified in any way from the original form
in which they were imported.
Noxf, the Supreme Court of Georgia, may it please
the Court, expressly recognised at page A-7 of the Appendix
to the Petition for Certiorari that the individual tires are

not treated or altered in any manner but they nevertheless
denied immunity upon the ground — as shown at page A-18
of the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari — that the
tires had lost their status as imports when they were
segregated by size and style and stacked in the importer's
warehouse with other similar imported tires of the same
size and style and it is this decision, may it please the
Court, which is presently here for review.
And we believe the decision is erroneous and our
contentions are based primarily upon four factors:
Number one, the original form had not been
changed.
Number two, the tires were still in the form of
import distribution and had not reached the point of final
destination,as they had in Youngstown, Mr. Justice Stewart.
The right to sell, which has never been seriously
challenged until now, the importer's right to sell and,
Fourth, the unequal treatment accorded unpackaged
imports as compared with packaged imports — as we were just
discussing

with Mr. Justice Hehnquist.
First, it is undisputed, your Honors, that the

tires were imported without packaging and at all times
remained the property of the importer in his warehouse in
the original form in which imported.
Arid in 1827 this Court held in Brown versus

3

Maryland, in Chief Justice Marshall's landmark decision that
where the thing imported, if it please the Court, remains
the property of the importer in his warehouse in the original
form or package in which it was imported — and I quote, "A
tax upon it is

too plainly a duty on imports to escape

the prohibition in the

Constitution."

References to the term, "original, form" are found
in many subsequent decisions of this Court and we suggest
that the plain and natural meaning of those words is that
where an article is imported without packaging, holding such
an article in its unaltered, original form in which
imported is equivalent to holding

packaged import in the

original package in v/hich it was imported and that is the
meaning which has been given these words by the courts of
Mew York, Florida .-.net North Carolina and in our judgment
was the meaning intended by Chief Justice Marshall.
Here, the Georgia court ignored and disregarded
the words "original form" completely.

They treated them as

being completely meaningless and that is precisely what the
tax officials in this case are asking this Court to do and
we suggest respectfully that the Court has not done so for
nearly 150 years and no persuasive reason has been or can be
advanced for doing so at this time.
The second factor that we rely upon is what we
call the final destination factor.

It is undisputed that

9
the tires

are still in the flow of import distribution,

have not reached their final destination.

The importation

journey has not definitely ended nor have the tires bean
irrevocably committed to the use for which they imported.
QUESTION s

You are not suggesting that the journey

wouldn't be ended until they"ware put on an automobile, are
i
you?
MR. MAYs
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.
Where do you think the journey would

end?
MR. MAY:

The journey would end, Mr. Chief Justice

in my opinion, at the point at which the tires had reached
a retail selling-type operation where they were to be sold
at retail for local consumption at the. point of final
destination.
QUESTION:

Maybe that is another way that your

client can avoid the taxes, to ship directly to the retailer,
from France or Nova Scotia.

It might take a little doing

but I suppose it could be done.
MR. MAYs
W>3

I suppose it could, Mr. Justice Blackmun

haven't explored that possibility at this point.
But I .say that, Mr. Chief Justice, because one —

as we all know, one of the important reasons for the
inclusion of the import clause in the Federal Constitution
was the desire of the framers to prevent taxation by seaboard

10
states with their great ports of entry, of imported goods
flowing through to inland states and that was plainly stated
in Brown versus Maryland and this Court reaffirmed it in the
1959 Youngstown decision where the Court said, the Constitu­
tional design was to immunize imports from taxation by the
importing states and all others.
QUESTION:

Of course, Brown against Maryland was

a tax on the requirement of a license on someone who sold
imports.

It wasn’t a general ad valorem property.
MR. MAY:

That is correct, your Honor,

but the

arguments that a general ad valorem nondiscriminatory ad
valorem tax is not prohibited by the import clause have been
consistently rejected by this Court
QtT;V’IX' ;

for more than 100 years.

What do you mak- of the case of May

against New Orleans?
MR. MAY:

I think May versus New Orleans,

Mr. Justice Relinquish, was purely an original package case.
I think it is premised totally upon original package,

The

court held that the wooden crates in which the boxes were
contained were the original package and whan they were broken
the importer lost his immunity.
QUESTION:
pronounce it

You don’t think, thenf that —- do you

Gwin-nett or Gwinet?

MR. MAY:

Gwin-nett, your Honor,

QUESTION:

You don't think that Gwinnett County

II
is entitled to any sort of pro rata contribution from your
client for the fire protection or the police protection that
it provides for your client’s warehouse, even though it gets
pro rata contributions from other people who get exactly the
same services?
MR. MAY:

May

I answer that in two ways,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:

In as many ways as you want.
I would point out, number one, that

Gwinnett County does receive taxation from the Michelin
property, which is the land and the building and the type­
writers, the desks, that type of property.
is paid by my client to the county.

Ad valorem taxes

No exemption is claimed.

With respect to the other aspect of the question,
ny answer is no,

I do not think, that Gwinnett County is

entitled to tax my property, which is an import, so long as
it remains an import and the reason I say that is because the
Constitution prohibits it and it is an absolute prohibition
contained irt the Constitution and there is but one exception
and that is,"No state shall, without the consent of Congress,
lay any tax upon an import except xvhat may be absolutely
necessary to inspect -—"
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:

I thought it said, "Impose duties."
Well, i.t does, but that has been

construed to include a general ad valorem tax.

12
Low versus Austin, in 1872, the Court held that.
California made that argument.
California made the same argument again in 1946
in Richfield Oil and the Court again rejected it in an
opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas where he said that it would
entail substantial revisions of the language of the import
clause to substitute for the prohibition against any tax the
words "Any discriminatory tax."
And so for those reasons, I respectfully answer
your Honor's question by saying that, no, I do not think my
goods should be required to bear a part of that protection.
the expense of protecting the property.
Coming back now,if 1 may for a moment, to the
final destination factox*, we submit that that is essential
and vital to a determination of whether the tires are still
in the flow of import distribution and are therefore still
imports.

The Georgia court disregarded this fact and to do

so is to lose sight of the underlying -— one of the under­
lying purposes of the import clause and the issue which
really lies 'at the very heart of this case and that is, if
it please the Court, whether the tires have retained their
distinctive character as imports and I can't think of a better
case to demonstrate this than this Court's decision in
Youngstown, where the Court held that the ore and lumber there
involved had lost their distinctive character as imports and

13
in so doing, the Court gave major weight to two factors,
one, the

importation journey definitely had ended and two,

the articles had been irrevocably committed to use in
manufacturing at the point of final destination.
We respectfully suggest to the Court that the same
consideration should be

given the final destination factor

here because here, in sharp contrast, if the Court please,
to the facts in Youngstown, we have undisputed evidence which
shows, first, the tires are imported for sale and sold only
at wholesale,
Two, they flow out from the importer's warehouse
to franchised dealers in six states in the original form in
which imported and,
Three, it is such dealers who sell the tires at
retail for local consumption at the point of final destination and we respectfully submit that under those circumstances,
while the tires are in the

improter's warehouse, they have

neither completed their import journeynor have they been
irrevocalby committed to use at the point of final
destination.
On the contrary, they are, in the language of
Cheif Justice Tarney, if I may be permitted to quote a brief
statement of the Chief Justice, “Merely in transitu and on
their way to the distant, cities, villages and country for
which they are destined and where they are expected to be

14
used and consumed and for the supply of which they were,, in
truth, imported."
'‘.'hat precise language from the license cases was
quoted in the Youngstown decision in 1959 and we submit it is
clearly applicable hare and as, under these circumstances,
the tires fall squarely within the underlying purposes of the
import clause and clearly retain their status as imports.
Moving along, our third factor, may it please the
Court, is the importer's right to sell its goods free from
local taxation.

Again, referring to Brown versus Maryland,

it plainly held that one who had imported goods for the
purpose of selling them had, by payment of the import duty
to the United States, acquired not only the right to bring
the goods into the country, but also the right to sell the
goods free from local taxation in their original form of
package.
QUESTION:

It didn't hold that, because what

was dealing with was a license tax

it

on one who sought to

sell imports.
I mean, you can say that Justice Marshall said it
xn the opinion, but I don't believe it was a holding.
MR. MAY:

Well, I

wouldn't argue, your Honor,

that that may not have been the specific holding of Brown
versus Hary1and, but that certainly is the interpretation
which has been placed upon that decision by this Court for

15
almost 150 years.
QUESTION:

Would you say that once tha man

once an importer pays a duty exacted by the Federal Government,
no further tax

burden of any sort may be placed on his sale

of those goods that are imported?

You wouldn't go that far,

would you?
MR. MAY:
Rehnquist.

I would, with one exception, Mr. Justice

If the article which has been imported is still

held by the importer in its original form or package in which
imported but if the importation process has ended and the
article is being exposed for sale at retail for local
consumption at the point of final destineition, it may well
be that when such a case comes before this Court, that the
Court would hold that it, irrespective of the fact that it is
still in the original form, that it has lost its distinctive
character as an import and become subject to taxes.
QUESTION:

When you distinguish between wholesale

and retail, what is there in the import clause that leads to
that conclusion?
MR. MAY:

Well, the import clause prohibits

taxation upon any import,

The way the wholesale factor comes

into it is that in a wholesale distribution process, the
goods are still flowing through.

They have not reached the

point, as Youngstown said, the importation journey has not
definitely ended.

16

QUESTION:
retail goods?

Well, can’t you say the same with

They are still flowing and you don't know who

the ultimate purchaser is going to be,
MRa MAY:

Yes, sir, that argument can be made but

I think, it is logical to assume that there is no further
flow-through once a tire or any other imported article
reaches a retail outlet which is selling to local customers.
I concede there may be an instance where

somebody

from Alabama could come into Georgia at a retail tire store
and buy a set of tires and they may wind up in Alabama but
I submit to your Honor that that would be the exception
rather than the rule.
QUESTION:

Mr. May, it is of no import, I suppose,

I don't mean that as a pun, either, but how much tax are we
talking about hare annually, roughly?
MR. MAY:

Your Honor, I will give my guesfcimate.

I think it is in the neighborhood of $10,000 par year.

The

counsel for the county could probably give a more accurate
answer.
QUESTION:

It is the same principal, whether it

is $300 or a million, I suppose.
MR. MAY:
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:
QUESTION j

Yes, sir.
Mr, May?
Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Powell.
You are arguing your third point which

17
as I understand it, is that the importer has a right to sell
in this country.

Dees that suggest that if the wholesaler

had been an American wholesaler, an American

corporation and Michelin had sold these tires to it, that the
clause would not apply?
MR. MAYj

If Michelin were the importer — do I

understand you correctly?
QUESTION:

No, Michelin is exporter, Michelin in

France.
MR. MAY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Makes a contract to sell to a Georgia

Let's take this warehouse.

Assume that it were

owned by a Georgia corporation —
MR. MAY;
QUESTION:

Right.
— and everything else were the same,

would the clause apply?
MR. MAY:

It would, in my judgment, Mr. Justice

Powell, if the Georgia corporation is deemed to be the
importer because Chief Justice Marshall said the? property —■
the thing imported, while remaining the property of the
importer, in his warehouse in the original form of packaging,
so if your question includes the Georgia corporation which
you suggest as the importer —
QUESTION:
MR. MAYs

Right.
-- and it is his warehouse and everything

18

else is the same, yes, sir, then my answer would be,

the

clause would apply.
QUESTION:

Then you are saying there must be, in

those circumstances, two sales, one from the manufacturer in
France to the Georgia importer and then a second sale by the
Georgia importer sent to an American retailer.
MR. MAY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:
put this question?

While I have you interrupted, may I
It may not be entirely relevant but I

would be interested in your answer.
Suppose these tires had been manufactured in
Michigan, by U. S„ Rubber Company, for example, and shipped
to a Georgia warehouse and handled precisely as these tires
were handled?
Under the Commerce Clause could Georgia validly
have imposed a property tax?
MR. MAY:

I think they could, Mr. justice Powell,

provided the goods were — the transit had stopped And they
were exactly the same?
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:

Exactly the same.
Yes, sir, but as you are obviously

aware, this Court has — again, for 100 years

mad®

.

distinctions in. the cases involving interstate commerce —
QUESTION:
MR. MAY:

I understand.
— and imports and of course, we all

19

know the reason for that because the import clause has an
absolute prohibition whereas the Commerce clause is nothing
but —
QUESTION:
retail.

Mr, May, you put so much emphasis on

It doesn't really mean that much, does it?

Wouldn't

the wholesaler be in the same — I mean, you transport them
from here to the wholesaler in Michigan, say, 100 tires.
When they get there, it is over, isn’t it?
MR. MAY;

Mo, sir, not under the facts in this

record, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, there are wholesalers that —

for example, you and I know that fleets of
of trucks buy tires wholesale.

could go larger and be a wholesaler?

HR. MAY:

I don't think it hurts your case.
I guess it is conceivable, Mr. Justice

Marshall, that that could be true, if the correct facts
existed, yes.
QUESTION:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

In other words, if they were sent out

from the Gwinnett County warehouse to wholesalers in six
states, your case would be the same as if they had
sent to retailers.
MR. MAY:

been

That was my brother Justice’s question.
Because they are still in the flow.

Well, maybe I misunderstood Justice Marshall's question but
I think I have answered it, that I agree with you.
My final point, if the Court please, I think I
didn't finish the right to sell.

It is unquestioned here

that we paid the four percent import duty and we say that by
so doing we acquired the right not only to import the tires
but to sell them and until they are sold, they retain their
statues as imports.
And the final factor is that unpackaged imports,
in our judgment, should not foe accorded a lesser degree of
immunity than that which is generally recognized for
package imports and that is precisely the result which the
Georgia Supreme' Court arrived at and in so doing, we think
that it violated longstanding and fundamental constitutional
prohibitions because the intent and purpose of the import

21
clause was to command a uniform degree of immunity for all
imports, whether packaged or unpaekaged and unless we are to
ignore that constitutional command, it cannot be success­
fully argued that unpackaged imports are entitled to lass
immunity than packaged imports.
Mr. Chief Justice, I'll reserve the balance of ray
time to respond to ray opponents.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Stephens.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. A. STEPHENS, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. STEPHENS:

!flr. Chief Justice,, and may it

please the Court:
Argument in behalf of the Respondents, I
respectfully submit, should begin by noting that the right
of a state and its political subdivisions to levy nondiscriminatory ad valorem taxes on property located within
V

its boundaries is an inherent attribute of sovereignty.
The Constitution of Georgia so declares.

Its

taxation scheme expressly states that the property of non­
residents shall not be taxed higher than that of residents.
So there is no contention her® on the part of the
Petitioner that there has been any discrimination against
Petitioner on the ground that it is a nonresident of Georgia
rather than a resident

22
Now, at the

last term, as is fully known to the

members of the Court, in the National Cash Register case,
there was a determination as to when American-made goods
possessing very unique qualities unsuited for use except
by some foreign nation when they become exports and in this
particular case, to some extent the reverse side of the coin
is before the Court and that is, when foreign-made goods
actually cease to be imports.
Now, the Georgia Supreme Court, after cataloguing
numerous cases, concluded that the — in the language of
Hr. Justice Goddard, that the cases established a sort of
two hat approach to the import process and it depends on
which hat the particular concern is wearing, whether that of
an importer or that of a wholesaler and, certainly, the
Supreme Court of Georgia spent some time analysing Brown
against Maryland and it is obvious that the Supreme Court
in Georgia had no desire to ignore the holdings of that
court, that particular decision.
But it did lay emphasis upon the factual aspect
of this particular situation and while it is not a lengthy
record, you begin with the first specific matter, which is
that Michelin owns a warehouse in Gwinnett County, Georgia
on the north side of Atlanta and utilises a bonded warehouse
in Clayton County, Georgia, on the south side of Atlanta?
thereby, a permanent distribution center has been set up in

23

the Atlanta area.
Bulk shipments of tires enclosed in C vans and
over-the-road containers, arrive at these warehouses at
recurring intervals.
The C vans and over-the-road containers are
opened, entry is made into them and the tires are placed
on pallets.
Each pallet, with tires loaded on it, is then
moved into the warehouse.

The tires are segregated "ay size

and style, as was mentioned by Mr. Justice Blaekmun.

They

are then stacked — four stacks of five tires each on a
pallet with a heavy cardboard core put down between it and
another

pallet of three tires placed over it.
There is no question but a new shipment is

introduced into that warehouse with a residue of what has
been left from previous shipments and, furthermore, that
shipments arriving from France and shipments arriving from
Nova Scotia are distinguishable only by the words"Made in
France!! or "Made in Canada" appearing on it.
Then the process of getting them out of the
warehouse was developed.

Orders received by Micheline in

Gwinnett County, Georgia, at its facility there on Highway
85 are filled from this

* I am going to use the words

"commingled inventory" because I submit that is what it
shows has occurred.

They are shipped by common carrier,

United Parcel Service, or a dealer»
QUESTION s

Does this record show whether the tires

that were resting in the warehouse at the time of the arrival
of the shipment were subjected to a tax?
I am speaking now of this record.
MR. STEPHENS:
QUESTION^

[No response.]

Now, did you say they comingled, they

had to comingle with something.
MR. STEPHENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Now, are those tires to which the

current "imports" were added, were those tires subjected to
a state tax?
MR. STEPHENS:

No, sir, those were imports.

One thing developed in the course of the trial
before Judge Pittard in Gwinnett Superior Court and it was
discovered that a small quantity of domestic-made tubes were
left over from a previous year and as I remember, they
figured a small amount of tax and paid, it in the courtroom
as part of the hearing.

They realized that was not exempt.

Previous imports were —
QUESTION:

What I am trying to got at is, has

your client just begun to levy tax on these tires for the
first time?
MR. STEPHENS:

Yes, sir, they ware what is known

sis NOD assessments and of course, as the record indicates

25

at one point, there are approximately five other import firms
located in the county.

That is a by-product of interstate

highways, your Honor, in North Atlanta, four-lane highways
on either side,

warehousing, so there are other import firms

in the county.
QUESTION 2

How does Gwinnett County mechanically

go about levying its tax in this case?

Does the assessor

come around one© a year to every place?
MR. STEPHENS:

Well, theoretically, your Honor,

all concerns are supposed to like,

[be] paying income taxes

voluntarily —
;

*

\

QUESTION s

Self-assessment.

MR. STEPHENS:

It is a self-assessment situation.

If the investigator for the tax assessors concludes that
maybe a return was due or not enough property was covered,
he will go out and make an inspection on the premises then.
QUESTION s

But as of a particular date each year?

MR. STEPHENS:

Yes, sir, January one of each

year is the critical date for ad

valorem tax purposes in

Georgia.
It is the position of the Respondents, may it
please the Court, that this matter is, in reality, controlled
by May against New Orleans, which has already been mentioned
by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and discussed to some extent, by
the philosophy of Burke against Wells.

26

That is the case in Hew York City in which an
import firm established a wareroom and was vending in the
original package, articles imported from Ireland and the
State of New York, instead of issuing an ad valorem assess­
ment on the property itself, issued an assessment on the
capital of the company utilized in that particular process
which was retained from the sales of the goods but much of
the language in that opinion indicates that if it had been
an ad valorem assessment, the result would have been the
same because the court, in its opinion, went back to Brown
against Mary 1 and, dis mussed when the original package
doctrine loses its force or validity and placed the two in
exactly the same context.
Wow, as to what an original package is, in our
brief we have stressed a line of cases holding that if, as
th.j Supreme Court of Georgia did, the C van or .ovar-the-road
container concept is rejected as the original package, that
the aggregation of goods is a definition which emerged very
early in jurisprudence, in the Austin case from Tennessee,
d that the aggregation of goods where they are not
individually wrapped constitutes the original package and
we rely upon E»J. Stanton and Sons* case from California in
which it was referred to as "invisible gossamer" and that is
language to which the Petitioner took strong exception in
the Petition for

Certiorari and in the briefs but it merely

27
illustrates the principle that an aggregation of goods or as
the Supreme Court of Ohio termed it, the"commercial unit of
imprefcation", when that is broken, the package is broken
and in this particular case,when Michelin established a.
distribution center in Gwinnett County, Georgia and even in
Clayton County, Georgia, although they are not a party here,
and on a regular, sustained, recurring basis, just as in
Burke against Wells in New York, on a week-to-week, day-today, month-to-month basis, had goods available for shipment,
received goods to replace those shipped, we submit, if this
Court please, that that really is the end of the importation
process and that the Supreme

Court of Georgia correctly so

determinedo
QUESTION:

P4r. Stephens, is this — I ask, as I

always do, in Ignorance — is the fact situation here some­
what similar to what I have seen of photographs of ships
coming in to Baltimore loaded with VW's on the decks.
aren't wrapped.,

They

I don't know whether you have something at

Savannah comparable to that, but do you think the State of
Maryland could impose an ad valorem tax on those automobiles
as they are taken off the ship and warehoused there in
Baltimore?
MR. STEPHENS;
QUESTION:

I believe that is —

I don't know whether they do.

I am

just — it seems to me that this is somewhat comparable to

28

that.
MR. STEPHENS:

I believe that was the holding of

the Volkswagen Pacific case from California, your Honor;, that
is referred to in the briefs.
In that particular case, the facts were packaged
automobile parts and completed VW and Porsche automobiles
were being brought in by seagoing vessels and as I remember,
the

— and don’t hold me to this because I haven’t read this

case to date — as I remember, the packaged auto parts were
held exempt, but the automobiles had to have things done to
them to get them ready and while the outward form or shape
of the vehicle was not changed, it could no longer be in
the original form because of the difference between being
able to crank it up and drive it away and not crank it up
and drive it away.
I believe the California case has ruled on that
and as I remember, this Court declined to grant certiorari
in that particular case which, I fully appreciate, is not
very decisive.
Now, as to the statement in Brown ag.aiii.st Maryland,
which has been urged by Petitioner's counsel here, in a foot™
note to our brief, we invited attention to an article by
Professor Thomas Reid Powell.

I was never

so fortunate as

to attend that university or be one of his students but I
always regarded him as a very outstanding writer and his

29

comment was that the language of Mr. Marshall certainly
was broad enough to call sale or use or breaking book and
we submit that when an import firm gets into the distribution
business, such as is shown by the record in this case, that
the maintaining of the tires for inventory to meet the test
of use as referred to in Youngstown and it certainly meets
the test of Burke against Wells where they had a permanent
wareroom in Maw York City and were vending from the original
package.
QUESTION s

The —

MR. STEPHENS:

If Court will bear with me, I'd

like to conclude with just one quote from May against. Mew
Orleans: "The goods imported lost their distinctive character
as imports and became a part of the general mass of property
of Louisiana and subject tc local taxation as other property
?

in that state.

The mope, the boxes, cases or bales in which

they were shipped reached their destination for use or trade
and were opened into separate packages there and exposed
for sale.'1
Mow, we submit that the breaking of a bulk
shipment of tires, the aggregation of goods, the commercial
meaning of imputation or whatever it is and the exposing
of the individual tiros for sales, when that occurs, the
import process has terminated and just as the Supreme Court
of Georgia said^ "Then the concern doffs the hat ■— dons the

30

hat. I'm sorry, of a wholesaler."
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you

have anything

further, Mr. May?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE B. MAY, JR., ESQ.
MR. MAY:

Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd

like to make three quick comments.
Number one, in answer to your question that you
posed to Mr. Stephens, the record shows that all tires in
the warehouse were imported and none had sought to be taxed
prior to the first taxable year here involved.
QUESTION:

I suppose that means no more than,

there is always a first time to levy a tax.
MR. MAY:

Mr. Justice BXaekmun, in answer to your

question, there are photographs which are a part of the
original record in this case, color photographs showing the
form in which the tires are,- in fact, delivered to the
importer's warehouse in Gwinnett County, Georgia.
Exhibits P 2, 3 and 4 to the record are those
photographs.
And, finally, I'd like to mention Starke versus
Wells, which Mr. Stevens mentioned is, as we read it, an
income tax case.

It was not a tax on imports and clearly is

not applicable here.
IJd like to conclude, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice,

31
by saying that when you carefully consider all of the
arguments raised by the tax officials, they would require,
the results sought would require a substantial revision of
the language of the import clause as well as the overruling
of the entire Brown versus Maryland line of decisions and we
respectfully submit to the Court that it has consistently
rejected all efforts to overrule Brown versus Maryland and
expressly refused to undertake revision of the import clause
in Richfield 0,1.1 in .1946 and for this reason we suggest that
these arguments should not be urged before this Court but
before the only branch of government which has the power to
consent to the state taxation of imports, which is the
Congress.
As the Court recognized in Hooven and Ellison,
Congress has the power to lay down its own test for determining
when immunity ends and unless and until that body sees fit
to do so, we respectfully urge the Court to continue to
follow the test which it has consistently applied for almost
150 years.

That test, in our judgment, is contained in the

Brown versus Maryland line of decisions.
Those decisions reflect what we believe are a
most thorough and careful consideration of what the framers
intended when they originally adopted the import clause and
we believe they are as sound today as they were when
originally written»

32

Accordingly, we respectfully urge, Mr. Chief
Justice, that such decisions be followed in this case and
the decision of the Georgia Court reversed.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:36 o'clock p.m,, the case;
was submitted.]
