MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Kerr Against the District Court of the
Northern District of California, Number 1023.
Mr. Mayor, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL S. MAYER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. MAYER:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the
Court:
I am Karl Mayer, Deputy Attorney General of the
State of California;.

I represent Petitioners in this action,

the Director '■‘f Corrections of the State of

California and

the chairman and members of the California Adult Authority,
which is the state parole board.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mayer, may I ask, did this case go

to trial on September 2!5?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

No, your Honor.
It did not.
There was a trial date.

It was

changed to November 10 and that has since been withdrawn and
there is at present no trial date.
QUESTION:

So this issue is still a live one?

had the impression, reading one of these briefs, that they
weren't after this, material any longer for the purposes of

I

4
the final hearing.
MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor,.

Counsel for the

Plaintiffs below had expressed to the Court, in a suggestion
of mootriess, their willingness to proceed with trial without
the documents.

At that time, there was a trial date of

September 25.
Now, there have been proceedings in the District
Court since then and on October 23, as I recall, there was a
scheduled pretrial conference before the District Court.
Three days before that, on October 20, the district
judge had sent a notice to tne Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, noticing the apparent necessity of a three-judge
court.
At the formal pre-trial conference on the 23rd —
as I recall the date — the topic of the three-judge court
was again broached and there was some discussion and the way
it was left was that the pending trial date of November 10
was withdrawn with further proceedings on the three-judge
court question now scheduled for November 20.
QUESTION:

The

three-judge court question is

what?
MR. MAYER:

As to the necessity of the three-judge

court for the trial below,
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

And that results from the amended

5
complaint that the Plaintiffs filed — the claim of the
three-judge court?
MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor, the amended complaint

was filed July 1 of this year,, 1975,

Our suggestion of the

necessity of a three-judge court was filed some two or three
weeks after that and that notice has been pending in the
District Court since, but not disposed of.
And then on October 20, the District Judge did
send the notice to the Ninth Circuit.
The three-judge court has not yet actually been
convened.

The notice of its necessity has gone to the

Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

If the three-judge court is convened

to deal with these issues, then is there any case for
decision here?
Xf the same district judge who tried it — this
was Judge Weigel, was it?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
clarify that?

Yes, your honor.
And he is the judge who, will you

Has he requested the designation of the three-

judge court now?
MR. MAYER:

This notice to the Ninth Circuit

reads that this case appears to be a case requiring a threejudge court — I am quoting it as best I can — "And I here­
by certify to you, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit it

6

as a case requiring the convening of three judges."
QUESTION:

If that three-judge court is designated,

will it be reasonable to assume that he will or ought to
vacate his judgment in this case?
MR. MAYER:

I believe that if the three-judge

court is actually convened and the three judges are appointed
and sit, that we as Defendants in the action below could renew
our motions before the three judges together for their
consideration and I believe that consideration could be de
novo and they could -— the three judges together could, in
effect, overrule the single judge, his earlier rulings.
QUESTION:

Would these rulings be outstanding

until they were overruled?
MR. MAYER;
QUESTION:

Or would they —

Yes, your Honor.
Or would they all be wiped out after

a three-judge court were named?
MR. MAYER:

I don't think the fact of convening

a three-judge court would eradicate the existing single
judge orders and certainly would not eradicate the Ninth
Circuit opinion.
QUESTION:

It would be the same case with the

same number and ev€irything except just now a three-judge?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor, a three-judge court.
Is that it?
Yes.

7
QUESTION:

Wall, would all the issues be auto­

matically referred to the three-judge district court or just
those which required the convening of the court in the first
instance?
MR. MAYER:

I believe that the entire case would

go to the three-judge court.
QUESTION:

Under the Plaintiff's complaint before

it was amended last summer, no one made any contention that
there was a need for a three-judge district court.
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.
Mr. Mayer?
Yes, your Honor.
I wish you would clarify for me the

status of the demand for these documents.

You have said and

the briefs state that Defendants below were willing to waive
their demand, for the documents.

Has that waiver been with­

drawn?
?4R„ MAYER:

Your Honor, the topic first came up

in proceedings in the District Court, I believe in July, and
at that time there was an oral statement in open court
by counself for Plaintiffs that they would — they have not
yet -- they would stipulate to withdrawal of their request
for the documents.
They have not, in fact, withdrawn their request
for documents and the District Court orders which compel

8
their production are outstanding, as is the published Ninth
Circuit opinion.
QUESTION:

They are stayed,, Mr. Mayer, are they

not, by Justice Douglas —
MR. MAYER:

They are saved by the order of this

Court, yas, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, that being so, I gather they'll

remain stayed until after this three™judge court issue is
determined, will they not?
And they remain stayed even if there is a threejudge court convened, I take it.
MR. MAYER:

Is that so?

But for the order of this Court

staying the District Court's orders, it is my understanding
that the orders would become automatically effective.

It

is not my understanding —
QUESTION:

Yon said earlier, or I thought I heard

you say that if the three-judge court is convened, then you
would be at liberty to renew the motions made before the
single judge and denied by him.
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

Yes, your Honor.
Well, now, what are those motions?

* •

Those are motions what — to do what — in respect to these
documents.
MR. MAYER:

our
Well, basically, these were/motions in

opposition to the motions to compel discovery.

I would

9
think until our motions are made, we would have to also ask
the three judges to stay the single judge4s order.

We asked,

we had to go to the Ninth Circuit to get stays on the judge's
orders.

He was not

willing to stay them on his own and I

wouldn't think there would be any different result if we
were asking the three judges to review the single judge's
.order.
QUESTION:

But we don't know that, of course.

MR. MAYER:

No, I don't, your Honor.

QUESTION:

I take it if — it was the state that

made the application to convene the three-judge court?
MR. MAYER;

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And if that were to be denied, I take

it the state may appeal to the Court of Appeals from that
denial.

May it?
MR. MAYER:

Your Honor, off the top of my head I

am not sure whether it would fee an appeal or a writ, a
petition for mandamus.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, yousd have to go

to the Ninth Circuit.
MR. MAYER:

We'd have to go to the Ninth Circuit.

QUESTION;

A denial would not be reviewable here.

MR. MAYER;
QUESTION:
already certified

Correct, your Honor.
But you indicated that Judge Weigel had
to the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit

10

as a three-judge ease»
MR. MAYER:

Isn't that correct?
That is correct, your Honor, except

that on November 20 there are further proceedings before
Judge Weigel upon his —

where he will reconsider his

notification and I believe he contemplates at that time
either withdrawing or not withdrawing the notification,
The three judges, as I say, have not yet actually
been appointed,
QUESTION:
MR, MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

But the judge aan still appoint it,,
Yes, your Honor.
Ke can appoint it today,
Yes, your Honor.
And then you make a motion and the

three judges agree with you and then what is before us?
You don't understand?
MR. MAYER:

No, I understand, your Honor.

guess a problem in my head’ is this.

I

If the question is

before this Court as to whether the other two judges of the
three-judge court would have jurisdiction to consider the
orders in the first instance.

In other words, this Court

has stayed the single-judge District Court’s order.
Now, as long as the case and those questions are
before this Court, I would feel it would be improper for the
other two judges and the single judge to also be considering
them.

11
QUESTIONS

Or in any event, they might well feel

that way.
MR, MAYER:

They might feel that way, yes, your

QUESTION:

Well, could we just maintain our stay

Honor.

until the three-judge court acts'?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

I would think if this Court —
We have already stayed it.

MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

It is now stayed.

Could we continue

to stay until the three-judge court acts?
MR. MAYER:

I would think if your Honors said this

in a minute order or something, then the three-judges would
feel, perhaps,

more free to do that.

QUESTION;

Wall, I suspect that one of the things

to be considered on the November 20th hearing is whether the
district judge had any jurisdiction and has any jurisdiction
over anything in this case, since it is pending here?
What authority has he got after this Court has
granted the writ here, to deal with the case at all except in
a purely ministerial way?
MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor, that is a question

that I am uncertain about.

The distinction is this, is that

the certiorari has been granted as to interlocutory discovery
orders and we have searched but have not found express

12
authority that would state that such certiorari granted to a
limited part of the case would also stay the entire pro­
ceedings below.
I think Judge Weigel believes that it is not
improper for him to consider these other matters.
QUESTION:

Well, I think perhaps

you had

better address yourself now to the main arguments now in
light of this expiration unless there are further questions
on this jurisdictional point.
MR. MAYER:

thank you, your Honor.

Petitioners come before the

Court very basically

because the District Court has granted indiscriminate demands
for documents.
Indeed, the demands are for entire categories of
documents.

ouT0 state ^overmueut documents and the

documents are of conceded confidentiality.
In doing this, the District Court did not look at
a single document' in question, although the Petitioners
offered to present them to the Court for that purpose, prior
to their disclosure directly to the adversary.
Also in doing this, the District Court * s order
of December 3, the order affecting the contents of inmate
files was not only precipitated without the judge having
seen the documents but is effectively a prospective order
which requires the Petitioners to produce the entire contents

13
of any inmate's file that is designated by Plaintiffs in the
future, up to a number of 200 files.
Some 20 to 30 files have been designated leaving
approximately 170 inmates whose names can be picked at will
by counsel for Plaintiffs,

They have not yet been picked*

When picked, under the District Court's order, we
must turn that entire inmate's file directly over to the
adversary.

We cannot withhold any document for any reason,
QUESTIONS

Now, what, briefly, does an inmate's

file contain or consist of?
MR, MAYER:

The inmate's file starts out with

basically certain documents from the committing court, the
trial court, the judgment of commitment, a probation report,
statements by the judge and the district attorney and defense
counsel as they exist,
QUESTION:

Public statements or private statements

made just for the purpose of that file?
■

MR, MAYER:

They are private statements for the

purpose of the file as to the judge and the district
attorney.

The statements of the defense counsel

it is up

to defense counsel if what he says is in the probation report.
The statement may also appear in other documents which may
or may not make it a public statement.

document.

But, basically, they

psychiatric work-ups.

He is examined by

He

he is given

Ha is tested for his ability to read

and some assessment is made of his mental, standing.
As he proceeds through the system, assignments to
other institutions are made and each of these steps is backed
up by papers in the file.
There is a copy of his background, in effect, a
rap sheet of his prior commitments and charges, the normal
rap sheet with which we «ire all familiar.
There are statements which are characterized as
pre-board reports, statements of a correctional counselor who
knows and is familiar with the inmate and it is basically a
report to the adult authority for consideration at the time
of parole consideration,.
There are these kinds of documents.
there are disciplinary matters.

Now, also, in

If the inmate violates a

When he

has his hearing, under the Wolff case , there is report of its
disposition, the people who were at the hearing.

constitutes a violation of prison rules, that informant*s

QUESTIONS
MR, MAYERS
QUESTION s

Mr, Mayer?
Yes# your Honor.
Is that file available to anybody out­

side of the institution normally?
MR. MAYER:

No.

Well, by outside the institution,

it is available to the Adult Authority# which is the Parole
Board.
QUESTION:

Sure# I understand that.

But nobody

else?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION;

Not normally.
Is that a statute or custom?

If you

know.
MR. MAYER:

It is by both.

There are situations where

The defense counsel can see it? if

counsel, the defense counsel has access to his client's
file and there are other circumstances.
QUESTION:

And I gather tills is the documentation

before the Parole Board when they are considering whether he
should be released on parole?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And at that juncture, at the Board's

hearing, the prisoner has no attorney, does he?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.
In other words, a determination would

be made by the parole board whether or not to release — in
part, at least — perhaps in some instances, entirely — upon
the contents of the prisoner's file.
MR. MAYER:

That is correct, your Honor.

However, the —

Adult Authority for the purpose of fixing the sentence?

Yes, first ~~
The judge does not sentence in

Is that correct?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.
Except in accordance with law and

then the Adult Authority makes the decision from that point
on.
MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor.

17
QUESTIONS

Is the file

then roughly comparable

to the file before a United States District Judge, for
example, in making a sentence after he has the

presentence

report?
MR, MAYER:

It is —* that kind of thing is much

more extensive because the information generated in a file
has been generated over a longer period of time.

Also* I am
district
not sure of all that is in a presentence file for a/judge,
but it would basically be that kind of file.
QUESTION:

It wouldn't have all the documents.

What is before the district judge would not have all the
prison documentation —
MR. MAYER;
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

Correct, your Honor*.
— would it?
That is correct.

Now, however, the xnmate, before ha goes into his
parole consideration hearing may himself look at the file and
there are extensive procedures for the inmate to, if he sees
something in the file that he feels is incorrect, to take
administrative procedures to correct it, there are procedures
within the Department of Corrections as well as within the
Adult Authority for the appointment of investigators.
QUESTION:

When the Board is fixing the sentence,

is this after a hearing at which the prisoner is present
before the Board?

18
MR. MAYER;
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.
And so at that time do the Board and

the prisoner together examine the contents of the file?
MR. MAYER;
contents.

They don't together examine the

They talk about the contents.
QUESTION:

So the prisoner is aware of everything

that is in the file.
MR. MAYER;

Except for the highly-confidential

items, your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. MAYER;
QUESTION;

That is right, yes.
Yes.
And that would be what?

Informant's —

confidential informant's statements?
MR. MAYER;
statements.

It would be confidential informant's

The file often includes information on the

crime partner of the particular inmate.
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER;

Oh, yes.
That information — there is a strong

policy of not letting on® inmate sea another initiate's
information.

That would be withheld.

That kind of thing.

Some psychiatric reports are not shown to the inmate because
the psychiatrist feels that it would not be good for him to
see his own psychiatric report.
Your Honor, X have wished to emphasize one very
basic point, I think, which ruras through our whole position

19 »20
here and that is this:

the state is not attempting to, in

effect, lock up these documents for good, that no one can
see them or that the court cannot see them.

We are asking for

a —■ only a reasonable and informed evaluation of them before
they must be turned over to the adversary.
QUESTION;

The —

I take it, Mr. Mayer, from part of

your brief, pages 64, 65 and 66 that one of your contentions
is that in weighing that type of an approach, the fact that
the state owns these documents and the state itself could not
be made a party to this action under the Eleventh Amendment,
that

itself is a factor which should be weighed against

extensive discovery.
MR. MAYER;

That is correct, your Honor.

If the documents arc, in fact, important to the
Plaintiff’s case,they should be disclosed.

If they are not

important to the Plaintiff’s case, in fact important to
Plaintiff’s case, they should not be disclosed.

And I

think that
QUESTION;

Well, all the Plaintiff wants is a

sampling, isn't it, one in every 20 or something like that?
MR. MAYER':

The Plaintiff's initially requested

ore of every 20 inmates filed.
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Okay.
The court's order ~
It is at random, I gather?

21
MR. MAYERS
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
200 files."

Yes, your Honor.
Yas.
Now, the court's order reads, "Any

However, of the -— any 200 inmates’ files, but

they get the entire file,

There is a sampling as to the

identity of the inmate, but as to the documents to be
produced, there is no sampling.

Everything goes.

Now, with the sense of probability as it is in
my

mind, a certainty that in an entire inmate's file there

is something in some inmate of the

200 inmates' files that

is highly confidential and that is not in any way relevant to
the civil rights action before the District Court.

That must

be a certainty and yet, the prospective terms of this order
require everything, without regard to the nature of its
confidentiality, must be turned over directly --- directly to
the adversary.
QUESTION:

There is no provision for an in camera

examination by the judge?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

There is none whatsoever, your Honor.
Was that suggested?
It was suggested and refused and,

indeed, with respect to the inmate files, the Petitioners
attempted — they couldn't look at any of the documents
until the inmates’ names were given.

When they were given,

certain documents were withdrawn from the files.

22
Everything else was given to counsel to look at.
Counsel found this unacceptable and made a motion for
enforcement

clarification and sanctions before the District

Court and when that was heard, the District Court made it
very clear that by withholding any documents from production
directly to counsel, it was viewed as bordering on contempt
and when the December 3 order subsequently came out it was
very clear in the court’s explicit language in there as to
what might be provided, that everything must go directly to
counsel.
QUESTION;
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Mayer?
Yes, your Honor.
Did the state ever give any concrete

reason why the documents should be regarded as confidential?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR, MAYER:

Yes, your Honor.
Other than generalities.
With respect to the documents in the

inmates* files, these — when the documents were withheld, as
to each inmate’s file there is a statement of confidentiality,
I belie\?e it is characterized as, and this appears

there

is a series of these appearing in the single Appendix at -beginning at page 502.
They are called "Confidential Case Records."
These are Department of Corrections documents and in these is
listed the documents withheld from each particular inmate’s

23
file that was, in fact, furnished and for example, if I may
refer the Court to the confidential case records statment
appearing on page 516 of the Appendix, it reads as
characterising or describing a document withheld, "Memo of
June 6, 1972 identified name of informant concerning escape
attempt..

Disclosure would jeopardise safety and

welfare of

informant."
Of course, below that is another document to
which I had made earlier reference, cumulative case summary
of crime partner, identifying him by name.
I can think of no clearer statement that would
put the court on notice that a document is of a confidential
nature and such documents, we feel, at least deserve —
before their compelled production, deserve an examination by
the Court.

The other half of that coin, of course, of our

position, is that the court can deny ■— it can deny in this
case a discovery without looking at the documents but could
not grant it without looking at the documents and the reason
for that is, is that the case in the District Court is not a
case of a single inmate attacking his parole consideration
procedure where he needs to know the documents considered at
that procedure.
The litigation below is a general litigation.
They are after these documents

the plaintiffs are after the

documents as examples, as something as a basis for

24
information for the Court that the Adult Authority,, the
Parole Board, relies on information which is not always
reliable.

They don't need every single document in 200

inmates files to advance that contention.
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Mayer?
Yes, your Honor.
I have before me the opinion of the

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the petition for certiox*ari
Appendix A at page 13.

Isd like to read one sentence, have

you follow me and then relate it to your argument.
The sentence is in the only full paragraph on
page -- it is Roman XIII, beginning — it is the last
sentence in that paragraph, "Since there may be information—"
Bo you have that?
MR.. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
"Since there may be information in the

requested documents which should he protected, the Petitioners
may assert a privilege to a particular document or class of
documents and perhaps seek in camera inspection at the time
the documents are discovered in the District Court."
I understood you to say that you were making no
blanket objection fco these documents, that the state would
be satisfied if the District Court examined each one of them
in camera before they were used in the trial.
Does that sentence meet

your objection?

And, if

25
not, why?
MR. MAYER;

It does not, your Honor.

I have

responded to that in our reply brief.
QUESTION;
MR. MAYER:

Yes.
In footnote 8.

And that response is

this, that sentence in the District Court's opinion, as
stated in the mandamus proceedings that relate to only the
personnel files and other confidential writings of the Adult
Authority;

at the same time the Court was considering this

opinion, it also had before it the mandamus petition, a
separate petition covering the inmate files and that two
of the judges that sat and decided suimarily to reject the
mandamus on the inmate files sat on this opinion that
covered this opinion that covered the inmate files.
Now, in the inmate files case whan we did take -and we did attempt to withhold a few documents, to which I
have just referred now, the confidential case records list of
documents from inmate files.
We have attempted to withhold them as a preliminary
matter as soon as those files were designated, our first
chance to withhold them.
We did it as a preliminary matter.

It precipi­

tated a motion by Plaintiffs informing the court that we
were violating the court's order.

When the matter was heard,

the District Court said, this is bordering on contempt and

26
the court's December 3 order makes very clear that what we
did was a violation of the District

Court’s order, by with­

holding temporarily any documents from provision directly to
counsel.

That order was before this panel of the Ninth

Circuit when it made this statement and yet resulted in a
summary denial of mandamus.
It was a more aggravated situation, indeed, than
the personnel file situation before the Court here.
The second problem is that it is not clear what
the Ninth Circuit, —* what the Court of Appeals envisions by
the phrase, "At the time the documents are discovered in the
District Court."
The District Court orders compel the furnishing
of the documents directly to counsel.

There is not a pro­

ceeding where documents are exchanged in open court.

They

are furnished directly to counsel and with the personnel files
we did ask -- we did ask in the. District Court for an in
camera inspection of the contents of them and the District
Court expressly said no, furnish them directly to counsel.
But we had already done that.

And for that

reason it is unclear to me what the Ninth Circuit envisions
in that

statement, but in any event, it certainly would not

apply to the inmate files, and the contents of the inmate
files.
QUESTION;

Well, X must say, Mr. Mayer, that is a

27
strange business,,

This certainly would indicate, on the

face of it, that the Court of Appeals thought that you had
the advantage both of the privilege and, in any event, to
seek in camera inspection.
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.
And was this before the District Judge,

after the decision of the Court of Appeals?
HR. MAYER;

No, your Honor.

The Court of Appeals

decision is January, 1975 and the District Court’s order on
the personnel files was June, 1974 and the order covering
the inmate fixes was August 12, *74 and December 3, *74.
QUESTION:

Has he modified his order any since

the Court of Appeals?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.
I don't understand that.
Indeed ~
He would have retained jurisdiction

to modify an order, wouldn't he?

Do you think?

That's a question.
MR. MAYER:

Well, your HOnor, there's a strange —

I don't say strange -- there is a — I will say strange.
There is a strange situation going on in this
case down there.

The Court of Appeals order for the personnel

files carae out in June of '74 and we promptly petitioned for
a mandamus in

the Court of Appeals.

28

QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:

Ycu mean the District Court’s order.
The District Court’s order is June '74
In the summer of 574.

Then you went to the Ninth Circuit asking for
mandamus.
MR. MAYER:
mandamus.

We went to the. Ninth Circuit for a

The Ninth Circuit ordered that an answer to our

petition be filed and indicated there ™- and stayed the
District Court's order on the personnel files.

That is

September — August and September, '74.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, Mr. Mayer, you could

have gone back to the Court of Appeals but you weren't
or back to the District Court, rather,
satisfied/with what the Court of Appeals gave you so you
petitioned here.

Is that it?

MR. MAYER:

That is not correct, your Honor.

had already been to the District
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

We

Court on that very question

After this?
No, your Honor.

If I might explain.

There were two mandamus petitions going on at the same time
before the same judges of the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

Is this the review of the mandamus

denial?
MR. MAYER:
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

Both are,
Beth are.

All right.

And both were denied, one with an

29

opinion, one without.

One is a summary denial.

The summary denial is the more aggravated
situation, inmate files -- the contents of inmate files was
summarily denied in December.
QUESTION5

And what appears here, you would suggest,

would not have applied to the inmate files but only to the
personnel files?
MR. MAYER:

Well, that is the other mandamus case,

the personnel file case.
QUESTION:

That is where this opinion was written

in that case, wasn't it?
MR. MAYER:

Yes, your Honor,

Now, at the same

time the same court had before it the inmate file case.
QUESTION:
MR. MAYER:

Right.
And summarily denied it, the more

aggravated case and for us to now go back and say —- our
petition for mandamus on the inmate file thing weighed about
five pounds, and everything was before the court and to then
go back and say, well, look at it all again when they have
just got done looking at. it

weeks before we thought would

not be appropriate.
I am sure my time has —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Well, we have not

charged you the time when we interrogated you about the
jurisdictional matters, Counsel.

30

MR. MAYER:

Thank you, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURC4ER:

You will gat a white

light at five minutes.
MR. MAYER:

Thank you.

Your Honor, under Rule 2SB, the scope of dis­
covery in the District Court is limited to matters which are
relevant and not privileged.

In this case both factors arose.

The relevance of the documents to the action is most tenuous,
speculative or conjectural and the question of privilege
could not have been resolved for the District Court without
having looked at any single document which it ordered to be
produced.
Now, the question of privilege under Rule 26B is
difficult.

The rule does not define what privilege is.

is no statute that defines what privilege is, the hope

There
for

it in the Evidence Code failed and precipitated a case-bycase analysis of it.
The Petitioner’s position is that everything —•
what privilege means is that it is not discoverable, nothing
more and nothing less.
Soma privileges are. absolute.

In other words, in

every case the interest in preserving confidentiality

will

supercede any demand for its disclosure and as far as I can
tell, this applies only to military or diplomatic secrets
but with just about everything else in the world, the

31
privilege depends on who wants it and why and under what
circumstances and it also depends on what it is and these
factors beg of a balancing, an informed balancing of the
competing interests involved,,
And that is all that the Petitioners have sought
below.
The documents — the confidentiality of the
documents is not contested, at least insofar as they are of
the confidential nature.
The relevance and need for the documents is hotly
contested and we ask that the, at the minimum, the matter be
sent back to the District Court so that the judge may either
deny the discovery altogether, which would please us
immensely, or, at the minimum, look at the documents before
compelling their disclosure to the adversary.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Bergesen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. E. BERGESEN, III, ES£.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BERGESEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to — I think I ought to begin with
these same jurisdictional matters but if your Honor would
indulge me, I would like to respond only to one point of my

32
opponent because it was discussed so extensively here right
at the end of his argument, and that is, we disagree
entirely with his reading of the effect of the Ninth Circuit'
opinion.
There were, indeed, two mandamus proceedings.
There was one which was summarily denied in
December of 1974 without opinion which did have to do with
the central files but then came January of 1975 and this
Court’s opinion, the full opinion, although it dealt with
other types of documents, of the Ninth Circuit.
Nov?, our position, quite simply, is that that is
the law of the circuit.

That is the law that the district

judge is now bound by with respect to whatever type of
documents.
QUESTION:

You mean that the outstanding orders

now require modification to conform with this opinion?
MR. BERGESEN:

Yes, your Honor, that if they v?ent

back to the District Court once the stays were vacated, then
the District Court would have to proceed in conformance with
QUESTION:

And that you would not be entitled to

anything as to which a privilege was determined.
MR. BERGESENs

The way I read the opinion,

Mr. Justice Brennan, they would be permitted to make the type
of showing

and that is what really is at stake here — the

type of showing that they ought to have made but didn't make

33

initially and which is the basis of the Ninth Circuit's
opinion.
QUESTION s

And all of which involves also an in

camera inspection of the documents.
MR. BERGESEN:

It may and that would depend upon

the showing that they have made.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. BERGESEN:

In other words, the Ninth Circuit

held that they didn't make the proper showing, either to,
you know, have the privilege sustained or to get in camera
that they had to make

a proper showing and they didn't

make it.
But we would say that the opinion binds because
the other mandamus was prior.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bergesen, do you think the

District Court had a right to consider your amended complaint
while the case was here?
MR. BERGESEN:

Yes, your Honor, it is our position

that what came here — what was stayed, of course, was just
the discovery orders and that only that part of the case
which applies to these discovery orders and our right to
these

documents is here.
QUESTION:

So that under your theory a three-judge

court could have been convened, could have heard this case
and decided it before now and then what would we be passing on?

34
MR. BERGESEN:

Yea, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is

ray position and I wonder if I could address myself to two
questions, the mootness and the three-judge court —• and I'll
take them in that order if it is all right.
We did make a suggestion in late July after cart
was granted here.

We did file a suggestion of mootness

because what happened, quite simply, was we were faced with
a very difficult decision, either to postpone this trial for
perhaps a year as it then appeared last summer and wait for
what happened here and the documents that we might or might
not get or

go -o trial and we opued for a number of reasons

finally to

go to trial and in order to not have this as a

reason for

delay below, as it has been used below, and not to

have to litigate

two cases in two courts with time and

expense, especially when we saw that nothing could be gained
hare, we did file a suggestion of mootness which this Court,
of course, put over until this hearing.
QUESTION;

Well, why, when you filed it,

Mr. Bergesen, didn't you go back to the District Court in
those circumstances and perhaps ask first for lifting the
stay for the purpose, to ask that the orders be rescinded,
if you no longer wanted the benefit of them?
MR. BERGESEN;

In retrospect, Justice Brennan,

maybe, we should have done that.
we were foolish, I guess.

We thought at the time --

We naively thought that the trial

36

MR, SERGESEM:

In the District Court — and this

is the whole burden of cur case -— they did not make, they
did not —
QUESTION:

Wall, I understand that, but what does

the state want?
MR, BERGESEN:

They apparently want to go back to

the District Court and not have to make the showing that the
Court of Appeals says they have tc make.

That is the only

thing I can figure out.
QUESTION:

They want us to hold that, just based

on. whatever claim they made in the District Court, it
initially was enough?
MR. BERGESEN;

That the District Court was

required without more to inspect all the documents in camera,
that they could go in and say, "Here they are, Judge.
Seiy they are confidential.

We

You have got to inspect them in

camera."
QUESTION:

Well, you have been back and forth in

the District Court ever since, this case has been here.

You

at no time have told the District Court what you are now
telling us about waiving this right.
MR. BERGESEN;
QUESTION;

And that is the s econd issue

Brought here?

MR. BERGESEN;
Sc.y right now.

Yes.

Yes, this is what I am going to

37
QUESTION;

I, for one* am interested in allowing

you to finish what you have to say about mootness,
MR. BERGESEN:
the District Court.

Here is what we have told

We have told them from time to time that

we want to go to trial.
the documents.

Right.

We are willing to go to trial without

We v/ill not allege on appeal error by not

having the documents and I believe it was on October 17th ■— I
was advised by telephone — we filed a certificate of
readiness when we

thought

when we did have a November 10

trial date, saying we relinquish our rights to the documents.
Now, if

this Court were to hold that that were an

irrevocable relinquishment, the certificate of readiness,
then it seems to me the case would, indeed, be moot.
QUESTION:
relinquish it?

What is the paper the way you said you

Where is that paper that you filed in the

District Court?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

I believe, Justice Marshall —

Well, it is not here.

MR. BERGESEN:

No, sir, it was filed by my co­

counsel and I am told by —
QUESTION:

Well, how can we hold something moot

on the basis of a piece of paper that is not here?
QUESTION:

Especially if you have now disowned it.

MR. BERGESEN:

Well, we are not asking you — I

am not asking you this morning to hold the case moot and I.

38

don’t think it is moot but 1 was trying to say, in all candor
it seems to me that the two operative considerations are
whether our statements in the district court, including the
certificate of readiness, is an irrevocable relinquishment,
which I don't think it is but which this Court might
rationally hold it is.
QUESTION:

Are you saying now that you withdraw

that ~ that you taka the position you may withdraw it in the
District Court?
MR. BERGESBN:
this reason.

I think so, Justice Powell, for

Two things have happened since then.

First of

all, we were going to go to a pretrial conference at which
the court would issue a pretrial order on October 23rd in
which I think it would have incorporated that certificate
into the order.
That never happened because a couple of days
before the judge certified it as a three-judge court matter.
So everything is up in limbo and although I don’t know, I
haven't researched the matter, I would suspect that that is
not

irrevocable.
QUESTION:

In other words, you insist on the

documents •.
MR. BERGESEN;

We would like to have the documents,

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

But not

39

MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION;

But not if it would delay —

But not at. the risk of delay and now

in addition to what you may or may not have ever filed in a
district court and apart from the question of whether you may
or may not withdraw that, you filed in this Court the
following statement, ‘’Respondents no longer seek any of the
documents which are the subject of this appeal."
MR. BERGESEN:

Is that in our suggestion of

mootnessj?
QUESTION:

I am reading from what you signed and

filed in this Court.
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And in our —

And if that is true even conditionally,

shouldn't we set aside or remand this case to the Court of
Appeals with directions fco have it set aside the District
Court’s order and let everything start from scratch in the
three-judge district court, which is now going to be
convened?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Well, our —

And then you will know whether or not

there is going to be delay or not going to be delay.

It

won't all be conditional.
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Well, that is not. our position.

We

I have read you what your position at

least was on August 1st of this year.

And you filed that and

40
you signed it.
QUESTION:

Well, actually,

MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Mr. Bergesen —

Yes.

— your name is on this document.

MR. BERGESEN:

Is this the — this is the July

suggestion of mootness.
QUESTION:

August 1st it was filed here.

QUESTION:

No, August 1.

MR. BERGESEN:
referring to the date.
about relinquishment.

It was filed August 1.

It was filed — I am just
I believe there are two statements

The first one, as the other side

pointed out in their opposition to mootness, says "We relin­
quish our right to these documents because we .are going to
trial.”
Your Honor, I would say it is fair from the face
of the document and it has always been our position -because we have always wanted the documents and we have
always been successful in every court below in our right to
the documents.

We have always made it clear that whatever

relinquishment there was, was done because we thought we
had an imminent trial date and —QUESTION:

Because or on condition that?

MR. BERGESEN:

No, because.

Because we thought

we did, Justice Brennan, and it turned out time and again —
usually at the urging of the defendants, the trial date kept

41
getting put off and put off and put off and now we just don't
have that.
QUESTION:

Well, 1 must say it is rare when a

Respondent makes a suggestion of mootness.

I think it is

rarer sj;ill when now he wants to disown it.
MR. 3ERGESEN:

It certainly is, Justice Blaokmun

and it puts me, I feel, you know, in an unusual position
and yet at the same time, this was an unusual situation
below requiring, really, to have to go to trial then and we
were ready and we are ready.

Our evidence is getting staler

by the day and the month and this type of case presents
peculiar problems with stale evidence and witnesses and
interviewing them and getting into thijiir files.
We had to say lest summer, we'll either wait a
year and wait on this decision here, or we'll go to trial
without the documents and I would submit
QUESTION;

that is an unusual

But you made the choice and you told

this Court you had mads that choice.
MR. BSRGESEN:
QUESTION;

So isn't that the end of it?

-MR. BERGESEN:
the time we filed

That's right.

I think if this Court had ruled at

our suggestion of mootness, when we urged

it, I think that would have and should have bean the end of
it but I think the intervening events over which we — you
know, for which we have not been responsible -- have changed

42
QUESTION:
time.

Wally what is that?

The passage of

Nobody is responsible for that,
MR» BERGESEN:

Not only the passage of time but

the vacation of a series of trial dates, the certification
of the case as a three-judge case, what looked like a firm
trial date when we filed that suggestion of mootness.
QUESTION:

But the intervention of the three-

judge court complicates and may delay this even further,
unless the slate is wiped clean, you present this in order
to know a vote of the three-judge court.
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Isn’t that fair to say?

MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Well —

No — could I address myself to —

I hope you will.

MR. BERGESEN:

■— the three-judge court thing.

Our position would be this.

It might be that the

judge will withdraw his certification because we think it is
incorrect and not a three-judge court case.
QUESTION:

He might.

MR. BERGESEN:
appoint it,

Or the Ninth Circuit will not

But even if there is a three-judge court

appointed, it would sit as a district court in the Ninth
Circuit and it would be bound by Kerr versus United States
District Court.
I think the question that hasn't come up yet is

43
whether -— or maybe it did

whether if this three-judge

court ruling is retroactive so the case is considered always
to have been a three-judge court case, then was the petition
for mandaraus which resulted in the opinion of the court below
properly taken to the Ninth Circuit

or ought it to have been

taken directly here?
And that, in turn, seems a. little clouded by the
recent case of M.T.M. versus Baxley, which indicates that
perhaps it was correctly taken to the Ninth Circuit, although
if this Court were to hold that it were not, perhaps a
further question would arise as to whether it is here pro­
perly anyway because this

Court could treat the cert

petition as the petition w@ ought, initially to have filed
here.
I don’t pretend to have the answers, but those
seem to be some of the —
QUESTION:

You don’t, and neither does anyone

else, Counsel.
QUESTION:

If we accept your outstanding invita­

tion, there won’t be any Court of Appeals opinion to bind
the three-judge court, will there?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, Mr. Chief Justice?

If we accept your outstanding

invitation proper to declare this case moot, does that not
vacate the Court of Appeals opinion and the three-judge court

44
would deal with this matter de novo.
MR. BERGESON:

Well, our — if that were correct,

I feel that I —
QUESTIONS

Well, isn't that correct?

When we

vacate a federal case as moot, we wipe out everything below.
MR. BERGESEN:

Oh, certainly, Mr. Justice Brennan.

That would get rid of the Court of

Appeals' opinion.
MR. BERGESEN;
QUESTION;

Oh, yes, it would, but I don't feel

And the District Court's order.

MR. BERGESEN;

Oh, yes, that would get rid of

everything and wa would have a clean slate but with the inter
vening events, I don't think that I can — I think with
respect to my obligation to my client —■ continue my request
for mootness.
I think that I have to say that the intervening •—
unless this Court holds that the previous events make it
moot, I no longer, as I stand before you today, urge —
QUESTION;

Well, if we don't hold you to it, to

your August 1 submission, then are you here defending the
judgment and supporting opinion of the Court of Appeals
from which the state has appealed?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION;

Yes, we are.

We are

If you are and we affirm, then, anyway,

this whole business has to go back to allow the state to

45
prove privilege or that there ought to be in camera
inspection.
MR. BERGESEN:

If this Court affirms on the

grounds given in the Court below's opinion, yes, that is
precisely —
QUESTION;

Well, that's what I said.

That is

why I asked you whether you were defending the judgment of
the Court of Appeals and its opinion.
MR. BERGESEN;
also arguing that this

Yes, but in the alternative we are
Court could properly affirm the

discovery orders of the District Court as being proper in and
of themselves, in which case —
QUESTION;

Well, if they did, I should think we

would have to set aside that sentence that Mr. Justice
Powell directed your attention to in the Court of Appeals'
opinion.
MR. BERGESEN;
1

QUESTION;

Oh, yes.

But you would then be asking for a

judgment that gives you more than you obtained in the Court

of Appeals.
MR. BERGESON:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

Without having cross-appealed.

MR. BERGESEN;

But I think, Justice White, we

would be entitled to it on the doctrine that this Court can
affirm the Court below on any count.

46
QUESTION;

You can affirm on any ground but you

can’t extend the rights of the Respondent that the Court of
Appeals gave him,

You can affirm what he got on any ground

but I don't think you can extend it.
MR. BERGESEN:

I see.

Well, I stand corrected

then.
QUESTION;

But you can say, I suppose, that while

the Ninth Circuit gave the state nothing, they denied the
petition for mandamus and that you are entitled to argue in
support of that denial on whatever basis you want to,
MR. BERGESEN;

Precisely.

Technically, we would

be claiming that the affirmance here would be of the denial
of the petition for mandamus and then the court could put
that affirmance on any ground it wanted and since we fully
briefed and argued in the Ninth Circuit the proposition that
the District Court orders were correct
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand both you and your

opponent — as I understand you — when the case went back
to the District Court, the District Court would foe bound by
the Ninth Circuit's opinion to commit the state to claim the
privilege.
MR, BERGESEN;

Yes, sir and if this Court affirms

on that ground, then they would.

If this Court were to

affirm the denial of mandamus on the ground the discovery
orders were correct —

47
QUESTION;

I know, but wouldn't you have more •—

if we affirmed here instead and said that the discovery
orders of the District Court were right initially, the state
has no privilege and can't claim a privilege, you'd be
getting more here than you got in the Court of Appeals,
MR. BERGESSN:
QUESTION:

But we didn't necessarily

Wouldn't you?

MR. BERGBSENs

Oh, yes.

QUESTION;

All right.

QUESTION;

Well, I don't see that you would.

QUESTION;

No, the dicta in the Court of Appeals

opinion — so they denied mandamus but made a few observations.
QUESTION:

What more can you ask?

What more total

vieotry could you have had in the Court of Appeals than a
denial of mandamus?
MR. BERGESSN:

Well, if if had been placed on

the ground of discovery -QUESTION;

Whatever ground, that was the judgment

of the court.
MR. BERGESSN;

Then we would have had a lot more

of the documents, your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, but you seem — it may be dictum,

You said that the

District Court would be bound to permit the state to claim a

or not?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Correct» yes.

Mr. Bergesen, bring me back to one

A request had been made for a three-judge court.

Now, normally, the chief judge acts promptly.
Do you and your opponent know whether Judge
Chambers has acted on this?
MR. BERGESEN:
Blackman.

No, I don't know, Mr. Justice

The last I knew, he had not.
QUESTION:

He had not»

MR. BERGESEN:

Indeed, we have argued to the judge

that that was not correctly certified and he is going to

MR. BERGESEN:

Wouldn’t he have the power,

Mr. Justice Marshall, to withdraw his certification if he
believed if was improvidently filed?
QUESTION:

I doubt it.

Not the way I read the

statute because as soon as he files it, the Chief Justice
moves on it.
MR. BERGESENs

Sometimes there is a long delay,

though, your Honor, between the certification and the action
and since it is jurisdictional I would think he would be
required to withdraw it if he were convinced that it were
filed in error.
QUESTION:

Have you seen a case that did that?

QUESTION;

When you make that statement, is this

routine in the Ninth Circuit, a long delay?
other circuits that I know about.
MR. BERGESEN:

It isn’t in some

It is overnight.

I don't know, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

I don't think it is overnight in the Ninth Circuit but I don’t
know what generally is the case.
QUESTION:

To fch© contrary, doesn't the statute

say promptly?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The chief judge shall promptly?

MR. BERGESEN:

But you see — right — Justice

Marshall, our position is that the Second Amendment —
QUESTION; Not with all deliberate speed but

50

promptly.
QUESTION:

When we filed our second amended

complaint, it is our position that nothing in that complaint
that was not in the original complaint required a threejudge court and that defendants seised upon the filing of a
second amended complaint to raise a three-judge court issue
which has no meriti, in our view and I will not speculate on
motives, but certainly the effect of that has been further
delay when we have continued to want to go to trial.
If it please the Court, perhaps I could make some
of my remarks which go to the merits of the, case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Ye.s, we have enlarged

your time to cover this but you *— as was suggested before,
needn't use all of it.
MR. BERGESEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Perhaps the bast way to go most quickly to the
heart of this case is to consider two somewhat separate
but absolutely interrelated matters.
First, there is the obligation of the trial judge
to make an informed determination in situations whereas here
a government agency claims the qualified privilege for

official information.
QUESTION;

Well, apart from the privilege of the

state, what about the privilege of these individual 200
prisoners not to have their files —

51
MR» BERGESEN:

Judge Weigel1 s protective order

expressly requires us to get their consent before we look at
their files.
QUESTION?

aren6t they?
MR, BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

They are among the class,

MR. BERGESEN:

But even though they are among the

class of plaintiffs, we still have to get their written
consent.

they are not all main plaintiffs, are they?
MR. BERGESENs
QUESTION:

Oh, no, your HOnor.

They are all plaintiffs in the class,

MR. BERGESEN:

Well, they are all members of

the plaintiff class.
QUESTION:

That's what I mean.

MR. BERGESEN:

Now here, of course, the defendant

claims that the district judge abdicated that obligation by
refusing to look at these documents in camera but secondly,
that the obligation of an agency resisting discovery to
submit a proper claim and to make a specific showing in
the district court, that those documents do# in fact, come
in within the governmental privilege.
Now, our position can be stated quite simply.

Of

52
course the district judge has the obligation to make an
informed, determination but as a practical matter he can make
that informed determination only if the party resisting
discovery, the government agency which has complete custody
of the documents, makes the type of detailed showing which
the cases require and which they did not even attempt in the
District Court.
And I'd like to note that the questions asked from
the bench to my opponent this morning were what the files
contained?

What sort of documents are they?

harm could come?
district

What sort of

Those are precisely the things that the

judge needed to know, precisely the facts that the

resisting party was obligated to give him and exactly the
detailed showing that the resisting parties here refused to
make.
In other words, the requirement that, a resisting
party make a strong showing the documents are privileged is
not a mere technical requirement*
QUESTION:

Article
This is the argument on 26-3, is it?

MR. BERGESEN:

Preraised on, I believe all of the

discovery rules, Justice Brennan, that put the burden on the
resisting party to show that there is, for example, a
privilege regardless of what device is used.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BERGESEN:

And moreover, we put these defendants

53
on notice right at the beginning of this case in our Rule 37
papers that they had to make a proper claim by the agency
head, that they had to make a specific showing, but this
they never did throughout the entire litigation in the
District Court.
For example, in the District Court, these
defendants failed in the first instance to give the judge
any idea of the dimension of the problem, how many documents
were involved, failed to submit a formal claim by the agency
heads after personal considerations setting forth agency
policy, failed to even Identify the specific documents
involved for the discovering party, or for the court, failed
to separate the documents into privileged and nonpriviieged
portions and then correlate their claim of privilege to both
portions„
Fifth, failed to spall out the specific harm which
would foe caused if these documents were produced subject to
the protective order which Judge Weigel carefully drew and
failed to show why the protective orders recommended by the
magistrate and adopted by the judge would not be affected and,
indeed, at one point between the time when the magistrate
recommended a protective order that would limit the inspection
of the documents to anyone in our office, the other side
suggested that it ought to be changed to be limited to two
counsel and two investigators and Judge Weigel entered an

54

order,to one investigator, excuse me, limiting it to two
counsel and two investigatorst
Therefore, the obvious irony as well as the
fundamental legal deficiency of defendant's claim here of
judicial abdication is that it was their refusal to follow
the law and provide the district judge with the information
he needed which created the situation about which they now
complain.
Now, at this point in the analysis, defendants
would disagree o

They x^ould say —■ they would point to their

persistent request in the District Court that the judge
inspect these documents in camera and their subsequent
insistence in the Court of Appeals and in this Court that his
refusal

to do so constituted an abdication of his responsi­

bility.
Now, to most people including some lawyers and
perhaps even some judges, an in camera inspection sounds like
a reasonable way to make an informed, equitable determination
of this type of dispute.
However, a moment's reflection will show that there
is at least threa serious problems inherent in any in camera
inspection, problems which the defendants in the District
Court didn't even acknowledge, much less attempt to cure.
And they are, first, it is a serious burden,
obviously,not only on the trial court but on the appellate

55

courts, to go throxjgh however many documents may be involved.
Secondly, by all but eliminating the adversary
process,, an in camera inspection greatly prejudices the
discovering party and, third, and thi3 is of crucial
importance in our view, in a "Rule 34 litigation situation,
unlike a Freedom of Information Act, the judge cannot know,
at the discovery stage, what documents or what portions of
what documents are relevant to the plaintiff's case because
he doesn't know such crucial things as what information
plaintiffs have and of the depositions, who the witnesses are
going to be, what they need to impeach the witnesses with
and so forth.
So after you look at it for awhile, you see that
it is a very difficult problem.
Now, it is for this reason that the lower federal
courts — especially the D. C. Circuit, which gets most of
these requests, in the case of Vaughn versus Rosen which we
cite in our brief and others is beginning to require, even
in the FOXA case, a detailed breakdown of the documents,
separating them out, showing which portions are privileged
and which are not, cross-referencing the claims of privileged
to those portions allegedly non-disclosable in the situation
and setting forth an evidentiary basis for this.
Now, clearly, if this happens, this is necessary in
order to decrease the burden on the court and in order to

56
give a maximumly fair chance to the discovering party.
And we would contend — and what we ask is that if
this Court reaches that issue ~ because, after all, all the
Court of Appeals said was, its limited, modest holding was
that these defendants had not made the proper showing in the
District Court

and, indeed, upon remand they still have

that opportunity.
If this Court affirms on that ground, it may or
may not discuss the requisites for an in camera inspection
and our request is that if this Court reaches that issue and
discusses in its opinion that question, that it gives concern
to the very real problems

of in camara inspection, not just

the general ones experienced by any Freedom of Information
Act plaintiff, but the additional much more difficult knotty
ones experienced by a litigant in a Rule 34 situation who is
seeking these documents.
QUESTION:

What about the privilege?

In camera

could protect the privilege, couldn’t it?
MR. BERGESEM:

It — well, the problem there,

Justice Marshall, is that the qualified governmental
privilege requires the district judge to balance the harm
that would come from disclosing these documents against the
need for the plaintiffs of the documents in the litigation.
QUESTION?

Well, suppose in the documents in

inmate A's case it points cut that he informed on inmate B.

57
I think somebody needs to protect inmate A.
QUESTION:

Right»

MR. BERGESEN:

I wouldn’t disagree with that at

all.
QUESTION:

Kaw could that be done, under your way?

MR. BERGESEN:

Well, wa would designate files.

They would look through the file and say, here are these
three documents.

Document number one is privileged and needs

to b\i protected from disclosure because it ha3 in it the name
of an inmate who informed on another inmate.
Now, if that were done, the plaintiff^ the
discovery party, might very well say, we have no interest in
that.

We don’t want co see that document.
QUESTION:

You sea --

But if you do w&nfc to see it, you

would see it.
MR. BERGESEN:
made a proper showing.

No, then if — then they would have
They would have carried their burden

and the district judge either would uphold the privilege or
look at the document in camera.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said you

want him to look at it in camera.
MR. BERGESEN:

didn’t

I misunderstood you.

No, our position, Justice Marshall,

is that of course there is a place for in camera inspection.
QUESTION:

All

MR. BERGESEN:

right.
But it is not for a resisting party

58

to say/'it is all privileged., we demand in camera inspection
and here are the documents„
more showing*

We are not going to give you any

We are not going to give you any more help*

We are not going to give the discovering party any more of a
chance to participate in the process."
And that is what we are objecting to, the failure
of the resisting party to make the proper showing which
would reduce the burden on the Court and make the adversary
process work.
Now, let me give you an example of what they might
have done because the other side makes much of it.
this morning

They have

and they make much of it in their reply brief.

Their position is that with these central files,
unlike other documents, they have no time *— they have no
time to look through and make a submission to the court.
But this is the chronology of events that had to
do with the central files and it is all in the record.

We,

in following the District Court's order saying that we had a
right to see these inmates central files, on September 27th
this is at Appendix page 529, we designated 28 files we
wanted to

„
Not until October 9th did we actually show up to

look at them.

During that time the other side made no motion

to go into court to say, here are the documents we think are
privileged and why, to make any showing whatsoever.

They

59

simply withheld from us.

They said, despite the court's

order, "You can’t look at them.'8
So we had to go bcick to the District Court again.
We filed a motion on October 21st at page 446 of the Appendix.
There were, a whole series.

They filed two

submissions in opposition and at no time made the type of
showing that they ought to have.
Indeed, as late as November 20th, they filed a
countermotion — this is Appendix at 590

trying to get the

judge once again to reconsider and say that these documents
were confidential and now this is almost two months after
we first designated the files and still, in all this time,
they haven't gone into the District Court and made the kind
of submissions ~ and made the kind of
respect

showing, even with

to these inmate's central files that they say

everything moved so rapidly on.
And, parenthetically, we wouldn’t object to a
procedure below of following the Ninth Circuit's opinion
whereby even with respect to the central files we will
designate them.

There is a time interlude.

They can come in

and make the proper showing.
The one thing that we won't buy and the one thing
that the Ninth Circuit wouldn't buy is just this blanket,
conclusory claim of privilege with no showing to he3.p the
court and no showing that makes the adversary process work

60

and permits an informed decision to be made by the judge
with respect to the qualified privilege for official infor­
mation as to whether the discovering party's need for the
documents in the litigation outweighs the harm that would
come from their disclosure.

'

Now, I am so unaccustomed, your Honors, to
terminating an argument before the time is up —
QUESTION:

Is the question of relevance open here

at all?
MR. BERGESEN:

I do not believe -— I would have to

look at the cart decision, I guess.

Certainly, they haven't

argued with any
QUESTION s

The Court of Appeals must have held that

they were relevant,,
MR. BERGESEN:

The magistrate#

the district judge

and the Court of Appeals, each one of them after a hearing
called these documents to be relevant to the subject matter of
this litigation.
QUESTION:

Why did you want the documents?

Is

there any one easy answer or are there lots of them?
MR. BERGESEN:

There are lots and lots of them and

I have even written them down just to -QUESTION:

Is that to pass upon the competence of

the state officials?
MR. BERGESEN:

It is not to pass upon their

51
competence, your Honor, so much as what, you have is a very
unique situation with the parole
QUESTION:

Well, is it to pass upon -- so the

Court could make some judgment as to how they have performed
their duties in the past?
MR. BERGESEN:

Not so much, as to determine what

due process safeguards must surround these hearings.
In this regard, let me invite your Honors’
attention to a very recent article by Justice -—
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, but can’t you just tell me

v/hy you wanted these documents?
MR. BERGESEN:

Which ones?

There are three sets,

your Honor,,
QUESTION:

All right, take the personnel file.

MR. BERGESEN:

Yes.

The personnel file — the

extreme, indeed, the unique power and discretion given to a
parole board is usually premi-ted upon the fact that these
individuals have tremendous expertise not possessed by you
and me and therefore due process safeguards really would be
out of place in these parole hearings.
QUESTION:

How about the Supreme Court of

California?

Would you think you were entitled to the biothe
graphical backgrounds of all/members in order to see whether
they were qualified to make the

they make?

more important judgments tha

62

MR. BSRGESEN:

No, your Honor and wa distinguish

in our brief the many, many distinctions between federal
courts and federal judges bound by rules they do not make,
bound by rules of evidence, required to proceed in open
court on the record with all parties represented by counsel
subject to judicial review.
QUESTION:

Well, what did you

want these records

for?
MR. BERGESEN:

We wanted to show two things.

First of ail, as Judge Friendly suggests in a
recent Law Review article, there may well be — or there
should be a connection between the impartiality of the
hearing officer and the due process safeguards that are
required.
We intend c© show through these files, among
other things, that many of these hearing representatives and
members are former correctional officials -- are former
police officials who even arrested some of the --Mr. Chief Justice, may I leave the record for just
a minute?

I think my opposing counsel did that.
MR. CHIEF «JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, I can!t tell

until I know what you are going to go out of the record for.
Ordinarily, you are confined to the record here.
MR. BERGESEN:

Well, let me make a hypothetical.

If we could show, Justice White, that a parole board member

S3
as a Los Angeles Police Captain arrested an inmate, was
punched in the nose by an inmate, later went on the Adult
Authority and sat on that inmate's case and told him, "You
ain't ever getting out of here as long as I am on the Board,"
I think this Court and any court would agree that maybe
certain due process safeguards 3ike, perhaps, a right to
disqualify for bias — which we ask in our complaint ■—
would be required.
Now, how do we make that kind of showing?
QUESTION:

Your argument would be you might show

%

from his personnel files that there is such a possibility or
probability of bias on the part of these parole board or these
authority members or hearing officers that there should be
some due process procedures that don't new exist.
MR. BERGESEN s

Precisely and our second amended

complaint also alleges that the indeterminate sentence is
unconstitutional, in part because we claim that the
assumptions always made about parole board members that they
can predict that based on the materials before them or the
prison programs that the prisoners tales part in, they can
predict who will recidivate

and who can't and we are going

to prove that they can't at trial — or we are going to try —and we believe that we can show that the expertise which is
often said to underlie
QUESTION;

You are going to have to go back and

64
go through

— you do a sampling job on their predictions

and try to draw some conclusions that they can't predict?
MR. BERGESEN:
QUESTION:

We might have expert witnesses —

Well, isn't that what you are going to

do?
MR. BERGESEN s
QUESTIONs

I beg —

That is what you are going to try to do.

MR. BERGESEN:

I am not sure I follow you. Justice
/

White, on the sampling —
QUESTIONS

Well, how are you going to prove that

they can't make predictions?
MR. BERGESEN:

Take individual cases?

In part, the files may well

represent — but let's take an example of a parole board
member who writes a denial.

Based upon X, Y or Z and based

upon this, he says, I predict that there will

be recidivism

and let's say that our expert witness comes on, our psychia­
tric witness, and says, that is absolutely invalid.

You

cannot predict by X, Y or Z recidivism or dangerousness.
If you did enough of that sort of thing, you see —
our problem below. Justice White, we purposely structured
this case so as that we would have to make a detailed,
painstaking, evidentiary showing that, among other things,
the assumption popularly and consistently held by many people
including the judiciary about parole boards are', in fact,
untrue and the only way we can do that is by making a

65

painstaking, day-by-day evidentiary showing in the teeth of
a lot of popular wisdom which,, in our opinion, is absolutely
untrue, which invalidates the parole board and the indetermin­
ate sentencing in California.
the
QUESTIONMr. Bergesen, if you were/chairman of
a committee or subcommittee of the California legislature
and outlining a program of action of how you were going to
proceed in order to persuade the legislature to abandon the
Adult Authority system, I would think the argument you made
would be entirely a valid one.

But you are asking a court

to undertake to evaluate the efficacy of the California
Adult Authority system for sentencing offenders.

That is

what it amounts to, isn't it?
MR. BERGESENi

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I would take

issue with the word "efficacy."

Qur intent is to show that

the procedures are so defective and so lacking in evidentiary
integrity that they must be surrounded, by greater due process
safeguards than are presently afforded, that the Fourteenth
Amendment requires that because as this Court has said time
and again, what due process is required in any situation
depends on the situation and we want to make an evidentiary
showing to show what this situation really is as opposed to
what .it is popularly assumed to be.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
have anything further, Mr. Mayer?

Very well.

Do you

You have -- we can allow

you about five minutes more.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KARL S. MAYER, ESQ.
MR. MAYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

1911 be very brief.
Counsel spoke of the necessity, under the District
Court9s orders, for there to be consent of the inmate whose
files are to be inspected end that is true.
However, as I have indicated, the files contain
documents from persons other than that inmate.
crime partner information.

They contain

They contain information from

informants against the inmate whose file is to be inspected.
That inmate9s consent is irrelevant as to those
other documents.

He cannot consent to the disclosure of

other documents which he hac not generated.
Now,

Counsel has stated here that we would have

no objection if, in the District Court, there was some
showing made of the confidentiality of the contents of the
inmates* files and if some particular document were withheld
to be shown to the Court and upon a proper showing.

We would

have no objection to that.
That is precisely what we did and precisely what
precipitated this Attorney's motion for enforcement
clarification and sanctions.

That is precisely what

67
precipitated Judge Weigel threatening me, in open court,
with contempt if I tried it again and that is precisely
what precipitated the strident iangue.ge of the District Court
in the December 3 order.
This was done and it was rejected.

It was

rejected by the Ninth Circuit in its denial of mandamus in
that separate mandamus proceeding.
Now, if we go back to the District Court as the
law presently stands, we are in the same relatively helpless
position.

The opinion in Kerr is not helpful.
It is a denial of mandamus and nothing more.
There is some dicta in the opinion but the dicta

adds nothing to the state of the law as it was at the time
these events began.
I feel, with respect to, particularly, the inmate
documents and with respect to the contents of the personnel
files, more must be required of the District Court.
The background and information in which Counsel
has expressed an interest has

been furnished in abundance

to Plaintiffs,the complete work background, the complete
educational backgrounds were furnished in response to
interrogatories with statements and documents.
Each member of the

Adult Authority has been

deposed at length by Plaintiffs.

The depositions focused on

two things, their backgrounds and their attitudes and the

68
procedures each individual follows at parole consideration
hearings — how did they get into the file, what they look at,
how they weigh this, how they weigh that.
They have this information to a f a re -• the a ™ we X1
and there is no excuse to have demanded everything in every
personnel file, everything in every inmate file and so on.
We submit that the District Court has not acted
reasonably with respect to these documents, again, the
confidential nature of which is conceded and has been
continuously below.
I'll submit, your Honors.
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:24 o’clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
