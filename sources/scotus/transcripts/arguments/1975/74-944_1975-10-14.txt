MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Pickering, I think you may proceed when yon are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. PICKERING, ESQ.„
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PICKERING:

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice.

May

it please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court
of Florida to review decisions of that court upholding a
$100*000 libel judgment against the petitioner* Time* Inc.* and
.rejecting Time's claims to the protection of the guarantees
of freedom of trie press and freedom of the speech under the
Constitution of the United States.
The article in suit is a short one, reporting the
facts of the divorce of the respondent, Mary Alice Firestone,
by her husband, Russell Firestone.

It appeared in the

"Milestones" section of Time Magazine, a section which is used
to record events in the lives of important people.
reads in its entirety as follows, and I quote:
/

Q

The article

"Divorced"—-

Where are you quoting from?

MR. PICKERING:

I am quoting, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

from pages 4 and 5 of our brief.

The article also is Plaintiff's

Exhibit 1 in the tan record at page 522.

I am quoting from my

4
brief:

'"Divorced .

By Russell A. Firestone,, Jr., 41, heir to

the tire fortune: Mary Alice Sullivan Firestone, 32, his third
wife; a onetime Palm Beach school teacher; on grounds of
extreme, cruelty and adultery; after six years of marriage, one
son; in West Palm Beach, Fla.

The 17-month intermittent trial

produced enough testimony of extra-marital adventures on both
sides, said the judge, ’to make Dr. Freud's hair curl.’"
That brief report-—
Q

Before you go on, Mr, Pickering, I noticed in

your brief you follow that with a reference to the Associated
Press dispatch that came apparently after the Time Magazine
was--at least in the sequence indicated.
MR. PICKERING:

No, Your Honor, I am coming to that.

The article published in Time Magazine was based on four items.
The first item on which it is based is the Associated Press
dispatch to which you refer, which is quoted in my brief.
Q

And you will deal with the difference in

language?
MR. PICKERING:

I will deal with those right now,

Your Honor.
Q

Do you concede that the article was inaccurate?

MR. PICKERING:
Q

No, I do not, sir.

You think that her husband was granted a divorce

on grounds of adultery?
MR. PICKERING:

From the language of the decree

5

itself, which 1 will come to.

That is one of our six points#

that this was a truthful report of a judicial decision
such is protected under Cox Broadcasting, Your Honor.

and as
That is

not essential to our position? it is one of six points, any on®
of which we say we prevail bn.

But it is one, and I do not

concede that it is inaccurate, and I will come to that in due
course.
Let me say why it is not inaccurate or set the stage
as to why it is net inaccurate by stating that this dispatch,
this item, was based on an Associated Press dispatch, which the
Chief Justice referred to, an article in the New York Daily
News, and two dispatches from Time's Miami office.

The

Firestone divorce decree was handed down in the late afternoon
of a Friday, December 15, 1967 in Palm Beach County, Florida.
Within two hours after that, Time received this
Associated Press dispatch in its New York office.

That

dispatch stated that Russel Firestone had been granted a
divorce from the respondent here, whom he had accused of
extreme cruelty and adultery; and the dispatch also descrahed
the judge's statement about some of the testimony of extra­
marital affairs being of a nature which would make Dr. Freud's
hair curl.
Q

Right there, Mr. Pickering, do you say the

Associated Press dispatch tells the reader the same thing
that the Time Magasine—

6

MR. PICKERING:
me come onto that»

Ko, it is not» Your Honor»

And 1st

The New York Daily News article was the

next in the progression.

That was received in the early

evening of Friday, December 15th by Time, and that item is
Defendant’s Exhibit 3 in the record at page 545.

That item

reported also that Russell had been granted a divorce from his
wife.

That said simply that he had accused her of adultery,

no reference to any extreme cruelty.
adultery.

It said accused of

And it again referred to the testimony about extra­

marital affairs.
At that point, Time decided to run a piece on this,
and it sent a query to its Miami bureau asking for further
details, including the grounds for the divorce in the word-- of
the j udge.
Two responses were received to that query.

The first

cam© from the head of Time's Miami bureau, Mr. Duncan, giving
some of the details requested and stating that others would
follow.

That was received Saturday morning, December 16th,
The second dispatch, received in response to that

query, was from a Palm Beach stringer for Time, one Delaney.
That dispatch received in early afternoon of Saturday,
December 16th, said—that is Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 in the
record.
that

the technical grounds of

That stated

divorce, according to Joseph

Farish, the attorney for the respondent, Mrs. Firestone—and

7
here I quote—"were given as extreme cruelty end adultery."
So, Time then had from its stringer a statement from
the attorney of Mrs. Firestone what the grounds of divorce were.
With those four items, the AP dispatch, the New York
Daily News article, and the two responses to its query to its
Miami bureau—
Q

Did Time ever' ask for the court record?

MR. PICKERING:

Time did not have at that point,

Your Honor—
Q

So, it did not ask for it?

MR. PICKERING:
Q

Subsequently, subsequently.

I do not. understand why the Tim® contacts dovfr.

there did not go look for it when you asked for it.

there was no actual malice on its part, that it followed a
careful editorial process and took
Q

reasonable precautions.

What was the source of Mr. Duncan's quote of the

judge?
MR. PICKERINGs
Q

What?

What was the source of Mr. Duncan's quote of the

judge?
MR. PICKERING;

The divorce decree itself as--

8
Q

No, no.

I ara looking at the bottom of page 5—

MR. PICKERING:
Q

Knott commented.

".. .Judge James Knott commented “—and then you

have an. inner quotes.
MR. PICKERING:
Q

Right.

Where did Mr. Duncan get that quote from?

MR. PICKERING:

That came from, I believe, fcha

Associated Press dispatch, arid it is an exact quote from the
language of the divorce decree itself, which is Plaintiff's
Exhibit 2, and appears in the record at page 523.
Q

You have told us already that Mr. Duncan had not

seen the divorce decree itself.
MR. PICKERING:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

So, my brother Brennan's question is. Where did

Mr» Duncan get this quote?
MR. PICKERING:

That quote, as far as I know, as far

as the record shows, came from the Associated Press dispatch.
Q

In other words, he did not do anything in

Florida for Time that Time could not have done just reading the
AP ticker in New York? is that right?
MR. PICKERING:

That is correct.

Now, Delaney# the

stringer, did contact Judge Knott, the divorce judg©.

He

contacted him late Saturday afternoon and verified a couple of
quotes which they had had from the divorce decree.

But the

testimony was that he did not ask, nor did the judg© tell him,

9
what the grounds for divorce had been,
and, we submit, properly so,
Q

The record does not establish--

After this lawsuit was filed, was it not?

MR. PICKERING;
Q

He had it from Mr. Parish.

When did Time Magazine first see the decree?

MR. PICKERING2
Q

Delaney was satisfied

What?

After the lawsuit was filed?

MR. PICKERING:

I think that is correct, Your Honor,

although X cannot be categorically certain.
and I think that is all the record shows.

It was some time,
It was some time

after the article, long after the article perhaps, that they
got a copy.
Q

Would not a normal cautious editor ask a normal

cautious reporter or stringer that "1 want the inside informa­
tion on a court decree*5?

Would not both of them assume that

somebody would go to the—guess what—court to see it?
not ‘that be normal?
MR. PICKERING:
check with the attorneys.

Would

$
No, I do not think it is.

You can

You have the attorney for one of the

parties saying what the technical grounds were.

You have the

AP dispatch which stated that a divorce had been granted, that
the wife had been accused on two grounds, extreme cruelty and
adultery; and you had a wire coming from the stringer saying
that the attorney said thus and so much.
Let me try to say that there should not be a rule that

10
makes a difference in Constitutional liability, depending on
whether or not you have seen a copy of an opinion if in fact
you have reported that opinion correctly»
Q

You started out earlier and now you are at the

point where you were going to explain why the Time Magazine
article was accurate, an accurate reflection of the court
decree.

And you say in your brief that the judge actually

found adultery.
MR» PICKERINGs

What I say is that that is a reasonable,

that is an accurate—fairly and accurately reports what the
divorce decree says.
Q

If you are right, it really does not make much

difference where you got the information.
MR. PICKERING:
Q

If it is accurate, I suppose.

MR. PICKERING:
Q

Exactly.

Exactly.

Give me the decree and tell me. where there is a

finding of adultery.
MR. PICKERING:

In the first place, the article does

not say, Mr. Justice, that she wa3 found guilty of adultery.
This may be semantics but I think it is important to be
absolutely precise.

The article itself says that she was

divorced on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.
Q

How does an ordinary reader read that?

MR. PICKERING:

What?

11
Q

Dose an ordinary reader read it any other way

than that is what the decree says?
MR. PICKERING;
Q

No, I say it is & matter of semantics.

Certainly that is what your stringer said.

MR. PICKERING;

The stringer

said the technical

grounds for divorce.
Q

Were adultery.

MR. PICKERING;
Q

That is correct.

All right, then that is what you had; that is

what was reported to you.
MR. PICKERING;
Q

Let us look at the final judgment.

So, let me ask you, you say your stringer was

correct too then?
MR. PICKERING;
Q

Yes.

Mr. Pickering, before you go on, what was the

relationship between the stringer and Time?
MR. PICKERING;

The stringer is—-it is the usual

stringer relationship, Your Honor, of someone, who was available
to do work on an hourly basis.
Q

He was paid on a piecework basis?

MR. PICKERING;

Paid on a piecework basis.

He was not

an official part of the Time organization but. had been used as
a stringer for various items.

He had been in the Palm Beach area

and, therefore, he checked this out.
Q

Does the record show his employment background,

12
what he did regularly for a living?
MR. PICKERING:
Q

Yes»

MR. PICKERING:

It is set forth.

reporter in the Palm Beach area.

He had been a

He had been a. newsbroadcaster

And his present job at that time was as a news commentator ana
this part time.

But he had been in journalism of one sort and

another for over 20 years, Your Honor.
Q

Where is this?

MR. PICKERING:

That appears at—beginning in the

record at page 346.
Q

Does the record show whether he read the Miami

Herald of December 16th in which the article itself says,
quote:

"The judge added that he discounted much of the

testimony in the case as unreliable"?
MR. PICKERING:
shows that.

The

No? the record, I do not believe*

Associated Press dispatch,, hi eh was the thing

that triggered the Time interest in' that, also contained that
same statement about being discounted.
But let me say why this was the final report of what
the judicial decree said.

Page

523 of the record is where the

final judgment of the divorce decree begins.

In the first para

graph it says--and I will skip the immaterial parts--"The cause
came on for final hearing before the court upon the wife’s
second amended complaint...the defendant husband’s

answer and

13
counterclaim for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty and
adultery...."
So, the husband counterclaimed for divorce on grounds
of extreme cruelty and adultery.

The decree goes on, at the

bottom of page 523, to refer to certain testimony about the
extra-marital escapades of tha plaintiff of such a nature as
would make Dr. Freud's hair curl, states that the court is
inclined to discount much of this as unreliable.

Nevertheless,

it is the conclusion and finding that neither party is
domes ticated.
Q

What does that mean?

MR. PICKERINGs

That illustrates the difficulty,

Your Honor—*
Q

Does that mean she is guilty of adultery?

Is that a finding, that she is guilty of adultery?
MR. PICKERING:
Q

Not clear, not clear.

Not cleai"?

MR. PICKERING:

At that manent exactly.

We would say

that lack of domestication in the circumstances of this case­
in the first place, it was not a ground for divorce, statutory
ground for divorce in Florida at the time.
It recites the counterclaim on grounds of extreme
cruelty and adultery—
Q

They go on and define, I gather, domestication

from Chestnut v. Chestnut, “When the bride and groom are both

14
devoid of a yen for domestication, the marital bark puts out to
sea with its jib pointed to the rocks,"
MR. PICKERING:
Q

[Laughter]

But the final—

I still want to know, Mr. Pickering, are you

suggesting there is anything in that which imports a finding
that—MR. PICKERING:

No, I am not suggesting that

necessarily comes from lack of domestication.

I say what it

comes from then is page 528, Mr. Justice Brennan, where the
judge says:
"1.

"Ordered and adjudged as follows:
The the equities in this cause are with the

defendant; that defendant’s counterclaim for divorce be, and
the same is hereby granted...."
What was the counterclaim for?

It was for a divorce

on the grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.
Q

Pontifically in a pleading you may seek a form

of relief and urge ten different reasons for it, and the fact
that the court grants your prayer does not mean that it is
affirming all ten grounds that you sought it on.
MR. PICKERING:

When the language is this clear, as

the Florida District Court of Appeal found, it said that Time
carefully, fairly and accurately reported the final decree.
Q

The Supreme Court of Florida found otherwise.

So, you may prove to us as a
thing was accurate.

Constitutional fact that the

But surely you cannot rely on the language

15
of an inferior Florida court to supersede the language of the
Supreme Court of Florida.
MR. PICKERING;

I am saying that is much closer to

the mark, Your Honor, than the Supreme

Court of Florida? and,

in any event, it is this Court's function to decide that issue
as a Constitutional matter.
Q

Which is what we are trying to get at. right now

in asking you questions and hoping to get answers from you.
MR. PICKERING: Yes.
Q

Can you tell me, Mr. Pickering, is alimony

awardable to a defendant divorced on grounds of adultery in
Florida?
MR. PICKERING:

It is my understanding-—and again

I am not an expert, in Florida law—-it is my understanding that
alimony is not. award able and that alimony was of course awarded
in this case.

Lack of domestication also.

Suppose Time had

printed that the divorce was granted on grounds of lack of
domestication—
Q

You probably would not be here then, would you?

MR. PICKERING:

Well, I do not know.

The lack of

domestication may be a defamatory statement too, spanking as it
does with this testimony and
Q

so on of unmarital—

At least you could say the decree said that, and

it does not say what Time said it said.
MR, PICKERING:

I must submit, Mr. Justice, that I

16
think it affords a basis for saying precisely that because it
said the counterclaim was granted.
truthful report,

We say that it was a

We also say that at the worst it is a rational

interpretation of an ambiguous document.
Q

What would the judge say if he did not find

adultery but he found cruelty, extreme cruelty, and then n@
got down to saying, "I am going to grant the divorce"?
MR. PICKERING;

He could have said, "I will grant it

on grounds" —
Q

He would say, "I would grant it on the counter­

claim. "
MR. PICKERING;

I think it is perfectly open to

responsible reportingj the complexities of reporting judicial
decisions-—members of this Court well know what the problems
are that the press faces in matters of legal reporting, and
again I return to the decision of the Florida intermediate
Court of Appeals which I think put the nub of what w@ are
wrestling with, saying that if the press were charged with
directly analysing the legal intricacies of each news item,
their pages would remain empty of substance.
I say that Time did correctly analyse the divorce
decree on the basis of what they had.
I further say that Time was not guilty of fault or
negligence, and that liability has been imposed here without
fault.

17
Q

In that respect, Mr» Pickering, was this jury

instructed?
MR. PICKERING:
Q

Only on what?

MR. PICKERING:
issue of truth.
Q

Only on truth, Your Hcnor.

All that went to the jury was the

The instructions appear at 585.
So that there is no instruction to this jury

on the issue of fault?
MR. PICKERING:
correct.

On the issue of fault, that is

Also it went to the jury with instructions that if

they found Tim® was guilty of malic®, they could impose
punitive damages.

They awarded compensatory damages but

refused to find punitive damages.
Q

Is it your position that if there is a lack in

this record of an instruction on fault, that you are entitled
to a new trial?
MR. PICKERING:

No.

Our position is, Your Honor,

as a matter of law that the malice standard should apply here
and also alternatively all of these are alternative arguments.
Let me just outline very briefly what our legal points are.
Q

I am speaking of the Gerts case, which came

along afterward.
MR. PICKERING;
Q

Yes.

Have you abandoned any position that you are

protected in part by the thesis of Garbs?

18

MR. PICKERINGs
Q

By the which?

By the thesis of Gertz?

Yes.

MR. PICKERING:

No.

We take the position that liability

was imposed without fault, for three reasons.

One, that Time

truthfully reported, and we are protected by Cox Broadcasting.
Second, that there was no error or fault.

Nothing was found

below, no fault of any kind, that was not submitted on
negligence.

The Florida Supreme Court characterisation of the

article as an example of journalistic negligence rested simply
on its statement that Mrs. Firestone was not divorced on grounds
of adultery.
Q

What I am trying to get at is whether you feel

you were entitled to an Instruction on fault.
MR, PICKERING:

We submit that the editorial process

disclosed by this record,discussed in our brief and commented on
by the District Court of Appeal precludes finding Time liable
as a matter of law in this case.

W@ have our fault arguments,

the last of which is that this was a rational interpretation of
an ambiguous document. The ambiguities that are in it have
already been pointed out, the lack of domestication, what the
grounds were, and the simple granting of the counterclaim.

Those

are our three under no—the lack of any fault.
Q

Then you are not urging an instruction of the

kind to which I referred?
MR. PICKERING:

If we would have to have a trial, yes.

19

We raised all of this.
Q

This is what I am trying to get at, is whether

you take this at least now as a secondary position.
MR. PICKERING:

Yes, I would take that as a secondary

position, Your Honor.
Q

You might lose your primary one.

MR. PICKERING:

Exactly.

And I have three

primary ones before I am driven bade to that.
Q

Before you get t© those, let me ask you a

question about your response to Mr. Justices Blackmun.

Is there

any reason why, as a matter of federal Constitutional law
Florida cannot provide for fact finding on the issue, of
negligence by its appellate court rather than having to submit
it all to a jury?
MR. PICKERING:

No, as long as they properly decide

as a matter of law whether there was or was not negligence.
Q

So, if there

is sufficient evidence in t.M<*

record to support a finding of negligence by someone, then the
finding of the Supreme Court of Florida is adequate for a
Constitutional test.
MR. PICKERING:

Subject, of course

to the independent

review of this Court.
Q
Q
Mr. Pickering?

Certainly.
I think you go beyond that, do you not,
You say in any event the negligence or

20
carelessness standard is not the proper one, that she is a
public figure end therefore the standard that had to be applied
was the Hew York Times —
MR. PICKERING;
Q

Yes„

And we say that—-

That is your—

MR. PICKERING;

Yes.

That is our additional one.

We first say there was no fault, for three reasons, which X have
touched on.

We also say

that—in other words, as I have said,

there was no finding of negligence below except for the Supreme
Court of Florida; i.t was not submitted to the jury on any
negligence theory.
We say that in addition t© negligence, an actual
malice standard should apply for three reasons.
a report of a judicial proceeding.

On®, this is

Our starting point for all

of this is the long recognition that this Court has given to
the important function of the press in reporting on puoiic
procedures in the judicial forum and the need to be protected in
order to perform that function.

And if in reporting a matter

of this kind we do not come within the truthful protection of
Cox Broadcasting, we say that there should—-and here we would
rely most strongly on Mr. Justice White's concurring views in
the Metromedia case---that the actual malice standard should apply
to reports of public proceedings.
We say, and that is particularly true in the case of
the litigants themselves in that proceeding, that -they can be

21
decided to be public: figures for the purpose of the Mew York
Times—
Q

What is it that makes Mrs» Firestone a public

figure in the Mew York Times sense?
MR. PICKERINGS
Q

Two things —

Other than the journalism profession itself

made her such.
MR. PICKERING;

She began this litigation.

It was a

sensational piece of divorce proceeding that spanned almos'two years, received nationwide notoriety.

Mr. Firestone was a

very prominent wealthy individual—
Q

She received nationwide notoriety because the

media itself gave her that notoriety.
MR. PICKERING;

That is correct.

But how does one

become a public figure other than coming to the attention of
the press in some way?
Q

Oh, by becoming President of the United States

or a United States Senator maybe.
MR. PICKERING;
Your Honor, yes.

Then he becomes a public official,

But the Gertz test, we submit, is satisfied

here for determining who is a public figure.
It received national publicity.

She started this.

And we say that, a rule to

protect the press is required here where the—in order to
report on judicial proceedings, and we think it. is a nice
narrow, manageable—it is not the broad public—

22
Q

I guess she is not a public figure in the sense

that General Walker was.
MR. PICKERING:

That is correct.

She is not for all

purposes.
Q

And she is not in the sense--what was his name,

Rosen—the Metromedia case?

He was enmeshed in a police

campaign.
MR. PICKERING;

But she is a public figure, Your

Honor,
Q

But only because—only e I gather from what you

hav© said—only because this was a sensations.! divorce
involving people of wealth.
MR. PICKERINGs

Considerable social prominence and

wealth.
Q

Was she a public figure before she brought the

lawsuit?
MR. PICKERING;

Yes.

She was a prominent of member of

Palm Beach society as a wife of Russell Firestone.
Q

A public figure in the sense that it has been used

in opinions of this Court?
MR. PICKERING;

Not for all purposes and for all things.

We d© not hav© to go that far, Mr. Chief Justice.

We say that

she is a public figure in the purposes and for the context of
this case, and that there is a concurrence of the interest in
protecting the press and reporting on judicial proceedings so

23
far as the litigants themselves are concerned.

Q

I wonder if this is not key to whether or not

you succeed or fail, because if she is not a public figure, if
indeed she is a private person in the sense of Gerfcz—*
MR. PICKERING:
Q

—“then—

MR. PICKERING:
Q

In the sense of Gerfcz—

—then the negligence would apply.

Then the Supreme Court of Florida had the option

to adopt the Times malice test under Gerfcz or the

negligence,

and they have apparently adopted negligence.
MR. PICKERING:
Q

That is correct.

And then all that is left of your case is whether

or not we agree with you.
MR. PICKERING:

We agree that we

negligent,

that is correct. Your Honor.
There is one additional malice point, however, and
that, is that Mrs. Firestone was allowed to waive at the eve
of trial, withdraw her claim for damage to reputation.

We say

that, really should have, ba.en the end of the libel case at that
time, and we so urge.

We rely here on the Gerfcz case itself

for saying that there must be proof of actual damage.

The protected interest is

And having withdrawn that claim, she should

not be allowed to press, and that the actual malice—rather
that the actual malice test should then apply because you

of the party»

ingredient of injury, the scale we say should come down on the

that came from him, we submit that Time was entitled to rely on
that Stringer, despite the fact that there may have been a
conflict between the attorney and the stringer at trial over
who said what to whom.

We say that Time was just as entitled

to rely on that stringer as the Associated Press was to rely on
its reporter who Major General Walker had disputed, but this
Court found for the Associated Press in the Walker case.
Q
no malice»

In the Walker case the Court found that there was
Here you would be using the same finding to urge a

conclusion that there was no negligence.
MR. PICKERING:

Yes, but. it seems to m@ it is a

25
Constitutional standard in either event.
Q

Yes, but it

is not the same standard surely.

Less evidence will support a finding of negligence than would
support a finding of malice.
MR. PICKERING:

Certainly, Your Honor, and I say if

we can establish malice, lack of actual malice, we should be
home free under on© branch of our argument.

We also submit

that the evidence is not sufficient to find negligence here.
Q

Mr. Pickering, could I ask you one more quescran.

Let us assume that your stringer or your office down there was
admittedly deficient or negligent,

hr® you responsible?

Would

Time be responsible?
MR. PICKERING:
Q

No.

Let us assume the stringer sent in and said,

"I have read the deer©© and it said so and so," and as a matter
of fact that is just false, and Time nevertheless reported, in
its magazine exactly what the stringer said.
MR. PICKERING:

No, the stringer had nothing—the

persons responsible for that article, Mr. Justice, those who
are in the editorial process, are the people back in New York,
the writer, the researcher, and the editor.

And the knowledge

of that stringer is not imputable to those persons.
Q

Or to Time Magazine?

MR. PICKERING:

Or to Tim® Magazine1., and here I rely

on the situation of the photographer in Cantrell v. Forest City

26
Publishing.
Q

But you do not make that argument here because—

MR. PICKERING;
Q

Y®s, I do.

But the argument nevertheless is that you knew

what the stringer was relying on, and you should have relied on
something more.
MR. PICKERING;

No.

Our argument on that point—and

it is spelled out in the reply brief quite fully—our argument
is that we are relying on the report: of fch© stringer.

We were

entitled to and we did, and that that cannot be malice and it
certainly cannot, be negligence either, in our view, and it is
not imputed back to the people—
Q

You are saying you make the Walker type of

argument.
MR. PICKERINGS
Q

Exactly.

Exactly.

On that theory a publisher is never liable for

th© negligence of his servants then.
MR. PICKERING;

Until that has come home to the

people responsible for it, if they knew of a conflict, Your
Honor, and so on? or if the person were a notorious—there is
nothing in this record to indicate that they had
to rely on this stringer.

the respondent's attorney.
Q

Is it reasonable to believe that the stringer had

pointed out that the judge said the testimony on these subjects
was unreliable?
MR. PICKERING:
it as unreliable.

He was inclined to discount much of

He did not say he was discounting it all.

And that is another reason why we were not negligent,
Q

Does that not put a reader on notice that he had

felt was

MR, PICKERING:

He called up the attorney for the

offended party.
Q

There is a dispute about what the attorney said,

is there not?
MR. PICKERING:

That is correct.

But that was not

when they wrote the piece.

Mr. Pickering, is there anything in the record

about the relationship of this particular stringer?

MR. PICKERING:

Yes--well, no.

He was simply the

He was available to be called

upon to do work for Time—
Q

And he was in a sufficient position to let Time

MR. PICKERING:

I am sorry, I did not hear.

And therefore Time is excused because of a man

that—

MR. PICKERING2

I would take the same position, Your

Honor, if it were the head of the Miami Bureau, as long as there
was nothing to put Time8s office back in New York on notice that
something was wrong with that.
Q

How long had he been a stringer?

I mean, what

makes him so reliable?
MR. PICKERING:
of years.

He had been in news work for a number

His testimony appears beginning at page 346.

He

says, "A stringer is usually someone who is employed full time
elsewhere and works in a part time capacity for Time magazine."
He says, "I worked part time.”

Not on any guaranteed salary?
NO.

Then his entire background is gone into.
Q

Is he as reliable as a staff man of Time or not?

MR. PICKERING:

Until something comes to the attention

of those who are responsible for the publication that

he is not

Q

I gathered from you that he is more reliable

than a staff member.
MR. PICKERING:
Q

No.

You are not saying that?

MR. PICKERING:

Oh, no, I am not saying that.

29
Q

You are not saying he is in a special category?

That is ail I wanted to get.
MR. PICKERING:

I would say that the head of the

Miami bureau's information is not to be imputed back to those
who were responsible for the organization any more than the
stringer.

Tha knowledge really has to be brought home to the

people who are responsible for what goes into the magazine.
Sure, they cannot just shut their eyes to matters.
To answer your precise question about whether he had seen and
your question about whether he had seen-Q

The Miami Herald.

MR. PICKERING:

—the Miami Herald, the best answer

I can give there is that he had at least talked to the
Associated Press people in checking this out, and they had the
same thing in the Associated Press dispatch, that the judge was
inclined to discount much of this testimony as unreliable.
But he did. not rule it out, and that is one reason we say that
Time

was not negligent.
Q

Actually what the stringer said was a lot more

accurate than what Time said, was it not?
MR. PICKERING:
Q

No.

The stringer's dispatch I think is hard to

fault.
MR. PICKERING:

It. says the technical grounds for

divorce were extreme cruelty and adultery, and that, in effect

30
is what the Time article said, on grounds of extreme cruelty
and adultery, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Q

I was reading Duncan.

MR. PICKERING;

Yes, I see.

Duncan says nothing about the grounds

for divorce,
Q

Duncan is completely accurate, as I se® it, but

ha is not the stringer.
MR. PICKERING;

That is correct.

Any further questions?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Pickering, in order

for you to make your plans, you may have observed that we have
taken a little bit of your time.

We will enlarge the time of

your friend and we will allow you four minutes for rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Your time will be enlarged

correspondingly.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS EDNA L. CARUSO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MISS CARUSO:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In this case I would like to stress at the very
beginning that throughout the appellate process in the case,

31

Tim®, Inc* has never ever argued until today that it is
entitled to a new trial.

The briefs that have been filed

throughout the appellate courts in Florida and the briefs that
are filed here today solely urge that they are entitled
judgment as a matter of law.

to a

That does not mean to say that

I do not think the Court has the power to decide that a new
trial should be granted, but that question has never been argued
by Tim© and has never been briefed.
Starting with point one on appeal, that is their
argument, that they truthfully reported a judicial decision
and this was an accurate reflection of what the divorce decree
stated.

And we would simply point out to the Court that while

the husband in this casci counterclaimed for divorce on the
grounds of adultery and mental cruelty, the divorce decree
solely stated that the husband's counterclaim for divorce
was granted.
They argue that that allows them to assume that it
was granted on all grounds, and I think we all know that the
only thing it allows us to assume is that the judge found in
favor of the husband on one of the grounds.
Q

Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals, Miss

Caruso, say that at least it was ambiguous and would lend
itself to a reading that it was based on adultery and also to
the contrary?
MISS CARUSO:

I think the District Court of Appeal

32
did hold that.
Q

What do we do with that?

That is an interpreta-

tion by a state court of your state court decree.
MISS CARUSO:

1 think that the Florida Supreme Court

later overruled that, and I think very clearly that th©
document was not ambiguous.
Q

You are saying the Supreme Court position and

opinion has superseded all that went before, the Court of
Appeals?
MISS CARUSO:

Yes, sir.

I think anyway in regard to this, in regard to
whether the .article adequately stated what was in th© divorce
decree in this case, the jury was instructed there can be no
recovery in this case

if you find from the greater weight of

the evidence that the article as published had no different
effect on th© mind of the reader than the divorce judgment
and/or that the article was substantially true.

And of course

the jury found in favor of Mrs. Firestone, and therefore they
found that the article did have a different effect on the
mind of the reader than the divorce decree.
If anything, we would submit that this was a question
for the jury, and the jury found against the position that my
opponent is urging here today.
Time, Inc. argues that there was absolutely no
evidence of negligence in this case on their part as a matter

33

of law, and we would submit to the Court that that is not true.
They first argued that of course their interpretation was
correct, and we submit that it was not.

They argued that their

editorial procedure was without fault, that there was no
negligence.
In this case we know that Time had received three
documents, dispatches, and articles, and also a dispatch from
a Mr, Delaney who was their stringer.

The three articles and

dispatches other than Delaney's did in no way, we would suomit,
say that the divorce was granted on the grounds of adultery.
Each of those articles or dispatches stated Mrs. Firestone
was accused cd adultery or her husband had counterclaimed for
adultery„
They did receive the dispatch their stringer, and he
stated that he had checked with her attorney and that the
technical grounds for the divorce were mental cruelty and
adultery.
However, we would submit to th© Court that the evidence
shows that even then, regardless of the dispatch from Dclrr

.

there was serious doubt in Time, Inc.'s mind as to whether or
not this was an accurate statement because there was testimony
to the effect that a Miss Nadasdy, who was a legal researcher
for Time, was supposed to, after the article was written, take
th© article and run what they call an. accuracy check on the
article, and she vas to make a determination that each and every

34
word was accurate and it was supportable.
She did not mark the word "adultery,"

She marked the

other words in tha article, 1 think with the exception of a
few, but she did not mark the word "adultery."
Q

What is the significance of the mark?
<

MISS CARUSOs
Q

Pardon me?

What is the significance of a mark, that it is

accurate?
MISS CARUSOs

Yes.

On top of each word she made a

little mark, and that means that she had checked it out end it
was her determination that that word was accurate.
We think that this testimony clearly indicates that
there was a serious doubt in her mind as to whether or not they
had sufficient information to support that or whether or not
they had sufficient sources to support the publication that
Mrs. Firestone had been found guilty of adultary.
However, of course, we know that Time went ahead and
released this publication saying that she had been found
guilty of adultery, and we would submit to the Court because
the divorce decree was rendered on a Friday night about 5;00
o'clock and their deadline for publication was Saturday night
at about 8s00 o'clock-—so, they wore pressed for time.
We think that that clearly indicates, if not
negligence-—I mean, not only negligence but a reckless dis­
regard on the part

of Time, Inc. for going ahead and publishing

35
the article when the employees did not even follow the require­
ment which they admitted that Time, Inc, imposed -upon them to
follow.
Q

I suppose you are taking the position that that

would in any event support a determination of negligence on the
part of Time Magazine in New York as distinguished from its
stringer in Florida?
MISS CARUSOs
to make that statement.

Yes.

2 was just getting ready

Yes.

They argued -that they should not be

held liable and cannot, under the law, be held liable for the
negligence on the part of “•■•the negligence—excuse me—cannot
be held liable for negligence of their stringer in investigating,

not been attempting to make Tim©, Inc. account for the
negligence of their stringer,

we are trying to make them

account for the negligence of their own employees for going
ahead and publishing this article when there was serious doubt in
their mind that the article was correct.

These are the acts of

negligence that we are attributing—
Q

At the home office?

MISS CARUSOt
G

Yes, sir.

People who actually authored the article or

helped prepare it.
MISS CARUSO?

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Their point -two is the argument that this was a

36

rational interpretation of an ambiguous document, and of course,
as you know, tha first argument in my brief is that the Pape
case is not even applicable to this case, and perhaps from some
of the comments here I might so© that you do think that it is
applicable, but 1 think that the Pape decision says that wha.i.
you have an ambiguous document and the publisher reads that
i

document and relies upon a rational interpretation of the
language in that document, then there is no malice as a matter
of law.
That does not mean that I think that everybody has
to go and read a document, that I think that if someone does
not read a document and there is a rational interpretation,
that they

have to be held liable»

only instruction they asked for was an instruction to

The
the

effect that you are instructed that a reasonable interpretation
of that divorce decree is that adultery was one of the grounds

37

for the divorce,.
So, we would submit to the Court that in the trial
court they have not sufficiently laid the groundwork to raise
this point on appeal.
Then we come to the actual malice standard, and they
have two arguments.

Number one, that Rose abloom and Cox

Broadcasting have extended the New York Times document to
report through judicial proceedings.

And we would first say

that we really do not read those cases as doing that.

I think

the Cox Broadcasting case says essentially that truth is the
defense, that if you truthfully report a judicial proceeding
or judicial report, then it is a defense.

And I think we have

shown in this case that their publication was not truthful.
The second question and perhaps one of the mosc
relevant here is whether or not Mrs. Firestone was a public
figure and therefore whether or not the standard of actual
malice was applicable.
Of coarse, how do you determine this?

And we are going

to have to look to the very decisions of this Court, to the
language in those decisions.

I think the one that comes most

to mind is Gertz because there I think it was talked about
perhaps more than

other decisions.

Some of the language is:

A public figure is one who has voluntarily placed himself in
the public spotlight by reason of notoriety of their achieve­
ments or the vigor and success with which they seek the public’s

38
attention that they become labeled as public figures.

They

thrust themselves to the forefront of public controversies in
order to influence the resolution of those issues.
attention and comment.

They invite

They voluntarily expose themselves to

the increased risk of injury from defamation.

I think that that

^ is generally the language in Gertz.
In this case I would like to point out that although
Mrs. Firestone did file a complaint in this case for separate
maintenance, unconnected with divorce, she did not file for
divorce.

Her husband, of course, counterclaimed against her

for divorce.

She did not institute the divorce proceedings.

Therefore, it would be our contention she was involuntarily
drawn into the divorce proceeding.
We can only say that simply because the newspapers
cho.se to write about Mrs. Firestone and to write about her
divorce does not make her a public figure.

She was married

to a wealthy man, and we certainly admit that.
wealthy man.
divorce.

He was a very

But the woman was a housewife, and he sued for

We think that up until that time-Q

She was a housewife?

MISS CARUSO:
Q

Yes, sir.

What did she do in the house?

MISS CARUSO:

I am sorry, I do not mean to—perhaps

I should not say she was a housewife in that sense.
think she was a public figure in her own right.

I do not.

She was simply

39

married to a very wealthy man»

I do not know what chores she

performed around the house, sir.
Q

Miss Caruso, why did you give up your claim

on reputation?
MISS CARUSO:
Q

I think that—

You did give it up?

MISS CARUSO:

We withdrew the claim for loss of

reputation.
Q

And did that not change the whole lawsuit?

MISS CARUSO:
think so.

I do not think so? no, sir.

I do not

I will tell you quite frankly why that was done.

This woman had just been through a very lengthy divorce suit, and
as a practical matter it was not thought that she could with­
stand having the witnesses that were paraded through the
divorce suit--and I am talking about on both sides, I am not
pointing simply to her husband, but we all know from the record
that there were many, many witnesses that came in and testified
as to activities outside the marriage on both parties.

For a

number of physical and emotional reasons, it was thought that
the worn an should not have to go through this again and did not
want to have to go through this again.

So, that is why they

withdrew the claim for loss to reputation.
Q

That is completely out of the case?

MISS CARUSO:
Q

Yes, sir.

Biit nevertheless apparently is a basis for

40

recovery under Florida law.
MISS CARUSO:
Q

1 think there is a basis for recovery—

The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed.

You won,

did you not?
MISS CARUSO:
Q

Yes, sir.

Even though it was for another kind of injury.

MISS CARUSO:
Q

I think it was—I think—

It was not, an injury to reputation you recovered.

MISS CARUSO:

Mo, sir.

I think that under a defamation

action we clearly do not have to seek each of the elements that
can be sought.
Q

What was it, damages for mental anguish?

MISS CARUSO:
Q

Mental anguish, humiliation.

How can you separate really mental anguish and

impingement upon reputation?
MISS CARUSO:
specifically.

I am not sure that I can answer that

Let me see if I can do it this way.

In this

trial, there was testimony, for example, just by Mrs. Firestone
that she had a little son and that she lived every day with the
thought that he was going to be old enough to read about this
and find, out about it and that that was something

she lived

with and feared every day of her life.
The judge in this case ruled that that had nothing to
do with her

reputation; that had something to do with the

mental state of that woman and being extremely distressed over

41
that.

And so I think that you can separate.

what if a person does not have a reputation?

And, if I may,
What if you have

someone who is not known by—that he is a hermit or something
and no one knows this man and he does not have a reputation or
standing in the community and yet someone libels him?

Certainly

the man for his own mental pain and anguish over what he has
withstood—
Q

Would you say the converse of that would be that

a very thick-skinned person might suffer no mental anguish but
merely have a sense of anger but have his reputation in general
damaged, thus separating these two things?
MISS CARUSO:

I think so.

And I think that the

language in Gertz, to me it says that.

Gertz says if they

prove actual damages, you cam prove negligence or you can prove
other than malice.

And the Court says there, "Actual injury

is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.

Indeed, the more customary

types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehoods include
impairment of reputation and standing in the community."

It goes

on to say personal humiliation and mental anguish and suffering,
and then it goes on to say, talk about, the jury should be
correctly instructed on these elements of damages.

And it is

our point we would not have to pursue as an element of damage
the loss of reputation, that we could pursue the other elements
of injury to this woman.
Q

What were the consequences under Florida lav? as

42
to—what would be admissible in evidence when she abandoned her
claim for damage to reputation?
MISS CARUSO:
Q

In proof of her damages* sir?

By abandoning her claim for damage to reputation*

did she preclude the use of certain evidence on the part of
the defendant?

That even if

he had not been granted a divorce

for adultery* he should have been?
MISS CARUSO:

,

I think that it precluded either party

putting on going to her reputation* yes* sir., and that was what
we were trying to prevent because of the lengthy trial before
•that where all of this has been
Q

brought out,

Miss Caruso, what standard do you think the

Supreme Court applied in this case, the Hew York Times standard
or the Certa standard?
MISS CARUSO:
Q

I think they applied Gertz.

What evidence of negligence was cited by the

Supreme Court, of Florida in support of liability under the
Gertz standard?
MISS CARUSO:

Quit© frankly, I would have to relook at,

the decision, sir,
Q

The only specific evidence that I recall was that

since under Florida law alimony could not be granted an adultress
that as a sort of a per se result the Supreme Court of Florida
found negligence.

Is that your reading of the case?

MISS CARUSO:

If I may have just one second--

43

Q

It is in appendix C of the—-well, I do not want

to interrupt your argument.
MISS CARUSO;
Q

That is all right.

Appendix C?

C-10 contains the concluding paragraph of the

Florida court.
[Pause]
I know that it is very difficult to pick up language
unless you have been looking at it.
MISS CARUSO;

So—

I would submit to the Court that I think

that the re--I do not frankly recall the specific things pointed
to in the Florida Supreme Court decision.

Unfortunately we

have had a number of decisions in Florida courts on this.
However, I think that clearly, clearly, the evidence presented
in this case supports the finding of negligence on their part.
Q

The court said that if anybody had looked at the

decree, it would have been plain what the grounds were, and
that a careful examination of the final decree would have
clearly demonstrated that the divorce had been granted on the
grounds of cruelty, not adultery.

That is what your Supreme

Court said.
MISS CARUSO;

Yes, I would agree with that, and I

would also say that I think a reading of the divorce decree
would not allow one to assume that it had been on adultery, and
that would be negligence, yes, sir.
But also I think the important part about Time, Inc.8s

44
employees not even following their own standard to make sure
that they are actually reporting something when the employees-*Q

There is a boilerplate ahead of the paragraph

that Mr. Justice White referred to.

"Careful examination and

consideration of the record discloses that the judgment of the
trial court is correct and should have been affirmed on appeal."
Does that sweep in the ground you argue, namely, the failure at
the New York home office of those involved in the publication,
particularly the failure to spot the word "adultery,” satisfies
the requirement of negligence?
MISS CARUSO:
Q

No, sir, I do not think so.

The Supreme Court did not say anything about

that, did it?
MISS CARUSO:

In this case I think the distinction

is that in this case we have the woman who is responsible for
running an accuracy check.
Q

Yes, but your Supreme Court did not rely on that

fact, did it?
MISS CARUSO:

I do not think that was mentioned in

there, no,sir.
Q

Unless it is in this catch-all paragraph I have

just read you.
MISS CARUSO:

No, sir, I do not think they specific-

ally pointed that out; no, sir.
Q

I suppose the Supreme Court of Florida has

45
occasion on more than one appeal to simply summarily say there
is sufficient evidence of negligence and

w@ disallow that pointy

without going into great detail as to why they think there is
sufficient evidence of nesgligance.
MISS CARUSO:
Q

Yes.

I think if they are reversing another appellate

court, do they often do that that cryptically?

It is one thing

when you are affirming; it is something else when you are
reversing.
MISS CARUSO:
Q

Yes, sometimes they do, sir; yes, sir.

Certainly there is nothing in the Federal

Constitution that would prevent them from doing it.
MISS CARUSO:

Mo, sir, I do not think so.

If there are no other questions, I conclude.
Q

In the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida

there is a statement to the effect that the trial court found

this is a misprint, but we would have to check that to be sure,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. PICKERING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PICKERING:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Before you get started,

let me just ask you one question that y$u can handle briefly.
This testimony on page 200, which has been alluded to indirectly

that when she—the document was in evidence.

appeared above each of the key words in the article? the
pencil check of the researcher? except the word "adultery."
Do you suppose that testimony was overlooked by the jury?

I

am speaking now not of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals
but by the jury in coming to its conclusions.
MR. PICKERING:

No? Your Honor, because I think it

was made very clear in the testimony that that absence of a

That is what Miss

Nadasdy testified.

That was her testimony.

MR. PICKERING:

our brief, and I can give you the record references for that

testimony as set: forth in the brief, and the researcher Nadasdy
and the editor both testified, at pages 2 and 3 of our reply
brief, that the absence of the check mark over that signified
nothing.

There were several other words without a check

And if you will look at—

Some of them ware, yes.

Was there only one key word in this litigation,

and that is the word "adultery”?
MR, PICKERING:

There is only one ley word as far as
But in making an a ccurate statement

to the general public, Mr. Chief Justice, there are a number of
key words.
Let me give one more reason why any knowledge of the
stringer Delaney cannot be attributed to Time.

The New York

Times case itself I think makes that plain because there was
knowledge in the files of the New York Times itself that
contradicted the advertisement.

But this Court said that did not

MR, PICKERING:

It is an easier

test; I grant you that.
My opponent referred to the failure of Time to
request jury instructions.

Time requested jury instructions--

they appear in the record at 557-558—on all of the Constitu­

And that included all of this.

Several questions dealt with, Why was the claim for
reputation withdrawn and did not that do something?

If I could

for just one second respond to that, the claim for damagl to
reputation was withdrawn because it was quite clear Time was,
prepared to do in proving this; and the danger that follows
from allowing a claim for & representation to be withdrawn is
clear from the record in this case because Mrs. Firestone
testified the thing that concerned her most about this
article was that some day, as counsel for the respondent has
said, some day her infant son would hear about it and understand
what it meant.

That-appears in the record at 393, and the

jury sent back a query, in the record at page 515 to the judge,
asking if they could award

compensatory damages to the son in

trust for him.
The judge answered no without consulting with the
attorneys.

The verdict then came in for $100,000 compensatory

damage.

Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Pickering.

Thank you, Miss Caruso.
