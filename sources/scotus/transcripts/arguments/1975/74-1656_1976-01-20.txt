P ROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 74-1656 and 75-50 , regarding floe and Confederated Salish
and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation.
Mr. IIaddon# you may proceed when you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAM E. HADDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF JOHN C. MOE, ET AL.
MR. HADDON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The consolidated appeals arise out of final
judgments of a three-judge court of the District of Montana,
in two companion cases.

Both actions were filed by the

Confederated Tribes of the Flathead Reservation, and certain
individual tribal members, against the State of Montana and
certain of its public officials, seeking, in the so-called
cigarette case, to enjoin the State from requiring a cigarette
dealer’s license tax for Indian retailers, and to enjoin the
precollection of State cigarette taxes on cigarettes which
were sold by these Indian retail dealers.
The other case, the personal property tax, sought
to enjoin the State from the collection of personal property
taxes on property owned by tribal members residing within
the Flathead Reservation.
The three-judge court was convened under

28 U.S.C.

2284, and the court, by divided vote — Judge Smith dissenting

4
in both cases —- held that the Montana cigarette tax, the
excise tax on dealers and on the sale of cigarettes themselves
were in part invalid.

And a final injunction was entered

against the State of Montana prohibiting the State from
requiring a cigarette dealer’s license tax of the dealers
on the reservation.
And also enjoining the State of Montana from collecting
the tax on sales of cigarettes to Indians.
The court in the cigarette tax case also ruled that
the State of Montana could require the p re-col lecti on of the
tax on sales of cigarettes made to non-Indians.
In the personal property tax case, fche collection of
personal property taxes from individual Indian residents of
the Flathead Reservation was enjoined.
The State, by these consolidated appeals, has
appealed from the portion of the judgment in both cases, which
enjoins the collection on the one hand of the cigarette tax,
and on the other the personal property tax.
The -QUESTIONS

Mr. IIaddont let me ask you 'something

about the Montana personal property tax for licensing
vehicles, and perhaps I can best put the question bv telling
you what I understand to be the Virginia law, which is the
jurisdiction I happen to live in.

In Virginia we pay a

personal property tax on personal property including

5
automobiles , and -then you pay an additional fee to license
the vehicle to travel on the road.

Mow, is that the law in

Montana , or ere the two combined into one?
MR. HADDONs

The tax<3@ paid at one time, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, but there are both a — there is both a personal
property tax on the vehicle itself and a separate fee for
registration of the vehicle.
QUESTIONS

Did the district court, enjoin the

enforcement of the fee for the registration of the vehicle?
MR. HADDONs

No.

The district court did not,.

The tribes and the

individual members of the tribes, who were acting as plaintiffs,
had indicated their willingness to pay the registration fee,
not the tax.
QUESTION;

And that fee is not in issue here?

MR. HADDONs
QUESTION:

That fee is not in issue, Your Honor.
What is in issue, in addition to the

cigarette tax, is simply the personal property tax on the
automobile? is that it?
MR. HADDONs

Primarily upon automobiles, but also

other types of personal property:

cattle, farm equipment,

items of that sort which are classified under Montana law as
personal property.
QUESTION:
MR. HADDONs

Right.
These appeals raise the cere issue to

6

which this argument will be principally addressed, of whether
the immunity from State taxation in favor of Indian citizens
on the Flathead Reservation, found by the district court to ba
available, and this additional immunity from State taxation
which the tribes and their members seek with regard to sales
of cigarettes to non™ Indians , whether this immunity, in its
entirety, is invalid and unconstitutional under the due process
and equal protection concepts of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments.
The Flathead Reservation in northwestern Montana,
and from which -these cases arise, is a unique ge^graphical
area, and as an Indian Reservation and as a part of Montana
it is unique.
In order to appreciate the factual concept, I would
like to go in, in some detail, to the facts which give rise to
this case.
The Flathead Reservation is approximately 1,250,000
acres.

It comprises four parts — parts of four Montana,

counties.

Poison, one of the county seats of Montana, is

located entirely within the confines of the Rese rvation.
It was created by the Treaty of Hell G ite in 1855,
from lands which were a part of the then Washington Territory,
and which, of course, later became -the State of Montana.
In 1904, Congress enacted legislation which opened
■the reservation for allotment to individual Indians, and for

7
sale of surplus unallotted lands to non-Indians.
As a result of this opening of the reservation,,
something over 400,000 acres was sold to non-Indians, and an
additional 60,000 acres was granted to the State of Montana
for school purposes, other acreages were passed to religious
institutions, schools, and others.
So, at the present time, the mix on the reservation,
insofar as land ownership is concerned, is that over one-half
of the land on the reservation is held in fee, principally by
non-Indian owners.
The balance: of the reservation property, something
slightly less than one-half, is held in part by individual
Indians in trust title and, in part, by the tribes in tribal
statute.
The tribal lands, as the record shows, being
principally located in sparsely populated foothill and mountain
\

areas *
The Flathead Reservation at the present time is a
well-developed agricultural area.

It is an area with farms,

ranches, communities scattered all over its inhabited parts.
It has an elaborate irrigation system which serves the farm
and ranching communities, and farm and ranching areas, 'which
was created under congressional action in part, and by use of
State law and through use of the State courts in the State of
Montana.

And it is not. — and we think this important — a

8

place where Indians live alone or in isolation.
They are scattered randomly throughout the reservation,
they live in integrated communities, they participate in all
of Indian,, or all of community activities and services.
QUESTION;

But there’s no question but that it does

remain a reservation} is that right?
MR. HADDON;

That is not in — that is correct,,

Mr. Justice,, there is no issue in this appeal as to the con­
tinuation of the status of the reservation.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. HADDON;

There are approximately 13,000 people

who live within the confines of this reservation.
20 percent of whom are classified as Indians.

Less than

The Indians

themselves are an ethnically mixed group of individuals.
Something less than 4,000 are
less than one-half Indian nlood.

or something over 4,000 are
Some are as small as one-

sixteenth Indian blood.
Families themselves are mixed, with one parent, or
one of the members of the family being an. Indian or an ,
enrolled tribal member, the other not being so.

In some

instance, children of a particular family are in part tribal
members, and in part non-tribal members.
It remains, however, that the only way that one can
claim status as an Indian is to be born as such with an
irrequisite amount of Indian blood.

The Indian citizen an the Flathead Reservation
participates in all facets of community life.

They vote.

They hold office. They have access to the courts.
schools provided hy the State of Montana.

They attend

In short, they are

totally integrated into the society of the area, and they all
participate in all aspects of citizen life of the State of
Montana.
QUESTION;

Mr. Haddon, as to all this, there isn’t

any dispute, is there?

I think ws know this background.

1 am

anxious for you to get to the issues.
MR. HADDON;

Surely.

The tribes themselves have leased land to the
individual Indian plaintiffs on whom the — on where the smoke
shops were erected, and took action to file the instant case
after the State of Montana attempted to preclude the sale of
the cigarettes with tax stamps affixed.
The personal property tax suit was likewise
instituted following refusal of the State of Montana to omit
the Indian citizens from collection •*— or from payment of the
tax.
We suggest that the approach which is taken by the
tribes and by -the individual Indian citizens in this case seeks
to draw what amounts to a line around a portion of the State
of Montana, and to say that if a particular individual citizen
of the State is a member of a particular ethnic or racial

10

group, that is , an Indian, and that if he resides within that
area, then he must not pay taxes to the State of Montana*
QUESTION;
MR. HADDON;

Who drew that line originally, Mr. Haddon?
Well, the line, of course, Your Honor,

is the direct, result of the establishment of the confines of
the Flathead Indian Reservation by the Treaty of Hall Gate in
1855,
QUESTION:
MR. HADDON;

So it isn't a new line, is it?
Indeed, it is not? it has existed for

over 100 years.
Our position is — notwithstanding the existence of
the Flathead Reservation -*■- is that this treatment of Indian
citizens for tax purposes, differently from other citizens
of the State of Montana, cannot be carried into practice
without creating a conflict between the requirements of equal
protection and due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments and the particular practice.
The practice, as we see it, allows the Indian
citizen to have and to continue to receive all o:: the benefits
of citizenship of the State, and yet not be responsible for
the fair share of burdens of -that citizenship.
We suggest that this Court has already considered the
question of benefits versus burdens, or benefits and burdens,
as a part of the role of citizenship in the Oklahoma Tax
Commission case, and the facts are not unlike the facts which

11
are before the Court in this case.
And there the Court noted that tax exemptions were
/

not to be granted by implication, and that the tax which was
sought to be imposed by the State of Oklahoma was valid.
We suggest that the reasoning and analysis found to
be applicable in that case is equally applicable to the case
at bar.
We suggest that,constitutional issues iside, that
the facts of the Oklahoma Tax Commission case are better suited,
are fit more precisely with the facts of the case at bar than
do the facts in McClanahan.
In McClanahan, tit ere was little interaction between
the Indian community and the non-Indian community.
Navahoes lived apart, on a separate reservation.

The
There was,

by Williams vs. Lee, no State responsibility toward those
Indian citizens, although the opinion of the Court in
McClanahan indicates that there was some extension of State
services and some State responsibilities toward tJiose Indian
residents of the Flathead *-~ or of the Navaho Reservation.
In McClanahan there was no opening of the reservation
to ownership of land by non-Indians, and no general occupancy
of that area by non-Indians.
QUESTION;

From your argument, Mr. Uaddon, I take

it that, at least part of your argument is, that you’re
asserting Fourteenth Amendment claims, are you, c*r Fifth

12

Amendment claims, equal protection claims on behalf of the
non-Indian citizens of Montana?
MR. IIADDON:

That is correct, Your Hon Dr.

We believe that the matter is in fact twofolds

that,

on the one hand, -QUESTION;

That's a unique basis for a State to

collect a tax, isn't it?
MR. IIADDON;

I acknowledge that I am unaware of

any case prior to this case in which this particular argument
has been advanced.
We feel, as was found by Judge Smith ii his dissent,
that if this program is carried into effect, that it has the
ultimate result of relieving one racial class of a burden of
citizenship, namely taxation, which ve suggest is violative of
the Fifth Amendment, because it is mandated by the United
States.
And that it, on the other hand, imposes upon another
class of citizens, namely the non-Indian citizens of the State
of Montana, an obligation to provide services to those who
are exempt from the taxation.
QUESTION;

Mr. Haddon, let me interrupt you further.

Does an Indian vendor, who has his place of busiless on a
reservation, have to purchase a Montana license to sell
cigarettes?
MR. HADDON;

The ruling of the district court was

13
that he did not.

There is a dealer’s license tan; that is

required in the State of Montana, by the Stats of Montana.
One of the issues determined by the lower court was that that
dealer’s license tax did not have to be paid by the individual
Indian dealers.
QUESTION:

Is this separate and distinct from the

tax on the cigarettes themselves?
MR. HADDON;

It is a different kind of tax? and is

imposed upon a different individual, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. IIADDON:
QUESTION:

Is it at issue here?
Yes , it is.
Next, is there any Montana statute -that

makes it a criminal offense for anyone to use a cigarette from
an unstamped package?
MR. HADDON:

It is — it is a criminal offense: to

buy untax-paid cigarettes.
I am unaware of a criminal offense directly related
to the license tax itself for the dealer.
QUESTION: Well, then, may you argue that the State of
Montana has an interest, a distinct interest, in preventing
anyone from violating that statute; namely the purchase of
an unstamped cigarette package?
MR. HADDON:

We certainly do, Your Honor.

And we

feel that the decision of the district court, to the extent
that it upheld the position of the State of Montana, that the

14
tax could be precollected from non-Indian purchasers is
entirely valid»

Because to rule to the contrary would have

been an invitation for all of those non-Indian purchasers of
cigarettes to violate the lav/»
QUESTION;

I guess I didn't get. that argument from

your brieff focusing on that State interest.

But you've

satisfied me now.
All right.
HR. HADDON:

Another factor of some importance in

connection with this appeal, while not directly related to the
issue of constitutional due process and equal protection, is
the application of -the General Allotment Act to the Flathead
Reservation.
QUESTION;

The Act of 1377.

MR. II ADDON :

Yes.

The record shows that the Flathead Ressrvation was
open for settlement -- I beg your pardon — opened for allot­
ment to individual Indians in severalty under tha provisions
of the General Allotment Act.
And that General Allotment Act, by its specific terms,
recites that upon expiration of the trust patent period the
the individual Indian patentee is to be considered as a
citizen of the State and to he entitled to all of the benefits
of State citizenship and subject to the laws of the State.
QUESTION;

Now, was that Act applicabis to the

15
Flathead Reservation in 1877?
HR. 11 ADDON;
QUESTION:

No,, it was not, Your Honor.
And is there any significance in the fact

it did not become applicable until — when?
MR. HADDON:

1904.

1904?

I think there is no significance

other than tine fact that the reservation was not open for
general allotment prior to 1904.
We suggest that the specific language of the General
Allotment Act is consistent with the position foand by this
Court in the Oklahoma Tax Commission case, that, the burdens of
State citizenship go with the benefits of State citizenship.
And there are, on the Flathead Reservation at this time, as
the record will show, individual Indian citizens who received
patents under the terms of the General Allotment Act.
And if this Court should uphold the position of the
lower court, we suggest that it creates a very anomalous
situation, that the General Allotment Act, havini been
intended to protect the interest of the individual Indian
patentee, and having said that that Indian patentee is to be
protected until such time as the patent trust expires, that
if that individual is, by the language of the Act, to be
subject to the laws of the State and no others are to be
subject to the laws of the State, then those who have not
received patents are those who benefit from the decision of
the lower court.

16
We suggest that the issue which we present here has
not been presented in any case prior to this one.
Martin vs. Mancari

,

The case of

which considered the particular and unique

relationship of the members of recognized Indian tribes in
their employment with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not,
we think, reach the issue before this Court.
We would point out that the Court, in Martin vs.
Mancarif was concerned about whether or not a general rule
could be laid down that would apply a special kind of
exemption fop Indians in all matters of civil service
employment.

And we think that sets the tone and pattern for

the issue here? that while that particular case '?as justifiable
on its facts, because of the unique relationship of the
federal government to Indians through the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, that its concepts and precepts cannot bs applied to
the facts of the case at bar.
We feel thcit there is, in reality, no true conflict,
between the general regulatory provisions of Article I,
Section 8, Clause 3 and the position which we assert here.
Congress remains, we suggest, free to do whatever it
deems necessary in carrying out its practices and policies
with regard to Indian citizens.

In particular, it can continue

to control the disposition and use of Indian lands.
But the rights to which we speak rest xn a different
level, and we think that no additional congressional action

17
is necessary to make these rights operative, as tfe feel they
should be a
The rights, if they exist, the State may, we suggest,
do all that is necessary to carry those rights into implementation, including exercise of whatever jurisdiction is necessary
to insure collection of the taxes0
QUESTIONS

Well, are you — you're arguino both

cigarettes and property.
MR. IIADDON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Mow, how about

assume an automobile

was used solely on a reservation, never went off the reserva­
tion, solely on property that had been an Indian reservation
for a hundred years.
MR. 11 ADDON:

Our basic position, Mr. Justice White,

is that it makes no difference whether the particular personal
property is used on the reservation entirely —
QUESTION: So you figure on a -- you could put your
personal property tax on property owned by soldiars on a
military reservation?
MR. 11ADDON:
proposition.

We suggest that that is not the sane

Because —

QUESTION:
MR. IIADDON:

Well, you say that's different?
Yes.

We feel -that the unique status

of the military and the role that it plays is not -the same
as that of a citizen of this country who, except for the fact

/

18
that he is an Indian,.is no different from any other citizen.
QUESTION;

So your personal property tax could be

applied to any personal property that an Indian .owned, even
•chough he lived on the reservation,
MR. HADDON:
QUESTION:
MR. HADDON:

That is correct.
-— and used it there only.
Evan though it were used there only.

Of course we
QUESTION;

I take it, any authority to that effect

you've cited in your brief?
MR. IIADDON: We have cited all the authority that
we have, and we have no case specifically in point on that
subject, obviously.
QUESTION:
MR. IIADDON:

Yes.
We feel that the position that we assert,

here is that the case is more basic because of the considera»'
tions of due process and equal protection than any of the
precedents heretofore in —
QUESTION:

But you were permitted to use the —- to

have the Indians collect idle sales tax on sales ho non-Indians?
MR. IIADDON:

That is correct.

And that is -the

subject
QUESTION:
.MR. HADDON:
QUESTION;

But not on sales to Indians.
That is correct.
And you could not make them get a license.

19

MR. HADDON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Yes.

MR. I?ADDON;

All right.

To elaborate very briefly on one of the

questions 'that you asked, Mr. Justice White:
One of the problems, as we view it in this case, is
that the court ruled in the cigarette tax case that the State
of Montana could not collect the tax from anyone who was
classified as an Indian.
QUESTION:

That term remains undefined.

7md do you think the court ruled that

Montana not only could not put the personal property tax on
an automobile, but could rot put it on the automobile even
though it was used off the reservation?
MR. HADDON:

That is the effect, as we read the

court’s — the lower court's decision.
QUESTION:

So you are — you think the court’s

already decided that Montana may not say to the Indians:
If you v/ant to use your automobile off the reservation, you
must pay a tax.
MR. HADDON:

That is our understandirg of the

lower court's decision.

It is one of the matters specifically

to which Judge Smith's dissenting opinion is addressed.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION;

Mr. Iladdon, if vour argumer t is valid

about, the discrimination aspects, I take it the same argument
would apply to a reservation which had 100 percent Indian

20

population and all full-blooded Indians?
I’n just wondering if there is really anything — I
don’t quite understand the relevance of your initial
description of the unique character of this reservation.

How

does that relate to the argument you’re making?
MR. HADDON:

Like all advocates, perhaps, Mr. Justice

Stevens, we like to have a position to fall back to.
basic position is that it makes no difference.

Our

If a citizen

is a citizen, it makes no difference what his race is, nor
where he lives, he has the same obligations as any other
citizen.

He is —
QUESTION:

falling back, then?

What is the position to which you’re
That's what I‘d like to know.

[Laughter. 3
MR. HADDON:

The position to which we fall back is

that if the Court should deem it inappropriate to accept -chat
interpretation of -the lav;, that, ws have, in this particular
case, a unique set of factual circumstances akin to the
Oklahoma Tax Commission case, which dictate the application of
the rule of that case rather than the application of the rule

5

of McClanahan.
QUESTION:
state it for me.

The rule being what?

Maybe you better

I’m not as familiar with the case as I should

i
I

be.
MR. HADDON;

Rs I read the rule of McClanahan —

21
QUESTION %

No, what is the rule of the case on which

you rely?
NR. IIADDON:

That the individual Indian citizens-

residents of the State of Oklahoma, were subject to, in that
instance, an inheritance tax imposed by tie State of Oklahoma.
The Court being concerned with and pointing to the
facts that they were essentially amalgamated into the Oklahoma
society and were citizens in all respects of the State of
Oklahoma.
That being distinguishable from the situation in
McClanahan, where the Court points out that the individual
Navaho resident of the Navaho Reservation lives Largely apart,
and without influence by or responsibility to or from the
State of Arizona.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You're cutting into your

rebuttal time, if you hope to save any.

In fact, I think

you're used it up.
MR. IIADDON:

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Baenen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. BAENEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE CONFEDERATED SALISH AND
KOOTENAI TRIBES OF THE FLATHEAD RESERVATION, ET AL.
MR. BAENEN;
i

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it. please

the Court;
I think perhaps we can approach this argument by

/

22
noting one or two matters at the outset»
The 1970 Census, prepared by the Department of
Commerce, shows that there are 115 reservations in the United
States,, which are recognized by the Secretary of the Interior,
pursuant to the congressional authority contained in the
Indian Reorganization, or Wheeler-IIoward . Act, as it is
popularly known.
In addition, that in fiscal 1975 the United States
spent, through federal appropriations, $766 million pursuant
to its federal policy on Indians and Indian affairs.
In 1790, the United States enacted its first
statute relating to Indians, tine Indian Nonintercourse Act.
The United States has been intimately involved in Indian
affairs from then down to this date.
We have, on the Flathead Reservation,

a situation

where, by virtue cf the historical development, and certain
congressional activities, an integrated reservation.

We do

not have, and counsel for the State has been unanle to point
to a single case or a single legal ruling or a single federal
statute which would say that the Flathead Reservation, and
the question of State jurisdiction as it applies to Indians
on that reservation, is any different than in th a cases
involving the Navaho Reservation, such as McClanahan? the
Navaho Reservation, such as Williams v. Lee; the Flathead
Reservation ~ excuse me, the Blackfoot Reservation, such as

\

23
we find in Kennerly.
QUESTION;

In your view, the McClanahan case disposes

of all these issues?
MR, BAENEN2

In our view, the McClanahan case and

the cases that preceded it, Wi111ams v. Lee, Warren Trading
Post, Kennerly, Mescalero Apache, dispose of this issue.
With the exception for the one decision by the court below,
holding that the State of Montana could force tribal members
residing on the reservation to precollect the personal property
tax that is owed by the non-Indian purchaser when he
purchases from a tribal smoke shop, as they are called.
We do not believe -- and we believe the McClanahan v.
Arizona settles that question -— that the State cannot force
a tribal member to collect a cigarette tax owed by a non­
member and for which the

non-member is guilty of a State

violation should he purchase and have in his property, or in
his possession such a cigarette tax; and the State of Montana
has criminal jurisdiction over that non-Indian should he
violate the State law.
QUESTION;

Didn't we have an issue similar to that

in the Tonaskat case three or four terms ago, that we remanded
to the — back to the Washington, State of Washington court?
MR, BAENEN;

You did, Your Honor.

In the Tonaskat

case the issue related to the question of precollection from
non-Indians.

You remanded the case to the Supreme Court of

24

the State of Washington for reconsideration of its decision,
which held that the State could force the Indian salesman
to collect the tax from the non-Indian purchaser in light of
a Washington enactment which was passed by the Washington
Legislature after the State Supreme Court decision- which
held that non-Indians could possess two cartons at any one
time of unstamped cigarettes, and there would not be a
violation of the Washington law.
The Supreme Court of Montanta — excusa nef the
Supreme Court of Washington,, upon remand from this Court,
determined that the precollection requirement did not violate
the constitutional or statutory rights of the Indians on the
Colville Reservation.

This case did --- this Court did not

review the case on the grounds that there was want of a
substantial federal question.
Five months later the State of Washington revoked
the law by which non-Indians could possess two cartons of
unstamped cigarettes.
That is the present statute, as it relates to
Washington —
QUESTION; So, if I understood your correctly, the
law of Washington now is the same as the law of Montana now;
is that right?
MR. BAENEN:

The law of Washington is the same as

the three-judge court below? that is correct.

Tie law in —

QUESTION;

In other words, ‘the State may collect

from Indian sellers the prepayment of taxes on cigarettes
sold to non-Indian buyers? is that it?
MR. BAENEN;
sticky wicket here.
QUESTION;
MR. BAENENs

Well, v>e gat into a very difficult and
The —
Well, do I understand the lav; right?
Well, the three-judge court below

said that the State may force — that the Indian must collect
this cigarette tax, the sales tax, and admitted, however,
that how this would be implemented, how it would be carried
out, since the State does not have jurisdiction 3ver the tribal
members who are exercising — who are effectuating the sale.
They recognise that this would be an extremely difficult
problem.
They suggested in their order that the/ assumed 'this
Court would perhaps review its decision, and that, based upon
whatever guidance it might receive from -this Court — assuming
that it was not reversed — that we would try to work out
some type of a procedure.
We submit that the question was raised in McCianahan,
and the State had no answer when the question wa3 asked as to
how the State could allege and assert that its income taxes
were enforeible against Mrs. McCianahan for income earned
while residing on the reservation, when the Stat2 conceded
that it had no jurisdiction over her to compel tie collection

26

of that tax.
QUESTION;

How is it done out in the State of

Washington,, in the wake of the Tonasket litigation?
MR. BAENEN;

I have no knowledge, Your Honor? I

cannot answer your question.
QUESTION;

I do not know.

But that is the lav/ out thare, that’s -the

State law now, isn’t it?
MR. BAENEN;

That is the law.

I understand,

however, that there is a case pending in Idle Ninth Circuit
which involves that issue? and I understand, further, that the
Ninth Circuit has stayed consideration of the particular issue
until this

upon granting of jurisdiction in tiis case, the

Ninth Circuit stayed any determination until this case should
speak ~~ until this Court should speak in this case.

That is

the present status.
We do not believe that the Court need

to

beyond

McClanahan and the cases cited as supportive of Lt to affirm
the decision of the court below as it relates to the
inapplicability of the cigarette licensing and tie cigarette
sales tax on Indians,, as far as transactions are concerned on
the reservation? nor to reverse the court below on the
**

requirement that an Indian selling to non-Indian 3 on that
reservation must precollect and turn over the tax to the State.
QUESTION;

Mr. Baenen, are you going ;o devote

some part of your oral argument to the anti-injunction Act?

27

MR. BARMEN:

Most certainly, if the Cuurt would

please.
QUESTION;

I would like to ask you a question at

such time as you get to it.

Your opposing counsel didn't

devote any of his oral argument to it, and you're certainly
not obligated to.
MR. BAENEN;

Fine. Well, Your Honor, i am happy to

entertain a question, because we believe that Me ?Ianahan
supports our position down the line, and I don't believe that
anything is gained by me reasserting that.
QUESTION;

So —-

Well, but McClanahan came ip from the

Supreme Court of Arizona, didn't it?
MR. BAENEN:
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
So you don't have any problem with the

Anti-injunction Act in McClanahan.
MR. BAENEN;
QUESTION;

Correct.
So how does McClanahan bear one way or the

other on the Anti-injunction Act?
MR. BAENEN;

No.

I’m sorry, Your Honor.

Not on ~

I was not addressing your answer to the — I was not trying to
answer your question on the Anti-injunction Act by citing
McClanahan.

I was on the merits.

QUESTION;
MR. BAENEN:
QUESTION:

I see.

Just on the merits.

Correct.

On the merits.

Just before, then, you leave the merits

28

to move onto —
MR. BAENENr
QUESTION:

Certainly.
my brother Rehnquist’s interest in the

Anti™injunction Act.
McClanahan or no other case in this Court,

so far

as I know — and you can tell me if I’m mistaken? I may well be
— considered this constitutional argument, did it?

This —-

MR. BAENENs To my knowledge -—
QUESTION:

— equal protection argument is what I’m

talking about.
MR. BAENEN:

-- it was not addressed as an arqument,

as such.
Certainly a number of the decisions of this Court,
in which Treaty rights have been vindicated by Iidians by
implication, carry with it the fact that they will be treated
in a way different from the way that non-Indians are treated.
?

I think, for example, in what we call 3realla II,
*

?

the second.Prealla Fishing case,
QUESTION;
MR. BAENEN:

Yes.
— where, in concurring opinions, it was

pointed out that State money derived from the sale of fishing
licenses was used in part to replenish the stock that was
involved in the fishing case.
there.
QUESTION:

Yes.

There’s an implicit recognition

29

MR. BAENEN;

We xave c for example., in the Masari

case, ivhere the State is precluded, and a non~Inlian on fee
land is precluded from having a business under State law
relating to the dispensation of liquor within an Indian
reservation, ha is treated differently than somebody outside
the reservation.
There are, in almost every case, I believe, these
implications to be found. But you are correct,

it has not

been raised and addressed as such; which explain;, of course,
the paucity of citations by the State parties.
QUESTION;

We had the case last term, I can't think

of the style of it for the moment, or even the precise issue
in which Justice Biackmun wrote the opinion for die Court,
involving a claim that, a preferential hiring policy for
Indians on reservations violated ---- not -- both rheir
Constitution and their statute.
MR, BAENEN:

Right, Your Honor. That was Morton v,

Mancari.
QUESTION; That's the case we've just been discussing.
MR. BAENEN;

Right, and also cited in our brief.

QUESTION; Right.
QUESTION;

Do you think the equal protection claim is

one that can be raised by the State, or should that be raised
by soraone who claims that he or she is being denied equal
protection?

30

MR. BAENEN:

Your Honor, we debated within our own

office as to whether or not we should raise that as an issue
before the Court. We concluded that the State, as the taxgathering body, perhaps could stand in the position of tax­
payer to raise it.
We do believe that it is an open question. But we
did not challenge it.
I assume that -QUESTIONt

What do you think the source of the

Indian immunity is?
MR. BAENEN;

It’s a jurisdictional source, Your Honor,

based upon the fact that Congress historically has exercised
jurisdiction pursuant to its authority granted br Article II,
Clause 8, Section 3 (sic) of the Constitution ■—
QUESTION?. Well, do you think that — do you — I
take it, you decided to concede that whatever authority the
United States had with resoect to Indians, whether it rests in
the Constitution or in the statute, ought to be exercised
consistent with -the Fifth Amendment.
MR. BAENEN;

Certainly any authority that the United

States has, in terms of Indian affairs, has to be exercised
consistently with other constitutional provisions, just as
the authority it has to raise and maintain armies must be
exercised consistently with other statutory —
QUESTION; And so you didn:t raise the

..ssue?

31
About whether the State could raise this question of
equal protection.
MR. BAENEN:

We didn't raise it* Your

Tonor.

The

court below raised it* sua sponti * by Judge Smith writing
for a dissent.

We believe, frankly* that the State parties

are entitled to a hearing on it.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, ■-*MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel* I

lon't know

how long it will take you to address any other qaestions* but
if you wanted to get back to Montana tonight, an I could finish
in five minutes* we'll leave it to you and to the other
questioners.
MR. BAENEN:

Yoar Honor* I can easily finish in

five minutes.
QUESTION:

If I'll let you!

[Laughter, j
MR. BAENEN:

Yes.

If permitted.

[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:

I have just one question* Mr. Baenen*

I will cooperate in every way with the seemingly consentual
desire of everybody to get you back to Montana.
MR. BAENEN:
here.

Well* that's why * Your Honor* I live

It's —
i

QUESTION:
MR. BAENEN:

Oh* that's right* you live here.
It's my brethren that I want to —

32

QUES TION:

Righ t.

Is there any doubt that the United States could have
brought an action on behalf of the Indian tribes, seeking this
same sort of relief in its own courts?
MR. BAENEN:

There is no doubt in my mind.

It is

our opinion that the United States not only coul1 have brought
the lawsuit;, but that if the Court should determine that
Section 1341 was a bar to the court hearing the ^ases down
below, in light of what has transpired, we belie/e the United
States, in fulfilling its trust obligation to those Indians,
will have to turn around and file the identical lawsuit.
QUESTION5

But that cuts both waysf I suppose.

Because clearly the Indian rights could have bee i vindicated
by the United States, and then there'd b€; no question of the
applicability of the Anti™injunction Act.
When the tribe itself sues, it may not be suing
with all the mantle that is brought, at least wi di respect to
the Anti-in junction Act, when the suit is b rough'; by the
United States.
MR. BAENEN;

That is a distinct possibility.

Certainly if we go back and take a loo]: at the cases
that have interpreted the Anti-injunction Act, which have
canvassed the reason for the enactment of the same, and pay
?
particular attention to, say, the Livingston case, where the
united States was joined in a lawsuit in which the due process

33
— the Morris Company was involved, the lower court had no
problem in entertaining the suit with both parties, made no
effort to say that the due process — that Morris could not be
present, and this Court affirmed, albeit not without — not
with opinion»
However, that case, I think, stands for strong
precedent, that the tribes, particularly operati ig pursuant
to 2 8 U.S.C. Section 1362, the legislative history of which
shows Congress was very intent, because it recognizes the
United States as trustee, has insufficient resources in terms
of personnel and finances to bring all of the lawsuits it
ought to bring to vindicate Indian tribal rights, allowed
Indian tribes, if recognized by the Secretary of the. Interior,
to file lawsuits that the United States could ha/e filed,
QUESTION; Then you are relying on 1362, also?
MR. BAENEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

1362 is a very ~

Do you regard this as providing a

specific statutory exception to the Anti-injunction Act?
MR. BAENEN:

No, sir, I believe that yon have to

read Section 1362 in context with the decisions of this Court,
?
such as Oneida, dealing with the scope and thrust of the
jurisdiction that Congress intended to give Indian tribes.
We have —
QUESTION;
wasn't it?

But 1362 was enacted

when —- in 1966 ,

34

MR. BAENEN:
QUESTION:

In 5 66 or 5 68, I'm not sire.
Certainly long after the Anti-injunction

Act was on the books?
MR. BAENEN:

Correct.

I believe it has to be

construed- I believe it's an imparium in imperio construction
of several statutes, and wa have to — and taking into
account some of the judicial decisions that were on the books
at that time, this Court has dealt, in the case — the first
name of which I can never pronounce — Poafpybitby, holding
that —
QUESTION:

Neither can we I

[Laughter. 3
MR. BAENEN:

—- holding that an individual Indian

can bring a suit, because very often the United States does
not want to because of the conflict of interest, or does not
have time.

And we think that the 1968 jurisdictional ground

under 1362 should be construed as fitting into tie exception
that V7G find affirmed by lower courts and this C rurt in
Livingston, as it relates to the Anti-injunction Act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted..
[Whereupon, at 3:04 o’clock, p„m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.
