MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rupp, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. RUPP, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. RUPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and May it

Please the Court:
The Government petitioned for a writ of
certiorari in this case after the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit had held en banc, with seven judges
dissenting, that Respondent’s reprosecution had been
barred by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The procedural context in which Respondent’s
double jeopardy claim arose is set forth in some detail
in our main brief.
In order to provide a basis for discussion of
the legal principles that we believe control this case,
however, and because the Government's factual statement
does not accord precisely with that relied upon by
Respondent, I should like to begin this morning by
reviewing some of the events that preceded the termination
of Respondent’s first trial.
Respondent was charged in two counts of a

three-count indictment with having conspired to distribute
and with having distributed a controlled substance, LSD.
At the time of his arrest, he retained Jeffrey Meldon to
represent him and so far as appears from the record,
Mr. Meldon continued to represent Respondent without
assistance until approximately five days before the trial
began.

This representation included the filing of several

pretrial motions and investigation into the charges and
the complaint — rather, in the indictment —• of the
circumstances of Respondent’s arrest.
At the time trial, however, Respondent appeared
with three retained attorneys, Mr. Meldon, Maurice Wagner
and my brother. Professor Baldwin.
After the jury had been selected and sworn in
this case, they were excused from the courtroom so that
the Court could hear evidence and argument on Respondent's
motion to suppress the LSD.
In support of that motion, Mr. Wagner called
the Government's principal witness, Steve Cox, the agent
who had purchased the LSD.
As Mr. Wagner’s questioning of Mr. Cox proceeded,
it became apparent that the motion to suppress was without
a factual basis and that, indeed, the theory being relied
upon by Wagner in support of the motion, in support of his
request for a hearing on the motion, would not have

5
justified — would not have warranted the suppression of
the LSD.
The Court therefore became understandably
annoyed with Mr. Wagner, particularly when he persisted in
asking questions of Cox that bore no conceivable relation
to the motion to suppress under any theory.

The Court,

not surprisingly, ultimately denied the motion to suppress.
Since the Government's case rests principally
upon testimony of Steve Cox, the anticipated testimony of
Steve Cox, Mr. Wagner's strategy was to attack Mr. Cox's
credibility.

His aim was to convince the Court that

Mr. Cox's testimony would not be worthy of belief because
Mr. Cox had been involved in some way in an extortion
attempt allegedly directed at Respondent.
The principal problem with this defense was
that there was not a scintilla of evidence linking
Mr. Cox with the alleged extortion, a fact that neither
prevented Mr. Wagner from proceeding with that line of
defense in his opening statement —

was presented.

It was made before any testimony

The Government, Assistant United States

Attorney responsible for the case, made an opening state­
ment of just a couple of minutes on behalf of the
Government.

Mr. Wagner's opening statement proceeded

immediately from that.
We have discussed the substance of Mr. Wagner's
opening statement at pages four through seven of our main
brief and the statement as whole appears in the Appendix
at pages 19 through 29.

I do not think that any particu­

larly useful purpose would be served by my reviewing here
the substance of the statement.
Even a cursory reading of it reveals, we submit,
that the trial court's judgment that Mr. Wagner was bent
upon a conscious course of baiting the court in hopes of
declaring a mi ostrial was not only a reasonable judgment
but very probably an accurate one as well.
After Mr. Wagner had been excluded free- the
courtroom, the court, was informed •—

I understood he was excluded from

That is correct.

QUESTION :

MR. RUPP:

Well, Mr. Waqner had never been

admitted to practice before the Nothern District of Florida.
He had been admitted for the purpose of this trial only.
QUESTION:

So it is just barred, not disbarred?

MR. RUPP:

Yes.

Well, I cannot cite you a specific

It is certainly not inconceivable to me, however,

that misconduct engaged in

by an attorney could reach a

point at which it would be appropriate to exclude the man

I said the building.

Well, from

QUESTION:

Well, why doe3 he have to get out of

MR. RUPP:

Well, it seems to me that the

formulation used by the court in this case to exclude
Mr. Wagner from the courtroom may have been too colorful.
Ills purpose was to exclude Mr. Wagner from
further participation in the trial, which is what he did.

MR. RUPP:

Had he returned to the courtroom, it

is at least arguable that he would have been in contempt
of court.
QUESTION:

You've got a marshal to make sure he

MR. RUPP:

That is correct and on these facts

we submit to you that that was appropriate.
Although, I hasten to add. —
QUESTION:

You mean, every time a lawyer annoys

a judge he should be abolished from the building?
you said all he did was annoy him.
MR. RUPP:

Because

That was your words.

I — what I said was that during the

motion to suppress he had annoyed the judge.

I think there

was good grounds for the Court having admonished him at
that point to proceed more properly.
During his opening statement, however, he was
rendering the trial chaotic at best.

He was refusing to

comply with the Court's very clear instructions.

He

persisted in proceeding with a line of defense which he
knew without any factual basis.
annoyance at that point.

It was more than mere

It was a cumulative series of

events that occurred in this case and they occurred rather
quickly, I will concede, but they seem to me to support
the judgment of the Court that Wagner was attempting to
trigger a mistrial in this case.

9
Now, I do not believe that the Court has to
agree with me on that point in order to find that
Respondent's retrial was net barred by the double jeopardy
clause.

I think, however, that it is a fact.
After Wagner had been excluded from the court­

room, as I said, the. Court was informed for the first time
that Respondent was not prepared to permit his two
remaining attorneys to proceed on his behalf.
The Court was informed of this decision a
second time at a conference in chambers the morning
following Wagner's exclusion.

At the same time Mr. Meldon

for the first time — and not the Court, as has been
suggested by my brother, Professor Baldwin — stated the
declaration of a mistrial might be appropriate.
The session in chambers was suspended to permit
the parties more fully to consider that as well as other
available options and when reconvened Mr. Meldon

did in

fact move for a mistrial on Respondent's behald, explaining
to the Court in a statement which appears at page 41 of the
Appendix that, "Your Honor, I have conferred with the
Defendant

and he wishes to move for a mistrial at this

time and after full consideration and an explanation of
the alternatives before him, he feels that he

would move

for a mistrial and that this would be in his best interestI'
The Court then asked the Government to respond

10

to that motion,

The Government responded, "Your Honor,

we have discussed this et some length and we think that for
the reasons you have already set forth in the record, a
mistrial might be appropriate in this case and the Govern­
ment would not oppose the mistrial."
QUESTION ;

Mr. Rupp, does the record show

whether the alternatives that were presented by the judge
included the possibility of a continuance?
MR. RUPP:

Yes, it. does show that.

At the

session in chambers the morning following Mr. Wagner's
exclusion, the Court not only said the various options
that were available including the continuance, but also
explained rather fully his reasons for having excluded
Mr. Wagner.
Now, the Court of Appeals, the majority of the
Court of Appeals in considering the possibility of a
continuance, concluded that a continuance would not have
been proper in this case because of the Defendant^ —
Respondent in this Court — position that ha would not
permit either Mr. Meldon or Professor Baldwin to represent
him at trial so he would have been in a position then of
having to get entirely new counsel and sufficient time
would have to have been afforded to permit him to get up
the speed on the case.
QUESTION:

It was —
Well, as a matter of fact, when he

11

was actually tried, he tried it himself.
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

Now,that would have

required only a minor continuance.
At the time, though, although the Court knew
that Respondent was a third-year law student, there was no
indication that he was prepared to proceed pro se.
QUESTION:

Well, was Respondent given the option

of electing to have a continuance?
MR. RUPP:

The session in chambers was suspended

to permit them to consider not only the propriety of a
mistrial at that point, but other options.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. RUPP:

The record does not indicate what

was discussed by Mr. Mel don, Professor Baldwin and
Respondent.

I think it is a fair assumption that all

available options were discussed.
What we know from the record is that when the
session was reconvened, Mr. «Me Id on stated that he had
discussed the available options

I assume including a

continuance, though I cannot say categorically — and they
had decided, that is, Respondent had decided that his best
interests would ba served by the declaration of a mistrial
at chat point.
QUESTION:

Yea do have some problem with a

continuance, once a jury has been impanelled, don't you?

12
Because you couldn’t simply go to another jury.

It would

have to be at least during the life of that jury panel
that the case was retried.
MR. RUPP:

That is correct and I don't know

what the life of this jury was, although I perhaps should
add a further point here and that is that the Court was
concerned about publicity that had attended this case,
publicity in the press and at the time that he ultimately
declared a mistrial, he referred specifically as posing, in
his view, a problem.
When this case was called for trial, an abnormal
number of press people appeared and that increased the
judge's apprehension.
So that permitting the jury to go free — that
is, not

sequestering them in this case, would have posed

more serious problems that even the normal case and that is
apart from the problem of the life of the jury..
Prior to the second trial, Respondent moved for
the dismissal of all charges against him on grounds of
double jeopardy and alternatively, to have Mr. Wagner
reinstated. . Both motion;; were denied.
The Fifth Circuit appealed his ensiling,
conviction at a trial in which he proceeded pro se and the
Government's petition to this Court followed.
Although this

Court has repeatedly refused to

13

fashion fixed and inflexible rules to govern the considera­
tion of double jeopardy claims, the decided cases do provide
some guidelines that are responsive to and reflective of
the policy subsumed by the double jeopardy clause.
One of the most fundamental of these guidelines
was that referred to by Mr. Justice Harlan in United States
versus Jam

and that is, that where circumstances develop

not: attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching,
a motion by a defendant for a mistrial is ordinarily
assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the
defendant's motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or
judicial error.
If the Respondent's first trial leave some
questions without a satisfactory answer, they do — they
are sufficient to establish, it seems to me, both the
appropriateness generally of attaching significance to a
defendant’s motion to have his trial ended with a mistrial
and the correctness of the holding here that any barriar
to Respondent's prosecution was removed by.his decision to
move for a mistrial.
The history of the double jeopardy clause and
■ the instances of its application in previously-decided
cases show that the policies

that, the double jeopardy

clause was designed to further conceived of the clause as
a buffer between the state and individual defendants and to

14

protect the individual against harassment and the abuse of
the judicial process.
The clause embodies our commitment to repose
following an acquittal,preventing excessive trials follow­
ing a valid conviction as wall as multiple punishment for
the same offense and maximizing the chances fairly of
resolving criminal charges in a single proceeding.
But this Court has also recognized that the
double jeopardy clause cannot be used to frustrate legiti­
mate societal interests in punishing those, in bringing to
the bar of justice those who are charged with crime and
that the interests of society and of criminal defendants
are, in soma circumstances, best served by permitting
defendants to move for a mistrial and permitting courts to
grant such motions.
In the United States versus Perez this Court
I

held that a second trial would not offend the double
jeopardy clause if the jurors at the first trial had been
unable to agree upon a verdict and in United States versus
Ball ai d United States varso.s Tateo, that a second trial
was permissible if the first trial, if the conviction
at
rendered/the first trial,
was reversed on direct appeal
or in a collateral proceeding.
Permitting a defendant to move to terminate his
trial and giving discretion to

a court to grant such a

15

motion in the face of perceived prejudice is consistent
with these rules and simply acknowledges the unfairness,
the inefficiency of requiring defendants to go forth in
the face of perceived prejudice.
There are limits, of course, and the limits have
been stated in cases such as Gori versus the United States,
Downum, Jorn and so on where the defendant moves from his
trial, retrial is not permitted, if the precipitating
event is attributable to judicial or prosecutorial
overreaching,.

That is, action by the court or the

prosecutor designed to avoid an acquittal by the jury
then empanelled.
QUESTION:

Were either Downum or Gori motions

by the defendant for mistrial?
MR. RUPP:

No, in both of those cases, the mis­

trial was declared by the court sua sponte.
QUESTION:

We have never held in this Court,

have we, after the defendant himself moved for a mistrial,
that the reprosecution was barred by double jeopardy in
any particular* case?
MR. RUPP:

No, you have not.

What you have

said, as I just noted, you have left open a case in which
if there were credible evidence of judicial or prosecu­
torial overreaching, that would present a case in which it
would not be appropriate to attach controlling weight to

16

the fact of a defendant's motion for a mistrial,
QUESTION:
overreaching?

How do you read that language as

As meaning to deprive the defendant of a

very possible favorable verdict from the jury?
MR, RUPP:

That is correct.

It is a sense by

the court of the prosecutor, in my judgment, that the case
is not going well for the side that that person would
wish to prevail and the triggering of a mistrial would
forestall an adverse verdict.
QUESTION:

That is, by deliberate misconduct on

the part of the prosecutor, you mean?
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Could you refresh my recollection

That is correct.

What were the facts in Jorn?

Who moved the

Was that stia sponte?

MR. RUPP:

It was sya sponte ag well, that’s

QUESTION:

That’s what I thought.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rupp, what happened to the rule

right.

that in order to have double jeopardy you not only had to
have the jury, you had to call the witness.

What happened

to that rule?
MR. RUPP:
tried to the court.

Well, that is still the rule in cases
The British rule, of course, is that

jeopardy does not attach until the end of the trial.

The

17
rule in the United States has been since Downurn, since Gori,
that in trials before a jury jeopardy attaches at the
moment the jury is empanelled and sworn, although the
Court has also said that that is the beginning, not the
end of the analysis end I think that is correct.
The wisdom of permitting a defendant to move
for a mistrial in the fact of perceived prejudice and not
requiring him to go to an ultimate verdict would appear to
me to be almost beyond dispute.
As Mr. Justice Harlan noted in the United States
versus Tafceo, "It would be a high price indeed

for

society to pay were every accused granted immunity from
punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute
reversible error in the

proceedings."

It is significant, I think, as well, that from
the standpoint of a defendant, it is doubtful, as
Hr. Justice Harlan noted, that

;he appellata courts would

be as zealous as they are now in protecting against
convictions rendered in part on the basis of prejudicial
errors if they knew that reversing the convictions would
put a defendant beyond the reach of further prosecution.
If retrial were barred following the declaration
of a mistrial but permitted following the defendant's
successful appeal, 1 think that the — what we must expect
is the trial courts would deny such motion in the vast

18

majority of cases and perhaps

for very much the same

reasons as Mr. Justice Harlan and his court felt, that the
result reached in Tateo was necessary.
The majority of the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals expressly declined to hold in this case that the
court's actions in excluding Mr. Wagner were the product of
judicial overreaching.

That is, action by the court

designed to avoid an acquittal.
And Respondent has never contended in this
Court or prior to this time that the Court was guilty of
overreaching.
Although we have not urged this Court to hold
that the exclusion of Wagner was not error, neither is it
at ail important to the position we have taken in this
Court.

That is, that Respondent's reprosecution was not

barred by the double jeopardy clause.
Even if error, the Court's exclusion of Wagner
was not unlike the multitude of ether errors that occur
during criminal trials.
In fact, I should like to note in this regard
that during the conference in chambers the morning following
Mr. Wagner's exclusion, Mr, MeIdon and my

brother,

Professor Baldwin, stated that in their judgment the
exclusion of Wagner had been proper.
Mr. Meldon stated, after spending considerable

19

time looking into the law, "It is my opinion and I believe
the opinion of Professor Baldwin, that the action of the
Court yesterday was well within the discretion of the
Court and. would not be reversed by the Court of Appeals."
Professor Baldwin subsequently informed the
Court, ''After a full night's research it is my conclusion
that the Court's action was propere'*
These are the people, with the Court who were in
the best position to assess both the effect of Mr. Wagner's
opening statement on the jury and they both concluded that
the exclusion of Mr, Wagner at that point at least did not
constitute a reversible error, had not been an abuse of
discretion.
QUESTION:

How much weight do you accord to the

fact that the defendant moved for* a mistrial?
MR, RUPP:

I attach very significant weight to

QUESTION:

Do you think you would have a

that.

different position

if the Court itself had, on its own

motion said, "In view of the circumstances here, I declare
a mistrial"?
MR. RUPP:

Declare a mistrial.

Ultimately, no.

Ultimately I think the same result would be reached.
QUESTION:

What would ba reached now?

MR. RUPP:

Now?

Okay.

If this case were being

20

measured pursuant to a manifest necessity standard as we
argued in our main brief, we believe that the declaration
of a main trial by a court sua sponte at the point at
which the mistrial was declared was justified by manifest
necessity

in the ends of public justice*
QUESTION:

Now, that — and I suppose you would

arrive at that result whether you considered the exclusion
to be error or not.
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

We would arrive at

that conclusion.
I think that the Fifth Circuit, the majority of
the Fifth Circuit fundamentally misconceived the manifest
necessity standard by looking at the circumstances that
existed at the time Wagner was excused

rather than at the

circumstances that existed at the time the declaration of
a mistrial was

being considered.

By definition, if manifest necessity requires a
particular act to be taken, that action is not error, so
we wouldn’t be talking about error at all in this case.
QUESTION:

Lot’s assume that it was error and

then make your manifest necessity argument.

Wouldn’t it

be just that the judge realized that it was error and that
there was inevitable error in the record and that rather
than waste everybody's time and energy and money —
MR. RUPP:

It was best to abort the trial.

Yes,

21

that would be our issue.
QUESTION:

That is what you mean by manifest

MR. RUPP:

Yes, that is correct.

QUESTION:

I gather that manifest necessity is

necessity?

not the same when the defendant moves for a mistrial, say,
as when a prosecutor moves for a mistrial.
MR. RUPP:

No, and this

Is it?

Court recognized that

there is a very significant difference when it is the
defendant who moves to take the trial away from the tri­
bunal then empanelled, the jury then empanelled, and the
court acts sua sponte.
Now, in my response to Mr. Justice White, we
believe very strongly that the manifest necessity standard,
the sua sponte standard, would have warranted the declara­
tion of a mistrial and would not have barred Respondent's
reprosecution in this case.
QUESTION:

Your brother argues that the motion

QUESTION:

But 1 take it your response would be,

even if it was,

because it would lava been quite valid even if there had

MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

23
that is not to say that the motion made by the Respondent
in this case was involuntary.
There were a whole range of options which the
Respondent could have pursued other than moving for a
mistrial.

He could hava permitted Professor Baldwin and

Mr. Meldon, who had represented him until five days before
trial began, to represent him at trial.
QUESTION;

He could have permitted Professox* Baldwin and

Mr. Meldon, who had represented him xmtil five days before

QUESTION:

Let me interrupt you, Mr. Rupp.

Is

the test, under the language of Justice Harlan in Tateo
and Jorn, whether the motion for mistrial on the part of
the defendant is involuntary or not, or isn't it whether
it is in response to the sort of overreaching by the
prosecution that you mentioned a moment earlier to deprive
the defendant of a very possible favorable verdict?
Those are two different things, I would think.
QUESTION;

Yes, they are.

It is — it seems to

me vary difficult to suggest, as Respondents have — and
Respondent has -- and require to do, that the guilty plea
entered by the defendant in Taceo was more voluntary than
the motion for a mistrial entered by the Defendant in this
case.
The guilty plea in Tateo was subsequently found
to have been coerced.

Now, whether Tateo was rightly or

wrongly decided, this is — there is a good deal less
coercion, in fact, no coercion in this case.

24

The Defendant, as I was —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Rupp, whan the Defendant

makes a motion, does that introduce into the scales an
element of waiver?
MR. RUPP:

Well, yes, but it is not waiver —

well, let me back off a minute.

In a number of cases,

this Court has attempted to come to grips with a theory
for double jeopardy cases of this sort and Mr. Justice
Holmes at one point suggested a continuing jeopardy theory.
Other courts have found that a waiver theory
won.Id be appropriate.
I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter appropriately
decided that those were rather arid exercises and what the
Court should be afootit in cases of this sort is looking at
the policies that are subsumed by the double jeopardy
clause.
The circumstances that existed at the point the
mist'“Lai was either declared by the Court sua sponte or
pursuant to a

defense metion and then decided whether the

double jeopardy clause was properly invoked.
QUESTION:

Well, then does that analysis — that

much significance, then, ought net to be attached to the
mere fact that the Defendant made the motion
is to be on the policies -MR. RUPP:

Well

,

if the focus

QUESTION:

— served by the double jeopardy clause

MR. RUPP:

Perhaps.

It seems to me that since

one of the policies of the double jeopardy clause is to
maximize the opportunity that a criminal proceeding will be
brought to judgment in a single proceeding and defendants do
have an interest which we acknowledge in having a cause
determined by a particular tribunal, the fact that the
defendant would move for a mistrial is an indication — and I
think a rather unimpeachable one — that he regards his
opportunity to proceed as overweighed by other considerations
In this case, it was overvreighed by considerations
such as the fact that Hr. Wagner had proceeded to inform the
ju y of a : Ine of dcr'enoe that he simply could not prove and
a;

civil an< a along those ISr.es would have been admissible at

trial.

hat been admonished.

Mr. Wagner

The decision by Respondent in this case

to try again on another day seems to me to have been a
legitimate and reasonable decision under the circumstances
and clearly not coerced.
Now, I

would also like to mention that even if

one concedes that the choice that Respondent had to make in
this case was a hard choice, it was a case that was presented
to him in no small part because of the misconduct of his own

26

attorney.

This is not a case in which a Defendant sat idly by

while events passed him by without him being able to affect
them.

Here it was defense misconduct that brought this trial

to the impasse,

And in that regard, I’d like to bring to the

Court’s attention a recent opinion written by Judge Friendly
ir which he discusses a situation not unlike the situation
with which we have been presented here.
I have given a copy of this opinion, United States
versus Gentile anci L

Pcs in a and I will provide copies to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLETCHER N. BALDWIN, ESQ.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
let me put this question to you,

Before you get underway,

27
Given all the circumstances shown by this record
and the

denial of the motion for mistrial by the judge, do

you think there would have been a pretty good case for
reversal of his action denying mistrial, had a conviction of
guilty followed?
MR. BALDWIN:

Had the Defendant been found guilty,

your Honor/
QUESTION:

That is the only occasion it would arise.

MR. BALDWIN:

And there is no attorney present or

his chief trial counsel has been removed?
QUESTION:

No, no, a lawyer has made a motion for

a mistrial and the judge after considering it denied it and
then the man is tried and found guilty.
MR. BALDWIN:

If, indeed, that occurred in the

instant case and if the judge elected as his option to continue
on with the trial and to force the only other retained counsel,
Mr. Meldon, to proceed, then we would have had a Sixth
Amendment right to question issue — right to counsel issue.
We would not at that juncture have had a Fifth Amendment
double jeopardy question.
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

Well, there would be no double jeopardy

in that case at all, would there?
MR. BALDWIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

But you would have — you say you would

have a good case on — for the judge to grant the mistrial.

20
HR. BALDWIN:

It is arguable that we would have —

at least have a case on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, how would you decide the issue?

MR. BALDWIN:

I am sorry, your Honor, how would

you decide — ?
QUESTION:

How would you decide it?

Would you

have thought it was error to continue the trial or not?
MR. BALDWIN:

I would — I think — yes, your

Honor, it is clearly error.

It struck at the heart of the

Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
QUESTION:

So it is not just arguable and in your

opinion it would have violated his right to counsel.
MR. BALDWIN:

In my opinion it would have violated

his right to counsel and it would appear that this is the

opinion of die on benc court below, the Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION:

So in your view, it is fair to judge

this case — or, we must judge this case on the assumption
that tire judge n.ad commie ted error in excluding the lawyer.
MR., i

jDV.I.U;

:

lour Honor, it would appear that

the heart or this case involves the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel.

It

involves the Sixth Amendment right to counsel

because the only retained

.rial attorney present in this case

was the attorney that was removed.
The Defendant had hired one other attorney, not
two.

He had hired one other attorney to make sure that all

29

papers were filed until he could retain an experienced trial
counsel and this is the heart of the Fifth Circuit's opinion
below.
Mr. Chief Justice and May it Please the Court:
The Fifth Circuit, e;n banc, focused in

upon the

abuse of the trial, process by the judge below and in focusing
in on the abuse of the trial process, the Fifth Circuit
concluded that the court below cut the heart out of Sixth
Amendment right to counsel and that court removed the only
trial attorney available to the Defendant over the Defendant's
objection and not only removed him — as Mr. Justice Marshall
indicated ? but had tvrc marshals gingerly escort him from the
courtroom, from the grounds, and left him off in the parking
lot across the street.
QUFfh’XON

Is it usual in the Fifth Circuit,

counsel, if you know, for them to have a rehearing en banc
and then have no oral argument?
MR.

-iJiLDWI ■;;

Yes, your Honor, that is the common

practice in the Fifth Circuit, to my knowledge.
QUESTION:

Reconsideration en banc but not

rehearing,
MR. BALDWIN:

That is — as a matter of fact, your

Honor, we requested oral arguments an banc and were denied.
The motion was denied.
The Government, in this case, stretches two points,

30
two major points that I would like, in the time that I have,
to discuss.
Firstg that the Defendant, with his second
retained counsel, moving for mistrial or at least the Hobson's
choice, as the court below noted, in moving for mistrial,
waived his right to plead double jeopardy in an appellate
court.
And second, aside from that, and barring whether the:
case involved a waiver or not, assume arguendo it did not
involve a vraiver.

'.‘he doctrine of manifest necessity or the

ends of public justice prevail.
The two major cases that the Defendant will cite
in support of his proposition, aside from the case that I was
giving yesterday afternoon., which I will discuss later, are
Totcio, and Illinois against Somerville, which I would like to
discuss in detail.
In -response tc his first point, the Government
argues that the mist' ial was a direct result of the Defendant's
motion and when a motion by a defendant is made for mistrial,
that assumes to waive any double jeopardy claim that a
defendant, might otherwise

have, regardless of the fact that

there might bo prose tutorial or judicial error.
QUESTION;

Was that discussed before the judge in

chambers?
MR. BALDWIN;

The question of double, jeopardy?

31
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

MR. BALDWIN:

No, your Honor, the question of

double jeopardy was not discussed in. chambers for the simple
reason that we were trying to get the attorney back into
court.

We talked —
QUESTION:

But when you — couldn’t you have said,

well, now, look, I don’t want to make a motion for a mistrial
because I am going to get the doable jeopardy problem.
You could have at least raised it.
MR. BALDWIN:

Although it is net before

you, we did

send the judge a tel igram that afternoon and a telegram to
the Fifth Circuit of the Court of Appeals which was docketed
in the Fifth circuit, 73-1395 and the telegram stated the
Fifth and Sixth. Amendment objections to the —

MR- BALDWIN:

Phafc was before the motion was made.

That was after "• ; 40 p.au on the afternoon of February the 15th,
1973.
The motion for mistrial occurred at 10:00 a.hi.
February the 16th, 1973.
QUESTION:

You 3aY the telegram raised both Fifth

and Sixth Amendment objections.
MR. BALDWIN:

It stated that the judge had created

error and the error would involve Fifth and Sixth Amendment.

32

Although, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we wished to
concentrate upon the right to counsel at that particular time
because, as Mr. Chief Justice Burger noted, initially with
this hypotehtical, double jeopardy was not at issue at that
particular point.
QUESTION:

And when you mentioned the Fifth

Amendment, did you have double jeopardy in mind?
MR. BALDWIN i

Vie had double jeopardy in mind.

We

did not wish to use double jeopardy because this was —• or
at least the Defendant felt, as you can toll by the record,

record if, on the following day, a

motion was made by the defense for a mistrial without raising
any of these sane questions or reservations?
MR, BALDWIN:

the motion made

for mistrial, your

Honor, the following day we argue, was not a motion at all
because there were no options to the Defendant at that
particular point in time.
QUESTION:

Well, where in the record do v/e find

that counsel stated that ?

33

MR. BALDWIN:

Your Honor, throughout the record,

especially page 38 of the record, counsel had time and time
again requested the Court to reinstate Mr. Wagner.
Page 38, the Court indicates that he would not.
QUESTION:

Well, this is long before the motion

MR. BALDWIN:

This is before the motion for mistrial.

Where in the Appendix do we find the

mistrial motion itself?
QUESTION:

MR. BALDWIN;

the Court to move for a mistrial.
It is our contentionv however, that by that time
there was no available option left to the Defendant.
could not proceed farther with his case.

He

He did not. have an

attorney to proceed with the case.
The Court, at. the top of page 41, said that he
would lot reinstate Mr. Wagner, would not let us go to the
Fifth Circuit. Court of Appeals.

He would not allow the

Defendant to continue in forma pauperis.
QUESTION:

hr, Baldwin, on page 38

of the Appendix

when you stated that the court's action was proper —
MR. BALDWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

-— what action of the court were you

34

referring to at that time?
MR. BALDWIN:

Your Honor, when the Court removed
what
Mr. Wagner from the courtroom,/we were focusing in upon was,
how do we get him back in?
And unless we could walk him back in and then have
him arrested, we could think of no way to get him back in.

We

called the Fifth Circuit and asked whether they knew how we
could get him back in.
They said the only way we can think of would be
through an interlocutory appeal which they would not take
unless; the judge — trial judge would join in.
In the alternative, walk him back into....court,
which he would not. do.
Consequently, we threw up our hands and, in effect,
concluded char t> ro is nothing more we can do.

The Court

was proper, at least at that juncture, in terms about trying
to have Mr. Wagner reinstated.
QUESTION:

The whole —

The Court was proper in having

excluded Mr. Wagner ?
MR. BALDWIN:

No, your Honor, that is an unfor­

tunate sentence, at 'east the way it. came out.
QUESTIONs

But it came out the same way from the

other counsel also.
MR. BALDWIN:
felt that way.

That is correct.

The other counsel

QUESTION:

The action of the Court yesterday was

well within the discretion cf the Court and would not be
reversed by the Court of Appeals.
MR. BALDWIN;

My main concern at the time,

your

Honor, and the purpose for the statement was to attempt some­
how to get Mr., Wagner in.

I did not know how to do it.

I

donft know how to do it today.
QUESTION;

Well, the only relevance, so far as I

am concerned at the moment, of what you said then was that
if you and your cocounsel thought that the action of the Court
was proper, how could you. say that — how could you continue
to press for the reinstatement of Mr. Wagner and say you
thereby were deprived ‘-hen the Court denied that renewal of
your isotion °*: 3^. options ?
MR. BALDWIN:
QCeLFTlCON:
proper.

Your Honor -~

You agreed the Court's action had been

That is an aviward way to put it but I think you

understand my point.
MR. BALDWIN;

Yes, your Honor.

Let me go back, if I may, for a moment.

You must

keep in mud that as we spoke — talked in the Fifth Circuit
below

once the —- if I may use the term — the wrath of

the trial judge focused unon Mr. Meldon after Mr. Wagner had
bean removed, on page 33 of the record, the judge said,
"Mr. Meldon, in effect, you

are going out, too, unless you

36
can convince me that you didn't have anything to do with it.
I ara going to treat you the same way I have treated Mr. Wagner,"
And although the Court uses the terms in the
minutes below, "disbarred Mr. Wagner," as the Government
points out, "barring" world have been more proper but the
Court certainly could have disbarred Mr. Meldon.
Mr, Meldon acted or from here •— from the point
page 33 on, when the focus shifted to Mr. Meldon, he acted
under a cloud.

From page 33 on —■

QUESTION1:

Did you say the judge could disbar him?

MR. BALDWIN;QUESTION;

He said he could, your Honor.

Well, there is a

case that says he

c an51, In Re l»b a &.
MR, BALDWIN;
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.

If —

I just want you to remember that.

MR, BALDWIN: •— he could disbar him if there are
circumstancen tdvni would support disbarment.

Disbarment, we

would urgue —
QUESTION;;

Blit Abes says you can't disbar him

without a heari lg.
MR. BALDWIN;
Contempt would

for. must — that is the final resort.

as the Fifth Circuit pointed out, there are

other grounds for punishment of — ways to punish an attorney
short of the drastic act of disbarment.
I would also point out, in response to Mr. Justice

37
Powell's question, that from page 33 of the record on, your
Honor, the Defendant — I'm sorry, Mr. Meldon kept asking to
be removed from the case.

Yet this will be the same attorney

that ultimately will move for a mistrial.
immediately that ‘I don t want to proceed.

He stated
The Defendant

doesn't want me to proceed.”
He was, at that particular juncture, excess baggage,
as it were.
Now, the Government argues that once — that the
trial court was never placed on notice of these other factors,
that Mr. Meldon did not want to proceed, that he wasn't pre­
pared, being t! .

nly other .hired counsel that he could not

proceed and I would point out to you, as the decision en
b:ruo seemed to stress, that this is an ongoing act, that it
wr-.r’ t necessarily at the point in time at which Mr. Wagner
ra>rioved that we focus or that the court focused, it was
the continuing act that culminated in the next morning, in
the removal of the jury by dismissing that jury and what was
the ongoing act?
First, it was the removal of Mr. Wagner, the
afternoon of February the 15th, that would involve Sixth
Av; andment questions.
Secondly, it was the refusal of the trial court to,
one, even consider options as far as the removal was concerned
which goes to the heart of Jora, simply a removal and secondly,

38

when it came ultimately to the court's attention that Mr. Wagner
was, indeed the only trial counsel available, the court
refused Id take additional steps, or any steps, to correct that
initial error.
Now, although the Government says it was unfore­
seeable, it was quite foreseeable because we had a length of
time, at least 18 hours, in which the court could have
considered alternatives to the drastic act of removing that
first jury.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Baldwin, as I read the transcript

or page 41, right before the motion for mistrial or where the
ocv.ri

in chambers the next day, the judge gives the

impression, ai least, of being openminded as to other
possibilities.
He s;ayes, "Have you gentlemen any further thoughts
about how we should proceed in this matter?
And then Mr. Msidon comes forth and says, "Your
Honor, X have coaler rad with the Defendant and. he wishes me
tc move for a mistrial.
MR. Bi&DWiN:

fas, your Honor, that is correct.

record, indicated that he was thinking of moving or considering
moving for a mistrial because the ends of public justice,

MR. BALDWIN:

No, your Honor.

Well, the Defendant

no longer capable of representing the Defendant.
At the ‘cop of the page the court really stressed
its position by saying it would not enter any orders allowing

I would suggest, your Honor, that if, indeed, there
is a question of a valued right such as double jeopardy, that
the trial judge himself in light of the facts — of the
peculiar facts of this particular case, should himself have
conferred with the Defendant as to whether the Defendant
wished to waiva this right,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

41
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Baldwin, you may

proceed,
MR. BALDWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
It is important for me to stress the fact that the
error ir- the instant car;- couldn’t be cured at any time prior
to the dismissal.
The failure o:

the trial judge to cure that error,

the en banc decision states, was the culmination of an abuse
of judicial discretion.
The abuse of judicial discretion was the combination
of the removal of the trial counsel coupled with the refusal
to cor..aider alternatives to that drastic act. when alternatives
were presented to the court and ultimately avoiding the trial.
As the trial court itself noted in its order in
ti>* Petitioner’s appeal page 35a, Dinitz was essentially
without counse1.
Certainly he was essentially without counsel
because the court had just escorted counsel to the parking lot.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the trial judge thought he was
vi everybody in sight agreed with

him,

including the remaining counsel.
MR. BALDWIN:

The trial judge — you are correct,

your Honor, thought he was correct in doing so but upon

42
reflection, when it was brought to the court's attention,
that there are other ways of curing the error, short of
aborting the —
QUESTIONt.

He didn't think it was error.

Nobody

suggested it was error then, did they?
MR. BALDWIN:

No, your Honor, but the experienced

trial judge, X submit, should not have reached the point
where he would have removed the attorney for an act that is
not considered to be very drastic at all.
As a matter of fact, in footnote 11 of the panel
decision below, the majority of the panel concluded that
perhaps it wat a fact distinction between the trial judge, a
feet misunderstand!:'.!*•; between the trial judge find the defense
counsel.
Keep in m:-na that from the record the trial judge

never allowed, the dedense counsel to examine the FBI agents
that he had called ov. proffer.
The jury was out of the room at the time.
On two occasions, at the same point in time, the
defense counsel made an objection.

The trial judge would not

permit the objection to be made.
There is . c way of knowing what the objection
would have been.
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting now that on this

record it shows that the statements made in the opening

43
statement by defense counsel were supportable statements?
MR. BALDWIN:

It is difficult to

say, your Honor.

The —
QUESTION:

I hadn’t thought so, from looking at the

record.
MR. BALDWIN;

There is nothing in the record to

indicate that the ju y was ever apprised of these statements.
The Government very promptly had the jury removed on three
different occasions?

the last time that the jury was

removed [was] never to return.
The statements occurred on proffer when the judge
asked the attorney to nov: present what he was going to tell
the jury.

The only statement that the jury heard was, "This

is the case of the I-credible Witness."
The Cover- ment promptly stopped him from going
further.

The jury was sent

removed.

So there :’.c- no evidence in the record at all,
your Honor, that the jury was infected in any way whatsoever
other than the coming in and out of court on three different —
or two different occasions.
QUESTION:

When the motion for a mistrial was made
V

/

by the defense counsel, would you' agree that the judge was
presented with a dilemma that was not easy to dissolve?
MR. BALDWIN:
QUESTION:

Clearly, your Honor, the judge —

That is indicated by the responses of

44
yourself and your cocounsel expressing the view that the judge's
action up to that point had been correct.
MR. BALDWIN:

The judge, admittedly, was faced

with a dilemma but it was a dilemma of the judge's own
creation.

It wasn't the Defendant's creation.

alternatives at that juncture, your Honor and today, as
far as I can tell, the only alternatives open, which goes to
the Chief Justice's issue of dilemma, was either reinstate
the counsel unless the judge could give clear and convincing
reasons for why he dismissed him in the first place, or, in
the alternative, allow an appeal at that point, an inter­
locutory appeal, to determine the correctness of the judge's
action.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't he continue the trial

as it was?
MR. BALDWIN:

He could have continued the trial as

it was, admittedly and that would not have produced a double
jeopardy issue.
QUESTION;

And if he continued the trial, the

court would hear argument that it would call for an automatic
reversal on the Sixth

Amendment.

MR. BALDWIN;
QUESTION;

I*m sure —

According to your article, is that

your argument?
MR. BALDWIN:

My argument would have to be that

we would hope that that would cause a reversal under the
Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel.

Didn't — didn't —

No.
In the brief time I have remaining, there are two
cases that I would like to focus in upon.

The Government

cites Tateo versus Uni.tec. States as a case that would be
controlling in this matter.
Very briefly, I would like to focus in upon Tateo,
if I may, to tell you it is not similar to the instant case
in that in Tateo, regardless of the courtroom conversation
between the judge and. the attorney, as Solicitor General Cox
pointed out in tie brief for the Government in that case,
tie D« -vendant could rt.il 1 go tc the jury with effective
assistance of counsel.
The Defendant had a choice.

He could have disregar­

d'd the judge's attitude and then appealed the sentence,
assuming he was found guilty, or he could have gone to the
jury and ended it than and there in an acquittal.
The jury had in no way been infected by the state­
ment of the judge to the trial counsel.
Indeed, the only thing that Tateo presents,
perhaps, is the deprivation of s. fair sentence, not the

50

deprivation of a fair trial and as this Court

pointed out

in footnote 11 in Jorn, it stressed in footnote 11 in Jom,
that since Tateo v/as not foreclosed

of options, one going

forward or two, appealing —- one, going forward, the jury had
in no way

been infected.
The case in Tateo is different because in the

instant case, the Defendant had been crippled since his
trial attorney had been removed from the case.
One other case that the —

On the other hand, he had not been

crippled by the opening statement remarks made by counsel.
You have to draw that distinction.
MR. BALDWIN:
your Honor?

He had not been crippled by what,

I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

By counsel's statement, the opening

statement to the jury which the judge found offensive and
unsupported.
MR. BALDWIN;

He had not been crippled by that, no,

So you say the one thing worked to his

The other to his detriment.
Or, the one did not work to his detriment, but

the other one did.
MR. BALDWIN:
the jury and the

The Court very carefully removed

Court did not focus in upon that particular

51
statement when the Court had counsel ultimately removed.
The Court focused in upon the fact that the
evidence was not admissible and that counsel had not
discussed it with the FBI agent.
QUESTION:

Well, was not the statement about the

case of the ’’Incredible Witness" made before the jury?
MR. BALDWIN:
your Honor.

It was made before the jury, yes,

But the Government promptly objected and the

Court in its order, in Appendix A to the Government’s
Petition, does not mention that in any detail but, again,
focuses in upon the FBI and the fact that the defense counsel
v .s

ring to impu<m the integrity of the chief Government

witness in this particular case.
The Government also cites for support, assuming
a .g endo, that ends of public justice are involved in this
cas~, Illinois versus Somerville.
I suggest that Illinois versus Somerville is not
similar to this particular case.
In Iljanois versus. Somerville, the judge found
himself with an .incurably defective indictment.

The

Defendant had absolutely nothing to lose in that particular
case, as the Attorney General of Illinois, William Scott,
pointed out, that under Article 1, section VII of the Illinois
Constitution, the question was now one of jurisdiction.
The judge rio longer had jurisdiction over the case.

52
What did the Defendant have to lose?
He could have gone to the jury.

If the jury had

found him guilty he would have received an automatic
reversal.
In this particular case —
QUESTION:

Well, if the jury had found him not

guilty, I thought that he could have been retried.
MR. BALDWINs

It -— there is doubt in the

Attorney General’s opinion brief that he could have been
retried.

That is, even though it is

So he had that to lose *— the right to

go to trial with the original jv.ry and hope for a verdict of
not guilty.
MR. BALDWIN:

Well, it clearly was a gamble, your

Honor, that ho could not have been found guilty by that jury.
He could have only been found innocent by that jury.
In the instant case, if the Defendant had retained
his trial counsel; if the Court had not removed his trial
counsel, he could have gone to that jury and ended the
matter then and there.
It must be kept in mind that the two distinctions
in Somerville are, first of all, there were no options
realistic in Somerville.

Therefore, Jom, that demands as

the panel suggested below, curable options to be first
considered before drastic action

such as abortion of a

53

trial occurs remains intact.
For these reasons it is respectfully requested
that the decision of the en banc Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals in this case be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Baldwin.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Rupp?
MR. RUPP:

Nothing further, thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.

case was submitted.j
