MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

w© will hear arguments next

in 75-292, the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich.
Mr. Jexrner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT E. JENNER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. JENNER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This is a First Amendment church case, their review
of a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court, which our petition,
w© charge that that decision of that court violated th® First
Amendment, separation of church and state provisions and th®
right of free exercise of religion.
May I say that Mr. Justice Walter Schaefer did not
participate in that decision, having excused hintsel£ because
of the fact that his son-in-law is on© of the partners in our
firm.
Now, what the Supreme Court of Illinois did in this
case — and I will, have to recite some basic facts, I know the
Court has staled th© briefs — but to put the two perspectives
in perspective, that is the issue of th® suspension, th© motion,
removal, and then defrockment of Bishop Dionisij© as to one?
and, secondly, -the reorganisation of the diocese into three
diocese, relating to organisational matters, the discipline of
th® Bishop Dionisije, the discipline area as distinguished from

4
organization area»
Now, the Illinois Supreme Court construed th© consti­
tutions of the church, the mother church, th© Serbian. Orthodox;
Church, and of th© diocese of fch© United States and Canada,
construed the penal code, various regulations of the Serbian
Orthodox Church and mother church, by th® way, all courts have
said who hav© considered this matter, including the Illinois
Supreme Court, is the true hierarchical church,

tod I will

spend no time on that, unless that issue is raised in th© reply

STremmant.
In construing those internal regulations and the con­
stitution, 'fch© Illinois Supreme Court —•
QUESTIONi

Is the Court free to disregard church de­

cisions about that initial question?
MR. JENNER:

It is not, and that is included in the

briefs that we have filed to which I will point, I hope, durtog
th© course of say argument.
The net result of the Illinois Supreme Court having
looked into the regulations, looked into and construed them
differently from the way the Holy Assembly of Bishops, which is
the highest adjudicative authority in the Serbian Orthodox
Church, and held that the defrockraenfe of Bishop Dionisije,'his
suspension in May of 1963, his demotion or removal as Bishop of
the Diocese

in

ths summer of 1963, was arbitrary action within

the decision of this Court in the Gonzalez case, ©f which you,

5
Mr. Justice Brennan, war© tbs author on. behalf of the full
Court.
Sc that the net result of the decision of the Illinois
Supreme Court was to restore as a Bishop of the Serbian Orthodox
Church this suspended, removed and defrocked person.

And as to

the reorganisation of the diocese, the court just says out of
hand, without citing any authority whatsoever, not a single
authority, 'that the Holy Assembly of Bishops, despite the fact
that it is the highest body in the church, and despit© the fact
that only it and only it may create dioceses, and only it may
end a diocese, only it may reorganize a diocese — that is
Article 16 of "the Church constitution — that that was improper
action.
QUESTION;

And only it may create bishops, isn't that

correct?
MR. JENKER:

And only it, as Your Honor has stated,

that is absolutely right, the only body in 'the orthodox church,
it is on® of 14 great worldwide orthodox churches, and only the
constitution provides, the constitution of the diocese, which
is introduced hers as a matter that must be discuss©!, provides
expressly that only the Holy Assembly of Bishops, which is the
same position of the College of Cardinals in my church, in the
Catholic Church, those two highest adjudicative authorities may
only appoint bishops, may remove bishops, and it may only ap­
point diocesan bishops for r. particular diocese and the

6
congregation or parishes or people ia that diocese have no say
with respect to the appointment of those particular bishops.
QUESTION:

And that, is the way this respondent

diocesan bishops became a diocesan bishop, wasn't it?
MR. JENNERs

Precisely, if Your Honor please, that is

exactly the way h© became a diocesan bishop.
So the basic law in this ease — I have a little
trouble arguing this case because they seem so simple to me and
I don't want to oversimplify my argument.

Watson v. Jones, a

decision of this Court in 1871, was the first defended decision
of this Court with respect to this subject matter.
court, in a very deep analysis of the issues

And that

on the Eirst

Amendment, said in substance — I have the —
QUESTION j

Does the case of Watson touch the First

Amendment at all?
MR. JENNER:

You are correct, that. Watson did not

refer to the First Amendment.
QUESTIGF;

I thought you just said it did.

MR. JENNER:

If I said that, then I am sorry.

I

meant to say that Watson v. Jones set down the principles.
Later on, this Court, in Kreshik, held that the 14th Amendment
incorporated the First Amendment to make it applicable to th©
states courts and te the state legislatures.
that misstatement.

And forgive me for

It was an oversight on my part.

Th© civil courts, said this Court in Watson v. Jonas,

7
are limited to accepting the decisions of the highest judica­
tive authorities in a hierarchical church and may not inquire
into the decisions; mad® by those authorities , and once made

they must be accepted by the civil courts.
In Gonzalez, which cams along at a later point, there
was this statement in th© ©pinion;

In affirraing and in adopting

and in reaffirming Watson v. Jones, th© Court said that this
was true except possibly if there are elements of fraud,
collusion or arbitrariness involved in the decisions of the
highest body of the church.
This Court also said that that had very narrow reach,
thergs was no occasion and th® Court did not apply that particu­
lar doctrine for gloss upon Watson v. Jones in that particular
case, nor has this Court done it in any other case.
QUESTION:
MB. JENHER:

So it is dictum?
It is dictum.

It has; been repeated but

repeated as dictum from time to time, in th© cases this Court
has determined, always going bask in every decision of this
Court to Watson v. Jones as the basic case.
QUESTION'S

Would you distinguish in any way between

fraud and collusion on the me hand and arbitrariness on the
other as to the reach of judicial review?
MR. JENR'SR:

Yes, I would, if Your Honor pleases.

if

there — I would t© of this ©pinion, that if there is absolute
fraud and absolute collusion, then I would reach the conclusion

8
that the Court had not exercised the —* that the church authority had not exercised in any respect the rights and privileges
of decision on the merits that it had.

It was engaged in a

fraud and therefore was not functioning as a decision body.
QUESTIONS

But if there was an allegation of fraud.,

would tli© Court be entitled to sit and hear and decide whether
or not there had been fraud?
MR. JENMERs

The Court in my judgment, if Your Honor

pleases, would be entitled to sit and hear whether there had
been fraud to the extent that the church body was not sitting
and exercising its rights and judgments as a church body, so it
hsdnet performed judicially.
QUESTION;
case?

But how d© you apply that to a practical

Supposing the argument is that the Council of Bishops

was deceived becaw.ee on© of the people whom it heard had road® a
false statement?

Now, is that enough allegation of fraud -bo

entitle the Court to review the question of whether the decision
ultimately mad® should he reviewed by the civil court?
MR. JENN'ER:

If Your Honor pleas©, my answer to that

is quite an affirmative no.

I thought your inquiry with respect

to fraud or collusion ifas fraud or collusion in the decision
body itself among its members, that, is they were not actually
exercising their judicial function within the rules of the
church itself.

If there is a fraud on the body itself, that in

my judgment dees not afford the civil courts to undertake to

9
inquire into the matter.
QUESTION%

Really, under your understanding of that

exception to 'the rule? fraud or collusion or arbitrariness,
particularly fraud or collusion/ it is difficult to imagine a
case in the real world/ isn’t it?
MR. JENNERj

It is very difficult, and I think that

Your Honor has put. his finger on it.

It really never would

occur, and that is why I have trouble with that fraud“collusion
and arbitrariness exception.

I certainly don't believe, in

reading all the cases, all the judgments and comments in the Law
Review articles, dolmen, Stokes and the others, I don’t see any
possible way in which it can function in the light of Watson v.
Jones and the Court's repeated affirmance of the principles of
Watson v. Jones.
QUEST 101'!s

Would you think that if you could absolute­

ly prove that the decision-makers in the church had been bribed
to re.-5.ch the decision they did and reached it for that reason,
that it would coins; within the exception?
MR. JESBIER:

I have to say in my cwn heart and mind

that I would find it very difficult not to say that there be
some measure possibly of relief.

But on© of the problems here

is that we in America are thinking in terms of our own due
process, cur own procedures, and we are inclined to impose —
not necessarily impose them», but we think in that fashion when
we are looking at allegations; whereas w® are really not

10
permitted to do that under Wats©a v. Jones, and if these cases
coirs

up involving property — this case involves property only

la the 3©as© that the original complaint filed in this case by
Bishop Dionisij© and his followers sought to enjoin those loyal
to the mother church from occupying the sea in Illinois and
some of the other properties.

This is not a property case in

the sense of title to property, no on© is seeking any title or
trying to grab property, as is stated in the demagogical
fashion in the answering brief in this case.
QUESTIONj

I thought your client, in its original com­

plaint, it requested some sort of an injunction against a bank
where there was some money tied up?
LC IV* • •'

MR. JEMNERj

Well, Bishop FirmiXian, as I recall the

facts, if Your Honor pleases, Bishop FirmiXian, now Bishop
Firmilian — he wsis than a cleric and not a bishop

who had

bean appointed by the Holy Assembly as the — or by tit© Holy
Senate, which is

t'm

executive arm of the Holy Assembly, as the

administrator, pc v.ding disposition of the proceedings with
respect to Bishop Dionisije, he being suspended at that particu­
lar time, and as alleged in that complaint, he had written a
letter to the bank holding one of the bank accounts, requesting
that bank not to honor checks drawn by Bishop Dionisije and his
assistants and followers.
QUESTICKf
MR. JENSQRs

In that sense, money was involved.

It is a form of property, certainly?
It if a form of property, yes.

XI
QUESTION:

Mr» Jenner, you talk©! a bit about what

might happen if there were fraud.

Let*3 assume for the moment

that it was crystal clear under church law, the constitution,
that the governing body, before it could remove or defrock a
bishop, had to afford him what we call a due process hearing,
and assume further that it were equally clear, undisputed that,
no such hearing had been provided.

Would you think that would

come under th© arbitrariness exception in Gonzalez?
MR. JENNER:

I do not think it would coma under th©

arbitrariness provision announced in the Gonzalez case.

The

Holy Assembly of Bishops has th® authority, as does the Collage
of Cardinals in the Catholic faith, to grant that hearing or not
as it sees fit.

The due process concepts of we in this great

country tend to make us feel that that seems very arbitrary.
QUESTION :

But ray assumption was that it was perfectly

clear that church law required a due process hearing, not th®
United States Constitution.
MR. JENNER:
QUESTIOK:

Well ~
Your answer, l suppose, is that the College

of Cardinals or tha equivalent, the Council of Bishops, could
say that is very clear in th® language of church law and we
decided in this case that there is no hearing at all, and that
would be' th© end cf it.
MR.

jenner:

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Because they would have the exelusive power

12
to decide what that meant, and by their action they would have
decided it.
MR. JENNER:

That is precisely my position, and I

believe that is precisely the position this Court took in
Watson v. Jones, which it has been at great car© to affirm very
affirmatively ©very time this issue has come before this Court.
QUESTION;

But that position really boils down to

saying that your client, the diocese comes into court and pre­
sents an injunction and the circuit judge of the county just has
to sign it, no matter what sort of defense the other party might
raise.

If -the bishops want an injunction, they get it.
MR. JENNERs

Only with this gloss, Mr. Justice

Refcnquist, the civil court inquires into whether or not the
appropriate judicial authority in the tiers of hierarchy inter­
preted its church laws, those church laws, those church regula­
tions and matters of that character.
QUESTION?

If it did —

What if it is unclear though to the court,

what if there are conflicting decisions within the church
canonica1 decision?
MR. JENNER;

It is said in Watson v. Jones and other

cases that Your Henors have decided that they generally are
conflicting.

It is amazing, the canons conflict, the penal

codas conflict, various ©ccumsnicals are held and they reach
various decisions, say the bishops assembled and are calling in
the spirit ©£ the good lord, reach the conclusion that Bishop

13
Dionisije should ba discharged, that's it.

Tkay exercised in

their own spiritual good faith, ranched a decision in this
particular hierarchy of th® church and they had the authority
to do that.
QUESTIONS

Well, what if there is a question under

church law as to v?hether th® Council of Bishops or say the
■triennial convention has the authority to do this, can the
civil court decide that?
MR. JENNERs

No.

Ml tha civil court can do is to

look to s©® if the? judicial body having th© jurisdiction with
respect to a particular matter of organization or a particular
matter of jurisdiction has exercised that judgment, absent
fraud.
QUESTION:

But how does it decide what judicial body

has that jurisdiction?
bodies in the church?
MR. JENNIIR:

Suppose there are two different judicial
One comes in and says we decided it —
My thinking her© is there are different

judicial bodies in this church but they are in tiers.
QUESTION:

So you say there is never really any ques­

tion if th© highest judicial body has passed on it?
MR. JENMERj

That is correct, and it is only the

highest judicial body that was involved in this case, th© Holy
Assembly of Bishop?, sometimes called th® Bishops Council,
comparable to the College cf Cardinals.
QUESTION:

There wasn't any —

What if two groups exist and ©ach ona

14
claims it. is fete highest judicial body in that particular
church and on© defrocks a bishop and the other says no* you're
not defrocked# instead ©f that wa are going fe© give you a medal#
you have been such a good bishop.
MR. JENNERs
QUESTION ;
MR. JENNER:

All right.
So what does the court then do?
The closest I can get to that is the

Kedroff case# involving the occupation of the cathedral in New
York City # in which there were two contesting groups, on© was
the members of the Russian Orthodox Church in America# organ­
ised under a New York statute# and the other was the Russian
Patriach# appointed by the Holy Assembly of Bishops of the
Russian Orthodox Church# so there were two contestants as to
who was the patriach.
QUESTION!

But it was pretty clear who the original

and legitimate one was# wasn't it?
MR. JENNERs

It was absolutely clear# and this Court

so held that it was absolutely clear.
QUESTION!.

This is the way th© Episcopalian Church

began in this country# didn't it# a renegade bishop from th©
Church of England!
MR. JENNERs

Well# I am not familiar with that# but I

don't doubt# from my reading of law in this area that other
religious disciplines started that way as well.
QUESTION;

Mr. Jemer, I take it that it is your

15
position that the civil court may go into a determination of
what is the highest juridical body in the church?
MR, JENflER:
QUESTION?

I do.
And this has been held and this is clear,

said I think isn't this the answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s
question?
MR. JENNER:
QUESTION?

I think so.
In any event, that is, you say, not an

issue in this cast)?
MR. JENNERs

Oh, no, clearly it is not an issue in

this particular case.
QUESTIONS

Let me throw another hypothetical at you.

Suppose the determination of dismissal, defrockment, was for a
basis that would not b© toIcsr&fead under the Constitution of the
United States internally in ©ur matters.

Let us say, for

example, that the particular priest or bishop had exercised his
First Amendment rights within the framework of this country in
a way that was unacceptable to the hierarchy and they dismissed
him on that ground.
MR. JENNER:

Is that reviawable?
It is not.

The civil courts must accept

the decision of the highest body of that particular church and
it is not reviewable.
QUESTION?

The only judicial function is to see

whether the particular church followed the rules of the club
when they acted, is that it?

16
MR. JENNER:

1 think that is a fair way of put-ting it.

They might not necessarily have followed literally the Holy
Assembly of Bishops have the sarae privilege that this Court has.
This Court has jurisdiction of deciding a.case, it is not re­
quired to decide it right.

There are allowances for error, and

there are allowances for error in the case ©f the Holy Assembly
of Bishops insofar* as any inquiry of a civil court is concerned.
QUESTIONs

Well, would you concede at all in response

to the Chief Justice's question that the civil court has the
power to se© whether the bishops followed the rules of the club,
as he put it?
MR. JENNERi

I would concede that the civil court has

a right to look into 'the case sufficiently only to sea whether
the Holy Assembly of Bishops in this case in its recital and fee
judgment or otherwise, considered and construed its own rules,
regulations and constitution.

And if it construed them for X

result, that was inimical and hurtful to the bishop or the
person who is on trial, on the other hand, the civil courts in
the United States can't say, well, your decision as t© your
construction of your statutes was wrong.
QUESTION’S

What if the bishops court had said we know

this is what our canon law requires, but wa are not going to
followed the canor law, we are just going to do something we
know if arbitrary, but it is- up to us and that is what we are
going to do?

17
MR. JENNER;

They could do that, but when you us© the

word arbitrary, are you meaning arbitrary in the American sens©
or are you saying arbitrary in the sense here in tha Serbian
Church sensa?
QUESTIONS

Arbitrary in the sens© it is an abandon­

ment of the written rules that should govern them.
MR. JENMER:

I think under Watson v. Jones and
even
*

under Gonzales that that would fc© binding upon a civil court.
QUESTIONs

What content, if any, do you give to

Justice Brandeis in tha absence of fraud, collusion or arbitrari­
ness?
MR. JENNER:

I give —

QUESTIONBecause if yon recall, Mr. Jeimer, that
preceded the principia which you have been insisting upon, the
decisions of the proper church tribunals and. matters purely
ecclesiastical or

acting civil rights, are accepted in liti­

gation bsfor© the secular courts as conclusive because th©
parties in interest made them so by contract, or otherwise.

That

is the general principle.
MR. JENNER:
QUESTION;

That is th© general principle.
But he introduced it with in th© absence

of fraud, collusion or arbitrary — what content did ha mean toy
that, do you suppose?
MR. JENKTiR:
we can do, I suppose —

Well, if may suppose, because that is all

18
QUESTION:

Prom what you have beers, saying, as Mr,

Justice Stewart just suggested, non®.
MR. JENNERs

I don't think he gave — as far as

arbitrariness is concerned, in the sense that we normally consider arbitrariness, there is no moment, and I think the
arbitrariness should certainly be stricken from it.

As to

fraud and collusion, where there is a — where th® decidingbody, as 1 said ©sirliar, becomes so bribed or engages in a
conspiracy of some particular kind, that body is not interpret”
ing its own lav/s.

That body is not making s. decision based

upon the church authorities.

Now, that is what I think h®

meant with respect, to fraud and collusion.
QUESTION:
MR. JENNER:

Is that issue involved in this case?
It is not involved in this case.

No

course, the Illinois Appellate Court, the Illinois Supreme
Court, the trial court, th© trial court found expressly that
there was no fraud, collusion or arbitrariness.

The Illinois

Suprema Court said that in its interpretation of the rules,
regulations and constitution ©f laws of the church, that in its
opinion, by way it interpreted those laws, that the Holy
Assembly of Bishops didn’t follow those laws and therefore
didn't
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, Mr. Jeiuier, that this

is like McCull and Hull, wr- said w© haven't any occasion to
define fraud, collusion or arbitrariness?

19
MR. JENNER:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Are you suggesting that we don't have to

address that here either?
MR. JENNER:

I am exactly saying that; that the Court

doesn't have to address either fraud or collusion —
QUESTION:

Even to go so far as you just suggested;

that at least arbitrariness is meaningless in Mr. Justice
Brandis' dictum, but certainly there is no issue of either
fraud or collusion?
MR. JENNER:
QUESTION:

There is no issue of fraud ©r collusion.
Well, what about arbitrariness, don't we

have to address that?
MR. JENNER:

In contrast, may I suggest, Your Honor,

only to the extent that you say that it is not arbitrary in
this case.
QUESTION:

Well, to do that we have to give it a

definition, don't we?
QUESTION:

Because the Illinois Supreme Court said it

was arbitrary.
MR. JENNER:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

You have to stay cut, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said so many
times, you have tc stay out of this religious thicket.

And may

I just say on© word, because my —
QUESTION':

I think he might have said political, I

didn't recall he said religious thicket.

20
MR. JENNER:

Well? h© may have said that in another

case.
I ask Your,Honors to direct your attention ~ you
will, I know, direct your attention to all issues in this case,
but Article IS, turning to the reorganisation of th© diocese,
Article 16 of the constitution provides expressly that the Holy
Assembly of Bishops may create dioceses, it may reorganise
dioceses, it may end dioceses.
QUESTION:

May I suggest, Mr. Jermer, if you are

right and that we can go no further than t© identify which is
the top decision-naksr for the church, and having decided that,
you say that is not an issue her® in any ©vent.

Having decided*

that, there is nothing then left, 1 would think, of the case
from your approach except this agreement with the Illinois
Supreme Court's definition, if that is what, it was, of arbitrari

aes s.
MR. JENNER:

That is my position, if Your Honor pleas©

and I think well supported by th© cases and especially by the
decisions of this Court.
If 'there are no further questions, I will save what
little time I have left.
HR. CH'HH JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Sullivan.

Very well, Mr. Jenner.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO J. SULLIVAN, III, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SULLIVAKs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
I would like to briefly divide my opening remarks into
three general areas's

One, I would like to address myself to

the division question; secondly, the hierarchical question,
which has been used in this case; and -then, thirdly, the disciplinary proceedings against Bishop Dienisij®.
First of all, w© see the issues in this case as far
as this diocese is concerned as a Serbian corporate diocese,
really congregational in nature, which established a constitu­
tional relationship with the Serbian Orthodox Church in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

And if I refer to the Serbian Orthodox

Church of Yugoslavia from time to time as Belgrade, I intend no
more disrepsect in that, regard than when 1 refer to my own
church as Rome.

£ :> if I inadvertently us© that terra, please

do not feel I intend any disrespect.
Under the terras of the relationship which existed be­
tween the Amaricer.-Canadian diocese and the Belgrade church,
the Belgrade church was to provide the spiritual leader.

The

Ameriean-Canadian diocese, however, was as to its administrative,
legislative and property was — and I am quoting from the
constitution, which was approved by the Belgrade church —- have
full administrative freedom, was to independently rule and

22

regulat©.
Mow 1 quote from the Belgrade church whan it approved
our constitution.

W@ hop© that you have "corap 1st© autonomous

administrative freedom."

It is the only diocese in the Serbian

Orthodox Church which owns its property free; and clear of any
interest by fch© Serbian Orthodox Church.

Its congregations

each have a constitution and the diocese has absolutely no
interest in the property of 'the congregations.
The Americ an-Canactian dioces® controlled itself by
means of a church national assembly, composed of some of the
clergyman and representatives from the various congregations
which they from time to time call a Sebor, and it and it alon©
can amend the constitution.
It is found in the: Serbian Church constitution, not
in Article 14, which says these ar© th© diocese of the Serbian
Orthodox Church, and then lists all th© diocese in Yugoslavia,
but it is found ir Article 15-A, or it was found — it hasn’t
teen found there sine© May 10, 1953, but prior to that date,
Article 15 of the Serbian Church constitution, said in addition
to those diocese in a hierarchical respect is (a) th© AmericanCanadian diocese of th© 'United States of America and Canada.
In 1963, th© Belgrade church called the Assembly of
Bis .-sops, acting within its authority, removed the American —amended Article 15-A, and sine© then the Am© ?icaa-Canadian
diocese has never appeared in its const!‘tution.

In its place,

23

it put three new diocese, the West, Midwest and Eastern.

It

also at the same time in affect attempted to distribute the
property of the three diocese and place three spiritual leaders.
What was the diocsise to do?

Two alternatives.

They could go

along with it or they could insist upon maintaining their own
existence, their own integrity and their ovm property.

They

chose the latter.
The representation has been made that there ar© no
assets concerned here.

There ar© three large pices of real

astata, on® which ~ there ar© incidentally three new dioceses
— on© lying in the East, in Pennsylvania, called Shadeland —
aad I can't recall how many acres, but it has become sort of a
cultural center for Serbs in that area.

It has an old folks

The real estate in Libertyville, Illinois, in Lake
County, which has a cemetery, the body of King Peter lies there,
it has been there

it, under the reorganised plan, is to b®~

com® the horas of the Midwest diocese.

And thirdly, there is &

piece of substantial real estate in California, owned by the
diocese, which they have accumulated over the years.
QUESTION:

Of course, whan you say that the diocese

had the choice of keeping its own property, I suppos© Mr. Jenner’s
argument is that whether or not that was the diocese’s own
property is something that, has to h® decided by the church court?
MR. SULLIVAN:

No, sir.

Th® constitution of the

24
Amerlean-Canadian diocese makes it quite explicit and quite
clear that the diocese owns — I might not foe able to quote it
accurately — owns its own property and it is without rights of
anyone els© in it.
QUESTION?

Well, are you contending then that the

Araerican-Canadian diocese is a separat® juridical entity, that
it is not just a forandi of the Serbian Orthodox Church?
MR. SULLIVANS
sir.

The answer to your question is, yes,

Yes, sir, in th© sense of having its own existence, in

the sans© of autonomously regulating itself, in the sense of
having its own church national Sebor, in th® sense of really
it existed when it. was found by th© Illinois Supreme Court —
QUESTIONS

Well, I am looking at page 25 of the

Illinois Supreme Court's opinion — I mean Appendix 25.
MR. SULLIVANS
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

The plaintiffs argue and th® defendant doss

not dispute that the Sarbiar. Orthodox Church is a hierarchical
and episcopal church, but although the parties agree that in
cases involving hierarchical churches and decisions of th©
proper church tribunals and questions of discipline, faith or
ecclesiastical rule, though affecting civil rights, are accepted
as conclusive in disputes before the civil courts.

Do you dis­

agree with that?
MR. SULLIVANs
but

I do not disagree with all of it, sir,

QUESTION5

Well, do you disagree with any?

Don’t we

hierarchical aspects.

tain that the sol® limitation on this rule, when civil courts
may entertain the kind of review because when a decision of the
church is claimed to have resulted from fraud, collusion or
arbitrariness —

I am in agreement with that completely,

Let me address' myself to the hierarchical distinction, Mr.

Justice, and really it is in rebuttal to what Mr. Jezmer has
said.

Now —
QUESTION;

I thought you have boar, arguing so far

that this is not a case involving a hierarchical church.
MR. SULLIVAN;

Who was it, The. Justice Holmes who

said a word is -QUESTION;

The skin of a living thought.

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION;

All right.

But in this context though, counsel, it is

a little bit like the difference between a corporation and a
partnership, it isn't something that is a part of mythology, it
is a word of art.
MR. SULLIVAN;

Well, it is a word of theology and we

— it is from a different discipline than ours, and our discipline

26
is jurisprudence.

How, w© had l®arn©d clergymen describe what

hierarchical meant, and we cited part ©£ it in our record and
what they said was it is something to do with the ascendency of
a bishop, priest and deacon»
QUESTIONS

It is —

Can, the Midwest group appoint its own

bishops?
MR. SULLIVANs

It could not before May 10, 1963, when

then, prior to the date that they attempted to divide us, prior
to the date that they took us out of their constitution, it had
agree with Belgrade 'chat Belgrade would appoint its spiritual
leader, that is to say its bishop.

But one© they took us out of

their constitution — they had a perfect right to amend us out
— we could not. antand ourselves out because they had to approve
any amendments to ©ur constitution, but they lacked the ability
to amend our constitution.
QUESTION:

Well,, who appoints bishops currently?

Does Belgrade appoint the bishops?
MR. SULLIVANs
QUESTIONf

To the Amaric&n-Canadian diocese?

Yes.

MR. SULLIVAN%

Belgrade does not because the American-

Canadian diocese does not exist in the Belgrade constitution.
It has bean .removed since May of ’63.

They have three different

diocese there.
QUESTION:

Wall, suppose you are right and the

Illinois Supreme Court is right, who will appoint the successor

27
of fch© respondent bishop here?
MR, SULLIVAN2

That will be up to the members of the

Church National Assembly or Sebors,

those members of the

Illinois religious corporation;, which are the congregations
that support it, when they meet in their every three year —
QUESTION:

without reference to the Assembly cf

Bishops in Belgrade?
MR. SULLIVAN:

I think they could choose, if they

wanted they could choose a Serbian bishop.

I think it is up to

them to decide who they will look to now for spiritual leader­
ship, because their administrative leadership and their property
and their legislative authority has always been intact, and they
had it in a smaller form when they looked to the Russian
Orthodox Bishop for guidance prior to 1921.
QUESTION;

Well, have any bishops been appointed in

these three categories now, these three geographical areas other
than by Belgrade authority?
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTIONs

In the three new diocese, Your Honor?

Yes.

MR. SULLIVAN:

No, sir, those ar© three new diocese

which Belgrade has a perfect legal right to have, but they cer­
tain!y are not successors of the American-Canadian diocese.
QUESTION:

My question is who has bean appointing feha

bishops lately?
%

MR. SULLIVAN:

To the three diocese represented by Mr.

28
Jermer, the Holy Assembly of Bishops, at Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
QUESTIONS

Wall, that sounds something like hierar­

chical structure, d©ssa?t it?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir.

In the religious sense,

there is no doubt that the religious sense, as defined by the
religious men that they are hierarchical, because they all say
hierarchical

refers to the flow of sanctifying grace from

bishop to priest to laymen.
What I think is causing some confusion in the case,
now Mr. Jenner compared it to the Roman Catholic Church, and I
am quite familiar with that.

This diocese has never been like

the Roman Catholic; Church diocese, where the real ©state is
owned by the Catholic Bishop of Chicago, and he absolutely has
an obligation to respond to Roma.

This is the roost unique

diocese in the Serbian Orthodox Church, and to say that this is
coldly and flatly hierarchical is to ignore the clear provisions
of the constitution and the practices over the years.

How do

you explain that it is no longer — we never found an Article 14
of their constitution.

The relationship has always been one of

independence over here in America as far as administration and
control of the property is concerned, and w@ look t© Belgrade,
after the Russians finally found us too cumbersome to carry,
for the appointment of the bishops.
QUESTIONx

Wall, it sounds like yon are saying one of

two things, or©, the Serbian Church may b© a hierarchical church,

That may be on® of your arguments.

The other on© is that — the other one apparently is that it
just isn't hierarchical.

What if the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church

and Council of Bishops decides that the Lutheran Church in

32
America is a part of the hierarchy of the Serbian Eastern
Orthodox Church and the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church goes
to court and says we want to take over the following Lutheran
churches?

Would a court be entitled to inquire into that

point?
MR. SULLIVANs

Yes, sir.

I think anyone making ap­

plication to a court for civil court enforcement of a decision
must? on©? demonstrate that we had jurisdiction? and they must
be able to demonstrate it —■ they are going to get civil court
enforcement by neutral principles of law, and you said that and
how the states sat. it up that way, and the churches better get
it together that way.

I think then they would have to demon-

strata that it is a matter over which we had jurisdiction, and
then they would have to demonstrate that there was a good basis
for their opinion, whereupon I think the defense — let us say
they make to® prima faci® — and- there may be some other
elements that they would have to prove, and I think the defense
is available for someone to com© in and say that decision is
absolutely fraudulent, that decision was obtained by the
collusion of three ex-Lutheran members.
QUESTION:

first, Mr. Justice Relinquish.

Is that the issue in this case,

whether or not you are part of the hierarchy or not, or are you
relying mostly on what you were talking there at the end of your
answer, that it is arbitrary or fraudulent?

33

MR. SULLIVAN:

The hierarchical aspects — I call it

the hierarchical blanket drawn over the issues by the petition­
ers.

I believe we, our diocese is not the strictly Roman

Catholic hierarchical diocese, so that fch® class three Watson
v. Jones, paragraph three, Watson v. Jonas hierarchical rule
does sot apply to eur diocese because there are in existence
clear easily read constitutions which involve no doctrinal
disputes by which this question can be resolved.

All

were — we wondered whether or not to make a footnote on federal
i

practice or not.
QUESTION:

I had forgotten it.

MR. SULLIVAN;

We did raise that issue.

W© felt that

the court went as far as it did.
Now* I would like to move to Bishop Dionisije for
briefly.

Bishop Dionisije, a member of the Serbian Orthodox

Church* elevated to bishop, in 1961 they adopted the penal code*
penal procedures.

As an incident in our view to their efforts

to — no matter w!at their motives were, to proceed against

37

Bishop Dionisija, they sought first of ail to suspend him, take
the first step in the penal proceedings, then the second step,
they appointed an administrator who was just to keep the place
from burning down while they proceeded with the penal proceed­
ings .

Practically, there was a great stir i.n the country among

the people because of the division of the diocese, and th©
Sabor, I think it was at the Arson Council, fired off telegrams
to Belgrade and said, look, give Bishop Dionisije a trial, if
he is guilty, h©5s guilty, if he's innocent, he's innocent,
take care of that issue, but as far as this division question
is concerned, we are going to move the Sabor forward and we are
going to find out -- we are going to present this to the
t

congregations who sire still with us.

And, by the way, as far

as we, are concerned, congregations can come and congregations
can go, we have no interest in their property and there isn’t
much we can do about it.
We feel Belgrade acted with a great deal of haste.

A

great many charges and accusations were thrown back and forth,
herasy, heritics, and they were thrown by both sides, a great
deal of mud back and forth.
An investigating commission, whose obligation it was
to come over and follow the rules of the penal procedure com­
pletely and totally, ignored the rules.

They wouldn't show him

the charges, they issued findings of his guilt as soon as they
talked with him.

They knew very well what the outcome, the

38
result would be.

The sum and substance of it was —

QUESTIONz

Would you comment on the point they make

at the end of their reply brief that their action really rested
on his conduct after May 10 of 563 in refusing to participate
and so forth?

Is that a sufficient basis for their action?

Do you understand the point I make on that?
MR. SULLIVAN:
two answers to that.

Yes, I understand the point.

I have

And perhaps the most important answer is

earlier in the brief they say, ahah, the court gave this case
a trial de novo.

They couldn’t do that.

Why, Bishop

Dionisije’s faction retried his guilt or innocence before the
court, and than immediately in their brief they coma back and
say but notwithstanding that, there was still plenty to convict
him on.
But let me answer the second part of that question.
His conduct after May 10th, when lie failed to recognize the
division, sine© every court has held that the division was
illegal, I would find it rather unconscionable to support a
judgment against Lira because he was right.
a tough situation.

I know it makes for

Had they followed the rules and strictly

adhered to the rules, I think their judgment would be entitled
to enforcement by this Court, but as it stands now, since they
didn’t follow the rules, I think this Court has to say I’m
sorry, we ars not going to enforce it.

Nov;, you are not rein­

stating him as a bishop, because there is no desk in the Holy

39
Assembly of Bishops meeting hall for the bishop of the
American.-Canadian diocese.
QUESTIONs

It is gone.

Could I ask you to go back to the passage

in the Supreme Court of Illinois, the opinion that Mr. Justice
Brennan referred to, where it says on Appendix 25, "The
plaintiffs argue that the defendant's bishop does not dispute
that the Serbian Orthodox Church is a hierarchical and
episcopal church.

Moreover, the parties agree that in cases

involving a hierarchical church and decisions of proper church
tribunals on questions of discipline" and so on "are accepted
as conclusive.

All parties maintain that the sole limitation

is the narrowest kind, fraud, collusion and arbitrariness."
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

And then it goes on and decides in your

favor within that narrow exception.
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Now, in your petition for certiorari, do

you challenge that recitation that 1 just read to you?
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION;

No, sir.

No, sir.

So we are accepting -- we judge this case

on the basis that this diocese is part of a hierarchical church?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, in the context by which I

have attempted to explain it, that they look to Belgrade for
the spiritual leadership and always have.
QUESTION:

Well, I just want to make -- you have not

40

challenged in your petition for certiorari this statement that
I read?
MR. SULLIVAN;
QUESTION;

No*, sir, we have not.

Mr. Sullivan, along that same line of in­

quiry , as I understand your position, you do not question the
basic jurisdiction of the mother church in Belgrade to remove
the American bishop?

You do question -- and I understand this

to b© the issue here — the way in which it exercised that
jurisdiction.

You have said that if it had acted properly, it

has the authority under church law to remove the American
bishop.
MR. SULLIVAN;

Absolutely, without — subject to the;

problem, really we have the Bishop Dionisije issue here and,
no matter what the Court seas fit to do on the Bishop Dionisija
issue, the integrity and the fact that we have been thrown out
of the Serbian Orthodox Church still remains, and whether the
civil court seas fit to enforce that decision at Belgrade re­
garding disciplinary proceedings against Bishop Dionisije, it
has nothing to do with the fact that the Illinois religious
corporation still exists and it may now have to look to some™
body els® for spiritual direction.

Mr. Jenner, you have a few

minutes left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT E. JENNER, JR. — REBUTTAL
MR. JENNERs

Thank you, if Your Honors please.

One, the American Canadian dioceses is still a part of
the Serbian Orthodox Church.

It is not a separate diocese.

Mien the Holy Asscanbly of Bishops reorganized the AmericanCanadian diocese, because it was becoming so large and so diffi­
cult to administer as Bishop Dionisije himself pleaded to the
Holy Assembly of Bishops, instead of sending more bishops over,
they divided the diocese into throe parts, the very three parts
that Bishop Dionisije had organized as episcopal divisions.
And in doing so ir. the order, the final boundaries of the newly
established diocese's revision of the existing church constitu­
tion for this territory, in conformity with a newly created
situation, and all other questions relative to the ecclesiastical
organization of these diocese shall be studied by the Church
National Convention here with the bishops in charge and their
motions submitted for final decision to the Holy Assembly of
Bishops„
So what these holy rasa did, exercising sound judgment,

42
said we will create three dioceses here to afford batter admin­
istrat ion, you decide, as stated in this order, exactly what
the boundaries of those three dioceses will be, you review the
constitution of the Canadian“American diocese, and recommend
revisions of that constitution to apply to all three of the
dioceses.

That is what these people in Yugoslavia, these holy

men, said you over in America, we have -trouble understanding
quite what your laws are, but you do it, and that is what was
don©.
Now, secondly, the Illinois Supreme Court, the
Illinois Appellate Court, every trial court -that has considered
tills matter has said teat the effort of Mr. Sullivan’s clients,
Mr. Sullivan is a distinguished Illinois lawyer, to withdraw
the diocese from the archiea1 structure was invalid and that
this diocese is still there pending the ultimate disposition,
now litigation pending for thirteen years, the ultimate de­
cision of affirming the creation of the three diocese as a
reorganization administratively.
Now, lastly, this diocese never had complete autonomy.
The constitution itself says for administrative purposes,
since th© Amer.tear.-Canadian diocese and half a. dozen others
outside of Yugoslavia areg mentioned in the article to which Mr.
Sullivan refers, they have to have special provisions because
we don’t have — it isn’t the dioceses that ar© in Yugoslavia,
and w . are close t.o them, m- may administer to them, w® give

43
you a large measure of administrative independence, but that
constitution provides expressly, and the constitution of the
diocese provides expressly that all decisions of the church
councils here must go to the bishop and b© approved by the
bishop, and he in turn submit them to the Holy Assembly of
Bishops for ultimate approval.

And all decisions with respect

to this diocese and its administration, if the bishop disagrees,
then those decisions made by the Sabers and the councils do not
go into effect until h© agrees or until submitted to the Holy
Assembly of Bis hops and the Holy Assembly of Bishops approves „
So you have this enormous situation of the moment —
and this will only be a few more words — the Holy Assembly of
Bishops being placr
seeking to withdra

in this position, with schismatics
"ram the church, and those holy men in

Belgrade are holding the Arnerican-Canadian diocese as a unit

Bishop Firmilian as the administrator pending the disposition
»f this, this litigation, the Holy Assembly in hopeful defer­
ence to this Court and all other courts until it is finally
decided, it is sort of amorphisy, that the diocese as a whole
jxists pending this litigation, the division of the diocese,
exists to bring eventually the council of the diocese —' it
says council, it doesn't say there in that order that you shall
call Sabers in each of the three diocese, you shall call a

council for the whole diocese, report back to us how you need

you may go on administering with three bishops instead of one
bishop.
