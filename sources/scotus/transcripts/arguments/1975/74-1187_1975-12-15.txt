MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1187, Baxter against Palmigiano.
Mr. Dwight, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD A. DWIGHT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DWIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I am hare on behalf of. the Attorney General of
the S fate of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in the
.case, of Baxter y. Falvnigiano.
This case centers on two issues on two issues,
whether counsel

may si::

a

where bl re in fraction complained of

tjecc of criminal prosecution and, second,

Before I .address those two issues, your Honors,

attack cn the Morris rules because there is
any rule or statute or regulation of the State of

4
Rhode Island which prevents counsel from being present at
these disciplinary hearings.
The rules are clear that an inmate has a right to
assistance by a classification officer or any other individual
authorized by the warden and since the decision of the First
Circuit, attorneys have been authorized by che warden to
be present in these cases so therefore no holding in this
case would held that

statute of Rhode Island or regula­

tion to. be in valid and -QUESTION:

But you are challenging something about

the First -Cir cu.it ' s holding in that respect* aren't you,

that it was n-y ob igation to be .ng this ~}de Island can go right

MR. DTTIGHT
Q’JBdTtON:

It can, your Honor.

t mean, it is only under the compunction

of the First J.ircuit decision, i.sn’t it?
MR. DWIGHT:

Right.

Well, I am not sure I am

QUESTION:

As I understood you, you said that

they now make provision for counsel in these cases.
MR. DWIGHT:

tell, under the compulsion of the

First Circuit.
QUESTION:

But only under that compulsion.

MR. DWIGHT;

Yes, your Honor.

We advised the

warden that there was at the present time — prior to the
First Circuit's decision -- the First Circuit's decision no
requirement that counsel be present at these hearings.
QUESTION:

So your point is, in response to foot­

note one on page 3 of the Government's amicus curiae brief
the
in this case that this was not an attack on /statewide
Morris rules as such,

Is that it?

HR; '0NIGHT
QUESTION-

That is correct / youir Honor.
And that therefore, contrary to the

Government suggestion,

three - -judge court was not required

and that it was properly heard and determined by a single
district judge.

Therefore, the appeal was proper to the

Court of Appeals and certiorari jurisdiction exists in
this Court.

Is that your point”

MR. DWIGHT:
QUESTION:

That is exact:; v correct, your Honor.
End if I understand your reasoning

behind that, you are saying thnh the reason it is not an
attack or, the Morris '-ules is

:hai. out of force of compulsion

you have complied with the First Circuit -

judgment and that

doesn't seem to me to be a very satisfactory reason.
There may be other good reasons why a three-judge
district courr wasn't required bit to say that Rhode Island

6
is now

doin<

something that the First Circuit told it it

had to do, that it wouldn't otherwise do, I don't
know that it is an entirely adequate answer to the Govern­
ment's point

that legal cour se 1 were not required but in no way has there
been any change in any statute

Palmigiano, wio was incarcerated in the Rhode Island Adult

Correctional Institution for murder, on November 11th, 1972,
decided that another inmate needed medical attention and
because it was not being granted quickly enough, he went
around advising the other inmates not to return to their
cells at the time of the 9:00 p.m. lock-up.
He was subsequently charged with — by a
corrections officer with inciting to riot and disruption
and he was told that evening that he might be prosecuted
for state crime.
Two days later a disciplinary hearing was held
pursuant to the Morris rule end at that time, after consul­
ting with his attorney prior to the hearing, he asked that
he be admitted to the hearing.

It is the state’s position that because of these
underlying facts, Wolff v, McDonnell covers the situations
of disciplinary hearing?:: where infractions may also be the
subject of oossible future criminal prosecution.
More specifically, there is a footnote in the
Court's opinion in Wo 1 ff v, McPonne 1.1 which specifically
cites Baxter I and in the body of the opinion, the Court
said that "It is our view, however, that the procedures we

If one looks at Miranda, which is really the
issue here, how far does Mirarda apply, one sees that the
underlying situation there that caused the Court to issue

MR. DWIGHT:

But is is my

position, your Honor, that even in this case that the
inmate's silence was not really held, against him.

It is a

factor and I feel that it is a fact that the disciplinary
board should and realistically will consider but the Morris
rules require that the determination of the disciplinary
board should be based or substantial evidence and the

state

concedes that the silence of the inmate alone is not
substantial evidence and unless there is other independent
substantial evidence, the inmate should not be found guilty
of the infraction.

The First Circuit handed a decision called
Flint v. Mullen in which it made a similar determination
on the question of a suspension hear in a of somebody v?ho had

of course, that is more akin to a criminal prosecution but
the court there decided that, there wan no constitutional

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
HR. FORTUNATO:

Hr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court:

1'c. like to begin by first responding to a question
raised by Hr» Justice Powell regarding the question of
whether or nct the prisoner can absent himself from the
hearing.

My answer to that if no, not when he is charged

with a serious in-prison infraction.

I address myself to this problem at page 11 of
my brief, footnote three.

There was no indication of any sort that, well, why

27
doesn't Ralmiaiano just go sit this one out and we will
proceed accordingly.
I would like to submit to the Court that we seek
no extension of Wolff v. McDonnell in disciplinary hearings.
We are not contending that sufficient time has elapsed from
Wolff v. McDonnell so that this Court may now reconsider
whether circumstances have changed

so that additional safe­

guards should be afforded at the in-prison process.
In seeking the ingress of counsel into these
proceedings we are not asking that counsel he permitted to
cross-examine , to challenge the composition of the board,
to assist the inmates in the presentation of this case as
such. but solely to be there if there is to he interrogation
and if, in fact, a criminal prosecution is threatened.

you can cite to us, that tells us that he must be

;ofc be rued against him.

But I don't think that he

can be compel led — and. this r..s where we ge t the issue of
the compulsion of this custodial interrogation and that is,
Palm.lgiano was told

/es, sure- you can be silent.

He was also, I think,, somewhat misled be being
told that if you speak, it wortt be used in a court of law.
But in an-

event, he was told that your silence

will be held against you if you don't choose to speak.
QUESTION:

that's the matter with that in a civil

proceeding?
MR. FORTUNATO:

Well, I think, as your Honor was,

in. your Tenor's colloquy with las Attorney General, I think
that in a civil proceedings there is no prejudice

of a

constitutional dimension for failure to call a witness

34
forward and certainly, you can comment to the jury, let's
note hare the absence of suchandsuch a witness or somebody's
even
failure to/be present in the courtroom.
QUESTION:

Or the Plaintiff's claim of the Fifth

Amendment when, he is asked a question by defense counsel.
MR. FORTUNATO:

Yes, but I think you have a

qualitatively different situation here when we keep our eye
on the future criminal prosecution and we argue along the
line of Gardner versus Broderick and Lefkowitz that even
though the disciplinary proceeding itself is a civil noncriminal, if you will, proceedings, nonetheless at that point
the tribur.u.l s decision to use his silence as substantive
evidence

against him acted as a compulsion.
QUESTION;

But, Mr. Fortunato, isn't there a

difference between using his silence., the disciplinary board
using h: s silence a -; an inference that the alleged infraction

was, in fact

committed by him and if he is then prosecuted,

using his silence in the criminal prosecution?
Xsr. i there a difference?

NR.. FORTUNATO:

Perhaps I can answer this question

by —
OULsi'IIP •

'1 t there is a differenca, isn't there?

MR, FORTUNATO:

Thera is somewhat of a difference

but I don't, think that it would change my position.

Idiat I mean is —

QUESTION:

You would say that they can't use this

silence either as bearing on whether he committed the
infraction,
MR, FORTUNATO:
QUESTION:

That is correct,

Nor use the silence if later he is

prosecuted for the very same conduct,
MR, FORTUNATO:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Now —

I should think there is a difference

between the two,
MR, FORTUNATO:

Well, what I would suggest is

that the -- I certainly agree with the position of the state
and various opinions of this Court which point out that an
election between two constitutional rights cannot always
leave a person eating his cake and having it, toe.

I mean,

there are penalties that one suffers.
However, I think here if he elects to remain silent
he foregoes, of course, his due process right to speak

in

his own defense,
He may live to regret that decision as a strategem.
He may go to trial, take the stand there, let’s say, in a
self defense: case and get an acquittal.

Maybe he will then

regret that, he spent 30 days in the hole because he didn't
come forth there.

He might even have increased regret, if,

despite the threat of criminal prosecution, no criminal
prosecution is ever brought to bear on him but I do not think

36

that these personal problems he faces are the 3ame as
a constitutional punishment, if you will, by having his —
by being compelled to speak and being in a compulsory
situation in that regard and I think that the cases of
this Court that —
QUESTION:

Of course, our cases have said,

neither judge nor prosecutor at a criminal trial can
comment on the fact that one has not taken the stand.
But what is the fact of life as far as the jury
is concerned?
MR. FORTUNATO:

Well, I would say that the fact

of life is that, despite repeated admonitions from the
Court, if you don't put your client on the stand, you are
in a lot of trouble,.
QUESTION:

Well, are the human beings who com­

pose the disciplinary tribunal any different?
MR, FORTUNATO:

Yes, but I don't think we

should — they are no different, of course.
QUESTION:

However, the

I mean, even if they say to them,

look, we won't use your silence against you.
MR, FORTUNATO:

I think what we have to deal

with, of course, is building our record for standing in
front of an appellate court some day

but the point is

that I think what is ultimately of concern is the inmatds
will and his volition and the fact, in the decision of

3?

Wolff that now the disciplinary board will have to set
forth reasons for the decision so despite the frailties
of human nature they will at least have to consider what
the guard said or what other inmates said or what —■
QUESTION:

But you really have — you don't

say that he needs to be advised that his silence won't be
used against him,

What you object to is the board telling

him that if you remain quiet, that will be used against
you.
MR, FORTUNATO:
QUESTION;

I object to that, yes.

And you say that that is really

compelled.
MR. FORTUNATO:

But you do have & civil proceeding

Wouldn't the role of the .Inmate be an&lagous to

38

criminal defendant can?
HR. FORTUNATO*

Of course, the civil defendant can

always be summoned to the stand by the adverse party.

QUESTION:

No, I am asking as a matter of

privilege question by question rather than simply assert a
blanket privilege?
MR, FOPTUNATO:

The Rhode Isand disciplinary

laws do not *••• the Morris •— so-called Morris rules do
not address themselves to that question.
They dc say that the inmate shall be summoned
before the board and then the inmate shall be interrogated
and they use that specific word "interrogated."
At the hearing itself they said to Nicholas
Palraigiano, "Wall, Nick, what do you vant to say here?"
That's the direct quote and they also then said, "Well,
you're remaining silent.

Are you going to answer any

questions we put to you?*
QUESTION:

Mr. Fortunato,, wo are talking about

a civil proceeding but in this "civil proceeding,K you

MR. FORTUNATO:
QUESTION;
questions?

That is correct, your Honor.

May I come back to some of the prior

Your answers have left me in some doubt as

to youx' position.
Let’s assume for the moment that the rules
require that the inmate be advised explicitly that he had
the right to remain silent and not say anything or to
elect not to answer any particular questions and moreover,
if he were advised that his silence would not be used
against him, would you still think that the presence of
counsel is required by the Constitution?
MR. FORTUNATOt

With one addition, then I would

agree that counsel may not be required, and. that would be
if there were to toe no interrogation of the inmate
because dealing in the closed prison society you can tell
him he can be silent, that his silence won't be held
against him and you can still get into interesting
colloquies with prison officiale either immediately
outside the room or at the board itself in an effort to,
you know, ve don't understand your behavior this time,
Nick, you are usually so cooperative, and we have been
good, to you people, giving you the prison newspaper and
all this sort, of thing.

So

40
QUESTION:

May I add one other condition?

Suppose also that it were made clear that the inmate may
leave the hearing without adverse

consequences.

This

gets back to the first statement you made responding to
your opponent.

I think you said there was no option not

to attend out as I understood what the Attorney General
said, if the inmate made an appearance, he thereafter
could leave,
Now, if the inmate could leave, if ha had bean
advised he might remain silent -- could leave and silence
and departure would not be used against him,

would that

answer your problem?
MR, FORTUNATO;

I think it would because then

we would have no custodial interrogation although the
threat of future criminal prosecution may still hang
over hi& head.

on the assumption that the innate doesn't want to answer

POKTONMJO:

might have conveyed.

X am not saying that in all

situations the inmate may not wish to speak.

I am simply

41
saying that to make that careful distinction as to whether
or not he should forego his privilege, looking toward the
trial and exercise his due process right to speak in order
to perhaps protect himself from going to the hole or some
other in-prison punishment, yes, the lawyer's counsel
would be necessary.
QUESTION:

Going back to the realities as

Justice Brennan, I think, described them, is there any
area of contest, inquiry, whether civil or criminal,
where a defaulting party does not have his default in
reality work against him?

Do

you know of any such area

in —
MR, FORTUNATO:

Wei.;., 1 can only say that there

have been nusaarous instances of acquittal when someone
has not taken the stand.
QUESTIONs

So —•

That may be because of the weakness

of the evidence against him.
HR. FORTUNATOS

But at leact it 'shews that the

jury, upon & proper admonition, can keep that in its mind
so wv>x<

i certainly concede human frailty- I think that

in an effort to support the value of non-compulsion
historically and up to the present day, we should at least
have rules that try to circumscribe :iterations enough so
that compulsion and adverse inferences' will, be minimized,
and l think '-.hat counsel's presence is required in this

instance to do that.
•The distinction that I would .'Like to call to
the attention of the Court is that we proceed here solely,
or seek the intrusion of counsel with our attention solely
rivetted on the trial that looms and is threatened some­
where down tee line and we do not have the same concern
here for a conditional liberty that was present, say, in
Gagnon or Morrissey v, Brewer and because we are in the
Miranda - Mathis situation we contend, we are entitled to
the counsel because of the custodial interrogation and
so our focus is on the future criminal trial and no so
much on getting intruding counsel in here to address
themselves to the issue so that the defendant or the
accused prisoner will not end up in the hole.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the noti.ee to the

inmate who has been guilty of this infraction informs him
that e.n informal hearing will fee held at a particular day
and hour in relation ho the episode that is in question
and that ho may come if he wishes and if he comas, he may
state his position, if he wishes.

But he will not be

compelled to answer any questions,
load then he comes —

take either choice.

Be stays away or he comas and sits silent.

lo

you suggest that on the basis of the evidence of guards
and other inmates he cannot be subject tod to discipline

43
unless he has a lawyer there?
MR. FORTUNATO:

x would add to those admonitions

that you are now the subject of a criminal prosecution.
You have the right to remain silent.
QUESTIONS

How do the prison authorities

necessarily know that he is going to be subject?

Perhaps

he will and perhaps ho will not.
MR. FORTUNATO:

Well, I think that one can

only speculate and hope that, based upon their training,
they will recognise a crime when they see it.
The fact, I think, that we can —
QUESTION:

Well, the crime of — if it is a

crime in the state — of inciting a riot or creating a
disturbance nay be a rather subtle thing in some cases
and perhaps they don't know at that time whether any such
criminal protadu.ce is going to take place or not.
MR. FORTUNATO:

I think the burden there, your

Honor, is tlaarly on the stata that when it brings someone
into ■ custodiul situation, as wo contend this is, that
they hav -e

%

burden of advising him that there is a

threatened cciminal prosecution.
Tha Morris rules so provide, recognizing that
they are -- they do not cover every eventuality.
QUISTION:

Well, go back to the hypothetical I

gave yon. and the man does not come at all.

He elects not

44
to come and they hear the guards and the other inmates
who describe his conduct and then they say, "You are
going to be put in solitary confinement for 21 days."
You say they can*t do that?
MR. FORTUNATO:

No, on that set of facts they

could do that.
QUESTION:

They could do that,

MR. FORTUNATO:
QUESTION:

Yes, they could.

Now, he comes to this informal

hearing and remains in the chair silent.

He is offered an

opportunity to make a statement and he responds that he
does not want to make a statement or answer any questions
and then the;/ proceed to

do the same thing.

Any problem?
4R. FORTUNATO:

Yes.

1 cannot concede that we

should allow prison officials in this position to bring
someone in on your set of admonitions or statements,
elicit possibly self-incriminatory statements
QUESTION:

No, he has not made any statement

in my second hypothetical.
MR. FORTUNATO:
QUESTION:

He has mace no statement.

MR, FORTUNATO:
QUESTION:

Oh, he has not —

Oh, I am sorry.

He is invited to make any statement

he wishes and he answers that he has no statement to make

and that he does not. want to answer any questions*
MR. FORTUNATO:
QUESTION:

There is —

He is mute except for that statement

declining to make any utterance.
MR. FORTUNATOj

There is no problem and if that

had happened in Palmigiano, we probably would not be
here today.
What we are saying is that the evil of the
Palmigiano situation is the circumstances of the interro­
gation and the fact that he was advised silence would be
held against him?

that interrogation was. in fact,

attempted without counsel present.
Sc we have been in the appellate courts and are
here today, in effect, seeking a pro compliance review
with that type of procedure.
Thank you.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Counsel?
MR. DWIGHT:

Yes, your Honor, I would like to

make just two brief points.
RE3UTTAL ARGUMENT 02’ RONALD A. DWIGHT, ESQ.
MR. DWIGHT:

Although it ha® been said that

Mr. Palmigiano was told that his silence would be used

note th .t he was told that it would be detrimental to

his defensa and that the Morris rules provide that, any
finding must be

based on substantial evidence and the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR,. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may continue,

Counsel.
MR. DWIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

P1ease the Court:
I have one last point to make.
The Respondent implied that one would be
entitled to n instruction that a jury must disregard
the silence of s, defendant but I don't think that this
states the

law correctly because in Griffin this Court

stated in -i footnote that they had reserved decision on
whether an accused could require, as in Bruno, that the
jury be instructed that his silence musk be disregarded,
And the Bruno decision res .ad

not on

constitutional grounds but on a federal statute.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1;02 o'clod: p.rn., the case
was aubmitted.3
