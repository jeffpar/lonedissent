MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74-754, United States against
Mandujano.
Mr. Frey, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L« FREY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari
for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
which affirmed the judgment of the United States District
Court suppressing for use in evidence in Respondent's perjury
prosecution the testimony that he gave before a Grand Jury.
In March of 1973, Officer

Cavalier, a San

Antonio policeman who was assigned to undercover narcotics
duties, heard that Respondent was involved in heroin
transactions and on the afternoon of March 29th, he went to
the bar at which Respondent was employed and attempted to
purchase heroin from Respondent.
Respondent made several phone calls to try to
locate some heroin, apparently unsuccessfully, and then
suggested that the officer give him $650 and he would go out
and attempt to procure an ounce of heroin.
About an hour later, Respondent returned to the bar.

4
said he had been unable to procure the heroin, returned the
money but said that his regular connection would be by later
in the day and that if the officer called back later that
evening, he would be able to get some heroin.
The officer did call that evening but Respondent
was out.

He was unable to reach him and he thereupon dropped

the matter at that time.
During the month of April, a Grand Jury was being
planned to investigate into narcotics traffic in the San
Antonio area and in connection with the planning for that
Grand Jury, Officer Cavalier was asked for any suggestions
for witnesses who might be called before the Grand Jury.
Cavalier told the prosecutor about his aborted
heroin transaction with Respondent, noted that he believed
that Respondent had a regular source for heroin and that
Respondent was apparently aware of several other sources whom
he had attempted to call.
Accordingly, the prosecutor determined that
Respondent might be able to provide the Grand Jury with
valuable information about local narcotics traffic.
As the prosecutor later testified without
contradiction at the hearing in the District Court, he held
no intention whatsoever at that time of indicting Respondent
for any narcotics offenses, at least in part because

he

didn't realise that Respondent had committed any offenses.
%

5
Respondent was subpoenaed and appeared before the
Grand Jury on May 2nd, 1973.

At the outset of his

appearance, there was a colloquy between the Prosecutor who
was conducting

the Grand Jury and Respondent, in the course

of which Respondent was three times advised that he was not
required to answer questions that would tend to incriminate
him.
Page 6 of the Appendix, for example, the prosecu­
tor said, "You don't have to answer questions which would
incriminate you*

All other questions you have to answer

openly and truthfully and of course, if you do not answer
those truthfully, in other words, if you lie about certain
questions, you could possibly be charged with perjury.

Do

you understand that?"
And Respondent said he did understand.
Then the subject of a lawyer came up and that
matter was summarized by the prosecutor to Respondent
essentially as follows, "If you would like to have a lawyerfchis is again at page 6 of the Appendix"— he cannot be
inside this room.

He can only be outside,

You would be

free to consult with him if you so chose.
"Now, if, during the course of this investigation
the questions that we ask you, if you feel you would like to
have a lawyer outside to talk to, let me know."
"Yes, sir," said Respondent.

6

"Is that clear?"
And Respondent nodded affirmatively.
Now, in order to lay a foundation for broader
questions designed to elicit the names of drug traffickers
in the San Antonio area with whom Respondent may have had
dealings and to gage the truthfulness of subsequent responses
to those questions, the prosecutor asked a number of questions
covering in part ground already known, including the incident
with Officer Cavalier.
Respondent, while admitting some use of heroin,
denied knowing the names of any local heroin traffickers
except someone whose first name only he could supply —

MR. FREY;

MR. FREY;

Yes, it is at page 5 — the bottom of

Appeals, at page 11a, the warnings that were given were not

Yes, I see, but/we have an issue

whether they were or were not adequate?
MR. FREY:

Well, it is a subsidiary issue if you

get past the question of whether any warning is required, it
would be a question as to the adequacy of the warnings that
were given.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, is there any question that

he didn* t understand what was asked and which he answered?
MR. FREY:

Well, it’s —

QUESTION:

As I read the testimony, he sounds

perfectly capable of speaking English and he did have a 10th
grade education.
MR. FREY:

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, when he was

first told that — you are required to answer all the
questions I ask you except for the ones you feel would tend
to incriminate you.

Do you understand that?

He said, "Do

answer all the questions you ask?"
The prosecutor said, "You have to answer all the
questions except for those you think will incriminate you in
t

the commission of a crime."
I think there is no basis for concluding that he
did not understand, although it is a matter of speculation
what exactly he thought that meant since he, himself, didn't
say back to the prosecutor what he understood it to mean.

I

8

QUESTION:

But I take it he — well, am I correct

in my impression that he had no struggle with the English
language despite his Spanish surname?
MR. FREY s

Not — I think that the Appendix

doesn't reveal any substantial difficulty in understanding,
although, of course, under our argument even if he did not
understand,

that would not be critical to the voluntariness

of the testimony that he gave.
In any event, Respondent admitted some past use
of heroin but he denied having discussed with anyone the past
year the procurement of heroin or having taken any money for
the purpose of attempting to procure some.
QUESTION:

And had Cavalier

I believe that is

his name ■— appeared before this Grand Jury?
MR, FREY;

I believe he had not at that point.

QUESTION;

What did you say the purpose was of

asking him questions the answers to which the prosecutor
already knew?
MR. FREY:

The prosecutor explained that and it

is at page 45 of the Appendix.

He was asked why he did that

and his answer, at the bottom of page 45, "I don't believe we
subpoenaed any witness that didn’t have an existing body of
knowledge about it and in virtually every case we would ask
questions about the facts that we did have."
That was, number one, a method to gage the

9

truthfulness of the person’s testimony and number two, it
was in the nature of a natural progression to result in
answers to the ultimate question.
A simple example of that might be if a person is

a heroin addict, he obviously has to have a source of supply
and you would say, "Are you an addict?" and his answer might
be "Yes," and the natural question to follow that would be,
"Who do you purchase heroin from?"
It seams to me quite logical to establish a
foundation for the Grand Jury’s crediting his

testimony to

cover the background and show the nature of his contacts and
his dealings in the transaction and, of course, we think it
is clear that he 'would not have been indicted, although one
may say that that is speculative, had he cooperated with the
Grand Jury because the Grand Jury was

looking at major

traffickers, the people who were his connections, his sources.
In any avent, he denied, both having talked about
the procurement of heroin and having taken any money for the
purposes of attempting to get heroin and the prosecutor
warned him that according to the information the prosecutor
had, he could tell the Grand Jury more than he was telling
them.

Respondent denied having any further knowledge in this

area.
Prosecutor then was preparing a perjury indictment
against Respondent and in the course of that ha was unclear

10
whether — according to his testimony again — whether they
should be returned in one count or three since there were
three false answers.
He discussed that with another attorney in the
United States Attorney’s office who pointed out to him that
Respondent's actions might also constitute an attempt,, under
the narcotics statute and the prosecutor decided at that time,,
according to his testimony# to add the attempt charge to the
indictment and that was done.
The District Court granted Respondent’s motion to
suppress his Grand Jury testimony# found that Respondent had
been a putative defendant at the time he was called to appear
before the Grand Jury and that# as such, his questioning
before the Grand Jury must be deemed custodial interrogation.
Therefore, the District Court concluded, he was
entitled to full Miranda warnings.

Since he did not receive

the full warnings, the questioning was improper and his
answer should be suppressed from any use including, as here,
from forming the basis of a perjury charge,
'The Court of Appeals affirmed.

It adopted the

finding of the District. Court that the Respondent was a
putative defendant and that therefore his interrogation was
custodial and he was entitled to full Miranda warnings.
The opinion for the Court of Appeals reflects what
we view as a rather disturbing approach toward the function

11
of the Grand Jury and one that we think is quite inconsistent
with the views expressed on numerous occasions by this Court,
While the requirement imposed is simply the giving
of Miranda warnings, the opinion reflects a basic hostility
to the practice of calling as a Grand Jury witness persons
who, according to information in the Government's possession,
have some involvement in the activities under investigation.
For instance, if you look at the Appendix at page
15a, the Court says

this is toward the top —

QUESTION:

This is the Appendix to your

MR. FREY;

To the certiorari petition, that is

correct, I'm sorry.

certiorari

"In order to deter the prosecuting

officers from bringing a putativa or virtual defendant before
the Grand Jury for the purpose of obtaining incriminating
or p&rjurous testimony, the accused must be adequately
apprised of his rights or all of his testimony, incriminating
and perjurous will be suppressed," and at page 19a, "The
entire proceedings here which led up to Mandujuano's
indictment for perjury were, as we have noted repeatedly,
beyond the pale of permissible prosecutorial conduct.

We

conclude that the entire proceeding was a violation of
Mandujano's due process rights under the Fifth Amendment."
The same theme is echoed in the United States
against Wong, which is the Ninth Circuit decision in which
there is a pending certiorari petition.

12
Now, ostensibly,, the Court of Appeals is talking
about cases in which a witness is called for the purpose of
getting him to incriminate himself or perjure himself but the
application of the strong language to the facts of this case
reflect how far its holding really goes in practical
application.
Now, we submit that the approach of the Court of
Appeals strikes at the heart of the effective functioning
*:■

of the investigative Grand Jury.
That body is, in that capacity, attempting to
ferret out secret crime.

How can it do this without

obtaining the cooperation of those parsons who have at least
some peripheral involvement in the criminal activity under
investigation?
In the San Francisco investigation of police
corruption, a parson such as Rose Wong, who was

involved,

apparently involved in gambling activities and thought to
have made pay-offs to police is the very kind of'person whose
cooperation is absolutely essential to the Grand Jury.
Here, a person like Mandujano, who is tied in to
major heroin dealings in the San Antonio area, is a person
whose cooperation is vital to the success of the Grand Jury®s
undertaking.

It should be encouraging rather than dis­

couraging the voluntary cooperation of witnesses such as
these.

13
Now, v?e advance in this case what are, in effect,
five independent grounds for reversal of the judgment of the
Court of Appeals.

The resolution of any one of these in our

favor — and we believe we are clearly correct on all five —
necessitates a reversal»
These grounds briefly summarized are as follows:
First, we say the Constitution is not violated
by eliciting voluntary Grand Jury testimony of any person,
ordinary witness or putative defendant, without warnings of
*

any kind.
Second, we say if some kind, of warning is
required, Respondent received an adequate warning in this case.
Third, we say, Respondent i-/as not, in fact, a
' i"

•

‘

^

putative defendant and the Court of Appeals and the District
Court applied an erroneous standard which would

be very

damaging if the putative defendant notion were allowed to
enter the law of this area.
Fourth, we say, even if the questioning was
improper, Respondent could not answer perjuriously and he
therefore has no remedy in a perjury prosecution.
And fifth, the related contention, this is, in
any event, not an appropriate occasion for application of an
exclusionary rule»

There is no demonstrated basis for

believing that if the court announces a standard for
prosecutors in this area, those standards would not be

14
followed in virtually every case,
Because these points cover a great deal of
ground and because vary little time is available for me to
cover them all, I invite the Court to feel free to interrupt
at any time with, questions about any aspect of the case that
may be of particular interest or concern.
If there aren’t any questions at this point, I’ll
begin with the —
QUESTION:

I got the first three and I was not

attentive to your remaining two,
MR, FREY:

The other two points relate to the

perjury aspect of the case and our contention that even if
the testimony might be suppressible for use in a substantive
prosecution, its perjurious nature means that he is not
entitled to any remedy under the Knox case and Bryson and so
on,
QUESTION:

Yes, that is number four.

MR; FREY:

tod number five is that because any

rule that, the Court announces would likely be followed by
prosecutors because we don’t have the danger of persistent
prevalent abuses in this area, there is no occasion to
apply an exclusionary rule in this instance where what was
done, if wrong, had never yet been declared wrong by an
appellata court prior to the interrogation of Respondent
before the Grand Jury.

15
QUESTION;

Mr. Frey, as long as you are inviting

questions, let me ask you one.

In your brief on page 19 you

say it is common practice for Government attorneys to consider1
such warnings to Grand Jury witnesses who are suspected of
involvement in the criminal activity.
If this Court were to require, then,- a simple
warning, I take it it would not disrupt Governmental practice
today.
MR. FREY;

No, I don8t believe it would disrupt it

and my argument here is that tills is the Supreme Court and
your duty is to apply the Constitution and it is not clear
to me as to the extent of your power to require such a
warning under the Fifth Amendment privilege.
Congress could certainly do it and I don't think
that if it were done that it would seriously disrupt Grand
Jury functioning.
QUESTION;

But the Government does it, not because

it feels compelled by any judicial decision or constitutional
rule, but just as a matter of comity or whatever you want to
call it.
MR. FREY;

Wall, either that or out of an

abundance of caution for fear that if they failed to do it
there might be some adverse consequences such as here
occurred.
QUESTION;

Is there any rule as to when such

16

warning ia omitted?
MR. FREY:

l am not aware.

I

don’t believe there

is any consistent practice and this varies from district to
district depending on the United States Attorney’s office
involved.

Some give target warnings.

Some will tell the

target that he is the target of the Grand Jury.
Of course, that kind of thing wouldn't do any
good in a case like this because we weren’t aware until the
District Court ana the Court of Appeals told us that Mr.
Manduhano was the target — or a putative defendant.
QUESTION:

The warning of which you speak is not

e Miranda warning.
MR. FREY:
to.

Well, that is a point that I would come

We think a Miranda warning would be incorrect.
QUESTION:

Well, my question is a factual one.

‘Ihe warning of which you speak that is often given or some-*
times given is a warning that he may refuse to answer questions
if he thinks they raay incriminate him.
MR. FREY:

Is that it?

Well, I think that is normally the

case but in the Gregory Washington case in which there is a
pending petition before the Court, apparently four - Miranda
v rnings were given.

The Court still found that unsatisfac­

tory because he was not told •—

because that is contrary,
MR, FREY:

Well, but Miranda doesn’t say he has

a right to have a lawyer at bis side.

The Miranda warning

doesn't say he has a right to have a lawyer at his side
during the interrogation.

It simply says you have a right

to consult with a lawyer --

QUESTION:

Which would not be true in a Grand

Jury, as Justice Stewart, suggested.
MR. FREY *

Well, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice,

that the practice is not to have attorneys in the Grand Jury
and I think that is a fairly uniform practice.

The practice

is, when someone has an attorney, to .allow him outside and
to allow him to consult with him,
QUESTION;
in the federal system?

Is this an absolutely uniform practice

IB
MR. FREY:

As far as I know, although there have

been sense haw Review articles that have suggested that
people should have their attorneys in with them in. the Grand
Jury.

There are problems of Grand Jury secrecy and there are

problems under the rules of criminal procedure about allowing
that.
Now, 1 think the main constitutional point in
this case is the proposition that any Grand Jury witness,
whether or not he is a putative defendant, is not entitled
to any advice of rights under the Constitution and he is
certainly not entitled to four Miranda warnings which would,
we say, entail a significant misstatement of his rights.
The opinion of the Court: of Appeals is hazy as to
whether its contrary conclusion is rooted in the selfincrimination provision or the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment.
However, because of the substantial congruity of
its approach with Miranda, it seems most useful here to treat
it as resting principally on self-incrimination as far as the
:ed for warnings themselves is concerned.
In determining whether what transpired in this
ease infringed Respondents self-incrimination rights, it
seems to ms useful to begin with something the Court of
Appeals overlooked, the language of the constitutional
provision itself.

19

”No person shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a. witness against himself."
We wars accused by one of the amictis briefs of
ignoring Johnson against Serbst standard of knowing and
deliberate waiver and addressing ourself to compulsion only.
It is they, however, not we, who have

put the cart before the

constitutional horse for if there is no compulsion there can
be no violation of the privilege.
This Court has spoken on several occasions about
Grand Jury testimony and compulsion.

For instance, in th®

Honla case in 317 U.S. it said a grand jury witness must
claim the privilege or he will not be considered to have been
compelled within the meaning of the amendment and there are &
number of other cases to that effect.
•We submit that this proposition does not alter
simply because the witness is a putativo defendant.

Indeed,

in the Dionisio case, this Court recognized that the
obligation to appear before the Grand Jury, which is the one
element of compulsion to which Respondent was subject, is no
different for a person who may be himself fcs the subject of
the Grand Jurycs inquiry than for any other witness.
The Court of Appeals analogy to Miranda is in
error.

You cannot equate incommunicado custodial police

interrogation with Grand Jury questioning.
I hardly need rehearse the litany of concerns

20

expressed in Miranda that are simply inapplicable to Grand
Jury questioning before 23 fellow citizens who, whatever
else they may be, are surely not so compliant to the
prosecutorJ s wishes that they would countenance the kinds of
interrogativa practices catalogued in Mir ana a; as means of
overcoming the arrested individual's will in extracting a
statement from him.
Moreover, because you have these citizen witnesses
to what transpired and because in many cases including this
you have a transcript of proceedings, you do not have the
problem or reconstructing what happened, the problem of
j

being unable to establish the kinds of improper techniques
that may have bean used*
Moreover, the putative defendant notion is not
useful in making the critical constitutional inquiry into
•compulsion.

The presence or absence of impermissible

compulsion is a determination that turns on the state of
mind of the individual upon the question whether, in the
• vk > •

circumstances, it is likely that his will was overborne.
If Grand Jury questioning is to be equated with
%

incommunicado police interrogation as inherently cohersive,
it is difficult to see why if is more cohersive of putative
defendants than of other witnesses.
Indeed, the putative defense concept really has
no application in Miranda, either, certainly, if you or I

21
ware arrested and taken down.to the back room of the station
house, even if the police had no reason whatsoever for
doing it or simple harassment and weren't planning to charge
us, we would be entitled to Miranda warnings.
Now, let's suppose for a minute that
warning is deemed appropriate.

soei©

kind of

Should it be full Miranda

warnings?
Me think certainly not.

Our raost substantial

objection to the Miranda warnings in the area where we feel
it most significantly misstates what the witness9 rights are
is the absolute right to silence which is suggested in
Miranda.
Mow, analytically, it is not clear where the
right to silence coiaes from.

It is clear, however, that the

police have no power to coraps 1 any one to speak.

They are

not the people in our legal system who are vested with that
power and therefore, in a correlative sense, the arrested
person has an absolute right to apeak since there is no
lawful — an absolute right to remain silent, excuse me,
since there is no lawful power to compel him to speak.
QUESTION?

Well, posed in Hofeldian terms, which,

you know, are kind of out of date, it would be a privilege
of silence rather than a right, wouldn't it?
MR. FREY:

Well, I ~

Privilege of silence which would

22

correlatively be no right on the part of the interrogating
police officer as to a requirement to speak.
MR. FREY:

I think that is right* but I think the

Court’s concern in Miranda is in stating that there was a
right to silence was a more practical concern which was to
tell the arrested person in clear and unequivocal terms —

MR. FREY:

Mow, that is not the case with the Grand

Jury and Branzburg, Caliandra, many cases of this Court
clearly indicate that you do have an obligation to answer
questions before a Grand Jury.

It is the Grand Jury which is

the instrument in our legal system for securing information

Therefore, if anything is to be required, it
would be an explanation — and here it was given, I think, in
clear terms, that you needn’t answer questions where the
answers may tend to incriminate you.
QUESTION:

Would you have the same position if

23

with respect to a person who had been arrested and was in jail
or out on bail and he was called before the Grand Jury?
MRo FREY:

Well, that poses an interesting

question and there are some — I think X would have the same
position, yes.

I mean, let’s —

QUESTION:

You almost must.

MR. FREY:

— take an example.

Suppose that a

person who has been arrested for some offense also happened to
be in a bank when a robbery took placa having nothing to do
with his offense.

Such a person has no right of silence

before the Grand Jury, in my view.
QUESTION:

Well, you changed ray facts a little,

MR. FREY:

Well —

QUESTION:

— say you just wanted to — say you

but —

had just arrested him for a bank robbery and you had to get
him indicted but you didn't want to indite the wrong

fellow,

either so you called him before the Grand Jury and just
raked him whether he might — you would want to be fair to
him and you called him before the Grand Jury*
MR. FREY:

Well, I think it would not be as

irrational to make a distinction in that area as it is to
make the distinction the Court of Appeals made on the basis
of a putative defendant.
After all, Kirby, for instance, recognizes that

24

the right to counsel has attached for an actual defendant»
But I think our position would be that he is not
compelled and he does not have to be given the Miranda
warnings because the Miranda warnings were designed to
neutralize a particular concern and a particular environment»
QUESTIONS

What do you think the rule — the

explanation for the rule at the trial that you may not call
the defendant to the stand at all is?
MR, FREY2
explanations»

Well, I think there are several

One that seems to me most obvious is that the

prosecution as a adversary to the defense could have no
purpose in calling the defendant to the stand other than to
incriminate him so that its purpose is inherently incrimina­
tory when it calls him but beyond-that there.is the problem

Is it possible that in the situation

that Justice Brennan has hypothesised to you# that they
might be inquiring of him about other potential co­
defendants# others who war© involved in the criminal act?
MR. FREY:

Wall# now# there might be.

Now# it is

very likely insofar as th© questioning concerns the crime
and others that he would have available his privilege but I
don't see that our system should be offended by the idea
that if that man comes in and is asked in a perfectly
straightforward way questions that would yield information
about his or others' involvement in criminal activity# I
don't think our system should recoil in any way at that
practice or at using the results of such questions.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Frey,

Mr. Peters.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL ALLEN i ETSRS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. PETERSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of

the Supreme Court,
I would just like to first of all direct the
Court’s attention to the question raised by the Fifth
Amendment due process and that is the compulsion whether
or not in this case Roy Mandujano can be a witness against
himself and in this case I feel that he was.
The question that underrides the whole issue
before the Court is whether or not a Grand Jury ,is_
inherently

coarsive and if

we

look at the facts of this

case, we'll find that Roy Mandujano was subpoenaed,
compelled against his will to appear before the Grand Jury
to ask — to answer specific questions about,that which the
Government already had enough information on'which to base
if,

an indictment.
Number two, when Mr, Mandujano appeared before
the Grand Jury, the special prosecutor informed Mr. Mandujano
that this was a special Grand Jury and the attention that
the Grand Jury was covering was limited to narcotic traffic,
IRS evasions and violations of the gun law and if the Court
will note the Appendix, before they even approached the

29
subject matter of the gun or .IRS violations,, they had pretty
well run Mr. Mandujano through the gamut of questioning
through some 15 pages prior to even going into the
information upon which they already had enough evidence to
indie t Mr. Manduj ana.
Mr. Mandujano, indeed, when he appeared, clearly
the Escobedo rule, which is incorporated in the Miranda,, the
whole focus of the investigation was upon Mr. Mandujano and
the warnings that are recorded in the Appendix clearly are
insufficient in any way, shape or form a® Miranda applies
and I would even urge that in addition to the regular
Miranda warnings that Mr. Mandujano should have been
informed that ha was, indeed, himself the focus of a
specific investigation and on which they already had
sufficient evidence to indict hint6
QUESTIOK s

What provision of the Constitution

do you think requires that?
MR. PETERS: Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist., I believe
that the Fifth Amendment against the compulsion.
against testifying against one's self incorporates that
aspect.

Well, what do you do with oux" Monia

Where we say that if you want to claim the Fifth

Amendment you have to do it before the Grand Jury, that if
you

MR. PETERS:

Well, I would say that Mors la

applies to the normal Grand Jury witness whereas here we have
a special creature, the putative defendant concept.
QUESTIONs

Why

is that differant for purposes of

the Fifth Amendment?
MR. PERTERS:

Well, here a normal, ordinary Grand

Jury witness, when he is subpoenaed to appear — and I would
that
say/even a putative defendant who is subpoenaed to appear
is not entitled to any kind of prewarning until the special
prosecutor or the Grand Jury specifically go into the
actual evidence which they have on that individual and at
that time, than, in this case, Mr. Mandujano will be moved
from the ordinary Grand Jury witness role and placed in a
special category and Mania directs itself to the ordinary
Grand Jury witness and in this case Mr. Mandujano, as the
Appendix points out, and X attempted to clarify in my brief,
he did not know exactly, you know, what his rights were.
He did not understand.

He had an obvious language

problem.
QUESTION s

Is there any indication in Monia that

the witness there was warned or that he had a particularly
clear understanding?
MR. PETERS:

X really don’t recall the facts of

Monia that clearly, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfe.

Well, based on Mr. Mandujano’s ~

the school systems these days, Justice Blackmun, are, you
know, lack a lot to be desired.

However, I think it is

clear from some of the excerpts which I have quoted on page
13 of Respondent’s brief, in addition to which the warnings
and his apparent lack of understanding indicate that he
obviously had a problem with understanding the spoken and I
would assume the written English language from page 18
through pag© 20 of my brief.
I point out. that —

Well, he certainly speaks very well.

He doesn't speak haltingly.

QUESTIONS

Well, take a look at the middle of

page 3,5 where they were cross-examining or examining him
about whether he bought heroin and he answered,"No, air, I
used to shoplift all the time/' having denied that he bought
or sold heroin ever.

That certainly suggests a pretty good

understanding of what was going on, doesn’t it?
MR. PETERS:
QUESTIONS

Well, I would say that the —
Jxxst below mid-page, "No, sir, 1 used

to shoplift all the time.35
And then, "When was the last time you sold
heroin?"
“I haven't sold any sires I got caught."8
Are we talking about the same man, now?
MR. PETERS 3

Indeed we are, Mr. Chief Justice

but I would point out that, you know, here he may have a
partial understanding of some of the questions and some of
the word association but, indeed, when he is asked a simple
thing like, what is the address that he is living, you know,
the special — or ha said, ”2217” and the special px-osecutor
.retorted ”2270” and my client answered "Yes."
And the whole testimony, even though there are
some — and obviously that he had to understand some English,
use of the English language, but I would say his total
awareness and understanding meets a 10th grade-educated

use of the English language is probably very limited arid his

MR. PETERS:
QUESTION:
MR. PETERS:

I would say —
How are you going to get over it?
Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I would

say that my limited experience of understanding the school
system, my wife being a school teacher herself, sometimes
they are put in a position where they pass an individual
just to get him out of their personal classroom and just
advancing him even if he doesn’t grasp or have an under­
standing of such as the English language.

No, Mr. Justice Marshall.

that, in your opinion he has not got a 10th grade education.
MR. PETERS;

Yes, Justice Marshall.

Mr. Peters?

I would say yes, my position would

Miranda addresses itself to this, whether or not you have the

questioning, they must administer warnings, Miranda

understandably waive those warnings, if he so desires,
QUESTION:

So your argument about the 10th grade

education and the possible limitations of Respondent9s
capacity to understand English are peripheral to your central
position here?
MR, PETERS:

I would say, Mr, Justice Powell, that

that is true but the overall argument and the final result
of the Fifth Circuit decision show — and I intend to show —
that this whole atmosphere before the Grand Jury on
Mr, Mandujano was overwhelming and his 10th grade education
is just one aspect of his whole presence and understanding,
QUESTION:

Would your position require us to

examine the facts in each case to determine whether or not
the atmosphere was coercive?
MR, P53TERS:

Mr, Justice Powell, I would say that

it would not be on a basis of a case-to-ease examination of
the individual facts,

I would submit that — and malt© it a

requirement under the Fifth Amendment that a prosecutor
who intends to ask specific questions about the specific
crime in which they could have easily indicted Mr, Mandujano
as well as they did of making him appear under compulsion of
the subpoena and answer those questions,
I would say that under those circumstances in
which they are going to ask any witness questions of the

36

crime itself, that at that point in time he no longed is an
ordinary Grand Jury witness and must be afforded the Fifth
Amendment rights,
QUESTIONS

Is it only the perjury count here?

I mean, this case concerns only the suppression with respect
to the perjury count?
MR, PETERS:

Mr, Justice Whit®, I am not sura that

I understand your question.
QUESTION:

Well, did th© case — he was indicted

on two counts, was he?
MR, PETERS:

Yes, on® for the substantive count

of attempted distribution of one ounce of heroin —

Now, he has been convicted on that,

hasn't he?
MR. PETERS:

And so if we were to

MR. PETERS:

of the Fifth Circuit’s holding, Mr. Justice White, is based
upon the prior concepts of having this individual who is in
the class of a quasi-defendant and —

36
QUESTIONS

There is

bo

doubt about that but if

we were to say, at least to the extent he perjured himself,
it is all immaterial -~
MR. PETERS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
If we were to

say that, then we would

reversa and we wouldn’t have to reach any of the rest of
the questions, would we?
MR. PETERS:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

But as the Fifth Circuit

pointed out, the

totality of ail the circumstances showed that Mr. Mandujano
was definitely — it was just so totally unfair, the whole
procedure, that Mr. Mandujano was involved in that the
Fifth Circuit as well as the District Court, felt, that the
Fifth Amendment should apply and there should be this one
exception to that rule and if this Court — and I feel that
this Court should consider affirming the lower court’s
decision, that the incidence in patting individuals in the
position of Mr. Mandujano, that there should be some sort of
restraint upon the Govermnent in their use and in this
case, I feed, it was a blatant misuse of a proceeding, just
another device in which they can put an individual in an
unfair and certainly a vary uncertain position.
QUESTION;

But even if you are right about the

warnings, that it is unfair of the Government to call some­
one whom, as you describe and the Fifth Circuit describas?

39
is a putative defendant, that doesn't give the man called a
license to perjure himself, does it?
MR. PETERS;

Well, that would apply in all other

cases except the case before the Bar and as the lower courts
have held that there must be some exceptions, consider 'the
analogy of Miranda.

If there is failure to give Miranda

warnings at the time of arrest, statements will be suppressed
and we are asking for the same remedy to compensate and
counter this totally unfair proceeding in which my client
participated in.
QUESTIONS

Well, but suppose you suppress state­

ments where he might have claimed the Fifth Amendment but
did not because you say he dldnst get a warning.

That still

does not go to the questions of whether he — it wasn't a
question of his refusing to claim the Fifth Amendment.

It

was a question of his lying.
MR. PETERS:

Well, ha was put in a position where,

and tha Government readily concedes in a companion, case
arising out of the Western District of Texas, Rangel, they
felt that, indeed, warnings were to be given and they did
not petition this Court to

consider that question because

they felt that Mr. Rangel, because of the implications of
the so-called warning given, that he was compelled and given
the Murphy Waterfront
QUESTION:

trilemma —
Well, was he convicted of perjury, too?

f

40

MR, PETERSi

They did not proceed in either the

substantive nor the perjury count in Mr. Rangel’s case.

I

would say further that* addressing the Court's attention to
the committing the perjury with impunity concept that a
Grand Jury, as in this case* cannot use the fruits of only
[owning?] illegalities and the

as the Fifth Circuit says*

the bringing and asking of these questions upon which they
already knew the answers to just asked for too much on the
part of the credible people to believe that* and X would
point out that the Grand Jury testimony indicates that
throughout the first 15 questions they had sufficient
evidence and they had sufficient background, knowledge to
gage the truthfulness of Mr. Mandujano's answers but they
knew what they were bringing therefore.

They had sufficient

evidence to indict him and as X pointed out earlier* it
doesn't occur until page 15 where they even begin to — and
this is after they exhausted all the normal questions that
the prosecutor normally questions any Grand Jury witness to
establish whether or not he is telling the truth and the
special prosecutor himself indicated in the Grand Jury — or
in the Appendix that the reason he asked these questions
was to gage the truthfulness and that in itself shows you
that they have some sort of — it is not entrapment per se
but it certainly smacks of it* as the Fifth Circuit
indicated in the District Court.

41
I would say that, further, that, since the focus
of the investigation was on Mr» Mandujano and as Miranda
should apply, under the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment, that Mr. Mandujano certainly didn’t knowingly
and understandingly waive any of his rights and that the —

is entitled to# that in this limited case# due to the
fundamental unfairness of the entire proceedings# can
commit perjury with impunity and this Court is not

sanctioning perjury and I am not asking it to sanction per*jury, but I am asking this Court t© affirm the-court's
opinions below based upon the limited instans® where the
proceeding is so totally unfair and the focus of the whole
investigation is upon that individual and that upon that
individual that they have more than qualified whether or
not he was, indeed, telling the truth or not but yet go
beyond that and ask him specific questions about the crime
itself which they knew they had complete evidence sufficient
enough to indict him,
1 would just point out to the Court that if they
had not gone beyond this specific aspect of going into thecrime itself, that then Mr. Manduj&no, if he committed
perjury as to the general information, then I would say that
ha would then be in the status of the ordinary Grand Jury
witness who is not entitled to specific Miranda warnings.
