P ROC E E D I N G B
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Ho» 75-19» United States v. Dcminga Santana and William
Alejandroo
Mr. Easterbrook„ you may proceed.
ORAI, ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTEREROOK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OP PETITIONER
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question whether police can
make a warrantless arrest of a person who they have probable
cause to believe has committed one crime only moments before
and is still committing another crime when that arrest requires
a brief entry into the vestibule of a house.
We submit that the answer to this question is that a
warrant need not foe obtained.
support our position.

Three independent arguments

Two of these arguments 'assume arguendo

that a warrant ordinarily must be obtained to make an arrest
inside a house.
•We argue first that a warrant need not be obtained
when a crime is in progress and the entry can halt that crime.
Second» we argue that a warrant need not be obtained —
QUESTION?

Do you mean when it is in progress or when

it is in progress and that fact is; known or observed by the
officers?

4
MR. EASTSRBROOK:

And when the officers have probable

cause to believe that it is in progress.
QUESTIONS

If just in the abstract, without observa­

tion or without objective fact -MR. BASTERBROOKs

Unless it was known beforehand,

and just simply turned out that it was in progress, the after
the fact justification would not be sufficient.
Our second argument is that an entry should be per­
missible when it occurs within a few hours after a crime and
during a time during which it might be supposed that evidence
might be disposed of.
We submit that the case can be decided upon either
of those two grounds without reaching the general issues of
when a warrant must be obtained to enter a house to make an
arrest.
QUESTION:

Did you say that the second grounds was

it supposed evidence might be destroyed?

Isn't that always

true?
MR. E&STERBRQOK:

Our general argument in that regard

is that during several hours, after a crime, it should ba
reasonable to enter a houses to make an arrest and that the
general justification for that is that evidence might be de­
stroyed during those first few critical hours.

Whether or not

th«are is reason to believe that it would be destroyed in a
particular case is, we submit, immaterial.

The justification

5
of reasonableness extends to those cases as a class and is
not dependent upon the facts of a particular case»
QUESTION:

But is it dependent upon there being some

likelihood that —* welly supposing you have a case in which
the crime involves no other evidence other than just knowledge
or reasonable cause to believe that a person, say, committed a
murder, but there is no evidence — does the evidence have any
bearing on that?

I don't quite follow you»

MR. EASTERBROOK:
understand.

Well, it would be difficult to

Thera is often evidence that a murder has been

committed and that evidence might dissipate.

In the case of

Cupp v„ Murphy, of course, there were fingernail scrapings
under the fingernails, that type of evidence that might dissipate.

But our justification runs to crimes as a whole,

based upon the fact that often there is evidence of crimes.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. ’’ASTERBROOK:

The problem of figuring out whether

there is evidence in a particular case is, we submit, the best
evidence against requiring the officers to figure out whether
there is or isn’t.

It is such a problematic inquiry and it

depends so much upon the facts of a particular case, that it
would be very difficult to require officers or indeed to re­
quire courts to make that kind of determination before or after
the fact in a particular case.
The third argument is that it is always reasonable to

s
enter a home to make an arrest,- with or without a warrant.
QUESTION:

Day or night?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Is that your argument?

Historically,, that has been so,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

I just wondered what your argument was,

what your position was.
MR. EASTERBROOK:
should be settled but

Our position is that that still

it is, of course, not necessary to

reach that, question here because of the two independent grounds
that I have begun to set out and, also because this arrest
took place during the day.

Our primary support of that is

historical, as Mr. Justice Holmes wrote, "A page of history is
worth a volume of logic."

But I do not intend to discuss that

point ffarther, unless the Court has further questions about it.
QUESTION:•

1 have just one.

On both your second and

your third justifications, probable cause that a crime has
been committed by the particular suspe'ct, also probable cause
that he is within the house?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION %

Yes.

Both are required?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Both are required,

The facts of

this case are not complicated.
A Philadelphia narcotics squad officer arranged to
purchase heroin from Patricia McCafferty.

MeCafferry told him

that she would go down to Mom Santana's for the dope.

The

officer recorded the serial numbers of $110 in ten and twentydollar bills and gave the bills to McCafferty.

McCafferty

visited Santana's house, spent a few moments inside and re~
turned to the officer's car with heroin, but without the money.
The officer gave a hand signal to other officers and McCafferty
told him that "Mom Santana has the money,"

The other officers

then drove in their van the short distance to Santana's house,
intending to arrest her for her part in the crime and to re­
cover the purchase money.
When s group of officers drew up in their van in
front of Santana's house, they saw her standing on the thresh­
old of her doorway with a orown paper bag in her hand.

One of

the officers recognised the person in the doorway as Santana,
The officers left the van and ran up the walkway to the front­
door of the house.

There were approximately 15 feet between

the curb and the doorway of the house, so it took but a moment
to reach the threshold.

Meanwhile, Santana had turned, and

retreated into the interior of her residence.

One of the

officers overtook her in the vestibule as she was leaving the
vestibule for the living room of the house,

Respondent

Alejandro was in the living room.
When the officer: overtook Santana, they jostled her
and white packets, packets filled with white powder fell out
of the bag to the ground in the vestibule,

Santana ran from

the living room, attempted to pick up the packets and attempted

8

to flee.

Another officer subdued Alejandro and the arrest was

completed in the vestibule,
QUESTION:

Now, Mr, Easterbrook, you have referred

throughout this; recital of the facts to these people as
officers.

They were not federal officers, were they?
MR. EASTKRBROOK:

That is correct,

hey were of-

QUESTIONS

They were all state officers?

MR., EASTERBROOK;
QUESTION s

Yes.

Does that make any difference?

Because

of Elkins Vo United States, this was as though they were fed­
eral officers, is that it?
MR. EASTERBROOKt

In our view, they must be "judged as

though they ware federal officers..
QUESTION %

Because of the Elkins case.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

Because of Elkins, and. I would add

that Elkins, the companion case, Rios, at 364 U.S. 2.61, and
most recently Cady v. Umhrowski, 413 U.S. 433 and 449,
QUESTION;

So this in the same as though they were

federal officers?
MR. EASTERBROOK5

They Ernst he treated as though

they were federal officers from a constitutional point of view,
and the only question is whether their actiosis comported with
the Federal Constitution.
The packets in the bag were heroin.

QUESTION:

Was there any state prosecution?

MR. EASTERSROOK%

They were originally also arrested

by State authorities.

Oh,, they were.

That8s what you just stated, the facts,

Initially.

And they were charged by State

Approximately a week after the arrest, the Stats

charges were dismissed, so that there is no State prosecution
now pending.

They were dismissed technically without

10

prejudice, but the State authorities, I aw informed, have no
intention of prosecuting.
QUESTIONi

So we don01 have an abate from them here —

MR. EASTSRBROOK:
QUESTION?

Whatever other problems we may have.

MR. EASTERBROOK:
District. Court

There is none.

Although the oral opinion of the

is not entirely clear, the judge apparently

concluded that the evidence would require to be suppressed be­
cause the arrest of Santana was made without a warrant.

The

court recognized that there was in his words, strong probable
cause to arrest Santana, and in our words, absolute certainty
to believe that she was at home.
Moreover, the judge stated that he did not want to
criticize the officers for acting as they did under the extreme
emergency posture of a case like this.

Nevertheless, the

judge concluded, they should have obtained a warrant to enter
her vestibule to make the arrest.
We appealed.

The Court of Appeals affirmed without

opinion.
We begin from the premise that under United Statas
against Watson, decided by this Court on January 26 —
QUESTION:

Excuse me, before you go on.

Did the

District Judge say something about there being no danger of
destruction of the evidence or concealment of it?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

The District Court concluded that

because they found $70 in Respondent Santana9s pockets,, there
was no reason to believe that evidence was to be destroyed.
In our view* this is essentially a faux pas
fcion.

justifica-

The officers had no way of knowing whether they would

find the evidence or not in Mom Santana’s pockets.

The fact

that they did ----QUESTION s

— was the marked money?

MR, EASTERBROOK;

Yes.

The fact that they did find it there was happen­
stance and was something that they could not have known at the
time they were making the arrest.
Under United States against Watson, we believe,
police are entitled to make an arrest without a warrant if they
are where they have a right to be at the time they make the
arrest.

In Watson the police had a right to be in the public

restaurant at noontime, and therefore had a right to make an
arrest without a warrant,
Thera is no doubt that police, like- other visitors,
have the right to approach a house by using the front steps.

Excuse me* Mr. Easterbrook.

X am a little

I am glancing now at the District Judge's oral

colloquy which amounted to his opinion, I guess, did it not?
MB:» EASTERBROOKs
QUESTIONS

Yes,

On page 5 it indicates that not only was

the marked money suppressed as evidence, but also some heroin.

12
MR. EASTERBRGOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

How, what heroin?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

It was the heroin that was found in

the bag that Respondent Santana was carrying at the time she
was seen in her doorway.

And that is the very heroin that she

is charged with possession with intent to distribute.

That is

the focus of the indictment in this case.

Santana had heroin in her possession with intent to distribute
or sell it?

That is correct.

There was no reason to suppress that*, was

there?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That is correct,, there was no rea­

son to suppress that, and it was not suppressed.

The subject-

matter of the indictment relates that she possessed 587 grains
of heroin.
QUESTION:

So you can tell by that quantity.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

That is right.

McCafferty was

paragraph immediately preceding.

is what, the District Judge said„
ME,, EASTEKBRQOK:
QUESTIONS

Ye3, Your Honor,

By way of an opinion, and among other

things, the presence of the money in Santana5s pocket indicates
\

that there was no basis to conclude that it was to be destroyed.
That's the Judge's statement.
MR. EASTS'RBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The predicate for his suppression.

MR. BASTERBROOK:

That was part of his reason for

suppressing the evidence.
QUESTION;

Does he anywhere else, or is there any

other explanation of why he thought it could not have been
destroyed five minutes later if she had locked the door?
MR. BASTERBROOK;

There is no other statement .ex­

cept that.
QUESTION:

Or concealed?

MR. BASTERBROOK;

None other, Your Honor, except the

fact that it was in her pockets at the time of the arrest,
which was approximately two or three minutes after the sale,
and at that point, as I have pointed out, $40 of the money was
already gone; $70 was recovered.
QUESTION;

Thank you.

MR. BASTERBROOK;
QUESTION;

The problem here —

The District Judge did not make any

reference; to disposition of the heroin, at least that 1

15
observed, or dici he at some point?
MR. E&STSKBROOK :

He did on tbs last, page of his oral

opinion, on page 5(a)# the second paragraph from the end.

The

Court believes that the heroin that supports Count 2 and 3
should bo suppressed and not offered as evidence.
QUESTIONS

Wellt should be suppressed — that could

have been put down the drain very quickly.
MR. UASTERBROOKs

Oh, that is correct? he never- makes

any statement that there was, that the officers knew or did not
know whether that was to ba destroyed.

I think it is implicit

in his opinion that the officers did not know' that it was soon
to be destroyed.
We think the problem here is whether the policer
who were entitled to approach Santana as she stood in her door­
way, were required to stop., turn back and seek a warrant be­
cause Santana retreated from the threshold of her doorway to
her vestibule.

The consequences of a sudden stop would have

bean considerable.

Respondents would have been afforded a

respite of an hour or more while the warrant was being obtained,,
There would have been ample time then to destroy the heroin and
the money which, having seen the officers coming —
QUESTION?

Could it ba fair to say the Judge said

that before you moved the van, you should have gone and gotten
the warrant?
MR. EAST2RBR0OK:

I think that is another possible

16

interpretation.

My understanding of the oral argument in the

Court, of Appeals is that at least one of the Judges of the
Court of Appeals expressed that view, and if that is the cor­
rect view of this case, we submit that it is not because the
officers were entitled to approach Santana as she stood in her
doorway without a warrant, and Respondents do not seriously
contest that, but if it is the correct view of the case, the
arguments that we make hers are unaffected.

If was still true

that the police believed that she was committing the crime of
possession of heroin and it was still true that the arrest was
quite prompt after she had committed the crime of distributing
heroin to KcCafferty, and I will now turn to our —
QUESTION;

Just one small point.

Is it correct that

your theory is that they had probable cause to believe she

QUESTIONs

MR. EASTERBROOK;

We believe that it is reasonable

from a house in an operation of this sort had not sold it all.

17
QUESTIONS

1 see.

MR. EASTERBROQKs

it is essentially a question of com­

mon experience.
The most general justification for the arrest in
order to put a stop to the continuing crime was articulated by
Mr. Justice Marshall in Watson.

He wrote?

"When law enforce­

ment officers have probable cause to believe that an offense
is taking place in their presence and that the suspect is at
that moment in possession of the evidence, exigent circum­
stances exist»

Delay could cause escape of the suspect or

'destruction of the evidence*M

That fits this case exactly.

The officers held probable cause to believe that
Santana was engaged in the crime of possession of heroin with
intent to distribute it, and that she possessed not only the
heroin but the evidence of another crime, her pervious sale of
heroin to McCafforty.

They were therefore entitled to make a

prompt arrest even though that involved an entry into her
vestibule„
QUESTION?

Do you think it. was necessary they had

probable cause to believe that the heroin was on her person?
MR. EASTERSROOK:

We donsfc believe so, Your Honor.

They had probable cause to arrest liar for that crime.

There

would be some difficulties in this case —
QUESTIONs

Well, lefch assume they had probable cause

to believe that she had heroin somewhere in the house but not

We believe that they could make the

There would, in our view -QUEST10N:

And enter the vestibule?

MR. EASTERSROOKi

And enter the vestibule.

There

would be difficulties if they then attempted to search the
house for the heroin that they had probable cause to believe
was there.

We believe they would at that point be required to

desist, and if the heroin was not within the reach of her or on
her person, to obtain a warrant to search the house for the
heroin that they had probable cause to believe was there*
QUESTIONi

Well, except its being on her person or in

plain view, they would ha required to get a warrant, would they
not?
MR. EASTSRBROOKs
QUESTION t

with a warrant.
MR. SASTERBROOKs

Unless they had reason to believe

that there were other people in the house.
QUESTION?

For example —

Well, I am just assuming —

MR. SASTERBROOKs-

— assuming that they had already-

arrested everyone in the house.
QUESTION:

We will resume at ons o*clock.

19
AFTERNOON SESSION - Is 00 O’CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. EASTERBROOK;

Mr. Easterbrook.

I would like to expand upon my

answers to two of Mr. Justice Stewart’s questions.
You inquired, Mr. Justice Stewart, about the nature
of the indictment in this case anti the indictment is indeed,
as I indicated, for the possession of the heroin that was in
the bag.

The United States Attorney informed me that that

indictment was returned because Patricia McCafferty, whose
testimony would have been perhaps necessary for proof of the
sale to McCafferty

had indicated that she was unwilling to

testify against Santana, and therefore the decision was made
to indict her for the possession with intent to distribute the
heroin in. the bag.
The second question had to do with whether our
position was that you could make a warrantless arrest entry
at night.

Row, I indicated that our position was that.

I

should expand by saying that we believe that historically no
warrant has been required and none, should be required, but
the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies
in full force, and it could and usually would be unreasonable
to make a nighttime entry if a daytime entry would do as well
to make an arrest.
So that we do not want to leave the impression that
nighttime entries are a preferable or indeed unquestioned way

20

of making such arrests; they are not,

They are often unrea­

sonable.
This case does not involve an entry to search for a
suspect who may or may not be there.

It does not involve a

delayed arrest for a crime committed long ago.

The officers

had seen Santana in the doorway with their own ©yes and they
knew she had committed a crime there moments before and
probably was still committing a crime.
QUESTIONt

How far away were they when they learned

of the sale to McCafferty?

How far ©way were they from

Santana's house?
MR. EASTERBROOKi

About a block and a half, Your

Honors and they returned that block arid a half in a very brief
time.
This immediate arrest not only put a half to an on­
going crime, but it preserved the evidence of that crime and
the crime that had just been committed in the sale to
McCaffertyt it prevented any possibility of flight, it pro­
duced maximum surprise, and by that token, maximum safety to
the officers, because if the officers had been compelled to
desist and effect a house arrest, their personal safety could
have been in some danger if they later attempted to make the
arrest once Respondents knew they were there and attempting
to arrest them.
In many ways this case is similar to Sure v. United

21
States., which we discussed in our reply brief*

Officers had

possessed probable cause to believe that Sure was committing
the crime of distributing distilled spirits and that he had
some such spirits in his car.

They followed Sure’s car to his

home and arrested him in his garage.
upheld that arrest.

The Court unanimously

It observed that the passage of the car

into the garage did not destroy the officers' right to follow
and to arrest Mr. Sure, and so it is hare.
Respondent’s passage into her vestibule did not des»
troy the officers* right to arrest her for an ongoing crime.
QUESTIONs
going crime theory.

Mr, Sasterbrook, may I ask about the on»
You told me a little earlier that the

reason they had probable cause to believe she was then commit­
ting a crime was that you assume that one who sells soma
heroin retains soma in supply.

Do yon also assume that the

retained heroin is on the person of the defendant, or merely
on the premises?
MR. EASTEFJBROOK:

We assume only that it is on the

premises, Your Honor, and as I indicated in response to a
question by the Chief Justice, it would be permissible to
arrest that person,

ht that point if a search of the premises

were necessary to discover the heroin, it would be appropriate
to obtain a warrant to make the search of the premises for the
heroin 0
QUESTIONS

It would not only foe appropriate but

22
necessary.
MR. E&STBRBROOK:

Necessary, yes.

We do not argue

that you can search the premises if the heroin is not on the
person who is arrested.
QUESTIONS

I think you said before or indicated that

the limit of the officers9 conduct once they got in the house
was Ca) to search the persons of those arrested, and (b), to
seise any contraband in plain view, and the third alternative
would be to take them in custody and preserve the status quo
while awaiting another officer who would' go to secure a war­
rant?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

Yes, Your Honor.

The search would

go no further than the permissible scope of the search under
Chanel v. California, which included the person of the person
arrested and the area within his reach at the time of arrest.
We do not believe, however, that the right to make
the arrest of Santana depended necessarily on the fact that
she was commiting the crime of possession of heroin with in­
tent to distribute.

We submit that it is reasonable' for

officers to enter the house within a few hours after a crime,
here the crime of the sale to Me Cafferfy, whether or not this
justification is called fresh pursuit, it is based on an entirely
practical understanding that the first few hours after a crime
are critical, both to capture the suspect and to recover theevidence.

It is a justification based on exigencies that

23
pertain to many cases»

The decisions of the courts below by

requiring officers to delay and invest one or more hours in
obtaining a warrant would disable them from acting during tills
most critical time immediately after a crime had been committed.
Once those first few hours have passed the need for haste is
diminishedf but at least during the first few hours it is
reasonable for officers to act promptly to make the arrest.
The District Court disagreed with this argument be­
cause, it said, the police could not fee sure that respondents
would flee, could not be sure that respondents would destroy
evidence, and so on.

The problem with this approach, as I

indicated earlier to you, Mr. Justice Stevens, is that there
are many possible outcomes during the first few hours after a
crime.

They are in reality no more than predictions cf proba­

bilistic events.

oh, no, there is

no
QUESTION:

What do you mean, "Oh, no"?

MR. EASTERBROOKs
QUESTION;

We are not arguing that she knew.

Oh.

MR. EASTERBROOKs

We are arguing that the prompt

25
arrest prevented her from learning.
QUESTIONS

Yes, but if aha did not know, how could

she fee about to destroy valuable —
ME. EASTERBROOX!

We are not arguing, Your Honor,

that she was about to destroy these ~
QUESTION %

Well, I thought you said that was the

whole basis of going in?
MR. SASTERBROOK%

Our argument is that officers might

reasonably believe that some suspects will destroy evidence.
We are not. arguing that this was necessarily such a suspect.
QUESTIONs

Well, once they began walking up her

driveway when she was standing in the door, what would be her
probable reaction, since you are dealing in probabilities?
MR. EASTERBRGQKs

Her probable reaction, we think, is

to attempt to destroy the evidence that she has and to attempt
to flee if they were required to desist after they were walking
up her driveway.

But again, as we have argued, it is simply a

question of probability and we think it was reasonable for the
officers, in consideration of these probabilities, to continue
on to make the arrest.

Our argument rests on probabilities

and it rests on an analysis of reasonableness that pertains to
many cases other than this one.,
If there are no questions, I will reserve the re­
mainder of" say time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS H. EISMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MS. EISMAN.
Court?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas© the

The issue before the Court today is in reality whether

200 years after the Declaration of Independence Americans can
be secure in the knowledge that the police may not broach the
sanctity of their homes, seise them or their loved ones, carry
them away without a judicial finding of probable cause for
their arrest, excepting the argument that in certain cases,
exigent .circumstances would require an arrest without a warrant.
QUESTION :

What do you suggest as a hypothesis for

the probabilities when the officers approached the door and she
was standing in the open doorway, as it turns out with heroin
either in her hands or on her person, with her own knowledge?
The record shows that she had just engaged in a sale of narcotics.
MR. EISMAN:
District Court, why

Well, what the record shows in the
the District Court, I believe, held this

way, was that the police set in motion the fact of the dis­
covery of the arrest by their own action in immediately going
to the house and taking the option of immediately rushing up
in plain clothes with guns drawn, rushing the house, when
the Court felt below that it would have been just as easy and
more constitutionally proper for them to have gone immediately
to the place where, in Philadelphia, where the jutices of the
peace sit on a 24-hour basis, which was only a half an hour

27
away, gotten a warrant and returned, and not rushed the house
with guns drawn, children sitting on the steps- in plain
clothes, in this fashion»

So I think the argument that once the

police ran up to the house with their guns drawn, that the
Defendant would have known that they were coming to arrest him
would have destroyed evidence begs the issue that the District
Court found■Was■that thty should not have acted in that

~'f&ssfeipn.
They said that thev had the time, there ware no exi­
gent circumstances absent vha . the police themselves created
here in this case.-

The exige it circumstances as pointed out

by tli® Government in this cas

z

are all circumstances Which were

created by the Government's action and; could have been negated
by merely getting a warrant and returning to the house and
making the arrest»
QUESTION s

Suppose the lady had been on the front

porch and had not identified the police as policemen as they
approached, perhaps assuming that they were magazine salesmen
or what-not»

Could they have lawfully arrested her then and

there?
MR. ElSHAN%
QUESTION%

think —

Given the knowledge that they had about

the prior transaction a few minutes before?
M3U EISMkNs

I think if ahe were out in the street

©r if it was an open porch not connected inside the clothes of

28
the house, as we might say, it might — the case might fall
into the area of the Watson decision.

But in this case the

record clearly shows that she was inside the doorway, and as a
matter of face, one of the police officers testified, even in
the vestibule, and X think one of the reasons this case is
here today is to decide the issue different from Watson, not a
person out in a public place but whether a person inside the
home has the security that we sufonit the Fourth Amendment gives
additional rise to the security of the home.
In. this case there was absolutely, according to the
findings of the District Court, no exigent circumstances.

There

was no information whatsoever that the Defendant was armed or
dangerous.

There was no degree of time necessary to get a

warrant, as in the Miller case another circuit case where they
knew it only took fifteen minutes to cut heroin and it would
have taken them. 45 minutes to get the warrant.
Here the District Court found that on the facts of
this case, they had ample time to get a warrant.

Thirdly,

there was no information that the Defendant was in any way
aware that the police was on her trail.
Finally, there is no evidence whatsoever in the
record as it stood when the police rushed the house that there
would foa an effort to dispose of the money, which is 'the only
real evidence that the police were talking about in this case,
that they were going in to - seise.

29

The Court below asked the specific question, on page
37 of the record, now, at the minute you left, what was your
purpose of going to the house, what did you intend to do?
"Answer:

I immediately intended to recover the

marked money that was used in the transaction and arrest the
defendant Dominga Santana»"
Nothing in the record in this case that they had
reason to believe that there were additional narcotics present
in the house or that this Defendant in fact possessed them»
As a matter of fact, the record in this case, interestingly
reveals no direct information that it was this Defendant who
made the sale.
The evidence presented in this case was that, the
police officer saw MeCafferfy go into the house with
Alejandro and come out of the house shortly after.

The police

had never seen Mrs. Santana at all that day and when asked
about the transaction, the only thing that McCafferty said
was Mom has the money, not that Mom sold the dope, but that
Mom had the money.
QUESTION:

Well, how could Mom get the money if she

did not sell the dope?
MR. EXSMMh

Well, she was seen going into tha house

with the co-defendant, Mr, Alejandro, and coming out a short
time after, and 1 think .it would be just as logical to assume
that the dope could have h©en sold by Alejandro and somehow

30
she saw the proceeds eventually go to Mrs, Santana, was told
that the money would eventually go to her.

But in this record

and I am not arguing with the finding of the District Court on
probable cause here, what I -am saying is the record here is
even a little unclear as to what knowledge the police had when
they charged, the house with their guns drawn in plain clothes,
with children sitting on the step£, saying,

"Police,"

Here, in addition to the issues raised by the
Government on their appeal there was another issue that I do
not think the court really thought it necessary to get to, but
that was that the circumstances of this arrest, the failure to
say we are here to arrest you, ami merely running up with gun©
drawn into somebody * s home, without stating the purpose for
that entry, was in fact improper also.
The sanctity of a. person's home is not only I be­
lieve guaranteed by the Constitution, but it's a tradition
that goes back ■ hundreds of years in England and our AngloSaxon heritage,
It is a problem not only that existed at the time of
our Revolution and according to many writers was one of the
fundamental reasons why in 1776 there was a Declaration of
Independence- but in fact, exists today outside of our country
in England.

The history of the Fourth Amendment which I don't

intend to dwell on at any great length -QUESTIO!?:

What do you think the common law rule was

about making an arrest in a. home without a warrant if there was
probable cause?
MS, EISMANs

In England there was no requirement for

a warrant to make an arrest, and *•: submit that is the reason
why our Constitution was written, and our Fourth Amendment was
written to the Constitution, was to distinguish between what
was going on in England and the Colonies in those days and what
was hoped for to be different in this country, because in
England today, according to at lea.;t the press in London, there
is before the House of Parliament a bill that gives the
Internal, or Inland Revenue Service, as it is called in
England, the right to go into somebody's home and search for
any papers necessary to prove tax evasion and take away any­
thing necessary and break the —
QUESTION:
MR, EISMAM:

Without a warrant.
General warrants — with a warrant but

not no warrant specifying to any general specific areas.
QUESTION:

Does the warrant have to be supported by

probable cause?
MR. ElSMAN:

No, it is a warrant that is obtained from

a justice of the peace which according to the reports I have
read has absolutely no knowledge of what the Inland Revenue
Service might be interested in.
But the point I am making, this is a general warrant,
type of warrant that was used in England and the Colonies before

32

the Declaration of Independence which led to the eventual find­
ing that a Fourth Amendment to the Constitution was necessary.
If the Fourth Amendment does not protect us from in­
trusions into our home and protect us from the police determina­
tion as to whether or not they are going to arrest us by putting
between the police and the citizen a judicial, disinterested
determination, then. what: does the Fourth Amendment stand for?
It has to stand for the fact that in America, citizens before
they can fee .taken out of their house, whether it be day or
night — and I do not think, although it is a little more
horrendous to be dragged from your home without a' warrant at
night than it is to be dragged from your home or have your- sons
or daughters dragged from your home in the daytime without a.
warrant — at least if we know that before the police came to
our house, absent exigent circumstance, that a judge had found
probable cause, then I believe we would be finding what our
forefathers in the Bill of Rights wanted for our country, that
it -be different from the systems in other countries and that we
woul-1 have the protections of a judicial determination of
probable cause.
In this case, there was absolutely no exigant circum­
stances found by the trial court, and no reason to go into the
home and drag out Mrs, Santana in the fashion it was done.
This was & row house with people sitting, children
sitting on the step, and the facts are that plainclofcb.es-

33
policemen1

jumped out of the van, ran up with guns drawn, right

into the house and grabbed the Defendant»

It is a frightening

aspect or specter to think of, even though when we consider
that the crime involved is a crime that we consider serious»
QUESTIONS
MR. EISMAN:

Frightening to Mrs» Santana, do you mean?
Frightening that it might happen to one

of us, that the police may come to our house, run up with guns
drawn in plain clothes, run through the doorway where we're
standing in our. vestibule and grab us.

It is frightening to

\

think' that not only does, can this happen to someone as alleged
like Mom Santana, but it could happen to anyone where the police
are the ones making the determination,
QUESTIONS

Well, given exigent circumstances there is

no doubt it can happen and properly happen,
MR. EISMANs

Well, I concur that where the person is

armed and dangerous, where

If evidence that the person

can destroy the evidence or might destroy the evidence or might
flee, that that is a coiranonsense, logical exception to the
warrant requirement.

But here in this case, and 2 believe in

the reason why this case is before this Court today is the
determination of absence of those exigent circumstances.
Do we as American.citizens have the protection of a
judicial determination before we are seised?

Normally before

this time, most of the cases requiring warrants were just for
the seizure of property, and I am the first to admit that

34
property rights are extremely important in our society.

But

rights to physical arrest, 1 believe, are a little more import™
ant and the seizure of our person goes even deeper than the
seizure of our property and people should at least have the
same rights to protection of a judicial determination before
the seizure of their person that they have in the seizure of
their property.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Eisan.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Easterbrook?
ORAL ARGUMENT OP FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER ~ REBUTTAL
MR, EASTERBROOK;

Counsel for respondent has indi­

cated that a problem in this case is the failure of the officers
to announce that they were officers and state their purpose
and to demand, entry.

Now, I will deal with that just quite

briefly.
It is not clear that the Constitution requires any
announcement.
rectly.

Kerr v. California presented that question di­

Four Justices believed that it did, four Justices

believed that it did not, and Justice Harlan expressed no view
on that question.
Assuming the Constitution requires soma sort of announcement, the pertinent analogue would be 18 U.S.C. 3109,
which requires an announcement prior to the breaking of the

35
door of the house.

Our reply brief devotes substantial space

to this question and we have argued that walking in through an
open door in the view of someone who knows that the officers
are coming is not such a breaking that an announcement is re­
quired by section 3109, and, in addition, there was no chance
here that any of the harms that that rule was intended to pre­
vent could come about,
The rule was designed to prevent the exertion of
force by officers, the breaking of doors when that kind of
breaking could be avoided by consent.

It was also designed to

avoid unnecessary opportunities for violence.

The householder

in England had a right to. protect himself against those who
would break down his door and enter, and the rule of announce­
ment by letting him know that the police were coming would
prevent that sort of violence.

But this case doesn't present

either of those two rationales and we submit should not be
covered by them.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is23 o'clock p.m., the above-entitled
case was submitted.]
