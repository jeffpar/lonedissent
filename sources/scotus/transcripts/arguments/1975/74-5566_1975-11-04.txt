MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

N G S
We will hear arguments

first this morning in 74-5566, Barrett against the United
States.
Mr. Schaffer, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. SCHAFFER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHAFFER:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

My name is Thomas A. Schaffer.

I'm from

Cincinnati, Ohio, and I'm the attorney for petitioner, Mr.
Pearl Barrett in this action.
Th© question that is presented before the Court
this morning is a simple on© and a single one, and it involves
whether or not title 18 of th© United States Code, section
922(h) applies to the petitioner, Mr. Barrett, who purchased
a firearm in a purely intrastate transaction and was not
himself personally involved in any manner with the interstate
transportation of that weapon.
The facts are basically undisputed, and they are
as follows:
On. April 1, 1972, Mr. Barrett purchased a Smith and
Wesson .38 caliber pistol from one Larry D. Bates, the owner
and operator of the Western Auto Store in Bonneville,
Kentucky.

Petitioner later that day was stopped for a traffic

offense in Owsley County, Kentucky, the surrounding county.

The police at the time they apprehended Mr. Barrett searched
his vehicle and discovered the weapon lying on the floor on the
passenger side.
Sometime prior to this occurrence Mr. Barrett had
been convicted of the crime cf .housebreaking in. the Common­
wealth of Kentucky, so he was a convicted felon, as described
by section 922(h), and as that section prohibits, ha was
allegedly forbidden to possess that weapon, being under the
disability of a prior felony.

He was subsequently charged

under section 922(h) and he was convicted — pardon me.

He

was tried in fcha United State3 District Court for the Eastern
District of Kentucky at Jackson, was convicted on Hay 24, 1973.
He then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Circuit sitting in Cincinnati, Ohio, and that court
affirmed the conviction on October 13, 1974.
The Government, at page 27 of their brief, in
referring to the differences between the statute that we have
here today, 922(h),

Part Title IV of the Gun Control Act of

I960, and Title VII which was passed subsequent to Title IV
state in their brief that "there is no reason to believe that
Congress intended to produce this topsy-turvy result when it
enacted these related provisions as different titles of the
same Act."
Petitioner contends today that indeed Congress did
intend to produce different results with Title IV and Titi® VII.

5
Title IV# or section 922(h), that section with which we are
concerned today, covers in part the receiving of any firearm
which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign
commerce, while Titia VII, which was passed subsequent to
Title IV, states that it is prohibited to receive, possess,
or transport in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm.
We would ask the Court to note the difference in
position of the word "firearm" in those phrases.

We feel that

this is an important distinction between the Acts, and as we
go further into the argument and bring out the legislative
history, I would hope that the Court would recognise that
Congress in placing that word behind the modifying words is
the difference in the statutes, and it is this difference that
we feel controls the question that is before the Court this
morning.
QUESTION;

Would you say that Congress has no power

to forbid the possession of a firearm shipped at any time in
the past in those terms in interstate commarce, the prohibition
being limited to certain categories, including convicted felons?
HR. SCHAFFER;

No, sir, that i3 not our contention

at all.
QUESTION:

You say that Congress could do it, but

they didn’t do it here.
MR. SCHAFFER:
saying

Yes, sir, that's exactly what we are

6
QUESTION*

You concede that Congress could make it

a» offense to buy a pistol that had been in th® State of
Kentucky for 10 years, that 10 years previously it had been
shipped in interstate commerce?
MR, SCHAFFER:

Your Honor, that is not part of iay

argument, but I contend that that is most likely what title VII
of the Gun Control Act has done.
QUESTION:

You don’t think there is any problem as

to Congress’ authority to do something like I described?
MR. SCHAFFER :

I would say that Congress has

certain limitations as case history has developed, tout in this
Instance, if a gun can be determined to have affected commerce,
as the cases have cited, or the cases have reported in
title VII situations, I feel the Congress does have that power.
But we don’t, have that question here and we are not raising
a question as to the. power of Congress to govern such activity.
I'Ja are merely stating that in this Act or this statute under
which petitioner has been charged, the Government, through
Congress, did not prohibit intrastate sales of interstate sales.

It merely spoke

And we feel that because we have a

purely intrastate transaction, that Congress did not intend
that to be covered under title IV.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Schaffer, is Mr.

Barrett still ~~ is he incarcerated still?
MR. SCHAFFER:

No, sir, he is not.

Us is out on

parol©
QUESTION s

Has he ever been incarcerated on this

charge?
MR. SCHAFFER:

Yes, sir, he spent, to the best of

my knowledge, approximately a year and 8 months in the
Federal penitentiary in Texarkana.
QUESTION;

But his sentence-, technically has not been

served yet.
MR. SCHAFFER;

No, sir, the full extent of his

sentence has not been served, feliat's correct.
QUESTION;

Going to the language, you have said that

Congress has the power to prohibit a felon from possessing or
receiving a firearm that has at any time in. the past bean
shipped in interstate commerce.

You conceded the power to do

that.
MR. SCHAFFERs
QUESTION;

You say this statuta doesn't do it.

MR, SCHAFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I do.

Yes, sir, that is our contention.

What words would you think would have to

be in that last paragraph of section (h) "to .receive any
firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported
in interstate or foreign commerce.'’

Would the words "which

has aver before," would that do it?
MR. SCHAFFER:
bit more clear.

I would think that would raak© it a.

But I feel the Congress has adequately

8
covered the {situation with title VII when it placed the word
"firearm" after the modifying words of "receiving, possessing
or transporting in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm."
I feel that that phraseology does cover any firearm which at
any time in the past has been transported in.interstate
commerce, and 1 feel that Congress must have determined there
was a deficiency in title XV, otherwise they would not have
passed title VII.

The Government would have us believe that

there would be a redundancy in the statutes, but I don't feel
that's the case.

I feel that Congress recognised that, there

was a loophole in title IV and sometime?, after the passage of
title IV they passed title VII to amend that loophole.
As a matter of fact, Senator Long who was one of the
sponsors of titia VIX proposed an amendment on the floor trying
to close the problem that they had had with title IV, and it
was his contention that he wanted to tie up title IV in such a
way that no felon at any time might possess a weapon.

In

response to a question from Senator Dodge from the floor, that
question beings

"Senator Long, is this amendment a substitute

for title IV," Senator Long answered,

indeed it was not a

substituta for title IV, rather it was an addition thereto.
It appears to me that the existing legia.lati.on, was
obviously not strong enough at that time, otherwise Senator Long
would not have proposed this amendment to cover any felon
possessing any weapon.

There must have bean something that

9
Congress saw, and indeed we contend that there is something,
a loophole here.

But there must have been something that

Congress saw that would have encouraged them to pass title VII
to cover up the problems that they had been having with title IV,
Indeed, in House report 1577, on section 922(h)
prior to its passage, the House report stated that the
principal purpose of title IV,

the Gun Control Act, was

'■to strengthen Federal controls over interstate and foreign
commerce in firearms."
How, the history of that bill provided that what the
Government was attempting to establish was a more effective
licensing system with respect to these people who deal in
firearms.

The Act was intended to limit lawful transactions

to those between Federal licensees, those people whom the
Government had given permission to sell firearms, or, and this
is a quote from the Congressional Record, at page 14773, "The
Act", that is, section 922, “would limit those lawful transactions
to those between Federal licensees or to those persons who
reside in the same State."
Sc here it is from the people who were passing the
bill, words from their own mouth saying, "We are not attempting
to legislate intrastate sales between people who live in the
same State.

Rather we are trying to establish Government

regulation over the firearms dealers, those persons to whom we
will grant licenses.M

10
Title XV was passed as a responsive measure to the
national concern over the sal© and the transportation of
firearms across state lines.

The people of this country had

spoken to Congress, had told them of the need to curtail this
activity where one person could live in the State of Michigan,
go into the State of Ohio, purchase a weapon, and then go back
into the State of Michigan.

The purpose for this is obviously

because the State of Michigan is going to have tougher gun
laws tiian the State of Ohio.

It's easier for a person to go

from one State which has tough laws into another State.
In addition, Congress was attempting to cut off the
mail order supply of guns, which I am sure the Court is aware
has become a very grievous problem.

But again we are talking

with, dealing in guns and persons buying guns out of State.
Gun trafficking is what section 922 attempted to curtail,
not gun possession.
House bill 17735, or section 922(h) as we have here,
was passed and was put into effect by Congress to eliminate
this interstate or across State line trafficking in guns.
It appears to me that the key in tills situation where we
don't have an interstate transaction,also quoted from House
Report 1577, at page 4415, the Congressman stated that so long
as the last step in ttib transaction is intrastate, the shipment
would not — 1 repeat, would not —~ be prohibited by Federal
law.

We feel this is the cruse of the case before the Court

12.
this morning»

Congress did not intend,, the House of Represents**

Lives did not intend, that section 922(h) would cover intra­
state sales.

Indeed, the Senate concurred in that.

Senator

Tydings,who was one of the major sponsors of Ids.® bill, felt
that the people who were to be affected by 922(h) were, and X
quote, "juveniles, felons, and fugitives who today can with
total anonymity and impunity obtain guns by mail or fcv crossing
over State lines into neighboring States which have lax or no
gun laws at all, purchase a weapon and than return to their
own State."
Hare we are talking about what X have been speaking o
really what the House was concerned with, that is the felon
who may cross the Stato line, purchase a weapon and return to
his own State.

That’s a differant situation than what is

before th© Court this morning.

Any over-the-counter sal®, according to Senator
Tydings, was to be prohibited except, as Senator Tydings said,
in the buyer’s home State.

It's important, I feel, to define

the word "buyer” and what Senator Tydings had in mind,

h

reading of the legislative history does not indicata that there
is any restriction or qualification as to definition of buyer.
Now, in other parts of the Act they hav® defined the
terms, they have spoken of felons and fugitives and juveniles»
But as to the word "buyer" there has boon no distinctions!
qualification as used in this meaning.

So vm contend that if Senator ladings felt that a
citizen could buy a gun in his home State? qualify under the
definition of buyer? that citizen roust also have included those
persons under disability, that being felons, fugitives, and
juveniles.
QUESTION;

If the colloquy among Senators or

Representatives explaining or undertaking to explain a bill
is in conflict with the pit in language of the statute, which, is
to prevail?
MR. SCHASTER;

Your Honor, it has ^5©©n my experience

that if there is confusion, then we should look behind the
plain meanings of the word and into the legislative history.
QUESTION:

I will try my question again.

If the

language of the statute is plain and clear and unambiguous but
some Senators and Congressman expressed a different vie»: of
what they thought it mean, which then controls, the language
or the views of two or three Senators?
MR,, SCHAFFER:
question.

Excuse roe for mi. sunder standing your

I would agree with you, then, that the plain Meaning

of the statute would
QUESTION;

control.
Then this statute says "to receive any

firearm which has bean shipped in interstat© commerce."

Now,

this was shipped at scans time in interstate commerce and you
have indicated, at least tentatively, I thought, that if the
statute had inserted the word "which has ever before been

■

shipped, *’ or “which was 'previously shipped/' then you wouldn’t
be here.

That’s what I thought you had conceded.
MR. SCHAFFER;

Yes, sir.

I

did agree with you that

had those words been placed in the statute, it would have made
it more clear to me, anyway.
QUESTION 3

More clear.

MR. SCHAFFER:

More clear.

And I cannot take it

upon myself to say that that would be entirely determinative
as to the meaning of the. statute, but for myself,having been
involved in 'the case for over 2 years now, I would have to
say that that would make it more clear to me.
QUESTION:
tfoe

What do you think the word "receive“ in

statute means ?
MR. SCHAFFER:

I believe that !,roceiv®" indicates

receiving in an interstate commerce transaction.
QUESTION:

It is a broader term than "buy*1 isn’t it?

I mean, I receive something from you if you hand it to me.
MR. SCHAFFER:

Yes, sir, that’s true.

I think what

Congress was attempting to do was to regulate those persons
who will order a substantial amount of guns from a mail order
house, say, in New York, sell in Ohio.
Now, indeed, they are buying the guns, but they are
also receiving the guns in a shipment so that they may sell them
themselves in their hom® State.

And as I see it, that's gun

trafficking, and that's what I believe the Act was intended to

prohibit: or at least regulate to a certain extent*
QUESTION*

Why cou.ldrs51 Congress .be as much concerned

with these local purchases as it is with mail order purchases?
MR. SCHAFFERs

1 believe that Congress is concerned

with the local purchases, and X feel that Congress once they
passed title XV realised that they war© not effectively
prohibiting or controlling local purchases, so they then
passed title VII which does control local purchases.
I would agree with /our Honor that Congress should
and has stepped into the area of purely intrastate, sales,
but it is our contention they did not do so in this Act, and
I feel, that the legislative history, the words of the Senators
and the Congressman, as to why they were passing this bill
indicates that it was their purpose to control the trafficking
first and sometime subsequent to controlling the trafficking,
they then sought to control the possessions of intrastate
sales or* possessions that occurred fro.; intrastate sales.
QUESTION*

hasn't the ultimate objective of

Congress to keep firearms out cl the hand© of individuals,
just & given person who fell within this statute, that is,
had a prior criminal conviction? or other categories?
ME.. SCHAFFER.’,

Yes, sir.

purpose was to do exactly that.

X believe that -the ultimate

My reading of the history of

922 indicates, or Title IV in its entirety, indicates that
even though that was the ultimate purpose, that was not the

15
spoken purpose of this Act»

Time after time the Senators and

the Congressmen spoke in concerning this Act with gun
trafficking.

Sad I don't feel that intrastate sales fits

within the definition of gun trafficking.

I think this is the

problem that occurred# er.d again I would state this is what
they realised after they passed the Act. that even though
their ultimata purpose was to keep guns out of the hands of
felons# fugitives or juveniles# they had not accomplished, that
with Title

IV# and I would simply state that had they don© so

or had they fait that they had done so# there would have been
no reason to pass Titia VII.

And ©van though I would

personally agree with everything that they did in Title VII
and what the ultimate consideration was in Title IV» I
respectfully contend that they did not accomplish what they
intended to do with Title IV and they found soon after that
they had to add to Title IV and control purely possessory
crimes within Stata borders.
QUESTION;

Do you have in mind the case of United

States v. Sullivan involving misbranded drugs?
MR. SCHAFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir# I do.

Justice Black# writing that opinion.- said

it really didn’t make any difference that these drugs had
corae to rest in the State and had been on the shelf for 6 months
before.

Dees that have some implication in this case?
MR. SCHAFFER:

Sir# I think it's distinguishable in

16
that the identity of the drugs is what Congress was intending
to protect in the Sullivan case and with the legislation passed
to cover misbranding of drugs.
In a Sullivan set of facts we have a package of
drugs which passes across State lines and is labeled Brand X,
if you will.

If, then, a pharmacist were to take that package

and label it Brand Y, the consumer is purchasing something
which he has been misinformed on.
I would agree that Congress certainly has the power
to protect the consumer at that point.

But I also feel that

in a gun situation we don't have quite that same set of facts.
Thor® is no misinformation.

When a person buys a gun, the

act of buying the gun itself, although he may end up shooting
himself with it, is not personally harmful to him.
what he is purchasing when he buys it.

He knows

The Government doss

not have to protect his intelligence or his awareness at that
point.
With misbranding of drugs they do.

They have taken

it. upon themselves to protect the ultimate consumer for
misinformation.

And I don't feel that’s what vm have in our

ea so.
QUESTION*

My question that what seemed to b® your

argument that the interstate’s relationship was too tenuous
here..
MR. SCHAFFERS

No, sir, that's not specifically what

17
lay argument is.

1' first thought that that might be what J.

would attack, but looking into the history of the law, that’s
not the intention that we hav© this morning.

X don't, feel

that what the Government has don® is in and of itself a
tenuous or an arbitrary decision to regulate the sale of guns.
I just feel that the statute under which Hr. Barrett was
charged is not exactly what Congress intended to do.
not worded specifically enough.

It’s

It does not cover the

transaction that's involved todayi
I would say that were I to argue against Title

¥11,

I might take that position that you have just indicated, that
the interstate commerce nexus is too tenuous.

But that*s not

my point here this morning, and 1 don’t really feel that —
quite honestly, I feel that Title VII is worded in such a way,
and according to the case law I feel that it would withstand
prosecutior.al attack, and I’m not here to do that.

I'm not

here to attack the commerce clause's extension into the
interstate sale of guns.

Bo I feel that even though Sullivan talks about that,
I -would agree with what was said in .Sullivan, but I would
distinguish it in that wa are talking about a different type
of product which is being shipped interstate, we are talking
about a different reason for regulation by the Federal
Government.
There have been, as I am sure the Court is aware, a

16
a number of canes which have cone from the circuits regarding
the interpretation of Title IV and I‘vs cited these in my brief,
I’ve cited there appears to be a sp3.it as to what the circuits
feel and there has not bean up until this point a great deal
of law from the Supreme Court because the cases have not come
before it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schaffer, if your client had wanted

to avoid violating this statute &s the Government construes it,
what steps, could he have taken to advise himself as to whether
or not the gun he sought to purchase was prohibited?
MR. SCHAFFER;

I believe that if we accept the

Government’s position, the only thing that Mr. Barrett could
have done would have been ;o buy a gun purchased in the State
of Kentucky.
QUESTION;

But how could, he know?

H© would have to

buy a gun manufactured in Kentucky.
MI;. SCHAFFER;

Yfc-s, -air. If we accept the Governis
meat's position, 2 feel • list/it* only thing he could have done
tc protect himself.

.Ano, the question you raise is a good one,

how would a purchaser know where a gun is manufactured., and is
that raising too much of a burden on a citizen to ask not onlymay I purchase the gun, but from where did it come.

I don't

feel that —■
QUESTION;

Suppose the gun were stamped "Colt

Manufacturing Company, New Haven, Connecticut"

19
MR. SCHAFFER:

I would say that, if we were to accept

the Government*3 position., then, person purchasing the weapon
would be on notice that he is committing, or violating a Federal
law.
QUESTION:

Because it had been manufactured in

Connecticut.
MR. SCHAFFER?

Yas, sir.

I think that under those

circumstances, again if we accept the Government's position,
that is in essence the crime or the act which is being
prohibited by this statute as they see it.
QUESTION:

Does this record show whether he filled

out a Form 4473 when h© purchased it?
MR. SCHAFFER:

Sir, the record indicates that the

seller of the gun never presented that form tc him.

He never

had the form in front of him, he never made any statement as
to whether he was a convicted felon.

However, ha did state

on cross-examination had he been asked that, had he been asked
if he were a convicted felon, he would have answered yes.

But

he was never given the opportunity.
QUESTION:

He buys it at a Western Auto store and

he received no form.
MR. SCHAFFER:

Yes, sir.

that he knew the seller of the gun.

I think what happened was
It was his hometown and

he had known the person for some time.

And I believe that

what happened was he went in and he placed half of the money

down for the gun, picked up -the gun, and said, "I'll foe back
on Monday ho pay you the rest of the money."
Now, T. thin]?, what the seller might haw-® been thinking,
although itss not indicated in the record, it might have
occurred to him over the weekend that he failed to give him the
form, that when he returned on Monday he might have asked him
at that time to fill it out.

But w® don't have any problem

Ivere as we have in some of the cases from the circuit where
ha made a false statement.
QUESTION:

What was his explanation for having a

loaded gun in the automobile so soon after purchase?
MR. SCHAFFER:

He didn’t say.

I did not represent

him at the trial court, and he didn't say.

I might say, though,

that the cases that I've handled from the State of Kentucky
people have come out and sard on the stand that everyone owns
a gun in Kmvtueky, something like that.
This Court has spoken, as I am sure the bench is
aware, in the case of United States v. Bass, the opinion
written by Mr. Justice Marshall, that is, to the best of my
knowledge, the only case law that has come down.

And I will

admit that that was in the form of dicta, it was not the
holding of the case.

That case concerned, as I am sure the

bench is aware, with Title VII, it was concerned with section
1202, and in that opinion Mr. Justice Marshall stated that he
felt that section 1202,or Title VII, was significantly broader

in reach than Title XV, and he felt, that by reading section 1202
in such a way as to give it a broader interpretation, he felt,
that that preserved the significant difference between the
receipt offenses of Title XV and Title VII, and that's precisely
what we contend today, that there is a difference between the
receipt offenses.

One concerns intrastate receipt, that is

’ll tie VII, whereas Title IV concerns itself only with interstate
receipt.
Mr. Justice Blackman in the case of Huddleston v.
United States, which is cited by respondent, stated that he
felt that from the outsat it was apparent to him, anyway, that
the focus of the Federal lav;, that being section 922, was the
federally licensed firearms dealer, the trafficker, the a••-slier.
That is the person, those are the people, to whom section 922
was to apply.
Mr. Justice Blackmon went on to say that fee felt the
inf iiit of the Act was to force the dealers in certain circumstans
not to sell, to prohibit them from selling to certain individuals
So again the focus is here on the dealer and not the buyer.
That1s section 922.
Petitioner were he charged under Title VII, I contend
this quite strongly, would not have the argument that we have
made today.

I feel that Title. VII does cover intrastate sales.

Title IV, as I hope wo have pointed out to the Court this
morning, Title IV was enacted to control the business of selling

22
guns.

Title IV went into great detail about licensing

provisions, regulations as to licensees or sellers of guns.
They went into strict rules as to whoa the licensee might sell
these guns.

It dealt specifically with interstate transactions,

It talked about mail order guns, it talked about going across
a State line to purchase a weapon.
QUESTION;

Which section of 922 are you talking

about now?
MR. SCHAFFER:

I believe 922(a), although — I

believe that's the section, your Honor.
with dealers.

That concerns itself

And the section subsequent to (a), I believe

(b), (c), and (d) deal specifically with regulations on the
licensed seller.
Petitioner would contend this morning there was
indeed a loophole in Titla IV that, although Congress intended
ultimately to control intrastate transactions, it did not do
so with Titio IV.

And we would point out that had there not

been a loophole, there would not have been a reason for Title
VII, which was passed some time after Title IV.
We contend that, the petitioner's conviction should
be reversed on this basis.

He purchased the gun in his horne

State of Kentucky, purchased it in his hometown.
leave the State of Kentucky.
Kentucky with that weapon.

He did not

He was caught within the State of
And other than the fact that the

gun itself was manufactured outside of the State of Kentucky,

there is no other connection with interstate commerce.
Thank you very much for your attention this morning.

Mr. Reich.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. REICH ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR, REICH:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The sole question before this Court this morning

concerns the scope of section 922(h) of the Gun Control Act,
Section 922(h) is set out at page 11a of our appendix.

It

provides in pertinent part that it shall be unlawful for any
person —* and then there are four categories.

The first

category is "who is under indictment for, or who has bean
convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment
for a term exceeding one year,"

that latter category of

person whom I shall refer to as a convicted felon;
"who is a fugitive from justice;
"who is an unlawful user of or addicted to marihuana
or any depressant or stimulant drug...or narcotic drug;

QUESTION:

He obviously, then, hadn.41 read the Bass

opinion, had h@?
MR.REICH:

The Bans opinion, we would contend, Mr.

Justice Stewart, did not authoritatively construe Title IV,
which was to become section 922(h) as being limited to direct
interstate receipts.

And if you enable me. to get to the Bass

opinion in just one moment, I would like to state that had the
Government intended tc limit the scope of section 922(h) to
direct interstate receipts, as petitioner urges, it presumably
in the Gun Control Act would have used language to that effect,
such as section 922(j) which you will find on page 12a of our
appendix which states that "It shall be unlawful...to receive.,
any stolen firearm.„.which is moving as, which is a part of,
or which constitutes, interstate...commerce,” or section 922(k)
which is also on page 12a of cur appendix which states that
"It shall be unlaw...to receive, in ...commerce, any firearm
which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number
removed."
I think it's very indicative that Congress, rather
than employ these standard phrases, "which is a. part of or "which

corstitutes"or

!Vhich is moving as/' or a firearm in commerce?

chose instead to provide 'that it shall' be unlawful for any
convicted felon or other category of potentially irresponsible
person to receive a firearm which has been shipped or transported
in interstate commerce.

The structure of the Gun Control Act

confirms our reading of the plain language,,

The Gun Control

Act is a comprehensive scheme whose provisions reveal a common
design to keep firearms from coming into a State and falling
into the hands of convicted felons or other categories of
potentially irresponsible persons.
Now, to this and, licensees,all interstate shipments
of firearms must be channeled through licensees.

Once a

firearm has reached a State, come into a State, the licensee
is prohibited in an intrastate transaction from selling or
otherwise transferring a firearm to a convicted felon or an
indictee, a fugitive, or any other category of potentially
Irresponsible person.

That's in an intrastate transaction.

Also in an intrastate transaction a purchaser must
atfcsst truthfully that he is not a convicted felon and that
he is not also an indictee, a fugitive, or other category of
potentially irresponsible person.
QUESTION5

Now, section 922
My question was, was he guilty of any

QUESTION:
crime in doing that?
MS. REICH:

He was not guilty of knowingly selling

a firearm to a convicted felon as 922(d) provides, because ha
did not follow the required procedure and have the purchaser
fill out a Treasury Form 4477.

So he is perhaps guilty, in

fact he is guilty of violating the Treasury regulations requir­
ing a dealer to have a purchaser fill out this form so that
the dealer can know whether •—
QUESTION s

What has been done to him?

HR. REICH:
was he prosecuted.

He was warned,

fie was not indicted, nor

He was warned that if this happened again,

however, he would be.
But the dealer also in an inferastat® transaction,
according to the Gun Control Act, has to keep careful records
of all the people to whom he sells.
QUESTION:

My point is you point all these things you

do and you are not enforcing them.
MR. REICH:

What good is that?

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, as far as I

am aware, all -chose provisions are being enforced.
New, the one instance in this case where the dealer
had violated

the regulation in terms of not finding out

specifically whether this man was a convicted felon in that
intrastate transaction —
QUESTION:

A mar- comas in and says,

"I’ve got

half the price of a gun, you give me the gun and I will gc out
and get the other half and bring it back in to you Monday,'"
that's all right.
MR. REICH;

I would say that it's not all right.

Were 2 the Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of this case, I
think there would be a possibility of an indictment of this
dealer.

Unfortunately, in terms of proaecutory discretion,

the Assistant U.S. Attorney or the U.S. Attorney did not
follow through on that, but did give the dealer a warning.
QUESTION;

Is it a criminal offense to violate the

Treasury regulation?
MR. REICH;

I simply am not aware or not sure of that,

sir, Mr. Justice Relinquish.
QUESTION:

What would he have been prosecuted for

if it’s not a criminal offense to violate the Treasury
regulation?
?4R. REICH;

If it is not a criminal offense to

violate this Treasury regulation, he would not have been
prosecuted.

I air; as sural ng from Mr. Justice Marshall's question

for the sake of the question that it would be a criminal
offense.
QUESTION;

What difference does that make?

We are

29

talking about the felon anyway, aren*t we?
MR. REICH:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

My point is

that all of these provisions, including a provision that
requires that a purchaser attest truthfully, certify truthfully
in an intrastate transaction that he is not a convicted felon,
all of them have the common purpose of keeping firearms out of
the hands of the convicted felon, even in an intrastat®
transaction.

And it is the Government's submission that

section 922(h), our reading of section 922(h) makes that an
integral part of this comprehensive schema because it deters
directly that which the rest of those provisions I indicated
seel? to deter indirectly.
Now, petitioner’s construction of section 922(h) would
create a major gap in this comprehensive regulatory scheme
because it would enable a convicted felon to receive a firearm
as in the instant case through tine inadvertence or negligence
on the part of the dealer who simply neglected to find out
whether ha was a convicted felon, or to the simple expedient
of getting a friend or a relative ox* somebody else to get it
for him.
QUESTION:
neglect?

What

in the record says this is

There is nothing in the record as to why he did it.

Am 1 right?
MR. REICH:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the dealer

was questioned on tha stand.

He indicated that he had known

30

the buyer, petitioner, for 5 years, had absolutely no idea that
h© was a convicted felon, and because it was Saturday night,
he was going to have petitioner come back and fill out the
forms Monday morning, he just simply didn't feel that it was
important.

He thought it was a mere formality because he had

known the guy.
But this is an example of how through this kind of
carelessness the entire comprehensive regulatory scheme of the
Gun Control Act can be undermined.
QUESTION:

If he had filled it out, we. wouldn't have

this case, would we?
MR. RFICH:

If he had filled it out and if the

dealer had looked at it, we would not. have this case, that's
absolutely correct.
QUESTION;

Both of them, then, violated the Act by

selling it notwithstanding the disclosure of the conviction.
MR. REICH;

That's conceivable, Mr. Justice.

What is also possible, in fact, even more conceivable,
is that a convicted felon or a fugitive or a narcotics addict
who wants to obtain a firearm but who wants to avoid all these
prophylactic rules need only under petitioner's construction
gat his friend or relative or somebody on fcha street to go in
and get it. for him.
Now, it seems to us very unlikely that Congress in
enacting the Cun Control Act with all these measures designed

to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons, even
within an intrastate transaction, would have created such a
major gap in the scheme.
QUESTION:
MR. REICH:
QUESTION?

Mr. Reich.
Mr. Justice Blackmun.
Let me suggest this to you;

Suppose he

went in to see his old friend the dealer and said, 151 want a
particular model," but the dealer didn't have it.
"Order it for me."

He said,

Sc he ordered it from South Carolina.

Then

would he be subject to prosecution clearly?
MR. REICH:

Under section 922(g), which I believe is

set out at page 10a of our appendix, under 922(g) a convicted
felon or other category of potentially irresponsible person
is barred from shipping or transporting a gun in interstate
commerce.

How, read in conjunction with section 2(b) of title.

18, which makes one. punishable as a principal, if he causes
an act to bo committed, section 922(g) would indeed bar a
convicted felon or other category of potentially irresponsible
person from ordering or soliciting a gun across a State line.
QUESTION:

What I am trying to bring out is the fact

that just the accident of having the gun on Idle shelf or not
having it on the shelf on your opposition’s theory, it would
make a difference as to whether he is prosecuted — capable of
prosecution or not.
MR. REICH;

Absolutely right, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

32
The prosecution,, if the gun happened to foe on the shelf, in
fact in the instant case, the firearm just happened to be the
last one in the dealer's stock.

If it happens to foe on the

shelf, under petitioner's construction, there is no violation
of the Act.

If the dealer has to order it for him, under

922(g), as I already indicated, there is indeed a violation
of the Act.

And it’s improbable that Congress intended that

an offense under the Gun Control Act would turn upon the
vagaries of a dealer’s inventory in. such a way.
QUESTION:

Well, if it had that in mind, the statute

might well have been written with an insert "known to him to
have been shipped in interstate cQxamerce," or "knowingly
receiving."
MR. REICH:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
The scienter factor %/as left out of the

statute, was it not?
MR. REICH:

The scienter is left out of the statute,

922(h) it’s left out of.

Scienter enters into one or two

other provisions where convicted felons or other individuals
are prohibited., for .instance, from knowingly receiving a
stolen, firearm.

But you are correct that scienter does not

enter into section 922(h) at all.
puts
QUESTION: It / the burden on the purchaser to,
if he wants to be careful, I suppose, on your theory of the
case, to inquire whether it was manufactured

in Kentucky or

33
elsewhere.
ME. REICH:

That3s correct.

Section 322(h) puts

the burden directly on the convicted felon, puts him on notice,
that if he receives a firearm that has been shipped or
transported in interstate commerce, he is liable.
QUESTION:

It would mean that to take Justice

Brennan's illustration a while ago, if a man in Hartford bought
a Colt pistol manufactured at New Haven, Connecticut, he would
not be violating the statute.
MR. REICH:

Is that it?

He could be fairly well sure that he

would not foe violating the statute.

However, there is always

the possibility that although manufactured in Connecticut, the
firearm had traveled outside th© Statu at some point in its
history.
QUESTION:

What if it moved on an interstate ttrain

from Hartford to Now Haven?
Ml. REICH:

I don't believe that that would violate

the statute, because the plain words of the statute indicate
only that it's illegal to receive a firearm which has bean
shipped or transported in interstate commerce, and presumably
that means .across a State boundary.

1 think it would make the

Act somewhat unworkable to extend interstate commerce to mean
any order©® of interstate commerce.
What about on page 13a, Mr. Reich,, of your brief
where, you set out 18 U.S.C. appendix .1201, which 1 believe is

34
the introductory section of Title VII which Congress passed
later.
MR. REICH:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
And there you have a kind of finding that

you have in many recent Acts of Congress, chat Congress finds
and declares that the receipt, possession, et cetera, is a
burden on commerce.

In other words, a finding for the

purposes of that legislation in its entirety that these
particular Intrastate, acts do burden interstate commerce.
And then you have section 1202 which does clearly
regardless of immediate shipment in interstate commerce make
it unlawful for a felon to purchase a gun.
Then you go back to the Act this man was prosecuted
under and there isn’t any sort of generalised finding, such
as there was in 1201, that Congress uses when it wants to
embrace a lot of intrastate transactions.
MR. REICH:

Well, Mr. Justice Rahnquist, there was

a finding ir the Senate report, in fact at the baginning of
the Senate report there was a saries of findings, that did not
make their way into tho final draft, for reasons I don't quit©
understand.

Often findings in final reports of the Senate

or Congress simply don’t find their way into final drafts.
But that Senate finding is, I think, quit© indicative.

QUESTION 2

Is that entitled to the same degree of

35
weight as if it had made its way, as you put it, into the
legislation?
MR. REICH:

No, but it is indicative, I think, of

Congressional intent as to whether Congress —
QUESTION:
MR. REICH:
QUESTION:

Not if it wasn*t enacted, is it?
As a matter of legislative history —
Just the opposite.

It's indicative of

what Congress did not intend to do if they had it before them
and did not enact it.
MR. REICHs

Well, that may be,

As a matter of

legislative history, however, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think it
might be indicative that tins Senate did find and declara that
the ease with which any person can acquire firearms, including
criminals, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, is a significant
factor in the prevalence of lawlessness.
My point with Mr. Justice Rehnquist was not that there
was a specific finding that Congress intended to encompass
intrastate transactions, perhaps because Congress felt that it
v?as very clear from the structure of the Act, and as this
Court held in Huddleston, many provisions of the Act already
pertain to intrastats transactions.

The finding to which I

was referring is merely a general bread finding that Congress
was concerned with keeping firearms out of the hands of
convicted felons and not limiting itself only to interstate
transactions.

other gap.

But 1 understood you to say there was some

Would you rair:d clarifying that or repeat it?
MR. REICH:

Yes.

The gap to which X referred was

the ease with which a convicted felon or any other category
could simply receive a gun through either the inadvertence of
a dealer or by the simple expedient of getting a third party,
a friend or relative, to get it for him.
Now, Mr. Justice Powell -QUESTION:

Is that unique to 922, or would that not

42
also apply under Title VII„
MR,, REICH %

Under 1202(a)

for categories that are

not included in'!thin 922, v?h©re. there is not an overlap between
those two provisions, all those individuals, according to the
construction that a plurality of this Court gave to section
1202(a) in Bass, there would be no gap because they would be
prohibited from receiving a firearm which has been shipped or
transported.
QUESTION?
MR. REICHs

Or possessing.
Or possessing, that5® right.

But as to fugitives or indictees or addicts, or
©van as to ammunition, I think an important area where the
statutes did not overlap has to do with ammunition.

Ammunition

is covered in Titi® IV which became the Gun Control Act, 922(h),
but is not included within 1202(a).

So therefore even under

petitioner's construction, any adjudicated — narcotics addict
or fugitive or indictee can with impunity get somebody to get
a gun for him, get ammunition for him, even a convicted felon
can with impunity can get someone to get ammunition for him.
We think Congress simply did not intend to create
this gap, especially when it used such plain language.
J, might also say that whatever Congress intended
in 1930 with regard to that language, given the structure

of

the Gun Control Act in 1968, given all the prophylactic measures
which I have mentioned that are geared toward keeping firearms

43

cue of the hand» of convicted felons or other categories of
potentially irresponsible persons, and also given that Congress
must have been aware in * 68 of its authority under the
Commerce Clause to enact legislation that govern intrastate
transactions, it is not at all unlikely that Congress used
this language and gav© it its common sense meaning, that is,
that it covers the receipt of any firearm which has been
shipped or transported in interstat© commarce.
On© more thing.

Petitioner's construction of 922(h)

would also relegate section 922(h) to mere redundancy with
that provision I mentioned before, section 922(g), which already
prohibits the convicted felon or other category of potentially
irresponsible person from shipping, transporting, or causing
to be shipped or transported in an interstate transaction a
firearm.

So that under petitioner's construction, 922(h) would

have an independent force and effect only in those very
unique circumstances where the interstate shipment has not been
solicited in any way by the convicted felon.
QUESTION?

I'm reading what I think is 922(g) on

page XOa and 11a of the appendix to your brief, to the Govern"
ment's brief, and it just says

to assign section 922 (h) such an, absurdly insignificant rcle
