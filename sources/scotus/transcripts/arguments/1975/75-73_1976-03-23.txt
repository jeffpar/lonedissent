PROCEEDING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll hear arguments next

in 75-73, Bellotti, the Attorney General of Massachusetts,,
against Baird? and 75-109;, Hunerwadel against Baird,,
Mr» Rosenfeld, you may proceed whenever you’re ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF 3. STEPHEN ROSENFELD, ESC . f
ON BEHALF OF BELLOTTI, ET AL0
MR. ROSENFELDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This is an appeal from the order of a 'three-judge
court in the District of Massachusetts.
The majority of that court enjoined the defendants
from enforcing Mass. General Laws, Chapter 112, Section 12P
and related sections.
The majority also declared that Section 12P was
unconstitutional on its face.
This statute was originally enacted on August 2nd,
1974,, and it provides that before an unmarried minor

in

this case a child under’ eighteen —• may obtain an abortion.
The physician involved must, obtain both her consent and the
consent of her parents.
Importantly, if either parent refuses, a Stc.te court
judge is explicitly authorized by the statute to give his
consent for good cause shown.
The action was brought by -the plaintiffs on October

4
30th, 1974, the day before Section 12P was to go into effect,
and the principal plaintiffs were Gerald Zupnick, a physician
performing abortions; and two pregnant minors who were
seeking abortions with the knowledge of -their parente»
A single judge entered a temporary order restraining
the enforcement of 12P, convened a three-judge court., and
subsequently granted intervention to parents of unmarried minor
daughters in Massachusetts; and those interveners are represented
today by Mr» Brian Riley, whose argument will follow7 mine»
The three-judge court, after four days of hearing,
issued its opinion on April 28th, 1975»

And the majority

found tee section unconstitutional, on its face, because it
invaded fundamental privacy interests of minors»
The court acknowledged that all the experts, both
the plaintiffs' experts and the defendants' experte, believed
that parental involvement was very important and. helpful to
the child at this crucial time»
The court, however, construed the statute on its own,
and found that in its view tee statute created parental rights
teat were independent of the interest of the child»

Therefore,

asserted tee court, the parents would be authorized under the
statute to refuse consent in order to punish the child or for
other misguided reasons»
QUESTIONs

Did the -three-judge district court have

the benefit of any State court construction in reaching that

5
interpretation of the statuta?
MRo RQSENFELD;

No, it did not, Your Honor, because

the statute in fact had never been allowed to go into effect
and no case had therefore come up to the State courts
QUESTION;

Did the three-judge court give any

conside rati, on, or was it asked to give any consideration to
abstaining in order to permit the Massachusetts courts to
interpret the meaning of the statute?
MRo RQSENFELD;

It was asked to abstain, Your Honor,

and it decided that such abstention was unnecessary, without
giving reasons therefor»
It would be our view that, quite apart from
abstention, the existence of

the judicial review provision

provides the opportunity for a narrowing construction in the
State court, and therefore justifies a finding that at least
on its face the statute is not invalid, because of this
opportunity for a narrowing construction»
QUESTION; Well, then, you say, in effect, that even
'though the three-judge court had not abstained, the

it was

obligated to construe the State statute more narrowly than it
did?
MR» RQSENFELD;

I’m suggesting that there were

alternatives. Your Honor? it could have abstained, but even if
it decided this was the kind of case that it should decide on
the merits, since the only attack was a facial attack, the

6
existence of a good cause provision for the State court to
grant consent was sufficient basis for finding that, at least
on its face, the statute was valid because a State court
utilising common-law principles well established in Massachu­
setts might narrow the statute to come within constitutional
limitso
QUESTION'S

So you say the three-judge district court,

should have left the statute standing and in particular cases
perhaps there might have been an unconstitutional application,
but it would be sufficient for that evil for the day, so to
speak?
MR. ROSENPELDs

That's right, Your Honor.

On this very point, the district court found that
the provision in 'the statute for consent to the abortion by a
State court judge would not protect the child's privacy
interest because, again in the district court's view, it was
part of a s tatute enacted for the benefit of parents and not for
children.
QUESTIONS

Could the parents of a twelve or 13-year-

old girl compel the child to have an abortion?

Under the

Mass achusetfcs statute„
MR. ROSENPELDs

I would say, Your Honor, that that

would be — that would certainly be consent and that,
therefore, the abortdon —
QUESTION s

Well, doesn’t the statute contemplate

7
that the child is first seeking the procedure, -»
MR. ROSENFELD:
QUESTION;

Yes, that’s right.

— and the parents are second.

Now, suppose a situation where the child takes no
position at all, perhaps is not capable of making any} may the
parents go to the doctor, and the child has nothing to say
about it?
MR. ROSENFELD;

Not on the face of the statute,

Your Honor, because on — the statute requires that the
physician obtain the consent of both the minor and her parents.
So it contemplates that, at least in the first instant;©, the
judgment of the child will be taken into account.
But, in addition, the judgment of the parents will
also be given the opportunity to participate in the decision
for the minor's abortion.
QUESTION;

In what other areas under Massachusetts

law is the consent, the affirmative consent of a minor
required to be given?
MR. ROSENFELD:

Your Honor, there are a number of

provisions ~~ in fact they are set out in our dissent to the
district court’s opinion, in a footnote.

They deal it areas of

adoption and various kinds of licenses, the consent of a —
the consent of parents is required.
Specifically, Your Honor, as an example, no child —
in the adoption of a minor child, the consent of both that

e
minor child and the natural parents is required before the
adoption can be. approved by a State court 0
The final point I wanted to make about the district
court's opinion is that the district court found that parental
consent was unnecessary? because* in the Court's own words, a
substantial number of minor females on their own were capable
of informed consent about whether or not to have an abortion.
Today* in our argument, the State will focus briefly
on three issuese
First, the rights and interests of parents end child
under the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 12P;
Second, the State's interest in enacting 12E? and
Finally, the important role that the statute; gives to
the State court to authorize the consent or to authori se an
abortion for good cause shown, where individual circumstances
so suggest.
The State's view of the daughter's rights and the
parents’ interest are decidedly differant from either the
plaintiffs or the interveners or the district court.
With regard to parente, contrary to the district
court and to interveners, the State does not believe that this
statute or any other source in lav;- gives parents the right to
refuse consent for reasons other than -the child's well-being»
We do believe that parents have an interest, the
interest in assessing what will best serve the child's needs.

t

9
The parents’ interest, we believe,, is a derivative one, and
is entirely a function of their greater relative capacity for
j udgment 0
Thus,, we believe it was wrong for the district court
to separate out and exalt what it labeled as parental rights„
With regard to minors, we believe that minors have a
constitutionally protected interest in privacy, and it
includes the abortion decision»
However, in legislation affecting minors, the State
may take account of differences in capacity between minors
and adults, and enact broader legislation for minors»
In other words, it is the State’s position that
adults and children both have rights of privacy protected by
the Constitution? but 'the State may pursue different find
important interests when legislating specifically for minors»
Turning to the interests; of the State which, justify
the requirement of parental consent, they are as follows s
First, the statute seeks to support the rol€: of the
family in a situation where the need for family and family
support is plainly called into play»

It assumes not that

parents will be punitive, but that they will be supportive and
assist»
QUESTIONs

That goes to the fact even if the; girl

is living away from home, on the other side of town, and hasn’t
seen her parents for the last three years?

10

MR. ROSEMFELD:
QUESTION;

You want to preserve 'that?

MR» ROSENFELD:
Honor, becaus©

Your Honor, in Massachusetts —

No, this statute will not, Your

because of th© provision for consent by a

State court for good cause shown, we believe that the common
law principle of the freedom or emancipation of the minor
would be affected»
QUESTION:

Nell, I’m only talking about this»

Your

idea is you want to keep th© family together®
MR® ROSENFELD:

Where it is together —

QUESTION: Well, this applies to all, whether they’re
together or not®
MR. ROSENFELD:

It applies, iii the first instance, to

all. Your Honor»
QUESTION s

That5 a right.

MR» ROSENFELD:

¥@s, that's right»

W© believe; that nothing in th© record establishes
the contrary proposition, to the fact that parents will be
supportive where -the family unit exists®
The second
QUESTION:

But the plaintiff in this case was
a

alleged to be residing with her parents, though,
MR» ROSENFELDs

That's quite right, Your Honor? she

was residing with her parents»
The second State interest is its health and welfare

11
interest* in insuring participation in decisions about a minor0s
abortion by those who know best from medical and emotional
history,

It's an effort to guarantee 'that this history will

be brought to bear on the abortion decision.
Some parents may object* not to the abortior; itself
but to the conditions under which it is performed.
For example, taking from the record, there may b©
instances, indeed are instances, where abortions are performed
on minors with little or no counseling? or where that
counseling goes on, it goes on in groups, with no opportunity
for individual understanding of the plight of the particular
minor.
Often it may happen, and doss happen, that physicians
will perform abortions with no prior knowledge of the child
aad possibly an inadequate knowledge of her prior medical or
emotional history, QUESTION;

Well, at page A~2 3 of tiie Jurisdictional

Statement, the dissenting opinion in the footnote, the
doctor*s response was that usually it’s the first time he's
met the person when he walked into the room to perform, as he
said, I guess it was an average of half a dozen or more
abortions at ona session.
MR. ROSENFELD:
QUESTION^

Usually —

Now, is there some -- with a minor, is

there some consultation by some other counseling person that

12
precedes that?
MR. ROSENFELD:

Your Honor, in all cases there is a

— as the record shows, an hour of prior conversation with
adults and minors mixed together in ~~
QUESTION:

But not with the — not 'with the

physician.
MR. ROSENFELD:

Not with th® physician.

Although

the record suggests that on occasion the physician may
participate to some degree, but the usual situation is. that the
physician sees the child for -the first time when she comes in
to actually have the surgery done.
QUESTION: Well, one way for 'the State

to attack

that problem would be to require that a physician consult
with the patent, is it not?
Rather than to go about the way thay3 ve done it.
MR. ROSENFELD:

That is one method, Your Honor,

assuming that the patient would be in the position to be able
to appreciate and make a judgment with regard to the abortion
decision.
And, as we say, this interest is one of a number
of interests that we think that — that the State is pursuing
in enacting Section 12P.
We believe that the parents might fairly condition
an abortion on having that abortion done not under the circum­
stances that I’ve just, described, but under the circumstances

13
that exist, and are available in the City of Boston? for example,
at the Beth Israel Hospital, as is also reflected in the record.
We believe that the health and welfare interest

of

■fche State here goes beyond its support of the family unit.
This interest I am now speaking of is usually characterized as
parens patriae,

It’s the State's own independent concern

for protecting the minor„
Now, the State recognizes that neither this concern
nor its concern for family would justify am outright
prohibition of abortion, as was the case with the Texas
\

statute in Roe v9 Wade,
QUESTIONS

Such a —

Am I correct in understanding this case,

for your Massachusetts statute, is different from the Missouri
one, and that it requires the consent of both parents — not
just one,
MR, ROSENFELD;

It does. Your Honor, that is a

difference,
QUESTION;

So that here, then- one parent has

absoluto veto power?
MR, RQSENFELD; Well, we disagree that the veto
power is absolute, but bote parents do have the power over
the consent —QUESTION;

Even though they were separated?

MR, RQSENFELD;

No, Your Honor,

If they were —* if

they were separated but not. divorced, the statute is unclear

as to what the situation would be in that instance # but the
statute makes plain that, where required,- or in appropriate
circumstances^ one guardian# if you will, will do*
And again w@ underscore the importance of the State
court good”*cause provision# to deal with the individual
circumstances# such as you have suggested»

We feel that in

this area, individual circumstances are the norm and r.ot the
exception# and -that a statute must, take account, of that —•
any statute must take account of that by giving some
flexibility and an opportunity for construction consistent
with the Constitution# the State's interest and the interest
of the child®
QUESTION:

Mr, Rosenfeld, —

QUESTION:

Let me see if I have -this straight®

You say if parents are separated# that the consent of only one
is necessary?
MR® ROSENFELD;

I'm saying that on its face the

consent of both would be necessary, because you've used the
word "separated" rather than "divorced"»

But that if the —

I believe that if the separation were# if you will# a divorce
in fact# this certainly would fea

I believe it would be

sufficient# given the statute for the consent of on© parent
to suffice? and the provision for State court involvement is
there on the face of Section 12P®
QUESTION:

I thought the phrasing was s,if the parent

15
virere deceased or has deserted his or her family, that then
only the consent of one would be sufficient”„
MRQ ROSENFELD;
QUESTION;

That's right, yes.

But if they are merely separated, it

doesn't seem to me to tie into your statute very —
MR. ROSENFELD;

Well, it certainly fit, the

word 15deserted”, on its face.

And I'm not suggesting that

tiie statute as written would guarantee that the consent of only
one parent would suffice in that instance.
I believe, Your Honor, that the Legislature, in
enacting any statute, can only deal specifically with so
many situations, and the responsibility beyond -that is to
provide a process whereby additional individual circumstances
can be dealt with to avoid the rigidity and overbreadth that
would otherwise be the case.
It's important, in our view, to note, Your Honor,
that this is the only statute of all the parental consent
provisions dealt with by lower courts that provides explicitly
for the involvement of the State court, and provides that the
State court, quit® apart from what the parents have done,
may provide consent.
And I want to turn now, Your Honor, to that
judicial review provision.

We believe that in the end the

State recognizes that there has to be a process to focus
directly on the child's interest and privacy.

And by giving

16
the State court a role, the Stats believes that Section 12P
provides the kind of flexibility and satisfies this need to
take account of individual circuraetances »
There are specifically two common-law principles
that the State court is likely to use in applying 12P*s goodcause standard»
First is the mature minor rule*

It's a well-

established common law rule in Massachusetts that when the
minor shows the capacity for informed judgment, the rationale
for parental consent ceases, and the court should authorise an
abortion»

It*s important to point out that with this common

lav; rule. Your Honor, this is not a conclusive or irre butable
presumption that the statuta sets up, it's a rebu table presump­
tion, and the process is provided whereby that presumption can
be rebutted»
The second common-law principle is the court's
•<

independent responsibility to act in the child's best interest»
Even if the mature minor rule does not apply, the common law
compels in Massachusetts 'that the consent be given if the
court, making its own independent, assessment, finds that
abortion would be in the child's best interest»
We believe, in light of these principles, that there
is good reason to believe that the statute will be applied
faithful to -the Constitution»
The State submits that it should be given the

17
opportunity to exercise its. police power within these selfimposed limitse

That these

QUESTIONs

Mro Rosenfeld, does the statute tall us

anything about idle procedure to be followed at such a hearing?
For example, are the parents of the mother entitled to notice
and to participate?
MRo ROSEN FELD s
to those itemso

The statute does not speak specifically

It does suggest that no guardian ad litem

need be appointed —
QUESTIONS

For the mothere

MRo ROSENFELDs

— for the pregnant minor to have

the process that the statute provides»
QUESTIONS

Wellf would you construe the statuta as

permitting the pregnant minor to go before the court without
giving notice to her parents., and thereby —
MRo ROSENFELDs

Yes, wo wouldf Your Honor? and we

speak to this in our brief specifically,,

We believe that since

the statute says that common-law rights are preserved, and
since the common law provides 'this opportunity for the minor
child in consent situations, that the minor could attempt to
go into court? and it would be up to the court, as part of its
good-cause decision, to decide whether or not ‘the parents need
be consulted in the first instance»
And of course there is also provision for anonymity
in the State courts

18
QUESTIONs

But. you’re than suggesting that that

decision can be made with,out the benefit of the family history
which you suggested was the reason for the parental censent»
MR» ROSENFELDs

Well* only* Your Honor* only if a

Stats court judge* familiar with these kinds of cases* were to
exercise his judgment in that regard»

And I don’t believe

that any general rule* any inflexible rule can be stated that
that

would dictate an outcome in one direction or the other®
What I do believe is 'that the difficulty of these

questions does not compel a conclusion that the State has no
role in the area of protecting minors and protecting the
minor’s best interest»

And we believe that’s what the State

has dons in this statute»
QUESTION % But it is the view of the Stata* if I
understand you

correctly* then* that -the interests of the

pregnant minor's parents is insufficient to entitle them to
notice in a hearing of this kind?
MR» RQSENFELDs

No

excuse ma* Your Honor® What

suggested is that if a child went into State court saying
that in this instance the individual circumstances were such
that it would be damaging to notify the parents * because-of
some individual circumstance* the State court would have to
decide* first* the threshold question»

It would have to

decide* before deciding whether or not to consent 'to the
abortion* would have to decide whether or not the parents

should be notified, and whether or not the hearing should b®
held.
We believe that the statute must say, suggest that
in most instances the parents should b© notified.
that is the policy of the statute.

Indeed,

I'm saying there may b©

that rare occasion where it would be — the State court judge
might decide it is unnecessary or in fact harmful to inform
the parents? and in that case, the State court might proceed
to the next question.

That is, whether or not to grant its

consent to the child's abortion.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rosenfeld, how does this statute

change the common law of Massachusetts, if at all?
MR. ROSENFELD:

Well, Your Honor, this statute,

we believe, codifies the common law.

We believe, for example,

that the two parent requirement is one. of long existence in
Massachusetts.

We believe it is a codification —

QUESTION;

In other words, your answer is that it

doesn't change the common law?
MR. ROSENFELD:
point, Your Honor,

It doesn't.

But I have an additional

of course it provides for a fine, a

criminal fine, and there was no provision for a fine at common
law.

It does not provide for any jail sentence, I might add.
One additional point, if I may. Your Honor:

There

was a statuta passed in the last six months which deals with
consent, and it’s raised in the plaintiffs' submission to the

20

Court
QUESTION?

Which does change the common law —

MRa ROSENFELDs
QUESTION;

That does change the common law.

— as to other surgical procedures for

a minor*
MR. ROSENFELDs

It does*. Your Honor.

I frankly --

I think the record is inadequate to deal with -that statute
here, and I think 'the statute that has been passed is an
ambiguous one, and I believe that this Court should deal with
the constitutionality of one statute at a time.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Mr. Riley.

OHM. ARGUMENT OF BRIAN A. RILEY, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF HUNERWADEL, ETC.
MR. RILEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court

At tne outset we wish to make it clear that this is
not an abortion case in our mind, but, rather, deals with the
issues of medical treatment of minors and informed consent.
The fundamental issue raised by 'diis appeal is
whether parents would be given the opportunity to exercise
their right sad duty, to guide and protect their children in
me di c al d® ci s ions.
This includes abortions as well as all other medical
decisions.
The Interveners submit 'that Roe vs. Wade and Doe vs.

21

Bo1ton lend no support to the plaintiffs5 contentions»
Wade and Bolton involved an adult woman’s right to effectuate
a reasoned and informed decision to terminate a pregnancy0
These cases concerned adult women, who have always bei;n
considered capable of giving a valid and informed consent to
medical treatment.
In the present case* however, w© are concerned with
minors.

Minors have always been deemed incapable, as a class,

of giving an informed consent to medical treatment.
Th© Court in Bolton held that an abortion is merely
a medical procedure and should not be differentiated from
other medical procedures.

The same is true of minors who seek

medical treatment. They should not be treated differently than
minors who sea's other forms of medical treatment.
The lower court acknowledged this fact when it held
that Dr. Eupnick could not legally perform abortions on minors
that were incapable of giving an informed consent.
The lower court found, however, that it was —
that it’s significant that there were a certain number of
minors who were capable of in fact giving an informed consent.
The court, nevertheless, found that in determining
whether a particular minor is or is not capable of giving an
informed consent, that there would be factual questions to
weigh in each case.
The essence of this appeal is*

Who should weigh these

22
factual questions?

Who should determine whether a particular

girl is capable of giving an informed consent?
assist her in this decision-making process?
doctor? Should it be her parents?

Who should

Should it be the

Or should it be a judge of

•the Superior Court?
The Interveners submit that 'the parents, at least in
'the first instance, should aid her in this decision»

This is

in accord with a long line of decisions which hold that the
care, custody and nurture of children reside first in parents
and in no one else.
The Interveners submit that parents,at least in this
first instance, should be given the opportunity to gui.de their
children in this decision.

This is not only their right, but

it is also their duty and obligation to do so.
All of the experts in this case agree that an
unplanned pregnancy for a minor girl is accompanied by a great
period of stress.

These girls are typically scared, frightened,

they’re desperate children.
Ona expert described these girls as upset, withdrawn,
non-communicative, and anxious.
Expert testimony reveals that such an adolescent is
often compelled to seek an immediate solution to the problem.
They want instant, relief.
It is crucial at this point that this decision to
abort be the product of an informed and reasoned consent, and

23
not merely a desire for instant relief for the crisis she faces
at the momento
The minor girl is entitled to and must obtai.n proper
guidance in assessing the risks, the complications, and the
alternatives to 'the abortion procedure*
This guidance is generally supplied to

her in

discussing the alternative procedures®
It’s important that the girl resolve in her mind that
whatever choice she makes, it is the product of reflection and
not a reaction to the crisis that sh© is in*
All of the experts agree that parental support and
guidance is extremely necessary to help the child through this
difficult period in her life»
It is submitted that the great majority of parente
will provide their children with the proper guidance and
support teat they are entitled to*
Parents are the ones who are most interested in
assuring teat their daughter receives proper medical care and
guidance.

Parents ar© best suited to aid her in choosing a

doctor and a medical facility which offers the quality of
interest and sensitivity that

can deal with this delicate

problem for tee child.
Finally, parental concern and involvement will
insure that there is proper follow-up medical car© for the
child if it is necessary, whether it be medical or psychiatric#

24
or both®
Although the great majority of parents would act in
the best interest of the minor children, the Interveners
acknowledge that some may not®

The question, then, is who

should fill this void?
Should it be the doctor, or should it be the State?
The Interveners submit that it should be a judge
of the Superior Court rather than a doctor®
Judges have always been resorted to when a conflict
develops over whether a parent is acting in the bast interest
of their child’s health and well-being®

Judges have always

been resorted to to determine whether or not a particular
child is in need of a particular medical procedure®

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY LUCAS f ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LUCAS:

Mr. Chief Justicee may it please the

Court s
The three-judge court below and many other courts
facing these issues across the United States have viewed these
issues in a fundamentally different way from that suggested
by the Commonwealth and by the Interveners.
It has generally been presumed that statutes of
these kind mean what they say? namely,, that in the first
instance one or both parents have a right to veto the
exercise of access to abortion on behalf of a minor, regardless
of the healtli condition or the circumstances of the minor.
The statutes on their face and as they’re written
expressly place a medical decision in the unfettered discretion
of two persons other than the patient and persons other than
the physician.
There’s not even an express exception in this statute
to protect the life of the young woman or to protect the health
of the young woman.

There’s not even any mention of her health,

solely that of the power of the parents to veto and consent.
And indeed there is no exception made in the statute in the
case of rape or statutory rape.

And nowhere is there any

mention of the possibility of the physician's judgment in an
exceptional case, allowing an abortion —

28

QUESTION?

Wellr isn't for good cause shown an

exception, Mr* Lucas?
MR. LUCASs
QUESTIONS

Excuse me, Your Honor?
I say you’ve spoken of unfettered control,

isn’t til® Massachusetts 53for good cause shown" provision an
exception?
MRo LUCAS?

That is one3, potenti.al exception, but it

is totally undefined, and there are an infinite number of
circumstances in which there could be good cause according to
the patient, but not according to the Superior Court.»
The problem with the good-cause clause is that it,
in effect, sets up an obstacle course which is designed to
defeat the exercise of a constitutional right by a minore
There is no other statute in the Commonwealth which requires a
person to go to court to be able to exercise a fundamental
right.
It's our position that the good-cause clause is even
worse than the multiple-physician-consultation requirement in
Doe v. Bolton.

It's even worse than the requirement of a

hospital committee in Doa v, Eo.lton»

At least those requirements

had physicians reviewing the matter? here you have parents
and you have the Superior Court judge without any provision
whatsoever, for example, for an expedited hearing.

There’s

no provision for the patient having access ‘bo legal counsel

MR. LUCASs

I would presume that there would be expedited
QUESTION: Well, in most States a temporary restraining
order can be obtained without notice to anyone, by walking in
and finding the judge and presenting the matter to him.

Is

that not so?
MR. LUCAS?

That’s true.

I can’t imagine a judge

granting an ex parte temporary restraining order without
notice to the parents here.
And it has been our position consistently, that

32
requiring the patient to even notify the parents could be
seriously disruptive of the patient's life and disruptive of
the family c to tie extent that a notification requirement would
be something we'd be opposed to„
And* in particular* the abstention cases in this
Court have tended to indicate that, there should be some
reasonable basis to believe that a State court construction
would avoid the constitutional questions„
QUESTIONS

And —

Suppose a 12-year-old or a 13-year-old

girl had inherited a very substantial amount of money, real

Laying aside for the moment that no person in his right mind
would accept a transfer or pay anything for it* from a 12-year™

There's certainly no emergency in the property area either*
and that was testimony in the record here that delay could
cause the possibility of the mi no is seeking out illegal nonmedical abortions; and that would be one of the main problems.
And the delay here could taka the minor over into the second
trimester of pregnancy* where the procedure would be more
complicated —
QUESTION;

Well* the assumption in each case is

that there would be an undue delay.

But you haven’t — at

of these questions.
MR. LUCAS;

Even if they did* though* even if we

assumed that the State courts could reach the issue within one
week or two* there’d be some medical cases where that would be
or

hazardous.

And* on top of that* the State court has no guide­

lines whatsoever* on which to know what factors to look into.
That's our chief problem with it* is that the Roe vc Wade

QUESTION:

But equity judges have managed to get

along pretty well for a couple of hundred years on general
equity principles , have they not?
MR» LUCASs

That's true.

But in this particular

case f there is no guidance whatsoever for what factor.? they
should take into account»
That is ‘the principal problem with the good cause»
QUESTIONs

Well, couldn't the Supreme judi.cial

court of Massachusetts at least heive gone part way towards
curing that if it. had had a chance?
MR»LUCASs

It could have gone some of the distance,

yes, it could have — there are so many different types of
problems that could come up, though, there -- it seems; to me
that —
QUESTIONs

Well, but, it seems to me that the more

different the problems and the more diverse the problems are,
the more you make out. a classical case where the district
court should have abstained»

Here the constitutional question

of the necessity of the parents' consent is one that is
reserved in Roe, and the district court had an opportunity
with this consent provision to say. Let the State court put it
in a different posture and come back and tell — then we'll
decide the constitutional question»
It seems to me hard to justify their failure to
abstain»
MR» LUCASs

Y@s

Well, we would disagree; with that

35
strongly? because the State court would have to litigate -the burden would b® put on the courts to take into account all
the different ages? all the different health condi tior.is ? the
rap® situation? the incest situation? the different reasons
the parents night have for withholding consents it would impose
a tremendous burden on the State courts? if not on the federal
courts? when people would go in in 1983 actions„
QUESTIONS Well? presumably the Massachusetts
Legislature was willing to have that burden placed on the State
courts when it enacted the statute„
MRo LUCAS:
presumably

Presumably they were? yes0

But?

certainly there's no indication of what the

legislative motive would have been? which is not relevant
here? but the effect? the impact of the statute is to put a
tremendous burden on the minor,

A tremendous burden that the

minor would not have in any other circumstance,,
One of -the equal protection issues in this case is
the fact that the statute — the new statute that was passed
last summer **«• allows a pregnant minor to consent to e.ny other
procedure except abortion or sterilization»

And if the State

interests are so strong in the abortion area? then why are they

)

not strong for ©very other form of treatment?
A minor can consent to all forms of prenatal care
and surgery under that statute„

A minor could consent even to

a major operation, such as a Caesarean section? under the new

36

statute, without having to go to court0

A minor has to go to

court for no other type of procedure v/hich is accepted under
the medical rights statute that was passed last summer.
QUESTION! Do you think ilie plaintiff in this, case
would have had standing to attack the statute if* in fact, her
parents had consented or would have consented if she asked
•them?
MR® LUCAS s

I would not ~ if her parents held

consented, I would think she had no standing®
QUESTION; Well* then, don't you think the Si,ate has
quite a legitimate objection to the district court's refusal
>

to divulge to -the State, which was defending the action, the
names of the parents?

Because, really, all we have is tire

assertion of the plaintiff that her parents didn't consent®
The State never had an opportunity to examine the parents and
see whether perhaps they might have consented®
MR. LUCAS:

Well, our position was that disclosure

of the patient's name and bringing the parents into the case
would have been unscess ary because of oilier parties with
standing in the case, and it would have been destructive and
damaging to the patient®
QUESTION:

And yet you said a moment ago that if

her parents had in fact consented, she wouldn't have standing
to bring the case®
MR® LUCAS:

That's true, she would not have been

37

harmed by the statute at all.
QUESTIONS

And the Stata was never able to find

out,, in affect, whether she had standing? because they weren't
permitted to examina her parents as to whther they world have
consantedo
MR* LUCAS;

If her parents had been willing to

consent, then -there would have been no reason for her to become
involved in the litigation, and to have taken such cars to
avoid exposure of her name®

Ordinarily in a lawsuit you're entitled to examine the

MR® LUCAS;

In this case the

you've already made in all of these briefs a strong case* and
I think accurately, that this is a period of great stress;
she's afraid to tell her parents»
It also strikes me* so that

I can take it as common

more rapport than they anticipated»
MR» LUCASs

In many cases that would

We

have a great deal -QUESTION;

So how can you generalise, as you were,

saying that the court could decide, in talking with her,
whether, in fact her parents were likely to consent?
MR» LUCAS:
Rehnquist's question»

Perhaps I misunderstood Mr» Justice
I thought his question was whether the

parents may have in fact already consented»

And if the

parents held already consented or would have been willing to
consent —

I think what he was probing at and what

I'm concerned about is how do we know that the parents would
not have consented, and that there would have

QUESTION:

We simply do not -- we do not know that»
Well, isn't that the business of the

courts, to find out before -they bring a matter to this stage
of litigation?

39
MR* LUCASs Well, with other parties who had standing
in the litigation, it was not really necessary» I think the
district court determined that her right not to have her
parents notified was of sufficient privacy and constitutional
dimension to justify the limited inquiry in her particular
case»

And that —
QUESTIONS

Well, the standing of these other parties

is not yet resolved, of course, with finality»
MR» LUCASs

That’s true»

Well, the physician in

particular, we feel that his standing was recognized in Doe v»_
Bolton, and that that would be clear on that particular issue»
And the court did make a rule allowing intervenors
to participate in the case»

The intervenors ostensibly

represented the parents of minors who could become pregnant,
v/ho might become pregnant, and want to obtain abortions in
Massachusetts 0
So there were two sets of attorneys on the other
side to protect any possible interest»

I don't see how another

third set of attorneys for the parents could have affected the
presentation of -the litigation or the outcome, in view of the
standing of the other parties»
QUESTION:

Well, we’ll never know that, will we?

MR» LUCAS:

That’s true»

Also the court addressed

the case in tarns of the statute on its face, rather than as
applied to this particular minor»

And the court made an express determination that this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY LUCAS

ESQ0,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRo

LUCAS:

Thank you, Your Honor»

Earlier in the day, the question was raised whether
there were pending any malpractice battery cases on the subject
of abortion for minors? and we would call the Court's attention
to Footnote 5 of the Motion to Affirm and Brief filed by the
^

Appellees in this case, which cites a case pending in Vermont0
It's the only one we know of»

We have looked to see if there

were any others»
The case was pending in the Superior Court and is
being certified to -the Supreme Court of Vermont for argument
in May by mutual stipulation of the parties»

pamph 1st.

QUESTION:

You refer to 5 on page ■—

MR» LUCAS:

Footnote 5 on page 4 of the green

Bogart vsVermont womunjs Health Center»
Vermont has no statute requiring parently consent,,

In this case 'tie uncontested stipulation shows that the minor
changed her mud.

after her parents found out about her having

an abortion, and feat the parents have sued for battery*
We were discussing the abstention doctrine»

The

Appellees were particularly

concerned with the cases of Lake

Carriers* Association and Harris County CoBimissignersj the
latter being from the last term..

And we would refer the Court

to -the language in Lake Carriers about abstention being
invoked only in very special circumstances, which justify 'the
delay and the expenses

And to Harris Comity , which indicated

•that if th© State courts would be likely to construes riie
statute to avoid, the constitutional question, it has been our
feeling that there is insufficient evidence to indicate that
the State courts would be able to resolve the constitutional
questions in this particular instance»
The idea of a 14 or 15 or 16-year-old being able to
make her way through the maze of State or federal courts is —
particularly with her parents on the other 'side, and her not
even being able to have access to legal service's representa­
tion, since the Federal Legal Services Corporation Ad; bans
the use of those funds in representing anyone to help obtain
an abortione

I think, from a very practical standpoint, it

would be an insuperable burden for most minors, and a burden
which is not

imposed an any other form of medical care or

any other constitutional righto
There were four days of testimony in this case, in
an effort to sift out, with numerous experts, the underlying
factual issues which are so sensitive and so important in the
cass

44

Mary Moe testified in camera, before the three «judge
federal court»

They made an express finding that she had made

a considered decision to have an abortion» She had had two hours
of counseling from the registered nurse at the clinic» She
had received materials from a county health clinic- perhaps
over forty days before»

There was a period in the record of

43 days which passed before her pregnancy test could be
positive, before it could be determined, in which she had an
opportunity to give thought and give consideration to th©
subject»
The Interveners had a child psychiatrist sit in on
her testimony, and it is perhaps significant that the child
psychiatrist, when he testified at the trial, did not in even
one sentence question her competency and her ability to consent
to the procedure.»
QUESTION s

Do you think a minor girl would have a

causa of action against a doctor who, either because of the
statute or independent of any statute, refused to perform the
procedure without the consent of the parents?
MR» LUCAS;

No, Your Honor, I do not think

I do

not 'think that she would unless, in a very rare set of circum­
stances *— I think th© physician would have an obligation to
refer her somewhere else if possible, and if that place were
known, and he may be liable for not referring»
Bui: a physician has his own individual right»

QUESTIONS But a doctor who is concerned about the
malpractice aspect, and the prob 1 cam of taking on -the burden of
proving later that a 12-year-old girl
consent, could simply says

gave an informed

Without the consent of the parents,

I won't have anything to do with it,
MRs LUCAS s

I think a doctor could do thai;0

And I

■chink some doctors do and some doctors will, even in — in
jurisdictions where the question is up in the air, I think
that has often been the case»

And in many hospitals, that

has often bean the case»
I think a great many people are awaiting the outcom©
of this litigation from the Court, because of the veryimportant problems that have come up with teenagers wanting
access to abortion and access to contraception, and physicians
being concerned as to whether they can legally, without risk

of litigation, provide them with that»

While the issue of

civil remedies is not specifically raised in the case, I
think a great many people will be looking to this decision to
see 'whether a physician could recognize a minor's constitutional
right and perform an abortion on a minor, or provide a minor
with contraceptives who did not have parental consent,,
It's fairly clear in federal family planning programs
because they provida that in family planning services — at
least in so far as contraception is concerned, will bo provided
without regard to age

46

QUESTION:

Mr. Lucas, could I ask you a question

that's run through my mind as I've listened to the argument?
Do you suppose a statute would be constitutional that
required 'the consent of both parents before a child could
obtain a tattoo?
MR. LUCAS:

That's a very interesting question,,

I would think that it would — the child's right in
this particular case would not nearly rise to the stature that
the right of access to abortion rises, it would be ~ a
tattoo would be something more of a whimsical nature? but,
on the other hand, there are a lot of constitutional protections
extended to —
QUESTION:

Well, you know, wa don't always think, for

example, growing long hair is whimsical in nature? that's been
given constitutional protection, at least in some circuits0
I wonder if the right to affect one's appearance by
having some kind of a special emblem on an arm or something
like that might be somewhere«
MRo LUCAS;

I think that’s really ’the kind of case

that could go either way, and it could — it’s the kind of
case that would go depending on what rights were eventually
recognised to -things such as hair and personal appearance„
And I’m aware of Your Honor's position in the Seventh Circuit
on the hair question.
And it would bs our position -chat if the right of

47
personal appearance were recognized as a fundamental right,
then the minor would be able to do this without parental
consent.
QUESTIONs
MR. LUCASt

Without parental consent, yes.
It may be, on the other hand, that

there’s no substantial reason for forbidding her or him to
have a tattoo or something of that nature.
QUESTION:
war symbol?

What if it's a peace symbol or an anti"*

Would it get the First Amendment involved, in the

tattoo then?
MR. LUCAS:

That could be — that could come up in

something very similar to the Tinker context.

It wou! d be

our feeling that while the plaintiffs in the Tinker case were
on the same side as their parents, that the parents could
not have eradicated the impact' of this Court’s decision
in Tinker, by saying that they would not consent to their
children engaging in those activities f particularly with 'the
State backing them up with criminal sanction.
I don’t, think the school could have said that only
those minors whose parents will give them written permission
to demonstrate or wear armbands will be permitted to do so.
I think this would apply in 'the In re Gault area,
too, that parents could not conduct and control and waive
constitutional rights of a minor in a juvenile offender
proceeding.

48
QUESTIONs

Well, what if — to follow up on Justice

Stevens8 question — instead of just wanting to wear an armband,
|

they wanted to have an armband tattooed in such a way that
there was

medical evidence to suggest there was some danger

attached»

Now, would your answer still be the same?
HR. LUCAS;

I think my answer would b© different in

a case like 'that, that the State itself could theoretically
bah tattooing if there were evidence of hepatitis outbreaks
and things of that nature.
If there were no evidence whatsoever of it being
harmful to the minor, that would be a whole different story.
QUESTION;

Let me male© it a little easier or harder,

)
then.

What about the girls having their ears pierced for

earrings'?
MR. LUCAS;

That again gets in the same area as the

personal appearance and the hair area»

I don't know what the

outcome of that would be in this Court, but it's a right that
.is not as important to minors as the right of control over
their reproductive freedom, their right of access to abortion.
The thing said in this Court's opinion about the dangers to —
QUESTION:
)

Well, there; is danger of infection in

ear piercing, as you know.
MR. LUCAS;

Yes.

And I’m not so sure —

Sometimes less so when a nurse does it

than when a physician does it.

49

I wouldn’t, be surprised at that.

you just say the consent entirely is ~~
MR, LUCAS:

We*re not — we clearly feel that the

consent of one parent is just as unconstitutional as requiring
the consent of both.

That with the both you have the problem

of arbitrary reasons or no reasons or unreasonable reasons
from two different people.
QUESTION:

It comes to

But you don’t think -the two consent

requirement really changes the constitutional issue?
MR. LUCAS:

No, I don’t,

QUESTION:

Okay. I just wanted to be sure.

QUESTION;

Mr. Lucas, before you qo on, I suppose

Massachusetts has a customary law requiring parental consent
for a minor to marry?
MR. LUCAS;

Yes# Your Honor, that’s true.

QUESTION;

What I wanted to ask your opinion about,

it was addressed in the case that preceded yours , is whether
you think the reasoning, the rationale of a three-judge court
in your case, if adopted by us, would necessitate the
invalidating of the Massachusetts consent to marriage statute?
MR. LUCAS:

I do not think it would.

I agree

precisely with what Mr. Susman said, that this right is a more

50
important.* a more fundamental lasting right* and that -the
State interest in preventing young marriages are much more
compelling.

In fact* they are on the other sida0

He re X

don’t tliink the State has any substantial interest in preventing
a minor from having access to an abortion v?hen she can give
an informed consent* and there’s no danger of medical problems
But the State can offer a lot of compelling reasons
for postponing the age of marriage* and it’s just a brief
postponement.

The same would apply to the right to vc fee„

QUESTION;

The State reasons suggested have; included

the parental interest in the child's welfare*
MR. LUCAS;
QUESTION;

That would not be —~
It would be true in both instances* I

take it* consent to marriage and consent to abortion*
MR. LUCAS;

Yes* Justice Powell* we would -- we

realise that’s one that has been offered* but we don’t think
-that that, interest independently would support the res triction
on the right to marriage.; that that interest is one of many
interests.

And that in this particular case the parents'

interest does not outweigh the minor’s interest; in that case
the parents’ interest and a lot of other interests outweigh
the minor’s interest in becoming married.
There are a great many reasons. The impact on
education and the economic condition of minors for getting
married when they’re very young; the high divorce rate. And

51
there are a lot of those factors which could be used to
justify the age»
)

We've located in the record the testimony or -the
subject of minors that were 12, 13, 14 and 15, and there were
statements from two of our very experienced experts to the
effect that — for example, Dre Hodgson, at page 79, stated
that some 12-year-olds will be more mature than 18-year-olds»
And at page 176, Dr„ Carol Nadelson, who was a psychiatrist
in the field, stated that ,5on@ can find a 13-y@ar~old who is
better able to make a decision them a 17-year-old,,"
?uid Dr» Somers Sturgis, who has been active in the

^

adolescent medicine field for a long time, testified at the
very outset of his testimony that age was simply no criterion,
no conclusive criterion of maturity,
QUESTION!

Well, isn't it true that some 18-year-olds

and 17-year-olds know more than 21-year-olds?

If so, why

can't they get married without consent?
MR» LUCAS?. Because of the otrier State interest that
justifies drawing some line at some point in —
QUESTION:

Well, I don't see any difference in the

State interest on this point, where you say that the 3,2-year-old.'
have got mors sense than some 17-year-olds»
What you mean is some exceptionally intelligent
12-year-olds have more sense than some stupid 17-year-olds»
You don't mean an average»

52
MR. LUCAS?
QUESTION:

That;.0s perfectly correct, Your Honore
So what good is it to this argument?

MR» LUCAS:

It's just to illustrate that if you ban

abortions to someone under age 14r there are going to be a few
who have — whose rights are very important to them„

They may

be members of a class that 90 percent of 'them can’t censent,- but
those other ten percent have important rights -that justify
being recognized»

And it’s ~

QUESTION:

Well# isn’t that true in every line-

drawing area# that Legislatures must deal with?
MR» LUCAS:

It does come up in the line-drawing

area situations that we’ve discussed, in the brief»

There are

just differant issues and different factors in different
cases»
Hare we’re dealing with a right that’s been recognized
as fundamental for all persons in Roe v0 Wade#

and we're

simply asserting that —
QUESTION:

Well# is not the right to marry z.

fundamental right?
MR» LUCASs

Yes# it ist Your Honor»

Certainly the

Loving case in th® —
QUESTION: But the State can regulate it»
MR» LUCAS:

We would agree with that. The Slate has

much more compelling reasons for regulating in that particular
context

53
And in Massachusetts., for example, while a marriage
is voidable fox" someone very young, a marriage of a 12-year-old
woman and a 14-year-old young man is not voids, under statute»
Eighteen may be the general age, but if someone manages to get
married at age 12 or age 14, it's valid»

It's not — it's

voidable, but, until annulled, it's not invalid»
There was also some testimony as to the practical
issues in the case, of what if a minor could not obtain
parental consent, and we refer the Court to page 76 of the
Appendix»

One of the witnesses indicated there was reason

to believe that minors would bs seeking illegal abortions»
I suppose that minors that are financially well off in
Massachusetts could cross over into Vermot, where Vermont
does not require parental consent expressly.
Referring-

to prior decisions of this Court on ‘she

rights of minors, there are certain general principles
we've been able to suggest»

that

There's no case we've encountered

which upholds the rights of parents over the rights of
minors, when they both are asserting rights of constitutional
dimension? — and I believe my time is up.
Thank you. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is 14 o'clock, p.m,, the case in the
above-antitied matter was submitted.]
