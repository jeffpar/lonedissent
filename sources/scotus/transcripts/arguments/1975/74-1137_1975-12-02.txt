MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in 74-1137, Lavine against Milne.
Mrs. Juviler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. A1W JUVILER
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MRS. JUVILER:

Mr. Chief Justice and May it

Please the Court:
This appeal presents the issue of whether
legislatively-created rebuttable presumptions in civil
esses will continue to ba hospitably treated by the Court
as long as there is some rational connection between the
facts proven and the facts presumed.
Appellant, the Commissioner of Social Services
of the State of New York, appeals to preserve hie position
that this established standard is the appropriate measure
for judging rebuttable presumptions in these cases.
It is also his position that the statute, the
presumption in Section 131-11 of New York Social Services
Law, which was declared invalid on its face by a threejudge district court on a motion for summary judgment is,
in fact, valid under the established standard.
The presumption is contained in a statute
governing eligibility for public assistance in New York
State

4
The statute provides that a person who voluntar­
ily terminates his employment or reducas his earning
capacity for the purpose of obtaining public assistance
or increasing his grant is ineligible for public assistance
for a period of 75 days.
The presumption, which was declared invalid
below, is an evidentiary rule for determining whether the
purpose of the person in quitting his job was to obtain
public assistance.
That presumption is triggered only when the
person voluntarily terminates his job and when he applies
for public assistance within 75 days.
Then and only then is he presumed to have
terminated

for the purpose of obtaining public

assistance.
The statute applies to applicants for APDC as
well as to the state-created Home Relief Program.

How­

ever, no plaintiff was &n applicant fox' APDC end the
specific statutory and regulatory provisions apply
differently in the cases of AFDC applicants.
Both parties now agree that the court belowerred in extending its order to include APDC applicants
and question nurobar 3 is no longer at issue between the
parties.
Therefore, we will address ourselves solely to

5

the application of this presumption to applicants for the
state-aided Home Relief Program.
Home Relief is the assistance provided by New
York State to persons who are not eligible for federal
categorical assistance.

That is, persons who Congress has

not deemed to be the most needy people.

And because it is

totally supported by the public money fxom the treasuries
of the state and local governments in New York, termina­
tions of eligibility are totally governed by state lav?
and the issue presented in this Court is only the validity
of that state law under the Constitution.
t

QUESTION:

It is only the validity of the

presumption, is it not?
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Not of the substantive law that

disallows Horne Relief for somebody who has quit his job
for the purpose of going on Home Relief.
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION;
substantive lav?.

That is correct.

J

For the first 75 days, not the

That is not. in issue here, is it?

MRS. JUVILER:

Well, that is the precise form

of the order, is to declare the presumption invalid but as
a practical matter, it precludes this very-sensitivelydrafted statute from
QUESTION:

having a practical effect.
Well. I may be a little obtuse, but

6

as you go on in your argument, maybe you can clarify it for
me.

I felt the other side of the coin is that, as a

practical matter, invalidating this presumption is not very
important, so long as the substantive lav/ remains in
effect, if the applicant has the burden of proof in any
event.
MRS. JUVILER:
t.hing3

Yes, your Honor.

One of the

that we find amazing about this case is that the

court below found this presumption to violate the plaintiff
class' rights because if one reads the statute which clearly
says that ha has the burden of coming forward and proving
each element of eligibility —
QUESTION:

Right.

MRS. JUVTLER:

— in any event, the presumption

merely clarifies and makes explicit his duty to do so and
promotes uniformity of application throughout the state.
It does not add any burdensome procedural impediment to
his obtaining public assistance.
QUESTION:

Well, that is what I gathered from

reading the brief3 and if that is so, then the invalidation
of the presumption does not hurt the state's position
very much, dees it?
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

If at all.

MRS. JUVILER:

Yes, it does, your Honor.

7
QUESTION:

Hovr?

MRS. JUVILER:
that it is an injunction.
of Social

The major reason that it does is
The Appellant# the Commissioner

Services# and his agents in the local departments

are. now enjoined from enforcing this presumption, which
means that they are enjoined from requiring a person to
corns forward and produce evidence of why he terminated his
employment.
QUESTION:

Well, if the substantive lav; remains

wholly valid that a person is not eligible for Home Relief
if he# for the first 75 days after the termination of his
employment, if he has terminated his employment for the
purpose of going or; Home Relief.
He has to prove his eligibility.

He has the

burden of proof.
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

That is correct# your Honor.

And that remains trie under this

Court decision, whether or not it is going through the
motions of invalidating this statutory presumption and if
that is true# what difference does it make?
MR. JUVILER:

The difference that it makes is

as follows:
There is an injunction against Appellant from
specifical3.y requiring a person to produce evidence of the
purpose.

Therefore# while there is a general duty to

3

produce each element of evidence to prove each element of
eligibility, the eligibility under 131.11, that is, the
purpose for which you terminated your employment, cannot
be produced or at least there is a considerable cloud on
a local agent who requires a production on the one hand or
on the other who made a determination unfavorable to the
applicant when the record was silent as to his purpose.
That is the effect — that is the effect of the
presumption.
Mow, while we agree with the court that the
presumption did not add to the procedural burdens, when a
court invalidates a statute and enjoins a party, he is put
under
at his peril to continue to operate/the underlying statute
in which he could impose that duty because he is subject
to contempt.
I want to note that there has already been an
effort to find Appellant in contempt in this case.
QUESTION:

An applicant for Home Relief still

has the burden of proving his eligibility, does he not?
MRS. JUVILER:

I believe that that will be up

to this Court to determine —
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that correct an a matter

of New York law?
MRS. JUVILER:

Yes, except the injunction in

this case raises very considerable doubt.

9

QUESTION:

Isn't that correct as a matter of

general law?
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

An applicant for anything has to

prove his eligibility for what he wants.
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, the.t is correct.

I take it that you are saying to U3

now that this injunction does, in fact, impinge upon
substantive law.
MRS. JUVILER:

Yes, I think it makes it

effective because of the nature of this very sensitive
statute.

Since the statute is only invoked when the

person has terminated his employment for the purpose of
obtaining public assistance, the next question for the
legislature is, how do you measure a. person's purpose?
And since it is always matters that are totally
within his control, they place the burden explicitly on the
applicant to produce credible evidence of his purpose, that
his purpose was not to obtain public assistance when he
quit his employment and without the presumption — whether
the presumption as explicitly written and clarified under
the legislative program or the general rules of law which
would enable the local administrator tc enforce such a
presumption, without the ability of the local administrator
tc put the specific burden of proof on the applicant, this

10

statute is unworkable.
QUESTION:

Well, let me just try one more time

and then —
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Right.

— IE11 try to step bothering you

then and in the course of your argument maybe you can
explain it.
Had there never been this presumption ss a
matter of Nev, York law —
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Yes?

— it wouldn't have — the applicant

would have still had the burden of proving his eligibility.
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And in fact, the law generally would

have been as though this presumption were written into
the law.

Wouldn't it?
MRS. JUVILER:

That is correct, your Honor.

The

local agency could have required him to produce the
evidence.
QUESTION:

Right.

Had there never been any

statutory presumption.
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

The only

—

And, therefore, never been this law­

suit .
MRS. JUVILER:

Yes.

11
QUESTION:

The applicant still has to prove

his eligibility.
MRS. JUVILER:
still could

That is cur position., that he

be required to.

The only difference the

presumption made, and it is a subtle difference and I do
not say that it is constitutional import, that is tha whole
weight of our argument, that the court below had no grounds
whatsoever to find that this presumption violated anybody's
constitutional rights but the only difference the
presumption made was that it clarified this specific duty
and it promoted uniformity throughout the district and
considering the complicated administrative scheme we are
talking about, that is not an insignificant matter.
QUESTION:

Is there any reason why New York

couldn't have provided that no person should be eligible
for home aid until

75 days after he voluntarily quit his

job, period?
MP3. JUVILER:
your Honor.

There certainly is no reason,

Our near neighbor, New Jersey, does have that

requirement.

They say that any applicant for aid for the

families of the working poor are ineligible for assistance
after voluntary termination for 20 days.
Furthermore, in the federal APDC Program for
unemployed fathers, the entire family is ineligible for
assistance for 30 days, irrespective of whether the person

12

voluntarily terminated or whether ha was fired, as long as
after termination of employment he wa3 ineligible for 30
days so that there are parallel statutory schemes to say
nothing of numerous parallel regulatory schemes which
provide just that.
QUESTION:

So the New York schema is actually

more liberal in that regard than, say, New Jersey —
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

Right.

— if you have correctly described

New Jersey.
MRS. JUVILER:

That is correct and, indeed, I

think that anyone looking at this statutory scehroe sees
the very narrow road that our legislature travelled.
could have dene what Arisona and

They

Delaware did and said

that no employable person is eligible for the state's
general assistance or they could have done what New Jersey
ana the Federal Government did and say that nobody is
eligible after a voluntary termination of employment or
they could have said, nobody is elegible after a voluntary
termination for the purpose of obtaining public assistance.
And they did not do any of those things.

They

said, a person is elegible who voluntarily terminates for
the purpose of obtaining

public assistance after 75 days

so that this is a very, very permissive statute and that is
why the essential of the evidentiary rule that is present

13
here is so important because it is the only thing that
allows this permissive statute to have any practical
effect because if you switched the burden and imposed the
burden on the State Department and the local agencdes to
prove purpose, you would have completely shackled them and
I want to point out that Appellees do suggest that, the
state agency and the local department have an easier time
proving the purpose with which the applicant left his
employment than ~ than the employment.
I think that it is plain that the applicant,
no matter how uneducated and how poor he may be is in a
better position to tell the agency why he quit his job
than, the agency, with all the learning in the world, is able
to tell him why he quit his job.
QUESTION:

In this particular case the Plaintiffs

don't seem to have quit their jobs.

They seam to have

been fired.
MRS. JUVILER:

'Sen, your Honor.

That is

correct.
The problem in this cases was not whether the
Plaintiffs ha<$ s complaint.

I think there ere two problems

in this cess that were net really at issue.
It is clear that the main Plaintiffs, except for
Joseph Beverly, had a very serious complaint and it is also
clear that the statute of which they were complaining was

14

obviously valid by all the rules of procedural and sub­
stantive due process that have ever been enunciated by any
court who seriously gave it a moment's thought.
And the problem that this case created was a
terrible mix-up of these two things.
One, the Plaintiffs had this complaint about the
application statute and the court,probably

impatient

because of the serious misapplication of the statute,
decided to knock cut the presumption..
Knocking out the presumption did not help
Milne, Streeter or Lee.
QUESTION:

It didn't, right,

MRS. JUVILER;
applied to them.

Because the presumption was not

They were fired from their jobs.

QUESTION:

Well. they were victims of mal­

administration by the State of New York under the statute.
MRS. JUVILER:

Yes, we —■ wall, we don’t even

concede that it is under the statute.
QUESTION:

Well —

MRS. JUVILER:

It flier so much in the face of

the statute.
QUESTION:

They were victims of unfair

administration of the lav/.
MRS. JUVILER:

Administration of the law without

e question and we are not here defending that

15
maladministration —
QUESTION:

Right.

MRS. JUVILER:

We have separated ourselves from

it since the very beginning.

Indeed, the local commissioner

was separately represented and the decision below came down
in which the presumption was invalidated on its face.
He did not appeal because there was no finding
against him.

The only thirr that really we are here

defending is the statute wV _oh really did not causa any of
the. hardships that ar© outlined below and that is exactly
the posture of this case, Mr. Justice Stewart.
I want to point out why the presumption is
inherently rational.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Juviler, Mr. Justice Stewart is

correct that it wouldn't make any difference whether the
presumption is in or out of the case.

Then there is hardly

any case or controversy about that statute and the District
Court should never had adjudicated it and in this event,
you would vacate and dismiss the case.
MRS. JUVILER:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor —

And you wouldn't really care about

that, would you?
MRS. JUVILER:

You mean about this presumption,

particularly?
QUESTION;

Well, I mean the judgment of

16

unconstitution&lity would be vacated.
MRS. JUVILER:

If we talk about the second

phrase, yes, that is true, except for the fact that it isn't
the presumption.
First of all, the presumption was deemed
necessary by the legislature.

It may seem petty at this

stage when we ere in this high court to discuss the minor
service that it. performs of clarification and uniformity
but. the legislature did deem it necessary and did formally
in its sovereign power enact

this presumption.

Therefore, for a court to enjoin it and declare
it invalid, they have to be something unconstitutional and
that very decision itself demands reversal.
Secondly, the presumption as the phrase in the
statute itself may not be essential but the idea of the
presumption is essential, the idea that the person can be
forced to have the burden of proof, the burden of coming
forward and, in. the presence of silence on that subject,
he car. be deemed tc have terminated for the purpose of
obtaining public assistance,
Those are the three functions of the presumption
and those are not frivolous.
Sc those are the two reasons why this appeal
is here.

I understand your Honors' impatience with such

an innocuous presumption and it is, frankly — been our

17
impatience from the beginning of the case.

If we had been

more pEtient, maybe we would not be here.
I do want — because we ■— our very obviously
valid presumption was declared invalid, I don’t want to
miss ray opportunity to explain to you why, in very simple
terms, it is valid and that is that the relationship
between the facts proved in the voluntary termination and
the early application for public assistance, why they have
an internal rationality and it is clear that income from
income from employment is sc important to us all, rich,
middle class, poor, that we do not forego that major
source of income without some idea cf where our next source
of income will come. If, after voluntarily giving up that
one major source of income, we shortly thereafter appear
and apply for another major source of income, it is
rational within the terms of the constitutional rule to
assume that the reason that we gave up the one source of
income was to make ourselves eligible for the second source
cf income, as long as we'have an opportunity to present
evidence to the contrary if this was not the case.
Secondly, there is a temporal relationship
between these two actions whi ch has long bean the basis of
many rebuttable presumptions which era cited in our brief
and in many future administrative schemes it is important
v

that this device not ba clouded by a decision such as that

18

rendered by the coart below.
Therefore, it is clear that this rebuttable
presumption allows for the individualized determinations
which this Court has so long favored.
Irrebuttable presumptions have been criticized
just because they do not provide that kind of individualized
determinations and it is surprising to be found here, having
to defend under the due process, clause the very indivi­
dualized determinations which have so long been held up as
an example.
The Appellees also claim that the presumption
is invalid under the equal protection clause.
While the court below did not reach that
question, analysis under the equal protection clause only
makes

cogent the validity of this presumption.
First of all, the equal protection standard is

the same standard as the due process standard of
rationality.
Secondly, if we look at the classifications in
the statute, we see how reasonable the statute is.

The

distinctions are between people who quit their jobs and
people who don't

quit their jobs, very closely related to

the purposes of the statute, which is to deter people from
leaving their jobs without the means of subsistence in the
near future, tc encourage them to provide for themselves in

19

the near future and to limit the finite resources of the
state to people most in need.
And the second classification under the statute
is the difference between people who recently quit their
employment and became eligible for public assistance and
those who not-so-recently quit their jobs to become
eligible.
Both of those are not attackable as classifi­
cations which could in any conceivable sense violate the
equal protection clause.
I do want to point out that the procedures for
dealing with the presumption are also at issue here in a
limited sense.

The Mobile Turnipseed

rule, which is the

rule of rationality which we have discussed, is a two-fold
rule.
One, it requires that a presumption have a
rational relationship between the facts proven and the
facts presumed.
And the second part of that rule is that there
must be an opportunity to rebut.
Well, the court below did not find that there
wa3 not an opportunity to rebut,

There were soma footnotes

which made some suggestions that we feel were unjustified
end, furthermore, to demonstrate the clear validity of
this presumption, we aid discuss the procedure for

20

rebuttal in our brief and they were framed as question
number two.
However, that question only relates to the
statute and regulations on their face, not as to the
statute and regulations as applied which were issues of
fact debated in the court below and net available for a
decision on summary judgment.
In general, we should look at the context of
these hearingsc

This is an administrative proceeding for

application for state-created benefits and that the
procedure before the social services department is
informal and the hearing regulations —- the regulations
regarding that informal procedure make it clear that no
finding of ineligibility can he rendered without a fair
opportunity given to the applicant to rebut.
Furthermore, that decision is subject to
supervisory review.

In all respects it meets the standards

of Torres versus New York State Labor Department and those
standards are stricter than are necessary in this case
which is an application proceeding.
Furthermore, there is a fair hearing procedure
in the state court which is regulated new and during the
entire pendency of this suit by an order of Judge Motley
of the Southern District Court in a case in which
applicants all were members of the class protected, Kelson

21
versus Sugarman
Therefore, we regard this presumption as a
clearly valid exercise of the legislature's prerogative to
establish evideiitiary rules and as such, we request that
the decision below be reversed in all respects.
I'd like to reserve my additional time for
rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr, Norlander,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD A. NGRLASD2R, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. FORLAHDER:

Mr. Chief Justice and May it

Please the Court:
The record shows that 21 needy persons were
sanctioned due to the operation of the statutory pre­
sumption. .
My adversary contends in her reply brief now
that 20 out of those 21 persons did not actually terminate
their employment and I will turn to that question a little
later. Since my adversary does concede at page 5 of the
reply brief that the presumption was proparly applied in
the case of Plaintiff Beverly, I shall turn first to the
question of the rationality of the prescription used against
him.
QUESTION:

In your view, Mr. Norlander, could the

22

legislature of a state constitutionally provide that no one
would ba eligible for any benefits of any kind for 75 days?
MR. &ORLANDER:

That question, your Honor, I

believe would raise a serious problem under the equal
protection clause.
QUESTION:

I think it would be a close question.
Why would it raise any problem at

all under the equal protection clause?
MR. NORLANDER:

Well, your Honor, we are dealing

here with a benefit that has the impact of ~~ it is the
last resort for a person who is destitute.
Now, whether the creation of a class of persons
that is totally destitute and the rejection of their
request for assistance would create a class of persons
with no legitimate means of survival is a fact question
that would have to arise under the statute, under such a
statute.
I think that is probably what would happen if
such a statute were written in New York.
QUESTION:

What would you say about a state's

action in providing for no welfare whatever?
MR.

NOKLANDSR:

QUESTION:

Well —

Just no welfare program, rejecting

all matching funds of trie Federal Government and saying,
in this state we are not going to have any program.
MR. NQRLAMPER;

This Court has never held that

23
welfare is a constitutionally required benefit.
But on

the other hand, the Court has never held

that once a state offers a benefit, it may arbitrarily
withdraw or deny that benefit.
QUESTION:

Well, but supposing — taking the

Chief Justice’s question — it isn't any withdrawing of it.
It is simply saying, for 75 days after you voluntarily
quit your work, you are not eligible

for welfare.

I can't imagine that would violate the equal
protection clause.
MR. NORLANDER:
purpose that would advance,,

Well, I don't, see what rational
I think it is a close question.

The rational basis test would obviously apply in this
situation.
I think that one would probably, one might even
concede that it might be rational on its face.

Perhaps

the legislature could imagine a person who wanted to be
on welfare would be encouraged to save his money for 75
days so he could survive for that time and then he could
receive the benefits.
And legislature might conceive that that would
rationally be advanced and encouraged by such a rule but in
operation I am afraid that under such a statute I think that
experience, at least in New York State, would show that
such parsons who would be rejected would be left with

24

virtually no legitimate means of survival.
QUESTION:

Well, does the Constitution prevent

that result?
MR. NORLANDSR:

Well, but what I am saying is

that a class of persons would be formed as a result of the
operation of that statute and it is rather hypothetical at
this point.

I don't know whether that clans would exist.

It would depend upon the record in the case.
I doubt that the creation of such a class of
persons would rationally advance either the direct purposes
of the New York Social Services Law or the purposes of that
statute.
QUESTIONs

Well, but it is up to New York

legislature to decide what will advance and what will not
advance the purposes of the statute, isn't it?
MR. NORLANDER:

Well, I ’would nay that in

operation tha question would probably boil down to the
question as to whether such a classification as applied
would violate the equal protection clause.

Now, I don't —

it might be valid on its face.
But I don't see that that question is before the
Court.

Most of my adversary’s arguments tend to relate to

the justification of the fir3t sentence of the statute and
we contend that the validity of the presumption is not
measured by the validity of the substantive rule.

We — the

25

question before the Court is really whether the state has
adopted a fair or a rational means of determining who is
to be sanctioned and who is not to be sanctioned, who shall
receive assistance and who shall be sanctioned and who
shall have 75 days worth of benefits forfeited.
QUESTION:

Well, it is who should bs eligible

for Home Relief and who should not.
c»f a sanction, is it?

It is not a matter

It is a matter of

MR. NGRLRNDER;

who gets benefits.

Well, I think the record is

quite clear in this respect, Mr. Justice Stewart, that
at a very practical level we are not dealing with a label
of a sanction but we are dealing with — with —
QUESTION:

Eligibility.

MR. NQRLANDER:

1 think that the record shows

that in the case of Milne, the record at Appendix page 29;
Westbrook, at page 242, Brownlee, 304, Reid, at 291 — all
of these cases, they were sanctioned and the workers, I
believe, by the use of that, the common us® of that word,
realised that they were ir> the business of punishing these
persons for doing something that they had done wrong.
QUESTION:

hs I understand your sisters on the

other side,- they concede the maladministration of this law.
MR. NQRLANDERs

Well, I would point out, of

course —
QUESTION:

With respect to 20 out of the 21

26

Plaintiffs.
MR. NORLANDER:

Well, we don't concede that and,

in fact, they have taken a reversal of position in their
papers before the Court on that question.
Let me point out that in the main brief my
adversary says that Milne — at page 10 -- "Was denied
assistance by the Westchester County Department of Social
Services on the basis of Hew York Social Services Law 131(11)
cn November 16, the day he applied."
And in the jurisdictional statement at page 9,
virtually the same statement is made by my adversary.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Nor 1 ar.der, the mal­

administration in this case is not before us, is it?
MR. NORLANDER:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe

that the maladministration of the —
QUESTION:

I thought the only thing before us

was the knocking down of the statute as being unconsti­
tutional?
MR. NORLSNDER:

Well, one of the questions

presented by my adversary's jurisdictional statement is
whether Plaintiffs had a fair opportunity to rebut it.
We contend that the record shows f not mal­
administration, but the lack of a fair opportunity to
rebut the presumption and the particular vice of an
arbitrary presumption is that innocent persons, who no one

27

applying commonsense and experience to the facts of the
case would ever sanction —
QUESTION:

Well —

MR. NORLANDER:
QUESTION:

— on this kind of point.

— as to the people you represent,

They were fired.

QUESTION:

point I don't see any difference.

For this

And you don't expect the

welfare people to come to than and say, "Here is the money.
They have to go and
MR. NORLANDER;
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And don’t they have to "qualify"?

MR. NORLANDER:
QUESTION:

ask for it, don't they?

Oh, yes.

Ordinarily —

And if administering the qualifica­

tions standards the officer dees wrong, is that ground for
knocking out the statute?
Yes or no.
MR. NORLANDER:
QUESTION:

It —

The answer is no, isn't it?

MR. NORLANDER:

The answer is sometimes yes if

the statute as applied is applied in an unconstitutional
or an arbitrary manner.
QUESTION:

Well, this statute war. not knocked

out as applied, was it?

28

MR. NORLANDER:

The district court judgment held

that the statute was unconstitutional on its face.
QUESTION:

I thought so.

And. that is not

before us.
MR. NORLANDER;
QUESTION:

Well, I — the question of the —

The validity, fecial validity of the

statute is what is before vis.
MR. NORLANDER:

That is before the Court, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And what else?

MR. NORLANDERs

And the Plaintiffs have urged

all along through this case in their motion for 'summary
judgment and it war explicitly mentioned that we moved to
have the presumption declared unconstitutional, both on its
face and as applied and the critical claim in the
application of the presumption is that Plaintiffs were
denied a fair opportunity to rebut the presumption because
they were denied an effective opportunity to have the
hearing, which was delayed and my adversary raises that
question specifically in question two, the jurisdictional
statement where she asks this Court to determine whether
Plaintiffs were given a fair opportunity to rebut the
presumption.
QUESTION:

Is your second point the absence of

a fair opportunity to rebut the presumption based on the

29

facts of this case or is it a challenge to the procedure
prescribed by regulations?
In other words, are wa talking here about
validity of a statute or a regulation ox maladministration
of the statute with respect to these particular claimants?
MR. NORLANDERi

Well, the facts

in the record

illustrate the problem but our contention is that the
applicable regulations and laws are not really in dispute
and we have a situation where there is no law or
regulation requiring the defendant to notify people even
of the existence of the presumption, nor, obviously, ere
people advised how to rebut or what kind of evidence rebuts
it and that the hearings — the only hearings they are
offered by regulationt by statute, ere —• need not be
decided, again by regulation, until up to 90 days.
QUESTION;

How does the burden to establish

eligibility differ from the burden to rebut the presumption?
MR. NORLANDER:
clear in the Beverly* case.

I think the record is' quite
It, obviously revery applicant

has the burden of coming forward to submit information.
He fills out the application form.

He has the

obligation to’answer any question that is asked about that.
He has the obligation to produce verification.
QUESTION:

And is one cf the things he must

show,that he did not voluntarily leave his job?

30

MR. NORLANDER;

Well, obviously he will be

asked why he left his employment.

If he 3ays, "I left in

order to qualify for public assistance," I assume there
would ba no naed for the presumption.
On the other hand, it is quite clear in the
record of the Beverly case that the mere fact of recent
employment termination is given sufficient probative weight
to carry the presumed fact and that is why we are here
today.

It is not because Plaintiffs are being asked about

why they quit work.
In fact, the postjudgment instructions issued
by the Defendant there appear at the very last page of ray
brief on page lc, actually, near the bottom of the page.
The implementing instructions now in force:, as
I understand it, direct the intake v?orkar that they are
not deny assistance unless he finds, and I quote, "From
all available evidence as a fact that the applicant or
recipient has quit his or her employment

for the purposes

of qualifying for public assistance."
QUESTION:

Was that issued pursuant to the

mandate or order of the court in this case?
MR. NORLANDER:

Yes, your Honor.

In the framing

of the instructions after the judgment there was a colloquy
in the district court and the District Judge Wyatt indicated
that that wa3 what the Court meant when it issued the

31
injunction that from now on, if there is to be a sanction
imposed, it should ba based upon the coruaonsense and
experience of the case worker and they shouldrft use

QUESTION:

if there is a hearing at some time, maybe 90 days, mayba —
well, whenever it is, if the applicant wins, I take it

when he should have been paid.
MR. NORLANDSR;
QUESTION:

That is quite right.

Under the state law.

MR. NORLANDER:

That is right.

What v/e are

32
talking about here is that — we are not talking only
about $94 a month, which is tha basic grant plus shelter
for the individuals who appeared in the case because
obviously, if there is a mistaken denial, as the record
shows, the fair hearing process corrected a number of those
and quite effectively.

Except that, wa are not just

talking about $94, we are talking about what the use of
that means to the Plaintiffs and — yes?
QUESTION:
whether they

I understand that but I just asked

did gat back pay or not?

MR. NORLANDSR:
QUESTION':

Yes.

And they did.

MR. NORLANDER:

Yes.

Yes.

Plaintiffs contend — and contrary to what my
adversary contends ■— that the rational connection test
denounced by this Court in. Mobile . versus Tumipsaed does
require affirmance of the judgment below.
The Court said in Mobile that there must be a
rational connection between the given facts and the facts
presumed and the Court consistently has relied upon
conunonsense and common, experience to determine whether
statutory presumptions satisfy the requirements of due
that
process and/rational connection has been found lacking
where it cannot be said that the presumed fact more likely
than not follows the given facts.

33

The question thus framed for this case, we
believe, is whether it is more likely than not that the
Plaintiffs terminated employment not for other reasons, but
for the purpose of qualifying for public assistance.
We contend that commonsense end general
experience teaches that people ordinarily do not terminate
their employment in order to qualify for welfare benefits,
but rather, for — in order to resolve ordinary on-the-job
conflicts, health problems, transportation problems, any
number of

other problems that a person would leave his

employment for.
The Defendant himself recognises these ordinary
i

reasons and rules in the regulations and rules that he has
promulgated in which he tacitly concedes that people who
quit work due to illness, conflicts with their supervisors,
strikes, discrimination, people who even have expectation
of finding another job but don't find it — he concedes
that those are not -- parsons who do that are not properly
subject to the sanctions.
We contend thait those reasons demonstrate the
irrationality of the presumption.
QUESTION:

Mr. Norlander, assuming that a man

applies for Home Relief and the worker says to him, "Did
you quit your job within the last 75 days?" and he says,
"Yes."

She says, "Why?"

Isn't he obliged to say why?

MR. NORLANDERs
QUESTION:

Yes, he is.

Isn't he obliged to give, in great

detail, why?
MR. NORLANDER;
QUESTION:

Certainly.

And the difference between that and

the presumption is what?
MR. NORLANDER:

The presumption allows the

worker to really cease the inquiry at the time when it. has
found that the person recently terminated employment.
The fact of recent employment, termination is
given sufficient weight to allow presumption of the given of the presumed fact and as I think the record demonstrates
the accuracy of making these subjective determinations by
welfare case workers is less than satisfactory and it is
the — the element of error is very, very high in this cs.se
The — I would point out that if one would
review the notices given to most of the Plaintiffs, we
could sae that the 75-day period was generally calculated
as well as most people calculate periods of time but the
20 out of 21 instances — the Defendant concedes — the.
subjective purpose was erroneously determined.
QUESTION:

If an applicant were asked whether

he quit work to receive relief and U*e applicant answered
no and that is all there was to it, and he didn’t offer any
other reason and there was no other inquiry, ivould the

36

presumption serve to reject his claim?
MR. NORLANDER:

I don't know that the pre­

sumption would be needed there to reject that claim.

If

a person refuses —
QUESTION:

Well, he just say3 — he says no, I

didn't quit work to get relief.
MR. NORLANDER:

Well, my adversary did say in

oral argument below that the presumption was necessary
because you don't have to take a person's say-so and I
suppose that the presumption operates to provide the
presumed facts merely upon the fact that the person
voluntarily terminated and the case worker is totally free
to disregard the denial under that assumption.
QUESTION:

The denial.

MR. NORLANDER:

Ky adversary contends in her

main brief at page 19 that Plaintiffs Milne, Lee, Streeter
and Beverly engaged in unusual or suspicious behavior when
they terminated their employment and requested assistance
thereafter.
I would also contend that if my adversary is
going to use the illustrations of Milne, Lee, Streeter
and Beverly insofar as the rationality of the presumption,
she tacitly concedes that they voluntarily quit or that
the presumption should have applied with them.
QUESTION:

Do any of these facts that you have

37
been talking about have anything to do with the declaration
that the statute is unconstitutional on the face?
MR. NORLANDER:

The events merely illustrate,

your Honor, with respect to the facial issue, they merely
illustrate the irrationality of the presumption.

It is

not — you are quite right — the facts with respect to
the facial claim are illustrations of what happens.

They

are illustrations of the common reasons v/hy people will
leave a job and

how they may not be able to find a new job

or how their claim for unemployment insurance benefits may
be erroneously denied.
The facts show that persons with health problems
very often terminate employment and wind up applying for
Home Relief.
And, in fact, the study shows that is the
number one rea3on why.
In evaluating the rationality of the presumption,
however, the Court has always looked to the facte in the
record and the Court has looked to the facts in the case
lav; and in the history of the similar presumptions and the
Court has looked to legislative records and to other sources
of information to ascertain whether common experience and
commonsense present day experience support a presumption
and so in that limited sense the facts in the record are
relevant to point one in our brief.

The record does show, in fact, that most of the

record of 17 years of

In fact, Joe Beverly
Plaintiff Milne had a

continuous employment and this

illustrates that the presumption was neither easy to rebut
nor rational.
Not only is it contrary to common sense that
people would leave their jobs in order to qualify for
welfare benefits, but looking at the nature of the Home
Relief program in New York in. its totality, there is
simply nothing in that program that would cause this to
depart from the common sense approach to the presumption.
The entire Home Relief program is based on
the concept of less eligibility and that means that,
generally speaking, tha progrant will be less desirable
than working for a living.

.

For instance, as a precondition for receiving
any benefits, a person must first register for any available
work and even if there is unemployment in the local
economy, he may be assigned to perform full-time work at a
public works project or work relief program for no extra
pay.
Also, the Home Relief program has a stringent
means test and the applicant must generally have depleted
all of his savings, his assets.

He may be disqualified for

39

owning an automobile.

If he has equity in a home he will

have to assign it to the Department of Social Services and
all of these facets make it very undesirable for a person
to give up personal possessions in order to qualify for
public assistance and, finally, the benefits themselves,
which are rent allowance plus $94 a month, or about $3.10
a day, are simply not the sort of benefits that would
cause: a person to ordinarily leave his employment for the
purpose of qualifying for iti
Indeed, the benefits themselves are set at a
scale to provide only for the bare necessities of life.
When one looks at the entire picture of the
Horae Relief program, the means test, the amount of
benefits, the work rules and the other factors that —the
intangible factors, perhaps, the stigma, all of these
factors when combined with the ordinary reasons for
terminating employment merely reaffirm what common sense
tells us, that people just would not quit work in. order to
qualify for the benefits.
There is no evidence in the record to support the
presumption and there is no evidence in the legislative
record to support it.
My adversary contends, at page 10 of her replybrief, that there is no evidence available on the behavior
of the Plaintiff class.

40

Plaintiffs submit that common experience and
general experience is to the contrary and that the
available empirical data actually show — the best
available information show that poor people and welfare
recipients have the same kind of attitudes toward welfare
and work as other people.
This is what the President's Commission on
Income Maintenance prograins found in 15 69 in its report.
In the President's Commission report, they said,
with respect to the question of the work attitudes of
poor people — and I quote, ,!Qur observations have
convinced us that the poor are not unlike the nonpoor.
Most of the poor want to work.

They to improve their

potential and tc be trained for better jobs.

Like most

Americans, the poor would like to do more with their lives.
QUESTION:

How does that help you when the term

used by that Commission is "Most"?

If there are a

substantial number who do otherwise, does that not 'warrant
a legislative presumption?
MR. NORLANDERs

My adversary contends that there

is no evidence available with respect to that group.
QUESTION:

But accepting this as evidence,

which is not necessarily the case, accepting it as what
someone thought about it
even as you read it to us.

doesn't support your position

41
MR. NORLANDER:

The position of the President's

Commission has been tested by a massive study in New
Jersey in which the United States Office of Economic
Opportunity spent $8 million over a three-year period to
test the precise question whether people would quit their
jobs in order to qualify for welfare benefits.
Basically, there are two ways to determine, I
guess, whether people

would quit work to qualify for

benefits.
One would be to offer them a generous benefit
without a work rule, which is what that experiment did,
and the other way is to look at people who apply for wel­
fare and find out why they are applying.
At both ends of those experiences we see that
people have not quite work in. order to qualify for welfare
benefits and that interviews of people who do apply for
welfare benefits and exhaustive studies of the reasons
why people apply for welfare benefits all come up with
common sense reasons, that people apply for welfare benefits
because they couldn't find a new job, because they weren't
covered by unemployment.
The number one reason in New York is health
reasons.
These kinds of reasons are quite independent of
any desire or motive to actually qualify for benefits.

42
Also, the experience under the work programs
has found that most of people who are asked to go out and
work actually are complying with the rule3 and so we
really Bubmit that the available information lends nothing
to support the presumption and does confirm what common
sense and common experience tell us. that the presumption
is irrational.
Plaintiffs also contend that this presumption
is an unfair rule to impose against the Plaintiffs.

In

Goldberg against Kelly, the Court stressed that fact-finding
procedures should be flexible and they should be geared to
the capacities of the parties.
We have here a class of persons who are not
highly educated and who'are not high-incone parsons.

They

are unlikely to be represented and they are unlikely to
understand a sophisticated rule of procedure- like the
presumption that was invoked against them.
The Defendant has shewn absolutely no legitimate
justification for the practical use of this presumption
and, in fact, the Defendant's

Executive Deputy Commissioner

swore in the court below —- and I quote from page 452 of
the Appendix at the bottom of the page, the very last
sentence, Executive Deputy Maher swore, "It is also clear
that the determinations are based on evidence, not on
presumption or legal conclusions„M

43
And my adversary concedes at the top of page 13
in her reply brief that it would be possible to make the
determination without the presumption.
The record shows that the presumption allows the
exercise of arbitrary power by case workers.

I do not

think that any other conclusion can be reached from
reviewing this record and the states concedes as much that
the overwhelming majority of these instances were
erroneous determinations.

Adjectives are used that the

presumption was repugnant — that the use of the presumption
was repugnant to the statute, that

I see what she means,

the first sentence of the statute.
QUESTION:

Under th© fairest and most valid law

and regulations in the world you can have maladministration
by ignorant or abusive administrators, can't you?
HR. NORLANDER:

I would agree..

I believe my tine is up.

Thank you, your

Honors.
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you —you can

answer tha question.
MR. NORLANDSR:

Your Honor, I do believe that

the fundamental concept of the rational connection test
is that it prevents sweeping in of a broad class of persons
and subjecting them to the liability imposed by the
substantive rule and I think that the record demonstrates

44
that.
Thank you.
QUESTION:
more question.

Mr. Horiandsr, let me ask you one

You, in your brief, at least, and I think

you have intimated it again today, you say that while in
terms this is a rebuttable presumption, in practical fact
it is an irrebuttable presumption because by the time the
fair hearing is held, the 75 days has passed.
MR. NORLANDER:
QUESTION:

Correct, your Honor.

Now, if that is true and if we

accept the Wigir.ore theory that an irrebuttable presumption
is not a presumption at all but merely a substantive rule
of lav;, then aren’t we faced with my brother Rehnquist’s
question, of earlier in this argument, with, i.e„, the
substantive validity of a law that says that anybody who
voluntarily terminates his employment shall be ineligible
for Rome Relief for 75 days?
Aren't we right up against that, if this is an
irrebuttable presumption?
MR. NOSLANDER:

I think not, your Honor, because

we have a situation quite unlike that in the case of
Weinberger v. Saifi decided last term.

In that case, it

is true that the presumption there amounted to a substantive
rule of law but in this case the statute does not purport
to do that, the statute purports to make an individual

45
finding of

fault.
QUESTION:

But you tell us, in fact it is

tantamount to an irrebuttable presumption.
MR. NORLAMDER:
vice.

We say that it has the same

We say that it is — however, it falls under the

rules for rebuttable presumption.
QUESTION:

You want to have it both ways.

MR. NORLAMDER:
QUESTION:

By analogy, we —

Yes.

Okay.

MR. NORLANDSR:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mrs. Juviler?
MRS. JUVILER:

Yes, I just have two things,

Mr. Chief Justice.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. AMY-JUVILER
MRS. JUVILER:

The first is, I want to point out

to the Court the regulations that existed before the
decision of the Court below which did make explicit the
way the facts were found.

They appear at — they appear

in the Appendix but they also appear more conveniently in
our brief from pages 45 through 4? and those are the
regulations with regard to this specific statute and the
general regulations for how a determination of eligibility
is made appear as an appendix to our brief at pages la
and following

46

Particularly I want to draw the Court's
attention to the provisions of Section 351.8 of 10 NYCRR
appearing at pages 4a and 5a which describe how determina­
tions of eligibility are made and which make clear that
there could be no determination of eligibility unless the
agent found that the applicant had not produced credible
evidence to overcome the presumption and furthermore, the
agent is required to make investigation and to verify all
conditions of eligibility.
With regard to the specific statute, the pre­
existing regulations gave specific examples of kinds of
reasons for leaving employment which would overcome the
presumption such as illness, payment of minimum wages and
so forth and the regulation went on and said, "local
districts, of course, should not consider this list as
exhausting the possibilities under which a voluntary or
provoked discharge is not subject to sanction but should
continue to exercise reasonable discretion considering such
factors as the lapse of time between

termination, of

employment and t’he application for assistance."
That means, something lass than 75 days, if the
difference between 60 days and 15 is substantial.
"And also, and attempt to resolve the
differences with the employer which led to the termination,
ability to identify reasons alleged for termination and

47
and so forth as judgments as to whether or not the
presumption has been overcome."
So the regulations were specific regarding the
presumption and it was only after the decision of the
court below that the determination had to be made without
regard to the burden of proof.
I also — I know that all of us have discussed
this experimental data which is a bit far afield
exhaustively for the Court and you have been very patient
but I want to point out that the major error in all the
experimental data is that they come up with the findings
that most people won't quit their jobs and most people
won't apply for public assistance.
And even if that is so, and we have no reason
to doubt it, we are dealing here only with people who did
quit their jobs and did apply for public assistance and
therefore, all of that material is

irrelevant.

Thank you vary much.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about

procedural due process7
Appellee's brief makes some very categorical
statements.

I'll read one to you.

"Plaintiffs were not

afforded a hearing of any kind at the local agency."
And another point, "Plaintiffs ware not afforded
any opportunity to rebut the statutory presumption at the

48

time they applied for assistance."
Now, putting maladministration aside, describe
for us what the procedure is.
MRS. JUVILER:

At the time — from the initial

application?
QUESTION:

Yes.

Take an applicant who appears

for the first time and describe the procedure.

What

opportunity does he have?
MRS. JUVILER:

The applicant is interviewed and

it is the interview which is the primary and original
source of information.
He discusses his general situation and it comas
down to the situation that he is a Homs Relief applicant.
He is not a caretaker for eligible children.
aged, blind and disabled.

He is not

And they cay, well, how have

you been — this is specific, I am giving specific
reference to 351.8 — "How have

you been maintaining your­

self in the past?" and he said, "Well, a week ago I had a
job."
Let's talk about Joseph Beverly's specific
case because we do have a live case.
Joseph Beverly said, "Four days ago I quit ray
job working on a chicken farm and I have moved down here to
Geneva.”
And they say to him, "Well, why did you quit

4S
your job?"
And he says, "It wasn’t worth it

to me to

continue because rent is so expensive end I was evicted
because I just couldn't pay my rent, and therefore I left
my job."

That is the specific statement.
Now, they have been, and specifically in

Beverly's case, which is our live case, they called the
employer and, indeed, at the ultimate fair hearing which
was heard only two weeks after this initial interview, the
employer did testify and said,
to hire Joseph Beverly back.

"I continue.

I still want

He was a fine worker."

And the hearing officer determined —- as his
decision specifically states, that he did not believe that
Beverly quit his job because ha could not find housing.

He

believed he quit his job and made it a finding of fact, a:i
actual fact that he quit his job for the purpose of
obtaining public assistance.
But with regard to somebody who might overcome
the presumption, you might have a situation like this
where the person comes in and says, "I quit my job
because I am a legal stenographer and everyone told me that
legal stenographer’s jobs are available all over the place
and I had a specific position that I had in mind and now
two weeks later I find that that position is not available
and it isn't so easy to find a legal stenographer's job."

50

That statement itself, because of its internal
credibility, might be sufficient, whereas the statement that
Justice White posited earlier, "No, I didn't quit my job
for the purpose of obtaining public assistance" might not
be credible and sufficient to overcome the presumption.
QUESTION:

Do any regulations prescribe the

procedure at this hearing?
MRS. JUVILER:

Yea, there are two regulations,

assuming —
QUESTION:

If you just tell me what they are,

then I can check them out.
MRS. JUVILER:

Right,

as an appendix to our main brief.

the regulations appear
These are the regu­

lations which govern the application procedure and discuss
the duties of the local agency to investigate.

They

discuss the duties of the local agency to inform the
recipient of ineligibility and only to make the finding of—
QUESTION:

Are these the regulations that

commence at la of your brief?
MRS. JUVILER:

At la and let me particularly

draw your attention to page 5a.

This deals with the

conditions prior to a finding of ineligibility.
"Applications are denied and not accepted for
assistance when, in the course of the application interview
the information given by the applicant establishes without

51
the need for further investigation that he is ineligible.
"Ineligibility is determined in the course of or
upon completion of the investigation or if the applicant
refuses to comply with any requirements essential to the
determination of eligibility."
Furthermore, the finding that must be made
within 30 days, however, there are specific — I just
lost it — unless there are specific adjournment granted
to the applicant to produce additional information and
there is a specific duty at page 3a, 351.5 for the
applicant to produce the information.

And be informed

of his duty to produce it.
Specifically, at 351.2, appearing at pages 2a
and 3a, he must produce evidence of his resources.
And the basic duty is at page la, the
responsibility for furnishing information.
"Social Services officials shall provide
applicants and recipients end others who may inquire with
clear and detailed information concerning programs of
public assistance, eligibility requirements therefore,
methods of investigation and benefits available under such
programs."
QUESTION:

Are applicants given any pamphlet or

written information describing the procedure?
MRS. JUVILER:

Yes, your KQnor.

They do have

52
many different detailed pamphlets available —

I'll just ask you one other question.

briefs.

It is addressed

by both of you in the

If we should reach that point, is it your thought

that we should remand to the three-judge court or try
to decide it on this record?
MRS. JUVILERs

I believe that the Court can

decide the question of the validity of the opportunity to
rebut on the face of the statute, not only 131 A(li) but
the face of the regulations and the statute in effect.
However, the Court might prefer to remand it for
consideration in deference to the court below, which
specifically said it was not reaching the question.
The reason — after all, I framed the questions
and I will answer you in a more informal and direct way —
because of the footnotes in the

opinion below, I did not

feel that we could present this case to the Court'without
answering what we regarded as specific mdastatements about
the procedures available and it was not an unknowing
thought with which we framed that question and presented
it to the Court because we thought the footnotes in the
decision presented enough question as to the procedures.
The particular footnote I have reference to is
where the Court said, "There is no opportunity to rebut

53
before you get to the fair hearing/' and we think that is
decidedly not the case and could not leave that unanswered.
In fairness to our opponents, we couldr& just
stick it in as a footnote ourselves and we decided to put
it on its face.
QUESTION:

Wall, it has nothing to do with this

case, but we were talking about Mr. Beverly a little while
ago and the chicken farm.
MRS, JUVILER:

How much was ha making?
He was making — £2.25 an hour,

was it? *— I think 40 hours a week, he was guaranteed 40
hours a week and he was making $2.25.

Not much.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
