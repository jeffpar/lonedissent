ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. WARD, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. WARDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of tha

Court, and may it pleas© the Courts
marshal

to notify me.

I have requested the

I would lik® to save a little time

for rebuttal in view of the Solicitor General being permitted
to participate in the oral argument and brief along with one
additional amicus curiae.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

When the white signal

goes on, you will know that is the signal to save time for
rebuttal.
MR. WARD 3

Before getting to the discussion of the

issues, facts, and circumstances in this case, I think there
are two points that your Honors need to consider and Regp in
mind while you ar© considering the issues and the facts and
circumstances of this case.
One, East Carroll Parish is in northwest Louisiana,
a small rural parish.

In Louisiana our law requires the

district attorneys in our State to represent the local
governmental units in their districts, such as school boards
and police juries.

Oftentimes the district attorney will have

4
three parishes in his district which gives him three school
boards, three police juries to advise.

Of course*, he is

primarily a county prosecutor, criminal law.

Our district

attorneys axe generally understaffed and overworked, and
their assistants, the few that they have, are trained primarily
in criminal law.
We do not have for our school boards, unfortunately,
and our police juries a. baitary of lawyers such as the
Solicitor General and Justice Department have or the Lawyers
Committes for Civil Mights Under the Law, or even lawyers with
the expertise and knowledge in constitutional law that Mr.
Halpin has from the many cases h© has handled with the
American Civil Liberties Union.
I say that not to present

a Dcivid and Goliath

type picture, but merely so th® Court will understand that
back in 1971,

'68 to '71, when this case was in th® district

court, that school board and police jury were relying on the
advice of an assistant district attorney who really had not a
great deal of experience in this area of law,and also, the
second point, this particular area of the law was constantly
changing.

It was virtually Impossible, really, for lay polic®

jury members and lay school hoard members to know from day to
>

day what th© law really was with regard to reapportionment.
It was not until really your Avery decision that we knew that
it vrould apply to local political subdivisions as well as

5
congressional districts and State legislatures.
At that time, in '68, w© tried to anticipate th©
problem of reapportionment and assist these school boards,
as the briefs of all three., the respondent, the Solicitor
General, and amicus curiae,point out.

Th® Louisiana legislature

in 1968 adopted a law which would permit school boards to
reapportion themselves.-

That was Act 561.

A similar ~ not similar law, but to the same effect,
was suggested by the police juries, Act 445.
in

It is intimated

respondents5 brief, in th© Government’s brief that because

in prior years th© school board members and police jury
members had been elected from -the wards within a parish that
when th© legislature switched to a reapportionment plan which
would permit at-large districts, that there was seme invidious
motive in switching from single-member districts, if you could
call our police jury wards single-member districts, they really
were not, because some of them were multi-member,
switch them

but to

from that system to a possible permissive at-large

system was designed to discriminate against black citizens and
to deny them th© right to vote and th® right to participate
in the electoral 'process.
Nothing could be farther from -the truth.

For th©

School BoardsAssociation, Louisiana School Boards Association,
which is a nonprofit advisory service type organization which
I happen to represent, I drafted the legislation for the

6
school boards -that the legi.s lature adopted, Act 561.

It was

slightly amended in the legislature, but basically we were
lucky and it carae through pretty much as it went in.
We never considered once the possibility of that at-large
feature, permissive at-large feature,being used to discriminate
against black citizens or to dilute their vote.

We simply

wanted to give our school boards as much latitude as possible
in trying to devise the best plan that they could to help
them provide the best possible education system they could in
their parish.
The Attorney General of our State somewhat delayed
submitted those two Acts to the Attorney General of the
United Statos as required by the Voting Eights Act. He entered
an objection due to the afc-le.rg© feature.

We spent, myself

and Mr. James Prescott, who is Executive Secretary of the
Louisiana School Boards Association, about two years with
numerous phone calls and correspondence trying to convince
the Attorney General that since the at»large feature was
permissive and sine© the Voting Rights Act would require
submission of local governmental units r©apportionment plans
to him, there was no need for him to object to th© State
legislation.

And not only that, but because of his objection,

we now find that some school boards — I say them particularly
because I represent them more than I do police juries — could
not reapportion because of th® inoperativeness of th© Stata

7
legislation.
QUESTIONS

It was authorising legislation? was it

not? both Acts-'were authorizing legislation,.
MR. WARD:

Yes.

That's correct? your Honor.

QUESTION?

Authorizing school boards to do this if

they wanted to.
MR. WARD?
at-large districts.
QUESTION;

That's correct.

It did not mandate

It made it permissive.
And that was true of both Acts? for the

school board and for the police jury.
MR. WARD;
much shorter.

That's correct.

The police jury Act was

It simply repealed a lot of the statutes tying

police juries to wards.

Whereas? our Act went into more

detail? limited the smallness and the maximum size of the
board within their discretion, permitted single-member districts
or at-large districts.
Ey the way, one reason for that was that school
boards had been tied to police juries historically.

Simply,

we elect the same school board members and the same wards
elect police juries.

And the school boards have wanted to get

away from that for many years.
QUESTION %

Mr. Ward, tell me about a police jury.

Doss it have the same authority generally as a county board
of supervisors?
MR. WARD:

Generally speaking? Mr. Justice Powell?

8
I would say yes.

Building roads and drainage ditches and that

kind of thing.
QUESTION:

Does it have the power to levy taxes?

MR. WARD; Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

It’s the only governing body in the

MR. WARD:

It is the only governing body in the

parish?

parish except for the school board which has complete and
sole jurisdiction over the school system for the parish and
any town council which may be in a town or a village.

It is

the sole governing authority for the parish government.
But school board functions and police jury functions
are so totally different that we had long wanted to get away
from being tied to the police jury.

There is no reason why

school board members should be elected from the same districts
that police jury members are.

We have parish-wide school

systems, and it’s not important whether this man gets a school
built in his district as compared to this man over here.
It's do you get fcb© right kind of school built throughout the
parish to provide the best education.
We ultimately were successful in getting the
Attorney General, convincing him that he could withdraw his
objection to the permissive legislation, which he did in ’72
after this case had been through the district court.

Now, when it was before the district court originally

9

it was on a suit on the 14th amendment grounds of one man one
vote in 8 68 .

Of course f an, at-large system meets one man on®

vote requirements perfectly with zero deviation.
When 1970 rolled around, as a matter of fact that
plan was approved by the district court.
taken.

There was no appeal

And really it's- sort of res judicata.
QUESTION:

That was an at-large plan, but was

residential requirements?
MR. WARD:

That's correct.

The same residence

requirements, meaning their wards.
In 1970, however, the district court on its own
motion requested the board and police jury to either file a
new plan or at least to file updated statistics based on the
1970 Census which -QUESTION:

Who requested that?

MR. WARD:

The district judge.

QUESTION:

Who had retained jurisdiction.

MR. WARD:

No, sir, not specifically.

I do not

believe the appendix indicates that he retained jurisdiction
from his — he may have.
QUESTION:

You're correct.

He must have or there® would have had to

be a new lawsuit.
MR. WARD:
update.

That's correct.

It required them to

They did simply by filing the same plan, the '70 Census

figures did not affect the one man one vote because it was an

10

at-large system.
QUESTION;

So did he enter a new order?

MR. WARD:

At that point the present intervener

respondent intervened, Mr. Marshall, and complaining of 15th
amendment discrimination in .dilution of the black vote.

The

district court held a hearing in July of 1971 in which the
plaintiffs, the intervener hero, Marshall, brought evidence
to the effect that you had a history of segregated school system
in East Carroll Parish, that Federal registrars had to coma in
and register black voters, the usual thing of that hopefully
obsolete history of our past as to practices which we nowregret „
However, in this particular parish at that time even
black citizens constitute about 58 percent of the total
population in the parish.

At that time they were 45 percent

approximately of the registered voters in the parish.

I

don't know what the eligible voting age figures would be.

I

do not have those. The district court concluded and in his order
of August 971

set down seven points, four of which, as I

recall, related directly to whether or not this plan
discriminated against the black citizens of East Carroll
Parish.

He found that it did not, that they were a majority

in population, that the plan was equitable, one man one vote
since it. was at large, and he approved of that plan.
The intervener noticed an appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

11
The panel decision affirmed the district court two to one.
An application for rehearing was filed and granted by the
Fifth Circuit* and they reheard the case en banc ("en banc”
as w® say in Louisiana) and by a 9 to 6 split decision reversed
the district court finding that due to the fact that black
citisens in East Carroll Parish were at that time only 45
percent of the registered voters, regardless of the question
of how many were eligible to register, of age to register,
that that was sufficient to dilute the minority vote, even
though the blacks were in a -QUESTIONs

So it was a constitutional holding.

MR. WARD:

Constitutional, yes, sir.

That was a

constitutional holding based primarily on white versus
registered.

There were six dissents, six dissenting opinions

to the effect that population is the proper criteria and not
registered voters and that because of population majority,
there was no way that an at-large plan could discriminat©
against teat majority.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, what was the judge's answer to

contentions in the district court that, without even getting
the constitutional issues, the preference is for single-member
districts when a court is fashioning a reapportionment plan?
MR. WARD:
your Honor.

I may partially have to bag ignorance,

I did not represent the petitioner either at the

district court or the Court of Appeals.

12
QUESTION:

This Court has said that is the normal

rule# isn't it?
MR. WARD:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Although multi-member districts aren't

per se unconstitutional# if a court has to com® up with a
plan or appro\Te a plan that tha preference is for single-member
districts.
MR. WARD:

Well# I think you did say in Conner v»

Johnson that when a court fashions a plan -- it may not have
been Conner v. Johns or; — that it should prefer single-member
districts, although I do not yet understand the preference.
QUESTION:

Well# you may not b© able to understand it.

What I asked you was what was -the district court3 s answer to
that?
MR. WARD:

His answer to that was# if the issue was

raised at the district court level, that regardless of that
preference# unless there was proof that the other plan was
unconstitutional# there was no need for him to draw a singlemember district plan.

He did not actually draw this plan.

QUESTION: ’ I know# but it was put into effect by a
court order.
MR. WARD:

That's correct# yes# sir.

QUESTION:

It was not. a piece of legislation.

MR. WARD:

Yes — well#—that's the contention in -this

suit now by’the Solicitor General.

13

QUESTION;

Well, it was not a piece of legislation?

it was a court-ordered plan.
MR. WARD;

The court ordered the policy jury and the

school board to adopt
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. WARD;

And submit to it a plan, which they did.

QUESTION;

Which they did, which is normal in the

apportionment cases.

You get fch© board to submit plans.

That’s where they usually com® from.
MR. WARD:

That’s right.

And he accepted their plan

as being constitutional.
QUESTION:

The school board and the police jury had

legislative authority to do it, did they not?
MR. WARDs

There would be a ■—

QUESTION;

Under the authorising acts of the State

legislature.
MR. WARD:

If you go purely technically, at the

time this case was decided in the district court, the Attorney
General's objection to the permissive legislation was still in
effect and was not withdrawn until '72, so those State statutes
were not in effect.
QUESTION:

And they had no legislative authority.

They could certainly comply' with the court's request to submit
a plan, but they couldn’t legislate without the statutory
authority.

14
MR. WARD:

That would be correct.

That is correct,

your Honor.
QUESTIONS

I see.

MR. WARD t

And the court approved the plan as being

constitutional over the objections that it discriminated.
Now, of course single-member districts and multimember districts, you can draw reapportioranent plans like a
pie, you can put it into all sorts of different kinds of
slices, depending on who has got the knife.
QUESTION:

Was it urged in the Court of Appeals

single-member districts should have been put in because of the
for
preference expressed by this Court /single-member districts
in court-ordered plans?
MR. WARD:

It was raised, your Honor.

There was not

a great deal, however, made of it that I can find either at
the district court level or at either Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

While the case was pending in the Court of

Appeals did the district court try to change its order?,
MR. WARDs

Yes, your Honor, it did.

QUESTIONs

And didn * 1 it put in single-member

districts while the case was pending in the Court of Appeals?
MR. WARD;

That9s correct, your Honor,

QUESTIONS

What did the Court of Appeals say about

MR. WARD :

Once the case was on appeal, the district

that?

15
court no longer had jurisdiction without a new order.
QUESTIONs
the Court of Appeals.
MR. WARD:

That was the panel decision, though, of
I didn't see that repeated in the en banc.
In the en banc, as I recall, if they

mentioned it. at all, it was barely in passing because they had
decided apparently that they were going to reverse the at-large
plan.

So there was no need for them to particularly consider

that question.
QUESTION:

There wasn't any need for them to even

have an en banc hearing if the district court was already
ready to put in a single-member district plan.
MR. WARD:

But does the district court have

jurisdiction to issue orders once a case is on appeal?

Or

can he cut out the chance to hear the issue on appeal when
it has already been appealed?

Another thing, this was an

ex parte order issued without hearing, without notice to the
defendant political subdivision at all.
QUESTION:

Anyway, as the case comes to us, we>are

talking about the validity of the district court order that
the district judge wants to scrap and has tried to scrap.
MR. WARD:

I would respectfully submit that under

all the rules —
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that true?

That is the fact.

I agree with you that the Court of Appeals said to you that
the district judge had no authority.

16
HR. WARD;

Apparently somebody convinced him without

a hearing or anything that perhaps the state of decisions that hac
come down since his original order commanded single-member
districts.

If that is the law, it certainly should not be

the law because single-member districts can be just as
discriminatory as at-large and multi-member districts.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record, Mr. Ward,

that indicetes one way or the other whether the district court3s
second order was entered with or without a hearing?
MR. WARD;

You will not find a new motion

record after the original complaint was filed.

in the

In his brief

he attaches the order of the court, but he does not attach
any new motion nor is there any in the record that I was able
to find or any notice of a hearing to be set.

And according

to the .information given me by the then assistant district
attorney who was handling it, nobody knew about it until it
was issued.

QUESTION:

Usually if there is a hearing, it recites

the fact of a hearing, does it not?

Is that Louisiana practice?

MR. WARD:

All it says -- I will read the beginning.

QUESTION:

Where are you reading from?

17
MR. WARD;

I'm reading from respondent's brief,

page laa, the appendix.
The order itself, this is the order of '72, March 27,
1972, commences by saying, "On August 7, 1971, this Court
entered an order approving at-large parish-wide elections for
the Police. Jury and School Board of East Carroll Parish.
Subsequent decisions, particularly the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, have convinced this Court that
at-large elections for a parish with sizable black population
and a history of denial of the vote to black citizens, is
constitutionally impermissible and is without valid Louisiana
statutory authority.

Having received the various alternative

plans proposed by plaintiff-intervenor and defendants at the
July 2S, 1971, hearing, the Court finds that the nine-member
... plan" is the best.

No indication at all of any further

motion by the intervenor or any notice to the defendant public
bodies or chance to defend against that viewpoint, which we
submit is incorrect, bath procedurally a;id as a matter of law.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ward, while we are talking about tie

procedural problems, you mention in your brief, at least if
I read it correctly, that there has been a change in the
relative strength of the black versus white voting population.
Is that in the record?

What's the support for that in your

brief?
MR. WARD:

My authority for that

change in registered

18
voters comes from a letter from the Registrar of Voters, as I
requested .him to let me know what was his registration now.
Those figures are accurate, they are not in the record.
record would have to be supplemented.

The

And I inquired of the

clerk after filing my petition if it would be proper to do so
and he indicated that at the time he did not.

Mr. Halpin and

1 discussed that factor.
These are one of those cases that can't be decided
on the basis of just old stated fact's in 1971 like maybe an
automobile accident can be decided.
QUESTION:

The law changes and —

Do you think it would be appropriate for

the whole case to go back to the district court and start over?
Is that what you are really saying?
MR. WARD:
should.

No, sir.

I'm saying I don't think you

I think you should decide this case on -the merits

even if the Government's position as to section 5 of the
Voting Rights Act is correct and should be applied in other
cases.

There would be no real point in sending this case as it

stands before you now back to the district court and put these
two bodies to all of the expense of going to the Attorney
General under section 5, then possibly having to go to the
district court of the District of Columbia to get a ruling
if the Attorney General's ruling is adverse.

I think the

Attorney General may also need some direction from this Court
as to is an at-large system under these kind of circumstances

19

constitutionally impermissible.

Presumably if you do not,

he may in his consideration, if it went back to the district
court and through the Attorney General, under section 5, say
it's constitutionally impermissible and here w® come right back
to this Court again, because it just doesn’t seem conceivable
to me that. —
QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, which are the circumstances

we should base that decision on?

An assumption that th® blacks

outnumber the whites or the whites outnumber this blacks in
the voting arena?
MR. WARD:

Th© respondent here, the complaint —

QUESTION:

What is th© factual basis on which you

want us to make that decision?

If it's cn the basis of the

record, it might be one decision; if it's on th® basis of what
you tell us in the brief, it might, be something els®.
MR. WARD:

I think on the basis that I think ~ f there

is a problem of doing it on the basis of'the record, the Court
should permit the record to be updated with regard to the
present facts as to the —
QUESTION:

You think the updating should be done in

this Court rather than in the district court.
MR. WARD:
your Honor.

In the. essence of time, I would say yes,

If it must go back to the district court for that,

then let it go back for that limited purpose.

But even the

district court is going to need some direction from this Court

20

as to if the facts are this, what is the law? or if the facts
are this, what is the law?

Are there now more registered

black voters in East Carroll Parish than white?
population still 58 percent black?
at-large plan constitutional?

And is the

And if it is, then is this

I think the district court will

need to know, because I don't believe he knows now whether it
is or whether it is not.
QUESTION:

We don't either.

MR. WARD:

But you have to make the decision as to

QUESTION:

But how can w® if we don't know?

MR. WARD:

As to those facts, if you want to send it

whether -—

back to the district court or permit us to supplement the
record with the exact facts, that may be the proper thing to do
It's a long time and a lot of expense for these two local
government units who don't have a great deal of money.

Local

governments aren't very rich, particularly in small rural
parishes.
I would like to perhaps conclude by saying I don't
necessarily disagree with the Government's position as to the
use of section 5,and the plans should be submitted.

The lav/

of section 5 has changed so much since the Voting Rights Act
v;as first adopted.

In 1965 the only newspaper publicity was

about requiring them to read the Constitution and that sort of
thing.

It wasn't really until about 1969 or '70 that we began

21
to realize,that is, in the local government area, that this
section 5 is back there that everything we do must be submitted
to the Attorney General.

We relocate a polling place,in

somebody's grocery store, and he says,

"I'm tired of putting

up with this, go find yourself another polling place."
that and it must be submitted.

We do

It's a problem.

But I have submitted plans to the Justice Department
under section 5 and have had them approved, all single-member
districts, all multi-member districts, and combinations, and that
does not bother me.

Having to come all the way to Washington,

D„C. and bring witnesses in order to try to defend myself in
the D.C. district court,
Congress did it.

that's another problem.

Of course,

I don't know that you could dc much about it,

unless it is discriminatory against a State for depriving them
of the normal judicial procedure of their local district
judges.

There seems to be some indication that perhaps

Congress did not trust our local district judges.
Mr. Halpin wins

I find them •—

as many cases on one side as I do on the

other, so I would say they do a pretty good job.
But perhaps that is a way to take a burden off the
court system by requiring it to go to section 5 in other
cases, even though suit has been filed.

And our problem back

in '71, particularly with Conner v..Johnson, we did not know
how7 far Conner v. Johnson went, and suite; were being filed
and the district attorneys relied on their district judges and

22
their district judges — this is not the only one -- inter­
preted Conner v. Johnson to apply even whan he did not devise
the plan himself but had compelled the plan through a court
order directing the legislative body to submit a plan to him.
I think you can decide the merits of this case, under
these circumstances, on the merits and hold this at-large
plan as being constitutionally permissible under these
circumstances and make an alternative decision as to other
cases and the section 5 position of the Government.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Ward.

Mr. Halpin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. HALPIN, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HALPIN:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

There are certain factual matters that I feel

compelled to correct at the outset.

The matter of the question

of the percentage of black voter registration in the parish
has arisen on a question from Mr. Justice Stevens, and the
petitioners in their brief assert that as of the particular time
in which they refer to in their brief that there was a '
majority of black voters, and their figuras I think show that
there were 17 more black voters than white voters.
However, I checked this, and my information is that
there was only a short period of time of approximately three

23
weeks during the summer of '75 in which this was the case due
to a. flux in adoption of the new Louisiana Constitution which
enfranchised a new segment of people# anc] blacks in the parish#
as they always do there# worked hard and got sort of a jump
on the registration for a few weeks .

But, then the registration

went back to its normal level so that the; figures that I had
someone obtain from the Registrar of Voters in East Carroll
Parish yesterday are as follows# that there are 3,511 blacks
registered and 3,759 whites registered, or a white majority of
248 voters.
QUESTION:

I think# Mr. Halpin, what you are telling

us that for is that we are not in any position to get into
resolving the contest over the facts here.
MR. IIALPIN:
QUESTION:

Precisely.
Unless at some point you would both agree

on facts which could b© judicially noticed.
MR. HALPIN:

Precisely# your Honor.

Th®te are facts#—

®hi3 is just one of them# but there are also inferences to be
drawn as to these facts.

There have also been elections that

have been run in five years since the trial of this case.

These

are matters of serious contests#and I frankly cannot, see how
we can — we cannot resolve the case on facts as they exist.
QUESTION:

Along -that same line# can you shed any

light on whether or not there was notice and hearing in
connection with Judge Dawkins’ order of —

Yes, sir, that's what I was going to

I don't have my complete file with me.

My recollec­

tion is that 1 filed a motion to modify the injunction which
then resulted in the court order.

I'm not absolutely positive,

and I will be glad to communicate by letter and attach if that
was the case.

Certainly, the situation was that th® petitioners

had certainly every right to move th® court to reconsider or
rehear had they objected to th® second order.
question the second order was done
QUESTION:

very rapidly and —•

While this was on appeal?

MR. HALPIN:
QUESTIONs

There is no

After appeal had teen noticed, yas, sir.
What's your position on whether th©

district court -— I take it you felt th® district court had
jurisdiction to do it.
MR. HALPIN:

In respect to that, I think if we are

dealing with an injunctive matter, particularly in sections
where you have a great deal of flux, that, certainly the district
court has the right to modify an injunction, you know, to meet
present circumstances and change in th® law, whatever, and that
particularly in this case there are procedures which we
indicated in a footnote in our brief that at least eight of
the circuits agree that in situations as this, where the
district judge is changing his mind, th® proper procedure is
for the district judge to indicate his difference and then for
the Court of Appeals to remand to give him an opportunity to

25

do this.
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN;

Mr. Halpin, did you serve the other side?
If I filed a motion, I did serve it on

the other side, your Honor.
QUESTIONs

Well, I heard him say he didn't know about

it until after he came down.
MR. HALPIN:

Well, Mr. Ward wasn't counsel then, so

I think he was saying he doesn't know.

But I will be glad to

supply the Court with whatever was filed or indicate in a
letter that no motion was filed.

But my recollection, although

that v/as five years ago, my recollection is that I did file
something, and my practice as an attorney is always if I file
a motion to serve it on opposing counsel.
QUESTION:

I take it the Court of Appeals had before

it the district judge's second order.
MR. HALPIN:
QUESTION:

Yes,
And decided that they either could, not or

would not consider it because in their view he had no
jurisdiction.
MR. HALPIN:
this

They deemed it is out of jursdiction
And I think the proper procedure at

that stage? would have been to remand the case so that

with instructions.
QUESTION:

What was th® district judge's answer to the

Connor v. Johnson claim that single-member districts were to be

26

preferred when th® court adopted a plan?
MR. HALPIN:

Frankly, itss not absolutely ciear.

I

have to guess, of course, to a certain extent as to what the
judge is saying.

I raised that

orally before this, and

it does appear in the appendix.
QUESTION:

You raised th© same thing in th@ Court of

Appeals
MR. HALPIN; Yes, sir.
QUESTION?

— and th® Court of Appeals put it on a

constitutional basis.
MR. HALPIN;

Yes, sir, and I can only assuraa that

what was going on with th® district judge is that somehow he
didn’t consider himself in th® situation of drawing a remedy
or that somehow that case -- I really don't know, your Honor.

Then it should

And if not, it’s under Conner v.

Johnson and Chapman v. Meier.

But exactly what his thinking

was at that time, I can't really tell the Court.

You are urging that the case is what?

MR. HALPIN;

Is moot, your Honor, in view of the

How does the second order get here?

Is it

MR. EALPIN:

It’s in th© record in the Court of Appeals?

MR. HALPIN;

Well, notice of appeal was filed by

the other side to the second order, and I assume it was -then
lodged.
QUESTION;
MR. HALPIN:

..

moot, this case is not older.

Well, your Honor, I would raise a

technicality, though, that I would think that it would be in
the sense that the district court has definitely indicated its
view to change its mind.
QUESTION:

I know, but wouldn't you be satisfied if

28
this case went back before the district court on a Conner v.
Johnson that you should have given preference to single-member
districts and didn't?
MR. HALF IN %

Welly that's not ray first, preference ,

but —
QUESTIONS

I know, but wouldn't, that accomplish

everything?
MR. HALPIN:

That would accomplish in some respects.

I don't think that's the best —

Yes, that would accomplish

our purpose, and that would be 'treating it as a Chapman v. Meier
situation, but. the reason that I'm concerned, about that, now,
is that I think this is a section 5 situation.

We have got

not only this case to deal with, but we have got many other
cases to deal with, and I'm familiar with, those particularly in
Louisiana where these court decrees have been used to circum­
vent section 5.

We lodged in the record for the Court's benefit

what I find the worst example of this, but the classic example
of circumvention, a case named Whatley v. Union Parish.

It's

a very short record, everything was filed on the same day.
It's about 10 days.

The complaint was filed on the same day,

the answer was filed on the same day, an order was filed and
signed on the same day by the court approving a plan for the
redistricting of Union Parish in Louisiana, a place with, a
significant black population which the Justice Department had
only months before objected to under section 5 as a violation.

29

And th© thing is I think fc'h© way to handle this case
would be to make a clear pronouncement that this is clearly
covered, for instance, by Connor v. Waller that this sort of
circumvention should not continue.

We cite in footnote 32 of

our brief, which I believe is at page —
QUESTION:

Waller, disposition last/— what was

Connor v. Waller?
MR. It ALP IN:

Connor v. Waller, your Honor, was a

Mississippi situation.
QUESTION;

That’s the one we handled summarily last

June or so, isn’t it?
MR. HALPINs

Yes, sir. Specifically the Court

indicated there that the district court in holding that —
the Mississippi State legislature had adopted a court (sic)
very similar to that which the three»judge district court had
adopted and then the district court said this is not subject to
section 5.

This Court said it was subject to section 5 and

said the court shouldn't have considered those different racial
allegations.
But at footnote 32 of our brief, on page 18, we
cite a number of cases, I think there are about 10 or 12, all
in that same district in Louisiana in which the courts have
approved

redistricting planswithout them aver having been

submitted under section 5.
QUESTION;

Yes, but, Connor v. Waller involved

30
whatever was submitted to the district court in that case was
a product of legislative action.
MR. HALPIM:

Yes, sir.

jury adopted a resolution.
saying,

It was a piece of legislation.
Here, your Honor, the police

They sent a letter to the court

"We have adopted this; please incorporate it in your

forthcoming order."
QUESTIONS

In Connor v. Waller you had two separate

Acts, one of the Upper House and one of the Lower House which
added up to the legislative' plan.
MR. HALPIMs

Is that it?

I’m not terribly familiar with it, but

it could be, your Honor.
QUESTION:

That’s my recollection of it and there

wasn't any question that that was a legislative plan, and yet
the court for some reason held it was not covered by section 5.
We summarily reversed and said, yes, a legislated change like
that was indeed a section 5.

MR. HALPIN:
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN:

Right.
Is that the situation here?
Just about, your Honor.

I think so.

In Connor you had this ongoing radistricting litigation.

This

redistricting done was in the context of litigation just as much
as it was here.
QUESTION:

You colleague says that when this plan was

adopted, it had no legislative power to adopt this.
just responding to a request of the court.

It was

31

MR. HALPIN:

Well, it’s not clear what they say.

At

one point in their brief, at page 6, I think they admit quite
the opposite.

They say that this wasn’t a court-fashioned

plan, this was something the police jury had been working on
even before.

They said it’s something that was adopted

by

the jury.
QUESTION %

Well, that may be true, but I think his

point was that under the State authorizing statute, it was not
in force.
MR. HALPIN;

That’s correct.

So that technically —

however, there are lots of bodies, police juries and school
boards, which continue to do that, to enact it without that
authorization.

And incidentally, again, a point of factual

correction, the objection to 561 dealing v/ith school boards has
been lifted, but the objection, tc 4-15 dealing with police
juries has never been removed by the Justice Department, and that
was a misstatement of fact.
QUESTION;

In other words, police juries continue to

be without legislative power to reapportion themselves, is that
right, because it’s being held up by the Justice Department.
MR. HALPIN:
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN;

To go at-large.
Pardon?
To go at-large.

They can redistrict

themselves as long as they do it to single-member districts.
They can't go at-large using that new statute under current lav;.

32

QUESTION?

They do not themselves have legislative

power to do that.
MR. II ALP IN:
QUESTION:

Right.
Because th© authorising statute has been

suspended while it’s pending approval under section 5 by the
Justice Department, is that it?
MR. HALEIN:

Yes, sir.

Well, it's been objected to.

QUESTION:

Well, I say —

QUESTION:

It's not a Connor v. Waller case by

definition.
QUESTION;
MR. HALFIN:
QUESTION:

It is not by definition, it couldn't be.
Well, as a practical —
I don’t mean as a practical matter, but as

a legal matter it is not, is it?
MR. HALPIN:
Honor,

I think it’s indistinguishable, your

I think it is a situation where you do have an adoption,

although in the sens® that they don’t have authority to adopt
it, it’s not an adoption.
QUESTION:

Suppose a police jury is named a defendant

in a district court action and defends, and they hire an.
attorney and there is the — I don’t know whether you have a
chairman or a president of a police jury -- in a committee that
supervises this suit.

And the attorney and the chairman of

th© police jury get together, the court has asked them for a
plan, and th© chairman and the attorney get together and say, We

33
will submit this plan.

Surely that’s not a Connor v. Waller

situation,, is it?
MR. HALPIN:

1 think it is, your Honor.

I think the

test is who drafted the plan.
QUESTION:

I thought certainly what Connor v. Waller

talks about is was this a legislative enactment.
MR.' HALPIN:

I think that distinction is oversub tie

and doesn't really meet the needs of interpretation at all.
QUESTION:

That may be your view of the law,

what

the law should be, but certainly Connor v. Waller spoke in
terms of the legislative enactment.
MR. HALPIN:

Yes,sir, but I think if you read

Connor v. Waller with Conner v. Johnson wherein in Conner v.
Johnson you had a situation where the court was drawing its own
plan as an interim measure, and this Court said OK, that's beyond
the reach of section 5, that's the exact tracks and narrow
holding there.
QUESTION:
plan.

Well, you say the court drawing its own

You've practiced enough, and X think I practiced before

I went on the bench, to know that there are very, very few
judges who sit down without any advice from counsel on either
side and ponder the whole thing through and com® up with
something that was never suggested, to them by a lawyer.

Don't

you agree?
MR. HALPIN:

Well, yes, sir. Frequently they are now

34
appointing special masters who do draft the plans.
QUESTION:

In the absence of a special master, I

don't mean just in a case like this, but in any case, the judge
gets at least his idea if not the findings that he actually
signs,.from one of the parties.
MR. HALPIN:

Well, of course, it's always an adversary

situation, yes, sir.
I think the technical line when you read Conner v
Johnson _ together with Connor v. Waller , that the rule comes
out that you do have to attempt to make this determination as
to whether this is a creature of the court or a creature of
the legislature.

And to not-do that —

QUESTION s

What you are really suggesting is that

the district judge when he calls for somebody to submit, some
plans,he's got to wait until you dispose of this case,until one
of the parties has his wrestling match with the Attorney General.

OK.

This where . way I think it —

Either that or he has to receive the plan

and then himself ask the Attorney General.

QUESTION:

A court-ordered plan as contrasted from a

legislative plan that was adopted by a legislative body, State
and/or local.
MR. HALPIN:

Yes.

My concern also — certainly,

Chapman v. Meier and Conner v. Johnson would require singlemember districts, but I wanted this opportunity to point out to
the Court some of the very difficult practical problems that we

35
are dealing with in Louisiana and other placas, and that there
should be some mechanism to avoid the circumvention of section 5
through court orders»

And that mechanism would be, such as we

have suggested in the brief, either to draw this thing to meet QUESTION:

MR. HALFIN:

I think the principal difference -Because they will not permit multi-member

districts under section 5 if there is any kind of identifiable
residential pattern of living in the community, isn’t that right?
MR. HALFINs

I think as a practical matter the

difference is where the burden of proof lies. ..To. the extent
to which tliat is a factor in fch® case, it would make a
difference in the standard.

But when you are dealing with

at-large elections, it seems that the substantive standard is
not —

that the Attorney General has approved under section 5?
MR. HALPIN;
QUESTION;

No, sir,
You aren't about to find on© either, are

you?
MR. HALPIN:

No, sir.

What I would urge the Court is that if, as the Court
has suggested, this is a creature of the court or a courtordered plan, which wouldn't be under section 5, that clearly
Conner v„ Johnson and Chapman v. Meier

would require 'that

38
single-member districts be devised as a remedy.
QUESTION?

Mr. Halpin, I’ve got Connor v. Waller

now, and indeed what we held there was that the district court
©rrad in holding that House Bill No. 1290 and Senate Bill No.
2976, Mississippi Laws 1975 Regular Session, are not legislative
enactments required to be submitted pursuant to jsection 5 of
the Voting Rights Act.

There wasn’t any question there that

we had statutes of Ch® Stats legislature in Mississippi.
ME. HALFIN:
QUESTION;

Gh, yes, sir.
That were held not to be legislative

enactments, and we said that was just plain wrong and they
should be required to go under section 5.

here is not quite that.

Hare we have a resolution of the school

board of November 18, 1968, or whatever it is, and the question

MR. HALPIN:
Certainly,

That’s true^ your Honor.
in any ©vent, it's quit© clear that there

are a number of things that have happened since this case was
tried some five years ago, and I think it certainly is
appropriate that it be considered on th© present facts, and
this Court is in no position to do that.
x would think that it should be under section 5 of the

3?
Voting Rights Act# in particular# that since now the school
board does have, one body does have# the authority to be able
to go at-large.

Maybe that’s th® result that we will have to

reach ultimately and that some of these questions may pe
metaphysical, because when it comes back to this Court# the
Court will be in the situation this board now has the authority
to do it and it may well he an enactment then under Connor v.

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1 p.m.)
M.R„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Landsberg, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN K. LANDSBERG AS
AMICUS CURIAE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LANDSBERG;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act provides in

relevant part that whenever a State — and it's set forth on.
page 2 of the Government's brief ~ that whenever a State or
political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions
sat forth in section 4(a) ar® in effect shall enact or seek to
administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting
or standard practice or procedure with respect to voting
different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964then
that State or political subdivision must comply- with the
preclearance provisions of section 5 either by bringing a suit
in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking
approval of th© change as not having a discriminatory purpose
or effect or by submitting th® change to the Attorney General.
If it's submitted to feh© Attorney General and the
Attorney General has not interposed an objection within 60
days , then the State or political subdivision may enforce th©
ehang©.
Now, th© question today, I suppose, is whether the

41
words "seek to administer" which are found in the first —■
QUESTION:

Is this question among fch© questions on

which certiorari was granted?
MR. LANDSBERG:
QUESTION:

No.

What do you suggest we do about that?

MR. LANDSBERG:

Your Honor, I think it's a question

of judicial administration which, if we are correct in our
position that the courts below should not have considered the
plan submitted to them prior to preclearance, then w© think
that ~—
QUESTIONs

You think it's like a jurisdictional

question.
MR. LANDSBERG:

It's in the nature of not subject

matter jurisdiction, but of primary jurisdiction, as we suggest
in our brief.
QUESTION:

Ordinarily, though, we don’t let even one

of the parties argue an, issue that was not raised in the
questions presented under certiorari.

You8re amicus, and you

are seeking to alter it.
MR. LANDSBERG:

Your Honor, this Court has on its

own raised questions where it felt that principles of judicial
administration required the Court to do so.
QUESTION:

There's a difference between arguing it

and an amicus doing it, of course.
MR. LANDSBERG:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice

42
As art amicus, we are I suppos® suggesting that this Court should
do it* and it is an issue which has been briefedf it's an
issue which has been addressed in oral argument. This Court has
the authority to decide it.

It is also an alternative ground

for affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals sending th©
case back to the district court.
QUESTION:

But also the question you want to raise

seems to run against "th® grain of our prior cases.
MR. LANDSBERG:

Well, I think that3s the question

that I would like to discuss, because I don’t believe that it
does.
There are two cases.

Neither case is an interpretation

of th© words 13seek to administer."
Johnson

The first case, Conner v.

held that a decree of a district court was not subject

to review by the Attorney General.

In that case the district

court had formulated its own plan because the jurisdiction
involved had failed to present an acceptable plan that met
14th amendment standards.

So fcha Court properly held that

under section 5 the court-ordered plan was not, a plan which had
been enacted by the jurisdiction, and it was not. a plan which
the jurisdiction sought to administer.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the fact remains that once the

plan was issued by the district court, the locality administered
it.
MR. LANDSBERG:

It was required to.

43

QUESTION; Well’, it administered it, didn't it?
MR. LANDSBERG:

It did administer it.

It was under

order to administer it.
QUESTION;

Nevertheless, it could administer the plan

without going to the Attorney General.
MR. LANDSBERG;

That's whet this Court held.

And we

have no
QUESTION:

I'm not sure you agree with that.

MR. LANDSBERG;

Mo, we have no quarrel with that.

And Congress in reenacting the Voting Rights Act i.n
1975 cited the Court's decision in Conner v. Johnson with
approval as expressing the will of Congress,
Congress also was of the view, and the legislative
history is set forth on pages 18 to 20 of our brief, that
section 5 would apply to situations such as this.

This is not

a case where it was necessary for a decision of a district court
to be submitted to the Attorney General.

The proper course for

the district court her© would have been to defer ruling on the
case until the jurisdiction had complied witht he provisions of
section 5.

We think that's what this Court said 'that, the

State of Mississippi should have done in Connor v. Waller.
Now, the difference between this case and Connor v.
Waller is that in Connor v. Falter there was an enactment; her©
it is arguable at least with respect to the police jury that
there was not an enactment because of the invalidity of the

44
State law providing

— the enabling statute allowing at,-large

elections.
QUESTION;

What if the district court h©r®, Mr.

Landsberg, had done just what it did, but there had been no
appeal taken from its judgment and it became final, would you
still say that there was a litigabi© violation of section 5?
MR. LANDSBERG;

It has been held that there is by

the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
QUESTION;

In this circuit here?

MR. LANDSBERG;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Even though the district court judgment

is final?
MR. LANDSBERG;

Yes.

And we would prefer to avoid

that situation where the Attorney General is called upon or
required to review a statute which a district court has already
approved.

We think that the procedure that we are suggesting

would avoid that result.
The differences between Connor v« Waller
case ar© perhaps twofold.

and this

In Connor v. Waller there was not a

court order to submit the change to the court.

The court,

however, under established practices in reapportionment cases
generally,gave the legislature an opportunity to enact a new
reapportionment plan.
QUESTION;

What would you say the rule should be

under section 5 if the court enters a declaratory judgment that

45
a reapportionment plan in existence is unconstitutional and
requests the parties, both sides, to submit plans, and suppose
the Attorney General of the State is then in court defending
the State plan, and he goes back and confers with his legislative
colleagues and he comes back to the court; with a plan and
submits it as the State’s official suggestion to the court for
a plan, and the other party, of course, comes back with a plan,
too.
Now, the court has requested the State to make its
official recommendation to the court.
Does Conner v. Johnson

What’s your rule there?

apply or Waller?

MR. LANDS BERG:

Waller.

St would, be a plan which

the jurisdiction is seeking the court’s approval and it’s
thereby seeking to administer.

I don't think that this is the

ordinary way in which a r©apportionment case would be handled.
Ordinarily the court would
QUESTION:

What did you say?

MR. LANDSBERG:

I think that ordinarily the court

would first ask or give the opportunity for the State or
political subdivision to formulates a plan.
QUESTION:

Not when the legislature isn't about to.

meet before the next election.
.MR. LANDSBERG:

Well, if we are in an emergency

type situation, that’s true.
QUESTION:

That’s half the time.
t

46

MR. LANDSBERGs

That’s true.

In Connor v. Waller

there was an emergency type situation.
QUESTION:

I know, but in the situation Mr. Justice

White posed, the Attorney General has been party to the
litigation, and the litigation has resulted in invalidation of
the existing legislative reappor&ionment plan, and the request
is mad® to the parties to submit a plan, and the Attorney
General says, wall, if you are going to have a plan, try this
on®, not something the legislature adopts, but something that
he formulates, and he submits the plan, end that plan is then
adopted by the district court, is that wrong under Johnson?
MR. LANDSBERGs

We think it*s wrong undor the Voting

Rights Act, but I don't think that Johnson speaks to it.

I

think that the situation that Johnson speaks to is where the
court has formulated a plan.
QUESTION:

Is it a Waller situation when not the

State legislature but the Attorney General formulates and
submits a plan?
MR. LANDSBERGs

It is an attempt by the State in the

person of its counsel to administer a change.
QUESTION:

You make; that a Waller situation.

MR. LANDSBERGs

Yes, and I think that if one looks

at the purpose of the Voting Rights Act, the situation which
led to its enactment, that the procedures of the Voting Rights
Act were intended to apply not just to actions which the State

47
took legislatively, but also to voting practices which might
be imposed without the authority of State law perhaps, by
local officials or by local police juries or school boards.
QUESTION;

Suppose the State responds,in the example

that Mr. Justice Brennan and I war© talking about,

responds

and submits a plan and the court sa.ys, well, there are some
good parts to that, but seme good parts to the other side, too,
and I'm going to put them together, and it drafts its own plan
and it's half and half, half State, half the other party.
i

I take it you would say that the State was wholly disqualified
from even submitting a plan to the court until it had gone to
the Attorney General.
MR. LANDSBERG;
QUESTION;

That's right.

So that this court's order would be invalid

because in part, it rested on a State proffered plan.
MR. LANDSBERG:
QUESTION;

Not the ~

It's a very usual situation, you know.

MR. LANDSBERG;

that th® court should not rely

on th© State's plan until that plan has been precleared.

That's

what I think Congress very clearly stated in saying that
section 5 is intended to establish — this is on page 19 of our
brief -- a form of primary jurisdiction for section 5 review
under which courts dealing with voting discrimination issues
should defer in the first instance to the Attorney General or
to the District of Columbia District Court.

48
QUESTION:

I gather your submission is that a district

judge, not having any legislative plan tc propose to replace
an invalidated legislative plan , can formulate his own where
preclearance would not be required , only if whatever he
formulates has no input at all from ‘the State»
MR. LANDSBERG:

No, I wouldn't thin]-; we would go that

far.
QUESTION:

I thought what you just said --

MR. LANDSBERG:

No, I think that when the plaintiff

presents a plan, certainly the State would as a party to the
case have an opportunity to comment on any proposals that were
made.

If the court war® to appoint a special master«the same

would be true.
QUESTION:

Well, the conventional report^ the report

which you referred to, says that where the district court
directs an entity to adopt a new plan and present it to the
court for consideration.

You think it was referring to just

the business of the Attorney General at the .request of the court
submitting a recommended plan?
MR. LANDSBERG:
QUESTION:

I think it would cover that as well.

That's not adopting a plan.

It doesn’t

even purport to adopt a plan.
MR. LANDSBERG:

We get. the situation in this case we

have two sets of resolutions, on© of which says the school
board and police jury adopt a reapportionment plan and then

49
til© next time a resolution is passed by the police jury and
the school board saying, "We propose this plan."

Well, it. was

not formally adopted, but the effect of what they are trying
to do in both situations is precisely the same.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you to say that the court

*

could or could not develop a plan on its own motion?
MR. LANDSBERG:

I think that can only be done, as I

understand this Court's decisions, where there is some sort of
emergency situation and it's been unable to gat an acceptable
plan from the jurisdiction.

In the ordinary case, as in thi.s

case, there was a period of four months between the submission
of the plan and the trial, on the plan.

There was ample

opportunity for the political jurisdiction to submit the plan
to the Attorney General for his review in. the interim.
QUESTION:

Well, if the court is going to develop a

plan on its own motion, would you think the intervention or
suggestions from counsel for the State would then make that
something other than the court's plan for an emergency?
MR. LANDSBERG:

I think it would depend upon the

nature of -the input.
QUESTION:

Isn't the Attorney General of a State an

officer of the court on whom the court is always entitled to
call for suggestions and assistance?
MR. LANDSBERG:

Well, he is, but h® is also an

officer of the State and counsel for the State and is

50

representing the State in seeking permission to administer the
plan»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Your time is up, but I

think Mr. Justice Stevens had a question for you.
QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I just want to be sure I understand your position.
Supposing the plaintiffs submit the plan and the defendant,
the State subdivision, files a memorandum in which it suggests
to the court that th© plan have certain features in it.

Could

such a memorandum be filed without being submitted to the U.S.
Attorney General?
MR. IANDSBERG:

A memorandum in effect objecting to

certain
QUESTION:

Objecting and saying he thinks th® plan

the court is to adopt should have features A, B, and C in it.
MR. LANDSBERG:

Well, I think that would be a close

case.
QUESTION:

It just goes to the form of the submission

by the -MR. LANDSBERGs

I am trying to suggest it ought not

to be governed by th® form.

It ought to be governed by what

tha submission really is i in whatever form it is an attempt
by the State to administer a particular voting change, and that,
Congress has said, must bs subjected to the provisions of
section 5.

51
QUESTION:

So anybody can submit anything to the

judge but the State.
MR. LANDSBERG;

Well, w© are talking about the

unusual situation where —
QUESTION;

In the unusual — in your situation —

MR. LANDSBERG:
QUESTION;

The State may comment on what the ~~

The judge can look for advice to everybody

in the world except the State.
MR. LANDSBERG;

Th© court, may look to the State for

comments on what the other parties have submitted.
QUESTION;

Suppose the comment is, "I don't agree

with that because I agree with this.*
MR. LANDSBERG;

They couldn't take this.

There again I think we are getting

into a close area where one would have to look at the actual
document that's been filed.
QUESTION;

Well, you are suggesting, it sounds like,

that when a declaratory judgment is entered, the Attorney
General should retire the case for fear of poisoning the
resulting decree.
MR. LANPSBERG;

No, 1 think not.

I think what the

»

r

structure of -the Act intended to provide is that the Attorney
General would submit

it to the United States Attorney General

who in most instances has approved plans;: if the Attorney General
disapproves the plan, than the State should have an opportunity
to formulate a new one.

52

QUESTION;

Thank you, Mr. Landsberg.

Mr. Ward, do you hava anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. WARD, JR.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. WARD;

I will be very brief, your Honor.

I have somewhat the same problem with the section 5
argument that Mr. White has raised.
Government says

if

On the one hand the

the court finds a body malapportioned,

orders it to submit a plan, it submits a plan under a lawsuit
filed by a plaintiff, plaintiff submits a plan, let's say you
have an intervenor, also submits a plan.

If the court chooses

the plan submitted by the political subdivision it's subject
to section 5 review,- if it chooses —
QUESTION;

Or any part of it.

MR. WARD;

Or any part of it.

If it chooses on the

other hand the plaintiff's plan as being the best plan, it is
not subject to section 5 review.

The same would be true of

the intervenor plan, which seems to me to beg the question.
One plan the Voting Rights Act requires clearance by the
Attorney General, another plan having the same effect or a
different effect, but for the same purpose, is not subject to
preclearance.
This case, I think you can decide on its facts even
?

on the record before you without the update that the Aubaugh
opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed

53

the district court and held that an at-large plan discriminates
against blacks where blacks are in a majority in population
but slightly less than a majority in registered voters is not
in accord with your previous decisions in White v. Regester?
it is arguing over a minimal difference»

For example, the

voter registration figures at that time, 3,342 white, 2,899
black, a 443 more white registered voters than black»

My

figures as of when I filed my brief, new figures, were
3,550 black, 3,533, or 17 more black registered voters»
If you went to the registered Democrats, because in
my State we are almost a one-party system unfortunately, the
difference would be considerably greater in number of more
blacks registered than whites»

But when you go to Mr» Ilalpin's

figure, which he says he got by telephone call from the
Registrar, it shows as now more white registered voters than
black, but again a difference of only 242»

Between 17 to 242

to 443, that is such a minimal difference that it is virtually
impossible, or inconceivable to me that that makes an at-large
plan constitutionally impermissible, that slight difference»
In a parish with a majority population like this, black and
white pretty near equal, 55-58 percent black registered voters,
\

are going to vary from year to year depending on the age of
children, for one tiling»
Another thing that. I think you must r@me~ber, before
the Court of Appeals, this plan in effect, blacks have been

54

elected to the school board and have been elected to the
police jury»

I might direct your attention to the appendix

at pages 119 through 121, 1 believe, in which a member of the
policy jury is questioned during the hearing in July of '71
as to the town of Lake Providence, which is the only large
town in the parish»

And he is questioned as to the black

population being virtually almost 2 to 1 greater than, white.
He testifies also that part of that past history, no black had
ever been elected as alderman in the town of Lake Providence
even though they run at large and a black majority is almost
2 to 1.

But today, gentlemen, all five aldermen are black.

The mayor of the town is black.

The respondent himself, who

was previously defeated for the office of City Marshal
now been elected City Marshal

has

and is City Mar shell today.

I respectfully submit to you that under the facts and circum­
stances in this case, this plan is not unconstitutional.

The

Fifth Circuit’s an banc decision should be reversed and the
district court's original order implementing this at-large
system should ba approved.
Thank you.
MR. CHIBF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:24 p.m., oral argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
