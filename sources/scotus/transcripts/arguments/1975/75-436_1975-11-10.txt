ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH K. WINTER, JR.r ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR» WINTER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case was brought on January 2nd of this year,
the first business day after the effective date of the Federal
Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which I will refer to
as the FECA»

It. sought a declaratory judgment of unconstitu­

tionality and a permanent injunction against tine enforcement
of major provisions of that law, the 1971 Federal Election
Campaign Act, mid Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended by the FECA amendments.
Pursuant to the expedited review provisions, the case
was certified to the Court of Appeals for ‘the District of
Columbia Circuit.
After a remand to the District Court for fact finding,
a framing of the constitutional issues, and a recertification
to the Court of Appeals, the Court, of Appeals and a three-judge
District Court, considering only Subtitle H, rendered their
opinions on August 15.
•The majority below upheld the constitutionality of

5
every major provision of the law but on©»

That provision was

not appealed, and is not in issue here.
The allocation of argument for both sides will be as
follows 5
1 will discuss the statutory limits on campaign
expenditures by political parties, committees, and candidates,
limits on contributions to political candidates, and limits on
independent expenditures.
My colleague, Mr. Qora, will discuss the challenge to
the Act's disclosure provisions? and this afternoon Mr. Clagett
will argue the unconstitutionality of federal subsidies to
political candidates and parties and of the Federal Election
Commission.
For idi© appellees, Mr. Friedman will discuss general
principles and the disclosure provisions? Mr. Cox will discuss
the limits on expenditures and contributions.

In the afternoon,

Mr. Cutler will discuss Subtitle H? 'and Mr. Spritzer, the
constitutionality of the Federal Election Commission.
Let me briefly describe the statutory provisions
relevant to my portion of the argument.
Candidates for all federal offices are limited by
Section 803 in the amounts they may spend for purposes of
influencing an election.
National Committee and Stevie committees of a political
party may make expenditures on behalf of candidates which are

6
in addition to the candidate's expenditures.
Section 608(e) prohibits expenditures independent of
the candidate in excess of $1,000 so long as they are”relative
to a clearly identified candidate" and "advocating file election
or defeat of such candidate".
The statute also limite contributions to candidates.
Mo person may contribute in excess of $1,000 to any candidate
for federal office; and political committees, registered foxsix months, which have received contributions from more than 50
persons, and have contributed to five or more candidates for
federal office, may make contributions to individual candidates,
up to $5,000 each.
Candidates may expend personal funds or the funds of
their immediate family up to $50,000 in the case of a candidate
for President, $35,000 in the case of a candidate for the
Senate, and $25,000 in the case of a candidat® for the House.
Certain incidental out-of-pocket expense..» incurred
by volunteers in excess of $500 constitute a contribution.
QUESTIONi

Now, soma of these limitations are

true of all of them?

Yesf sir.

I’m not sure it makes any difference, sir.
Well, it would make a difference, I suppose,

if seme candidate was thinking about it and with one course of
action he might be subject to a criminal charge, or other
sanctions? and with the other course of action he’d be in the
clear.
MR. WINTER:

Well, that's certainly true.

But the

definition of expenditur® is for the purpose of influencing an
election.

And that's a factual determination to be made in each

9

case as to> which election the particular exaction was designed
to —* you know? was intended to influence.
S© ‘that conceivably under the Act, I take it, that
expenditures prior to a primary, prior to a nomination, can be
said by the Commission or by a court interpreting it to in fact,
have been for the purpose of the general election,

on© of

the principal duties of the Federal Election Commission will be
to allocate, to make a determination of which expenditures in
particular cases are for the purpose of which el@ct.ion.
The parties disagree as to the extant of congressional
power to regulate political communi cation under the First
Amendment, but they are agreed on on® thing:

which is that a

statute which intrudes in a delicate area of this matter must
be n©^discriminatory on its face.

For if it were not, the State

would be able to regulate "the unpopular and, in effect, regulat®
the content of speech.
I want to confront directly and in detail 'the con­
tention that the FECA is not facially discriminatory, for there
are several clear cases of facial unconstitutional!ty.
Section 608 limits contributions to and expenditures
by candidates, as defined in Section 591, essentially as any­
thing of value given or employed to influence a federal election.
Title 39 U.SoC., Section 3210, which is on page 81 of
our Volume III of the Appendix.

That Section, subsections (e)

and (f), makes explicit, exception to the definitions of

10

contributions and expenditures.

What the exceptions are are

funds used in preparing material to be sent out under the
frankr as well as the postal value of sending it out.
Section 3210(a)(3) defines the kinds of materials
that may be sent out under the frank.

That describes a variety

of relevant materials# which clearly influence elections, but,
most particularly, an influence, and I quota, "discussions of
proposed or pending legislation or governmental actions, and
the positions of the Members of Congress on an argument for or
against such matters.*
The only limitation is that the frank cannot b® used
within 28 days of an ©lection.
Nowt since the presentation of arguments for and
against actions by Congress obviously influence elections, the
effect is that Section 608 limits all contributions to or
•

}

expenditures by challengers for purposes of mailings which
debate governmental issues., while leaving totally unregulated
and unlimited private contributions to incumbents to prepare
material’

which is than sent out in unlimited amounts at

government expense.
Nc party to this litigation, so far as I know# dis­
agrees with this interpretation of the statute.

Indeed, even

in the proposed regulations of the Federal El@ct.ion Commission
relating to office accounts, the Commission was at pains not
to treat funds supporting the activities described in Section

11
3218 as either contributions or expenditures.
The issue w@ rai.se is not whether Congressmen should
bs able to communicate with their constituents.

The issue is

whether Congress, under the First Amendment, may by law limit
the ability of challenger© to communicate with the very same
constituents without similarly limiting itself.
Of course, public officials need to communicate with
voters, but so do challengers,

.and if private contributions to

challengers for use in mailings are to be limited, sine© they
may corrupt or give the wealthy an

unequal voice, then

contributions to incumbents for the same purpose should also be
limited.
The situation this statute establishes permits an
incmdx^afc Congressman, say, in a plausible hypothetical, to
accept $40,000 from a source, any source, which can then be used
to ~~ and that doesn’t have to be disclosed — which can then
b© used to prepare materials.

You can give them or you can hire

an advertising firm to prepare materials which can then be s@nt
out under the frank.
So that an incumbent Congressman might accept — give
an advertising agency, say, $35,000 to prepare materials, send
out 150,000 copies of something which I suppose is worth maybe
roughly $15,000? none of which counts
or an expenditure,

either as a contribution

if the challenger were to do exactly the

same thing with matters debating the pres and cons of govern™

12
mental action., it would all be subject to the limits.

And.

indeed, in the hypothetical I’ve given, a challenger in the
House would have used up well over half the expenditure limit,
and that's before he has hired his lawyer and his accountant
to help him comply with this statute.
QUESTIONS

Is this — are you directing yourself to

a Fifth Amendment attack or a First Amendment attack, or both?
MR. WINTERS

I think it's both, Justice Stewart,

It seems to me that it’s a Fifth Amendment
an invidious discrimination.

attack, in that it's

But. it's also a First Amendment

attack in that it clearly regulates content.

It permits more

speech, greater speech by incumbents than by challengers.
I think it is almost exactly the case that the Court
decided in Police Department v. Moaley, involving a statute that
prohibited all picketing, but picketing by a labor organisation.
So I think that, the attack goes on both grounds.
Now, if that's not facial discrimination, then these
words have lost their meaning.
QUESTION:

It’s not a minor exception,

But the First Amendment doesn't have much
'3-

«•

to do with discrimination as such, does it?
MR, WINTER: Well, I —
QUESTION: The Fifth Amendment does, of. qjurss.
MR. WINTER:

Yes, it doss.

I find it difficult.

Jus tic;® Stewart# though, to see why a statute which, prohibits
the speech of soma but not others in a discriminatory fashion

13

does not violate tha First Amendment -QUESTION?

Well,, insofar as it*s directed to content,

it certainly does.
MR® WINTER: Well, that is content in a very real, a
very, very real sense? and, not only that, the First Amendment
at the cor© is the protection of those outside the government.
This smacks very much of the repression of political opponents,
in that people outside the government are not allowed to speak
as much as people in, and I think that’s

if the Court finds

the statute does that, it's a clear violation of the First
Amendment.
It’s not a minor exception.
millions of dollars.

It involves millions and

More money is spent under frank by

Congressman than is spent by all congressional challengers on
all campaign activities.
In October 1974, on the eve of the congressional
©lection, the Congress which passed lection 608 sent out almost
22 million pieces of franked mail.

And the budget for 1976

includes $46 million for use of the frank.
Challengers to congressional incumbents in 574 spent
only slightly over 20 million on everything.
Let. roe make if clear, we claim no misuse of the
frank, we don’t say 3210 is unconstitutional.
legitimate official purposes.

It serves

Separating the proper use of the

frank from the. improper use is simply intractable.

It would

14
make every mailing of the frank a constitutional issue.

But

the frank does influence elections, and, as stipulated by the
parties and found by the District Court, its heaviest use is
just prior to ©lections.
Attempts in Congress by Senator Scott to have the
mailing privileges given to challengers, given to all candidates
for federal office, have been defeated.

It seems to

m® that

the frank cannot be used in this way, or that you can’t limit
challengers in responding without either giving them franking
privileges or limiting Congress’s own use of it.
We do not abandon, by any means, our other contention.
But if the Court were to find that this provision »«» these
provisions unconstitutional for these reasons, that would
dispose

that disposes of both contributions and expenditures

under 608, and the other constitutional issues can be left to
another day.
QUESTION s

Both for -the Senate and House end for

the presidency?
MR., WXNTERs

Yes, sir.

Not —- yes, sir ~~ the

presidency might be difficult because it’s penalty mail, but
I would simply —
QUESTIONs

Well, than, you do have to say something

else about the case, about the presidency case.
MR. WINTERS

Yes, sir.

The presidency mail situation, sir, is precisely the

15
same, the President also has mailing privileges which are vary
similar to those which incumbent Congressmen have.

I would

think that it would clearly ~~ the theory would clearly fit
within it# and# although 3210 doesn’t explicitly make the same
kind of explicit exception to the 591 definition# the case
there is exactly the same.

Trie President is permitted to send

out mailings like that.
The statute

1 should say that basically this argu­

ment# I think# is applicable to all of the many resources which
are. available to incumbents which they can vote themselves at
will# and which are detailed in the briefs and in the papers
of the parties# and I won’t go into.
l emphasised 3210 because it did have that, explicit
statutory language.
The FECA also »** and this applies to all federal
races —- facially discriminates against independent candidates
for office by permitting party committees to support their
candidates over and

above the candidat® expenditure limit.

Candidates such as Senator McCarthy# who wish to
demonstrate their independence from traditional political
alliances# can do so only at the price of having less power to
communicate with voters.
No matter how often the word "Watergate” is repeated#
it r&ally offers no valid explanation# much less justification.
Fourth# although the statute was passed in the midst

16
of rhetoric about reducing the influence of wealth and politics,
in fact increases the advantage of wealthy candidates.

A less

wealthy candidate is prohibited from raising Bseedtt money or
contributions for other purposes in amounts over a thousand
dollars.
The wealthy candidate, on the other hand, can support
his campaign from personal funds, including large early initial
loans to the campaign which can later b© repaid,
No reason which would stand scrutiny has been given
to justify giving the wealthy this advantage in communication
with voters.
Fifth, w© also claim that it‘s facial discrimination
for the statute to permit large contributions by political
committees which have been registered for six months.

They are

permitted to spend five times as much as other kinds of
committees, and we believe that that prevision necessarily
will help groups which have permanent organization —> which
have continuous professional contacts namely, organized
interest groups,
Ideology groups are less wall-knit, their members are
dispersed, they are not in continuous professional contact.
They tend to be generated by campaign activities which will
eccurr too late for compliance with the six-month requirement,
and they tend to coalesce only in response to unanticipated
events.

17
It is certainly fcru© that more ideological organiza­
tions/ such as tha national Committe® for an Effective Congress
or the Conservative Victory Fund, will continue to exist.

They

will, however, b® limited by the $5,000 limit# and will be less
able to proliferate the number of six-month committees in
existence»
Organized interest groups, at least those with a
geographic basis, which can organise horizontally, era able to
proliferate committees? end that's why it seems to us that it's
fairly clear that the practices of the

Dairy Industry, which

have been heavily relied upon in the court below, can continue
to occur under this statute, sine® they can organize their
political committees on a county basis.
Contrary to the rhetoric which accompanied passage
Of tha FECA, the statute in particular favors the use of
corporate and union money for political activities.

Both are

permitted to spend statutorily unlimited funds to raise money
for so-called segregated funds, to finance the six-month
political committees»

Union or corporat® money is thus spent

to raise money, and that money is distributed without reference
0

to wishes of the donors.
In effect, to some extant, the FECA reformed the
problem of legal corporate contributions by making them less
necessary.

This isn't speculation? since the enactment of the

statute there's been a very sharp increase in. the number of

18
corpora ;e political action cosranittees with no visible increase
in ideologically oriented groups.
I should say, the change in the statute in May was to
include corporations with government contracts in the provisions
permitting corporations to sat up segregated funds.
Sixth, whatever facial neutrality the statute may have,
it's only skin-deep.

In its operation it inevitably works great

discrimination among various candidates in various causes.
Candidates and political movements never begin from
positions of equality.

Soma who are initially disadvantaged,,

moreover, can overcome the disadvantage only by heavy spending,
no matter how much the opponent spends.
recognition, disadvantages on the issues.

Differences in name
The record indicates,

for example, in 1972, that Attorney General Kelly might well
have been able to wag® a stronger rae© against Sentor Griffin
had he been able to obtain a level of campaign spending enabling
him to focus the voters’ attention more on economic issues,
in which he was thought to foe strong, rather than on the raging
busing controversy, where he was thought to be weak.
In that kind of a situation, the busing was a contro­
versial issue, independent of any activities of Senator Griffin,
■and could be overcome only by a vigorous campaign by Senator
Kelly, no matter how many resources were available to Senator
Griffin.
Appellees believe these propositions are common-sense

19
propositions.

We don51 think there is speculation at ail.

Indeed, they are now the law of the PECA, according to a ruling
of the Commission.
In an advisory ruling involving Senator Bent,sen, the
Commission explicitly relied on the fact that an incumbent’s
exposure is the equivalent of substantial campaign expenditures.
Senator Bentsen has announced that, he intends to run in both
'the Texas presidential and senatorial primaries.
The Commission, fearful that his combined expenditures
will influence each of these simultaneous campaigns, ruled that
Senator Bentsan may only spend the amount permissible for the
Senate primary altogether.

His major anticipated adversary in

the presidential primary, Governor Wallace, is thus free to
outspend him two to one, since presidential primary candidates
can spend twice the Senate limit.
In handing down this ruling, the Commission said, and
I quota, "Within Texas, the reduced presidential primary
expenditure limitations applicable to Senator Bentsen ar©
compensated for by the fact that he is already the Senator
from Texas, and thus, within Texas, begins with a significant
exposure advantage over his rival."
QUESTIONs

Mr. Winter, how much can we get into a

particular ruling like that?

I mean, Senator Bentsen isn't a

party hare, Governor Wallace isn't a party*
MR. WINTER?

The point I’m making, Justice Rehnquist,

20

is that while the Commission in this Court is claiming that kind
of proposition is speculation and would not justify the Court
holding expenditure limits unconstitutional for the reasons
I’ve said»
The point is that they, themselves, are relying on that
proposition to make decisions below.

I'm not arguing whether

•the ruling was correct or incorrect.

I’m just arguing that it’s

a well-known proposition, known to everyone, so well-known that
the Commission relied on i.t and had no problema whatsoever.
And I think these propositions are as much common™
sens© propositions as the proposition that equal space statutes»
say in Torn11la, mad© to deter newspapers from printing con™
troversial editorials, I think every First Amendment of this
Court involves judgments as to the factual impact of the
statute.
QUESTIONS But in Tornill© we were discussing the
language of the statute as such, that is, as applied by tire
Florida courts? and her© you're asking us to take into con™
©iteration a ruling by the Commission in a particular contro­
versy o
MR. WINTER;

I’m only asking you to take the rationale

into consideration, I’m not asking you to address yourself to
the merits of whether Governor Wallace and other presidential
aspirants should be able to outapend Senator Bantsen two to
one.

1 think the merits of that are irrelevant to the argument

21
hara, except insofar as they demonstrate the belief of those
— the widespread belief that exposure is the equivalent of
substantial campaign expenditures»
They are also relevant, I might say, to show the kind
of deep intrusion the statute makes, in that the Commission will
be asked time and again to address the question:

How

much

will this candidate be able to spend on an election and how
much will another?
I*ffi not sure I*m being responsive, Justice
<

Rehnquist,
I think that similar disadvantages are visited upon
challengers by the limits on contributions.

Incumbents have,

as we desribe in our papers, large advantages in raising
contributions under this statute, because of mailing lists they
have developed from the frank, and the like.
Indeed, although on® might have anticipated that fundraising would be more difficult, the figures show that by
September 30th of this year, incumbent Senators up next tiro®
have already raised over two million dollars? at a corresponding
time in *74 they had raised less than a million and a half.
So they1 re not having any trouble raising it, because they
have all of this time to raise it, which challengers don’t, and
tiro® is critical when you*re raising small contributions.
»

There is on® argument — well, the argument -that the
statute helps challengers, because it offsets the superior fund-

22

raising ability of incumbents, seems to us to be in error»
The greatest differential in funds is in those races in which
the challenger simply has little or no plausible chance of
©lection.
The limits in those circumstances h&v© little impact#
because the outcome is certain and because sp@sndi.ng is often
less -chan the limit.
The impact on those races which are competitive#
however, will be drastic.

But those races are the very races

in which the differential in funds is least.
Thus, in 1974 in the House, if you take all the races
in which the challenger did raise 70,000 or more, the amounts
raised by all such challengers in fast substantially exceeded
the amounts raised by the incumbents they faced.

The limits

h&v© already had an effect on those races where equality is
greatest at the present moment.
The burden of the FEC& thus falls heavily on those
challenging the status quo, by impairing the ability of
challengers, both to raise and spend money, this legislation
makes it acutely difficult for the® to overcome the. exposure
incumbent® already enjoy.
I don't think there could be any question about this.
If there were five restaurants in a town, and someone was about
to open a new one, an ordinance severely limiting the amount of
newspaper advertising restaurants might buy would be recognised

23
by all for what it is:

an attempt by the existing restaurants

to freeze out newcomers,
I don't make claim of intent on the part of Congress
to drive out or to freeze out newcomers,

I do claim, however-

that the effects will h© to do that.
I think the record demonstrates thesa propositions.
The vast majority of congressional challengers in the last two
elections have spent over what are new the PEC limits, if
appropriate adjustments are made for inflation.
Senator McCarthy's 1968 Mew Hampshire campaign, which
seemed hopeless in the beginning, which was widely reported as
a campaign run mostly by volunteers, was in fact a vary heavily
moneyed campaign, one of the most moneyed campaigns up to date.
Senator McCarthy spent $12 par vote received, as against 11 cants
spent in the general ©lection by Richard Nixon.
In adjusting for inflation, that's around $18.

If his

spending had been otherwise, the outcome would have been other­
wise —* had keen limited, the outcome would have been otherwisei and the efforts of his many volunteer supporters, who were
also helped by the heavy spending, would have bean for naught.
The same is true of the reliance of challengers on
large contributions.

Again, the McCarthy campaign in '68 is

detailed in the record, as is Senator Stackley's 1970 campaign,
in which the landlords and the phone company wouldn't even talk
te him unless he came up with certified checks for $36,000.

24
His beginning efforts wer© financed through a large loan which
the FECA would outlaw.
The record also demonstrates, beyond any question,
that Senator McGovern*s campaign would have foundered if the
FEGA had been in effect.
From the beginning of his campaign until the Mew
Hampshire primary —- until three days after the Mew Hampshire
primary, Sanator McGovern would have lost $636,882 in contribu­
tions, sine® the direct-mail techniques on which he was relying
heavily require that much ©f the contributions of the return
on contributions b® plowed back in, these large contributions
had to be critical to his early efforts.
The answer to the question, Is this law the reform it
claims to be, is clearly no.

ness of disclosure.

In going to the record, it appears in 1972

that large, large numbers of the large contributions and the
suspicious contributions which led to the passage of the FECA
were passed before the disclosure provisions were in effect,
or after the election, when it was too late for them to go

k fo r® the record.

25
The: appellees state that 153 contributors gav® $20
million to the Nixon campaign.

From the source they cited* we

calculate that 16 million of that was given before April 7th,
1972.

All

parties have agreed* and the District Court found,

that there was no effective disclosure before that date»
Indeed, on April 5th and April 6th, 5.5 million was
raised* and a total of 20 million was raised by the Nixon
campaign before the disclosure date.
Agreed finding 147 on pag© 204 to 05 ©f Appendix II
lists contributions solicited by Herbert Kalmbach; 83 percent
were mads before April 7th.
Agreed finding 124, page 155, lists contributions by
Ambassadors appointed by President Nixon.
QUESTION:

Mr» Winter, from reading the briefs on -the

other aid®, with all their figures, and all these figures you’ve
been throwing at us for the last half hour, what ar© we going to
do* put them all in a computer?
MR. WINTER:

I don’t think that the figures that I*vs

been throwing at you, Justice Marshall, need to go in a com­
puter.

It seems to me that these ar® ~~ if this statute —*
QUESTION:

In the first place, we don’t have on®,

I just war:tec. to advise you of that.
[Laughtar.J
MR. WINTER:

That made my answer to the question easy.

It seems to me that most of the figures that are

26
there are fairly clear in their import, and there is another
factor which I think is critical!

that is, if the statute is

upheld, you lose the control group.

You will never again have

high-spending challengers t© look to to see whether high spending
is necessary for them to defeat incumbents.

One© the statute

is in effect and running, there will h® no more figures before
you, or before any court, to be able to demonstrate what effect
this statute is having.
These are the only figuras that are ever going to b©
available to make a thorough judgment on th© constitutionality
of this law.
Th© only figures you will have from now on ar© th®
incumbency rate, you will never know whether high-spending
challengers «- whether the high spending is necessary to
challengers ©r not.
The figures l1® discussing right now demonstrate,
in their totality, only that both large contributors and
contributors with improper motives fear disclosure to the voter.
QUESTION* Well, Mr. Winter, is it your contention
that these people would not have contributed had they had to
do so under a disclosure requirement?
MR. WINTER:
large number of cases.

I think that's very

likely true in a

I would say —*

QUESTION: But what's your basis for that?

It doesn’t

seem to me it's proved by showing that because they could con-

27
tribute without any disclosure before April 7th, they chose to
do that rather than contribute after April 7th.
MR. WINTER: Well, I think that the best, way — I,
of course, cannot give an unequivocal answer that they would not
have contributed.

But April 7th is a very, very early date,

end contributions, large contributions after an ©lection or too
late for disclosure, particularly in an election like 1972
where there was little doubt about the outcome, it seems to me,.
strongly suggests a powerful desire to avoid disclosure.
New, whether they would have given or not, I don’t
know.

I suspect the milk people 'probably would not have.

I suspect in the case of the Ambassadorships, they probably
would not have.
But disclosure doss have on© virtu© that no other
remedy has, and that is, it leaves it to the voter.

Even if

they did continue to give, the voter would foe afola to decide
in each case whether h©

whether that voter thought that a

particular candidate was going to be overly beholden to, if
V*v

you want to call them, special interests * was receiving very
large contributions from a particular source.
Whether people will continue to give after effective
disclosure depends on what the voters think.

And that is the

way it should be in a democratic system.
QUESTION: Well, but, now, Congress has apparently
decided otherwise in this case. They have said that they don’t

28

want; people to appear to be beholden # even though the voters#
knowing that they appear to b® beholdenr would, nonetheless,
elect them*

Is that an impermissible judgment for Congress to

make?
MR* WINTER*

I don’t *— I don’t *-» yes, I think it is

impermissible for Congress t© attempt to bring about these
remedies by lowering the level of political communication, when
disclosure is available# and when other remedies are also avail­
able; remedies such as prohibitions on larga late contribution®#
which is certainly a viable remedy# it responds to everything
that was cited in support of. the FECA, and it is not in the
statute*
I think that while Congress # in deciding to have
disclosure# has considerable discretion in determining what kind
©£ disclosure and when# but X don't think that' they can really
try — that they can remedy this by stopping essentially
political speech *
Certainly# limits on candidate expenditures# Justice
Rehnquist# cannot ba justified by any theory that the FEC —
any evil the FEC claims to reme-jy.

Clearly # limits on

independent expenditures# it seams to me# can’t be justified
that way.

Tha problem has to be, if there is a problem, in the
©quality argument and in the argument that candidates, ©no© they
assume office# will b© overly beholden and obligated to certain

29
contributors *
In the case of the equality argumentt 1 think it is
demonstrated in the record that you cannot bring about ©quality
without producing more inequality*
itself.

Either that or silence

That the challengers, people challenging the status

quo/. rely heavily on money and you have to

if you have to

frees© them out in the name of equality, and that's wrong.
Second# equality is an impermissible goal, in any
event, because the danger sought to be remedied when you try
to reduos equality# inequality and political voice; th® danger
stems from the communicative natura of th© het itself, it's
not. like 0*Brian, where you had a congressional purpose unrelated
to free speech*

It's like Tinker and other cases, where the

danger was perceived in the communicative act.
Sot as for th© obligation of candidates, I ‘think
candidates are obligated to their voters.
they don’t want money.

They want votes#

They need money to communicate with the

voters, and 1 think their ultimate obligation is to them, and
I think if there is effective disclosure, they will not become
.overly burdened with obligations.
1 might also say, if you speculate for a moment about
when obligations are most likely to be created, it won’t ba in
the case ©£ safe seeds, it will be in th® case of close or
highly competitive seeds.
to run affectiv© campaigns»

That's where people do need money

30
But these are also cases in which the person has to
b® tli© most fearful of what the voter thinks» has to b® th©
most sensitive to voters' wishes*
safe,

When you’re dealing with

seeds, large contributions do create real dangers«

But

th© remedy for that is to be sure that the candidate receiving
the contributions makes expenditures only for voter persuasion»
and is not permitted» as the present statute doss — permits
him to us® campaign funds for a variety of non-speech purposes*
By regulating expenditures, you can solve th® obligation problem,
in safe seeds.
Wow» there virtually are large numbers ©£ th© con­
tributions •»»* large contributions or improper contributions —

It seems to hi© that Hew

Letter Carriers are not inconsistent» that the principle of
noninterference in political communication in ©vary case is
consistent with the outcome in those decisions.
It seems to me that this statute, fcher® is no way that
this statute can be viewed other than as an attempt to regulate
political communication? .indeed» t© regulate the content of
political communication by an intricate web of statutory and
administrative rulings which redirect and rechannel political

Mr. Gora.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL M. GORA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GORAs

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it pleas® the

Courti
1 will address myself to the disclosure provisions
of the challenged legislation, -and in that argument I occupy#
I think# a unique rol® in this proceeding# in -that these are
provisions that w© do not challenge as inherently invalid.
In fact# w@ think# as Prefeasor Winter indicated# that disclosure
provisions proparly and carefully drawn to focus on 'the problems
that generated this legislation provida the proper solution#
QUESTION*

How# are yon going to argue that the

present disclosure provisions do this?
MR. GORAi

They do# but# unfortunately# Justice

Brennan# they do much store than that.

By virtue of ’their sweep#

in terms of the coverage and in terms of the depth of reporting,
they go well beyond# in our submission# the valid area of
regulation supported by governmental interests.
QUESTION;

Do you relate that to the amounts?

32

MR. GORA:

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justic®.

Both th@

amounts, in terras of th@ threshold of reporting, and the scop®,
in terms of who is covered.
This statute requires that all political committees
must keep a detailed and exact account of the identification ■*—
that's a statutory tana, it means name and resident address ~~
the identification of each person who contributes in excess of
$10 a year.

That's a virtual monitoring of everyone who makes

a political contribution in the United States.
Similarly, all candidates and political committees,
whether they be the committe® to Reelect the President or a
local sxaall-rainority party in California, all political commit-?
teas for all offices have to file reports disclosing the identity
of their contributors in excess of $100 a year.
and# finally# any citizen who# on his own, spends more
than $100 a year on federal politias# independent of any
candidate# just go®s out mid prints up some leaflets attacking
his local Member of congress, must register and file reports
with this Commission, indicating til© source and nature of his
expenditures, his funds *
QUESTIONS
MR. GORA:

What, is the penalty for failure to comply?
The penalty for noncomplianc® with the

disclosure reporting requirements is# I believe, on® year in
jail and I believe it's $1,000 fin®.
QUESTION; For a citizen who fails to report a $.109

33
contxibution?
MR. GORA:
of contribution.

A himdred-dollar independent expenditure

If I, for @x&:api@, run an ad in the Village

Voice in New York or some comparable paper, spend $125 on it,
saying, “Defeat so-and-so, Vote for so-and-so", 2 have to file
a detailed report with the Commission, giving the source of w
money, how it was spent and so forth.
QUESTIONs

Well, if we were to agree that to that

extent the disclosure previsions g© too far, and strike them to
that extent, would you then be satisfied with what*a left?
MR. GORA: Well, striking independent — the disclosure
requirements of independent speech
QUESTION:
MR, GORA:

Thee© aspects of it,
Yes, I think we would, Your Honor,

I think

if this Court w@r© to indicate that the statute reached too
deeply in terms of the threshold and swept too widely in terms
of the reach, yes, we would be ■— that’s our position, that
it’s not properly focused to those interests that the government

cm, properly require disclosure for it.
The problem is that the government interests and
association©! privacy run up ©gainst, each other in this area,
depending on where Congress draws the line will determine, for
example, for a small or unpopular party, whether they in their
adherence are going to be essentially free from government
harassment or have to expose their contributors.

34
But even for th© contributor to a major — the
Democrats or the Republicans , the $125 contributor, where the
threshold is drawn is going to detersaine whether his name might
go on an enemies list or not.
And we suggest that we*re *—
QUESTIOH:

Well, except for its being very awkward

and unwieldy, perhaps, and maybe impractical to sweep so broadly,
how, constitutionally, does it differ?

How, constitutionally,

is it a greater violation of John Jones * s rights to privat®
associations! confidentiality if his $125 expenditure needs to
be recorded, how is that a greater violation than it is with
Mr, Mott’s or Mr. Stone’s rights if, as you concede, Congress
could enact a statutory provision requiring that he make a
disclosure of his mi11ion™dollar contribution?
MR, GOEls

1 think in principle

QUESTION: What's th© difference?
MR, GORA:

There is no differences.

However, I think

that disclosure of one’s political activities at whatever volume
is presumptively invalid.

But, at th® volume of th© large con~

tribufcion, counterveiling government interests in informing the
electorate of those individuals 'who make large contributions\
in preventing corruption, those counterveiling interests com©
into play.
So that that’s how X would make, the distinction
between th® interest in knowing ~ in breaching the privacy

35

of the $125 contributor and the interests in breaching the
political privacy of the $125,000 contributor.

That’s how 1

would draw the line»
QUESTION s
you.

One other question now that lfve interrupted

You said you'd b® quite satisfied if the —* with what

would be left after the Court accepted your position and struck
down these disclosure provisions.

What would be left, vis-a-vis

disclosure?
Nothing, would it?
MR. GOpa:

Well, it would depend on how the Court

chos© to approach that remedy. There is a severability section
in the disclosure provisions, which —
QUESTION:

Well, but you say you'd,to© quit© satis­

fied with what would b© left with respect to disclosure requirerants after we struck down what you tell us we should strike
down.

That is, after we had held that the Constitution makes

it impermissible.

There would be nothing

left with respect to

any disclosure requirements, would there?
MR. GOR&s

You mean in terras of this present statute?

QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR® GORA:

Nell, that would depend, Justice Stewart,

on the remedy that this Court chose to employ.
Now, in terms of dealing with sweeping and overbroad
statutes, on© remedy, the potent medicine, is to invalidate it,
on its face.

I'm not sura that's necessary her©.

36

Section 454 of the Act has a, in effect, severability
section, which readss

"if any provision of this title or the

application thereof to any parson or circumstance is held
invalid, the rest of the Act stands.”
If this Court were to determine, for example, that
the failure to make distinctions between the two major parties
and all the other small minor parties, in terms of disclosure,
warranted invalidating the statute, I assume a ruling of that
kind would leave the regular disclosure provisions in effect»
It might be more difficult for the Court to make

&

separation out in terms of the thresholds, 1 would grant that»
But I think that the statute itself obviously contains lines
for separating out major and minor parties»
QUESTION:

Mr. Cora, how long have we had disclosure

in political contributions in this country?
MR. GORA:

Technically, Justice Marshall, since 1910»

Practically, since April 7th, 1972.
QUESTION:

Well, you say it’s bad; it’s been bad all

that time?
MR» GQRA*

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

It’s been bad all that time?

MR. GORA:

It just hasn’t bean challenged, that, we’re

aware of, in terms of the kinds of First Amendment association
and political privacy arguments that we’re making here.
QUESTION:

How many States have disclosure provisions?

37
MR. GOES.;

Justice White, the bulk of them do.

The

count varies, you get a different figure.* in each of the briefs
on the other side.
QUESTION:

And would the bulk of those be vulnerable

lander your approach?
MR* GORA:

I think not necessarily, I think there are

two differences*
We argue the minor-party point and the threshold point.
New, it seems to me that at the State level, the level of
spending for any comparable race, a State Sanate seat, a State
Assembly seat, a Governor's seat, is probably, on the whole,
much lower than the level of spending in any comparable
congressional or presidential race.

I doubt that there are

very many congressional *>■-* pardon me, State Representative
races that spend 70 or 80 or 100 thousand dollars.
QUESTION»

So that —

Are you, suggesting that constitutionally

the State css® could come out differently than this one?
MR* GORA:

Yes.

I'm suggesting that it might be

shown that since the average that's spent, let's say, in a House
race, in a State Assembly race, is $20,000} -that -this Court
might find a threshold disclosure there might have to be lower
than it is in the case where the spending limits in a congres­
sional race are $100,000.
QUESTION:
•threshold figure,

So we should pick out some figure, some

38
MR* GORAs

No# ::'m not suggesting that.

All I

I'm

trying to respond to your concern about the effect of the
decision that we seek on State law# and I’m suggesting that in
terms of threshold# the difference between federal ©lections
and State elections is such that it wouldn't necessarily b©
controlling*
And I would say the same tiling about the problem of
minority parties*
QUESTION;

Well# before you leave that point# if we

say $100 is too low a threshold# we would surely have to
articulate some basis for our reasoning as to why $100 is too
low but some other figure would be acceptable*
MR, GORA:

Well# 1 think the basis is to look to the

purpose of disclosure.

The primary purpose that has been

advanced for it is the preventing of corruption and improper
influence on governmental officials*
1 think this Court could# in a constitutional way,
require that the disclosure provisions be geared t© the level
at which improper influence can b® brought to bear by virtue
of the contribution,
QUESTION;
MR, GORA;

Can you pinpoint that point# Mr* Gora?
Well, I think, Justice Brennan

I don’t

think it's this Court's obligation to pinpoint that# I think
it's
QUESTION; Wall# are you suggesting that we should

39

pick out a thousand"-dollar figure, 500# ot some such?
iRc GORA:

Ho.

No.

1 think that this Court should

require the Congress to look at these problems and to draw some
lines.

I've looked at a good chunk of the legislative
QUESTIONt

1 must say# if that's so# then the answer

to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question is that there isn’t anything
left and we'd have to strike it down facially# wouldn’t we?
MR. GOJRAs

Well# there I think there is a difference

between the minority party point# where there are lines in the
other sections of this Act# regrettably# lines which discrimin­
ate against a minority party# and the threshold problem# which
is a little harder to make distinctions on.
But 1 would suggest that the problem is that Congress
seemed to me# in my study of the legislative history# to be
essentially indifferent to these problems.

And I think what we

would request of this Court is -chat Congress be required to
think about these things# to think about whether you really
want to require the public identification of the $125 contri­
butor to the small party or even, to the presidential party.
QUESTION; Well# should we include that in our opinion#
that the Congress ought to think more, carefully about this?
MR. GORA; Well# one would certainly hope so# but I
think that# as I said# there are bases in the statute# Justice
Rehnquist# for invalidating the application to small and minor
parties.

The threshold problem presents a different one.

40
QUESTION•
there is

no

I take your argument,* Mr. Gc-ra., to b© that

valid, rational public interest in flushing out and

publicising the nasr.es of $.100 contributors or $101 contributors,
none that can be justified constitutionally? but that there is,
indeed, a real public interest in knowing about 10,000 ©r
100,000 or 500,000.

Is that your *—

MR= GORas

Yes, that is our position, and we*re

QUESTIONS

But you’re saying that you can’t pick the

saying —»

point where the line should be drawn.
MR» GOBAs Well, again, the point, I think, has to be
attempted to be drawn in reference to the purpose of having
disclosure»

The purpose is not just promiscuous, to find out

whether your neighbor gives 125 bucks to the local congressional
candidate.

There is a presumption that one’s politics are

one * s own businass.
That's why, when the purpose is in terms of the
prevention of corruption, then this Court arid the Congress must
ask whether the disclosure levels are drawn to meet that purpose.
QUESTION:

You must mean in there that the public,

the public interest in knowing about the large

on®

is that

10,000 or 100,000 or 500,000 might conceivably buy something
improperly, but that 100 or 125 could not conceivably buy
anything *—
MR. GORA:

Precisely our point.

41
QUESTION*

— these days, at least»

[Laughter»j
MR» GOR&s

Yes, Mr» chief Justice? that’s our point»

QUESTION*

It doesn't buy much radio time, it doesn't

buy much newspaper space, and certainly not much influence.
MR. GQRA:
QUESTION:

That’a the argument»
And when you get to figuring it# will it

go up each year according to the cost of living?
MR» GORA:

Wellt I think it certainly might.

there are cost-of-living adjustments in the statute.

X

mean,

But again

I think that the major point we're trying to make is that this
Court has to require the Congress to think about these problems,
to think about these line-drawing problems, both in terms of
the threshold of reporting the $10 recordkeeping and the $100
reporting, and in terms of th© application to minor parties.
Finally, let me just turn for a moment to section
434(e).

As X indicated in response to questions, that section

requires that any privat® citizen ~~ it has nothing to do with
the candidate, political committee, not making contribution to
a counter political committee — wants to get involved in
political activity, wants to condemn his local Congressman
and run off some leaflets and spend more than $100 doing it,
that person has to register with th© Federal Election Commission
and supply the reports required of political committees.
We think that provision is virtually impossible to

42

justify.

It seems to us that it is flatly in contravention

©£ the principles in the Talley case, where this Court protected
the right of political speech and anonymity? and we think it is
</,bO

in conflict with the principles of the Thomas ease, where

this Court rejected the application of just a mere registration
requirement upon giving a speech,
Section 4341®) runs afoul of both of those decisions.
And let me, finally, if I might — in terms of the
discrimination against small and minor parties that -tills
disclosure statist© involvas, it has been our contention that
Congress simply failed to consider what alternatives were
available to deal with the valid interests served by disclosure.
The same Act which did draw sharp and unconstitutional
distinctions, when it came to disbursing the benefit of public
financing, for example, drew no such distinctions in imposing
the burdens on associations . entailed in reporting and
I

disclosure.
Instead, Congress indiscriminately cast a net across
the entire range of political association that is manifest by
contributions to a party9 without regard to the very widely
varying .interests at stake.
Analytically this Court found such an approach
insufficient in Rebel and. the other Communist membership cases,
and we would submit that it. should find that approach insuffi­
cient here.

43

QUESTION;

Mr. Gora, unless I missed something, and

perhaps I did. 1 think neither you nor Mr. Winter specifically
separated and identified section 608(e) for special attention?
did you?
MR. GORA:

Mo,, we have not.

Section 608(e) is a flat

ceiling on the speech of persons completely unconnected to any
political candidate or committee.

In a statute with a lot of

imconstitutionality # w@ submit that that stands out.
QUESTIONS Well, I should think if there’s a problem
in requiring someone who spend $100 to disclose it# 'Hiare would
be even more of a problem in flatly prohibiting a person from
spending over a thousand dollars.
MR. GQRhi

That is our submission# Mr. Justice

Rahnquist.
Thank you# Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Gora.

Mr. Friedman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FRIEDMANt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As has been indicated, I will begin by outlining the
problems that Congress was dealing with in this statutet .and then
rather briefly showing how the particular solutions selected
accomplish those objectives? and then I will discuss in some

44
detail the reporting and disclosure provisions.

Mr. Cos will

then follow and discuss the contribution and expenditure
limitations»
Since early in this century there has been, in the
language of this Court in the Auto Workers case, a long series
of congressional efforts calculated to avoid the deleterious
influences on federal elections resulting from use of money by
these who exercise control over large aggregations of capital.
Congress first faced this problem back in 190? by
enacting a statute prohibiting certain contributions by corpora­
tions in connection with ©lections.
In the Auto Workers case, this Court traced at some
length the history of the congressional regulation of this
problem*

It. was described as a series of acts to protect, the

political process from what Congress deemed to b© the corroding
effect of money employed in elections by aggregated power.
Unfortunately, however, as these statutes war© enacted,
they proved to have so many loopholes that they were virtually
ineffective in doing anything about the problem.
And beginning in the 1960's,» in the late 1960*s.
Congress held a series of detailed hearings exploring all
aspects of the problem.

These culminated in a 1971 Act, the

initial Federal Election Campaign Act, and was followed by the
present amendments in 1974

*

Wow, this statute, therefore, is not something that

45
cams out ©£ -the blue, it represents the result of many, many

■

years of study, three-quarters ©£ a century, by the Congress,
the. body that is particularly ©sspert in knowing the problems
resulting from the use of money# the corrupting effect of money
on federal elections, and Congress has studied the problem# has
recognised that when things do not work# changes are necessary?
and Congress has been willing to chang@ in this area, and to
try to devise a scheme that will once and for @11# we hop©# put
an ©nd to this problem,,
The present statute, of course# is a direct outgrowth
of fch© disclosures of the 1972 campaign.

There’s no need to go

into any detail of that sorry and sordid story? it*s set out
in the record, it's a matter of public knowledge, the huge
campaign contributions# the gifts from people who wanted to be
Ambassadors# the campaign’s specific large contributions in
connection with anticipated favorable government action# such
as the milk producers, a large number of corporat© officials
who were convicted, and many of whom pleaded guilty to illegal
campaign contributions.

And the evidence that developed

of the vast incare as© in th© cost of campaigns in this country.
QUESTION:

Mr, Fri©dman# whan you spaak of three-

quarters of a century of study of this problem by th© Congress#
do you suggest that that was sustained study or sporadic study?

MR. FRIEDMANs

X would say# Mr. Chief Justice, it was

sporadic in. the sens© that., Congress was not constantly looking

4S

at the probi®*», but over a number of times, there are a large
number of statutes over the years# starting in 190? and 1910,
in the middle of the second decade the Corrupt Practices hot of
1925, gradually over the years congress realized that what it

had dones up to then was not enough to solve the problem, and
it looked at the situation and devised what appeared to be more
and more comprehensive regulatory things,

It expanded the type

of controls, it expanded during the war the prohibition on
gifts from corporations to unions; as problems developed,
Congress studied them.
But my point is that over a long period of time
Congress has considered these problems, studied them and devised
schemes to deal with, what it perceived to be an increasingly
serious evil in the body politic, the corruption of federal
elections by the us® of money«
and the cost of these campaigns has risen at a
staggering rata, really a staggering rat®.

On page 35 of Mr,

Cox’s brief there's a chart which shows the increase in campaign
costs reflected to show increases in the consumer price index*
/sio/

And what it shows is that over a twenty-year period, from 1952
to 1972, after adjustments to reflect increases in the cost of

reversa
order/

living, the cost of congressional races increased more than

300 percent; and over the ten-year period 1962 to IS72, the
cost of presidential races, with a similar adjustment, increased
more than 450 percent.

And by .1972 it was estimated that the

4?
total cost of elections in this country exceeded approximately
$400 millionc
Now, what is the consequence of this escalating cost?
It’s & vicious circle, because when one candidate sees another
candidate spending more and more, he feels impelled to spend
more and more.

As the cost of these campaigns increase, the

candidates naturally turn to where the money is, the easiest
source of money, those ©f the wealthy interests.
Once a wealthy interest gives a campaign contribution,
his competitors, other businessmen, also feel obliged to give,
because they're concerned that if they don't give, either they
will be discriminated against by government officials, or their
competitors will gain an

advantage as a result of these

contributions.
And thus the candidates, as a result of this thing,
feel more and more obligated to the sources, the large sources
of campaign contributions.
And it’a not surprising, with this history, -that by
the early 1970's there was a tremendous feeling in this country
that you couldn't trust the government? a lack of electorate
confidence in our gov@rnm.tnt officials? the notion that somehow
people could h© bought.

If you gave enough money — if you gave

enough money, people could fa© bought.
And conversely —» correspondingly, really, the average
man who is not very affluent, who didn't have access to all these

48
sources# he believed that it was rattier futile for him to try
to play ®n active role in the campaign.
For one thing# if he wanted to run for office, he knew
h® couldn't raise these sources of money.

And# secondly# if h®

wanted to try —

MR. FRIEjDMA$;

It may not be quite as simple, Mr.

many campaigns in recent years the same interests have contributed
to two candidates who ar® running against each other.

QUESTIONt

But if it’s the same amount of money, it's

the same as though that donor had mad® no contribution at all,
isn't it?
MR* FRXEBMANs

Well, perhaps end perhaps not»

But

with this exception, Mr* Justice, that both of these pcsopl®,
whoever is the victor, is likely to feel the sans® of obliga­
tion to the parson who gave him this contribution*

This «*»

And h© hopes the victor never hears about

the contribution to the loser.
MR, FRIEDMANs
QUESTIONi

I'm sorry?

The donor hopes the victorious condidata

doesn't hear about the donor’s contribution to the loser*
MR* FRIEDMAN:

I would assum® so*

I suspect perhaps

so:®© people in th® Congress are aware of this, and I think this
is one? of tli© things that influenced them to require both limits
on contributions and disclosure*
QUESTION:

Let's analyse that a little bit.

You made

it as a. very broad general statement*
Would you see any corrupt or improper motive if a
vary wealthy man said that he

would put up half a million dollars

or si million, whatever it takes, for a series of three national
television debates between two candidates, or within a State

50
if it*s a senatorial race,.
How# he’s contributing to both sidas,- isn’t he, when
ha finances that?

Anything improper in that?

' MR.» FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

Or is that —

No# no, this —

**•“ Could that b© explained by a dedication

to the First Amendment idea that th© issues should be debated?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Surely# Mr. Chief Justice# but that 1

don’t think was the problem that concerned Congress in this
leg is; lation«
QUESTION:

But th© limits would apply.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Th® limits

th© limits would apply

if — wail# it would depend whether this — they may not apply#
because that would not be# I don't think# a contribution directed
to the influencing of th© election or nomination of a' particular
candidate.

X don’t think there would be anything in th®

statute prohibiting that kind of a sponsorship of a public
forum.
QUESTIONz

And another occasion# in the situation you

hypothesised with Mr. Justice Stewart# a man giving $10#000 to
each of the two major party candidates perhaps just wants to
make sure that one of two men that he regards as responsible
will be elected and that the third-party candidat® will not be
elected.

Those are all valid motivations# ar® they not?
MR. FRIEDMANt

Those would be valid motivations # Mr.

Chief Justice; but I think that has to be weighed against the

51
judgment of Congress that; overfall, over®*all, the evils
resulting from the substantial increase in campaign spending
and the giving of large contributions , that these evils are
such as to require some regulation to try to stop this increasing
spiral of campaign costs, and try to restore public confidence»
I think it’s an important element that the lack of
public confidence, if 'the public believes -> if - the public
believes that large contributions have a corrupting effect upon
'the electoral process and upon government, and the record hare
contains a lot of evidence to that effect, that is a valid
consideration for Congress to take into account.
QUESTIONi Well, I took the argument of your friends to
mean that, yes, indeed, there is public interest in limiting
expenditures, but that when balanced ©gainst the First Amendment
rights of the small contributor, the First Amendment rights
should prevail over a $100 limit.
What do you have to say about that?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Well, let me, if I may, that’s the

$100 disclosure limit, on the email contributor it’s $1,000.
Our answer to that is that disclosure -QUESTION;

That’s the limit of •»« the limit that he

can give without having his name flushed out.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Without having his -« yes, but he can

give up to a thousand, give up to a .thousand, but if he gives
more than a hundred, that has to be disclosed.

52
Our answer to that is disclosure serves two important
objectivest

one, which I think our opponents have recognized,

is that it deses serve an informing function, it tells the
electorate who is backing whom.

It shows who their friends are,

and this is an important element, because in making the choice,
when the electorate makes the choice? it should know who is
behind, whom in those cases,
Indeed, I just pos© a rather simple hypothetical:
suppose you have a key congressional race in which both candi­
dat®® are urging that they are dedicated to improving and
cleaning up the environment, and this is a keenly contested
tiling, each on© accuses the other of not being sympathetic to
the environment»
1 think it would foa highly significant to the voters
in this district if they knew that, a large number of officials
of several of the firms in this district that were accused of
being the leading polluters had all contributed to on© of the
candidates.

That would foe very significant*

How, let me add on© other thing on the hundred-dollar
amount,
QUESTIONt

Mr* Friedman, are you going to leave the

hypothetical you just put?

If you are about to leave it, I'd

like to ask this questions
As I understand it, corporations and unions are
exempted, from the spending and contribution requirements of

S3
this Act*
MR. FRIEDMAN*
it.

To the extent that Section SiO permits

That is. they have to have a separate independent fund

from which contributions are made*
All that this Act does is «*—
QUESTION*

Is there any limitation on that fund?

MR, FRIEDMAN*
th© separate fund.
QUESTION*

I don’t think so, once it gets into

But the «*That’s right.

And the union, and the

corporation, as th® case may be, has the authority under 610 to
organise that fund, and they solicit th© money for th© fund
from stockholders, employees, and union members.
Ho?, you're talking about th® corrosive or corroding
effect of large concentrations of wealth, how do you explain
the exemption of corporations and unions from this Act?

I

think the brief filed by your colleague, the Attorney General,
stated in a footnote on page 31 that in th® ■ 1974 congressional
elections, unions spent $4.3 million, corporations $1.6 million,
medical associations $1.5 million, and so on.
MR. FRIEDMANS Well, X —
QUESTION s What about '1*1108© concentrations of
corroding wealth?
MR. FRIEDMAN*

I’m not sure, Mr. Justice, that all

of those contributions would be permitted, because under this
Court’s decision in the Pipe Fitters case, the fund, the

54
independent fund, cannot be under the control ©£ either the
corporation or the union, it has to foe an independent fund.
And X don’t know how many of those contributions that were «*you referred to, would in fact foe permitted under this statute.
My other answer is that perhaps, perhaps at some
point Congress will feel it necessary to close and cut down on
the corporate and union contributions that are now permitted
under 610*

But that, it seems to me, is another matter.

That,

the fact that it’s permitted under that particular provision,
I don’t think is a reason for saying that Congress cannot act
under this statute as it has.
QUESTION:

X had understood, Mr* Friedman, maybe

mistakenly, that there was a difference of

opinion in the

briefs m to whether the limitations of the present statute would
extend to the kind of committees permitted under our Pipe
Fitters construction of Section 610»

whether or not they would be so-called "committees* under this

QUESTION:

Well# Mr, Friedman, before you go on, if

your answer to Justice Powell is right, it certainly stands
the cases of this Court on fee subject on their head, because
the thought had been that you could prohibit contributions

prohibit them from individuals * and now, if you* re right#
Congress comes along and says we*re prohibiting individual
contributions, but corporations and labor unions are free to
give what they want to,
MR, FRIEDMANs

But fee question is whether or not

fees® special funds have been locked in, if I may us© the phrase,

New# there is a provision saying that political
committees may give up to §5,000*

That applies not only to —»

if these funds# if these funds are political committees.

57

I’m not suggesting,. Mr. Justice, that Congress is
barrad in any way from imposing the limits upon corporations,
but the only question is whether Congress in this statute
whether Congress in ■axis statute has not tied the knot and
closed the ends as effectively as perhaps it might have*
I don't think «— X don’t think that Congress can foe faulted
because, in dealing with what it perceived as the general
problem of large corporations, it did not specifically say "and
no union fund or no corporation fund may ©3sca@d these
limitations«”
I think Congress left it somewhat unclear, because of
the question whether these funds would be committees.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but the history of our cases has been,

first, to sustain corporate limitations, with the thought that
you probably would have a great deal more difficulty with
individuals, and then to say, Well, you can treat unions the
same way you do corporations $ still intimating that you would
have a great deal more difficulty with individuals.

And now

you say Congress has com® along and stood the thing on its
head, that individuals are limited, but corporations and unions
aren’t.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Ho.

X*m sorry, Mr, Justice, perhaps

I misspoke myself, or didn’t make myself clear,
These provisions apply, not only to individuals, but feeunions and to corporations.

Congress has not said that corpora-

56
ticns and unions ar@ to be treated differently from individuals,
what Congress *****
QUESTION s

But the segregated funds are to be treated

differently.
MR* FRIEDMAN:

Perhaps.

Perhaps segregated funds.

But then, again, all that Congress -» all that has happened in
tills situation is that Congress has not gone as far as it might
have gone in this statute.
QUESTION:

Well, X gather, if what you suggested to

tpm earlier, namely, whether or not these segregated funds &r®

to be treated as political committees, there*s a question in
•the first instance to b© decided by the Commission; then, I take
it, %m don’t reach that question in this case for the purpose
of deciding the case her®,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think not, Mr» Justice, because

there has been, as far as 1 know, no ruling on that thus far.
QUESTION: Well, I think you suggested that there
couldn’t be, until after the Commission had, in the first
instance, decided whether or not these are committees.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

That is a difficult question of

exhaustion of remedies, that I would be reluctant to take a
position on, but X think the normal practice, the way the
Commission functions, is that if there were -a question# a
request would be made to the agency for an advisory opinion»

Mr* Friedman, X don't want to deter you

MR. FRIEDMAN*

I think there is» l*d have to say,

some doubt about that, because I don’t — let me say this, if
1 may, Mr* Justice, I don't think it's nearly as clear, it’s

nearly as clear as this statement in the amicus brief suggests,
that corporation© and unions, as a practical matter, may make
unlimited contributions in the course of campaigns through the
us® of these funds.
If X may return again «»«
QUESTIONS

If there*3 that much doubt among the

experts on this subject, I suppose some people will have to
act at their peril in deciding what to do, without being sure
whether they will or will not go to jail?

60

MR. FRISDMAN?

Ho, Mr* Chief Justice, they will not,

because under the statute, the statute explicitly provides that
anyone who is a candidat® for office can ask for an advisory
©pinion from the Federal Election Commission, which the
Commission is required to answer? and if he gets that ©pinion,
it's presumed

itrs presumed — that if h® acts in reliance

on this opinion, that he’s acted in accordance with the law.
So people are not left wholly at large to worry about it, they
can get mi advisory ruling, and the Commission has already given
20 or 30 advisory rulings on these topics.
So that there*s not in this case the danger of some­
body going to jail without being able to gat some advice? they
can get advice from the expert agency.
QUESTION;

But if he doesn't ask for the opinion,

and simply gets the ©pinion of his own lawyer, one way, and
that turns out to be wrong, he's got problems, hasn't he?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I would suppose, in much the same way

that anyone who is subject to a regulatory statute has problems
about whether or not he*s violated the statuta.
But, again, that's not a problem, it seems to m®r that
is faced in this case.

Because the time to really decide that

question, I would suppose, is if and when someone is charged
with having violated Hi© statute by making that kind of a
contribution.

Well, that's what they said.

MR* PRXEDM&Ns

I think that the -*» the c&sm in which

this Court has struck down disclosure requirements are cases in
which on© of two things have happened:

either there's been a

clear evidence that disclosure will produc® harassment or chill,
such as in soraa of th© NA&CP cases, in NM.CF u. Alabama, where
they put in uncontroverbed evidence with respect to th© adverse
effects that resulted in this
QUESTION5

I'm talking shout the Socialist Worker

Party case.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, again — well, now, let me coin©

to th© other, to th© other aspect of the equation:

all cases

in which there is no shewing of any substantial compelling
State interest.
Now, th© record in this case, as th© Court of Appeals
said, was slim.

With respect to the possible harassment of

disclosure# there were three minor instances in which there was

62

a slight suggestion — in opposition to that# five representa­
tives of minority parties indicated that as far as they could
tell there was no indication# either that people would refuse
to contribute if they were disclosed# or that anyone whoa©
disclosure had been made public# whose contribution had been
disclosed# was in fact subject to any harassment.
Mow# these minority parties play aa important role.
They can affect the influence of an election by drawing votes
sway from ©n-a to the other.
At page 179# in footnote 210# ©f this falu® brief
filed by the Center for Public Financing of Elections and others#
they give three indications# three examples of the so-called
wstalking-horse" phenomena# in which a political party sponsors
a minority candidata in the hope of drawing votes away from
the opponent.
N

How# there’s another ■—
QUESTIONs

Pardon me# Mr. Friedman# it*s in that

brief that l*ve now located the footnote to which X earlier
referred, footnote 124 on page 107# and the accompanying text.
That takes issue with the government's amicus brief on pagas
36 and 37 and the accompanying footnotes.
MR. FRIEDMANs Thank you.
One other thing about these disclosure provisions#
which X think is very important to remember.

On its face#

on® might say# Well# who cares about $100 contribution?

$100

63
contribution is not going to corrupt anyone , and why set the
limit this low?
The answer* I think, is twofold?
First, this is a very useful method for enforcing the
statute, because -■» and particularly where the over-all limit
is $1,000 —* a contribution of $100 cannot be said to b®
insubstantial*
But squally, or perhaps more important is the problem
©f culminating, of combining contributions, if you have a large
number of people who are affiliated, who do combine eentrifeu*tions«
Again, in this blue brief, on page 174, an example is
cited how a Senator on on® day in his senatorial campaign
received 247 individual contributions totalling $28,000 from
the employees of on© single corporation.
Now, that, it seems to me, is the .kind of information
that is very useful to the electors.

They like to know if a

large group of affiliated people have a sufficient community
of interest that they all favor a candidate.

That is again the

same kind ©f tiling as the general disclosure of who is backing
the candidate.

That is the sort of information that people

would like to have.
This “*« these —
QUESTION; And yet, Mr» Friedman, could that•corpora­
tion have set up a segregated fund and solicited or set up a

64
desk in the front office# and said that anyone that wants to
can contributa and 247 cam© along# made contributions totalling
$28#025? and then under the Attorney General*s suggestion# I
g@th.er that could have been spent by that fund any way they
wanted# without any disclosure of the names of those 247,
MR, FRIEDMANs

If# in fact — if the amicus brief,

is correct that this is not a political committee,

But# again#

Mr, Justice# 1 think tha answer is that perhaps — perhaps —
if it should turn out — if it should turn out that this device
cf the contributions by independent funds is another technique
that has been used to evade these statutory provisions# as we
had these mobile committees in the past# Congress may at soma
future data sea fit# one® again, to amend the Federal Election
Campaign laws# to close that loophole if it proves to be a loop»
hoi©,
But our point is —* our point is that the present
statute# the present statute# is a reasonable effort made by
Congress to deal with this problem# and that# while we think
there is very little if any chilling effect# to whatever extent
there may be some slight chill# we think that is more than off­
set by the vary strong compelling governmental interest in
trying to protect the integrity of federal ©lections# a
compelling interest which if© think# under the decisions of this
Court# justifies any possibly slight chilling affect that
these provisions may have upon the exercise of that most funds-

65

mental of all our rights, the right to vote.
QUESTION$

Mr, Friedman, necessarily# because ©f the

massiveness and the detail of legislation before us# the
arguments so far have been regrettably# but inevitably# 1
suppos©# imprecise and unfocused — made raore so# perhaps# from
the questions from the Bench — by the questions from the
Bench,
But# in an unfocused and generalised way# may I ask
you this;

Is it any part of the hypothesis or premis® behind

this legislation that the contributions or expenditures of vast
amounts of money would tend to represent a particular political
point ©f view?
MR, FRIEDMANt

I don’t believe so# Mr, Justice,

I

think the theory is that — and the record indicates that
large contributions have bean made on both sidas of the aisle,
I think Congress was not concerned that the large contributions
were favoring one aid© or the other#
QUESTION»
MR, FRIEDMAN s

That was ray understanding,
Congress is concerned that the large

contributions- war® having a corrupting effect on the electoral
process,
QUESTION: Well# now# how does that ~~ if your answer
is correct# and that’s ray understanding as well# I should say#
doesn’t this just reflect the — doesn't free spending no more
than reflect the basic philosophy of the First Amendment# which

se
is the constitutional provision with which we're here most
concerned, that if you have free spending, it's like free
speech, it tends to equalize out and the truth ©merges.
MR. FRIEDMANs

Well, Mr, Justice, I would say that

this is —• to us this is not speech, this is money? money
obviously called is important in connection with speech, but
it seems to me what Congress was concerned with her© was not
with attempting to, in any way, limit total speadh, limit
conduct.
Congress was conearned her® with the effect, the
effect that these larg© contributions, no matter what the
political persuasion of the recipient, with the effect these
largo contributions would have upon the whole process. And I
think Congress, as this Court's decisions have made clear,
going way back to Burroughs and Cannon in 1934, congress has
the power — Congress has the power to deal — to deal with
the corruption that results from this infusion of money.
And 1 don't think that Congress was attempting to say
that, Weill, there’s too much speech her®, and what we're going
to do is cut down the amount of speech.

Congress was saying,

There's too much money being spent, and the money has bad
effects, and we're going to try to cut down the amount of
money..
Now, to some extent, to be sure, to soma extent,
cutting down the money is going to cut down on the volume,

67
necessarily), of speech; but it seems to me this is an incidental
effect.

rights is overridden by the compelling government interests.

thereof.
MR. FRIEDMAN; We do not question y- we do not question
that there is a First Amendment protection to these interests.

what we deem to b© the clearly compelling government interest

Mr. Cox will, 1 'think,

will be discussing that.
QUESTION; Very good,
QUESTIONs

Mr. Friedman, in your peroration just

before you were questioned by tm brothers Stewart and Brennan,
you said that you thought the chilling effect her© was justified
fay th® interest in the most fundamental of all our rights, the
right to.vote.
Is it your position that the united States Constitu­
tion places the right to vote in a position superior to the
right to speak or publish?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

No, I don’t, I don’t, of course not,

Mr. Justice, but what I was suggesting is that this Court in a
number of its decisions lies recognised the key role that
©lections play in our democracy, and that what I was suggesting
was that what Congress was doing in this statute was attempting
to protect the integrity of that right, to protect the integrity
of th© whole electoral process»

QUESTIONg

Mr* Friedman, if I may break in, waste some

more time, following through ©n what Justice Stewart indicated,
it sees» to me, in a distinct sense, that on© of your problems
is to joust with Mils suggestion that money is speech.

And I

think part of the argument of your opponents is very forceful
in that respect, that it does produce speech.
Hew, all of us, of course, recognise that there is a
profound and disturbing problem feat has existed,

1 suppos®

the question is, What are we going to do about it?

And does

tliis statute do it effectively without unduly violating the
First Amendment?
MR, FRIEDMANs

W® feink the statute does, at least

■we think Congress is attempting to da it,

I would suggest,

Mr» Justice, that when you’re dealing with restraints upon
First Amendment rights, you have a spectrum, you have the
immediate prohibition that someone cannot speak, cannot
publish, then you begin to shift over. And it seems to me, as
the impact upon First Amendment rights becomes less direct and
more incidental, you can give greater weight, I would think, to
the compelling interests of the State in imposing those limita­
tions »
QUESTION: Well, I just wanted to emphasise that I
think it’s unnecessary, really, for your side of the case, to
impress upon -this Court that there is a problem,
are aware of this on©.

MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. COX*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ*,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR* COXs

Mr* Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
Although I come late in the argument, X cannot resist
saying just a word in recognition ©f the importance and weight
of the responsibility that rests upon this Court in this case.
Judging the constitutionality of a statute even when
there are fewer issues, and less complicated issues than there
are here, is always a solemn occasion.

But here the issues

are of oven greater magnitude, indeed, of a magnitude greater
then those in any federal legislation I can think of in several
decades, except perhaps the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960*8.
And certainly non© g© any closer to the heart of our
political and governmental system.
The attack, I would emphasis®, is leveled not only at
the conclusions of the Congress and the President of the United
States, but in substance it’s leveled at the conclusions of a
majority of the State Legislatures, and we must take it that
much ©f this represents the conclusions of their people.
The 44 States that have disclosure statutes, in one
form or another; there are 37 States that put limits on

72
expenditures, many of them going back a number of decades ? and
there are 10 States that have adopted public financing»

So that in addition to the weight of the judgment of
the Congress and 'the President who signed the legislation,,
there is this added problem of the State Legislatures.
How» ©f course, if it's the Court's responsibility to
hold the Act unconstitutional, it will do it, as this Court
always has? but I submit that those are considerations that
should b© weighed in the balance»
My argument is directed to the proposition that the
ceilings upon contributions and expenditures are consistent with
the First and Fifth Amendments, both as enacted on the face of
•the statute and as applied t© any situation ripe for adjudica­
tion ,
It's important at Cue outset t© b@ clear about
exactly what the ceilings on contributions and expenditures do
Sind do not do»

The Act deals with conduct, the giving and

©pending ©f money»
The conduct is speech related, I acknowledge, end,
indeed, emphasize,. because money buys the facilities of mass
communications, and limiting the money available for political
campaigns arax.table for spending may, ©f course, to some degree,
reduce the amount that is spent for mass communi cation»
But, ©van so, the conduct is speech related»
emphasise -that it is conduct and not speech»

I

73
The FECA does not prohibit# punish, or attach
liability to any utterance, communication, or publication,
except in. the vary limited sons® that in the case of expendi­
tures on© may have to look at the publication to sea whether it
urges th® election or defeat of a candidate.

So it will be

evidence as to purpose, but in no other sense.
QUESTION:

That would fo@ only under —

MR. COX:

603(e).

QUESTION:

*“*■* 608(e), would it not?

MR. COXs

That’s correct, Mr. Justice.

But there’s no attempt under 608(e) or anywhere ©Is©
to censor, directly or indirectly, the ideas expressed or the
verbal or pictorial form of communication.
Squally important, the public injuries at which the
Act is directed are the consequences not ©f speech but ©f
conduct.

Congress was not saying that ‘there is too much speech,

that dangerous thoughts were being expressed, or that the wrong
people were expressing th@m, or that they were expressing them
in dangerous ways.
Congress was concerned with whafe we may call the
arms race in political expenditures, with the pressure to raise
vast financial resources, the corrosive influence of obligations
to

big contributor's upon .the conduct of government, with the

loss of public confidence in the honor and integrity of
government, when money spent plays too big a role; and with

74
the political inequalities resulting not from the volume of
speech but from the need to raise money and indebtedness to
those who provide big money»
And I think these two characteristics of the statute
fix the applicable First Amendment principle, although I do not
suggest for a moment that they render the First Amendment
irrelevant.
When the government attempts to deal with speech
directly, then £h@ case for regulation has to be mad®, wholly
or in part, at least, in terms of the danger of the consequences
of the ideas.
Mills v. Alabama is a very good ©scampi®.

Now, the

Alabama statute forbad® last-minute newspaper editorials on
election day.

The only conceivable justification was that the

ideas expressed would somehow have too much impact upon the
public.
And it was quite right for the Court to reply as it
did in that case.

No test of reasonableness can save 'such' a

State law.
The reason is that censorship, concern for the ideas
expressed, may suppress the information or criticism essential
to self government? it carries danger of discrimination among
ideas or speakers, and :f,.as sometimes been said it carries the
seeds of an official ideology.
And, of course, in such cases# there is little or

75
perhaps no room for balancing, because the vary purpose of the
First Amendment, as James Madison said, is to withhold the
censorial power from government and retain it in the people.
The cases that illustrate this proposition are 'the
case of the Pentagon Papers # Haw York Times v. Sullivan, Miami
Herald v. Tornillo, and the Red Lion Broadcasting case.
I want to make it plain that we are not quarreling
with those cases# and we have no need to invoke any of them in
our support.
Cases Xik© the present, which involve the regulation
of speech related conduct, because of the public injury done by
the conduct, quite apart from the speech, calls for an entirely
different standard.

Such a law carries few if any of the

peculiar risks of censorship.

It does not suppress criticism#

ideas, or information? it risks no discrimination? it carries
no seeds of official ideology.
Balancing in such cases is appropriate# and has often
been sustained by the Court,
admirable example.

Branzburg v. Hayes is an

There the conduct# the duty to testify, was

of grave public importance# just as giving

evidence by all of

us is of grave public importance.
It was our view that regulating the conduct imposing
that, duty would tend to chill or deter the flow of information
to the public.

Both the opinion of the Court and the principal

dissenting opinion# as I read them# agreed that the test was

76
whether the consequential effect upon the flow of speech was
justified by the public interest served by imposing the duty to
testify.
The draft-card burning case, United States v. O’Brien,
is another example.

After observing that the possession of the

draft card contributed to the effective administration of the
Selective Service laws, the Court observed:

The case at bar

is therefore unlike one where the alleged governmental interest
in regulating conduct arises in som® messuro because the
communication is itself thought to be harmful.
And the Court will recall 'that it wont on to speak of
the need for balancing and to hold that the public purposes, if
compelling or paramount, were sufficient to justify the purely
consequential and, in that sense, coincidental impact upon
speech«.
1 hold this point so important that X want to take
one last example to elaborate it.
The appellants' and the Solicitor General assert that
limiting the money spent to publish a newspaper would violate
the First Amendment, and they liken this case to the case of
the newspaper.
I submit that they both speak too indiscriminately.
A limitation on the publisher’s expenditures would violate the
First Amendment if it rested upon som© notion that the columns
were too long, the editorials were too frequent, the circulation

77
was too wide, there war© too many editions, or something of that
kind*
But consider, during a. wartime shortage Congress
certainly could limit the money that could be spent to buy
newsprint, even though the consequence.was to reduce the circula­
tion of the paper or the number of editions —
QUESTIONs

But, Mr. Cox, it would have to limit it

even-handedly, wouldn't it?
MR. COXs

It couldn’t —

Oh, ye®.

But wa say this

statute does

limit even~handedly.
QUESTIONS

Well, but it limits the amount of money

that can b@ spent on political contributions or, on 608(e),
the amount that can be spent for individual expressions in
support of a candidate, but it doesn’t limit any other kind of
expenditures•
MR* COXs

I would have to agr€i@ that because th®

dangers that the statute is directed to operate in the area of
political campaigns, th® only speech that is consequentially
affected is political speech.

I can't dispute that.

I would certainly • say that, that again was not based
i

on a congressional judgment, as to something desirable ©r
undesirable about political speech? and certainly contain no
kind of discrimination between different political ideas or
parties or candidates.
QUESTIONs Well, it does limit only a certain kind of

78
political speech.

Now, whether ©r not 'that may be helpful

That’s correct.

QUESTION; Well, all right.
MR, COX;

And I think 'that it do@s, in a very real

sens©, help us out.
But I would say that this kind of discrimination.
Justice Relinquish, is coincidental or consequential, and it
is not fcha sort of selectivity or undesirability that would
be enough to make a differant test applicable.
QUESTION;

Mr. Cox, could the limits, that is, the

disclosure limit, the §100 limit, th© $1,000 limit, the
expenditure limit, could they be so low or if -they were cast
so low, do you agree that they might then impinge on First
Amendment rights?
MR. COX:

I would.

I would agree to two things:

that if they are set so low as really not to allow any use of

79
the mass media, or ‘that that would present a very different
case tiian the one here,
l would agree, too, that if they were set vary, vary
low e they might than discriminate against challengers to
But, on both points# I submit# Mr« Chief Justice#

incumbents*

that the record is very clear that that is not th© consequence
of this statute»
In terms of the expenditure ceilings# it is quit®
clear# and. th© figures are all in our brief, that the ceilings
are very close to those which have governed in political
campaigns in th© past»
For example# in 1972 and 1974# lumping th© whole
2,000 candidates for the House together, 97 percent spent less
than the ceiling.

There's no suggestion 'that there was

inadequate speech in those 97 percent ©£ the campaigns.

Or

even in the case of presidential ©lections, th© figure set is
very close to the average amount spent by the two candidates in
1968.

Oh# it's a little bit below' the amount spent by

Senator McGovern in 1972* it is way below the amount spent by
his opponent»
But it’s higher than was spent in any previous
campaign.

So that we say that it is so closely r@le.ted to what

took place in the past, that one has to conclude that Congress
had a solid basis for judging that this would not seriously
curtail the volume of political speech»

QUESTION:

I want to be sure that 1 understand your

answer to the chief Justice*» question-

You said that you would

MR. COX:

MR, COX:

No.

I think the change in balance, if any,

is on the justification, not on the* invasion.
record shows, there’s vary little

S© far as this

there’s no showing of

any deterrent effect ©f disclosure.
QUESTION:

; So, in brief, you're -~

MR. COX:

And these laws have been on the books for

a vary long time.

Of course, if one can contribute, especially
/

if it’s a group of corporata executives that are contributing,
they would rather contributa before the disclosure law becomes
effective than after.

But, as one of the Justices pointed out,

that doesn't show they wouldn’t contribute after.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Cox, as I understood you, you expressed

the view» that a challenger is not disadvantaged by this Act,
May I put this hypothetical to you:
Suppose the challenger is in a district from which

82

the Member of Congress —- which the Member of Congress has
served, savf for ten or fifteen years, and therefore is very
wall known.
assume further that the entire media in that district
supports the incumbent.
Would you think he would have much of a chance?

I

realise it would depend on the facts and circumstances, but
isn’t he disadvantaged?
MR. COX;

X was — X was speaking, Justice Powal1,

in terms ©f the general impact.

I will agree that you can

think of cases wham the only way in which a man could win was
by having to spend enormous sum» of money himself, because
every tiling ©is© was stacked against him.
And X was thinking of the generality.

X got into it

by attempting to grant to the Chief Justice# in answer to the
Chief Justice’s question, that if the over-all limit on
spending ware very, very lew, then the man who has recognition
to begin with, of course, would have an advantage.
The point X was seeking to make was that the ceilings
here at not that low.

.And X 'think that again is shown by

experience, and of course the burden ©£ showing isn*t on those
defending the statute; it’s on those attacking it.
But if you look at the ceilings, on -the basis of the
1974 election, it. seems that they give ample chance to
challengers to gain recognition; and, second, that taking the

83
Act as a whole, they hurt incumbents who probably have the
greater money-raising capacity, more than challengers.
Let me give just a few figures,
I pointed out a moment before that only three percent
of all th© candidates in the House races — it's a little less
than three percent — exceeded th© ceilings in 1972 and 1974,
even after 872 was adjusted for inflation.
Of the 40 successful challengers in 1974, only one
exceeded the calling.

Of th® 28 challenger winners in close

races, that is where th© winner got less than SS percent of th®
vote, the average spent was only $95,000 out of an over-all
ceiling of $168,000 for the combined primary and general
elections,
Of th© candidates in close races in both primary and
general ©lections in *74, only 4 of 59 exceeded the combined
ceiling.
So there really is very little ground for arguing
that these ceilings, which really check the skyrocketing in­
crease rather ‘than cut anything very much back, and particularly
in the congressional raccss, don't allow adaquate opportunity to
become known; and I can find no basis for arguing that on the
whole they fail — they discriminate against challengers,
I think, if they d© anything, they hurt incumbents
more than challengers,
QUESTION?

Mr, Cox, does the legislative history

84
show that ‘the kind of analysis you * vm just given us —MR. COX:

Did Congress what?

QUESTIONs Did Congress make the kind of analysis, in
fixing those* limits, -that you "vs just bean suggesting?
MR. COX;
QUESTION*
MR. COX;

I am not able to say that it did*
Except that —
1 think on® must assume that many members

of the staff, and others, did study these things, and I am
informed that —
QUESTION; Well, I just wondered whether the legis­
lative history revealed that kind of analysis.
MR, COX;

Perhaps I * 11 have a moment after lunch in

which I could answer your question, Justice Brennan,
QUESTION:

But at least Congress decided what the

limits were going to be.
MR. COX;
QUESTION;

Oh, ye®.

After considerable discussion.

It apparently thought that this would be

enough money for anybody to spend.
MR. COX;

And these were men. who had run in many,

many races, sometimes most recently as winners, but X have a©
doubt that many of -them sometimes lose.
QUESTION;

But the deferenc® that you might give to

a congressional judgment as to how much money might be appro­
priate may not be the same if, when we*re talking about how
much incumbents thought challengers- might need.

85
MR» COX8

Well# I. find it hard to believe that all

435 favor incumbents entirely*
2 r@cogn.ise »**»
QUESTIONS But your answer ■»MR, COX;

X recognise, too# that this is a First

Amendment case# and that the judgment perhaps requires a some­
what closer scrutinyi but 2 wouldn’t think 'that, the Court should
simply act as a legislative body# I — excuse me,
QUESTION? But your answer apparently is what you’ve
already given# that# based on history# -the incumbents won’t do
any better under this than challengers?
MR* COX* That is correct*

tod# indeed# 1 think that if

the history shows much either way# it shows that the incumbents
are hurt more, because they always# nearly always spend more#
both when they’re successful and unsuccessful*
tod this we draw from the figures on the close races*
QUESTION: Well# I take it# your answer gives some
weight to the fact -that incumbents have a lot of built-in
assets that challengers do not have? namely# large offie®
staffs and branch officos out in districts? and that sort of
thing?
MR, COX:
QUESTION:

I recognise that —
Plus the newsworthiness to what, they da#

that the challengers don’t always have**
MR, COX:

There’s no question but that incumbents

86

hav® advantages; sometimes there are disadvantages# but there
are likely# through name recognition# to be advantages»
My proposition is that this statute does not make the
challengers any worse off in that respect than they were before»
Now, seme have mellifluous voices and others don’t* there are
all kinds of injustices in the world,
X say this statute doesn’t make it any worse,

and

we have developed that at some length in our brief,
I would add to that# Mr, Chief Justice# that the
most that is contended is that on the average# as 1 understand
it# because the word ’’generally'1 is included in the heading in
the brief# that on the averages they contend# statistically#
somewhat more incumbents my benefit and challengers be hurt
than the other way around.
But# of course# on® doesn't make & case ©f unconstitu­
tional. discrimination by that kind of statistical average*
Furthermore# all it seems to me to say is that
challengers gain more from the pernicious practices than
incumbents # and we would say that the pernicious practices or
the evils Congress was meeting are such that they justify#
certainly# any chance differentiation between them*
QUESTIONs Well, then# 1 suppose you’d say that where
the whole area is foggy# then the line»drawing should b© left
to the Congress?

X would certainly say that, yes# sir.

AFTERNOON SESSION
[ls02 p.Sl. }'
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Cox.

ORAL ARGTO4ENT OF ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. COX:

- Resumed

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the Court:

Before the recess I had to confessi to Justice Brennan
my ignorance on on® point, but it’s new been relieved, Mr.
«Justice.
An analysis of the relationship between possible
spending ceilings and past experience, based, of course, on
*72 rather than ’74, because ’74 hadn’t happened, was submitted
to the congressional committees, chiefly by common cause, and
it whs essentially the same kind ©f analysis that I mad©.
If you care for the references, you will find it in
the hearings on H„ R. 7612, 33rd Congress, First Session, which
was in October and November 1573? and similarly the hearings on
S. 1103, at the sums Congress and the same Session.
At that time, I may say, and then I’d like to go on.

88

the common cause representatives were arguing that cara must be
taken not to set the ceilings too low.

And the quotations that

my friends refer to, complaining that if the ceiling was too
low, it would discriminate against challengers, was during a
time when much lower ceilings were being discussed than appear
in this statute»
Now, 1 would like, during the moments remaining to
me, t© address myself to Section 608(e) of the statute, which
has been mentioned several times this morning.

That is the

section which deals with the so-called independent expenditures.
If an expenditure -- a spending of money, in the loos©
sens® «“ is requested by a candidate ©r his committes, or is
otherwise made with his authority, then it’s a contribution and
counts against his over-all ceiling*
If the spending is done without any kind ©£ authority
from the candidate, then it fails under Section 608(e)t and
if it exceeds $1,000, it would be unlawful.
To put the discussion of that section in context,
may X first recall portions that I will have to leave to my
brief, having stated, as w® did, the applicable constitutional
principle this morning, then, of course, a complete exposition
would call, first, for showings I did seek to show, that
adequate opportunities for speech remained? second, that the
purposes of this legislation were, indeed, compelling.
The purposes, as we see them, ares

first, t© protect

69
the honor and integrity of government operations in both the
Legislative and Executive Branches against the corrosive influ­
ence of large contributions, the pressure to raise larga money,
and the resulting sense of indebtedness — which of course does
not affect every contribution# but there appear to have been
toe many of that character.
Its oonceaa with the public confidence in its govern­
ment against the appearance of things.

When government favors

follow such larga contributions»
3nd its concern with giving fch® small donor an equal
voice with tii© large donor — not in speaking# but in opportun' ity to reach the candidate, the large donor of money.
Now# w@ say that Section 608(a)# the limit on
independent enpenditures # is essential to the effectuation of
those purposes.
Well# very briefly# if there were no such provision
in the statute# then# instead of making a contribution ©£ 5# 10
or 50 thousand dollars# someone would just spend it? take over
all the candidate's advertising in Lawrence# Massachusetts? ©r
take over the broadcasting of film clips ©£ his previous
speeches or his television spots.
And surely# in this aspect of 603(e)# it’s essentially
like a contribution# it’s money that the person who spends it
is putting out? he's not putting out his own words or his own
ideas# he's not engaged in personal activities.

90
QUESTIONS Well? Mr# Cox, I notice that distinction
in your brief# too#

How about the ad that was bought in New

York Times.v. Sullivan» would that b© under your definition of
personal activity, or would that just b® money?
MR# COXs

2 think the ad in — of course# that isn't

in support of a candidate.

And I'm suggesting that there is something of a

line*

I think these eases shade indistinAnd I cannot draw an intelligible

Indeed* icy essential proposition is that an intelligible

line cannot be drawn, and that the reason Congress included
608(e) as it did was that it decided that the most sensible
line was between personal participation in campaigning or in
speaking* in doing things yourself* in personal services * end
spending money*
And it drew the line there because there was

bo

other

very satisfactory way of doing it.
QUESTION s

But if they could -« if there is n©

analysis* they could equally well have forbidden the expenditur®

MR» GOX:

No -« well* I think where it is truly

personal services, that is distinguishable from spending money*
QUESTION:

Then you do make something turn on the

92
pointy then.
MR., COX;

X make something turn between truly

personal services and speaking, and putting up money»

X agree

that they shad® on© into the other, and that the question is;
where is the most satisfactory place to draw a line?
And I suggest that the most satisfactory place to
draw the line, which Congress considered very carefully, was
between allowing people to do tilings themselves and allowing
and seeking to spend more than $1,000, also really more than
$1500f because you get $500 in incidental expanses if you do
it yourself* But X'™«

MR, COX;

I would make, if I may., just two further

broadcasting their own speeches, or putting their own writings
in newspapers*

Mid second, the reason I emphasise ray agreement with
the proposition that the line can hardly foe drawn between
personal involvement in a paid advertisement and no real personal
involvement in the paid advertisement, the reason I stress that
is that theaje it .-shows

the important of section 608(e) to the

who I© plan, that this would foe, as the court below recognized,
an exceedingly serious loophole.
I don’t think it. would render th© whole plan
inoperable.

But it would be an exceedingly serious loophole.

It would raise the whole pressure over again.
But X express just ©ns last thought on this point, Mr.
Chief Justice#
X point out that there is no plaintiff her© who
alleges that he or she desires to spend money publicizing
his or her own speech, and 'that this most extreme application
of 608(e) might wall be treated as hypothetical and not
properly before the Court, and the argument of overbreadth
could, and I think should, be rejected on the ground that
through most of its application, Section 600(a) is like the
restriction on contributions, and that, therefore, the doctrine
©f overbreadth doesn’t apply, and the particular cases can be
dealt with if and when they ever arise.

Mr, Winter,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH K, WINTER, JR,, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, WINTER:

Mr, Chief Justice* may it pleas® the

Courts
Let as© just briefly clear up on® apparant point of
confusion*

Volume I of our Appendix, page 39, it is alleged

that Stewart Mott desires to make independent expenditures

cm

behalf of candidates in excess of $1,000, and the other
candidates who are plaintiffs, appellants here, make allegations
that they wish to have people make such expenditures on their
behalf.
Let me also address to© question of the meaning of
Section 610 and the segregated funds,

1 must confess that we

ss@ vagueness there, as elsewhere, and we are not able to
endorse the Attorney General's flat position that unions and
corporations may spend unlimited amounts from segregated funds.
1' don't think*, in any sens®, that ©van if it is read
to mean that they must spend through six-month political
committees, the statute still gives them relatively far more
Power than they had previously.

They are permitted: — first,

98
under Pip® Fitters, the unions and the corporations clearly
control the disbursal of the funds.

That’s the explicit language

of Mr. Justice Brennan’s decision# I believe it was# is that
w® hold — at page 384t

We hold that such a fund must be

separat® from the sponsoring union only in the sens® that there
must fo© strict segregation of its moneys from union dues and
assessments*
And I taka it that continues now, otherwise it would
violate -- if the union or corporation did not control the
funds, it would violate the prohibition on earmarking.

S© that

they do control the fund.
Mow, they ©rs permitted —

Mr* Winter, —
Y©£, sir?

to unions and corporations, on the number of committees that
a union or a corporation could organis©?
MRa WINTERS

We see nothing in the statute, Your

Honor.

MR. WINTER?

None in the Pipe Fitters, is there?
No.

QUESTIONS-

You could probably have a committee at

99

the minimum fer each subsidiary corporation and each local
union.
MR. WINTER;
Yes*

X would certainly think that’s true.

And where you have interests» like the dairy interests,

on a county basis, that can be don® horizontally across the

country.
Thera are three reasons why unions and corporations
have great power under tills statute relative to other groups,
The first is that 'they can engage in unlimited spending, to
raise money for the segregated fund®.

As far as we can tell

from the statute, they are permitted to spend as much as they
want from their treasuries to raise the money from members,
employees, and stockholders.
Second, they can spend unlimited funds to communicate
with employees, members, and stockholders; and this is alleged,
or is believed to be of great value, because communications
with those people necessarily reach large numbers of other
voters.
QUESTION;
argument?

How does this fit into your constitutional

You say 'that corporations and unions hav© great

power; but that, by itself, does not demonstrate the statute is
unconstitutional.
MR. WINTER;

I think it does, and that fits in two

ways *
Oiks, X think it’s a facial discrimination and a

/

10D
regulation of content.

Hera w® have almost exactly the

situation faced by th® Court in Moslay, where there is a general
prohibition on a certain kind of an activity -» of speech , with
sin exception made for labor organizations.
Secondly, Justice Rehnquist, I think it shows beyond
any question that there’s no rational relationship between the
ends that are used to justify this statute and the means
employed.
This record, this Appendix is thick with contributions
by business and union interests, which th© statute is alleged
to diminish, whose influence th® statute was supposed to stop?
and, indeed, the allegation is made, ovmr and over again, that
the prime source ©£ corruption or improper obligation comes
from organised economic interest groups,
v

I think If w® can show that in fact under this
statute — and 1 think we have shown convincingly •»- that under
this statute that those groups have more power, relatively
more power, because of the limitation placed on other

groups

and the freedom loft to them, 1 think w© have shown its
unconstitutional! ty „
The third way in which they are made relatively inora
powerful is that the six-month political committee provision
is really tailored to their use for purposes I've explained
before, and allows them to spend five times as much as other
kinds of committees and individuals

101
There Is nothing anywhere that I know of in the
legislative history of this statute suggesting in any way that
any justification for those provisions, that have fee do with
the asserted justifications for the statute.
New, reference has been made to the legislative
history of the limits.

I think when the Court addresses the

legislative history, it will find that It5a quite simple.
They kept going down.
QUESTION s
MR, WINTERS

They kept doing what?
They kept going down.

From the

original proposals, they got lower and lower, and, indeed,
w* are in souse disagreement with Mr, Cos;*© description ©f the

situation in, I believe it was, November 1973, when common
cause testified before Congress,

I am reading from Mr. Gardner*© testimony.
passed

The bill

the Sanate would allow candidates for the Rouse to

spend $90,000 in primary races and another 90,000 in feh©
general election *
Some have advocated expenditure limits substantially
lower than those contained in that bill, 35,000; 42,500', 50,000
are among the figuras which have been mentioned as preferable.

Common cause considers that any substantial reduction
of the figures in S, 372, which was 90,000 in both elections,
would virtually guarantee: permanent reelection of incumbent
Members of Congress.

102
Now* of course, they did reduce the limits after that,
%

and, in fact, if one adjusts for inflation, tit© limits of the
Senate bill at that time were $100,800 for each election, so
that, there was a very substantial reduction after that»
The legislative history in the Senate;

repeatedly

the floor managers and the lik© in the Senate stated that the
House could writ® their ticket, that the Sanate ought not
review what the Hons© was doing.
Mew, I think it’s clear in our brief what our objec­
tions to their statistical figures, and in particular the
comparison with th© over-all ce*shined limit, in that the
statute in no way permits candidates to aggregate.

You have

to spend to influence a particular election, and comparing
previous spending with an over-all combined limit «- comparing
that with previous spending by candidates who had one serious
race, ©imply does not make any sense.
,

1 might also say, suppose it doesn't hurt challengers,

suppose it is as even-handed? no on© really denies that it’s
not going to affect th© outcome of elections.

No one really

claims that this isn’t going to have an impact, indeed, the
whole reason was to reduce the amount of political speech in
which people were engaging.
Now, it seems to me that clearly it will affect the
outcome of ©lections, it doesn’t matter who is affected, it
is still a First Amendment problem.

The public will suffer,

because it is exposed to less and less information, less and
less debate? there will be less participatory activity by
volunteers and the like*
Virtually all the evils 'that, have been suggested in
this Court in no real sens© call for limitations on candidate
expenditures*

lb,® ones we have now# because it cost so much

to raise large contributions# really induce candidates to try
and raise contributions in as high an amount as they possibly
can# because they save that much on fund raising*
Also# there*s no reason# certainly# to limit campaigns
*— the amount campaigns can spend# whether or not they ar@
raising it in large contributions,
This statute limits — would have put limits on the
campaign of a candidate like Ramsey Clark# who has announced
that he -- who did announce that he would not spend over —
would not receive contributions over $100*
Now# X haven’t heard anything today which would call
for limits on expenditures# extraordinary spending provisions
for State and National Party Committees# distinctions between
kinds of committees which permit greater freedom to some than
ethers,

And# indead# X would think that if Congress were

serious about what it was claiming it was doing# or if it had
T

sat and considered a far simple,t law# it might have had a better
solution? not just a better one# but ©ns more constitutional*
A law that restricted total contributions of individuals

104
to candidates or committees, to, say, something like a total of
$35,000 in an election year, and adequate disclosure provisions
for timely notice of large contributions, would prevent
corruption# bring about equality, at least as much as the FECA,
and yet would not have the same stringent impact on challengers
to incumbents or other candidates.
We don’t say it’s constitutional# but of all the
major constitutional issues in this Court# all but on© disappear
with a law of that kind.
Nothing' demonstrated in Congress or in the record
her© calls for either the complexities or tee intrusiveneas
of the FECA»
The appellees and amicus attack us- for the extent
of our challenge# but 'this complex network of intricate dis­
tinctions is wholly unrelated to the purposes of the- statute
and itself is a signal that more loopholes# more inequalities
ar© being created.
I think that 608(e) demonstrates the intrusiveness
©f this law.

Th© idea that a law putting almost a flat ban on

the purchase of political advertising by individuals can be
called a loophole closing provision

is not only contrary to

th© major thrust of this Court’s decisions for years# but
demonstrates just how intrusive this statute is on the fra©
political debate in this country.

Mr. Clagett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRICE M. CLAGETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CLAGETTs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
Appellants * position is, first, that any mechanism
for direct federal funding of political partias and candidates
is unconstitutional; and, second, that the particular mechanism
Congress has chosen, embraces a number of unconstitutional
discriminations among particular candidates and parties.
With tiie CourtJs indulgence, I will reverse the order
of our brief, and discuss the second question first.
I begin with Chapter 95, which provides for general
election federal subsidies for some but not all presidential
candidates.
The basic device, of sours®, is the distinction
between major parties which won more than 25 percent ©f the
vote in the prior ©lection, minor parties which won between 5
and 25 parcant, and so-called "new" parties which either really
are new or else are old but won lass -than 5 percent at the
prior election.
Major party candidates are wholly relieved of the

Ill
need to seek private contributions*

They ara furnished their

entire expanditur® limit, $20 million,* at the outset; of the
campaign.
Minor parties, if there ara any,-*» which there won’t
be in 1976

receive a pro rata share dependent on the ratio

©£ their prior vote to the average vote of 'the major parties.
New parties receive nothing, but if they win over 5
percent of the vote in the currant election, they purportedly
can receive post-election funding? though we shall see that that
alleged entitlement is almost completely illusory.
Independent candidates, not identified with a party,
receive nothing at any stage, no matter what their vote,
A most serious problem with this scheme is the treat­
ment of new parties.

We think the 5 parcent threshold first,

although this isn’t the most serious objection, is too high.
It is much mor© onerous than the nominally similar threshold
sustained for ballot access in Jenness vs, Forison. because
that scheme allowed petitions signed by persons who, at the
prior election, had voted for other parties, since -this is
pure a prior vote qualification, it requires that the member
of the 5 percent not have voted for anyone ©Isa and not stay
at horns.
The Jenness Court relied heavily on the open aspects
of the 5 percent, that anyone could sign the petition, even if
he just voted, in a primary two weeks before that for another

112
party.

And in Jennass you upheld that 5 percent figure with

strong intimations that were it not for those open features
not present here, 5 percent would be too high.
QUESTIONS

Mr, Clagefctr I know this is not -*• I just

wanted to get thiss

If one, if a presidential candidate elect®

to take public funding financing, ha can’t talc® private
contributions, can he?
MR. CLAGETT;

Hot if he*a a major-party candidate,

Justice Brennan, than ha gets his full 20 million, and h@ has
to promise in advance that h@ won’t take any private contri­
butions .
QUESTION; And if any is contributed, what happens to
it?
MR. OLAGETT:

I think the practical answer would b®

that he would — he would know, he isn’t the major-party
candidate who qualifies until after the convention —
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. CLAGETT;

«•« and surely, by the time of the

convention or immediately thereafter, he’d make his decision,
which route he’s going.
If he's a minor-party candidate, he just has to
agree not to take any contributions that would put him over the
limit, and it’s his, in addition to whatever public funds he
gets.
QUESTION; What about primary expenses?

113
MR. CLAGETT:

Primary expenses, well, that's chapter

96, which I*d life® to deal with separately, if l my.
QUESTION:

All right.

Thank you,

QUESTION: That's matching funds, isn't it?
MR, CLAGETT:

That's matching funds, and the issues

are quite different»
QUESTION: Very different.
MR. CLAGETTs

The 5 parcent requirement involved in

this statute is very much. Ilk© the 5 percent requirement which
you were unable to accept in Sfcorer vs. Brown? very much like it*
functionally.
It's relevant her©, by the way, I think, that 42
States, for ballot access, have one percent or less as a petition
requirement.

The other side has relied for other purposes on

State practice, and the general State practice is that one
percent is about the maximum which is thought reasonable to
require on petitions for ballot access,
QUESTIONS That's just for ballot access?
MR, CLAGETTs
QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Stewart.

It has nothing to do with financing, as

such.
MR. CLAGETT:

Well, except to the extent that the two

factors may be comparable, by analysis.
QUESTION:

But I understand the Statas do publicly

finance their elections

114
MR. CL&GETTs
QUESTION s

Ten or fewer.

Yeso

MR» CIAGETT:

Yes, sir.

The roost egregious discrimination in Chapter 95 is
that no way is provided for new parties to qualify by petition
at all*

They are excluded entirely on the basis of prior vote

performance„
I want to make it clear again throughout I'll b@
v.

using BnewB- parties in the sense the statute does; the party
could be 100 years old and still be a 8new* party»
In view of the dead hand of the prior ejection in
wholly excluding new parties, the reliance of appallass and of
the court of Appeals , indeed, on Jennas» s vs» Forts on we think
is completely misplaced.

Because fee statute upheld in feat

cas® permitted a petition requirement, the 5 percent there was
a petitioned 5 percent, not a prior-vote 5 percent.
Indeed, every on® of fee ballot access cases involved
a petition alternative routs to get on fee ballot, instead of
being limited or excluded on the basis of prior-vote statistics.
Some of those means you have held too onerous, some
of them you have held reasonable.

But in every on© of the

cases there was a rout©; her© there is no rout®.

No way.

If a party, one year after the 1976 election or three years
after the 1976 election, comes into existence, there will be
no way it can receive prior — pre-election funding in the 1980

115
election.
Appellees have failed to suggest any reason whatever
why a qualification for federal funds by petition could not and
should not have been incorporated in Chapter 95,

Such a

readily available mechanism, while not solving all constitu­
tional problems, would have provided a new party with some means
to qualify.

It would have avoided the plain irrationality of

making eligibility for these subsidies depend entirely on fouryear-old ©lection statistics, when conditions may have been
totally different.
Post-election flanding, which this statute purports
to provide is no solution.

Obviously, funds provided after the

election is over are of no use whatever to a party in trying to
win the election or to make a substantial impact on it.
Moreover, if that weren't enough, this theoretical
entitlement to post-election funding is rendered almost com­
pletely illusory by the provision that it can be used only to
repay loans — which is what the statute says.

The result

will be that only a tiny fraction of a new party's expenditures,
if any, will fa@ reimbursable, even though the party otherwise
qualifies.
Mo reason has ever bean suggested, to our knowledge,
why

restriction could not have been omitted, and new

parties allowed to recover post-election funding if they qualify
for the five or some other percent, could recover subsidies

116
equivalent to the amount of their expenditures, not of their
expenditures made through loans? then they could have used that
money for their general party purposes or to prepare for the
next election»

They at least would have gotten something that

might do them some good in the future, even though it wouldn't
do them any good in the current election,
QUESTION:

Which of the appellants, Mr, Clagett, is

a "new* party, as defined in the statute?
MR* CLAGETT:

The Libertarian Party, the Conservative

Party of New York,
QUESTION;

How about the Republican Party of

Mississippi?
MR* CLAGETT:

No, sir, that is a part of the National

Republican Party, which is a major party*
[Laughter,]
MR, CLAGETT:

If we had congressional public financing,

it might well qualify, and the appellees are trying to get that
to them.
Senator Metcalf's amicus brief points out entirely
accurately that this incredible restriction, that you can only
get post-election funding to pay back loans that you’ve made —
that you've incurred, that this restriction penalises new
parties for having been able to raise contributions rather than
make expenditures on credit.
Whereas, for major parties, under Chapter 96, major-

117
party candidates at the primary stags are rewarded for getting
contributions.

It just makes no sense to us.

Unless the purpose

is discriminatory? certainly the result is.
This system, especially when coupled with the expendi­
ture and contribution limits, leaves new parties far worse off
than they are now.

They are declared unworthy ©f federal

funding, because of their modest support, but simultaneously
they are denied the right to try to increase that support by
seeking large contributions to pay for heightened campaign
activities.
In fact, in presidential general elections, since the
major parties are fully subsidised, the contribution limits
apply only to minor and new parties and independent candidates.
Only they must bear the burden of those limitations and incur
the large cost of trying to raise small contributions.
The contribution limits at the presidential election,
the general election stage, have no effect whatever on the major
parties„
QUESTION:

Well, would it cure your problems if the

minor parties or the new parties weren’t subject to the contri­
bution limits?
MR. CLAGETT:

No, Justice White, it would not.

We

think that ™~
QUESTION s

Nor the expenditure limit?

MR. CLAGETTz Well, the expenditure limits are a bit

1.18
academic as applied to minor parties# at least at the presiden­
tial level.
QUESTION:

But the contribution limits; --

MR, CLAGETTs The contribution limits are by no means
academic.

But even if minor parties were free to raise large

contributions# they would still have to raise money privately#
*

while -file major parties were being subsidised by the federal
government.

And we know ©f no rational basis for that dis­

crimination.

Certainly not at a five percent prior vet®

threshold level.

Possibly at a one percent current petition

;
\

threshold level# maybe.

And we*re not saying there’s no
r

threshold that might not be constitutionals, — excuse me# that
might b© constitutional.
Appelles* answer to all these discriminations is that
third parties and independents are benefitted by the expenditure
limitation# sine® they will now be able to spend more in
relation to major-party spending# but you can’t spend money if
you can’t raise it# and nobody gives it to you.
Even besides that# a major — a minor party is not
concerned with %/hat a major party spends.

Its sol® interest is

*

being able to raise and spend# itself# enough to wage a viable
campaign.

Thus# for someone like the appellant Libertarian

Party# I can assure you that it doss not feel fortunate because
the Democrats and Republicans are now limited to $20 million
each# when it is cut off from every reasonable source of funds

119
to wage any kind of campaign that could get itself better known
and maybe gradually, over a process of years, make some progress
towards becoming a major party — which is, of course, its aim,
QUESTIONS

You mean to say that a party of the kind

you’ve just described is waging an issue campaign, without any
real hope of electing its candidate, necessarily?
MR» CLAGETTs

I do not believe the Libertarian

candidate for President this year ...'believes he will be elected»
But. it's not only an issue campaign.,

I think any party of this

nature will be looking ahead, down the road, to future elections»
Maybe eight years from now, maybe twelve years from now»
That’s a party ©f the kind of fch® Libertarian Party’s
nature.

Now, there are other kinds of third parties, which

would be also new parties under this statuta»
The American Independent Party would have been a new
party in 1968, and would have been completely shut out. from
campaign financing.
QUESTION: Would the Republican Party, under this
statute, have been a new party in I860, when Abraham Lincoln
first ran?
MR. CLAGETTs

Ho, sir.

It would have been a new

party in 1856, and that’s when it would have had its throat,
cut.
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:

Then they would never have gotten to 1860,

120

in your submission?
HR. CLAGETTs

Precisely.

Precisely»

one bizarre result of this statute is that if a third
party ever does manage to qualify for federal fundss its life
will be unnaturally and artificially prolonged.

If these

provisions had bean in effect in 1972* John Schmitz would have
received more than $6 million in federal general election sub­
sidies on th© basis of Georg® Wallace’s election-day performance
in 1968.
QUESTIONS Th© other side of that coin* of course* is
that Governor Wallace made a lot of noise end was heard four
years before.
MR. CLAGETTs

Yes, sir.

But third parties typically

arise, we -think, and George Wallace’s I960 candidacy is maybe
not wholly typical, but it’s not wholly atypical, either.
They typically arise either t© give some outlet to a
transient wave of popular sentiment, or as the vehicle of a
particular candidate, which was certainly true of Wallace in
’68? John Schmitz just didn’t have the capacity to draw that
kind of vote.
If a party of that sort makes a substantial impact
in one election, then th© usual consequence is that it goes
on to higher things, or else the other partias adjust and it’s
absorbed back into on®•of th® major parties»
But artificial preservation of third parties, as time

121
has pasti» is an inevitable result of basing federal subsidies
on prior ©lection performance.,
I raust say some thing about Chapter 96 f the matching»
grant provision.,
The subsidy amount that candidates can receive under
matching grants is mad© wholly dependent on the private contri™
buttons a candidate has raised? that is, it*s a wealth criterion
similar to tit© one you struck down in Bullock vso Carter and
Lufoin vs. Panisho
Surely what should matter is the number of contributors
to ©r supporters of a candidat®»

Instead, a single contributor

can command the matching funds checked off by 250 of his fellow'
citizens on their tax returns»

The antire scheme rewards the

candidate who gets into the race earliest, who can command the
largest number of $250 contributors, and who is supported by
special interests which can easily help him meet the 2'0»State
requirement»
A candidate who comes in at a later stage, perhaps in
response to some new development ©r some newly perceived
political issue, is heavily disadvantaged.
The provision is, in fact, working exactly in this
way»

That is demonstrated by the figtires on page 52 of our

Reply Brief, showing what the presidential candidates have
raised to date and what they have on hand.

It is apparent from

those figures that the great bulk of available federal funds is

122

likely to go to only two of the twelve present candidates?
Governor Wallace and Senator Jackson,
Most of the others, even those who have raised sub­
stantial private funds, have dissipated almost all of them
before the campaign for votes even begins,
QUESTION s What page of your Reply Brief?
MR. CLAGETT:

Page 52,

QUESTIONs Thank you,
MR, CLAGETT;
they have raised.

— have dissipated almost all the funds

You can see that by the right-hand column,

showing what they have on hand.

In a desperate attempt to raise

more small contributions.
Most of these candidates will b© a© crippled for
funds -feat whatever federal matching grants they receive will
Slot prevent -them from being driven out of the rac© at a very
early stage.
This legislation has made money more important in
campaigning than it was before, not less important, as it
allegedly x^as supposed to do.
Those problems ar© compounded by the fact, that the
mechanism for disbursing the matching grants is so fraught with
uncertainty and so dependent on diaphanous prophecies that have
to be made long.before they can be mad®, that the results may
be unfair or random in the extreme.
We set out some ©f 'these problems at pages 70 -through

123
73 of our Reply Brief*
Th© day after that brief was filed, the Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury# testifying befora th© Federal
Election Commission, confirmed ©very one of those concerns we
had expressed, arid added some new ones*

We have lodged his

testimony with the Court*
It in now cl®ar, after his testimony, that funds may
be inadequate to pay all the candidates who qualify, and that
what funds are mad© available will depend on guesses as to what
third parties may enter the ultimata general election campaign,
and what their election-day performance might be? this, in
December or January,
And there is a distinct possibility that all the
available funds will be exhausted by the first two candidates
who qualify, Wallace and Jackson, thus discriminating against
those who qualify thereafter.
Finally, the difficult decisions that must be mad© by
a partisan political appointees

President Ford’s Secretary of

the Treasury is going to decide how much money President Ford
and Mr, Reagan get for ‘the Hew Hampshire primary.

That’s a

curious Watergate reform.
Now, there are other discriminations that I haven’t
even been able to touch on, like the exclusion of Appellant
McCarthy, solely on the ground that he's an independent rather
•than affiliated with a political party,from any subsidies at

124
any stage.
We think that sons® problems of this nature, whether
the same ones or other ones, will b® present in any kind of
federal subsidy scheme that’s formulated; any such scheme will
establish some parties by favoring them over others# just as
this scheme establishes the two existing major partias.
As Mra Justice Douglas wrote in Abington School
District vs» Schsmpp, the most effective way to establish any
institution is to finance it.
Such political establishments, w@ think, cannot be
squared with freedom of speech and association, or with the
general welfare# or# indeed# with -the provisions of Articles 1
and II which contemplate free ©lections in this country»
Most of these objections wouldn’t apply to a genuine
Check-off schema# whereby each eitisan would designat® a party
or a candidate to receive the sum he checked off»

There’s

nothing impractical about a scheme like that# as we have shown
in our Reply Brief»
If there is any warrant, for federal involvement in
the campaign funding mechanism at all# such a method would
plainly be a less intrusive means *

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr» Cutler,

125
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD N. CUTLER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OB’ THE APPELLEES
MR, CUTLERs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
Sine© Mr, CXagett has not invested much of his oral
argument in his arguments as to fell® power of the federal govern*”
ment, under the general welfare clause, to provide for public
financing of ©lection campaigns, and sine® he has not devoted
much time to his argument that any such plan violates the
establishment clause of the First Amendment, which he moves
by implication over into the free speech section of the First
Amendment, I shall concentrate, as he did, on the alleged
discriminatory effects of this particular proposed public
financing.plan against the smaller parties,
-I'd like to first stress that the appellants show
little proof of injury to them to support their claim that
these provisions should fo© voided, before they've had a chance
to work in a single election.
Of the 12 plaintiffs in this action, only four assert
any interest in the public financing of presidential campaigns.
One is. Eugene McCarthy, whose claim is wholly academic as to
discrimination, because h© has testified on deposition in this
case that he would not accept public financing, even if he was
eligible.
QUESTION;

Well, does he- have no standing for that

126
reason to complain that somebody else is getting it?
MR* CUTLER;

If this were an attack on any public

financing}. Mr» Justice Rehnquist, yes.

But the attack, at least

on the discrimination front, is an attack that the public
financing provided to the so-called major parties is a discrim­
ination against him.
QUESTION* And you say he can't attack that because he
wouldn't use —
MR. CUTLER*

We say he presents no case to you that

he is being discriminated against*, by reason ©f the five percent
prevision or the money before or money after provisions* when
he says* *1 would not take it, anyway* if it war© offered."
The same is true* of course* of his party, his
Committee for a Constitutional Presidency, which is the second
plaintiff.
The same is true of the Libertarian Party, which
testified on deposition that it would not accept public
financing if offered.
And in the case of the fourth plaintiff, the
Conservative Party ©f New York, the Conservative Party of New
York has never nominated a presidential candidate who was not
also a candidat® of & major party and thus, entitled t© the full
allotment.
And no other political party* nor any present
aspirant for their *76 nominations, is before you in this case,

127
although the Socialist Workers Party has filed an amicus brief.

So most of the fascinating hypothetical© which fill
appellants’ briefs and our replies# what would have happened
in 1856# Mr. Justice Stewart# whether the equal amount for the
first arid second partias are unfair as between the two of them#
or vis-a-vis a third party# what would have happened to Bull
Moose and Eugene Debs#' . we say air® just# at the moment at least#
fascinating hypotheticals for the political hot-stove league
that can justly and should batter be left for another day.
QUESTIONt

Mr. Cutler# refresh my recollection# if

you can# on the largest percentage of votes that any third
party has ever received in our history.
MR. CUTLERs
Mr. Chief Justice.

It depends on how you define third party#

If you define «*-

QUESTIONs

Wall# the third ranking one after the

first two, in any particular election.
[Laughter. ]
MR. CUTLEEs

Well, if you say "after the first two

in any particular election" and if you ignore some ©f the very
early elections in the 1832 period, and thereabouts, I suppose
the largest percentage would be the percentage compiled by
Bull Moose, by Mr. Roosevelt# when he was running in 1912, which
I believe is of the order of 29 to 30 percent.
The reason I asked about how you define third party
is there are several other "new* parties running for the first

time in a new election that did much better than that»
are some

There

if X a&n find my reference in a moment — such as —
QUESTION: Would the next nearest to Mr. Theodora

Roosevelt's vote b© Senator LaFollette« back in th® Twenties.
MR. CUTLER: Senator LaFolletfe got about 9 percent,
l believe.
All of these figures are — well, X believe they’re
in the Joint Appendix, at about pages 34 and 35 of Volume IX-A.
But there ar® candidates, of course, like Mr. Fremont,
the Republican candidate in 1956, who finished ae the second
candidate in that year.

There are candidates like Governor

Wallace in ’68, who got, X believe, something like 12„5 to
13,5 percent of the total vote.
Indeed, there are, in th© 36 elections sine© 1832,
defining small parties as parties coining on the seen® for th©
first time or true small parties, there ar® 10 examples in
that table X referred you to, pages 35 to 42 of Volume IX-Aj
10 examples in 36 ©lections of candidatas who achieved batter

than five, pereant»
S© it’s in no sens© an impossible dream.
Th© appellants

focus on the five pereant floor,

based on votes in the preceding ©lection as a condition ©f pre­
election financing, and based on votes in the current election
as a condition of post-election financing, as their principal
claim of discrimination.

129
And I'd like to deal with -that, first from the stand­
point of the floor itself, and second frora the standpoint of
the alleged discrimination'between pre-election and post-election
financing.
These provisions are attacked as showing a studied
congressional disregard for third parties.

But, to the contrary,

as the Court, of Appeals found, the Congress took great care
neither to favor nor to disfavor the smaller parties, and it
fixed on the five percent floor and the other objectively
measurable features ©f this plan in a careful effort, and
belief that it was following the guidance of this Court.
Ths original public financing measure, as you may
recall, was enacted in 1966.

It set a floor of seven percent,

based entirely on results in the preceding ©lection,

nothing

whatever was provided based on results in the current election.
That law was suspended by Congress the following year.
And the next year, in '68, you decided Wllliaga_v«^%oies.? and
in IS 71 you decided Jennesss v. Forts on, and it was based on
the guidelines provided by those two ©pinions that Congress,
in 1971, just a few months lator, enacted the forerunner of
Chapter 95,
And the five percent figuro was taken directly, as
I said, from Jenness, based on 'the holding that before providing
access to the printed ballot, a State can reasonably require a
showing of a significant modicum of support, and that five per-

130

cent was a reasonable floor for that purpose.
And if you look at fch© Report of the Senate Rules
Committee proposing that legislation, you will see it refers
specifically to Jennass and to Williag«

Rhodes, that it

specifically recognises the constitutional right of a minor
party to grow into a major political fores© and that it correctly,
we believe, said, quoting Jenneas, that its bill did not freeze
the political status quo»
QUESTION5

Mr. Cutler, do you think that perhaps the

State might have more latitude than Congress, since it's the
state that's responsible for the physical preparation of the
ballet and the limitation, somehow, of the sis® of the ballot;
whereas, presumably, Congress doesn't face exactly that problem
in doling out money.
MR. CUTLER5

I see a distinction, Justice Rehnquist,

between the preparation — or between a standard for qualifica­
tion to b© on the printed ballot, perhaps, and qualification to
receive federal financing.

But I don't see any other distinction

between the constitutional standards applicable to the States and
these applicable to the federal government, or the need that
either is trying to serve in disposing of frivolous candidacies
and doing its best to see that the ©lection itself does not
suffer from splintering, and serves the ideal of a two-party
system, as long as it does not favor two particular parties.
QUESTION: Well, what interest is Congress pursuing in,

131
as you say* making aura that the thing doesn't splinter?

I

mean# how would you define that as a legitimate or desirable
goal on the part of Congress?
MRa CUTLER:

Well* I would define it in precisely the

way* 1 believe, this Court defined it in Sborer ve Brown* in
American Party v. White and in others, of th© State ballot and

ooiLasaM^iatje^ae^^ii^-vitas^sssttsan^^JiieaaSmcemMmaaMuaaamiuaiaKiatt

Stefcs primary financing cases* in which you held, that on® of
the legitimate public aims of the government would be to foster
some stability in the political process by having ihe ultimat®
election, at least, be one that was not an, opportunity to
continuo the sort of intra-party fight that had gone on during
primaries and during the preparatory process; so that the
ultimata outcome of th© ©lection could coma as close as possible
to reflecting th© views of a majority,,
QUESTION*

And you .s©3 no distinction- in a State's

role and Congress's role in fostering that?
MR* CUTLER*

Well, I don't see it, Justice

Rehnquist, in the sens® that th© same interest, if itrs appli­
cable at tli© State level, is infinitely more applicable at the
national level, considering th© many responsibilities on the
national government and the interest that must exist at th©
national level, not to have tee problems of many# many splinter
parties, none cf which has a majority# and not to have &
President elected either by a plurality or perhaps even by a
minority of the ©lectorat©*

132
Now# appellants have argued that the five percent
figure upheld, in Jeaness was less restrictive because it. was a
figure for a petition that could include voters who had voted
for other candidates in the preceding electiori# ©r who had
signed other petitions*

But the five percent in this law may

well be a less onerous requirement, because it*s five percent
©f a much smaller universe*

It’s five percent of the SO or 70

percent of the electorate that votes, which is something of a
national scale of the order of four million people, rather than
five percent of those registered as eligible to vote, which
must be well over five million, because the number of eligible
— 1 correct myself, not eligible to vote? registered to vote,
*»«*• because the number ©f eligible voters in 1976 is estimated
to be something of the order of 150 million people, of -whom
probably well over 100 million will actually be registered*
Appellants have not proven, as the Court said in
Jenness, that ©n® five percent goal is any significantly harder
to reach than the other, and it would seem to us that this one
satisfies not only the test of Jenness but also the test of
S tor gig v, Brown, which also was five percent of the votes cast
in the preceding election, although it was a petition basis*
But the Court had trouble with that level in Sfcorer
y. Brown, not because it was five percent of the voters in the
preceding ©lection, but because excluded from that universe were
any people who had voted in the primary? something that does not

133
happen her©»
We would also say that ©vea if Congress was constitu­
tionally wrong in setting a five percent floor of votes, as a
condition for public financing, that wouldn't require the
Chapter to be invalidated in its entirety«

When a statute

discriminates unconstitutionally because of under»»inclusion,
the Court need not declare that, statute a nullity, but can
extend the coverage of the statuta t© those who are aggrieved
by the exclusion, if that would better effectuate th© legis­
lative purpose»
And of course you did that last term in Weinberger v,
Wiesenfold, in which you found it was unconstitutional to bar
social security coverage for widowers while giving it to widows,
you did not declare it unconstitutional to pay widows? instead,
you took car© of it on an tinder"-inclusion basis by saying that
widowers also had to b© paid»
Applying the same theory hare, we say it would
cartainly be more consistent with th© congressional intent,
rather than to strike down -the entire public financing scheme,
to extend public financing on a proportional basis to parties
or to candidates who garners less than five pereant of the votes
in th© preceding election»
Next, the attack is on any floor based on results in
the preceding ©lection, because it bars the candidates ©f
parties falling below that floor, as well as candidates of no

134
parties or of new parties, from receiving any public financing
before the ©lection*
They haven’t suggested any more workable method of
proving before an election a significant modicum of support.
The latest idea that Mr. Clagett has put forth, signatures of
five pereant of the eligible voters on a petition, as in the
ease of Jennea®, we would say is highly impractical and certainly,
whether or not Congress could have chosen that method, on© it
is entitled to have rejected.
Five percent of the registered voters in Georgia was
83,000 voters.

Five percent of the registered voters in the

United States, as I indicated earlier, is probably well over
five million voters.
For a candidate to compile and for the FEC, the
Election Commission, to have to verify some five million
signatures of voters in 40 to 50 States, raises enough questions
about cost and feasibility *»- in Jennass, according to the
stipulation in that case at page 87 on fils with the Court, the
cost to Georgia of verifying the 88,000 signatures was approxi­
mately a dollar per signature.

The cost was something like

75 to 80 thousand dollars for ©ach of the two petitions that
Georgia had recently cleared in that case.
Moreover, as the Court of Appeals found, the appellants
have failed to show that the inability of those who fail the
five, percent test to obtain pre-election financing disadvantages

135
them in any way*

of course, pre-election money would be better

than post-alection money*
But, even before the advent of major party financing#
the *»« public financing# I*m sorry? the major-party candidates
were able to raise pre-election money to a vastly greater
extent than the smaller party candidates e and Chapter 95 is
not going to change that differential to the detriment of the
smaller candidates*
In ’72 the Republican candidate raised nearly $60
million privately# most ©£ it before the election*

The

Democratic candidata nearly $39 million privately# most of it
before the election*
Even if you applied retroactively the rule of the new
statute? against contributions in excess ©f $i#GQ0 and eliminated
all of those excesses from the * 72 figures # ©&ch candidate
raised well over $24 million*
All of the minor-party presidential candidates
combined raised approximately $1 million.

On® percent of the

hundred million that the major-party candidatas raised# if you
ignore the $1#Q0G ceiling# and two percent of what they raised
if you apply the $1#Q0Q ceiling*
S© we would say to yon that in *76# at least if you
look at the *72 figures# the small-party candidates and any no-»
party candidates certainly are not going to be worse off vis-avis the major-party candidates in terms of pre-election funding#

136
because of Chapter 95.

In fact, if you take la to account the ceilings on.
contributions and the ceilings on expenditures, it looks as if
they would very likely b© better off, and, at the very least,
as the Court of appeals agreed, they have not proven any real
danger that they are going to be worse off.
Next, Xld like to come t© Mr» Ciagett.’s point about
the constitutionally required alternative moans for pre-election
financing, leaving asid© the distinction between pre-election
and post-election financing, of course, an alternative means is
provided in this statute, because the party which dees achieve
the five parcent level in the currant ©lection will receive
post-election money — and 1511 gat to Mr* Ciagett"a point
about, the loan distinction in just a moment*
QUESTIONS

Mr. Cutler, if a First Amendment violation

is found to exist, determined to exist, does it make any
difference, then, whether it operates against small and new
parties, or for them, or against or for the major parties?
MR, CUTLERs

1 would suppose not, Mr. Chief Justice,

but 31 do not apprehend the argument about discrimination in
this statute to be a First Amendment argument.
1 understand it to be a Fifth Amendment argument.
Their only First Amendment argument against public
financing is one which Mr* Ciagett did not really address him­
self to in the oral argument, both of us have discussed it

137
extensively in our briefs, that's the claim that it somehow
violates the establishment language of the religion clause of
the First Amendmentr which he would move, by osmosis, into the
speech and assembly portion of the First Amendment.
QUESTIONi

But doesn't the Fifth Amendment question

take on a different aspect, if you are in the voting and election
area?

In terms of what you have to

what the government might

have to show.
MR. CUTLER: Wall, 1 would certainly agree, Justice
White, that any public financing scheme or ballot access scheme
which discriminated unfairly against minor parties or new
parties would be unconstitutional, perhaps it's just as
unconstitutional under the First Amendment as under the Fifth
Amendment? but the essence of the showing would be a showing of
discrimination.

And, absent the showing of discrimination, it

would seem to sm that the power to provide for the public
welfare —■
QUESTIONs

And you aren't saying that there's

discrimination, but it’s justified? you're saying there’s no
dis crimination?
MR. CUTLER:

We*re saying there is no constitutionally

invidious discrimination, *—
QUESTIONs
MR. CUTLER:

Well, then, there is some discrimination?

I won’t quote hie phrase»
Differentiation?
Yes»

[Laughter»]
MR» CUTLERs

I would like to com® back, though, to the

alternative means that have been provided for pre-election
financing»
First, just as the Court in J.&nness found,, that this
was on© of the alternative means there, an individual aspirant
for the presidency instead of competing for the nomination of
a minor party or going it, alon© could, as Plaintiff McCarthy
did in I960, compete for the nomination of a major party? and
if h© succeeds, he would of course get -the full entitlement of
funds e
If he prefers the nomination of the minor non-qualify­
ing party, Chapter 95 permits its candidate, as well as those

139
who are entitled to some public financing but lees than 'dies
full allotment, to continue to raise private contributions?
while it requires those who qualify and accept the full 20
million not to raise any private contributions»
So that any small-party or no-party candidate who
demonstratas sufficient strength will be free to raise pre­
election funds commensurate with that strength and, as was
noted a few moments ago, George Wallace did precisely that
in 1968«

He raised almost $7 million, which was 12«5 parcent

of what ail presidential

candidates raised, at a time when he

accounted for 13»5 percent of the total presidential vote?
and certainly a lot of that strength was visible before the
©lection, and that*a why he was able to raise•the money»
And it’s —»
QUESTION:

Mr. Cutler, are you directing yourself to

th© situation where a candidate runs in, let’s say, Democratic
Party primaries in the various States, wins some, runs well in
some, runs badly in others; and then, at the Democratic National
Convention, is not nominated«

And then that same man decides

to run as a no-party person, an independent person; what
happens to the matching funds that he has collected as a primary
candidate, if they are unexpended?
MRa CUTLER;

I have to admit, Justice Stewart, that

is a question I have not thought of, that any candidate would
have unexpended matching funds»

140
QUESTION:

Well, there may not be, but. it is a

speculative situation,,
MR* CUTLER*

No, no»

But I would think his funds are

his funds, if he was running in the primary, and that they would
be available to him thereafter* and certainly he could there%

after run as an independent? and, having run as an independent,
he might make himself eligible for funds in the next ©lection*
I*d like to deal vary briefly, if I could, with the
point that post-election financing iaillusory, because it can
only be used to repay loans*
Well, of course, it’s perfectly possible to rais®
money before the ©lection on a contingent-loan basis„

Many,

many contributions, so-called, are given in the form of loans,
to be repaid if the cmididat© is in a position to repay those
loans*
QUESTION;

Incidentally, this is taking us back to

the subject of this morning»

Are these limitations on contri­

butions and on expenditures — contributions particularly, do
they cover loans or do they deal with loans?
MR* CUTLERs

A loan — a contribution includes a

loan —
QUESTIONs
MR* CUTLERs

It does?
— except for this particular purpose

of defining what a recipiant of post-election public financing
can spend*

He may repay, us® some of that money to repay a

14 X
loan, and that loan is excluded fro® the definition of
contribution for that purposea
QUESTION?
MRo CUTLERS
QUESTIONS
MR„ CUTLERs

Just for that purpose?
Right»
I see,
I*d like to go very briefly to Plaintiff

McCarthy, who says that he can never be entitled to this public
financing he distains, because he is not a party candidata»
The answer t© that, as the Court of Appeals indicated,
is ther© is no definition
statute»

of party in this portion of the

He has a Committee for a Constitutional Candidacy , [sic|

I believe it's called, McCarthy '76? that committee could vary
well be defined as a party, and the PEC is holding rule-making
proceedings considering that very issue right now,
I haven't had time to get to the less restrictive means
©f the voucher plan and the tax return check-off? I'd like to
discuss them, if I could, just very briefly.
The voucher plan has a number or difficulties, of
which the most significant is the danger of block trading of
vouchers, vouchers would be lik.a money, people could buy them»
There would also be very high administrative costs in dealing
with vouchers worth only a dollar or two dollars? the cost of
collecting those might very well turn out to be more than what
they would be worth in the end.
So far as the check-off for a candidate of your choice

142
is concerned, sine® the check-offs are keyed to the four tax
dates, it*s not even, clear on the last of those dates, April
151 1976, who th® candidates are really going to be„
Moreover,

Congress wanted

anci 1 think, again, this

was a legitimate congressional purpose «— t© have equal allotments
of funds to any party 'feet got over 25 percent, in order, ©3
much as possible, to balance things out for a two or three-party
race in the next election»
And a candidate of your choice check-off provision
could not be accommodated to that sort ©f a system..
Lastly# there is th© matching suggestion, which is
not advocated by appellants, because they object to matching on
other grounds, but is suggested by th® Attorney General, and
matching, we submit, suitable as it may b® for th© primary
period, is wholly unsuitable for the regular ©lection, for th©
very same reason I mentioned earlier, Mr» Justice Rehnquist,
the legitimate interest of either the federal government or the
State government in trying to develop soar.® kind of a majority
choice at the federal ©lection*
So a proliferation ©f many, many candidatos in the
final election is something Congress, we say, could constitu­
tionally prefer not to encourage*
Finally, with respect to th© primary system, the
matching for primarias, we'll have to rely on our brief for

most of that; but I do want-to point out to the Court that ther®

143
is not a single plaintiff before it who intends to enter the
primaries or who has pleaded that ha intends to do that»
Of all the hypothetical issues raised in this ease,
all put before you by non-plaintiffs or involving non-plaintiffs,
the on® least related to these particular plaintiffs is entering
a national primary ,,
QUESTION%

Mr. Cutler, in view of your contentions

about standing, it becomes fairly important whether this public
financing question is regarded as a First Amendment question
or a Fifth Amendment question, doesn’t it?

Because ordinarily

we wouldn’t apply overbreadth if it were just a Fifth Amendment
thing,
MR. CUTLERs Well, certainly the appellants have
raised First Amendment issues, which I did not cover, namely,
these establishment clause issues.

That aside, we would argue

it is essentially a Fifth Amendment rather than a First Amend­
ment question.
Thank you vary i?

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very well, Mr. Cutler,
Mr, Ciagett, yon8vs reserved five minutes for
rebuttal,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRICE M. CLAGETT, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, CLAGETT *

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

One of Mr, Cutler’s last points was that the check-off

144
liras impractical because designations ars keyed to the April 15th
income tax date*
The answer to that is found in our brief*
no reason in the world why there need be.

There’s

You could have a

check-off which was mad® by a separate fora immediately after
tii© nominating conventions, for example, or something of that
nature.

And that could apply for all the four years.
You wouldn’t h&v© a one-dollar check-off ©very year,

but a four-dollar check-off, say, immediately after th©
Conventions in ©lection years.

A perfectly practical, simple

system, which would avoid all this business of Congress’s
deciding who gat® the money and-whan and on what basis.
That-would mean that th© government was acting as a simple
conduit for money that went from th® taxpayers„
QUESTION* Ara you going to address th© standing
argument of Mr. Cutler?
MR. CLAGETTs

Yes, Your Honor.

We definitely have a First Amendment argument as well
as a Fifth Amendment argument hero.

If you consider, for

example, your decision in International Machinists Association
vs. Street, where you held that it violated First Amendment
freedom of speech for a labor union, with a union shop .contract,
to spend members * dues to support political candidacies with
which soma members disagreed.
Just here, tax money is used to pay candidates without

145

Appellees’ argument that the check-off is voluntary
is wholly beside the point,

©f the general treasury, sad thus is involuntarily contributed

QUESTION; Well, that was the point of my question,
MR, CLAGETT;

QUESTIONS

It’s just like a general appropriation,

Yes,

MR» CLAGETT;

it’s just like the appropriation out

of its general funds that the labor union made in the street
case.

And what made that, unconstitutional was "that money was

being used to support some and not all political speech without
regard to what political spaach the people whose money it was
wished to support,
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t it the essence cf authoritarian

And the Street

It said:

We*re not saying

a labor union can’t take dues and do lots of things with

political candidates with whim some members disagreed.
You said that was different.

That posed a First

We think exactly the same analysis applies

here.
QUESTION*

But did Street suggest that a labor

union couldn’t solicit from its members contributions for
political purposes?
MR. CLAGETT:

Not at all, Justice White.

QUESTION s And did it suggest that if it did solicit
for political purposes it could only spend it. for the particular
candidate that individual contributors designated?
MR. CLAGETT:

No, sir. This was dues it was talking

Just as here we’re talking about —

And also it was dues that the law required

them to collect.
MR. CLAGETT:

was because the 'force of law was behind it.
MR. CLAGETT:

That’s absolutely correct.

Just as

her©* the collection of taxes has the force of law behind it*
and the check-off is academic* because the money comas out of
the general treasury.
QUESTION;

Well* it may not be that different* Mr.

Clagett. but there* of course* the remedy was for the union
member to get it back.

And here h© may check-off ©r not, as

he pleases, but he doesn't get his dollar back? it goes into
the general treasury as taxes.
QUESTIONz

And he certainly has consented that his

dollar b® used for political

The people who haven’t checked off

haven't consented to that* and it’s their money that’s really

That’s my point.

MR. CLAGETT:

That’s exactly right.

148
QUESTIONS

All of them would have been, resolved,

would they not, largely if not all, if the check-off had been
to add a dollar to the taxpayer's bill and then give that money
to this general fund?
MR. CLAGETT:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justics.

We would have no problem with that* along the lines
I’ve indicated, if it resulted still in the money being paid
out pursuant to an allocation by Congress, we would still have
at least the discrimination point, and perhaps more.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, your time has
expired, Mr. Clagett.
MR. CLAGETT:

Yes „

One final word on the

on this

credit point that Mr, Cutler mentioned.
Tbs exemption of loans from the contribution defini­
tion, or rather from the contribution limits for post-election
funding apply only to bank loans.

And banks aren't, going to

lend money to new or minor political parties without a guarantee,
and the contribution limit does apply to the guarantee.
Therefore, the remedy Mr. Cutler suggests is utterly
illusory«
QUESTION:

Mr* Clagett, one final question.

You’re

not saying, as I understand your position, that public financing
by the government out of toe general treasury, for example, is
invalid, per sej you are saying it. is invalid when it is
discriminatory?

MR® CLAGETT:

NO way?

MR» CLAGETT:

to it*

I can think of a lot less discriminatory ones than this®
QUESTION: As I understand it, from your brief at least#

that you say that even assuming there could b® & non-discrimin­
atory system, it's nonetheless unconstitutional, violative of

Thanks a lot®

MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

You may now proceed to

your argument in chief, then, on the third point, Mr® Clagetfe*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRICE M» CLAGETTf ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, CLAGETT*

Yes, sir.

This part of the ease presents the questions

whether

Congress may establish, to administer and enforce the Federal
Election law, with the complete panoply of powers appropriate
to that end; an agency which is neither • a part of the Executive
Branch nor an Independent Agency,' but rather an alter-ego of

1

Congress itself, which the Commission is conceded to be.
No one, I think, denies that the question is substantial
and, indeed, serious®
Certainly Congress’s normal function in our const!tutional scheme is to pass laws, not to administer or enforce
them.
It is urge at ’the outsat that these questions are not
ripe for decision, and that we have no standing to raise them.

\

151
1 turn, then, first, to ripeness»
Insofar as we attack ‘the method of appointment of the
Commission, its right to exist is constituted, we are talking,
of course, about appointments which war© made many months ago..
The Commission, as so appointed, is in full operation.

Every

day it is taking actions which have vast, impact on the political
process,
QUESTION{ But I would think, Mr, Clagett, that if you
were to be able to challenge that with the Commission ©v®r
having done anything to arty of your clients, you would have t©
validate virtually a taxpayer's action for the federal govern­
ment, which this Court has never done.

MR, CLAGETT*

Mot at all,

I submit, Justice

Rehnquist, the appellants are all members of the class which
have a right to seek advisory opinions? as political candidates
and parties and committees, they are directly impacted by the
Commission's rules and regulations.

The Commission has don©

things teat affect them directly and which harm them.
Just two or three exampless
As challengers, which most of these appellants are,
and as parties in interest supporting challengers, these
plaintiffs are drastically injured, not by what the Commission
did, ironically, in the office account rule, but in Congress’s
veto of that rule, which the Commas ion passed,

The Commission passed a rule which would, to some

152
slight modest extant, have mitigated incumbent advantages, and
therefore benafitted appellants,

And Congress used the legis­

lative veto on it,
So the result of the establishment of the Commission
as a legislative agency and subject to the legislative veto is
that appellants ware injured,
QUESTIONs Well, but they were injured not by the action
of the Commission but by Congress’s action in overturning the
Commission,
MR, CLAGETTj

They were injured by the establishment

of the Commission# by the vesting of enforcement and interpreta­
tion power of this statute in an agency which couldn't insist
on its own rule# but which was subject to Congress's legislative
veto.
QUESTION: But# then, that sterns from the availability
of the veto and not the composition of the Commission.
MR, CLAGETT: What w© challenge is the Commission as
a legislative agency.

It is mad© a legislative agency by

several things, but essentially by two things:
First, the appointment power? second, the legislative
veto.
In this particular instance, it was the legislative
veto that was the more conspicuous element of legislative
control,
This isn’t the only thing the Commission has done that

153
hurts appellants. The advisory opinion,, subjecting lawyers'
and accountants' fees to the expenditure limits# which came
down about ten days ago# I believe# and which we've lodged
with the Court# was# as th® two dissenting Commissioners said#
terribly hostile to the interest of newcomers and challengers
to the political seen©# who have greater burdens in trying to
figure out what this legislation means and to comply with it#
than incumbents do.
This advisory opinion expressly injured challengers#
directly injured them in that sms®.
Senator McCarthy# the Commission has tried to audit
him# they have threatened him with the use of their civil
enforcement power# they backed off a bit; after this litigation
is terminated# we query whether they will continue backing off
on that.

Certainly he believes that he is directly injured by

attempts to audit him# to find out the identify of his contri­
butors down as low as $1GG# and so on..
The disclosure regulations# which there’s just a
notice so far on them# they haven't been formally adopted yet.
The great burdensomeness of 'those regulations, what a number of
observers have called the almost incredible complexity 'and the
new conditions# the new requirements that the Commission is
piling on top of th® statutory requirements.

For example#

keeping photostats of every check# which there is nothing about
in the statute.

154
These similarly impact directly on appellants, to
the extent that they have to file reports, which almost all of
them do, they have filed them; and they injure appellants
certainly insofar as they are challengers and newcomers«
It emerges clearly from the statutory scheme that the
law is to be administered and enforced primarily by the
Commission itself, -through a whole spectrum of powers;

State­

ments ©f general policy# both interpretative and substantive
rule-making, advisory

opinions, entertaining complaints,

conducting investigations and audits # holding hearings on
complaints and undertaking conciliation procedures„
That battery of powers, in the overwhelming majority
©£ cases, should be sufficient to compel compliance with the
Commi,ssion's view of the law.
Resort to a civil enforcement proceeding, whether
brought by the Commission itself or by the Attorney General at
its direction should rarely to® necessary.
The bulk of these powers, have already been exercised.
The Commission has made rules, it's issued advisory opinion,
it's adrainistaring the federal subsidy provisions, certifica­
tions, and whatnot.

It has also investigated complaints and

conducted audits, and it has, we are informed, procured
compliance with its view through conciliation proceedings in
at least fifty cases so far.
Those proceedings are secret, so they are not announced

155
to the public, but we*re told there have been at least fifty
of them that have bean brought to conclusion so far.
The Commission has even exercised the power which the
Commission's counsel tell you the Commission does not possess?
that is* the power to issue rules governing both the meaning
and the administration of the expenditure and contribution
limits .
I confess to a lively curiosity as to what Professor
Sprifcser is going to tell you about -chat..
But as to

all the powers except for rule-making and

bringing enforcement proceedings* the Commission and its counsel
are in agreement -that they apply to the expenditure and contri­
bution limits •&« well as to the disclosure provisions.
In any event* Congress gave the Commission all its
powers* those exercised and those few* such as the power to
disqualify a candidate* which are yet un.ex@rc.ised? and the
issue hers is the facial constitutionality of legislation which
doss that when the depository of power is an arm of Congress.
Can Congress validly set up this sort of agency with
all these statutory powers by this method of appointment* and
subject to this legislative veto?
QUESTION: Well* you say th® facial constitutionality*
but* now, what does that mean* outside of the First Amendment
area?
MR, CLAGETTs Separation of powers* Justice Rehnqulst»

IBS'

QUESTION: Well, do you say that there is no need for
•fch® person challenging the Commission to have been affected or
be in a controversy with it if he

challenges the separation

of powers?
MRa CLAGETTs Well# let me — that's a standing
question,

And as to our standing, the Court of Appeals# of

course, had no problem with it.
The citizen or taxpayer analogy we think is certainly
wrong,

I’v® mentioned a number ©f aspects where we’ve been.
$

hurt by specific things that the Commission doss. But, even
beyond that, separation ©f powers was net put in the Constitu­
tion for the benefit of federal office holders.

It was put

there to avoid tyranny, that's what Madison said.
He -««id:

If the legislature determines the powers,

the honors and emoluments of the office, w© should b® insecure
if they were to designate- the officer also.
Now, we -think this case is just like Glidden Company
vs, adanok,

Thera the litigant, was held to have standing to

raise the Article III question because the Court held that the
Article ill provisions were put in there, at least in part, for
the benefit of litigants«

*

QUESTIONS But h© had a case decided against him on the
merits by a court# including a judge, of whom he complained,
MR, CLAGETT;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir*

And my question really is, not so much

15?
that, to suggest that you don't have an actual case or contro­
versy , but why do you refer to it as a facial attack?

If in

fact the Commission has harmed you, why do you need to talk
about the facial unconstitutionality of it?
MR. CL&GETTj We think the Commission harms us by
existing in violation of the separation of powers, and
exercising regulatory control over us, which it is doing ©very
day.
We have had to file reports with them. We are subject
to their opinions.

We are subject to their rules.

If w@ do something they don't like, they will take
us through these conciliation proceedings; and if we don't
knuckle under then, then they will take us to the court or have
someone els© do so.
Now, it is particularly poignant, 1 think, on that
point that, although far from necessary to our standing, that,
appellants represent primarily challengers and newcomers to
the political process, and we say that,by having these laws
administered by a legislative agency. Congress has deliberately
retained enormous discretion, power, arid control over the
enforcement and administration of these statutes, which trench
so sharply upon the comparative fairness and equity as between
challengers, on -the on© hand, and incumbents on the other.
On© side has retained the power not only to set but
to administer and enforce the rales of the political game.

158
As challengers and newcomers, we think we have to have
standing to question th®fe„
And we donTt think it goes anywhere near as far as
standing in a great many of your cases.
As to the merits?, once -the Commission is conceded to
be a legislative agency/, which can do nothing that Congress
could not do itself, how can its appointment and powers and the
legislative veto possibly be justified?
The Commission’s answer is that there is something
special about political campaigns, which makes regulation of
them different from every other subject of federal law ~~

a year; wouldn't they?

I mean., all the Federal Salary Acts

provide for one-house veto.

3.62

MR. CLAGETTs

Jus tic® Rahnquist, the legislative veto

can arise in a great, number of different contexts.

For example,

in the executive agreement context, which so ranch has been
o£
written about, there it's a question/whether Congress is unduly
intruding into the foreign affairs power.
There's no question of ‘that sort here.
In some circumstances it can arise when Congress is
essentially making new law, passing new statutes? and there it
has to have the concurranee of the President.
Here, you have the legislative veto added to the
appointment mechanism, and we think that those two tilings put
together clearly make this Commission an aria ©f Congress, a
Legislatlva agency *
Now, all parties are agreed as to that.
then, becomes?'

The question,

Can a Legislative agency, can an arm of Congress

perform the fmotions,exercise -the powers which Congress has
been given her®?
Could Congress perform these functions dir@ct.ly?
f

And, if not, can it perform them through its controlled agen^?
In other words, you do not, tc resolve this case, have
to hold that ta® legislative veto, either as a general proposi­
tion or,©van in this one manifestation, is itself unconstitu­
tional.

The legislative veto comes in as one of those facts

of life which make the Commission an arm of Congress.
question becomes:

And the

whether an arm of Congress can do this?

163

QUESTIONS

Just give me on© example.

What has the

Commission dor»© to you# specifically# which in so doing repre­
sents a legislative rather than an executive function?
Or as an executive function rather 'than a legislative function?
MR, CLAGETTs
QUESTION *

They are executive functions»

Yes?

MR, CLAGETT:

Well# name m® one.

Name me one.

All right# the advisory opinion on

attorneys' and accountants* fees,
QUESTION? Well now# that would be no different than a
regulation# would it?
MR» CLAGETTs

It could have don© it by regulation#

we assume it will.
QUESTION?

So it’s really — so you put that in the

same category as the — as Congress retaining the power to pass
on a regulation?
MR* CLAGETT:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.

But it’s no more — it’s no worse than

that?
MR. CLAGETTs
QUESTION:

Well# it all depends on —

Is there anything any closer to sort of

an enforcement action?
i.

MR. .CLAGETTs
QUESTION:

Oh# yes.

Well# what is it?

That it has don© to any of these plaintiffs?
MR, CLAGETTs

Well# they asked to audit Senator

164
McCarthy's records.

Senator McCarthy said, ”1 object.3

They wrote back

this is an Appendix to our brief,

our first brief not the Reply Brief.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLAGETT:

They wrote back a letter, which is

attached there, it’s pages B~1 and B-2, the very last page of
our first brief, in which they saids
r'The Act assigns civil jurisdiction to the Commission
of all apparent violations of the Act and ©£w and then it goes
and list the expenditure and contribution limits, and "we have
a right to conduct audits'1, and so forth, and "we're charged
to correct any apparent violations by informal methods of
conciliation and, if that doesn't work, we can bring an
enforcement proceeding."
QUESTIONi

Well, are you saying that the litigating

function is exclusively an. Executive function?
MR. CLAGETT s To enforce compliance with criminal
statutes?

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, indeed I am.
QUESTION;

Including the investigative, the pr©“

enforcement investigative functions?
MR. CLAGETT;

Yes, indeed.

We see no reason why

Congress directly or through an agent can go around investigating
alleged violation of the Election Law, any more than it can of
the Antitrust Laws for purposes of enforcement.
QUESTION;

Except for legislative purposes?

165
HR.-. CLAGETT:

Except for legislative purposes.

And that5 s -«
QUESTIONi The probi©:® I have, you say the statute is
facially unconstitutional# and all you bring us is what the
Commission has done.
Does that have anything to do with whether it’s
facially unconstitutional or not?
MR.. CLAGETT;

The statutory language gives the Commis­

sion power to do those things# some of which it has done# some
of which it hasn't don®.
QUESTXGNs

We think that ~-

Well# are we free to interpret that with­

out considering what the Commission has tried to do?

Or do we

hsv© to be bound by what the Commission has don®?
MR, CLAGETT:

W© think the former# Your Honor,

You cm consider not only those powers which the
Commission has exercised# but those which it has? it has
exercised most <f them.
QUESTIONs

There are only two# as far as 1 know# —
You included that statement of the

Commission and all in soma memorandum, I saw the other day you
also referred us to a New York Times article? d© you want us to
consider that# too# while we’re at it?
MR. CLAGETT2

I think that was in the subsidy

section# wasn’t it?
QUESTION: Well# wherever it was# it had your name on
it.

166
MR, CL&GETT;

We til ink

« we think that all you need

is the statute; all you need is the statute.

The powers which

are given -and the qualities that make it a legislative agency,
all are plain, and set forth in the statute»
The only reason I have dwelt to any extent on what
the Commission has done is that . ripeness and stending have
been raised as issues,
QUESTIONs

Hew would you classify the power to strike

a candidat® from the ballot, in which of the three categories
would you say that falls?
MR, CL&GETTs

I would have to put that in a fourth

category, Mr, Chief Justice, and say that it’s something that
no on© can. do, whether th© Executives, the Legislative or the
Judiciary,
And I think Powell.vb ,.McCormack stands for that
proposition.

It addressed it at a later stage, at th© stage

of exclusion? but if you can’t exclude a Member when h© comes
before -she House with the qualifications and the credentials,
1 don’t sea how either Congress or anyone else could strike him
off the

hallot,
QUESTION?

You don’t think the judicial review saves

it any, if the initial power rests with the Commission?
MR» CLAGETT?

No, I don’t think that saves it at all»

Mr» Chief Jusfeic©»
It seems to m© to be a power which the Constitutional

167
Convention is quite clear- it. should not be exercised by anyone.
All the comments of the Framers, which are sat out at such
great length in Powell vs. McCormack, to the effect that it
must be the people who choose their representatives, and 'that
if there are to be any limitations on who can become representa­
tives , it must be the Constitution itself which imposes them,
and no others ««no others can sneak in there in any way
whatsoever.
Madison and Hamilton war© both cxystalclear about
that, and it's all set forth in Powell vs Vi^McCormack,

And we

think it follows, necessarily, from that that the disqualifica­
tion power is unconstitutionala
QUESTIONs Well, what about a candidate who was
demonstrably not eligible to b© a candidate, was not a citizen
of the United States for an office which required that?

You

say no branch of the government would have any power to take
him off the ballot?
MR. CLAGEXT:

Well, there*s.no question that the

House, of course, can exclude him#
QUESTION: After h@*s elected?
MR. CIiAGETTs

After he’s elected.

The question then

becomes whether one branch, and, if so, which on© could
anticipate that and say, ttW@ don’t want you cluttering up the
ballot ..when you’re sure to be excluded when you shew up»'5
X have not — I cannot say I have thought exhaustively

168
about that question, but the answer that immediately suggests
itself to a® is that that should be left to the house at the
time he shows up«

That it is to that house that the enforcement

of those constitutional qualifications have been given»

And

for anyone else to take him off the ballot would be t© make
someone other than the house the judge of the qualifications
©f its new members«
QUESTION 3

You think fehi would b© like the candidates

who were refused their seats because they held commissions as
Generals or, in ©no case, held a commission as a United States
Attorney? that would be the same kind ©f a mechanism?
MR» CLAGRTT3
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir»

Would you go so far as to a residential

requirement?
MR* CLAGETT:

Well, a residential requirement is

on® of the constitutional requirements, I believe»
QUESTION:

Yes.

But do you think anyone -» that

no

branch of government could enforce that except the house itself
to which the person is elected?
MR. CLAGETT:

Well, the State can certainly keep him

off the ballot, and I assume would do so,,
QUESTION: Well, ife succeeded in doing so in one of
the Carolinaa last time, didn't it?
MR. CLAGETT:

2*m not familiar with that, Your Honor.

Qh, yes, of course, I knew? tee governorship.

QUESTION:

How about a candidate for the presidency

^h© w«« net a native-born citizen of th© United States?
Natural*»bom, ®kcub®

natural-bom citizen of the

United States»
MR. CEAGETTs

1 would think in pursuance, of its- .power

to regulate the time# place and manner of electioni, Congress
could certainly set up some mechanism to be administered by
someone other than itself to make sure that people like that
didn’t get on the ballot.,
There’s no question that the power

that the federal

congressional power over ©lections is very bread»

But it is a

legislative power, it is to b© exercised by law, and there’s all
the difference in the world between saying that Congress can
legislative broadly on this subject on til© on© hand, and saying
\

that it can retain to itself the enforcement and administrative
power.
That’s what is wrong with this statute.
Mid th© disclosure — the disclosure provisions don’t
have anything to do, in our submission, with th© informationgathering function, on the ground that they are justified,
tod appellees themselves, and Mr. Friedman this morning made it
perfectly clear that legislative oversight isn’t th© reason
for the disclosure provisions.
The reason for the disclosure provisions are, first,
to inform th© public and, second, to enforce the contribution

170
©Bd expenditure limits»
And to call a very thing that the Commission does in
the way of enforcing fell® disclosure provisions mere informationgathering is just, we think, completely specious.

They're

just as »« administering those is just as bad as administering
the expenditure and contribution limits directly.
Thank you»
HR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Spritser.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH S. SPRITZER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OP THE APPELLEES
MR. SPRITZERs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

Your Honors:
•I’d like to take a moment, at Mr. Cutler*a request,
to*p&bvide an item of information in response asked earlier,
I think by Justice Stewart.

He would like to point out that

it is Section 9038(b) (3) which deals with the saattur of
unexpended primary matching funds, and it doss require that
they be returned.
I propose, ©f course, to address mya©If t© the
question of the legitimacy of the Commission and of the powers
that have bean accorded it by the legislation*
And we do think, as Justice Rehniqust’s questions
have highlighted, that there is a question of standing with
respect to this part of the case, which does lie at the threshold,
and does have to be addressed here.

171
By and large, appellants accept the view that if 'tills
Commission had boon appointed, all of its members, by the
President, that it would b® able to exercise the powers that
have been accorded it,
QUESTION:

Didn't h@ answer —

MR, SPRITZERs

There may have bean an exception —

excuse me?
QUESTIONs

Didn't he answer that, the absence of the

veto power also?
I thought he coupled the two,
MR, SPRITZER*

He Aid, Your Honor, but I think at

least the fundamental objection to this Commission’s legitimacy,
m they put it# and to its having particular powers — and 2
shall come to this veto, legislative veto point also,
I think their fundamental concern is that — is the
claim that this violates the President’s constitutional preroga­
tive to appoint officers of the United States,
Mid our point as to that is that it’s hard to see how
appellants have standing to act her® as the President’s
champion.

Because this is a question which goes solely to the

allocation of the appointed power within the federal establish­
ment.
There’s no question her© that all of thee© Commis­
sioners meat the statutory qualifications,

And when Mr, Clagett

says that tha Commission is engaging in various forms ©f regula-»

172
felon, it doesn’t seem to ns that, supports an attack upon the
legitimacy of the Commission.

Because the allocation of the

appointive power, as between the President and the Congress, is
not designed for the protection of the public at large ©r of
taxpayers? or ©f citizens.
Of course, tb.@r@ is a *»«*
QUESTION:

Wall, since this Commission is doing

something to restrict any on© of these plaintiffs, —
ME* SPRITZER:
QUESTIONS

Indeed.

-•* then surely the plaintiffs have standing

to attack the constitutional validity of the Commission.

And

it’s not — they’re not being champions of the President?
theyire being champions,

self-appointed if you will, ©f the

Cons fcitution.
MR.. SPRITZER:

Insofar, Your Honor, as they are

claiming that any action by the Commission violates a power that
an agency can exercise, ©r that the Commission, has gene beyond
the statuta, X fully agree.
Insofar as the challenge is based solely on the
preposition that the appointments were made by the President, I
think w© have a quit© different question.

A question much like

Ex parte Levitt, in which a member of the bar sought to challenge
a Justice of this Court on the ground that the appointive
process was defectiva.
QUESTION:

I know, but the Court hasn’t done anything

173
to hira yet.
QUESTIONs

Hasn't this Commission undertaken to do

something to Senator McCarthy already?

They've made demands on

hiss of some kind.
MR, SPRITZERS

Oh, X don't question for a moment,

Your Honor, that this Commission has fmotions to perform, and
if assy of the actions which it takes, or orders which it issues,
or regulations which it promulgates are unconstitutional for
reasons apart from the question as to the allocation ©£ the
appointive power, that they can be raised,,
QUESTION s

Maw about when *—

QUESTIONs D© you think that's the only question that
Senator McCarthy could raise?

Just the power of the Commission

to ask him soma questions»
MR. SPRITZERi

He can rale a any question going to the

constitutionality of action taken by the Commission which affects

him.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Sprits®r, —

MR* SPRITZERS
QUESTIONS

Yes?

«*>•• how about Glldden

Zdanok, there

the

claim wasn1t that the Court of Appeals had mad® an improper
decision for other reason, but that a judge was sitting on it
who had no business sitting

on

it?

MR* SPRITZER; Quit® so, and I think the Court was at
pains to point out in Glidden that the provision fox* lif© tenure

174
is for th® benefit of litigent®* and that that was an exception
to the general rule of standing that a party is required only
to raise his own interests and not a claim that somebody else's
prerogatives have been impinged*
QUESTION?

Well, how about cases like United States

v» Muskrat, where they said th® original Court of Claims
couldn’t b® asked to do what it did?

That was a litigant

challenging that, wasn’t it?
MR* SPRITZERS And I think a litigant could challenge,
just as he could challenge th® failure of a judge to have life
tenure in Glld&an, th© jurisdiction of a court.
But there's no question here that the Commissioners
here meet th© statutory qualifications.

The sol© claim is that

by adopting the method ©f appointment that it did. Congress
impinged on executive prerogatives»
QUESTIONs Well, there was no question in Muskrat
that the judges of the then Court of Claims mat the statutory
qualifications, but this court, held that wasn’t enough? there
was a constitutional problem*
QUESTIONs

Why isn’t this just a claim, Mr. Spritzer,

of saying that this is a legislative body that can do some
/

/

things but/it hasn’t any jurisdiction, t© perform some of 'the
functions that are assigned to it.

And some of the functions

it doesn’t have jurisdiction to perform are being exercised
against these plaintiffs.

175
MR. SPRITZER;

Well, I certainly do not. stand,

though I think it essential to raise it since it is_ a juris­
dictional question, on the standing question alone.

And,

indeed, there are three propositions that 1 hop® to develop in
say remaining time.
The first proposition is that Article IX, Section 2,
Claus© 2, the section of the Constitution dealing with the
appointment power, is not preclusive of congressional authority
to make appointments to offices where it appears that the
function ©f those offic@rs is substantially related to a
constitutional responsibility of the Congress,
The second proposition w® hope to develop is that the
Congress has unique and pervasive responsibilities, which are
not confined solely to the passage

of legislation, in relation

to the federal electoral process.
And that leads us to the third proposition, that the
powers which have been accorded this Commission, an examination
of thorn shows that they are substantially related, or incidental
to those constitutional responsibilities of the Congress.
Xfc*s true, of course, that Article II does provide
for appointment of officers of the United States by the
President.

It then does go on, however, in the "but" clause,

with which Your Honors are familiar, to state that Congress may

by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they
think proper in the President alone, in the courts of law, or

176
in the heads of departments«
And we think it fairly implicit in that section , at
least when it is read in the light of constitutions! history
and practice and a number ©£ decisions ©f this Court# that#
though congress is not

expressly granted the same power as it

may delegat® to the heads ©£ departments or to the courts of
law, that there is implicit in it the assumption that Congress
may appoint officers when they are going to perform functions
related to congressional functions»
Indeed, Madison, who was, I suppose, the strongest
advocate of a strong executive, was very clear, that he thought
that each of the three departments should have authority to
appoint its own officers with as little interference as
practicable from the others.
QUESTION:

Under that rubric, then, the Commission «—•

Congress could constitutionally have provided that all members
of the Coiaaission would fe® selected by Congress, and that all
enforcement authority was exclusively placed in the Commission
and bypass the Attorney General.
MR. SPRITZER:

Your Honor, we do not at all agree,

and l shall come to this, with Mr. Clagett's characterization
that all enforcement power is in the Commission,

We think the

Commission's enforcement powers are vary limited, and that
almost

and that much of the enforcement power, that which is

constitutionally required certainly, to be in the executive is

17?
Ib the Attorney General under this statute*
QUESTIONt

What happens if he r@-fy.ses to carry out a

request for a prosecution from the Commission?
MR, SPRITZERS

I think tii© Attorney General has

prosecutorial discretion# as he asserted only the other day 3 as
to whether to prosecute any case which is referred to him by the
Commission,
I recognise, Your Honor# that —QUESTIONi

The language ©f the statute is ‘’shall5*#

is it not?
MR, SPRITZER*

Yes,

The language does say, on

reference -to the Commission the Attorney General shall proceed.
The Court of Appeals examined the legislative history
relating to that, and was persuaded -that despite the use of the
word "shall", which often appears where the sense is permissive
rather than mandatory, that there ' .was no intention by Congress
to take away from the Attorney General hie traditional
discretion as prosecutor.
Congress# to ray knowledge, has never done so# and
there is no intimation whatever in the legislative history that
it intended to do so in this Instance, and both the Commission
and the Attorney General are of the view that the Attorney
General retains his normal discretion,
QUESTION;

But does -she Commission retain the power

to proceed independently if the Attorney General declines?

178
MR» SPRITZERs

No»

The civil injunctive powers of

the Commission do not go to violation of the substantive limits
of the statuta»

The only power that the Commission has to seek

an injunction is when documents are not produced or reports are
not. produced.
In other words, it has the power to g© to court that
legislative committees characteristically have, that legislative
study commissions have been given, that independent regulatory
agencies exercise all the time in seeking to implement their
information-gathering function, to get data, to get reports.
QUESTION $

Do they have cease-and-desist order

authority?
MR» SPRITZER;

No.

They e®n subpoena and they ©an

go to court to get documents.
If you will refer to page 25, I believe, of this
statutory supplement, you will note expressly that under subparagraph (5) ©f the enforcement provision, the Commission may
go t© the district court to enforce the reporting and disclosure
provisions when they ar© not complied with, to get data or
information.

Just as a legislative committee could get.

h function, in other words, akin to the enforcement
of subpoena.
When you come down to subparagraph (7), which has to
do with violations of the substantive limits on contributions
and expenditures that are contained in the Criminal Code, there

179
It says that »?hen the Commission is of the view that there has
been a violation of the reporting and disclosure provisions or
©£ the violations of tine Criminal Cede# it may refer the matter
to the Attorney General who shall thereafter proceed,
QUESTION:

Well# what about deciding who is entitled

to money?
MR, SPRITZER: The certification of money for public
financing# Your Honor?
The Commission* under the public financing provisions#
has the duty of examining the submissions t© determine whether
they meet the statutory qualifications ««*
QUESTION z

And finally deciding -«

MR, SPRITZER:

■»*» and certifying then to the

Secretary of the Treasury,
QUESTION:

Or refusing to.

MR, SPRITZER:
largely ministerial,

How about a refusal?

The functions under that heading ar©

I suppose one can conceive of a refusal,

QUESTION:

If somebody is refused# it isn’t always

ministerial.
MR, SPRITZER:

1 think he would have to sask mandamus

at that point# if the Commission refused to perform, its
function,
QUESTION:

So that# in that sens®# the Commission is

enforcing the terms of the statute# and its decision is final
unless you can get mandamus.

.180

MR, SPRITZSRs

In that sense, yes4

I was speaking of enforcement, Your Honor, in the
sense that the Attorney General had raised it in his brief,
namely, whether there was some invasion or possible invasion
of the Attorney General’s prerogative to sue in court.
Of course, when it comes to criminal enforcement,
it’s perf@st.ly clear that, though the Commission may investigat®
sind bring to the attention of the Attorney General the facts
which it uncovers in the course of administering the statute,
that only the Attorney General can bring a criminal prosecution,
QUESTION;

And the "shall proceed", dees that man

proceeding? and in ray'view that is the only

in the situation

wfoere it is seeking information, t© enforce a subpoena ©r
something of that character — in any case in which the
Commission can act in its own name, there*s no question the
statute expressly provides that it may also refer to the
Attorney General?
So we’re dealing har© with this question c£ enforce"
meet* with an issue that is in no sens© ripe*

This Commission

has never brought any proceeding in any court at all to date*
And it would only arise, tills question, if the Commission did
institute a proceeding?
But I did want to attempt to develop for a moment the
reasons why I think that Congress has pervasive responsibilities
in relation to the federal electoral process*
It’s not only that Congress has the responsibility
to provide for the time, manner, and place of holding elections*
In addition, Congress, each house of Congress is the judge of
the ©lections, qualifications, rand returns of its members?
And Chief Justice Hughes, in Smiley vc Holm, in
referring to this aggregata of constitutional powers, said, and
I’d like to quota one sentence:
!2!fe cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words
,embrace authority to provide a completa code for congressional

186
elections, not only as to times ana places, but in relation to
notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of
voters t prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of
votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and risking and
publication of election returns o'1
In Classic, this Court held that those powers extend
to the primary as well as to the general election.
In Burroughs, the Court made clear that the same
implied powers that Congress has in relation to the control
and the safeguarding of congressional elections apply as well
to presidential elections.
Sc far as the presidential ©lection is concerned,
Congress also has the constitutional responsibility to judge
the qualifications of electors when there is a contest.

And

a hundred years ago in the Hayes-Tilden election, when there
was such a contest, it is notable that Congress created and
appointed, a commission t© judge the' qualifications of those
♦

electors, 'their decision to be final unless overridden by
both houses of Congress acting concurrently.
The reliance on the Powell case by appellants is
wholly misplaced.

There was no suggestion in Powell that some-

one who was guilty of fraud or of corruption had to be seated?
that wasn’t in issue in Powell.
It’s quite true that Powel1 said that Congress can’t
add to the constitutional qualifications of Members of Congress.

187
But the constitutional provision in question isn’t
restricted to qualifications, Congress is also the judge of
elections and returns; and an ©lection which is bought or
obtained by fraud is a matter within Congress's power to judge,
and it certainly is disentitling.
Turning specifically, then, fee th© aggregat® of
functions that the Commission has, functions which we think am,
all of them, related to the constitutional responsibilities of
Congress,
The main core of the Commission's job is in the area
of administering the reporting and disclosure requirements,
the function which has been performed, prior to the 1974
legislation, by legislative officers, by the Clerk of the House
and the Secretary of feli® B®nate.
In this area, the Commission is told by the statute
to develop the forms for reporting? t© make interstitial rules
for th© reporting of unusual items, such as petty cash dis­
bursements t

to provide © manual for uniform bookkeeping? to

give advisory opinions as to how filing requirements apply to
specific transactions; and to investigat©, from the information
provided and by auditing, whether there has bean compliance
with these reporting and disclosure requirements,
Now, it seems to us that all of those are intimately
related to the responsibility that Congress has in judging
elections, in judging whether fraud has been committed in the

188
electoral process.
We think it clear that Congress * s function as the
judge of elections is not confined to reviewing a case which
has already crystallised* a dispute that has already occurred#
to find out whether a particular candidate bought his office
or .gained it by fraud.
We think it plain ‘that Congress# in order to perform
these responsibilities* may impose on-going requirements#
prophylactic measures designed to discourage and deter corruptiora
and fraud before it takes place# and to uncover it before it
doss its work.
And all the legislation* from 1910 on# doss indeed
proceed on that premise.
It’s perfectly true that the earlier legislation*
.though it provided for administration and for reporting in
disclosure# proved to have vary &@riQim loopholes.

But therefs

no question that the electoral legislation for two-thirds of a
century has proceeded upon the premise that an agency created
by Congress# or legislative officers indeed designated by
Congress# might perform these responsibilities in aid of the
constitutional responsibilities of the Legislature,
fhis Court has expressed,, no doubt* 1 think perhaps
the most notable instance was the Springer case# that Congress
may delegate to an officer or an agent, the performance of
functions which will be in aid of constitutional responsibilities.

189
Though that was a, case in which the court concluded that
Congress was seeking to delegate to legislative officers purely
executive functions.
We don't think that is the case her®,
I’ve ssp©k®n of the matter of enforcement.
For a moment turning to the matter of regulations#
it seems to us that if Congress war© administering these
reporting requirements now, as it has in the past# through the
Clerk of the House and hi© staff, it would have to male® rules,
or the clerk would have to make rules,

H© was indeed authorised

to do so.
It>a inconceivable that you could have anything ilk©
fair administration ©ff this statute without making rules.
As soon as you draw up a form, you're necessarily doing some
line-drawing, however informal.
Appellants say that the making of rules is quintessenfei&lly an executive prerogative — 'that’s their phrase,

I find

it rather surprising, I would have thought that on® would have
typically described rule-making a© quasi-legislative if one
were going to affix labels.
But I don’t think you can resolve this question by
affixing labels at all.

All of the departments of government

off course adopt rules.
The real question is whether, viewing in their
totality ■, the responsibilities off Congress in relation to the’

190
electoral procsss, those functions delegated to the Commission
are reasonably related to -that task»
The Court has also said# in dealing with separation
of powers concepts in the past# that the concept is not
inflexible*

Sts main role is to prevent on® department ©f

the government from taking over the other department*
Them is no "taking over” her®»
The Court said in the Siebold case that the question
was whether a particular appointment would be inappropriate or
incongruous.

And Siebold# I would remind Your Honors# was a

case in which Congress delegated to federal judges the duty of
appointing election supervisors? and that was upheld*
1 think that goes much further than delegating t©
this agency the responsibilities that Congress has in relation
to the federal electoral process.

After all# the courts*

relation to fcfe® federal electoral process is a much narrower
on® than is the Congress's*
So far as propriety is concerned# 1 would stress# in
conclusion# that there were strong reasons persuading Congress
to create a bi-partisan agency and to dispara® the appointing
power.
The President is personally involved, as well as
officially involved# in presidential elections»

He is not

only chief of state, he is chief 'of his party, and. he may well
foe# in a given

case# a candidate for re-election.

191
If there is need for a watchdog agency, and few today
have doubt of that, then it seems to us highly appropriate that
Congress should disperse the authority to appoint the member­
ship of that watchdog agency among the three institutions of
government teat are involved in the electoral process, tee
three categoria» of officers who depend on election®
fhat is what has bean done here, and it seems to us
that Congress was justified in believing that that was an
appropriate solution»

Th@ President, of course, concurred in

teat when he signed th© legislation®

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRICE M. CLAGETT, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR» CLAGETTs

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please

til® Courts
Mr® Spritzer has skillfully argued that really all
th© enforcement powers in this statute deal with th© disclosure
provisions®

It is astonishing to me that, after what w@ said

in our Reply Brief and after the sort of obnoxious invitation
1 gave him during ray prior argument, h@ still declines to tell
us on® word about the discrepancy pointed out at pages 93 and 99
of our Reply Brief, where he is arguing that the Commission has
no rule-making power over the expenditure and contribution
provisions, and yet the Commission has already exercised

192
precisely such rule-making power explicitly*
Tills is a puzzlement at the heart of the case, that
since Mr* Spritzer won’t give you any explanation of it, I
suggest you could only resolve by looking at what the Commission
does and not by what its counsel say*

Secondly, even as to disclosure, we think the case
of Watkins ~m„ United Statesla dispositive*

Mr* Spritzer says,

©f course, wy legislative committee am g© in to subpoena
documents and subpoena witnessest yes, but only in pursuance of
a legitimate legislative purpose,
tod we say that to enforce these disclosure provisions
©B&etad not for purposes of legislative oversight, enacted notfor purposes of giving Congress continuing information about
elections, or anything of that naturo, but expressly, as Mr*
Friedman argued, to disclose information to fch® public and to
aid in enforcement of the expenditure and contribution limits.
That kind of disclosure, that kind ©£ information**
gathering, has nothing to d© with the kind of information®
gathering that Congress can enforce and administer, itself.
It is 1 a substantive provision of law, just like the Antitrust
Laws, the Tax Laws, or anything else, and Congress has no more
business administering it than it does administering those
laws *
As Justice White pointed out, of course, Congress
has also given its agent the power to administer the federal

193
subsidy provisions, and what they ar® supposed t© have to do
with, information-gathering sad legislative oversight is beyond
me*

It’s just like administering the Internal Revenue Code*
Next, as to Mr* Spritzer's argument that Powell vs*

McCormack doesn't hurt him*
In Powell vs* McCormack itself, at footnote 82 on
pag© 545 of 395 U,S«, the Court, in listing the so-called
precedents of exclusions that Speaker McCormack was there
relying on, included on® exclusion in 1925, where the Senate
refused to seat a member-elect because of improper campaign
expenditures, and one concerted effort for a similar such
exclusion in 194?«
The Court characterised these, along with the other
instances that had been presented to it, as unconstitutional
congressional exercises of exclusion power, and commented that
an unconstitutional action has been taken before, surely does
not- render that same action less unconstitutional at a later
date*
And -that is on page 546, 54? of Powell*
Now, as to the political reasons for not entrusting
the President with th© appointment power here%
Plainly, th© Constitution providas ample safeguards*
through the confirmation power, through fixed terms of office,
and the congressional setting of qualifications.
Commissioners could ba appointed for life or for 15

194
years, Ilk© the Comptroller General; they could be required to
foe retired federal judges; they could be forbidden to be
persons who held political office for X number of years»
Congress could impose any qualifications which it wished»
But how it can b© argued that instead of doing that
Congress can retain th® appointment power and the confirmation
power and th® legislative veto for itself, and then us® those
powers and use that legislative veto in the interest of incumbents
and against challengers, as they have already begun to do,
passes my understanding»
I would conclude with th® comment made by ray brother
Cox in a speech last spring.

Ha saids

The wrongs disclosed

by Watergate and the# agonies of Vietnam were produced not by
defects in th® constitutional plan, but by departures from it.
