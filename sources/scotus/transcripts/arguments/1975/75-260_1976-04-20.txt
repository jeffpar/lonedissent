MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 75-260, McDonald and Laird against Santa Fe Trail
Transportation Company et al.
Mr. Rosenb1urn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY M. ROSENBLUM, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ROSENBLUM:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
The Petitioners hare seek end have sought redress
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and under
Section 1981 of 42 United States Code, the codification of the
Section I of the

Civil Rights Act of 1866 for private racial

discrimination in employment.
In all substantial respects there is no particular
difference in this case than in the legion numbers of cases
presently pending in the Federal Districts Courts around the
country, exx.u; t that in this case, the Petitioners who seek to
redress the grievance of private discrimination based on race
ir. their ettiployroent are white»
Bar..rally ,

the two Petitioners, Mr. .McDonald and

Mr. Laird, were accused by their employer, Santa Fe, of
misappropriating company property.

Along with them stood

accused a black coworker.
As a result of the accusations, the two•Petitioners

4
were discharged,

Their black coworker was not.

Because disparate disciplinary treatment so often
smacks of illegal motive in a racial context, the Petitioners
concluded that

they had been discriminated against because of

their race and accordingly instituted an action in the Federal
District Court in the state, the Southern District of Texas,
alleging that race was a factor in their discharge.
More clearly stated, the Petitioners concluded and
urged that but for the immutable characteristics of the color
of their skin, that they would have received the favored treat­
ment accorded their black ccworker,
In many respects, this is no different than a fact
situation recently before the Court in Franks versus Bowman
where it would be,one way of describing the circumstances in
that case would be to say that the black employees had been
excluded from tic ovrr-the-road driving classification.
Another way would have been to say that the white
employees of Bowman Transportation were accorded the preference
and this is precisely and only what these Petitioners had
alleged.
The District Court dismissed the cause of action
stating that

white employee charged with misappropriating

company property and disin ssad cannot complain of racial
discrimination where a si: dli i:ly charged black employee i
not dismissed.

It also dismissed stating that Section 1981 confers
no actionable rights upon a wi.ii.te person.

The Fifth

cia.ciut.

affirmed adopting an apparent finding of the District Court
that the Petitioners had

failed to deny the allegations of the

complaint of the misappropriation on their complaint.
Nona of the Respondents — neither of the Respondents
and none of the Amicus have seriously disputed that Title VII
embraces by its language discrimination against white persons.
This is supported by all of the many EEOC decisions
which are entitled to great deference as the body charged with
the administration of the Act.

It is supported by the language

in Griggs versus Duke Power Company wherein the Court stated
that preferences whether for a majority or a minority are all
that Congress intended to proscribe and it is supported by the
1a qislative hiatory.
Assuming then that Title VII may be invoked by white
persons, we turn to the question of whether these Petitioners
have stated a claim 'under which relief can be granted.
For the purposes of this consideration„ it is not
necessary that the Court consider the color of the Petitioners'"
skin but only whether racial motivation was a factor, or race
was a factor in a framework of Section 703.A1 in their discharge
or in the discipline accorded them.

,

That, of course, is the gravamen of any Title VII or
Section .1981 employment discrimination complaint.

6

QUESTION:

This complaint could not even conceivably

or even arguably have been made — have been lodged, could it,,
if all three employees had been of the same race and two were
discharged?
MR. ROSENBLUM:

Well, the gravamen of racial disparity

would not be present, though, if there were disparity.
QUESTION:

Could it conceivably have been?

MR. ROSENBLUM:

I have thought about

do not believe that it could have been, no, sir.

it a lot and I
We do not

it is important that we point out that we do not urge that any
employer is without the right to discipline within his dis­
cretion those who commit unlawful acts and those who commit
wrongdoings within the employment of their employer.
However, what we do urge is that when an employer
discharges employees for such wrongoings, that the criteria for
such discharges must be evenly applied.

That is not to say

that you can't discipline a black person differently than a
white person.

It is to ss.v that the reason for the different

discipline cannot be founded or even touched by a racial
factor and there may be no

racial motivation between the

difference in discipline accorded the different races.
In any event, the Petitioners did allege that the
difference in discipline accorded them was because of their
race and we are told in McDonnell-Douglas versus Green as well
as other cases that an injured party, black, or white, who makes

7
such an allegation has stated a claim under Title VII.

The

fact that the Petitioners are accused of a theft should be no
impediment to such a holding.

Clearly, it was no impediment

in the McDonnell-Douglas v. Green case where the Respondent in
that case, Mr, Green, was a convicted misdemeanant and here
all we have is mere allegations of wrong-doing.
The Fifth Circuit seemed tc

ottoi its affirmation on

the fact that the District Court observed that the Petitioners
had not denied in their complaint that they were guilty of
misappropriation as alleged.
It appears to me to be fundamental error in the
proposition chat the Fifth Circuit bottomed its decision on and.
that is, for one, that the petition on its face says that the
Petitioners wore discharge.':? without cause and therefore what­
ever reasons

?ere ascribed, even though they suggest they were

contextual reasons but whatever the reason that

a.ad bean

advanced is denied by the pleading.
Secondly, and assuming arguendo that they had failed
to deny Che truth of the allegation or- the reason advanced
for the discharge on their complaint,- it really would make no
difference at all.
The Petitioners alleged and the District Court
considered in dismissing pursuant to Rule 12 B6 that the three
parties, that is, the two Petitioners and Mr. Jackson, their

b ack coworker, were equally charged and equally culpable when

8
it dismissed the decision — the petition.
The Court has again reiterated in a recent decision
treating — touching on this case that given the same oppor­
tunity, it would hold the same wav, that the failure to deny
the allegations of misappropriation take a complainant, black
or white, out of the embrace of Title VII and we submit that is
simply wrong.

and McConneII-Douglas

would allow the Petitioners to show that, for example, in this
case the reason of the discharge advanced was pretextural and
a cover-up and to a preferred treatment which is violative of
7Q3J and prohibited.
Significant to that type of showing would be that the
black was equally culpable, that the company knew of the equal
culpability and retained the black employee while discharging
the white.

On page 94 of the Appendix, the Court

says, "I am considering these men equally charged and equally

MR. ROSENBLUM:

is guilty of stealing $1.5 million from the company.

QUESTION:

I mean, to hare alleged more, that’s —

MR. ROSENBLUM:

I understand.

That was a criteria

in this case.
QUESTION:

Okay.

RChENBLUM:

In any event, we submit that

'< -c.ci irainaticn —this discrimination did not occur against a
backdrop* of a pattern of discrimination worked for hundreds of
years against white persons.

We do submit that the racial

12
preference granted, in this case a minority, violates the
standards set down in Griggs versus Duke Power and we further
submit that the allegation of theft is no impediment to the
entitlement of the Petitioners to make their proof.
We then turn to an inquiry regarding Section. 1981,
We may not stop with Title VII because, quite candidly,
Petitioners in this instance may have a timely filing probi=
under Title VII.

They don't have a problem in the Fifth

Circuit because we are advised of

in this Court,
QUESTION; I am a little puzzled by what the district
judge said at page 94 to which you referred.

In parenthesis:

he wrote,"(Phis Court assume* for present purposes that the
Negro employee had a similar work record and a similar degree
of culpability in the offense.

And then he goes on,

"This

point has received inadequate attention in the pleadings filed
by the parties and has not been briefed,”
To whom is the judge directing that observation?

Petitioners.

to both parties from ray recollection of the

But it was as

reading of the

13
record.
QUESTION:

Of course, his earlier state-merit that he

was proceeding on an assumption that they were equally culpable
and, by implication at least, quite clear implication that there
are no extenuating circumstances for one or the other would
appear to make at least the briefing, the lack of adequate
brie finer, irrelevant.
MR. ROSENBLUM:

I would think so and it would be —
?
it would make the primatationess of our case until such time
as, Mr. Justice Marshall, the company came forward and showed
that there might be differences that one person, a black mar.,
had stolen $1,24 and the white Petitioners had stolen a
million dollars worth of goods.
But the petition was dismissed on the assumption
that they were equally charged and equally culpable and had
similar work records, which is precisely what caused the
Petitioners to conclude that race was a factor in their
discharge.
In any event, if I may, with regard to Section 1901,
because that might be very vital to these Petitioners if remand
occurred, we would ask that the Court consider the briefs and
the Amicus which, have abundantly demonstrated that the
legislative history, if not the plain meaning of the statute
itself, does indeed embrace white persons.
L..ie prooiem-producing language "as is enjoyed by

14
white citizens,

we submit, and we believe we have adequately

addressed, is a quantitative yardstick by which the rights of
all citizens must be measured.

We submit that it is not

arabi guous.
In addition, the legislative history, if the Court
felt it was ambiguous, plainly support the propositions that
we advance, that white parsons may state a claim under Section
1981.
QUESTION:

Do you suppose that legislation was

enacted under — by virtue of Congress' power under the 13th
Amendment or the 14th Amendment?
MR. ROSENBLUM:

It was under the power of the 13th

Amendment but recodified subsequent,

two years’ subsequent, to

the enactment of the 14th Amendment -•
QUESTION:

The adoption of the 14th Amendment.

MB. RQSENBLUM:

— and must reflect their thinking

of the quality guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to remain
Constitutional. To give them all black construction makes them
fly in the face of it, in my opinion.
QUESTION;

Well, the 13th Amendment was concerned, of

course, with the elimination of slavery and of all of its
badges and white people wore not enslaved in this country.
MR. ROSENBLUM:

And also the protection of the

Abolitionists who were suffering at the hands of their antiAbolitionist white neighbors were directly spoken to and

15
protected by the 13th Amendment in its history.
QUESTION:

As I remember it, it was readopted after

the 14th Amendment out of an abundance of caution.
MR. ROSEN.BLUM;
QUESTION:
ment the second time.

That it be misconstrued.

And they were relying on the 14th Amend­
You can't just move the 14th out.

MR. RGSENBLUM;

I couldn't agree more and to give it

an all-black construction flies in the face of the 14th
Amendment.
My time is running short and I am trying to reserve
some of it.
I can see and fathom no compelling state or govern­
mental, in this case, interest in hitting the construction of
Section 1981 that would exclude white persons.

Beyond that, I

would ask the Court not be troubled by the absence of a back­
ground of racial discrimination against

whites.

It is perhaps

too simple a statement to make, but simply true, that had the
Petitioners here been black, neither of the lower courts would
have had any trouble finding the cause of action.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. STANLEY POTTINGER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF U.S., AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. POTTINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it pleaso

16
the Court:
In the view of the United States, the central issue
in the case is both basic and uncomplicated and that is,, should
a person, any person, who alleges that he or she has been the
victim of racial discrimination in employment, have an oppor­
tunity to have those allegations be heard and tested in the
atmosphere of an evidentiary hearing?
We think the answer to this question is yes, both as
to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section IS 31,
It seems to us that the courts below have misunder­
stood,

particularly in light of the question raised by

Mr- Justice Powell
allegation,

or, Mr. Justice Stewart — that the

the mere facial allegation of some form of wrong­

doing, in this case theft, could supercede an allegation of
raci a 1 di s cr i min ati ori.
Simply put, we believe that MeDonne11-Doug1as and the
Griggs decision make clear that that particular allegation must
be tested beyond the face of the pleadings and that to rely
upon it outside the pleadings — and, indeed, there was no
summary judgment motion in this case — is a mistake because it
assumes a burden that should be shifted at least in some
evidentiary fashion to the employer.

In thei McDonnell case

the McDonne11-Douglas <C3.30 p

the Court sa t a four-prong test in that case stating that if a
person made Out a prima facie case of racial discriminat.:!on by

17
being a member of a minority group, by having been qualified
for the job but rejected, and by having others accepted for the
position, the burden didn't shift and in some evidentiary
fashion,

those allegations would have to ba tested.
We believe that the same essential ingredients are

in this case, even though the Complainants were white because
in this particular case they have met the burden of the first
test of McDonne11-bouglas by indicating that not only was
racial discrimination practiced, but that three people, two of
which were white, one of which was black, similarly situated,
were, indeed, of equal culpability on the face of the pleadings.
Mow, v.-a would concur with the implication of Justice
Marshall's question that should, upon an evidentiary hearing,
facts be developed that would indicate a greater culpability
or a different culpability on the part of the white complainant
as opposed to the black that those factors, assuming they were
not racial in nature, ought to be able to be controlling
factors.

We don’t disagree with that but on the course of the

pleadings, on the face of the pleadings, those allegations
simply do not appear and to dismiss the case entirely simply
because of an alleged lack of standing, we believe makes a
grose error and is a basic misconstruction of Griggs and
McDonnel1-Douglas,
With regard to the 1911 claim, it is our view that
•ena x.-jth Amendment in answer to the questions presented here is

18
an adequate basis for the statute and that the reenactment of
the statute subsequent to the passage of the 14th Amendment
does impart a sense of equal protection concept which is not a
racialiy-preferential concept into the statute itself.
The 13th Amendment on the face of it is not a
racially-preferentia! statute.

As Senator Trumbull said, who

was one of the authors of the statute, the statute was passed
to protect those who needed the benefits of it and clearly, in
1866, that was the black race and to protect freedraen after
that through the passage of the 1866 statute but never on the
face of the statute nor in the legislative history surrounding
its passage did the debate suppose that it was only for black
persons„
Indeed, there is a great deal, of legislative history
that made clear that in eliminating all badges of slavery and
in insuring no involuntary servitude, there were effects of the
institution of slavery that might go over to adversely effect
whites and thereby protect them.
Ir. other words, the statement was made that all
discrimination between blacks and whites should be eliminated
and that was the purpose of the 13th Amendment.
This position was also adopted, I think to a lesser
extent, under the 14th Amendment in an 1897 case in which the
Court stated that the implications of the Equal Protection
Clause under the 14th Amendment had a gloss on the IS81 statute.

19

We think, in other words, that what has happened in
this case is that the Court has misconstrued the nature of the
allegation of theft at too early a stage, at least, before it
could be clearly developed in evidentiary hearing.
In effect, what the Court has also done — and this
is partially out of having the benefit of Respondents' briefings
is virtually to invite us to believe that racial discrimination
did play a part in this case.

For in the case, not only do the

allegations make clear that the Complainants in this case and
Mr. Jackson, the black, were equally culpable as a matter of
allegation but that in addition to that there were no other
factors presented.
In addition to chafe, in the Respondents' brief they
acknowledged that — at page 1

that by definition it - ■ in

this case, affirmative action — involves at least some measure
of preference or advantage for blacks and other racial minor­
ities in connection with employment decisions and they go on,
at least in a hypothetical fashion, to suggest that as an
abstract idea, perhaps every employment or personnel decision
should be colorblind, but this is a practical world and few
parts of it are more practical than employment decisions.
We submit that absolute racial equality under every
conceivable circumstance would be counterproductive and,
finally, at poge 16, they invite us to assume racial discriiaincr,:;on may have played a factor further by saying that,

20
' Assuming for the moment that the local manager had .oeen
influenced to some slight degree by Mr. Jacksonfs race, perhaps
thinking to himself, ’Jackson's black.

All things considered,

we 11 give hi:a a break,’ we cannot believe that we thus ran
afoul of the intent of Congress expressed in Title VII.
But to assume that those positions, if, indeed, they
were developed upon an evidentiary hearing, to bear oat the
positions would, indeed, be to assume that the statement by
the Court in Griggs was wrong, in which the Court, said that
the discriminatory preference for any croup, minority or
majority, is precisely and only what the Congress has pres­
cribed ,

So our strong belief is that the case does not reach

the questions of what constitutes affirmative action,
especially since it compares individuals in this particular
case, not groups or classes of protected persons but in that
context, an evidentiary hearing must be granted in order to
develop those facts.
Thank you,

Court.

You will notice there that the Petitioners allege that

there was an investigation.
They next go on to allege that, as a result of that
investigation they were discharged but their black coworker,
Mr. Jackson, was not.
I submit to you that that complaint — and, after
all, we must bear in mind that this was the complaint which

black was guilty of second-degree burglary but decides that
because the black is a black, we won't fire him.
Now, they are not equally culpable and yet that is a
decision based on race, is it not?
MR. NIEBANK:

It is certainly a decision affected

by race and as I'll get to in a moment; well, we’ll

turn to i

right now, the —
QUESTION:

Before you move on, I am looking at the

paragraph that precedes the one that had been commented on.
This is paragraph B on 38 which states that all three of these
individuals wore charged jointly and severally with the same
offensa.

How do you square that with your argument ~~
MR•, NIEBANK.:

Ihn sorry, Mr, Justice, look at 3.

were all charged jointly and severally —"

MR. HIEBANK;
QUESTION;

But the unspoken conclusion —

Excuse me.

Well?

25
MR. NIEBANK:

The unspoken conclusion is that they

were all three found guilty and, in fact, that is not alleged.
But
QUESTION:

That is for the trial of the case, isn't

it?
MR. NIEBANK:
QUESTION:

Well, if you can get that far.

You can't resolve that on the pleadings.

MR. NIEBANK:

But what I. am suggesting is that

absent that, the complaint was properly dismissed.
QUESTION:

To

But even it

make that wash, you have got to say,

this does net allege racial discriminatory motivation.
QUESTION:

And, Mr. Niebank, in paragraph A, it

certainly says that Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged
because of their race.
MR. NIEBANK:

That is what they allege, yes.

Now, as was adverted to earlier, in a subsequent case,
Judge Sue had occasion to comment on his decision in McDonald
and Laird in Spe.es v. C. Lto was decided on the 29th of
January and it: that case he was talking about Laird and
McDonald.

He said in that case, "This Court could find no

allegation of racial discrimination on the face of the corapplaint," so that is — pardon me
QUESTION:

Well, do you say his reference there was

to this complaint that we have just been reading to you?
MR. NIEBANK:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

26
QUESTION:

Well- then, we have to read the complaint

and determine whether that is correct,
MR. NIEBANK:

Well, in view of the fact that the

motion to dismiss this complaint was granted, I think it is
incumbent on this Court to read the complaint.
QUESTION:

And we must read it favorably to the

opponent.
MR. NIEBANK:

Most favorably to the Petitioners,

correct.
QUESTION: > Well, what do you suggest as a hypothesis
that they needed to allege here to survive the motion which is
not alleged?
MR. NIEBANK:

Wall,, I believe they should have or

should be required to allege- that they were equally culpable

and this is in order to sustain the conclusion that there was
disparate disciplinary treatment, that they were

the black

man was just as guilty as they were but he wasn't fired and
they were.
QUESTION:

Well, fairly — can't

you read this

oo.:iplaint fairly as stating they engaged in a joint enterprise
as b'r. Justice Powell has just pointed out, that they all did
the same thingt as described in detail?
UR.- NIEBANK;

Well, the point that- came up before

was that they were charged jointly with this theft.

QuESilOU;

ne are only in the allegation stages here

27
HR. NIEBANK:

I know, but that is the point at which

they have got to file a complaint which states the cause of
action and the courts below found that they did not and I think
properly so.
QUESTION:

But they were pleading under the federal

rules, Mr. Niebank, not under Chitting*s rules.
MR. NIEBANK:

That, is correct, Mr. Justice, but still

given notice pleading we are entitled, I believe, to more
specificity than they have here.
If, however, you go ahead and assume, as the District
Court did, that they were, in fact, similarly situated, still
we believe that the court properly dismissed the claim for
failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted
under Title VII because -. c.nd here I would refer the Court —
QUESTION:

You filed a full answer.

MR. NIEBANK:
QUESTION:

You filed a full answer.

MR. NIEBANK:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Yus, air, we did.

And in the answer you didn't volunteer

any fact that one of them was guilty and the other one wasn't,
did you?
MR. NIEBANK:

Well, in the answer, in the answer to

the complaint -QUESTION:

.
Did you?

MR, NIEBANK:

You didn’t.

Nof we said that we denied that

28
Jackson was even charged.

In fact* we denied that Laird was

discharged for his participation in the theft.

We said in our

answer that he was discharged because he was a poor supervisor*
and had violated company rules.
QUESTION:

But —

Well, then, the issue is joined, isn't it?

The issue is joined and you are ready to go to trial.
MR. NIEBANK:
in the district court

Except that they were still required
to state a claim upon which relief

could be granted in their complaint, even though we had filed
the answer, we had filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12B6.
Now, if you assume that they were, in fact, similarly
situated, still we believe that the complaint was properly
dismissed.
Here, referring to Me Donne11-Douglas against Green,
we are going to talk about the essentials of a cause of action
in a case of this kind.
The Plaintiffs — or the Petitioners in this case —
to the extent they allege that they had been discharged for
theft, they, in effect, met the burden which might otherwise
be placed upon us of coming back with our answer and saying
they were dismissed for theft and then the burden, would shift
back to them.
They

even though we had answered to that effect

they met our burden and then i t was incumbent upon them to
allege something more and that something might have been a

29

pattern in practice, pretext.

They at one point did allege

pattern in practice but they abandoned that when it became
obvious that they could never make it stick and you have heard
some talk today about pretext»

Well, that is an afterthought

because they never alleged pretext in the complaint that the
theft was a pretext to discharge them because of their race.
Also, I want to emphasize that our action in this
case grew out of an exercise of management's discretion in
discipline.

How, management must have a considerable degree

of discretion in administrative discipline the same way courts
do in administering sentences in criminal cases.
What the Petitioners would have this Court do is say
that there must be a uniform sentence no matter what when you
have got three people involved in the same transaction.
I submit to you that that is not so, that management
has a right to be lenient if it chooses and that it would not
thereby run afoul of the law.
I'd like to touch very briefly on the 1981 point
which the court below held that whites are not entitled to
claim that relief and there it seems to me that the parties
are not starting at the right point.

I think we have to start

with the 13th Amendment which, cf course was to — the purpose
of which was to abolish slavery and Section 1981 being part of
the Civil Rights Act of .1366 was intended to implement that
and if you read it, HA1X persons shall enjoy the same rights

30
as white citizensif you read it to mean,

"All whites shall

have the same rights as white citizens," I submit that that is
redundant.
Now, there is legislative history, of course, on
both sides and the courts are divided but we believe that the
bast reading is one which would restrict 1981 relief to blacks
and other minorities,.
If 198.1 is read to confer or to require — or to
confer a cause of action on whites, then you are going to open
the gates to suits such as the Sears, Roebuck case, Hollander
against Sears, Roebuck in which Sears set up a summer intern­
ship program for the benefit of blacks and a young man applied
and was, of course, rejected so he sued»
Now, that will have a very serious impact on
affirmative action programs w! vUfa are the policy of the United
States intended to assist the black men and other minorities.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRIS DIXIE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL 908
MR. DIXIE:

If the Court please;

Both lower courts assumed that the two people

the

three people were guilty of theft and he had gone into various
allegations

i pretrial hearings and it was before the district

court that the theft concerned 60 cases of anti-freeze then and
there in transit in the possession of a common carrier-

That

is a crime under state law, a felony, and it is also a crime
under federal law.
Both courts held that if it is serious crime, it is
outside of the purview of Title VII.
I would like to refer this Court to a line of cases
by the lower courts that hold that under the National Labor
Relations Act, if serious theft on the job is involved, the
entire case is outside of -the purview, even if the discharge
was motivated by prohibited reasons.

Please see NLRB versus

Magnusson, 523 Federal 2nd 643 which collates the decisions of
seven circuits to the same effect.
I mention this point because in most of the briefs
that is the rejected brief.

The point is made that you do the

s.’nu thing under this statute that we do under the Labor Act
because it was a model for this statute, Title VII and I want
the Court to please examine this line of cases.
The theory of the lower courts is that when you get
dc m to the question of serious theft on the job, it does not
effectuate the purposes of the statute and it also demeans the
court to reinstate .and provide back pay for someone who is
demonstrated to be guilty of that kind of conduct.
So here the: Cor t must decide, I think, whether in
your judgment it is rejessary to provide equality in

32
punishment for serious theft on the job as a means of effective
enforcement of Title VII or whether, as was done under the
Labor Act, you. leave a theft outside the purview of the
statute.
Now, that is what this Court did in the ancient case
of Fansteel, which was cited in McDonnell-Douglas versus Green.
In Fanst.ee]., the sit-down strikers were not rein­
stated even though many sit-down strikers were reinstated.

The

Supreme Court said, that kind of conduct puts them beyond the
purview of the statute and that is what we think is the issue
in this case.
Under 1981, we join issue with the other parties.
We say that the face of the statute does not accommodate this
case
QUESTION:

What would you say if an employer found

his business falling off?

He wasn't organi zedSand he was going

to have to cur down ten employees and he discharged ten white
employees and they brought a suit alleging that they were
discharged because of their race.
MR

DIXIE:

It would seem to me that they have an

ideal cause of action.

No one has disputed in this case that

Title VII appl ies and protects the white people.

As a matter

White people can file charges before EEOC.

QUESTION:

And if the black were the Plaintiff here

making the same allegations as the white person was making here,
you would be arguing the same way.
MR. DIXIE:

Certainly.

All races, colors, national

origins, religions and sexes have a cause of action under
Title VII and in case there is a misunderstanding in the public,
and I think there may be, this seems to ba ar ide*“ occasion
for the Court to speak loud and clear on

I think we have to recognize that

but the remedy for that is not to stretch 1981, it is to point
out the fact that they have idealprotection under Title

VII,

in the same forum and under the same substantive and procedural
rules.
Please let me go to 1981
QUESTION:
MR. DIXIE:

.

All right, you are going to 1981?
Sight new.

Your Honor, the 1886 Act as it was passed provided

34
first, all citizens born here are citizens and second, all
citizens shall possess certain rights to the same degree as
white citizens.
Now, isn't it interesting that no one on the other
side,no brief comes to grip with that phrase, "same rights as
are enjoyed by white citizens”?
Now, in "taking that language, Congress thus estab­
lished the rights possessed by white citizens as the yardstick
for measuring the rights of all citizens and this case does not
fit the statute for the same reason that they require the
court to say now that we are going to take the yardstick of
black citizens in a single, isolated episode of theft to pro­
vide a converse or a reciprocal cause of action for

white

people„
How, the legislative history does not require that
or does not even permit it, as we see it.
Now, do not confuse Jonas versus ilfred MayerIn
statute supported the Plaintiffs
and the inquiry of the court was whether there was something in
the legislative history that required the court to gc contrary
to the face of the statute, but in this case, the face of the
rir.brt..' supports the Saspondent and the burden is heavier.
QUESTIONi
with you, sir?

Mr. Dixie, may I test that proposition

Supposing a community had an ordinance that

surd white citizens shall be' permitted to ride in the front of

35
the bus.

Black citizens shall not be permitted to ride in the

front of the bus and neither shall people named "Dixie."
Now, would Mr. Dixie have a cause of action?
MR. DIXIEs
QUESTION:
MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, X think all persons —■
Even though he was white.
All persons, yes.

I really think so.

So that it would be conceivable for a

.white person to have a cause of action.
MR. DIXIE:

I think that is right and the statute

even covers white aliens because alienage is a disability that
Congress wanted to overcome but the ultimate thing we must get
to in this cane if we are going to be true to what reconstruc­
tion Congress enacted is, the adoption of a yardstick of white
citizens' rights, whatever they are, and the granting of those
rights to all citizens and that is the place where the statute
does not fit the case and, vice-versa*
QUESTION:

Well, if you decide that white citizens

generally have a certain right and then a certain white
citizen is denied it, why doesn't he have a cause of action?
MR. DIXIE:

They are not asking for' the rights of

••hitu citi,vrj in this case.

They would have such an insur­

mountable burden of proof there that it would be futile to fib
such a case.

Why, these Plaintiffs are not asking for the

rights of white citizens.

These Plaintiffs are asking for the

rights of black citizens and they are asking the Court to

36

perform plastic surgery upon the statute and to do something
that the Reconstruction Congress did not
QUESTION:

and they ask —

Isn't the right, Mr. Dixie, involved here,

the right not to be discriminated against on account of race,
which most whites had in 1866 that maybe some whites don't have.
MR. DIXIE:
your Honor.

Well, that is not what is involved here,

In the post-slavery period in the implementation

of the 13th Amendment, Congress was interested in elevating and
protecting the position of freed men.

They were not interested

in protecting the rights of white people.
It is not incumbent on Congress to come up with a
solution that is perfectly rectangular or perfectly square in
every sifcuati m, but Congress may address itself to the evils
at hand and ii this connection, I would like to cite Williams.
versus Lee Optical Company, the 1955 terra of Court, 348 U.S.
483, which collated all the cases up to that time and has been
cited

many times by this Court for the proposition that

Congress may address itself to the evil that it perceives and
that Congress understood that the white population had their
feat on the necks of the black population and what they were
trying to do was to elevate all non-whites, if you please, to
fciie status cf whites in each state, whatever that status was
and so, in asking for this plastic surgery, they do not give *—
they do not; reach, I don't believe the legislative history, but
I ara not going to burden you with that except to say to your

37
Honors that the legislative history, after the bill took its
final form — not the early stages of it -- made a clear
demonstration that the Senators and the Congressmen understood
the structure and thrust of this statute is to provide relief
for the freed men and the deprived people to elevate them to
the level of white citizens.
They understood that.

They articulated that.

President Johnson said that in his veto message and Senator
Trumbull, the principal sponsor of the bill, said that after
President Johnson vetoed.
President Johnson said, "This thing is discriminatory,
.Seritor Trumbull said, "With what truth can this be
said of a bill, which declares that the civil rights and
punishments of all races including, of course, the colored,
shall be the same as those of white persons." •
He l.idn't say that this gives a cause of action to
white people, too.
Mtw, the last th Ing I want to say to the Court
because I observed —
QUESTION:
MFC. DIXIE:
QUESTION:

Mr. Dixie —
Sir'?
Mr. Dixie, is it your submission that no

white person can make out a cause of action under this section
even though he asserts he was denied the rights accorded to
white people?

33

MR. DIXIE:

No, that is not my position because there

are lots of white people as we speak.

White people under the

statute means something else.
For example, there is no doubt in my mind that
Mexiean-Amerleans can reach under this statute.

There is a

very, very lengthy I<aw Review article in'63 California Lax?
Review demonstrating why they are an identifiable ethnic group.
QUESTION:

Well, hew about a straight Caucasian.

Can he ever make out a claim simply showing that he isn't being
given the right that "white people” are
MR. DIXIE:

being given?

Well, can whoever make out a claim, your

Honor?
QUESTION:

A straight Caucasian ox a not-so-straight

Caucasian?
[Laughter.i
MR. DIXIE:

A straight Caucasian.

Well, I don’t

know exactly what a straight Caucasian is but I believe that
theoretically he could.

I just believe he would have a terrible

burden of proof and that that question, while theoretically
penetrating, is not a very serious practical problem, your
Honor.

But there are other groups who are put upon in this

nation who could possibly invoke the rights of nonwhites.
in every case., they must reach for the yardstick of white
people.
Mow, no one in 'his case has given the Court any

But

39
reason why you should perform this plastic surgery.
Title VII is entirely adequate in the employment
field.

No one has said/'What is the use of doing this?”except

the brief filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and upon my
word, they say right in there what we are worried about, and
that is, that this kind of a cause of action invested in white
persons under 1981 becomes a useful tool to contest against
affirmative action programs which might be undertaken in the
implementation

of Title VII and that if the red light doesn't

go on, I'll give you an illustration.
In Griggs versos Puke Power Company , this Court held
that tests which disproportionately affect black people are not
lawful unless they are job-related but iff they are job-related,
the tests can be as difficult as they need to be.
Let us suppose an employer determines that his tests
are not lawful and he gets rid of them.
other departments,

He transfers blacks to

lie gives them plant-wide seniority for a.

remedial purpose and he has complied with Title VII.

What

stops a white worker from suing under 1981 to say that they
have applied a different standard to a black than they do to
me.

That black didn't have to pass that test.

That black now

has plantwide seniority and I have been fighting for 20 years
to get plantwide seniority.
QUESTION:

Well, he might not even want

He would probably just do it under Title VII

MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:
MR. DIXIE:

Certainly, but if he wants to —
Which you agree he could do.
If he wants to stay away from the Equity

Court and if he wants to invoke a jury, he will sue under 1981
and he will present issues of fact for the determination of a
jury in a different forum under a different statute of limita­
tions, your Honor, and have a jury pass upon whether or not
that test which was discarded by the employer was in fact jobrelated or non-job-related.
Well, my time is up.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rosenblum, you have a

minute or two left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY M. ROSENBLUM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ROSENBLUM:

First, I would like to make the

observation that Petitioners have simply never been convicted
of any crimes, theft or otherwise.

There has been an allega­

tion that there were 26 cans of antifreeze misappropriated and
I remind the Court that in the McDonnell-Douglas. v. Green case
we had a convicted, confessed misdemeanant, so I simply reject
Mr. Dixie's proposition plus- if we talk of floodgates and a
criteria is created where the mere allegation of wrongdoing
constitutes the basis for discharge without the embrace of
Titio VII or 1981 it is likely that ten years of ameliorating
judicial interpretation of Title VII will go out the window.
This is precisely what happened in hundreds of casea
upon which Title VII claims were based.
Hr. Dixie asks fer reasons why we should have 1981
and why we should only worry about two people here.
One of the reasons is precisely that, that these
Petitioners and, in particular, Mr. Laird, never — he never
filed a Title VII charge at the EEOC so it is altogether
possible depending on constructions placed on his failure to
file that 1981 is his only avenue of relief.
Furthermore, many hypothetic&ls have been tossed

44
around.

If it turned out, for example, that this employer had

less than 15 employees, 1981 is a necessary vehicle for
redeeming discrimination if it occurs whether preferences eire
for the majority or the minority.
We have heard much of the legislative history.

I

don’t intend to burden the Court overly but can't resist
reading from the brief of the Respondent prepared by —
