2.S2.CEEDING £
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in Francis against Henderson.
Mrs. Rutledge.
OHM) ARGUMENT OF MRS. BARBARA B. RUTLEDGE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MRS. RUTLEDGE:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

The State of Louisiana takas th® position that

undsr th® ruling of Pavia v. United States and the facts of
this case, petitioner has waived his right to attack th© grand
jury.
First petitioner urges that this Court should not
apply th® ruling of Davis y. United States to a Stata prisoner.
Th® Stat® respectfully submits that this is th® ruling which
should be applied, that there is no reason or basis not to
apply this to Stat® as well as Federal prisons,
QUESTIONs

Of course, Davis was not a constitutional

decision, was it?
MRS. RUTLEDGE:

No, it was undiir the rule, Federal

rule.
QUESTION:

But I gather Louisiana, suggests that

there is a constitutional ©lament to th® Davis rule that
ought, to b® applied in this case'?
MRS. RUTLEDGE:

Yes, that by due process, the

Stat® prisoner under Louisiana law waived his right and that he

23

had a fair and impartial trial.
QUESTIONS

Now, the rul® applied by the Circuit Court

here was in the absence of a showing of prejudice, was it not?
MRS. RUTLEDGES.
QUESTION;

That's right.

That's not, is it, th© Davis rule?

MRS. RUTLEDGE:

In th® Pavia cas© this Court stated

that actual prejudice must b© shown in order to obtain relief
from a statutorily provided waiver for failure to assert it in
a timely manner.

However, even if this Court would not

conclude that actual prejudice need be shown, as th© Fifth
Circuit did, th© State respectfully submits that there likewise
was no showing of cans® in this case.
As far as applying th© rule of Davis v. United States
th® logic that applies there applies with equal force to
a State prisoner.

This Court observed in Pavia v. United States

if time limits for attacking the jury composition ar© followed,
inquiry into alleged effects may b© concluded, and if necessary
cured, before th® court, th® witnesses, and the parties have
gone to the burden and th® ©spans© of a trial.

If defendants

were allowed to flout its time limitations,on th© other hand,
th@r© would b® little incentive to comply with its terms when

a successful attack might simply result in a new indictment
prior to ferial.

Strong tactical considerations would militate

in favor of delaying th© raising of th® claim in hop© of
acquittal with th® thought if those hopes did not materialize,

24

the claim could foe used to upset an otherwise valid conviction
at a time when reprosecution might well foe difficult.

That

reasoning applies in Federal or State prosecutions.
If this Court should accept petitioner"s position#
I don't b®@ any reason why there would ever have to be an
attempt to attack a grand jury# because under the facts of
this case# all the defense counsel would have to saj is he
believed it would fo© wasted effort.
In Henry v, Mississippi this Court showed that it
/

will look to see if a procedural rul® serves a legitimate
State interest# and it is urged -that the rul© to attack a
grand jury prior to trial serves the interest of time and
expense of court and witnesses„
This Court stated in Cochran v. United States

plainly

the interest in finality is the same with regard to bote
Federal and State prisoners.

And that’s what the State is

seeking.
Moreover# this Court observed in Cochran

Federal

prisoners are no less entitled to such consideration than a
State prisoner.

There is no reason to treat Federal trial

errors as lass destructive of constitutional guarantees than
State trial error, nor to give greater conclusive effects
to procedural defaults by Federal defendants than to similar
defaults by States,,
be applied

The State simply asks . that the converse

25
In an address to the Conference of Chief Justices
in 1964 Mr. Justice Brennan observed, KXf the States afford
prisoners full and fair opportunity on direct or collateral
review to raise and prosecute th@ir Federal constitutional
claims as Federal habeas corpus affords, then fch© Federal
habeas corpus courts will have no need to intervene in the
supervision of State criminal justice.s
Th© State is asking that they b© afforded the same
direct and collateral review as fch© Federal prisoner, but that

no harsher rule ba applied.
Accepting fch® contention that the standards of Davis
v» United States

should b® applied, w® observe that th©

Fifth Circuit said that actual prejudice must be shown.
• 7 r.' \ /'■■■■

,

.

They

.

found that th© Louisiana rule did not make any exception for
waiver, but they engrafted a provision that there should be
a showing of actual prejudice.

It submitted that the Fifth

Circuit was eminently correct and that it is not unfair if you
find that this is a harsher rule than Davis to apply it since
this statute in Louisiana was silent.
However, in th© alternative, if this Court finds
that something less was meant by causa, we urge that this Court
find that there has b@®n no showing of causa in this ease.
It was observed yesterday that the isssu© here
basically is was th@r© a showing of incompetence by counsel
to justify a showing of cause for fch© waiver of th© attack on

26
the grand jury.
X submit that the record supports a finding
a
that thars was/most competent and able attorney in this case.
Petitioner urges first of all that Chief Counsel
Mr. Tureaud was not a capable attorney in that he had not
triod a capital - c&s© in 15 years and his basic practice had
turned away from th® criminal practice.
X submit that this is .no showing of an incompetent
attorney.

Thor® is nothing in this record that I can point to

tc show Mr. Tureaud's competence as an efficient, hard­
working attorney, but on th.® other hand, X say —
QUESTIONS

There is something.

H® failed, to file a

motion.
MSS. RUTLEDGE:

I don’t believe that a failure to

file a motion in itself without something more can be said
to be shown to be cause to establish that this was an
incompetent attorney.
QUESTION:

But it is something.

MBS. RUTLEDGE:

It's something.

It may be that it

shows ‘chat ha mad® a well-reasoned conclusion.
QUESTION:

I suppose there might fe© circumstances

where you would agree that any parson who didn't file such a
motion would be a fool.
MRS. RUTLEDGEs

There could be circumstances, that's

right, but I don't believe it's reflected in this record at
all.

21
QUESTIONS

Thera is just a failure of proof in this

respect.
MRS, RUTLEDGEs

Thar® is a failure of proof.

I think

the record shows that at this time there w@r@ being attacks
mad® on the grand jury.

Thor® were blacks on the grand jury

that indicted this petitioner.

Ther® w@re blacks in the petit

jury venire.
QUESTIONS

Was there over any question raised in

these proceedings about the petit jury?
MRS. RUTLEDGSs

In the low©r courts?

Nop there has

not been.
QUESTIONs

And none in the habeas proceeding.

MRS. RUTLEDGE;

No, the attack is on the grand jury,

and there were blacks on tin® jury venire.

This Court is aware

that th@r® were attacks on this grand jury proceeding in
Louisiana, and it was found to be validly constituted grand
juries and writs of certiorari were denied by this ■—
QUESTION s

This trial was in N@w Orleans, was it?

MRS. RUTLEDGE s
QUESTION;

Yes.

Was there anything in the record to indi-

cate that objections to the composition of the grand jury in
other cases had been mad© in New Orleans Parish?
■

MRS. RUTLEDGE:

Yes*

In the district court the

records were submitted of Stately.. Barksdale, State v.
Simpson.

28

QUESTIONS

Did they also involve'black accused?

MRS. RUTLEDGE;
QUESTION;

Yes.

I suppose there are certain kinds of

motions in criminal c&sma that an experienced criminal lawyer
might feel hm would hav© a good chance of winning, tut that
it might not materially advance his client's cans© ether than
to delay the prosecution a little bit.
MRS. RUTLEDGEs

It could wall be.

Attorneys have

t© make that decision throughout this trial.
QUESTION;

You are suggesting perhaps this is a

matter of trial strategy.
MRS. RUTLEDGE;
QUESTION;

Yes, I think it was.

That inference as well as —

MRS. RUTLEDGE;

X think it was.

felt it would he wasted effort.

His words were he

2 think that can b€

concluded that he did not think perhaps that it would have
been a valid motion. A motion to quash was filed in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, valid or not, it might net have

helped his client's cause any to make such a motion.
MRS. RUTLEDGE;

That's right.

That can be an

intelligent waiver of motions, and it c@rta.inly does not
reflect incompetence of counsel.

And as I stated, a. motion

to quash was filed although it was on other grounds.
And in this respect, I think the fact that other
motions were filed demonstrates -that these attorney© were

29
actively participating and working for the benefit of their
client.

These were not. incompetent counsel.
Petitioner strongly attacks the competence of Mr.

Tureaud.

He does not quite as strongly attack the competence

of Mr. Amadee because he cannot say that Mr. Amadee was not
completely familiar with the criminal law.
QUESTION:

Not only that, I gather Mr. Amadee cans

into the case at the time of trial rather than pretrial.
MRS. RUTLEDGE:

I think that* s what counsel would

lead you to believe, but if you read the testimony of the
transcript of the hearing, they asked Mr. Amadee approximately
how long was it before ~~
QUESTION:

What page are you reading from?

MRS. RUTLEDGE:

I am reading from the supplemental

appendix in the Court of Appeals, page 54.

QUESTION:

Do you have the page---

MRS. RUTLEDGE:

Mb., I don't,

MR. ROGOW: X think it’s, in the original appendix
in this Court.

lb - ■

QUESTION;

You don’t know the page.

QUESTION:

Well, there is some colloquy baginning on

petitionervs

riaf, but on c can assume chat perhaps

he —~
!

MR. ROGOW: It’s pages 25 through 27, I think
Rutledge is.referring to, in the appendix in this Court.

Mrs.

30

QUESTION:

Right.

MRS. RUTLEDGE:

And they asked Mr. Amadee approximately

how long was it before the time of trial that you were incor­
porated with co-counsel, Mr. Tureaud?
?!Two or three months, I am not positive.
three months, two or three months.

Two ox-

I’m saying I am not

positive."
QUESTION:

Wasn't there some evidence that there was

a division of responsibility between .Mr. Tureaud and Mr.
Amadee?
MRS. RUTLEDGE:

Also in the transcript he said he

considered Mr. Tureaud was petitioner’s chief counsel.

However,

ha also said, "I was Francis" lawyer." There was no denial
of that fact.
He was asked, "Were you co-counsel?"
"Yes.

All the decisions were joint decisions."

QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking there was a six-

year delay between the time of the tria3 in Orleans Parish
and the State habeas proceeding from which most of this
testimony comes?
MRS-. RUTLEDGE:

You are correct.

And I think the

reason that you might say Mr. Tureaud is considered the chief
counsel is because the State district judge designated only
one counsel should do the cross-examination and the presentation
of the defense's case.

But I think the testimony of Mr.

31
Amadee shows that they 'were•joint counsel»

He said all

decisions were jointly made.
Also yesterday petitioner urged that there was a
showing of incompetence because the motion to suppress «aj
denied and there was no bill reserved.
transcriptf Mr. Amadee said,

If you read the

There is no transcript of the

trial of the case, but to the best of his recollection he
did file a bill of exceptions which was his general procedure.
Also, it points out that the State in this case
was seeking nothing less than a death sentence.
defendant received life.

The

So his counsel fought actively

against the State for the death penalty and were effective
in that respect.
QUESTION:

When you were making the points a

little earlier with reference to the appendix, were you
referring to page 26 where Mr. Amadee answered that the
motions hadn’t been made, the motion to quash, because Mr.
Tureaud. did not want to do it because there were blacks on
the grand jury and the petit jury panel and that he had his
own ideas about those things.
MBS. RUTLEDGE:

That’s correct.

Also, counsel pointed out yesterday as an example of
the ineffectiveness of counsel that they took no appeal, and
he made the statement that that’s because they were courtappointed counsel and they didn’t want to be hung with the

32
case for a lengthy time.
QUESTION;

I think we went beyond that, that he had

not gotten the death penalty, and they thought he had coma
off rather well without getting the death penalty.
MRS. RUTLEDGE;

That's correct.

It was not simply

because they did not want to be burdened with tills case.
When you read the transcript, it shows that they made a
decision, they talked to -the defendant, they talked to his
family, they urged him not to appeal not just because they
didn't want to carry the case, because he had an armed
robbery charge pending over him which they thought they could
compromise if he did not appeal by having it not prosecuted.
They also point out in the transcript, "When we
heard the facts throughout 'the trial and as it appears to us,
we would be wasting our time as lawyers,11

This was not just

to be relieved of the burden of representing this man.

I

do not think there has been a showing in this record of
incompetence, and petitioner

strongly urges that is his

ground for cause.
Finally, if it should be concluded that something
more than causa has to be shown, if the ruling of Fay v. Noia
must apply in this case, I think it might be said that there
was a deliberate bypass in this case.
QUESTION;
his lawyers.

Not, of course, by the accused, but by

33
MRS. RUTLEDGE:
by the accused.

That’s correct.

I admit it was not

But i think—

QUESTION:'

Does the Fay v. Hoia deliberate bypass,

is that addressed to the action of the lawyers or of the
accused?
MRS. RUTLEDGE:

Of the accused, but I think a

distinction might be made because I think an accused should
be consulted-when it's a matter of waiver of appeal.

Or

perhaps he can understandingly confer with counsel when it's
maybe a waiver of a jury trial and entry of guilty plea.
But there are certain circumstances where I believe that the
waiver of the attorney must constitute -the waiver of a client.
I cannot conceive of a 16-year-old defendant making an
intelligent waiver of a motion to quash.
QUESTION;

I suppose you think that Henry v.

Mississippi supports you in that respect.
MRS. RUTLEDGE:

Well, it doesn't come out as

completely as that, but I 'think it's a logical step from there,
that there are certain points where a client could not talk
with his attorney and make an intelligent decision whether
he should waive a certain motion or not.
QUESTION:

It would be —

(Inaudible)

MRS. RUTLEDGE:

That status, ha probably wouldn’t

need an attorney.
So I would submit, even if you have to go as far as

34
f

finding you have to apply a deliberate bypass, even that was
done in this case.
\

So it is the State's position hare that under the
rule of comity, applying Davis v. United States, to bring a
case to finality, unless there is an exceptional showing by
petitioner,

it

must be held that he has waived his right

to attack a grand jury, and that there has not been that
showing in the case at bar.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mrs. Rutledge.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Rogow?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. ROGOW:
the Court:

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Of course our position is that the Fay v. Noia

standard is the applicable standard, and when Mrs.
QUESTION:

What about her argument that the

deliberate bypass in some instances may be attributed, to
actions of counsel?
MR. ROGOW:

That certainly is not what Fay v. Noia

stands for.
QUESTION:

And what about

Henry v. Mississippl?

I guess not.
MR. ROGOW:

I don't, think that Henry vy Mississippi

35
answers that, directly either.'
Federal habeas corpus.

But Henry, of course, permits

It leaves open the question of the

availability of Federal habeas corpus after this Court's
decision.
But I think in addressing this question of whether
or not there has been a deliberate bypass, a very interesting
point has been raised, and that is if that is the test, and
if that is the test that the bypass can be either by counsel
or by the defendant, then let us look at what tactical reason
existed for Tureaud to bypass this challenge?
The answer —
QUESTION:

What I am thinking about, there was that

sentence in Henry v. Mississippi, "Although trial strategy
adopted by counsel without prior consultation with an accused
will not where the circumstances are exceptional preclude the
accused from asserting constitutional claims, we think that
the deliberate bypass by counsel, the contemporaneous objection
rule as a part of trial strategy would have that effect in
tills case."
Doesn't that suggest that there may be deliberate
bypass where the conduct is that of counsel rather than the
accused?
MR. ROGOW:

It suggests it, but it suggests it in

the context of a trial that is going on at the moment where
a quick decision has to be made by a lawyer -—

36

QUESTION;

So it’s contemporaneous objection»

MR. ROGOWs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Mi at you have here is a failure at.

pretrial to make the objection that the statute , Louisiana
statute, said had to be made pretrial if it was to be made
at all.
MR. RQGOW:

And there would have been time in this

case to make that challenge without having to worry about
turning to consult the client during the trial itself.
I think if there is to be a line drawn about whether
or not deliberate bypass can be mads by counsel, it would
have to be drawn as a matter of trial strategy during the
trial itself when there is not time to consult with counsel.
Here we have a pretrial motion.

What tactical

reason exists for not making this pretrial motion?
QUESTION;
on page 26.

Well, we have evidence on that.

It’s

And this co-counsel said that he did not recall

whether he had discussed it with Mr. Tureaud.

He said, "I am

of the opinion he wouldn't have dons it because Mr. Tureaud
is a man who doesn’t believe in what he calls wasted effort.”
MR. RQGOW;
Justice.

What effort

And that is my point, Mr. Chief
would be wasted when a man is on trial

for his life if you use every available tactic, perhaps, to
try to save that person?
QUESTION;

That's up to the skill of the lawyer

37
frequently and his own judgment of the matter, because in the
last line on that same page, the witness, Mr. Amadee, said
he knew that these were motions made in quite a few cases and
that they were often made, so it was not a matter of overlook­
ing it.

Rather, does the record not show that it was a

matter of the judgment of the lawyer that there was no
point in making the motion?
MR. ROGOW:
shows that.

No, sir, I do not think that the record

These are the recollections of Mr. Amadee regard­

ing what Mr. Tureaud may have been thinking.
QUESTION:

This is his co-counsel, and that5s the

only evidence in the record, unless you can point to some
other.
MR. ROGOW:

The testimony in the record on page 27

which I think puts the thing in its proper light is in the
middle of page 27 Amadee saying one thing, "I came into the
case kind of late.

I came in as a trial expert to help Mr.

Tureaud to select juries and what not.
thereto was Mr. Tureaud’s business.

Things done previous

I did tell him I thought

he ought to have a bill of particulars and a Prayer for Oyer
and he did that.”
Now, -those motions were filed the very day before
trial.

I don’t understand how Mr. Amadee — he can say that

perhaps Tureaud considered it, but he certainly can’t know
what Tureaud was considering.

What we have here is a record

38
that is unrebutted in terms of Amadee saying that Tureaud
didn't do anything until the day before trial and it's what
I suggested that he do, because if we look at the record,
we see that those motions were filed the day before trial.
QUESTION;
MR. ROCQW:

What is a Prayer of Oyer?
It's a discovery kind of motion, and

it sought the statements that were made by Francis.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rogow, in my days of practice in

Arizona in the Federal Courts there was a proceeding whereby
someone who had committed a crime in another State could be
tried in Arizona upon waiver of indictment, because the
grand jury couldn't indict, because the witnesses wore also they would bring the witnesses in for the trial.
a feeling that probably still obtains.

And I have

And I don’t think

any of the members of our bar felt that they were g:.ving up
any substantial right of a defendant to waive indictment in
that situation.

He was going to get his trial and they

figured that the grand jury was probably going to indict
him..

It would take time, but that would be all they' would

gain.
MR. ROGOW;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you art;

directing yourself, I think, to the question of tactics, of
strategy, and you ar© saying there would be nothing to be
gained there.
What I am pointing to in this record is one cannot

39
draw the conlusion that nothing will be gained by attacking
the grand jury that indicted Francis.
on trial for his life.

This young boy was

The State was seeking the death

penalty.
QUESTIONS

But you have got to conclude that if

they had successfully attacked the grand jury, that something
not only that something would have been gained, but that no
reasonable lawyer could have concluded otherwise.

And isn't

it a perfectly reasonable hypothesis that if they successfully
attacked this grand jury, some other grand jury is going to
return exactly the same indictment?
MR. ROGOW:

I don't think that hypothesis is so

reasonable in tills case given the unique circumstances of
this case.

In this case ws have a unique decision to charge

made basically by the District Attorney, and the record is
clear on that.

This is the first time in the recollected

history of Orleans Parish that a person had been indicted
for felony murder where the deceased was a co-perpetrator
of the crime.

One wonders whether or not a fairly

constituted grand jury might have questioned the District
Attorney in seeking the felony murder indictment in this
Case.
All I am suggesting is that there are questions.
This case is not a case where, like in Davis,

one must

conclude that there is an overabundance of evidence showing

40
that the grand jury would have dona what it did and that the
petit

jury would have convicted.
QUESTION;

Do you think, Mr. Rogow, that there was

ever a case tried in any court that after the event someone
could not have concluded that perhaps if he had dons, something
else things might have been better?
MR. ROGOW;

Yes, sir, I think that

QUESTION^ There are such cases?
MR. ROGOW;

No, I think that in most cases; people

would on reflection think that things could have been done
differently.
But here w© are talking about a basic constitutional
right, one established for nearly a hundred years.

And this

is not the kind of thing that one, I think, upon reflection
should say, "Gee, I wish I would have done that."

This is

the kind of thing that one should consider especially, and
that's what disturbs me in this case.

I do not understand

what tactical reason could exist for failing to challenge the
grand jury.

If he had made a plea with the State where they

would not be asking for the death penalty, then perhaps I
could see that he would, have gained something.
QUESTION:

I gather — Goldby

was a cases, as I

remember it, from Mississippi where the lawyer was an
assigned white lawyer and the accused was black, and there
I gather there were some reasons to support, why a white

41
lawyer didn't make the kind of attack.
black lawyers with a black accused.

But here you have got

And what possible reason

could there be for their not -- they had to know about and
did know about the statute which required that the attack
\

be made pretrial.

What possible justification could there

be for their not doing it?
MR. ROGOW:

I can see none.

And then I turn to the

record, and I see that nothing is done in this case until
the day before trial at all, no seeking of the statements that
Francis allegedly made.
QUESTION;

I just wonder, though, their failure to

do it, does that add up to incompetence?
MR. ROGOW;

It adds up to ineffective assistance

of counsel in protecting the constitutional right that Francis
is now seeking to vindicate.
The difficulty, I think, with casting this case
in terras of incompetence is it raises the spectre of
incompetent bumbling lawyers.
QUESTION:

You say -that you could see no reason.

Now, your practice, I take it, has not been in New Orleans.
'MR. ROGOW:

NO, sir,

QUESTION:

Here were two very, very experienced

lawyers, knowing the situation in New Orleans, knowing the
availability of this motion and indicating on this record
that Mr. Amadee had made such motions in some cases.

And then

42
his explanation is that it wasn’t done because it would have
been wasted motion.
Now, if you’ve got. a third lawyer in, perhaps he
would have had a different point of view.

But how can a

court, 11 or 12 years after the event, try to second guess
the judgment of experienced trial lawyers familiar with the
practices in that area.
MR. ROGOW;

We don't think that this record reflects

the conclusion that they did make an intelligent strategic
decision not to make the challenge.

That’s why I don’t

think the Court is bound to conclude ™~
QUESTION;

Could Mr. Amadee have made it when he

came in the case?
MR. ROGOW;

He could have made it, but he didn’t.

But. as he says, he came in the case only for the purpose of
being the trial expert, and whatever Tureaud did before was
Tureaud1s business.
QUESTION;

If he saw a mistake that could still be

remedied, are you suggesting that

as an expert trieil lawyer

he would not have moved on it?
MR. ROGOW;

No, I’m not.

could not have been remedied.

QUESTION;

That’s when Mr. Amadee came into the

It

43
case, is it not?
MR. ROGOWs

Mr. Justice Brennan, I don't think that

we can say from the record that Amadee was in the case on
March 4, 1965»

He said he was in there several months

before —
QUESTION:

Four or five months, he said»

MR. ROGOW:

No, sir.

He said that Mr. Tureaud -—

and there is great confusion in this area.

He said that

Mr. Turee.ud had been in the case for four or five months
