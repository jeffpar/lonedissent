MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 75-510,Flint Ridge Development Company against
Scenic Rivers Association, and No. 75-545,. Carla Hills against
Scenic Rivers Association.
Mr. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER HILLS, ET. AL.
MR. SHAPIRO:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is here on writ, of certiorari to the

United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth. Circuit.

The

question is whether an environmental impact statement must be
prepared by the Administrator of the Office of Interstate
Land Sales Registration before the registration of subdivision
lots under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosures Act of
1968 may become. effective.

And ho state, the meaning -of the

question, I will have to explain the Disclosure Act.
The Disclosure Act requires developers selling or
leasing 50 or more unimproved lots pursuant to a caramon
promotional plan to file a registration statement, called a
statement of

with the? Administrator.

Th© Administrator

is tire delegate of the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development to whom the functions of carrying out the Disclosure
Act have been assigned by Congress.
Th© Act also requires the developer to furnish a

document called a property report, to each purchaser of a lot
within the registered subdivision.

The proper report contains

information from the statement of record which purchasers need
to make their decisions.

Arid a statement of record is a

detailed description of the property, its ownership, title,
access roads, and so on.

In some respects the entire process

is like a securities registration, and the property report is
a good deal like a securities prospectus describing a
particular subdivision.
QUESTION:

The law was more patterned on the

Securities Act of 1933, wasn't it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, it was, your Honor, and I think

that's quite a significant point in viewing the Act because
the Securities Act of 1933 really represented a choice for
Congress to go two ways.

It could have decided in favor of

some degree of substantive regulation of the economic merits
of the securities issue, and instead it opted simply for a
disclosure requirement.

When Congress decided there were

problems about the interstate sale of subdivision lots, it
could have done the same thing.

It could have empowered the

Administrator to consider th© merits of subdivision lots and
make comments and recommendations on them.

Instead, it opted

for not substantive regulation, but simply a system of full
disclosure.
QUESTION;

When was this law enacted?

5

MR» SHAPIRO;

This law was enacted in 1968, your

Honor.
New, unless these disclosure statements are on file
and. in effect, the developer may not use the mails or
facilities of interstate commerce to sell or lease the lots.
Th© statute provides that the Administrator has 30 days from
the date th© developer files the disclosure statement with
his office to determine whether they are accurate and complete
in their disclosures under the Act and the regulations.
QUESTION;

That5s all

he

has the authority to

determine.
MR. SHAPIRO;

That's all he has authority to

determine.
QUESTION;

He can’t hold it up because he thinks

it's a bad deal for buyers or because he thinks it's a bad
use of the land.
MR. SHAPIRO;
that, your Honor.

No.

In fact, the Act is explicit on

It provides in section 1716 of the U.S.

Code , 15 U.S.C. 1716, that a registration may not be taken
to mean that the Secretary or his delegate here, th®
Administrator, has passer! upon the merits — that's the
language of th© statute — has passed upon the merits of the
development or has approved it.

So the Congress was quite

clear they did not want any kind of comment by the Federal
Government or control by -the Federal Government over the merit

6
of land use planning or use of subdivisions in any way.

They

simply wanted disclosure to protect purchasers.
QUESTION:

I take it that there are some statements

that are required in the filing that relate to the environment.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, they do.

The statute calls for

a disclosure of information about nuisances and sewage and
drainage.
QUESTION:

What if it had thought that some of those

statements were false?
MR. SHAPIRO:

If anything required by the statute

or

regulations is false —
QUESTION:

Who do you call him — the Administrator?

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

The Administrator.

How does the Administrator know if -they

are false or not?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, he has a field, force which dcas

some inspecting in connection with registration, and if there
are false statements

that violate the statute, it could foe

a criminal offense to violate the statute.

In any event the

Administrator has the power to suspend the registration just
as the SEC does for false or inaccurate statements.
QUESTION:

Or incomplete statements.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Or an incomplete statement.

this brings us to the time limit in -the statute.
works under

And

The process

strict time limits. The developer submits his

7
disclosure.; statement when he is ready to begin sales and he
wants to use the facilities of interstate commerce.

The

statements in this record/which I think are Plaintiff’s
Exhibit. I

It’s a document several inches thick.

are typical.

Once the statements are filed, the 30-day limit that Congress
as imposed on the Administrator to complete clearance of those
statements goes into effect, starts ticking away.
QUESTION:

Can that be extended?

MR. SHAPIRO:

If the Administrator finds that the

registration statements proposed by the developer are —
QUESTION:

Are deficient.

MR. SHAPIRO:

— deficient, he can suspend it until

corrections are xnade.
QUESTION:

Indefinitely?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, what he will do is advise if

the registration is suspended.

The developer then has a strong

incentive to cat the correction, and vaen the corrections are
filed, another 30 days starts ticking away, and the effort is
then made by the Administrator to complete his rev lev; before
that 30 days.

When that's over, the Administrator sends a

letter, nothing more, a letter to the developer saying, "Your
affective."

And that letter is not an approval

of the merits of the project or a report of any kind.
not even a license* it's simply a note
1 ":iff >■;

Rut

Admir.is'-'rrbor dees act

It's

8

affirmatively to that extent.
MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

To that extent.

That is so in every case.

MR. SHAPIRO;

In every case,- to assure that there

is adequate disclosure.
How, the. petitioners ir this case are the Secretary
and the acting Administrator and a private developer whose
disclosure statements were suspended by the courts below until
IIUD had prepared an environmental impact statement on the
merits of the project involved.

That project, known as

Flint Ridge, is located on heights above the Illinois River
which is 70 miles east of Tulsa, roughly, in northeastern
Oklahoma.

Respondents, the plaintiffs below, were environmental

groups concerned with the preservation of the Illinois River
in its natural state.

They sued to prevent Flint Ridge’s

disclosure statements from becoming effective until HUD had
prepared an environmental impact statement on the development.
The district court and the court of appeals in
agreed

with the respondents and suspended Flint Ridge1s

registration until an impact statement is completed by the
Mmi n i s fcr a t or.
Now, in our view this case only involves one Issue,
whether section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act, or NEPA, applies to

hud's

supervision of developers’

disclosures under the Land Sales Disclosure Act.

There is no

9

question here that the NEPA applies in full to HDD's activities
respecting substantive regulation of any kind or grant or
ether substantive activities.

But we are dealing with a

narrow question, that is, what section 102(2)(C) requires in
a situation like this where there is no substantive regulation»
Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA in effect requires
Federal agencies to include in every recommendation or report
on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
a detailed statement concerning the environmental effects and
alternatives.

It requires a Federal agency to weigh the

environmental merits of their planning and substantiva
decision-making, but in our view it doesn't at every point
of Federal contact with the private sector.

There has to be

a Federal proposal or recommendation for and a report on
major Federal action.

The language of 102(2)(C) is qualified.

Now, the Administrator here is empowered to review
the disclosure statements, as has already been indicated,
only for accuracy and completeness.

This, we submit, is not

major Federal action within the meaning of the statute.

It’s

not major Federal action because the Administrator cannot
pass on the merits of projects, and, of course, you cannot
write an environmental impact statement without passing on its
merits, at least to weigh them and to list alternatives,so
that that point seems quite clearly barred by the statute

10

itself expressly, and it’s also barred because of the nature
of the function since we are only dealing with the disclosure
function.
Secondly, we submit that the Administrator makes no
recommendation or report on a proposal for major Federal
action.
Now, I have already indicated that the statute bars
the Administrator from passing on the merits or approving
any subdivision.

What. Congress intended was that land use

planning should be reserved to the States.

In fact, it went

so far as to say that no developer can represent that the
Secretary has approved or recommends any particular development.
And that's even reflected in the property report as described
in the regulations since on the face of every property report
there is a disclaimer that this property report does not
represent any approval by the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development or any comment on the merits.
QUESTION:

Is it your view that the phrase "major

Federal action” is the critical phrase?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It’s exactly in that phrase that it's

qualified.
QUESTION:

.And that the statute, the National

Environmental Policy Act of 1969 does not apply even though
the action is major unless the- Federal participation in the
action is also major.

Is that it?

11
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's essentially it, your Honor,

because what we are dealing with here — well, really what we
are saying is that you cannot turn major private action into
major Federal action, even by virtue of —
QUESTION:

By virtue of minor participation by the

Federal Government.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is exactly the point, your Honor.

And we think that this was clearly Congress' intent in the
Disclosure Act because of the previsions they included in it
barring comment on th® merits because the legislative history,
where Congress in the Senate report expressly said that, the
Government may not pass upon the quality of what is being sold
or upon such questions as land value, land use, or zoning.
They clearly left the whole question of land use planning to
the States.
QUESTION:

Is it your claim that this is not Federal

action at all?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No, no.

Clearly the Administrator has -

As I paraphrased it the first time was

your position.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

That's correct.

This becomes even clearer when you look at what the
Administrator does not do.

I-Ie has no land us© planning function

He doesn't disburse any funds.
guarantee,

He doesn't give any HUD

He has no control over the design of subdivisions.

12
He is not permitted to stop a private development or direct the
developer* to go ahead.

He is not. in any sense in partnership

with the private developer.

Indeed * in this case, there are

no Federal funds of any kind involved and no Federal planning
involved in the Flint Ridge development.

It’s a private

enterprise.
When you consider this in the light of the fact that
the Administrator normally has 30 days in which to complete
his review before one of the statements automatically becomes
effective, it's apparent that you cannot get an environmental
impact statement requirement out of the statute.
QUESTIONS

What's wrong with the argument that an

impact statement ought to be prepared and filed so that the
Administrator can tell whether the disclosures are adequate
and accurate?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think cne reason is that it’s the

Administrator who has to prepare the:
QUESTION:

impact statement-

That's just the statement is a statement

of fact.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is, your Honor.

So instead cf making an investigation with,

his field force and have them write, a report to him, he has
them write an environmental impact statement saying, "Here are
the facts; her© is what this will do," and then he has to
tell whether the disclosures and the filing are adequate and

13
accurate.
MR, SHAPIRO:

Well, the impact statement in that

context would serve primarily as a check-up on the developer.
That's what you are implying, that we could have it as a
check-up on the developer.
QUESTION:

He has to do that, doesn't he?

He has

to make up his mind whether he is going to approve this filing
or not.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the principal check on the

developer is the obligation to irt.ike truthful statements and
the criminal sanctions that follow.
QUESTION:

He sends people out, I suppose, as you

have suggested to see if these disclosures are accurate.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Usually they inspect the registered

subdivisions themselves to see that they haven't been changed.
It is a very limited field force.

But the statute itself

wouldn't permit the preparation of this within the 30 days.
Most environmental impact statements take at least 120 days to
prepare, and on a major project ?. great deal longer.

So -that

the Administrator really has to rely on the submission by the
developer and most developers are truthful.
But there is another function which an impact
statement could serve, I suppose, and that is that it could
tell purchasers about the nature of the development.
that's not. involved in this case because —

But

14
QUESTION;

It could also tell State enforcement

authorities something that they might not know,
MR. SHAPIRO;
they mainly argue here.

Yes.

And that's one of the things

But that's not involved in this kind

of a case because there hasn't been any request her® that the
basic document for giving information to purchasers and the
State authorities, namely , the registration statement be
•amended to include more environmental information.

They

haven't, requested that the regulations be amended.

They

simply say that, well, we would like more information, therefore, you must file an impact statement.
Now, given the fact that Congress intended land use
planning to be for the States, it seems to me rather difficult
to argue,for a State parti.cula.rly to argue, that, well, we
need information so the Federal Government ought to give us
more information.
QUESTION;

Mr. Shapiro, are there any provisions

of the National Environmental Policy Act that require impact
statements or their equivalents by anybody but the Federal
agencies?
MR. SHAPIRO;

No.

Section 102(2)(C), as I understand

it, applies only to the Federal Government.
provisior for

There is no

private developers to file one.

QUESTION:
as far as you know.

In any aspect or under any circumstances,

15
MR. SHAPIRO %

Under present law, that is my

understanding.
QUESTION?

Has it ever been suggested or held that

the Securities and Exchange Commission ought to file an
environmental impact statement when it permits a registration
to go into effect?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, it has not.

The court below

misread a decision called National Resources Defense Council v.
SEC out of the District Court for the District of Columbia.
That case held that SEC in adopting regulations dealing with
more environmental disclosure would have to adhere to the
Administrative Procedure Act and males fuller disclosure,
arguably, than it had made.
that

But there was no case holding

environmental impact statements are necessary in each

SEC filing.

In fact, if we had to have them., the impact on

our nation's capital markets would be just devastating because
of the number of securities issues that are involved.
QUESTION:

Well, has even that been held.

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That has not been held.

Anywhere other -than in the District of

Columbia?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Even the District of Columbia case

didn't go that far, your Honor, and no case, to my knowledge,
has gone that far.
QUESTION:

Has there been any litigation on it beyond

16

•chat District of Columbia litigation, that you know of?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTIONs

That I' know of, no.

Any claim, in other words -—

MR, SHAPIRO:

No, what has been going on is a vary

elaborate rule-making proceeding before the SEC with respect
to how much additional disclosure is necessary.

That’s still

going on.- . There have been hearings and proposals, but certainly
there have been no —
QUESTION?

That is environmental kind of disclosure?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, environmental disclosure, which,

of course, is a different question than we have got here.
The plaintiffs here did not go tc the Administrator and say,
"Amend these regulations to require more environmental
disclosures in statements of record and property reports»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

.Mr. Thieman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. PAUL THIEMAN, JR.
OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER FLINT RIDGE
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
MR. THIEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

What is major Federal action?

That’s -the issue in

this case.

Congress commanded, all agencies of the Federal

Government in those instances where it proposed to take action
which is major Federal action which has a significant effect
upon the environment that it must prepare an impact statement.

17
This impact statement must, fos prepared by the agency prior
to the time that it undertakes the action.

The impact statement

itself is a detailed written statement prepared by the agency.
It describes the-? impact of the proposed action upon the
environment♦

It describes what alternatives there are to

the proposed action.
The purpose of the impact statement is to b© used
by the agency as a tool to assist it in its decision-making
processes.

In that connection the agency weighs the impact

of the proposed action upon the environment.

It measures

the benefits of the action against the burdens on the
environment.

Most importantly, what the purpose of the impact,

statement is is that it gives to the agency the power to take
into consideration as to whether or not it should permit the
project to go forward, whether it should modify the project,
or whether or not it should stop the project, altogether
because the environmental consequences are so severe.
'Now, if -the agency under its organic Act doesn't
have the potirer to permit the project to go ahead, to modify
it

to reduce the environmental i.mpact, or to stop the agency

action altogether, then there is really no usa or purpose
to fulfill in the preparation of the statement because it's
meaningless.

To determine whether or not an agency has the

power to permit actions to go forward, to modify the proposed
action or to stop it altogether, you have to look to -fell®

18
organic Act under which the agency was created to determine
whether or not the agency has such authority and power under
the Act. And in this case, when you look at ILSA, you will
see that ILSA was passed by Congress and dealt with the subject
of sales.

In the spectrum of land development sales is at

the very end, because what has preceded sales is land acquisi­
tion, the planning, the financing, and to a substantial effect
development and development afterwards.

All of those things

which preceded sales HUD has no involvement in and has no
authority and has no jurisdiction over the developer’s
activitiss.
Take, for instance, Flint .Ridge in this case.
Flint Ridge acquired its property in February of 1973.

No

Federal approval was required by HUD in connection with that
acquisition.

When Flint Ridge was doing its planning and when

it was doing all of the things that had to be done to comply
with the State and local laws of Oklahoma, there was no
approval required by HUD in connection with those approvals,
and when Flint Ridge obtained its financing, no Federal
approval was required by HUD in connection with. that.

And

more importantly, at the time that Flint Ridge began its
construction, which was in 1973, which was more than six months
prior to the time that it filed its registration statement with
HUD, it actually undertook its construction activity.
•tii® time of the trial in this case, it had spent over

And by

19

$3.5 million in construction on tils development.

And in

connection with all of this expenditure of money, all of the
construction activities, Flint Ridge did not have to obtain
the approval of HUD.
QUESTIONS

What sort of a development was this?

MR. THIEMAN:

This is a second-residence

subdivision

your Honor»
QUESTION:

And how many units?

MR. THIEMAN:

The first — this is the so-called

first phase, and ‘there was 1,014 lots in the first pha.se.
QUESTION:

And how many structures?

MR. THIEMAN:

The part that was being-sold is vacant

lots to purchasers.
QUESTIONS

I see.

MR, THIEMANs

Of course, what happens in this kind

of a development, a developer never knows beforehand how many
of the lets within ‘the subdivision that he is going to sell
with houses on them, how many he will be selling with contract
to build houses, hew many he will be selling to other
developers- — and by the way all -those types axe exempt sales
under the Act.

So what a developer really does is that he

registers all of these lots to keep his options open.
QUESTION :

You were talking about the timing and

you said- that. HUD doesn't play any part even as a recipient
until the time comes for sales.

And I was wondering how much

20
had than been don©.

Not very much actual construction of

structures,, is that right?
MR. THIEMAN:

Your Honor, it’s not in the record,

but what is in the record is that between July of "73 and
July of ’74? over $3.5 million had been spent in actual
construction of the development.
QUESTION;

That is including sewage or septic tanks,

or whatever?
MR. THIEMAN;

No, this was just roads, a water

treatment plant, improvements, club houses, those typos of
improvements.
QUESTION;

But not the individual units.

MR. THIEMAN;

Not the individual units.

So we have a situation that if HUD doesn’t have any
control over the development activities of the developer, which
really is what causes the impact upon the environment, then
HUD should not be required to do an environmental impact
statement.
QUESTION;

The developer has expended all of his

money, roads, club houses, and other facilities at his own
peril.
MR. THIEMAN;
QUESTION:

Well, you use the term "peril" —

In the sense that he doesn5 fc know what

the ultimate consequence is going to be for the project.
MR. THIEMAN:

Is your Honor talking about, when you

21
say 85peril” —
QUESTION:

Well, it has been held up now, I take it.

MR. THIEMANs

That’s corrects, though ws.say

erroneously so.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. THIEMANr,

But I am talking about hard reality.

Yes, w© have been held up.

I would like to save the balance of my time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW T. DALTON, JR.

MR. DALTON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it pleas©

What we have here is an action brought by several

thousand people in the State of Oklahoma who have come
together in one way or another in action against their Federal

Tfoafc-s what started this lawsuit.
The issue before this Court# or non-issue before

QUESTION:

Da you suggest that th© environmental

at all on the decision by -fell© Adsdnistrator with respect to
the filing?
MR. .DALTON %

It could very well provide information

with respect to the accuracy of the filing.

It could very

well provide information with respect to the administration of
the Act itself, that is, there are many things that the
Administrator —
QUESTION:

I taka it you would be here, however,

even if the filing required nothing at all with -respect to
the environment? no facts at all that that could be called
environmental?
MR. DALTON:

Yes.

And in the record also w© have

Act itself.

And that's consistent with the

It's on© of the purposes of the Act.

Another thing that is not before this Court; in terms
of issues is whether you can disapprove a filing on
environmental grounds.

And there are cases such as Zabel v.

Tabb out of the Fifth Circuit that say that you can disapprove
on environmental grounds.

I believe they did similar things

ir. Marco Island hero just recently.

24
QUESTIONs

What was the reasoning of the Fifth

Circuit in the Zabel ca.se?
MR. DALTON:

Simply that the National Environmental

Policy Act, and particularly 101, provides substantive
authority to the agency involved to considar environmental
matters and could reduce or suspend or prevent a permit on

QUESTION:

Was that consistent with our first

SCRAP opinion in which w® said that NEPA does not alter or
amend any other statutory provision?

And her© you do have a

statutory provision, don11; you, that the Administrator doesn't
©xprass any position on the merits?
MR. DALTONs

1 think it’s & matter of an enlargement, of giving the agency
one more tiling to consider.

QUESTIONS

Yets, sir.
I think that is the language to which my

brother was referrlag in his question.

25
MR® DALTON:

¥@S, sir®

Another issu® is not whether HUD can do anything about
the ®B?ironBi0ata! degradation it finds , although there ar®P I
believ©, many things it can do about it —- provide information
to others, for example.

And HUD has promulgated what is called

Handbook 1390.1*. Guidelines for Compliance with the National
Enviornmental Policy Act, and part; of that requires and directs
th® members of the Department to meet with and discuss these
matters with the developer, the applicant, to work our. an
amicable way of resolving some of these things without
necessarily through an enforcement procedure®

Thar® are other things that are not at issue before
this Court, and I think it goes to the question of what really
is at issue.

The facts are not at issue.

the degradation is not at issue®

Th® significance of

Judge Bohanon found actual

potential effect in all aspects of the environment,

for

example, upon the depth and course of the river itself, upon
socio-economic conditions, esthetic conditions, the habitat,

the fish and wildlife.

These are on appeal and are not at

issue fosfcr© this Court, and they are found at his finding Ho® 14
Another matter that is not at issue before 'this
Court, and which is- admitted, is that the filing
permission to

and the

sail interstat® commerce facilitates the

developer in obtaining money in interstate commerce, and without
<*

that, this development would not exist.

26
They talk about there would b® degradation anyway.
Well, that9s talking about something in abstract, because in
the facts of this case, it would not be degradation'anyway.
We not® that they have said they are not doing anything now.
’ Much of tills money is spent for other things 'than environmental
. degradation.

For example, in the record — find it reflects

that lass than one-ha If of the paved reads are in pl&c@, less
than one-third of the unpaved roads are in place.

Ther® are

only 16 of the potential 3,000 septic tanks in an area that is
ill-suited for septic tanks, according to the findings of the
""court.

There are virtually no structures existing on the

7,000 acres.

The human involvement there is minimal at bast.

The social-economic problems that would ensue as a result of
this development are yet'to occur and will occur in tie future
and perhaps by thinking about it now, w© may b® able to
mitigate that, either at the States, local, or Federal level.
Another problem with that argument is that, it can
ask you to frees© a point in time the question of environmental
impact and. consider the Flint Kiidge in a vacuum, which the
Court did act do,

There are .peripheral effects.

Other

developments: may occur, side issues•' viti» respect to development,
satellite developments and this sort of thing may occur.

This

is a very fragile echosysfcssia, the Illinois River Basin.

We also see that many of the effects -that will flow
from this development will be continuing in nature.

27
The option, for example, for 1.4,000 more acres has been
dropped.

And soma of the things they talk about ©xempting

lots and so forth, they haven't dona it.

In fact, in the

letter to this Court asking that it be advanced for hearing,
they did complain of the fact that they were at a standstill,
if you will.

So there is significance to what the Tenth

Circuit said and what Judge Bchanon said about money and
interstet® ©ommerc© and the connection between the filing of
tea approval to sell interstate commerce and the obtaining of
money and the environmental degradation.
The issue in this case must fee considered of what
HUD is trying to do.

HOD is trying to get this Court to

condone their excessively narrow construction of their
operating authority in spit© of what- Congress said.
is very simple.

Must HUD under the facts ©f this case prepare

an environmental impact statement in a format tailored to th-3
circumstances of this eas© prior to giving permission to

Anti why?

Th® answer is simple.

Yes, they

It is compelled by the language of the

statute itself, by the legislative history of the statute, by
all caff.es which 'have construed the National Environmental
Policy Act to data by CEQ guidelines and by HUD5s own handbook,
1330.1.
So wa haws major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment?

You e®n8t

28
bifurcate that language.

It is all part of the same term.

And whether you have on® or two tests really don't make any
difference under the facts of this case.

w@ have proven in the

record, and accepted by the trial court and the Tenth Circuit,
facts to reflect each test.

W® approve in magnitude? we approve

in controversy; we approve in cumulative effect; w® approve in
QUESTION?

Will you pinpoint, for me at.least, the

major Federal action?
MR. DALTONs

What is th© major Federal action?
Well, th® Federal action, to begin, is

the giving of permission to sell interstate commerce as a
result of a, filing.

It becomes major when you considar fete

end result that occurs, and that is th® substantial, actual,
potential. or cumulative effect on the environment, as
r

■

1

stated, for example, in Simr&ns v. Grant, which is cited in th®
*

\

brief, but for this filing the degradation would not take place.
In other words, they war® not going to do anything unless they
can get that uioney in interstate commerce.

As stated in th®

Minnesota FubIia_Interest "/■■ Buts case, it makes little sens©
to call a Federal action minor when the end result, whether by
public authority or by privat® authority, is major.
QUESTION:

What if the Federal action consisted only

in carrying son® of the correspondence of this developer in
United States mails and yet the development was absolutely
mammoth and had & tremendous impact on th© environment and there
was Federal action that was essential to get his financing from

29
the New York bankers.

Would that require an environmental

impact statement?

QUESTION %

That applies to every construction in the

country, doesn’t it?

If it involves money, it involves a major

Federal intervention , because you get money through interstate
commerce.

That's your position.
MIR. DALTON: You can get money through interstate

commerce, although there is th© option avallab1© not to get
money in interstat® commerce, in other words, there are
specific exemptions in th© .^ct itself in which they could
obtain 'money in interstate eoam .are a but not have to qualify

QUESTION s

And that's all.
Yes, sir, that's all in

any case.

I'm talking about this case.
Suppos-.s there io a securities registration

statement filed with respect to a bond issue, the proceeds of
which would be used for an offshore oil rig which if installed
would certainly have

environmental consequences, does the

SEC, because it could disapprove, have to file an environmental
impact statement?
MR. DALTONs Yes, sir, in my opinion ihey would.

I

think probably to maybe get to son;® of these questions a little
more directly, the National Environmental Policy Act is
one thing, is an administrative reform statute, and it is
designed to achieve a certain amount of cooperation among all
of th® Federal agencies.
Now, ona of th® problems with th® argument that has
been presented today and probably on© ox the underlying premises
of the question is.that we are talking about HUD existing in a
vacuum.

Thor© ars other Federal agencies.

Now, if HUD can't

do anything about it, they are required to provide th© informa­
tion and should provide the .information to other Federal agencies?
State agencies, and local agencies which may in fact b® able to

32

do something about it, whether HUD can or will.

So I think

probably , the answer to your question ip very definitely y®s.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Dalton, say that last sentence again.

I’ didn9t hear it.

MR. DM.TQN:

The answer to your question is definitely

yes, because vm cannot considar the lead agency or the
responsible agency in a vacuum.

They ar© required to cooperate

with other agencies which may and can and probably will do
something about it.
QUESTIONS

Doesn*t an affirmative answer, then,

really mean the SEC in almost every securities registration
situation has to file an environmental impact statement?
ME. DALTON:

That is true, but probably there is

a fear that an environmental impact statement may look something
like the Alyeska situation.

1 think w<s can tailor it to the

circumstances at hand.

MR. DALTON:

That's correct.
las it even quit® that.

The statute

doesn't speak in•terras of filing a statement; it speaks in
terms of the agency including in a statement with a proposal

I was curious to know precisely what la­

the proposal that is supposed to incorporat® -the environmental

MR. DALTON:

I think it is a proposal for

of otter major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of th© human environment term in that section which
has to do with the» decision to permit th© sales in interstate
commerce* and that is th© triggering action.
QUESTION s

But the Administrator really has almost

no discretion in deciding whether to permit those sales, does h©

36

once hci is satisfied that

truthful disclosure has been

mad©?
MR. DALTON%

One© h© is satisfied, sure, but

has

hm

tremendous, or she ban tremendous, discretion in determining
what is necessary before there is adequate compliance, not
only what, is necessary in protection of the purchaser, what is
necessary in protection ©f the put lie interest, and what would
make the filing not misleading under the circumstances.

These

ar© left for the Secretary and her Administrator to determine.
QUESTIONS
may require

But that all goes to what the Secretary

to he filed by the developer, not what; the

Secretary or the Administrator hinaolf may fila in terms of a
proposal,
■MR. DALTONs

No, but that5s th® thing, what is

developed in compliance with the Act.

And when you have

superimposed upon th® Interstat® land Sales Act, the requirement
of•compliance with NSPA, this would include environmental
information sufficient to apprise all parties, all agencies of
government, State, local, or Federal, of th© environmental
consequences.
See, what we have here, I think, is a statutory
mandate to

exercise compliance with the Act to the fullest

extent possible.

It’s not inherently flexible.

w© must construe this statute, the National
Environmental Policy Act, from its four corners.

We can’t pick

31
out 102(2)(C) and say that this is the only part of the Act.
1 think all of the casos in regular statutory construction
will tell us that.

It's a mixed question of law and facts

involved in tills case, and X think that is on© of the things
that they said in SCRAP in this case»
They talk about a so-called conflict, and this is
this 30-day thing.

We must begin with the preface that in

order to avoid compliance, the Ac* — it must be impossible
or it must be expressly prohibited.

First of all, this

question of conflict was never raised in the trial court*

It

has not been litigated and there are no facts before this
Court in respect to conflict*

Again, w® are not talking about

doing an BIS.
©a® ©sath Circuit described this as a superficial
argument, and quite correctly.

XLSA, the Interstate Land

Salas Act and N35PA are very compatible.

Theyare both full

disclosure .laws} they both provide information in th^ public
Interest.

And ia fact, if you get into the legislative history

of both of them, they usee virtually identical language.
Thor© is no specific exemption to compliance ia
XLSA.

They are both — the Interstate Land Sales Act and the

IIEPA — have baan amended, and in fact sine® the instigation
of this litigation.

Arid X am sure that Congress knows how to

exempt the Department of Housing and Urban Development frcca
compliance.

They do so by saying that nothing herein shall be

38

considered major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment, aad they have done it in
several statutes* but not in this on®*
‘Jto com® before tills Court and argue that there is
a conflict is to adroit a specific violation of section 103*
Section 103 required all these ag-Bncies* HOD included* to
review their operating authority and their statutory mandate
to determine whether there were any insuperable barriers to
compliance.

There is nothing to indicate that that review

process was to await the talcing of major Federal actions
significantly affecting tfe® quality of human environment*
was to be done by a date certain*

1't

We must conclude* therefore*

that HDD did it and found no insuperable barrier to compliance*
V

As

tli©

Court,

said in Calvert Cliffs

it*a too late now

to raise this argument.
Compliance is consistent with CBQ Guidelines -

CEQ

Guidelines talk about a license* an entitlement to us® or
a -permit.

In fact the CBQ itself in. a letter dated July 7*

1975, from th® Director* to David O. Meeker* of Housing and
Urban Development* talked of several arguments that needed
further discussion and attention* and among these has keen a
concern about NBPh compliance in -die office of Interstate
I*and Sales and suggested ways of complying*,

such as

incorporate information on the environmental impacts in the
statsmgnt of record* establish thresholds to determine

39
significance», prepare a program, EIS’s and this sort of thing.
And they said w® believe that HOD could, solve th® issue by
taking steps 1b line with the above suggestions.

The CSQ

themselves feel that there is not compliance, and, of course,
their determinations ar© entitled to great weight.
Is there a conflict by administrative burden?
talked about administrative burden in their briefs.

They

W® begin

with the preface that Congress did intend to interrupt business!
as usual in these agencies which heretofore have not. cared
on® iota, and before this Court today the Department of
Housing and Urban Development does not ear® one iota about
th® environment.

■

The GAO, I think v@ cited this in our brief, has
criticised them, and 1 think they quit® correctly characterized
their lack of concern is based on empire building.
W© could go further and to say they flat don't
car©.
Th® facts of the case control the type of compliance,
and it's not that difficult.

One of the purposes, as I think

w@ pointed out, has been partially fulfilled, and that is
interagency cooperation.

The statutes must b© read as &

purposesWhether hud can or will do anything about the

Tfcsy

are legally correct, based upon the statutes,

the legislative history, the 3®s<its that have construed the
Act'to date, and all of these regulations and guidelines ‘that
ar® involved.

They are economically correct.

In trying to

internalize our true costs and recognize those ultimately,
one of the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act
was to- learn and quantify all of these costs so that they can
be taken into consideration for the protection of the public
and the public interest.
It, is ethically correct.

We have tried t© evolve
