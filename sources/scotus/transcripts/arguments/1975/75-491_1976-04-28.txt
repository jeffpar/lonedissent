MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

next in 75-491, United States against Agars.
Mr. Prey, I think you may proceed whenever you're

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW PREY, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE' PETITIONERS
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on the government’s petition for
a writ

of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the

District of Columbia Circuit which had ordered a new trial.
On the afternoon of September 24th, 1971,
respondent and the decedent James Sewell checked into a
Northwest Washington tourist heme, registering as man and
wife.
About 15 minutes later, three employees of the
tourist home heard screams emanating from the room occupied
by Sewell and respondent.

Upon forcing open the door of the

room, they discovered its two occupants on the bed, Sewell
lying

c:;j

top of respondent, and both holding on to a knife.
"here

testimony showing that respondent’s h«md

was on the handle of the knife and Sewell’s on the blade.
After -the two were separated, police and ah
ambulance ware called,
where he died.

Sewell was taken to a nearby hospital

4
Respondent in the meanwhile had slipped out of the
tourist home in the confusion and disappeared.
The evidence showed that Sewell had had some
$345 in cash on his person about two hours before the fatal
incident, which money was not found on his person or in the
room after the stabbing»
An autopsy of Sewell revealed that he had been
stabbed numerous times in the chest, abdomen. and back with
a knife, including a stab wound of three and a half to
four inches in depth into the heart, and another that
entered just above the navel and penetrated about five and a
half inches into the liver.

There were also cuts on the

palms of Sewell*® hands of a kind, according to the medical
examiner, that might be received by one trying to defend
himself from a knife attack.
Respondent turned herself into the police the next,
'day, at which time a physical examination of her disclosed
no cuts, wounds' or bruises on her person.
The prosecution's theory at trial was that Sewell
had gone to the bathroom down the hall, and upon return to
.the room had found respondent rifling through his clothing.
In the ensuing dispute, respondent took the knife and
repeatedly stabbed Sewell, causing his death.
The defense contended that respondent, who did not
testify as to what had transpired, may have acted in self™
defense.

Counsel based his argument to this effect on the fact

5

that it was respondent’s screams that the motel employees had
heard and the fact that when they broke into the room, Sewell
was lying on top of the respondent.
The jury found respondent guilty of second degree
murder.
In the course of preparing for trial,
respondent' s trial counsel had interviewed a. witness who
advised him that he believed that Sewell had been arrested a
number of times, and possibly convicted, for assault with a
knife.

After consulting with another attorney, who was a

former teacher of criminal law and an experienced practictioner,
counsel concluded that any criminal record Sewell may have had
would have been inadmissible in evidence in support of
respondent *s claim of self-defense because it was not known
to respondent.

He therefore made no further effort to

discover or use information on this subject.
Now some three —
QUESTION:

Presumably he had inquired of his client

and found that she had no knowledge of —
MR. FREY:

Yes, he so stated in his affidavit in

this case.
Some three months after respondent was convicted,
the Court- ef Appeals decided a case called United States
against. Burks, in which it stated in dictum

that evidence of

prior specific acts of violence by a. deceased would be

6

admissible in a homicide case to support a claim of self-defense
even if not known to the defendant.
When counsel learned of this decision, he checked
the prosecutor's case file and found that it did contain
Sewell's criminal record which consisted of two misdemeanor
convictions in 1963, one for carrying a knife and one for
simple assault with a. knife — this was eight years before
the homicide — and another misdemeanor conviction in
1971 for carrying a knife.

Ha thereupon brought his motion

for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence,
which has lad us here today.
The District Court denied respondent's motion for
a new trial on the basis of alleged prosecutorial suppression
of the evidence of Sewell's criminal record, and subsequently
also denied a second motion for a new trial based upon the
alleged ineffectiveness of respondent's trial counsel in
pursuing this matter.
The Court of Appeal reversed.

While it expressly

refused to find that the prosecutor had engaged in deliberate
suppression, it concluded that the element of prosecutorial
misconduct, in the absence of a defense request for the
r.on-disclosed evidence in this case, were much less significant
in assessing & new trial motion than the materiality of the
undisclosed evidence„
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, was the case before the Court

7
of Appeals on direct appeal from the conviction?
MR. FREY:
on direct appeal.

Yes, it was before the Court of Appeals

When this matter came out it was remanded

to the Dictrict Court for a hearing.
trial was denied.

The motion for a new

It was then — the trial counsel then

moved to have himself removed as counsel, and new counsel
appointed, and it was remanded, 1 believe, to the District
Court for a second hearing on the ineffective assistance of
counsel point.

But I believe it was on direct appeal rather

than collateral attack»

I don’t think it would really make

any difference, though, to the disposition of the case.
QUESTION %

Well, then, nothing turns on the nature

of the newly discovered evidence for purposes of granting or
denying a motion for a new trial.
MR. FREY:

I'm not sure I understand your question.

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, was the case before the

Court of Appeals in the posture of an attack on' 'the judgement
■of conviction, or a claim that the trial judge erred in
denying the motion for a new trial on the basis of newly
discovered evidence?
MR. FREY:

The latter.

QUESTION:

The latter?

MR, FREY:

Yes,

"

Now, the Court of Appeals held that

a new trial is required whenever, irrespective of the blame­
worthiness of the prosecutor's conduct., the undisclosed

s
evidence might have led the jury to entertain a reasonable
doubt about a defendant's guilt»

It concluded that this

evidence came within that category, and thus a new trial was
required»
In so ruling the court was essentially following
the precedent established by tha District of Columbia Circuit
nearly ten years early in the decisions in Leven against
f

Katzenbach and Leven against Clark, from which the Chief
Justice, then a Circuit Judge, vigorously dissented.

In the

view of the majority in those cases, the absence of a defense
request and the lack of defense diligence in discovering evi­
dence subsequently claimed to justify a new trial, are factors
to be given little or no weight in deciding the new trial motion.
The mere fact that the prosecutors possessed evidence' that
might have been helpful to the defense was alone sufficient
to require a new trial.
The dissent effectively expressed the contrary
view, which is our view, that those factors are critical.
That Is: prosecutorial breach of duty, and defense diligence,
•And that their abandonment is difficult to justify either in
logic or in terms of the impact of such a ruling upon the
?

fabric of our adversarial system.
At tha heart of this and like cases in our view is
the need to choose between these two analytical models.
one propounded by Chief Judge Bazelon in Leven. the clear

The

9
tendency of which is to impel the government toward an open
files policy in criminal cases.

And the one upon which the

Chief Justice's dissent was grounded, which seeks to define
a duty of disclosure within the context of the adversarial
system.
4

Now before turning to further discussion of these
analytical models, let

stress the salient facts of this

case, which in our view Conclusively demonstrate the error
of the Court of Appeals' decision.
First, the defense knew that Sewell probably had
a criminal record, but it chose not to pin down the details
of it;

’this was not evidence within the prosecutor's ex­

clusive possession.

It was equally available to the defense.

They simply had to subpoena the police department to get it.
QUESTION^
assistance of counsel.

You don’t submit the issue of ineffective
But I notice that in this brief, the

respondent’s defense said that — I gather, in defense, even
if you’re right on the first point, in defense of the judgement
below.

Jure you going to address the ineffectiveness —
MR. FREYs

Well, I will if the Court wishes at the

conclusion of my argument.
QUESTION;

Well, am I right that the respondent is

relying on ineffectiveness of counsel to support an affirmance
of the judgement?
MR. FREY:

She relies on it.

And in our reply

10
brief we have addressed it*

We think that it is a proper issue

before the court, that it is an alternative ground for
affirmance, and we urge this court to decide it.

And wa?ve

discussed why —
QUESTION:

Was it decided below?

MR. FREY:

It was not decided below.

QUESTION:

Nor presented?

MR. FREY:

It was presented below.

QUESTION:

It was presented.

MR, PREY:

It was presented but it was not decided

QUESTION:

And not decided.

MR, FREY;

And the reason that we are urging this

court to decide it is twofold,

One is that this homicide

occurred in 1971, and this case has been going a very long
time without resolution.

And secondly, it's really the other

side of the coin of prosecutorial misconduct or non-disclosure,
and I think that the two issues are sufficiently interrelated
that it is appropriate for this court to consider both aspects
in reaching its decision,
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, can defense counsel simply

obtain by discovery the rap sheet on a decedent in this
District?
MR, FREY:

I'm advised that — certainly at the

time that this case was tried — I mean there is a Privacy
Act now although I don51 know that it would apply to the

11
deceased»

But at the time this case was tried,» I believe all

that was necessary was a subpoena to the police department.
In this case all that was necessary, surely, was a request
from the prosecutors for the information.
QUESTION:

Well, but you're saying in effect, he

could have gotten if by means other than going to the
prosecutor. •
MR. FREY:

That5 s correct.

QUESTION:

It wasn't within the exclusive province

of the prosecutor.
MR. FREY %

That's correct.

QUESTIONS

That's different than saying, he could

have gone to the prosecutors.
MR. FREY:

Well, I'm making both points, although

I think they ’Both have a telling effect in the same direction.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say she could have gone

to the prosecutor before

trial, that is under the Brady

theory.
MR. FREY:

Well, but I'm also, I'm making it

although I realize there's n© finding on this issue — I'm
simply making a pragmatic assessment.

I mean, had they gone

to the prosecutor and asked, there's nothing in this record
to suggest that it wouldn51 have been given.

Prosecutors

frequently voluntarily disclose information that's requested
of them

12
QUESTION;;

Or if they could get it from the police

department afterward, they could get it from the police
department before trial.
MR. FREY:
afterward.

Well, they got it from the prosecutor

They could have gotten it from either the prosecutor

or the police department

I think, before trial,

Now the second point is that both the defense and
the prosecution believed that the record was not admissible
into evidence.

Thus, even if the prosecutor had disclosed

the record to the defense, it wouldn't have been used at the
trial.
Now thirdly, this view of inadmissibility was
quite reasonable at the time,

It was only as the result of

a dictum in a case decided three months later that it appeared
likely that such evidence, might have been held admissible.
And indeed today, I think six judges of the Circuit Court
of Appeals have indicated in their opinions on our petitions
for re-hearing, that they would probably view this evidence
as inadmissible.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals,

the local court, has stated that such evidence would be
inadmissible if not known to the defense»
QUESTION:

That might give us some reason to

wonder why they — having that view — they didn't resolve
the matter in the Circuit.
MR. FREY:

Well, we asked them to and I can't

13
answer.

Thera were four votes for re-hearing en banc.

But

we needed five to secure it.
How, finally, even if the defense had known of the
evidence and of its admissibility, there were good tactical
reasons not to use it, and these are addressed in the last
section of our brief,
them.

And respondent has not really answered

The evidence would have tended to show Sewell's

familiarity with a knife, and therefore enhance the
implausibility that respondent could have — had he attacked
her first — succeeded in inflicting such grievous wounds
upon him and escaping totally unscathed herself.
Now, if a new trial is going to be required on
the basis of evidence such as this, we think there is very
little left to any principle of finality of judgements in
criminal eases.
Turning to the analytical framework, in our view
cases like this can and should be approached analytically in.
much the same manner as any motion for a new trial based on
newly discovered evidence.

The first ingredient in every such

case is the question whether the evidence is in fact properly
characterized as newly discovered.

It has uniformly been held

that evidence known to the defendant, or discoverable in the
.exercise of due diligence, cannot supply the basis for a new
trial.

There's no reason to depart from that simply a Braciy

claim is involved.

Indeed, it's highly inappropriate to do

14
so.

Because the heart of the Brady claim relates to evidence

in the exclusive possession of the government.
Now let’s assume however that if the evidence of
«

Sewell’s criminal record can properly somehow be treated as
newly discovered, or that the requirement of new discovery
can be dispensed with.
Court must next consider, in any new trial'motion
on the basis of newly discovered evidence, what the proper
standard is for assessing the sufficiency of a particular
piece of evidence to warrant a new trial.
Now ordinarily when the evidence is simply
uncovered, and it was unknown to anyone prior to the trial,
the standard is whether the evidence would probably result
in a different verdict on re-trial.

This is an ancient and

nearly uniformly followed standard.

That standard fully

accounts for the balance we have struck in our system between
the undeniably important interest that convictions of
innocent persons not be,permitted to stand, and on the other
hand, the interests in the finality of judgements arrived at
after fair trials."
No one seriously - suggests that respondent can
meet that standard in this case.

If she’s to get a new trial,

therefore, it"s not because of concern that she may be
innocent, but because of other policies.
How to sharpen the focus, the question is: what

15
bearing does the fact that the prosecutor possessed the
'particular piece of evidence in question here have on the
standard to be applied in determining whether the evidence
supports a new trial?
The Court of Appeals plainly believed that that
fact alone sufficed to justify a new trial on the most generous
possible standardt that is, whether the evidence might have
affected the jury's verdict.
We say that that fact standing alone has no effect,
A further question must be asked, that is? did the prosecutor's
failure to disclose constitute a breach of duty on his part?
Only if that question can be answered affirmatively is there
any justification to depart from the normal standards for
awarding new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence.
Because only then can if. be said that the trial that did
take place was infected with unfairness.

And only then can

it be thought that the award of a new trial might serve a
useful function in shaping future prosecutorial behavior,
Now, this analysis that I'm propounding, some of
the commentators have suggested that it is inconsistent with
certain .'language in this court's decision in Brady against Mary­
land .

Specifically, what the court said in summarizing its

holding was that the suppression by the prosecution
of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates
dv.e process when the evidence is material either to guilt
or punishment, and here are the important words.

16
"...irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the
prosecution.”
Now in Lever;, against Clark, the majority took the
view that, that language meant that the more generous standard
of awarding a new trial was not to turn on prosecutorial
■misconduct but simply to turn on consideration of whether the
evidence might have helped the defendant, had. it been introduced
at the original trial.
We think that’s incorrect.

First of all the

language applies only when there is a defense request.

The

defense request in some sense may be viewed as taking
the place of, or imposing an additional duty on the prosecutor
and therefore relieving the court of the obligation to make
a determination about his subjective state of' mind.
In any event we- think what that language means is
that you judge the prosecutor’s'conduct not by having to find
subjective bad faith, not by having to find .willful misconduct,
but by looking at the known facts and determining whether,
objectively viewed» those facts show a departure from his
duties.

This is the same standard that is used in conventional

negligence law,
iisoiose.

It still requires that, he had.a duty to

If he had no duty to disclose that he breached, it’s

simply pointless tc award new trials by virtue of what turns
cut th.cn. to ba a wholly fortuitous fact; that ha had the piece
of paper in his file that contained this evidence.

17
Now, if we have agreed thus far that the prosecutor
must have breached the duty of disclosure, we next suggest that
the presence or absence of a meaningfully specific defense
request is of central importance in defining the prosecutor's
duty of disclosure.
Now, let’s be clear about what I'm contending here.
If the prosecutor has willfully suppressed evidence, active
with mens rea, a request would be unnecessary.

Moreover, as

Judge Friendly has indicated in the Keogh case — and it has
come to be generally accepted in the second circuit and a
number of other courts, if the evidence is of such obvious
exculpatory value that it couldn't have escaped the prose­
cutor's attention,

even without a request, then there would

be justification in those circumstances for awarding a
new trial even in the absence of a request.
The cases cited by the Court of Appeals, from
page 9a of the petition and footnote 10 are such cases.
libler case,

the prosecutor misrepresented the

In the

testimony

that would be given in proposing a stipulation, although he
.imew that the person would not testify as he proposed in the
stipulation.

In Barbe-a, the prosecutor failed to disclose

to the defendant ballistics evidence indicating — and
fingerprint evidence indicating — strongly that the defendant
was not guilty.

18
In Users against Wilkins, which Mr. Justice Marshall
wrote when he was on the Second Circuit, two eyewitnesses
known to the prosecution and not known to the defense had
failed to identify the defendant and the prosecutor had not
disclosed that»

In Poole — it was a rape case — there was

evidence, medical evidence, that in fact the complainant had
not had sexual intercourse.
When we're talking about that kind of evidence we
don't doubt that the prosecutor has a duty of disclosure to
the defense even in the absence of a request although if the
defense already knew about the evidence, we do doubt that a
new trial would be required.
But most situations don't involve that,

ha Judge

• Friendly ssid in Keogh, that's the rare case when the
prosecutor acts witij that kind of gross negligence or
callous disregard.; for-..fair play.

The normal case is a case

like this in which the prosecutor, who naturally is an adver­
sary looking at the

file from a•certain perspective, who is

not familiar — he doesn’t know what the defense knows, he
doesn't know what the defense is', going to be.

He doesn’t

.Cor him to fail to appreciate the exculpatory utility, of a

piece of information in his file, unless he has had the

19
benefit of a focussed defense request which calls his attention
to that kind of information, which therefore elevates his duty
to examine that kind of information with care, too look at it
from' a perspetive of a defendant and to see whether, so
viewed, he can perceive its utility tc the defense.,
QUESTION:

When you say a focussed defense

request , you mean something -more, then, than just a request
for Brady materials?
MR. FREY:

Absolutely.

Our firm position -on this is

that a request for all Brady materialf all exculpatory
material, is theequivalent of no request,

All that does is

say to a prosecutor, plaa.se obey your constitutional or other
obligations.

It doesn't perform the function that a request

is to perform, which is to call the prosecutor’s attention to
certain kinds of evidence.
QUESTION:

But the defendant probably doesnh any

more —“ probably knows less about what5$ in the prosecutor's
file than the prosecutor does.

And they both know |?hat kinds

of evidence would be relevant, don't they?
MR. FREY *

Well, that's not necessarily true.

file or cot is not relevant.

He can ask for it.

I mean, this case is

If the defense wanted Sewell's criminal

record, in order to show that he was the aggressor, it was
a very simple thing for them to ask for.
QUESTION:

possession of that information?

Well, the trial was in July.

after.

As it turned out,

this particular panel had

sat on a direct appeal of a refusal to admit the evidence,
it might have reversed the conviction *

But I don't think that

even represents majority sentiment in the District of Columbia
circuit.

In any evert X think it is an important point, not

so ranch in. this case, where there was no request, but in terms
of understanding the general analysis, that to ask defendant

21

simply to request all the Brady material is a formality.

I

mean if that's all it amounts to, then I think we might s.s well
forget about having a request requirement, because it would
simply be unfair.

It is inconceivable that there would be

any reason for a defendant not to ask in that fashion.

What

the defendant has to do is to call to the attention of the
prosecutor that he's interested in certain kinds of information.
QUESTION s

Give me an example of a piece of paper or

a piece of evidence that the prosacuotr wouldn't be obligated
to turn over on his own but yet be obligated to turn over on a
Brady request for that specific document?

I don't suppose the

prosecutor is 'required to turn over every piece of paper that
the defendant asks for.
MR. FREY:

In other words, which ones aren't?

Well, it's clear, the requirement to

turn over — well, the constitutional- standard which this
Court has expressed is in terms of evidence that is requested
by the defense that is favorable and that is material.

Well, as to two of these convictions, it

MR, PREY:

That's right.

Which was already in

evidence, that he was carrying a knife on the particular
occasion.

But let me point to another example.

In the Levin

case the evidence that the prosecutor had was a statement
from a witness equally available to the defense that he didn't
remember something.

The prosecutor wasn't claiming to use

•this witness to prove the point.

Yet the court said, as it

often does, that, well, had the defendant had this, which he
could have gotten by simply going and asking the witness the
same questions, had the defendant had this, why he might have
changed his defense strategy, he might have been able to
utilize this non-recollection of a particular event to —

And that would be something you wouldn51

have to turn over on your own but which you would have to turn

don't think it's insurmountable,

I

Wow, obviously, if the nature

of the information is such that the prosecutor can appreciate
that the defense couldn't possibly realise that it existed,
that would go into the mix in determining whether the
prosecutor had comported with his duties.

It's not important

so much hot' the duties are defined as that we clearly recognise
at the outset the principle that there must be a breach of
duty.

However the court ultimately chooses to define that

duty, whether it be more stringently than it has in Moore and
in Brady.

There must be a breach of duty before a new trial

can foe awarded on this ground.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.,

Court of Appeals says? on direct appeal, this case, the judge­
ment is reversed and sent back for another trial,
MR. BRADLEY:

Yes.

Now, may it please the court,

perhaps at the outset, because there seems to be such a
striking difference — I think it will emerge that there is
?usch a striking difference between the perceptions of this case
that I have and that my brother has that I should state our
general view of the case and the general principles and
propositions that we urge upon the court, but I will fully
intend to vary particularly get into the record.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bradley, before you get too deeply

into this case, I’m still a little troubled by the procedure»
Because I didn't think your client — I don't know whether
began, the counsel or not — discovered this evidence until almost

25
four month after the trial was over*

So how could it have

been a direct appeal reversed on this ground?
*

MR. BRADLEYs

As 1 understand it, counsel at that

time had saved the appeal rights, and when substitute counsel
did take over the appeal and made the Brady point a subject of
the appeal.

But that time, there- was delay.

to run from the judgement of conviction.

The time began

That was sometime

after the trial, and by that time ■— frankly, I'm surprised
that there's a question about this because I simply assumed
that we were all agreed that we were in the Court of Appeals
on direct appeal on the Brady point and on the ineffectiveness
point with regard to the motion after trial ended based on
ineffectiveness of counsel.

But the Brady point, as I under-’

stand it, was definitely before the Court, of Appeals on direct
appeal.
QUESTION :

I assume you were not trial counsel in

light of the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.,
MR. BRADLEYs

No, we were not trial counsel.

Now, generally speaking, then, respondent’s sub­
mission to the court today is, that the knowing possession,,
the conscious possession of evidence which, on the basis of
perfectly clear precedent was admissible at that time, on
the basis of the knowing possession of" clearly admissible evidence

MR. BRADLEY;

In this way.

specifically for this evidence.

But the prosecutor was aware

of the fact, through pre-trial investigation, was aware of
the fact and had conscious possession of this evidence; made

the high degree of probative value, made the deliberate choice
to withhold it.

the conscious, deliberate choice not to disclose this evidence,
which again I submit the record will show, and the nature of
the case will show, he had to recognize it was palpably

was hurtful to his case.

excused because it's otherwise available or because there is
no request.

QUESTION:

I don't really know because —

Have you read their opinion — by the

four judges- who would have granted en banc consideration of
the case ?
MR. BRADLEY:

But not after having had the benefit

of argument by both sides, of gaining a full appreciation for

QUESTION:

32
MR. BRADLEY;

If they'd had the case argued.

And

it was not argued to them.
But in any event, even if they now believe that?
at the time this case was tried, this evidence was admissible.
QUESTION;

But how can you say, in light of the

doubt that certainly exists, as evidenced by the opinion of
four of the judges, that the prosecutor deliberately withheld
information which he and counsel forthe defendant both thought —
as the four judges did — that the evidence was inadmissible.
MR. BRADLEY;

Well, of course, our submission,is,

as I said, that the negligence of the defense does not excuse
the failure of the government to disclose.

The prosecutor and

the government should be charged with knowing that this
evidence was admissible because there was a case on the books
which quoted from an earlier case, the Griffin case, which,
as I said, if they are road, they are flat holdings that this
evidence is admissible.

These cases touch upon this very

admissible.

And at that time this evidence was clearly

And the later case which the government mentioned —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bradley, you say clearly admissible.

Was this prior evidence evidence of acts of violence?

Is

evidence of possession of a knife evidence of an act of violence?

33
MR. BRADLEY:

Your honor., there was a conviction

for assault with a deadly weapon.
QUESTION's

Oh, there was?

I thought it was just

possession of a knife.
MR. BRADLEY:

And the 1971 conviction, as the

court's file in this case will show, was for assault.
Bo our position would be, then, that if we go to
the record of this case, the record will demonstrate that the
prosecutor was knowingly possessed of evidence, that, as an
experienced pro,secutor, he must have realized, and .1 think the
%

Court will conclude, he knew full well, was probative for the
;

defense and hurtful of his case.
At the'very beginning-— now the government suggests
that maybe the prosecutor doesn't know a thing about, the crux
of the defense, or the theory of the defense.

Six months

before the trial at a bail hearing the defense attorney stood
before the judge and said, we have a very real issue here of
self-defense.

There were screams.

When these people were

found, he 'was trying to kill her.
The government responded to that.

The government

knew six months before the trial that it was facing a fight
on the question of self defense.

The government tells us or

the prosecutor tells us that there were several conferences
both before and after the bail hearing with

between

prosecutor and defense attorney where they discussed,the

34

issues in the case,

And very specifically, they discussed

the character of Sewell,

The prosecutor offered the

characteriteration, he was not a pillar of the community.
Now t think that very clearly shows again that he knew he was
in a fight on the question of the character of the victim in
this death case.
QUESTION'S

When he said that to the defense counsel--

MR. BRADLEY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

couldn't the defense counsel have

said, have you got any rap sheet on him?
MR. BRADLEY?
QUESTION:

Yes, he could have,

And he didn't.

MR, BRADLEY:

But he didn’t.

Ho, he did not.

But the prosecutor

knew he had a rap sheet, and he did not tender it to the
defense counsel.

And it was a perfectly simple thing to do.

And if he wasn’t simply stonewalling, if he wasn't simply
saying, I'll wait this out, hope he doesn't ask for It.

QUESTION:

But I'm trying to find out why

you take the 'positio:! that the government has to do everything
and the defense counsel you excuse from doing anything.

If

you’d get in the middle there I could better understand your
point.

■-

MR. BRADLEY:

35

Yes, because the question hare is

the fairness of the trial and whether or not the constitutional
rights of this defendant are protected.

And if it turns out

that she's been whipsawad by suppression by the government and
negligence by the defense, the result shouldn't be that they
cancel out.

This isn't a matter of last clear chance.

I

reject the notion that this is something like a negligence
case.

This is a question of the constitutional duty of the

-government to tender exculpatory material.

And I simply fail

to see any good reason why it shouldn’t, tender that favorable
material.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bradley, I want, to be sure I'm clear

on the admissibility point.

I was under the impression that the

record showed that he was arrested for assault but pleaded,
guilty to possession of a knife.

Now if that is a correct

understanding of the record, is it your position that the
arrest

information would also have been admissible?
MR. BRADLEY;

May I speak first as to whether or

not that is correct?
QUESTION;

Yes, I’d like to hear it.

MR. BRADLEY;

The government has put into the

file — and that file is available to the court, it's the file
in this case — a certificate of conviction, April, 1971, a
\

guilty plea to assault.

Now there was a charge — assault

with a dangerous weapon, carrying a prohibited weapon, knife,
and a Uniform Narcotics Act violation.

Now our position is

that this entire record constitutes, on the one hand, actual
evidence itself.

Admissible evidence showing' specific acts

of violence under the Evans case.

Secondly, it provides an

excellent lead to the defense attorney with respect' to
opinion ./..ad refutation evidence •

Anci^bhirc.ly, we would submit

that it is admissible, as the Burks case shows,,

The Burks

case, let me just quickly say, involved a conviction for
cruelty to a child — that was the only conviction.

And the

court ruled that the defense could show that the victim caused
the death of a child.

So here, the defendant could show not

38
merely the conviction, but also the circumstances leading up
to this bargained plea.

It would be open to the defense to
i

show the actual circumstances of the assault with the brick,
of the assault with the razor, of the carrying — well, there
was a conviction for assault with a razor — but of the
carrying of the brick and the prohibited weapon knife,
presumably the same bowie knife.
Now the record furthermore —* as I said, this

He knew that he had

Ha knew that he had a character issue.

He

came to possess a record with this rich promise for the
defendant as far as exculpatory evidence was concerned, and
he had to then decide, whether or not, under the Brady rule,
he had to disclose that.

Ha made the conscious decision — and

I would submit to the court it was one of callous indifference
he made the conscious decision not to disclose that evidence.
QUESTIONS

Well, what do you know about the man's

state of mind?
MR. BRADLEY:

Well, We do know that he has

admitted to having heard this fact that the defense in the
case, the whole crux of the. defense, was to be self defense,
We know that he was thinking of a tough fight in a murder case.
And we know then that he must have deliberately sought and
obtained tills criminal record,

Now, was he simply somehow

airily innocent about whether ar net that might hurt his

39
case if it came before a jury?

Didn't he have any conscious

thought as to whether or not this was admissible into evidence?
And if he did, did. he do any research?

And shouldn't the

government be charged with knowing that this case held this
was flatly admissible?
QUESTION;

Well, why shouldn't the defense counsel

be charged with precisely the same thing?

He3 s a member of

the bar.
MR. BRADLEY:

He very definitely is, and having

failed to do it in this case, there is ineffective assistance
of counsel.
QUESTION:

But why is that so, Mr. Bradley?

In

all walks of life, except apparently in your view of
ineffective assistance of counsel, principals are charged with
the acts of their agents.

Now why shouldn't the defendant

here be charged with the action of her agent, who was her
counsel?
MR. BRADLEY:

Well, that of course would destroy

the whole notion of ineffective assistance of counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, it would certainly water it down

some from your rather wide-ranging view of things.
MR. BRADLEY:

Well, I don't — your honor, I would

submit, it's not my view of ineffective assistance of counsel,
it's the view of the American Bar Association in its
promulgated standards, and it’s the view of the now™leading

40
case in the District or Columbia that says "prompt investigation
of factual and leading material»®."
QUESTION:

Well, this Court has spoken on this

.subject and defined it, has it not, in McMann and Tolette.
MR. BRADLEY:

Yes, your honor.

And in McMann, as

I understand it, it invited the various localities and
jurisdictions to begin formulating specific principles, which
is what has happened in DeCoster.

Well, I don’t recall McMann saying

anything about that at all.

MR. BRADLEY:
QUESTION:

And I think the record bears that out.

I see,

MR. BRADLEY;

And furthermore — you see, what's

happened in this case — with the permission of the Court,
there was a reference to the fact that, well, we all know that
it was Sewell's knife.

The jury knew nothing of the sort.

Now as I said, the prosecutor knew he had a knife issue.

And

in the pre-trial he conceded to the defense attorney, well, it
looks like' you’re right, it's Sewell’s knife.
on page 48 of the appendix.

You’ll see that

The first witness that he called

in the case was Sewell's wife, the victim.

He asked her, did yc

42
husband carry a bowls knife?

No, never.

And he took pains

to have her demonstrate for the jury the length of the knife
that he did carry, indicating it was merely a pen knife, and
it was a pen knife that was found in his pocket.
This prosecutor, having conceded prior to trial
not only that he had a knife issue by apparently it was going
the other way, then went int o the trial, having concealed some
very eloquent evidence as to knife carrying from the defense,
went to the trial and then developed for the jury evidence from
which they certainly must have concluded, taking the invitation
of the prosecutor, that this knife was not taken into that room
by Sewell.
He then asked the desk clerk, did you observe any
weapon?

And the desk clerk said no.

two witnesses.

Wow these "were the first

Then later in the trial he brings in another

person who was in the

motel, Griffin , bring him from the

lockup, asks him seme very brief questions, one of which was
whether or not you observed & weapon, and he said, yes he had.
And then he also asked him another question with respect to
position of the knife and proceeded to discredit his
:eztimony on that.

The only evidence before the jury, in other

words,•that Sewell the victim carried the knife was from a
witness discredited by the prosecutor.
So this was a prosecutor who overplayed his
adversarial rols.

He knew he had evidence,

la, !'ve. said, an

43
excellent characterization was that he simply stonewalled.

Now

that's what the result is going to be if you follow the sug­
gestion of the government here today.

If this Court doesn’t

take the opportunity to announce a rule, as a matter of firm
policy, that any thing consciously in the possession of the
prosecution which is readily recognizable as relevant to the
defense and hurtful to the prosecution, that that must be
turned over to the defense, what you're going to get is a

'

prosecution then doing precisely what this United States
Attorney did, waiting and hoping that the defense will miss
the boat, and then arguing contributory negligence or arguing,
shouldn't the defense have to help itself.

And I submit,

that's an excess of any adversary concept.

And I would suggest

to you that the rule — I would submit to you that the rule
that we ask you to follow today is, as I've said, administrative!
feasible.

There's no hurt to the government in having to

comply with this rule.

Or certainly it was not plainly admissible.
Now what the prosecutor said in arguments to the

District Court — and there's no basis for assuming that he
was lying — explained to the District Court — this is at
page 148 of the appendix — there was nothing in this case
which indicated to the prosecution that the record of the
decedent was in any way favorable or usable by the defense in
