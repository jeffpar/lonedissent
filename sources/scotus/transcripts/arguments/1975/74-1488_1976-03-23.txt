MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We511 hear arguments next

in 74«»1488, Secretary of Interior against New Mexico.
Mr. Randolph, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. RANDOLPH;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
This case is on direct appeal from the judgment of a
three-judge district court for the District of New Mexico,
declaring the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burros Act of 1371
unconstitutional, and enjoining the Secretary of Interior from
enforcing that Act.
The issue in the case is whether Congress had
authority under the Constitution to pass that federal legis­
lation.
The suit was begun in this case by the State of New
Mexico, its Livestock Board and Director and one private
individual in March of 1374.

The complaint alleged facts

relating to a particular incident involving 19 burros, which
I will deal with shortly.
More generally the complaint charged that the
federal Act was interfering with the New Mexico Livestock
Board's administration of their Estray Law — ” ©stray61 meaning
a stray domestic animal.

That, as a result of that interference,

4
the State of New Mexico was being deprived of constitutional
rights, and the number were enumerated, including 'the Tenth
Amendments- that Congress had no authority to pass this piece
of federal legislation because, the complaint alleged, the
animals in question, the wild horses and burros, were not
damaging or molesting, I think the term that's used in the
complaint, the federal land? and also because the particular
burros in question were not migratory.
The Act, I should give a short description of* deals
with, as the title indicates. Wild Free-Roaming Horses and
Burros found on federal land»

The statute defines these
*

animals as all unclaimed and unbranded horses and burros on
the public lands of the United States»

The statute further

defines public lands to mean only those federal lands
administered by the Bureau of Land Management of the Department
of Interior, and the Forest Service of the Department of
Agriculture»
That's not an insubstantial quantity of acreage?
about 300 million acres is encompassed within «the administra­
tion of those two federal agencies.
. However, —
QUESTION: Do they all have wild burros on them?
MR. RANDOLPH:

However, the Forest Service only

has about five percent of all the wild burros, comprised ora
these two areas of land? 95 percent is controlled by the —

5
of the burros and wild horses are on BLM land.
QUESTION:
QUESTION;

Are on what?
Bureau of Land Management,,

MR. RANDOLPH;

BLM, yes.

The Act directs the Secretaries to manage and
protect —
QUESTION;

How about the private land?

MR. RANDOLPH;

There is nothing in the record to

indicate, so far as I’m aware, how many burros are on privata
land, or how many horses.

I suppose one would have to, first

of all, take a population count.
QUESTION;

This only deals with wild *—

Can you shoot them on private land?

MR. RANDOLPH; Sorry?
QUESTION; Can you shoot them on private land?
MR. RANDOLPH;

Well, I suppose if they are your

burros, and they
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

No, no, I mean stray burros.
He's asking if the law covers private

land, and it does, I think.
MR. RANDOLPH;

It does.

For a wild horsa or a wild

burro, which is defined as an unclaimed or unbranded wild
horse or burro on public land.

If that animal strays onto

private, land, the Act provides that the owner of the private
land may call either the BLM or an agent of the Secretary of
Agriculture and ask that the animal be removed, in which case

6
the particular federal officer must remove the animal»
Section 4 of the Act provides, though , however, in no case ,
shall the individual kill the animal that strays onto the land»
QUESTION; Well now, what does this mean in practical
effect?

A private landowner sees a wild burro on his land,

who has been, in his opinion, damaging his own crops and his
own stock and depriving his own stock of food and all these
other things that are alleged in the amicus briefs, and just
decides to pick up his rifle and shoot him»

And there's no

proof that that burro has ever been on public land, ~~
MR» RANDOLPHs

It’s not really a federal criminal

offense»
QUESTION;

—• but, on the other hand, if it can be

proved that that burro had ever set foot on public land, then
what?
MR» RANDOLPH;

Well, the Act provides that

it

deals with the wild horses and burros that are an integral
part of the federal public lands»
QUESTION;

Yes, but these are transitory, these are

not — these are not flora, these are fauna»
MR» RANDOLPH:

I realize 'that»

I don’t think that

that means that simply because an animal sets foot on federal
public land
QUESTION; Well, what does it mean?

MR» RANDOLPH;

— that he becomes an integral part of

7
it»
But, before I get too deeply
make one point.

into this, let me just

That issue is not involved in this case.

These burros that were taken in this litigation, that are
involved in this litigation, were, first of all, all found on
federal land when they were seized.

The coraplaint filed by

\

the State of Hew Mexico, by the State Livestock Board and by
the private individual, does not make any allegations
relating to the question of whether these burros were on
private land or not. on privates land.

It doesn't make a

point of that.
But, so far as the evidence shows, the burros were
totally on public land.

There’s a statement on page 4 of the

Appellees’ brief that says the record indicates that these
burros spent, a majority of time on private land.

The reference

in the brief is to, I believe, App. page 46 and 48,

There’s

no support for that, statement in the record.
QUESTION: Do you think there’s some support for -the
statement that they interfere with the lessee's property on
public land?
MR. RANDOLPH: Well, that’s — there’s an allegation
in ‘the complaint, that they damage — they do not damage the
public land.
QUESTION:
about my question?

Now, that isn’t what I asked you.

Hew

8
MR. RANDOLPH :

The lessee's property?

The lessee

of public land, I suppose.
QUESTION;

Yes.

The lessee's property, supple*"

mental feeding that he brings onto the public land.
QUESTION; Grazing rights? his cattle land.
MR. RANDOLPH; Well, as far as this case is concerned,
maybe I ought, to give a factual statement on it.
QUESTIONs

Well, let's just say that wherever you

are grazing cattle on the public land, you carry

salt onto

the land, you frequently carry on supplemental feeding onto
the land, and you find out that some wild burros are eating
up your supplemental feeding.
Now, is there some evidence to that effect in this
record or not?
MR. RANDOLPH;

There’s evidence that these burros

were eating protein blocks.

Well, let me say that that is

not, Mr. Justice White, a usual practice for all the grazing
within the Taylor Grazing Act.

I think the Bureau of Land

Management, at least, has informed raa that supplemental
feeding is something that's frowned upon usually? the use of *»*»
QUESTION:

How about salt?

MR. RANDOLPH: As well as salt.

The reason for that

is because the —QUESTION;

Well, there's always salt.

MR. RANDOLPH:

— because .rfche burros and horses -then

9
tend to browse more than they otherwise would, which is
damaging public land in a way that they would otherwise not*
Whether that's active or not, 1 don't know*
But in this particular case, the burros that were
involved here were seized from one Mr* Kelley Stephenson's
ranch in New Mexico, in the south central part of New Mexico,
And the case arose as follows?
While Mr» Stephenson, a New Mexico cattle rancher,
was visiting BLM offices and. dropped by to talk to a number of
BLM officials, he was told by them that they had seen 25
burros around an area called Taylor Well,
on federal land,

How, Taylor Well is

Taylor Well is a joint watering spot for

•this particular rancher and another rancher,
Mr, Stephenson, the rancher in question here, had a
six-month permit to graze about 40 head of cattle as a winter
pasture in this particular area»
That was the first, apparently, Mr» Stephenson knew
of the burros around Taylor Wall,

As a matter of fact, he

said he was surprised, because, although he had been in the
area for 29 years and had seen burros in the foothills to the
east, he had never seen them around this particular well*
At that point, as far as Mr. Stephenson knew, -the
burros and the cows wore getting along, there was no harm,
whether they were eating his protein blocks or not, the
Bureau of Land Management certainly didn't know; at least, all

10

they had was a photograph of the burros standing around the
well*
Now, Mr, Stephenson returned to his ranch and
confirmed the presence of the burros,

But, rather than calling

up the Bureau of Land Management, after he allegedly, as the
complaint says, found that the burros were molesting the cows,
other than doing that he called the New Mexico Livestock
Board,
Not/, Mr, Justice White, you mentioned the problem of
the burros perhaps interfering with the cows. There is a
provision in the regulations that the Bureau of Land
Management has promulgated under the Wild Horses and Burros
Act,
QUESTIONS
with the cows,

I didn't say anything about interfering

I asked you were they eating up some property

in the pastures of the lessee,
MR, RANDOLPH;

As to interfering with the property,

the cows are the rancher's property,
QUESTION! And there's evidence that they were in
this record,
MR. RANDOLPHS They were eating protein blocks,
QUESTION;

Yes,

Whether that's usual or not, they

were eating up his protein blocks,
MR, RANDOLPH;
blocks

Yes, -they were eating his protein

11
But if they were in — but the allegations in the
complaint are that they were molesting his cattleP not 'that
I don't know whether the complaint even talks about protein
blocks or salt blocks or whatever? the complaint says that they
were molesting his cattle.
The regulations of -~
QUESTION;

Well, I suppose if they're taking food

away from the cattle, that's molesting them, isn't it?
MR. RANDOLPH;
molesting, Your Honor..

I would not characterise that as
It seems to me that that would be

direct physical contact, which is, I think, what he was
claiming, and pushing them aside and so on and so forth.
In any event, —
QUESTION;

If evidence of eating the protein blocks

came in without objection, presumably the complaint is deemed
amended, is it not?
MR. RANDOLPH;

I don’t question the relevance of that®

I'm saying that the argument and the contention was not based
on that particular fact.
it in one way or another*

And I don't think the case rests on
I don’t think the constitutionality

of this Act rests on. whether these burros ware eating protein
blocks or not.
QUESTION;

Or whether they were found on private

property?
MR. RANDOLPH;

In this case they were found, on public

12
land —
QUESTION s

I know, but you — apparently you would

think it would make no difference, whether they were found on
private property or not»
MRo RANDOLPH: The constitutionality of one provision
of this Act, which is not in question here, may turn on that
question; but that is not an issue that the district court
dealt with in any way.
In any event, there is a regulation, as I was going
to say, from the Bureau of Land Management that provides that
problem animals shall be removed from an area if they
interfere with wild life, or they interfere with livestock,
or they interfere with individuals.

But rather than asking

the Bureau of Land Management, after the rancher returned,
the rancher called the New Mexico Livestock Board, which is
composed of seven individuals who, according to State statute,
must adequately represent the livestock industry in the State.
And also must be engaged in the livestock business.
QUESTIONs

Isn’t there an allegation that he first

asked the federal authorities to please remove these?
MRo RANDOLPH:

There’s an allegation

testimony is as follows on that question:

the

1 askad the Bureau

of Land Management official what they do if the cows and
donkeys don't get along.

He said, and I think I’m quoting

T-his almost exactly, “if the cows interfere with the burros,

13

the cows have to go,”

And that's in the Appendix,

The New Mexico Livestock —
QUESTION?

Well, in fact, under the law, the

private landowner could have requested

or if the private

landowner had requested the federal authorities to remove
the burros, it was up — it was incumbent upon the federal
authorities to do so, wasn't it?
MR, RANDOLPHS

That's right.

But he’s — Mr. Stephenson, is not a private landowner
as far as this land is concerned.

The closet piece of Mr,

Stephenson's land
QUESTIONs

He’s a what, a lessee under the Taylor Act?

MR, RANDOLPH;

Yes,

He's a permittee under the

Taylor Act, having a six™month grazing permit using this area
for 40 head of cattle for winter pasture,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh,

MR, RANDOLPHS
Appendix, the closet,

piece of property to the area where the

burros were seised, that is in private ownership, Mr,
Stephenson's ownership, is two and a half miles away, from the
Taylor Well,
mile.

The quadrants on that map are each one square

It's in tee Appendix,
The New Mexico Livestock Board, as I said, administers
/

what they call the State Estray Law.

Mow, this law provides that

any horse or burro running at .large on the public or

14
private land of the State, in the State is considered an
astray, a stray donestic animal»

Apparently, obviously,the

New Mexico Livestock Board construes public land as including
not only State land but also federal land.
And the Act provides, the New Mexico Act provides
that a person having knowledge of estrays may, upon getting the
authorization from the Livestock Board, simply round them up,
so long as he ships them to the nearest railroad depot for
turning over to an official of the New Mexico Livestock
board.
Another way that ©strays can be impounded is by the
Livestock Board itself, and that’s what happened in -this case.
Now, 1 should point out to the Court some tiling that
I discovered only in preparation for this case, and that is
that the New Mexico Estray Law was emended after the decision
in this case.

The definition of what is an estray was

changed from, instead of any horse, burro or mule, et cetera,
running at large on public or private lands, it was changed
to any livestock or buffalo found running at large on public
or private lands.
we don't think that changes the outcome or the case
at all, obviously.
QUESTIONs What dees New Mexico do with them after
it picks them up?
MR. RANDOLPHi After they get 'them, they are supposed

15
to disposed of according to the directions of the Livestock
Board*

In this case the 19 burros were seized and impounded

and then taken by truck to Roswell «*- I hope I pronounced that
correctly — Ilex-; Mexico, and sold at a public auction*

The

proceeds of the sale* the amount of -axe sale is not shown in
the record* The proceeds of the sale are paid to the New
Mexico Livestock Board*
One of the appellees in this case* Appellee Foster*
purchased three of the burros*

The record does not show who

purchased the other 16*
QUESTION?

Purchased for what purpose?

MR* RANDOLPH? Well* the r«)cord doesn't show what the
other 16 were purchased for* and I'm -QUESTION? Well * what I'm trying to get at is* do
they dispose of them, kill them, something?
MR. RANDOLPH?

Oh, well, they could be used for

dogfood, they could be used for fertilizer, they could be
used as pets, they could be used for donkey basketball teams*
QUESTION? And the purpose of the Federal Act is to
preserve them as a species?
MR* RANDOLPH: That's right*
And, as a result of that, because of their protection,
the United States, through the United States Attorney's
Office, when it. found out about -the burros, demanded their
return from the New Mexico Livestock Board*

They did not

16

discover this until after the sale had taken place, which was
one week in February of 1974, after the burros we re rounded up»
When the United States demanded return of the burros,
this suit followed»
Now, our principal argument in this case is that the
Act is a valid exercise of Congress* power under the property
clause of the Constitution»

That provides that Congress shall

have power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting
the 'territory or other property belonging to the United States»
Congress didn’t legislate, however, on the basis that
these animals roaming the federal lands were owned by the United
States,

The Senate Report specifically says that 'these

animals are owned by no one individual, they
the people of the United States at large»

are owned by

And we don’t make

that claim in this case»
Rather, our claim is, and our argument, that the
regulation, the regulatory authority over these animals is
derived from Congress’ power to make needful rules, as the
Constitution says, respecting the federal public land»
QUESTION;

Well, you’re not urging that the

senate Committee’s view is correct as a matter of law, are
you, that the burros anywhere in New Mexico are owned "by the
people at large”?
MR» RANDOLPH; We don’t press ‘that contention one way
rr the other, Mr» Justice Rehnquist»

We say, regardless,

17
Congress legislates in a great many ways and legislates with
respect to a great many things they don't own0

We say that —

that -the federal government doesn’t own. We say that it doesn’t
matter whether these burros are owned if they’re on federal
public land or a part of it, then Congress can legislate„
That’s hardly a new startling proposition,.
One of the cases that -«=■
QUESTIONs Well, suppose the rancher shoots them on
his own private land, after he hasn’t been able to chase them
off, where is the jurisdiction under the Public Lands Act then?
Clarify that for ms.
MR. RANDOLPHS

Well, we think it’s from the

necessary arid proper clause„ There are areas, and I suppose
the Stephenson ranch is one indication, where — which comprises
about. 8,000 acres of federal land, that he has no rights to
except the permits to gras© there.

And interspersed there

are 2,000 acres of private land and State land.
We think Congress, in order to preserve these
animals on the public domain could protect them the moment —
from, being shot the moment they stepped off into a parcel
that was not part of the public domain.
animal

Of course, the

the farmer or the rancher can protect against that,

I suppose, by fencing his property, if he wishes them not to
cross.
QUESTION s

Do you think -a:© question on private land

10

is any different with respect to these burros than it is
with respect to deer and elk, insofar as the State purports
to tell the landowner* "Don't shoot elk out of season" or
"don't shoot deer out of season, . even if you find them on
your own land"?
MR, RANDOLPH:

The — well, with respect to

the

State does that with respect to Stand land. The State does
that with respect to federal land as well. We think it's a
different question, because we’re deriving not

the federal

government is deriving its power from the fact of ownership
of the public land, whereas the State, in the cases like
Perez and others, is dealing with kind of a general police
power to provida for the welfare of its citizens,
QUESTION: Well, I know, but if the question is
whether or not a landowner is free to shoot game on his own
land, the —
MRo RANDOLPH: Well, I was going to speak to that
right directly, Mr, Justice White, -which is — deals with the
power of an individual over his land, and I was going to say
that the authority that’s being suggested here by Congress,
that's being forth in the wild Horses and Burros Act, is hardly
a new, startling proposition.

One of the cases that’s been

cited by -the Appellees is Gaer vs, Connecticut.,

And if you

read Geer, the Court points out that as far back as -the
Sixth Century in ancient Rome in the Institutes of Justinian,

19

it was recognized that, a landowner has the right to prevent
others from killing game on his land.

And that’s what Congress

has, as far as the part of 'the Act that is at issue here,
provided.
QUESTIONS

Those are so-called feral animals, though.

Is it claimed that these are feral animals?
MR. RANDOLPH;

Yes, they are feral ~ a feral is —

QUESTION; These are just horses and donkeys that
have run off from some rancher’s property, isn’t it?
MR. RANDOLPH;

A feral animal

animals ~
QUESTIONs A feral animal is a wild animal, and
indigenous wild, undomesticated animal.
MR. RANDOLPH;

Usually one that had been domesticated

is a feral animal.
QUESTION;

Not — I don't think so.

Not as I

remember my Latin.
MR. RANDOLPH;
QUESTION;

Well —

Feral means wild.

MR. RANDOLPH;

It means wild, but it usually is used

to refer to one that had prior — previously been domesticated.
But- aside from that, we think the proposition that
Congress can control these animals cn the federal land is
hardly open to doubt.

Congress could — and -this Court, has

recognized in a case called Light vsc JJnited_ States that it

20
could prevent anyone from coming onto the public land at all..
It could build a fence around all 300 million acres of the
public domain»
trespassing»

It could charge anybody coming on there with
It has that authority,,

We think it also could provide a gatekeeper, who
says , If you come onto the public land, you shall not kill the
animals that are there»
v

If Congress can do that, I think that’s clear from
the prior decisions of

this Court, we 'think it has the lesser

power to say that if you come on, don’t destroy the animals
that are using the public domain and have used it for hundreds
of years, don’t destroy them, don’t molest them, don’t
harass them, don’t try to capturo them and take them away»
That’s all this Act does.
The district court’s opinion states that Congress
couldn’t protect the wild horses and the wild burros because
they were damaging the federal public lands, is the way the
district court put it.
We find this a rather strange proposition.

It would

mean that if they are damaging 'the federal public land, then
Congress could protect them, or if they were benefitting tie
federal public land, I suppose then Congress could destroy them.
•That, we submit, really doesn’t make very much sense, and
certainly the Framers of the Constitution didn’t intend, we
think, the property clause to be read that way.

21
Nowt I notice that in the — as I pointed out —- the
complaint of the Appellee suggested that Congress couldn't
legislate because these animals do not damage the federal land?
now they argue in their brief that Congress's legislation is
unconstitutional because these animals do in fact damage the
public land»
The statute that is in question here was enacted by
Congress , we -think, in the great tradition of the property
clausea

Congress found that these animals were components of

the federal land, and that's a fact that couldn't be disputed®
The animals® at least these equine animals, were found on 'the
North American Continent as long as millions of years ago0
They disappeared 10,000 years ago, and were re-introduced, in
studies that were before Congress showed, by Spanish
conquistadors in the early Sixteenth Century®
They have been roaming the Western Plains ever since,
but one thing that we don't argue and Congress didn't labor
under -the illusion that they were protecting an endangered
species®

As a matter of fact, the evidence shows that these

wild horses and burros are not really separate species from
domestic animals at all®
before Congress.

There's some contrary evidence

I don't think that the Committee Reports

credited that®

otherwise graze in.
But the prepetitions of 'that —* we're talking — the

individuals. The claims are still being processed.

They

claimed that they owned -them and they had just been set out.
If their claims are accepted, they will have to pay a trespass
fee, but they will let the animals back.
Congress also found that, as I said, these weren’t
special species, that most probably they had escaped or bean

Depression, when farmers and ranchers pulled up stakes and
left for the cities,

was startled about was that no studies have been done on that,

Mr. Randolph, I may have missed it, but

have you discussed your theory of how the government has the
power to exercise jurisdiction over the burros while they are
on private land?

MR. RANDOLPH;

Or of the property clause.

originated from committees in Congress that are composed of —
nearly all are representatives of Western States.

This is

26

unusual legislation.

It passed unanimously.

The notion that it upsets a great tradition of the
State is rather surprising, I think.

If there’s a tradition

of controlling these animals, it’s the tradition of the
Indian tribes and the United States Cavalry Remount Service
controlling the animalse not traditional State control.

There ar© more than 19 burros in that

QUESTION; And they are all unbranded, by definition.
MR, RANDOLPH; According to — surprisingly enough,
according to the Bureau of Land Management, on the federal
lands in New Mexico there’s a total of about 100 burros, wild
burros; that’s all.

And out of 'them, 64 are claimed by private

individuals as having owned them, even though they may be

There are very few in New Mexico.

So far as I'm awar© now, that's not written into his

QUESTIONs

Mr, Randolph, just so X5m perfectly

clear, you are suggesting that when we decide this case, we
need not tell a rancher who finds burros on his own private
land whether he should follow the federal procedure, calling
the federal people, or follow the State procedure, calling the
State people?

That's a question we save for some other case?

MR, RANDOLPH;

That's right.

If it ever comes up,

say 'that that practice of having animals that go onto private
land, wait until you get some official person to remove them

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Harris.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. HARRIS, JR.# ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HARRIS;

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court;
We are in agreement itfith counsel as to the single
question that we are faced with? and that's whether or not
the subject Wild Horse Act exceeds the power of Congress under
the property and commerce clauses? end we are in basic
agreement# I think# with him on the factual recitation that he
gave# with one or two minor exceptions# which I think I must
first address.
The common misconception among people who haven't
lived in the West or -the Southwest and had to do with the
ranching industry was expressed by counsel here this afternoon
in argument* drawing the distinction* as he did, between the
BLM land* public domain* and the fee land.
These burros# if Your Honors please# were found on
Kelley Stephenson*s ranch.

He, for 19 years, has been a

rancher in New Mexico# in this particular area, where he had,
as you’ll see from page 81 off the Appendix, on the plat, where

34
he had a relatively small ranch for 'that area, which consisted
of these 8,000 acres of BLM land,

But combined with that was

about 3,0Q0 acres of his own private fee land, and another
thousand acres of State*»leased land.

That comprised his ranch.

And, as you'll see, it’s bounded on —
QUESTIONz

When you say found on his ranch, that

includes the Taylor Grazing land?
MR. HARRIS;
QUESTION;

That is correct, yes, sir.
That's the common way of referring to

your ranch, is it?
MR. HARRIS;
QUESTION;

Yes, it is.

And —

So when you say it was found on your

ranch, you don't know whether it was found on Taylor Grazing
land or on fee land?
MR. HARRIS:

That is correct.

Except that this

record also contains the testimony of Kelley Stephenson, about
these burros in general, from which I think you might well -*»
QUESTION;

Is there some testimony that says

whether they — when he first found them they were -*» did he
ever find them on his fee land?
MR. HARRIS;

No, I think —=* he did not testify, nor

is there any evidence in the record, as to these particular
burros, that that was true. What he did say was that during
the 19 years he had bean -there he had known son® 8 or 10 of
these wild animals —

35

QUESTION;

Not -these burros , he never knew —

MR. HARRIS;
QUESTION;

No, sir, he didn't —
— no testimony whatsoever that these

burros were ever found on his fee land?
MR. HARRIS;

We will admit ‘that, Your Honor.

That is absolutely correct.
QUESTION; Well, then the district court is wrong in
that sentence that Justice Stavens quoted to Mr. Randolph?
MR0 HARRIS;

I think not, Your Honor.

I do not admit that they ware wrong, because of the
statement I was about to make, about the testimony in the
record from which I think the three-judge court might well have
drawn a reasonable inference 'that these were the donkeys that
had been seen in the past back up in the foothills on his fee
land.
If you’ll start — I think it’s at about

4? of the

record, where he talks about having seen wild donkeys over
to the east in the foothills on his fee land.

He said that’s

mostly where they .run, because that’s the better land, and
that's where they stay.

On these particular ones, tie first

time they were seen was at the Taylor Well.

That was spoken of.

And that was, in fact, on BLM land, and they were seised-by
the Livestock Board there.
I think counsel has adequately set forth the facts
in response to some questions propounded to him about his having

36

first mada a complaint, to the BLM people about the molestation
of his cattle by these donkeys. And his unsuccessful attempt
to do something about it -through BLM, which necessitated his
then going, of course, to the State authorities under our
State Estray Laws for relief? which he got.
Because, in accordance with our State laws, they pick
them up, and sold them at a public auction, as they have done,
I suppose, since Statehood in New Mexico.

A practice that's

common throughout the Western States.
The point has already been, made ebout the extension
of this Act onto privata land.

It covers not only public

land, it specifically covers private land in several
particulars.
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that this case raises

-that issue?
MR. HARRIS:

Yes, I do, Your Honor»

QUESTION; Why is that?
MR. HARRIS: Well, I do it because this whole
controversy arose out of more than just these 19 donkeys.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but what the issue ~ what
the complaint was about was — this arose out of the fact that
these 19 burros were taken from public land and sold.
MR. HARRIS;

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

But at page 66 of the Appendix, you will find a part of a
series of correspondence between one of the plain-tiffs in this

37

case, Mro Lee Garner, who is the Director of the New Mexico
Livestock Board, pointing up the real controversy that the
State of New Mexico is having with the federal government,
particularly the BLM, with respect to the wild Horse Act.
In the first, the very first paragraph he points out what the
State’s position is with respect to -these animals that are found
funning either on privata land or on public domain.
He claims ownership on behalf of the State of New
Mexico of all of them.

That is an issue in this case,

notwithstanding what government counsel has to say about the
narrow limited issues in the case.
QUESTION?

Mr. Harris, just so I have it in mind,

you brought a three-judge court complaint seeking a declaratory
judgment that the whole statute is unconstitutional.
MR. HARRIS:

That is correct.

QUESTION?

And this question about the 16 animals

and all 'the rest really goes to your standing to attack the
entire statute, rather than —
MR4 HARRIS?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You’re not appealing a condemnation order

or anything like that.
MR. HARRIS:

No# sir.

I’m not concerned particularly

with respect to this limited number of animals.
with the Act itself.

I’m concerned

I'm still with my declaratory judgment.

And that was the basis, I think, of the decision of the three-

38

judge federal court that struck it. down.
It was on the basis that there was no power given by
the Constitution to Congress under either the property or the
commerce clauses to regulate, as they did here, completely and
absolutely the control and, in effect,

for all practical

purposes, indeed the ownership,of animals.
QUESTION;

And you premise this, I gather, from that

first paragraph you referred us to, at page 66, that the State
has ownership of these animals, and whether 'they are on
federal land or on private land or on State land
MR. HARRIS;
QUESTION;

Indeed, Your Honor.
— the federal government has no power

of regulation?
MR. HARRIS; That is indeed our contention.

It has

been throughout, and was, in affect, the holding of the threejudge federal court in this.
QUESTION;

Mr. Harris, if you will turn to your

complaint in 'the Appendix at page 7, where you have paragraphs
6, 7, 8, all refer to what happened to Kelley Stephenson on
or about the 20th day of January 1974 with these particular
burros,
MR. HARRIS;
QUESTION;

Yes, Tour Honor»
I would think -that you really don't

have standing to challenge the whole sweep- of the Act unless
you can point to factual situations such as this where there

39

has been an actual conflict or where someone has actually been
harmed,
MR, HARRIS: Wellt of course,. I think the record does
disclose an actual conflict between the State government and
the federal government in this area, including the letter I
just made reference to of Mr, Garner’s,

As to who has the

jurisdiction cind the right to regulate and control these wild
animals.

The State contends that it does.
Now, it’s true that these allegations in those

particular paragraphs are limited to that factual setting9 but
that was simply background material to point up what the
controversy was which we think is justiciable, concerning which
we sought a declaratory judgment on the consti.tutiona.lity of
the entire Act,
QUESTION:

But doesn’t the. united States says that

whoever owns the burros, and that one of their answers anyway
is 'whoever owns the burros, the United States can certainly
keep people from taking the burros from 'the public property?
MR, HARRIS: The United States contends that, and wo
deny that they •»QUESTION:
MR, HARRIS:
QUESTION:

I know you deny it, -•~
Yes # sir, they do contend that,
— but if we agree with the United States

on that issue„ would ws need to go any further?

MR© HARRIS;

No, sir, I think not.

well, of course, perhaps it would be what you must look at to
determine that question is whether or not there was a
constitutional authority —
QUESTION;

Well, you corn.© back and say, Well, that

may ba so, but the Act also covers burros on private land©
MR. HARRIS:

Yes, sir, it. extends to that©

MR. HARRIS; We do, Your Honor©

That's a part of

the case ©
QUESTION:

As Justice Stevens says, it's in the case.

Or it suggests or asks©
MR. HARRIS;

Now, let m© point out —•

QUESTION: Before you leave that, Mr© Harris, let
me ask you one more question.

I suppose it isn't enough for

the State of New Mexico or for its Livestock Board simply to
want to have something adjudicated, you

in order to get a

declaratory judgment as to tha full sweep of a federal statute,

41
you've got; to show that it has a direct and an immediate impact
on you in some way# or at least on some of your clients# you
can't just say that Wwe disagree with the theory on which this
statute is enacted”,,
MRe HARRIS 3

Yes, sir»

And we think we have shown that here# if Your Honor
please»

In that# under State law# we went in# under our

Estray Laws# and we took possession of these animals while they
were on the public domain? animals that we admitted were
unbranded and unclaimed# and therefore fit the definition under
Section 2of this Act as wild burros»
And we sold them in violation of the specific penal'by
provision# Mrc Lee Garner did# the Director of the Livestock
Board# thereby subjecting himself to a $2#000 fin®

$2#000

and imprisonment for violation of Section 8 of 'the Act»
We think that that does make a justiciable controversy
with respect to the Act's validity»
QUESTION? Well# you can

certainly get an adjudica­

tion on what law governs that factual situation»

My question

is whether you can go beyond -that and say# "And now there are
a lot of other provisions of the law that aren’t relevant to
what Lee Garner did# or these 19 burros# but we want them
decided# too"*
MR 8 HARRIS;
Your Honor»

I’m sorry# I'm not sure I folic»? this#

42
QUESTIONz Well, the taking — for instance, the
taking of burros on private land* or that are claimed by the
United States Government, that it may regulate who may take
and who may take and who may not take burros from concededly
£e@ land, not lease land, not public land, but fee land»
That really isn't raised by what happened to Kelley
Stephenson»
MR, KARRISs Well, we think that it is, in the
sense that the three™ judge federal court had before it evidence
from which — and 1 mentioned this a moment ago —- I think they
could reasonably have inferred that these animals were at one
time on his fee land, and may have gotten over onto public
domain at the time they were noticed, at the time they
were picked up that's where they were.
Now, that brings ms to the point I was going to make
about how this Act has been extended to cover private land
by looking at th® difference between th® definition in the
Act itself, as to what is a wild hors® or a wild burro, and
the regulations which have been promulgated by the Secretaries
under it,
The definition of the Act is in Section 2(b)

%

53 all unhrandad and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands
of the United States",
But the definition contained in 4710,05 of the
Secretary's regulations promulgated under that go a great deal

•

43

further,,

They say that it means all unbranded and unclaimed

horses and burros and their offspring that have used public
lands on or after December 15, 1971, or *— and this is an
important phrase — or that do us® these lands as all or part
of their habitato
And I'm saying to you that these animals, upon this
record, fit within that last category»

N«, they are animals

MR» HARRIS;

And in this case*

Now, the —

animals, that the State is the owner of these animals, *—

MR* HARRIS;

MR. HARRIS;

That is true.
— if that is true, you win the case»
Yes, sir.

And that is true, whether

you’re talking about horses or burros or elk or deer or
whatever*

That is our position.
QUESTION;

Mr. Harris,•in that connection, let’s

assume for the moment that the government fenced in, say,
10,000 acres of its own land with fences so high that the
burros couldn’t leap it or get out of it.

Would the State

have authority, in view of your view that the State owns these
burros, to compel the government to take the fence down or
at least to allow the burros to leave?
MR. HARRIS?

Indeed.

That is our position. We

think that the State would certainly have that authority
under the decided cases of tills Court respecting ownership
of game animals.

I think that is true, yes, sir.

QUESTION;

MRo HARRIS;

Yes , but they said this about it — and

because they say it's a legal

its people that a State have the power to preserve and
regulate the exploitation of an important resourcea
QUESTIONS

Well, in that sense, the whole doctrine

of parens patriae is legal fiction, too, isn’t it?

QUESTION; Well, Mr, Harris, you say that the State
of New Mexico could take these donkeys off of the federal
property and kill them?
MR, HARRIS;

MR. HARRIS:

Yes, sir.

We indeed think that the

State has that right.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Just go in and kill them?
Wild animals.

MR. HARRIS:

Yes, sir? wild animals.

QUESTION: Welly what about wildlife in a national
park?
MR. HARRIS:

That’s in a completely different

category, because there you’re dealing with a different
categorization of federal land, you're dealing with lands
that have, in effect, been withdrawn, either by Act of Congress
or by cession from state «-»
QUESTION:

Well, does thes property clause read

differently for that kind of land?
MR. HARRIS:
situation is different.

Yes, sir.

I think definitely the

Thera, in most instances, you have

the consent of the State to the regulation by the federal
government of the animals on the national parks.

It's a

completely different situation.
QUESTION: What about the Migratory Gama Act, that’s
under what clause?
MR. HARRIS:

The Migratory Gama Act, if I can address

48

•that for just a moment, involves, or did involve, basically
t!i© same argument that we’ve got here with our donkey case„
Way back in 1914, I think was th© first federal court decision
on it, that came out of the State of Arkansas,

0. S, v,

?

Schafner, which is cited in the briefs,
Th® involved a 1913 federal Act, called th©
?

Migratory Bird Act, and the federal court there, in Schavnar,
struck it down as violative of th© Constitution,

And,

incidentally, both the property clausas and the commerce
clauses were relied upon by th© government for their authority
to pass that Migratory Bird Act,
That cas© was not appealed, 'that decision was not
looked at by this Court,
A year later, in th© State of Kansas, another
federal district court did exactly the same thing.

They

said that the property clause and the ccxnmarc clausa gives
no authority to Congress to pass a Migratory Bird Act, And
they did it on the basis of ownership of gam®,
Than in 1916, just a year after that, there was a
treaty entered into between Great Britain and the United
States involving the protection of migratory waterfowl between
Canada and the United States and Mexico,

That was a treaty.

And following that, Congress passed another Act, called th©
Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which was the subject of a litiga­
tion in Missouri v, Holland in IS20, in which it was held that

49
■fell® Congress did have authority to pass that, but it was the
treaty-making authority which gave it to them* it wasn't
the property clause which had been rejected in these two earlier
federal court cases* nor was it the commerce

clause* it was

the treaty power.
That’s not involved in our case. We don’t have
migratory fowl.

As

&

matter of fact* the three-judge federal
4

court so held.

We’re not talking a migratory situation with

these animals.

They tend to stay in one area* they don’t

migrate from State to State* and certainly not from country
to country* as do the waterfowl.
I think those cases support our view in this case.
I think the two earlier federal district court cases are
exactly the theory that we are asserting to this Court in
this case.

That the property clause and the commerce clause

do not give Congress authority to regulate in an area that
has* since Statehood* since nationhood* has belonged exclusively
to the States $ that is* the right to manage their gain® animals.
Mow* I have not touched the commerce clause* nor was
that discussed* I think* at length — or at all* for that
matter* by counsel for the government.
The commerce clause* as the lower court also found*
and it’s embodied in its opinion here* was not relied upon
by Congress in this case.

There is no congressional findings

at all with reference to it.

It isn’t mentioned anywhere in

50
the Act»

There isn't anything in this record — and, inciden-

tally# the federal government had the right to make a record
and to put on evidence in this case# and they declined to do
so» There is no evidence in this case# nor anywhere in this
record# as to any burdens of any kind that would be imposed
upon interstate commerce in this case with respect to these
animals»

That simply is not in the case»

And the lower court

so held# that the commerce clause was not involved»
As a matter of fact# the Act itself expressly bases
its provisions upon the property clause by simply saying —
tnat this# I think# is a novel theory — that these animals
ar® a part of the land» That is the fallacy# the false
premise upon which the whole argument of the government in this
case is based»

And it's asserted in a very short sentence on

page 9 of the government's reply brief# where they says
"These animals are part, of the public domain»"
They base -their whol property clause argument upon
the fact that these animals are part of the land»
Every case that they cite in their brief pertains
to situations where either# No. 1# the case is concerned with
a disposition or some control of the lands itself# or some­
thing that is related directly to it; and a part of it»

The

•Ashwander case, the T » V. Authority case# concerned government
dams and electrical energy»
They either fell in -that category of cases in their

52

,

brief* or they fell in the category of protecting the
government’s land against damage. And no one has any quarrel
with that.

Certainly the government; has the right to do so»
But all their cases are directed to that proposition.

They do not cite a case* nor have we found one* which stands
for this new and novel proposition that wild animals are a
part of the federal soil and therefore under our property
clause w@ have the right to Hite exclusive regulation and the
management and the ownership of them.
We think that the federal court was right in its
ruling.

Any reversal of that is going to have* I think* a

catastrophic effect with respect to all 50 of the States as to
their game regulation provisions * and certainly to the
Western States* where, as here* Nevada* who is represented
here at the counsel table today* there is some 86 percent of
the lands within its State boundaries that belongs to the
federal government* and in my State where more than a third of
it dees* ox- Alaska* where 90-plus percent of it does.
It’s going to have a staggering effect upon not only
the game management in all those States* but a tremendous
economic impact upon the cattle and the ranching industries
in all those States*-and particularly the Western States*
where* as here* the suggestion was made by counsel* all they've
got to do is put a litfcre drift fane® across the middle of
their ranch and protect their fee lands from these donkeys.

52
And that just isn't a practical solution to the
p rob Ism .
There being no constitutional authority to Congress
under either of these clauses,, we think that the lower court's
judgment must be affirmed»
Thank you»
