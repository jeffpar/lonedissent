ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURTON MARKS ON BEHALF
CF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARKSs
Courts

Mir. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

In this case Mr. Garner submitted some income tax

returns for the year 1965, 1966, and 1967, in which he
stated certain information which turned out to b® highly
incriminating to him in a trial which involved some activities
allegedly engaged in in 1968.

In 1965 he stated his occupation,

as required by the tax return, to b® professional gambler.
In .1966 and 1967 he stated he was a horseman but his wagering
income was, or his total income was stated to be as a result
of wagering income.
QUESTION:

Would ho have complied with the statute

if ha had inserted in the year in question the term Mselfemployed speculator”?
MR. MARKSs

Probably not.

It would depend, because

one of the interesting propositions with respect to income
tax reporting is when you define what you are or where your
income cam© from, you also define the consequences of what
types of.deductions you can us®.

Therefore, if Mr. Gamer

had — and I was speculating on this — defined himself as

4
a self-employed bankrobber, he may have been able to take
depreciation for his getaway car, whereas if he is a gambler,
the only thing that he could take®, as a deduction against wins
would be losses,
QUESTION:

How about tips?

Tips on races, wouldn't

that be, on your theory wouldn't that be —
MR, MARKS:
QUESTION:
MR, MARKS:

Yes.
Perhaps it might be.

That would be

within the scope of his business,
QUESTION:

Could he have answered th® question,

"I decline to respond or. Fifth Amendment grounds'*?
MR,, MARKS:
QUESTION:

As to his occupation?

that?

least,

whether -they did or not.

I really don't know

I really can't answer that question.

It seams that we are in between, and I have some
thoughts on. this situation.
. The case that we have- here appears to be in a sense
right in th© middle of what you would call — it's a Sullivan v.
Marchetti type of case.

That is to say — or Byars, if you

5
please., because Byers is a raors recant type of case.
3Sb© question really seems to be could Mr, Garner
assert his privilege against self «'incrimination at the time
he was prosecuted... or did he have to do it at the time that
h© was filling out his income tax return?
The majority of the Ninth Circuit seemed to indicate*
in my opinion* in a rather simplistic fashion that he had to
do it at the time he filled out his return* even though he
may or may not have known at the time ha filled it out that
the answers were incriminating or might foe incriminating»
According t© Judge Wallace of the Ninth Circuit* only Mr,
Garner would know whether his answers were incriminating at
the time he answered the question-

Well*

being

a gambler

is not an incriminating

answer..

Being a person who makes his wages through gambling or makes
his income through gambling is not incriminating.

It became

incriminating when Mr- Garner's income tax returns were
presented to the court and to the jury and certain inferences
were raised and argued by the prosecutor that these were
incriminating circumstances.
QUESTION2
Marks.

I don’t know that I follow you there* Mr.

If it was a link in the chain of causation at the

time the chain of inferences that would lead to th© judgment
that a crime had been committed * at: the time th® prosecutor
was arguing it to th,® jury* wouldn’t it have been the same

6
at the time he filed the return?
.

MR» MARKS*

.

«• .. i■:

.*

*

Well, he hadn't even committed the crime,

It*3 like being pregnant, or the concept of being pregnant.
Mr*» Garner would have to have known in 1965 that he was
thinking, if he was thinking, of committing a wagering viola­
tion in 1968.
QUESTION*

But then how was the fact that he

admitted to being a wagerer in 1965 incriminate him on the
charge that he did it in !6$?
MR, MARKS:

Well, that was one of the arguments and

one of the obj@ct.ions that was raised and

is a footnote in

our petition and in our brief that there is a subsidiary
question that was just glossed over, and that is how are
these returns admissible in any case?
QUESTION*
MR. MARKSs

That's from your Fifth Amendment.
Correct•,
But we also, because Haynes, Grosso, and

Marchetti had just coma out, the question of the Fifth
Amendment privilege as being applicable to the tax returns
was very vital, and that was an objection that w© raised, ‘and
that was what the Ninth Circuit finally landed and that’s the
important 'question which is here.
QUESTION*

What if the prosecution, instead of

putting in the tax returns to establish the fact that he was
a gambler had brought in three barfc@nde.rs who said over tills

Or refusal to answer on Fifth Amendment

grounds right in the return itself.
MB.» MARKS:

Well, then the return wouldn't be

admissible because it wouldn’t have any evidentiary value,
I assume.

Or based on another ground, and X forget the case,

you couldn't use the person's assertion of the privilege
against him as an inference of guilt, which is a different
subject altogether.
But I perceive in our case, and this is why it is
a very interesting proposition.

In Sullivan this Court

said many years ago you can't take the privilege against a
whole tax return.

In Marchetti where the Court said, and I

use it in quotes, "Where there is an area permeated with
criminal statutes where it's obviously incriminating," then
the person can assert the Fifth Amendment privilege at the
earliest opportunity — I mean, at th® opportunity where he
is being prosecuted, to wit, at trial.
specific holding of Marchetti.

And that was the

No question about it.

Assorted at trial.
Now, here we have an intermediate situation, but I

9
submit that it’s rea3.lv no 'different, Garner

is not different

from Marchettl becaus® the unconstitutionality of th© statutes,
if you please,? or the unconstitutionality, the pcirm@ati.on of
criminal criminality comes not from the face of the statute
which is fair, but either from its application by the
Government which admittedly uses tax returns for any purpose
it wants, in a tax case or a non-tax case,

In the appendix

and in th® Government regulations — the Internal Bav. is
26 C.F.R., which is cited — that’s all the Government attorney
has to do, the youngest assistant U.S. Attorney has to do,
is write a letter to the internal Revenue Service and say, ”1
want a copy of th© tax return of Mr» Garner, and it’s necessary.,9
that’s the only word he has to use?
investigation,” and

ha gets

"it’s necessary for ray

it,

Now, the propositiori is that the Government -- and
th® Government says in their brief,

"If you deprive us of

our right to go into a person’s confidential tax returns, you
are

'.hampering Government investigation.“

And what it means

simply is that tha minute Mr. Garner becomes the subject of
investigation, according to the Government’s theory, he
becomes th© suspect for any type of criminal activity and
he’s fair gam© for complete Government investigation ©ad
complete going into his tax return.

And therefor© th©

Government by writing a letter can circumvent the Fourth
Amendment and th© requirements of Boyd v. O.S.

They send the

10
letter and they say.,

"r©

want the income tax return,” then

they have the income tax return and under Calandra, just
recently decided, throw it into the grand jury and the grand
jury has this information that they can use, Mr. Garner
can't object.
Why doesn't the Government have to show probable
cause to get a copy of Mr, Garner's tax return?

tod if he

doss need probable cause, then aren't the regulations
promulgated by the Government equally unconstitutional on
their face?

That is to say, they ar© not in compliance with

the Fourth Amendment.

And the Government attorney in this

case should never have been permitted to get the tax returns
in the first placo in a nontax-related
case,
4

tod there'is

where the evil comes, and that1s why this is a Marchefcti
type case, not a Sullivan case.. And that's the reason why
Mr. Garner can only object at the time when he is faced with
the evidence which was presented against him at trial.
Because he never had a chance to object to the use of the
evidence before.

H© would never know that the Government,

th® U.S. Attorney, the FBI, and if you read the regulations
of the Treasury, you would be astounded at how many people
have access to your tax return.

And if you r@ca.ll, Mr.

Garner testified — and that's also in the record — he got
up in his defense, and that's th© only testimony he gave, he
thought his tax returns war© confidential,

tod I would wager

11
that if you took a — prior to some of the publicity that's
been coming out in recent months, but if you had taken a
poll sometime before? ths citizenry of this country, they
would have assumed that they had a sort of a pact with the
Government, they report truthfully and honestly what they have
done, the Government is going to withhold that information
and it's confidential and nobody else has a right to see it.
If they defraud the Government in their tax return,
then that's their problem.

Than the Government has a right

to go to the tax return to detect the fraud.

But otherwise

they do not.
Now, it seams to m@ that when you get this type of
Government activity which turns an Innocent tax return, fair
on its face, into the subject of constant investigation, in
other words, the parson investigated, whether or not he has
been accused or not accused, but merely the subject of
investigation, and his tax returns are available to the
investigators, to the U.S. Attorney's office, and this Court
is aware of the task force that have, for instance, a drug,
a parson suspected of drug activities, they hav® the Internal
Revenue Service working with them so the IRS gets them.

They

convene a grand jury especially for the purpose of subpoening
evidence that they otherwise couldn't gat.

They us© it for

investigatory purposes and then they turn the information over
to the law enforcement officials by virtue of this grand jury.

12
They have the tax people, they have the drug people, they have
the Department of Justice all working as a toast.

And this is

under some philosophies an appropriate method of investigating
what5 s- ..happen ing.
But to me it's discriminatory enforcement.
Yick Wo

all over again, but it°s hidden.

It is

It is a fair statute.

Everybody has to report, -'everybody has to state the information
truthfully.

But th© Government has to be fair also.

They

cannot take a serios of regulations and under the guise of
law enforcement or what they would like, to have take Internal
Revenue statutes and turn them into investigatory tools through
purported regulations which on their face are violative of the
constitutional guarantees of privacy.
Th® Government has a right to know certain information,
but the citizen has th© right to privacy.
QUESTIONs

Is there a constitutional guarantee of the

privacy of income tax returns, or is it a statutory prevision?
MR.

marks*

I believe that the constitutional guarantee

is there in the Ninth, and Tenth Amendments.

It is the right

to privacy, th© right not to disclose anything to th© Government.
If you are compelled to disclose it, then there is this
constitutional -- and I call it a sort of & social pact.

If

th® Government says, "We want information from you, you must
give it to us," th© citizen has a right to expect that th©
Government will not use that information against th® citizen

13
unless the citizen has defrauded or violated the pact with the
Government and produced untruthful information»
QUESTION:
MR» MARKS;

Whctt about grand juries under that theory?
Well, frankly, grand juries,! could

accept Calandra except for the fact they are controlled by the
United States Attorney55. office»
QUESTION:

But the fact of the matter is there are

cases over a long period of time that said the Government has
a right to everybody's testimony and there is no pact whatever
that if you tell the truth to -the grand jury, you won't, be
indicted,

if your truthful testimony reveals the fact you

have committed a crime.
MR. MARKS:

Yes, but there is the one protection

that the citizen has,to raise the privilege against self­
incrimination, and that's what your claim here is about.
And in this case, Congress has said in effect, or it
seems to be that Congress has said in effect, and also so has
the Internal Revenue Service, that you must answer every
question on the return and you must answer it truthfully and
as in, Garner's case, when he did in fact assart his privilege
against self-incrimination, the Internal Revenue Service
sent back a letter and said, "Your return is incomplete.
So by definition wa won't let you file the return and you
become a felon."

And that's the vice where you allow

- the

Government not only to be the judge, but the jury and all those

14
things as tc when the privilege can. 'be asserted.
the majority is wrong in the Ninth Circuit.

That ’s where

Garner isn't the

judge of "what's privileged or not privileged,, neither is the
Government.

What's privileged or not privileged is judged by

what the use of the material is at the time it's trying to be
used in a court at the time it's incriminatory.,
In the broader aspects, as I say, I believe that the
way the Government is acting, the way it*s administering an
otherwise fair statute, a reporting statuta, indicates that
it is making criminal statutes and using the Internal Revenue
reporting system as a method of enforcing criminal statutes
or investigating criminal violations, something which Congress
never intended

to be about to do and something which at least

in -the process in which it is being done, to write a letter
and say,

"I want this person's information," without having

an affidavit in support of probable cause to show that there
is reason.

It's just like the King’s warrant. "I want to see

what he put on his income tax report because maybe I will find
something incriminating, because this agent told me that ha
did something, so let me look at tha tax return."
the Government says on page 25 of their brief.

That's what

"If you let

this person assert his privilege against self-incrimination or
if you let him assert it at the time of trial, all this great
investigation, that we are now allowed under our own regulations
will go down the tubes.

We can't use it because, gae whiz, we

15
. sure need it,.11
QUESTION?

Really all that's involved here is the

admissibility in evidence at the trial of the tax return,
isn't it?
MR. MARKSs

Actually that's all we are really talking

about.
QUESTION;

Whether tax returns can be used for

investigation is another subject for another day, isn't it?
MR. MARKS:

Yes, but how did they get them into the

courtroom?
QUESTION?

What is involved here is the admissibility

in evidence at this trial of the tax return itself, isn't it?
MR,, MARKS s

That3 s the specific question here and

the question of whether or not I could object
QUESTION:

Why do you need to take on the question of

the us© of tax returns in preliminary investigation by
Government agency?
MR, MARKS;

That’s not involved in this case, la it?
It is, because if you are going to talc©

the Sullivan-Byers approach that there was nothing incriminating
at the time he made the statement, and.there is nothing
involved in a, permeated criminal statute, then Garner never had
a right to raise the Fifth Amendment objection at the time of
trial.

And I say if you. look at the way the statutes are used,

you get a discriminatory enforcexp.ent so that they are unfair
as applied rather than unfair on their face.

16
QUESTIONS

Welltr &s I say — you correct, me if I am

wrong — that I thought you said that I was correct in my
understanding that what is involved in this case is the
admissibility into evidence at this person, at your client's
trial of his previous tax return.
MR. MARKS :
QUESTION:

That’s right, but
So why is there involved here any of the

questions that you have talked about involving the confidentiality
of a person’s tax return?
MR, MARKS:

Because the majority said h© couldn’t

raise his Fifth Amendment privilege at trial, he had to raise
it at the time h© filled out his return.
QUESTION:

And feat’s the issue, whether or not he

was too late when at trial he objected to the admissibility of
the tax return.

That’s the issue, isn’t it?

MR. MARKS:

I Jm .analogizing this to Marchetti in this

sense that the statute

and the way that the income tax report­

ing statute is being used is discriminatory, therefor©
unconstitutional, therefore the Fifth Amendment applies as well
as it did in Marchetti because you are permeated with
Government use of unlawful use of the statute.
May I reserve some time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Mr,. Marks, before you sit down, before

you reach the ultimate question that Mr. Justice Stewart was
posing, don't you have the threshold question that’s critical

17
in this case as to whether or not the responses in the return
that concern you were compelled in a Fifth Amendment sense?
As I read Sullivan, they were not compelled.

Mow, I take it

you take a different view,, but I would like to hear you. discuss
that.

If they were not compelled, that comes pretty close to

answering the question put to you by Mr. Justice Stewart.
MR. MARKS?

They were compelled.

QUESTIONs

But why, in light of what Sullivan said?

MR. MARKS:

Well, Sullivan. ~ again I have to say

Sullivan was in 1925.
QUESTION:
MR., MARKS:

Right.
All right,,

We don”t know what questions

were raised at the time Sullivan was involved.

We don't know

whether they had distinctions between gambling income and
non-gambling income, what the tax consequences were if Mr.
Garner were to
occupation.

whether or not he really had to state his

I wasn't around.

The

point is —>
QUESTION:

You. mean whether the form had a question

asking for his occupation.
MR. MARKS:

You donJt know.

That's right.

It turns out that Mr.

Garner was compelled to answer each and every question because,
each and every question was determined by the Government, the
Internal Revenue Service, to have some bearing on the computation
of tax.

He has to answer them and h© has to answer them

18
truthfully»

It’s compslied»

There are some cases —

Sullivan just dealt with the entire return.

entire return.

Mr. Garner never

Marchetfci refused to file an

So you nave something right in the middle her®.

And I say that Mr. Garner was compelled„

And we have evidence

that he was compelled because when h© attempted to assert his
privilege in filing a partial return, the Internal Revenue
Service said, "It's no good and if you don't file a complete
return, you're going to be prosecuted for a felony.”

That seems

to me to be a compulsion.
QUESTIONS

I understood yeu to say that in two

earlier returns he gave some different answer.

Did I misunder­

stand you?
MR. MARKS;

That's right.

In the first, in 1965 he

said, "My profession is wagering, professional gambler."
1966 and in 196? he said "Horseman."

In

But whan they asked him

the source of his income in '66 and 967, ha said "wagering
income."

And Mr. Uelmen, the trial attorney, used that in his

argument, which is at page 58 of the appendix, to prove to the
jury that he was engaged in the business of betting and
wagering and to establish, if you will, an element of the
offense from the mouth of Mr. Garner from prior years.
Thank you, but may I reserve the remainder of my tiro.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Jones.

Very well.

19
ORAL ARGUMENT OP KEITH A. JONES ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. JONES:
Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Th® principal issue in this case and the only issue

that I am likely to have time to discuss at any length is the
issue to which Mr. Marks has addressed all of his attention,
that is, whether a taxpayer has a Fifth Amendment privilege
to exclude from evidence in a subsequent nontax criminal
proceeding his prior Federal income tax returns.
For analytical purposes in this case, we have
subdivided this principal issue info two separate questions.
The first of those is:

In what circumstances, if any, the

disclosures on a taxpayer’s income tax return may be said to
be compelled, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment?
the second question is;

And

What stand, if any, does the Fifth

Amendment require the Imposition of use immunity with respect
to disclosures that have in fact been compelled under the
Federal income tax laws.
I will address each of these questions in turn, but
with major emphasis on our contention that testimonial compul­
sion was lacking in the circumstances of this case.
Before I take up these questions, however, I xvould
like to at least allude uriefly to the significance of this
case to the administration of the tax and nontax criminal laws.
Our underlying concern in this case is that if this

20

Court were to hold in accordance with petitioner's arguments
here that a taxpayer's disclosures on his return ar© entitled
to automatic us© immunity, then in any nontax criminal
proceeding, the prosecutor would be subjected to the heavy
burden of disproving taint in any case in which he had had
an occasion to review the defendant's tax returns.,
might well be

a fairly large number of cases.

And those

As we explain

in our brief at greater length, pages 22 to 27, there ar© many
situations in which a prosecutor may have occasion to review
a defendant's tax return.

Th® easiest one to envision is

the case where a taxpayer’s returns have been forwarded to -the
U.S. Attorney by the Internal Revenue Service with th© request
that the defendant be prosecuted for tax crimes.

If the

defendant also has been under investigation for nontax offenses,
the nontax proceedings will then be subjected to inquiries

fox taint to determine whether any of the evidence has been
d©£ ived from th© taxpayer' s returns.

And there may be many-

other situations in which -there are incidental exchanges of
information between the Internal Revenue Service and the
Department of Justice which may give rise to claims of taint
if there was an automatic use immunity.
Now, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think, suggested that
that issue v/as not really involved in this case because what
we ar© concerned about is the possibility of an application
of the fruits doctrine whereas all that's at issue here is

21
the question of the admissibility of the tax returns them­
selves .

But looking into the future , we might find it

difficult if there were automatic us© immunity as to the
returns to distinguish cases like Counselroan

v

. Hitchcock

and. Kastigar which do require Immunity from indirect as well
as direct use of the compelled disclosures.
Those underlying considerations of practicality are,
eis I say, spelled out in our brief, and I won't enlarge further
\

upcn them here.

But I think that they are important

considerations that should play a significant role in the
Court's analysis

of this case.

QUESTION:

Is the availability of a person's tax

returns to agencies other than the Internal Revenue Bureau
all covered specifically and authorized by statute, or is it
a matter of regulation or just interagency understandings and
/

agreements?
MR. JONESi

Under the Internal Revenue Code the

President must authorize, and has done so through regulations,
the use of tax returns outside the Internal Revenue Service.
And we cite in our brief the pertinent regulations that
perrait the Department of Justice to have access to -the returns
in connection —
QUESTION %

I thought I remember reading that but I

can't find it. now.
MR. JONESs

I am now looking at the index and

22

we cite those regulations apparently on pages 25 and 36 of our
brief»
QUESTION!

Is it true as the petitioner says that

anybody in the U.S. Attorney’s office can get it?
MR. JONESi

The regulation provides that the

Department of Justice and the United States Attorneys have the
right to inspect the taxpayer’s return "where necessary in
the performance of official duties,”

So that they do have

access within the limits of that regulationa

MR. JONES:
Marshall.

Well, I wouldn’t think so, Fir. Justice

I. think this anticipates there would only be the

United States Attorney or perhaps an assistant United States
Attorney with his authorisation.
QUESTION:

There are thousands of United States

Attorneys, aren’t there?
MR. JONES:

That’s right.

QUESTIONS

It doesn’t say here that the U.S. Attorney

authorises it, it says that anybody can do it.
MR, JONES %

No, Mr. Justice Marshall.

We don’t

quote the full text of the regulation hers, but we do say that
the United States .Attorneys by regulation have the right to
inspect the return.

I think that they would hay® to authorise

a request from an assistant United States Attorney.

That’s

my understanding at any rate.
QUESTION;

and issue a subpoena duces tecum on anybody'

without approval of the U.S. Attorney?

Certainly.

He does

it every day.
MR. JONES;

That may well be.

I’m not sure what

bearing that has on the construction of this regulation.

And

I’m not sur® just what the exact terras of the regulation are.
QUESTION;
MR. JONES;

W© really don’t know.
That’s correct.

But there is broad

access for purposes of investigation of criminal activities.
With these general thoughts in the background» I
turn now to a discussion of the testimonial compulsion. And
in approaching -this question, it is helpful at the outset to
describe with some clarity the legal setting in which a
taxpayer completes and files his income tax return.

The taxing

24
statutes require that the taxpayer provide all the information
requested on the return and the taxpayer must, subject to the
penalties for perjury, attest by his signature that the answers
on his return are accurate and complete, and a willful failure
to fils a complete return subjects the taxpayer to prosecution
for a misdemeanor under section 7203 of the Internal Revenue
Cod© „
Now, petitioner and the dissenters in the court of
appeals perceive this statutory scheme as exerting testimonial
compulsion upon the taxpayer to incriminate himself,

They

reason that any refusal by the taxpayer to complete his return

on Fifth Amendment grounds would subject him to prosecution
for failure to file a return under section 7203 and that
that threat of prosecution would be sufficient to indue© a
taxpayer to forego a valid claim of privilege and thereby to
compel self-inorimination.
We believe that this conclusion reached by the
petitioner and the dissenters below is based upon a fundamentally
mistaken understanding of the scope of section 7203 and an
equally mistaken understanding of the pertinent constitutional
principles that apply here.
Section 7203 punishes only a willful failure to file,
and the concept of willfulness is crucial in this case.

Under

this Court's decision in United States v. Bishop, a taxpayer
cannot be convicted of a willful failure to file unless his

25

failure represents a voluntary and intentional violation , of
a known legal duty»

And a taxpayer who believes that his

privilege against self-incrimination justifies his refusal to
provide an answer on a Federal income tax return cannot b©
shown to have: violated a known legal duty within the meaning
of that phrase in the Bishop case, because such a taxpayer byhypothesis has a go oil faith belief that his statutory duty to
provide information has been constitutionally excused»
QUESTIONS

Mr. Jones, how do you reconcile what you

are telling us now with the experience that this taxpayer had
with respect to his 1973 return?
MR» JONESs

Well, 1 don't think it's very difficult
What happened was that he filed a return

assarting broad claims of privilege —
QUESTIONS
MR. JOBES;

With an explanatory letter»
With an explanatory letter.

The Service

determined that that was not a completed return as required.
At that point I will leap ahead in ray argument here to spell
out at some length what procedures were available to the
Secretary and what this letter represents.
If a taxpayer asserts a claim of privilege on a return,
it is incumbent upon the Service to secure th© information
necessary to complete th© return and determine the amount of
tax due.

And it does this first through

informal mechanisms

by sending a taxpayer a letter such as was sent to the

26
petitioner her®,
QUESTIONS

Threatening him with a criminal prosecution*,

the letter did,
MR, JONESs

Wall, I don"t think it’s fair to say

it was threatening him with prosecution, but pointing out
that a failure to provide might subject him, as indeed it
might if his claim of privilege was invalid and in bad faith,
to a criminal prosecution.
If the taxpayer continued to assert his claim of
privilege in informal conferences, the Internal Revenue Serviea,
if it determined that the privilege was not available, could
issue to him an administrative summons requesting that he
furnish the information,

And if the taxpayer continued to

assert his privilege as a basis for refusing to comply with
the summons, the Service would then be required to seek
enforcement of the summons in a district court,

And at that

point the taxpayer would h© entitled to an adjudication of his
claim of privilege.

If the district court recognised the

claim of privilege, detcjrmined it to be valid, then it would
refuse enforcement of th© summons.

At that point the Service

would, in order to secure th® information, have to award th®
taxpayer immunity under 18 U„SC, 6004.

And with the award

of immunity, of course, th© taxpayer could b© ordered fo
provide th© information sought in th© summons.
On the othsr hand, if th© district court determined

27
that the claim of privilege was not valid,, it could order
enforcement of the summons without an accompanying grant of
immunity„

But in either case, the taxpayer is subject to

compulsion only at the time the summons is ordered enforced
and not before.

And the petitioner in this case never

asserted his claim of privilege, he never invoked this
administrative process, a fortiori he was not compelled to
disclose information within the meaning of th© Fifth Amendment.

I go back to th® processes that would operate if
th® Service determined that the taxpayer's claim of privilege
were in bad faith.

At that time if it secured adequate

information on its own to determine the taxpayer’s liability
or that there was sufficient information from which it could
conclude that the claim of privi leg© was invalid. — ana; there sir.-.
by the way, many cases involving invalid claims of privileg©
by taxpayers who wish to assert such a claim of privilege as
a basis for not filing a return at all — the Service could then
bring a prosecution.
But as 1 have pointed out, that prosecution could be
successful only if it was established not only that the
taxpayer's claim of privilege was invalid but also that the
taxpayer knew that it was invalid and that he was making it in
bad faith, merely as a means of avoiding payment of his
Federal income tax liability.
In other words, th© sanctions imposed by the -threat

28
of a prosecution under section 7203-place no burden on the
exercise of a valid claim of privilege or even upon a claim
of privilege -that the taxpayer erroneously believes to be
valid,

ted therefore section

7203, the enforcement mechanism

in the Code* does not coerce the taxpayer
claim that he believes to b© valid.

into foregoing a

It does not compel the

taxpayer to incriminate himself.
*

Tie think that this analysis isibuttressed

by this

Court's prior decisions under the Fifth Amendment, in
particular the situation of a taxpayer completing his return
may be fairly analogized to that of a witness in a civil
proceeding.

Both the taxpayer and the witness are confronted

with authoritative directives to furnish information.

I have

already outlined the directives that are addressed to the
taxpayer.

Those that are addressed to the witness are very

similar.

Often the witness will hav© been summoned by legal

process to appear and give testimony,

ted at the time of

giving testimony, h® is required to affirm, subject to the
penalties for perjury, that he will tell the whole truth,

ted

if necessary, the judge will instruct him that he has a duty
to provide evidence and that his refusal to do so may subject
him to the punishment of contempt.

-

In other words, the judge

may, like the Service in fch© case of the petitioner, threaten
the witness with the possibility of punishment if the information
is not forthcoming.

29

If the circumstances, therefore, faced by a taxpayer
and & witness are not identical? certainly closely comparable.
We believe that the same constitutional rule should apply in
each case.
The rule for witnesses is clear.

This Court has

held and reaffirmed in a number of cases? most recently in
United States v. Kordel, that self-incriminatory testimony
given by a witness in an ordinary civil proceeding may fo© used
against him in a subsequent criminal trial.
The reason for this rule? or the basis for this
rule? was set forth and explained by the Court in a case called
United States v~ Monia? at least I think

that9s the pronuncia­

tion of it? M-o-n-i-a, and we quote from that opinion on pag® 15?
and I would like to repeat it because it bears directly upon
our case as well.

stated:

"Th© Amendment speaks of compulsion.

may incriminate him.

If? therefore? h© desires the protection

of the privilege? h© must claim it or he will not be considered

That is our contention hare.

If the taxpayer does not

assert his privilege?if he does not claim his privilege)? h©

30
cannot be considered to have been compelled at the time of
completing and filing his return.
QUESTION?
MR. JONES;

A waiver... irrelevant.
That's right.

at all in terms of waiver

,

We don't discuss this case

but merely in terms of the absence

of testimonial compulsion, which I think is the way this Court
has analyzed analogous cases in the past.
Precisely the same consideration should govern this
case as wall as the case of the witness in the ordinary civil
proceeding.

Although a taxpayer is under some official pressure

to complete and file his tax return, pressure such as the letter
you have mentioned, Mr, Justice Stewart, just as a witness is
subject to some official pressure to testify., the crucial point
in each case is that the pressure is not such as would override
or nullify a valid tiitjsly asserted claim of privilege.

In

neither situation is a sanction imposed upon, a taxpayer or the
witness for asserting a valid claim of privilege.

Thus in

neither situation can answers furnished without any claim of
privilege be treated as having been compelled within the meaning
of the Fifth Amendment.
And this conclusion, w© think, is further supported
*•

v

by contrasting tills situation with thos© in which this Court
has found testimonial compulsion in the past, and perhaps the
most pertinent example is the case of Garrity v. New Jersey,
In that case a police officer was informed or was requested to

31
testify in an inquiry into alleged traffic ticket fixing. And
he was informed that if ha refused to testify that he would be
removed from his office.

And under this threat the policeman

did testify and in doing so he incriminated himself.

The

incriminatory disclosures were then introduced in evidence
against him in a subsequent criminal proceeding arising out of
the inquiry.

And this Court determined that those disclosures

were not, admissible against the policeman in his trial,
reasoning that the policeman's desire to remain silent had
been overborn© by th© threat of a sever® economic sanction
placed upon the very exercise of a valid claim of privilege.
In other words, in that case if th® policeman, Garrity, had
claimed his privilege, ha still would have been subject to the
sanction of removal from office.
In this case, if the petitioner had claimed his
privilege, h® would have been subject to no such sanction,
even if his claim of privilege, I might add or reiterat®, was
invalid so long as he in good faith believed it to be a valid
on©.

Accordingly, unlike Garrity, we believe that the taxpayer

in this case,, the petitioner, was not subject to any compulsion
to incriminate himself.
Before going on to the second question

that I've

raised, I would like to further point out that even if in this
case this line of reasoning was rejected and it was concluded
that the directives addressed to a taxpayer at th® time he.

32
completes and files his return do represent testimonial
compulsiono there was no compulsion upon th® petitioner in this
case to incriminate himself.

As we explain in footnote 13 of

our brief, on page 23, the disclosures mad® by th® petitioner
on his tax returns, as Mr. Marks has conceded hare, were not
incriminating when made and the privilege against self-*
incrimination only protects against the compelled disclosure
of self-incriminatory information, it does not protect against
the compelled disclosure of information that is not incriminat­
ing but that only becomes incriminating because of th© subsequent
criminal activities of the witness.

So that in this case,

even if it were found that testimonial compulsion is present,
there was no testimonial compulsion to incriminate in this case.
I would also mention that th© kinds of disclosures
that were made here were not such, as we have shown in our
brief at, I think, pages 42 to 45 —
QUESTION;

You ar© speaking now of the answers

"Horseman" and those othsr answers he had given in previous
years ?
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;
MR. JONES;

That's right.
Those war© not.
Those answers did not themselves

constitute the admission of any criminality, nor did they form
a link in a chain of evidence with regard to any crime that we
know of as of the date that the tax returns were completed.

33
The conspiracy for which th@ petitioner was prosecuted for
his participation in it began in May of 1968.

His last tax

return that was introduced in this trial was filed in April of
'68 for the preceding year of 1967.

So there were no-’self-

incriminatory disclosures made on this taxpayer's return
whether or not he was subject.to testimonial compulsion.

Yes, it indicates that at the time these returns were

But 1 don't believe

that under California law it would be illegal to be a gambler
if your gambling activities, in fact, were taking place in
Nevada, or indeed there may wall be gambling activities in
California that can fo© engaged in.

At. any rate, there is no

allegation here by petitioner that those answers were

34
incriminating when made, and indeed, as I indicated earlier,
Mr. Marks has conceded that they were not in fact incriminating,.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Jones, I notice your footnotes to be

Is there a difference?
o

v

MR. JONESs
QUESTIONS

Weil, I would —
What you say is even if the taxpayer j>3 to

be permitted to invoke the privilege for the first time at
trial, he should ba required to establish not only the pravior;
disclosure now las a potential for incrimination but also that
it had

that potential when mads.
MR. JONES?

Well, by that I think w© meant potential

for incrimination means that the taxpayer doesn't — that any
person asserting a claim of privilege does not have to show
actual incrimination but only the potential of incrimination
if his answer were provided.

And all we meant to say was that

the situation at the time of filing the return has to be th©
same as the time of subsequent use.
I turn now to the second question, that I undertook
to address at the beginning of this argument, which is to
what extent, if any, the Fifth Amendment requires the
imposition cf us© immunity with respect to disclosures -that have
in fact been compelled under the Federal income tax laws.
Time doss not permit a full discussion of this issue, and I
can do little more than outline the arguments that w® sat forth

35
at some length at pag.es 21 to 41 of our brief.

But w©

suggest there that in the context of the neutral self-reporting
requirements of the Federal income tax laws the Fifth Amendment
requires the imposition ©f us® immunity only with respect to
those compelled disclosures that constitute, that entail, a
substantial risk of prosecution and that th© only disclosures
on a tax* return that entail such a risk are those that involve
a direct admission of criminality when made.

And th®

relatively innocuous disclosures that petitioner made on his
tax returns in this case clearly do not meet that test.

His

disclosures that ha was a gambler, that h© made money as a
gambler, were not admissions of criminality as such.
Mow, our suggestion along these lines draws in
large part from this Court's decision in California v. Byers

in which it was held that a driver involved in an accident
could be compelled under a-State hit-and-run statute to make
certain disclosures, and, that those disclosures could be used
against th© driver in a subsequent criminal proceeding arising
out of th© accident.

Although there was no opinion for th©

Court in 'that case, both th© plurality opinion and the concurring
opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan evidence a concern that selfreporting requirements that further a legitimate nonprosecutorial
Government purpose might be substantially hi.nde.rad or frustrated

by assertion?? of privilege based upon a mere possibility as
contrasted with a substantial probability ©f incrimination.

36
We think that that concern is also appropriate her®.
Under the standard of incrimination applicable in
the criminal context, mirier th® so-called Hoffman test
propounded by this Court in United States v, Hoffman,, a refusal
to comply with a request for information or a refusal to
testify may be based upon even a very attenuated risk of
incrimination*

And we fear that widespread refusals to

answer questions on tax returns based upon that relatively
permissive Hoffman standard of incrimination could seriously
disrupt th© administration of the taxing laws»
Now, if, as I have spelled out in the earlier part
of my argument, th© procedure to be invoked is on© of
administrative summons and a determination of th© validity
of claims of privilege, th® administration of the taxing laws
could be seriously disrupted by fraudulent, invalid claims
of privilege that require a lengthy administrative and
judicial hearing before th® information necessary is finally

secured.
If, on 'the other hand, a higher standard of incrimina­
tion is required in the self-reporting context that we are
*t

<

considering her©, then it would' be clear what questions on the
return might entail a substantial risk of prosecution and
thos-i: which would not.

And w® suggest in our brief that the

only questions on a taxpayer's return that th© answers to which
are likely to entail a substantial risk of prosecution are those

37
that: relate to the sours® of miscellaneous ineom© or possibly
occupation, although that saeras somewhat unlikely.
We feel that permitting th® invocation of the Fifth
Amendment privilege only on th© basis of the higher standard
of incrimination that we suggest would afford a substantial
measure of protection to all individual taxpayers while at
th© same time not significantly impairing the Government’s
ability to secure and use the information it needs in raising
the revenue*
