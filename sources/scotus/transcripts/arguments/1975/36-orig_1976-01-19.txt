MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Wo. 36 under our

original jurisdiction,

the State of Texas against the State of Louisiana.
Mr, Hill.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. HILL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF STATE OF TEXAS
MR. HILL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The major unresolved issue lie fore us is which of
two proposed lateral boundary lines should be adopted by
the Court in its final decree that would, in the Court's
judgment properly fix the Oulfward extension of the lateral
boundary between the States of Louisiana, the State of Texas
and the United States.
Now, during the trial before the Master in New
Orleans, which constitutes almost 1,200 pages of testimony
and a large number of exhibits,

there were many lateral

lines that were in contention and that were proposed by the
parties, but the only two lines that are still viable and in
contention are the Texas so-called

"middle line" or "median

line," which begins at the mouth of the River Sabine, the
natural mouth of the River Sabine and extends gulfward three
leaaues on a middle line or median line principle, which we
believe to be the only correct and equitable line that will

4

fairly divide the territorial sea between these two states
which is all we seek to do, which is all we can seek to do,
«4

is just

fairly divide this territory.
OUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, before you get to

that, I understand there is no dispute of the area of the
river now between 30 and 32 latitude.
MR. HILL:

None at all.

QUESTION:

And you refer to 12 maps that have

I

been agreed upon and cipparently are to be deposited with the
land departments of each state.
Do you expect us to incorporate those maps in our
decree here?
MR. HILL:
an agreement.

Yes, we do,,

We do not speak of it as

We speak of it as the ascertainment on the

ground of the facts and legal principles that this Court has
already enunciated in your first opinion.
QUESTION:

Well, do you expect us to incorporate

them in the decree?
MR. HILL:

Yes, we do.

The only controversy left

down to the natural mouth of the river involves —
QUESTION:

I know what the only controversy is.

MR. HILL:

I'm sorry.

the decree if they are not here?
MR. HILL:

Yes, they are in the exhibits, if it

language,, or do we have to work it out ourselves?
MR. HILL:

No, sir, we would be happy to do so.

We think that the proper decree — since the Court's proper
decree here should be that the latex'al extension, gulfward
extension shall be a ruddle line or median line extending
from the mouth of the gulf, it would be sent back for that
principle and

we have plotted a coastline.

We think the

proper coastline is the historic coastline, as we say, but
I think the proper decree would be for us to do that and at
the same time you settle the middle path issue for us.
QUESTION:

I know what the issues are.

MR. HILL:

Yes, sir.

Stewart's opinion, Justice White's opinion in the first
round of this case.

and I -just want to —
MR. HILL:

Well, sir,

the difference between

what is before the Court on the exhibit and what is in the
Master's exhibit, aside from the obvious enlargement, is the
Louisiana arc and the fact that the only two lines we put on
this map are the lines still in contention.

You will notice

on the Master's exhibit there are many other lines .

There

is no use clogging up this discussion with lines that every­
one has abandoned.
The only reason for putting the arc in, in your
previous decrees you have decrees that Louisiana is entitled
to measure the breadth —
QUESTION:

Yes, but there is no facsimile of that

in our papers that I can look at rather than try to read from
here, and I can't.

I can’t see it.

MR. HILL:

If you could Mr. Justice Brennan, if

you will refer to the Master's exhibit but ignore all of the
lines that are on it, except what is designated, I believe,
line number one, the Texas median line and the U.S. line
which is line number —
QUESTION:

Five.

8

MR. HILL:

Five.

It is otherwise the same with

the exception of drawing the Louisiana arc and we did that
solely to refresh the memory of the Court of one unique
feature of this controversy and that is, by previous decree
this Court has said that Louisiana may measure the breadth.
It is a very important point in this case which
was overlooked by the Master and specifically overlooked by
the United States and Louisiana.,
o

Your decree states that Louisiana may measure the
breadth of her territorial sea from that jetty.

That

decision had nothing to do with where the lateral boundary
would be in that territorial sea or in our territorial sea
but we wanted to put it in here so you could see that the
Louisiana territorial sea is rather unusual in that it comes
on an arc and then joins in their three-mile line which, of
course, they are taking under the unconditional grant of the
Submerged Land Act.

They take in three miles — which they

tried to take an historic three leagues.

It was rejected by

this Court.
We tried to take an historic three leagues and it
was affirmed by this Court.
So you have a state on the one hand with a threeleague grant already established by this Court and Louisiana
on the other hand with a three-mile grant but allowing them to
measure that three-mile grant from the eastern edge of the

9

jetty under the Geneva Convention hopinq that that was a part
of their coastline so that actually they have a territorial
sea on breadth.

It is a very unusual-looking animal as a

result of those two cases so that is what this map is for.
hope it will be useful as we go along in our discussion.
QUESTION:

Is there a map in the briefs or in the

Because you are in contention, between

you and Louisiana, as to where the line begins at the upper

MR. HILL:

There is, in the record -QUESTION:

Is this the —

MR. HILL:

Well, Justice Blackmim has a larger

exhibit that he is referring to, Justice Stewart,.
Now, the only significance,, as long as we are on
that point and the Court is now expressing an interest in it,
middle path is clearly the: proper path to mark the geographic
middle of the river at that point.
, The only reason that Louisiana ever contended
that the west path should be used was because Louisiana
owned some islands, or claimed to own some islands west of
the middle path.
The Master properly found that is totally
immaterial to the question of where the geographic middle of
the river is, whether there are some islands west of it or
east of it.

11
QUESTION:

South between -— you aren't in

contention -- the two states are not in contention south of
that until you get to the Gulf?
MR. HILL:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. HILL:

And then the middle path I think

clearly is going to be the judgment of this Court.
So we come on down then to the major issue in
dispute which gives us about 12„000 acres of offshore lands
that are in dispute in the area that the United States is
affected by out here, beyond the Louisiana

arc and some

7,500 acres in the little triangle here that is in dispute
and that, when you get down to it, is what the lawsuit is
about.
It's Texas position that Texas has had a lateral
boundary, three marine leagues seaward into the Gulf in this
now contested area, ever since the 1845-'49 period.
I am sure the Court knows why in this side of the
litigation we refer" to the 1845-'49 period as related to
Texas.

I'll pick that up in a little while.

There is a very

good reason for it — most everyone has written on this
subject or read these, that we were deeded this little sliver
from the United States Government from the west bank to the
middle of the river in 1843.

It has the same standing

historically, by the vary terms of the Submerged Land Act as

12

our original historic grant so when I speak of 1845-'49, that
is why I am using that term.
The United States, incidentally, agrees with the
position that I just stated,.

They agree that Texas had a

historic thrae-league lateral boundary and they concede this
in their brief.

They argue with the fact that it was not

precisely limited and we'll get to that in just a moment but
the position, of course, our basic position, is based on a
number of historic items and this has been so well-documented
in your previous cases that I feel a little bit imposing on
the Court to go over all of it and I'll try to hurriedly do
so.
Of course, first, the United States is a party
to this litigation and the State of Texas is a party to this
litigation

entered a stipulation that appears at 394 U.S. 1

which was the third chapter of the second United States
versus Louisiana case and this is what it .said.
"The United States has accepted Texas' three
league boundary opposite the western half of Sabine Pass,
not as a boundary as it existed when the state came into the
union in 1845, but as one approved by Congress before the
passage of the Submerged Land Act and as such, equally
entitled to recognition under 23, section 2B of the Act.
"The line identified in the stipulation as the
line to be recognised as Texas off-shore boundary includes

13

the 1849 extension but the United States reserves the
effectiveness of that extension as against the claims, for
example, that might be asserted by Louisiana.”
All right, that reservation was carried out.
Louisiana made a contest of it and that is what the original
opinion in this case dealt, with, is whether it was valid
against Louisiana's claim and this Court held that it was.
That is already decreed law by this Court.
In the face of Louisiana's contest, you rejected
their claim of the west bank and judicially decreed Texas
historic boundary to which the State of Texas and the United
States had already agreed.
So louisiana's contest had been rejected and the
stipulation of the United States is

still binding on them.

Now, that historic boundary, of course, is based
on a lot

of historic documents.
Again, just so hurriedly because it is so much a

part of the previous cases, our 1836 Texas Boundary Act was
the fundamental historic document that from and after the
passage of this act, passed when we were an independent
nation and a republic, the civil and political jurisdiction
of

this republic be and is hereby declared to extent to the

following boundaries, to wit:
Beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River and
running west along the» Gulf of Mexico three leagues from

14
land to the month of the Rio Grande and so forth.
When Congress annexed us as a state in 1845, this,
mind you, was the territory that the Republic of Texas
considered ;

"It was properly included within its boundaries

and rightfully belonging to the Rebuplic, that beginning at
the mouth of the River Sabine three leagues gulfward to the
mouth of the River the Rio Grande."
What did

Congress say when they annexed us?

That

"Congress does consent that the territory properly included
within

and rightfully belonging to the Republic of Texas

may be erected into a new state."
It did say,"Subject to the adjustment by this
government of all questions of boundary that may arise with
other gove rnments . "
You remember the history that the United States
was concerned about where the western boundary of our state
would be

whore the boundary would be with f1exico and they

'wanted to press every claim that Texas rightfully had
against all contestants and participants and that is why that
language was used.
There was never any contest over our eastern
boundary, never.

The only contest that has ever arisen about

it is that Louisiana has rejected claim that we didn't own
half of the Sabine River.
We came along to the treaty that we then entered

15
into with Mexico.

Following this series of events, the

language that was in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo said,
"The boundary line between the two republics

shall

commence in the Gulf of Mexico three leaaues from land
opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande and from thence," and
so forth.
"Three leagues...."

"river."

There can be no question any longer about the fact
that we had our historic boundary and there can be no question
about the fact that that boundary included a lateral boundary,
whether or not Congresss sadd — when it said, "Beginning at
the middle of the ^iver Sabine and to a line three leagues -—"
the mere fact that it didn't stake it out by some call or
some precise delimitation, we believe does not defeat the
fact that Texas had and hcd to have an historic lateral
boundary connecting that beginning point and that ending
point at that time.
QUESTION:
after Texas

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was

was annexed, wasn't it?
MR. HILL:

Yes and you do remember -- of course I

didn't read it but I didn't think it was necessary when they
moved our line over, the United States in 1848 Congressional
Act consenting to the extension of the line, it said, "Also
one-half of the Sabine River from its mouth."
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, are the parties in

16

agreement as to what the situation would have been prior to
1948 when the boundary was on the west bank of the river as
to how you would get from shore to three leagues out, what
angle would be appropriate?
MR. HILL:

It is our position, your Honor —

QUESTION:

I am asking if the parties are in

agreement as to what the line
MR. HILL:

would have been prior to 1848.

I would say that there is no longer any

dispute in this case that the only proper way to construct
the lateral boundary is by use of the so-called "median
principle."
QUESTION:

How would the median principle

operate from the west bank of the river?

That is what I

wasn’t quite clear on.
MR. HILL:

The west bank of the river?

If that

were still a contended-for line, which it isn't, you’d simply
step out and .adopt the same so-called "shallow? width
principles."
Really, the way a median line is drawn, if you
go s.o sea and you find a place that is close to where you
are shooting for, and yoii shoot to the nearest point on each
shore that you are nearest to, then that is your beginning
point.

And you step in on an arbitrary kind of ad hoc basis

;»o that you keep that line all the way to its connection
point where every point on that line is no closer to one

17

coast than it is to the other and of course, the obvious
reason is, what you are trying to do is equitable to divide
the seabed and that is the only kind of line that does it.
QUESTION:
differently.

Let me put my question a little

If the line had originated

on the west bank

of the river instead of in the middle of the river, would it
have been parallel under that principle to a line which
originated in the middle of the river?
MR. HILL:

Yes, sir, there wouldn't be very much

difference if that — let's say academically -- if that is
what we were fighting about in this case we wouldn't have
very much to fight about, because the principle of the line
would be the same, you'd just have a different connection
point with some maybe a quarter of a mile to the west of
them but you project the line exactly under the same
principles.
It was spoken of as a middle line back at the time
Texas was annexed and I'11 get to that in a moment but the
only concept of any of the so-called "middle line” or median
line is that what you are trying to do is to divide the pie
fairly.
halfers.

That is all it is about.

You are trying to go

You are trying to do equity on both sides.
No one denies that the Texas line shown on this

map does that.

No one.

The line is

proper.

It connects

a historic middle and it divides it in an equitable way.

18

When you take the United States line, which
has now been joined in by Louisiana, you use the jetties,
which were not developed on median principle lines at all.
They have nothing to do with equity of dividinq a sea bed.
They were built by the United States Corps of Engineers for
the purposes of the Uniter States Government in navigation.
They don't evert purport to follow a median line and when you
move down and start at that position, you destroy the
principles of median principle because you have such narrow
base lines it is meaningless.
If you take two small base lines to construct a
median principle off of you might as well just draw a straight
line.

It is going to come out substantially the same.
So unfairness is injected into this case by the

use of man-made jetties constructed by the United States
Corps of Engineers in 1880 when they were begun after our
historical boundary was already recognized which did equity
to everyone and now we are put in the position that we are
being said that we have given up part of our entitlement
because in some way we have acquiesced — we have acquiesced,
says the Master, as his primary basis.
The State of Texas has acquiesced in aiving up
this valuable land that would be ours under that principle
because we have acquiesced in moving our boundary line down
the jetty to the mouth.

19

Now, how ridiculous can you get?

more onto it?

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General --

MR. HILL:

-- to the changing of our boundaries.

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, on your theory,

had the river come in to the Gulf directly due east, then the
median line would also go directly due east.
MR. HILL:

Not necessarily directly due east,

Justice Blackmun, because you don't measure a median line
from the channel of the river and extend the channel of the
river out.

You use the coast line, draw the baseline, the

proper baseline.
QUESTION:

No, suppose the two shoulders had been

north and south of one another at the point of the mouth of
the river?

Does not my question demand a positive answer?

MR. HILL:

you would establish it, not by reference to the channel or
the thalwick, so-called, of the river; you would establish

MR. HILL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

It might change -*- if you had a fairly

long baseline, it wouldn't make much difference which way —
what direction the river v7as running when it went into the -MR. HILL:

No, sir, particularly if the coastline

was more or less regular and I don't think anyone claims that
Louisiana and Texas

has a substantially irregular coastline,

as coastlines go and what is happening here is after they
can't sustain the acqiescence

in prescription because the

evidence is weak, the law is weak, you don’t take something
away from someone on acquiescence in a small 25-year period,
which is all that we are talking about, on the basis that
some shrimpers have given affidavits that they got arrested
or bought some fishing license in a certain area.
That is just weak as water and it won’t hold and
there is not enough evidence here — this Court has repeatedly
said that if you are goinn to apply proscription and acquies­
cence -- which you don't even favor as a rule — you are slow

21

to do it in a boundary involving water, much slower than in
land and I just don't know of a case where you take this
kind of evidence that has been presented here with such a
short period of time and ignore all of the other documentation
and history and case law here and just override it on some
basis of prescription we have agreed that the mouth of that
river could be shifted down.
Now, losing on that point, we get into a —- the
United States takes the position, and the Master agreed that
since Congress did not more accurately delimit our lateral
boundary line back in those historic times, that it must be
discarded in favor of a modern line which would take into
account these modern jetties.
Now, we have set out in our briefs -- and please
remember that we have a pretrial brief, a post-submission
brief as well as our brief in support of qur exception, all
of which we would commend because we shortened our brief down

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. RUPP, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES
MR. RUPP:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
There is no longer any dispute between the parties
here that the boundary between Teiscas and Louisiana and the
Gulf must be constructed by reference to the median line or
equidistant principle contained in Article 12 of the Geneva
Conventions.

That is, that the boundary must be a line that

is at all points equidistant from the coastlines of the two
states.

28

The dispute relates instead to the coastlines for
purposes of application ol: the median line principle.
Texas' basic position is that the relevant coast­
line is the coastline that existed in 1845 when it was
admitted tc the union.
In support of that position, Texas has contended
first that the congressional resolution annexing Texas
recognized that Texas had in the Gulf of Mexico both lateral
and offshore boundariesj that had Congress undertaken to fix
that boundary as of 1845, it would have used the equidistant
or median line principle and it would have applied that
principle to the 1845 coastline and finally, that even though
Congress did not fix the lateral boundary in 1845 or there­
after, the boundary nevertheless remained inchoate and neither
post-1845 evulsive changes in the coastline nor post-1845
changes in domestic and international law can operate to
effect the position of the lateral boundary which has
remained in some sense established since 1845.
We believe that the Special Master properly
rejected Texas’ positions and that all three of the conten­
tions made by Texas in support of that position are
demonstrably unsupportable„
The operative language that Texas relies upon in
support of its argument that it has had for the last 140
years a lateral boundary in the Gulf of Mexico appears at

29

page 7 of our brief and it was referred to by my brother a
moment ago.
That language, which is taken from the Texas
Boundary Act, reads as follows, describing the seaward
boundary of the State of Texas:
"Beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River and
running west along the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from
land to the mouth of the Rio Grande."
%

And United States versus Louisiana, decided by
this Court in 1960, this Court held that the language to
which I have just referred is sufficiently precise to sustain
Texas' claim to an offshore grant under the Submerged Lands
Act extending into the Gu3.f of Mexico three: leagues from
land.
At the same time, however, this Court recognised
in that case that at the time of Texas' annexation, Congress
paid preciously little attention to the location or distance
of any offshore boundaries for the State of Texas.
As the Special Master noted, they paid no
Congress paid no attention at all to the location of lateral
boundaries.

The consuming interests at that time were

instead the question of slavery, the debt that had been
accrued by the Republic of Texas and our deteriorating
relations with Mexico.
Texas has painted to nothing in the available

30

legislative history that adds to the languc’ge to which I
have referred and I think that Special Master — we submit
that the Special Master was correct in concluding that it is
impossible on the basis of the operative language upon
which Texas relied

— it relies —- to construct a lateral

boundary.
As the Special Master noted, the problem is
getting from the mouth of the Sabine to the point three
leagues into the Gulf — and I am quoting —- "No meridian
is chosen.

No angle of departure from the coast is

referred to, nor is any point in the Gulf three leagues from
land specified."
Given the total lack of relevant language in the
statute, there is no indication of how or where a lateral
boundary was to be constructed.
What the Special Master was confronted with, then,
was a holding

by this Court that Texas’ off-shore boundary,

the breadth of Texas' grant under the Submerged Lands Act,
extended three leagues into the Gulf.
The instruments upon which it relied in arguing
that it had an inchoate lateral boundary and that the
responsibility of the Special Master was simply to divine
that boundary is that the language, the relevant language
provides no clue whatever to how that boundary was to be
constructed.

\

31

Events ^ccurrir.n since 1845 also demonstrate the
weakness of Texas' position,

I'd like to refer the Court,

if I may, to the diagram that appears as an appendix to the
Special Master's report.
Although Texas contends that it has had, for
the last 140 years, an inchoate boundary on the Oulf of
Mexico, you will note from the map that when Texas under­
took to define that boundary by statute, it fixed a
lateral boundary which bears no relation to the lateral
boundary has existed for the last 140 years.
The median line that Texas, from the 1845 shore­
line that Texas new suggests ought to be regarded by this
Court or adopted by this Court as its lateral boundary is
marked as green line number one on the Special Master's map.
The Texas statutory line is line number three,
green line number three.
The principles

used to construct line number

three and the principles that Texas now relies upon in
constructing line number one are not the same and not
surprisingly then, the lines bear little relation to one
another.
The second link in Texas' argument in support
of its proposed boundary line, we believe, is no stronger
than the first and that is that, even if lateral boundaries
were not defined at the time of Texas' annexation or

32
subsequently, had the United States' Congress undertaken to
define the lateral boundary as of 1845, it would have used
the median line or equal distant principle and it would
have applied that principle to the 1845 coastline.
We dealt with this contention at some length
in pages 14 through 18 of our brief.

Let me only state

here that although the median line or equal distant principie is today recognized as the governing

principle in

the

fixing of lateral boundaries betv/een adjacent states, that
was not true in the 1800's.
The instances referred to by Texas at pages 25
through 28 of its brief are not instances in which the
median distance principle was used to delimit areas in
the marainal sea — with one exception and that is the
Grisbadarna case, but that case did not apply the mediam
line or equidistant principle for which Texas contends
here and which the Uni.ted States and Louisiana agree is the
proper principle.
That case said -- the Court in that case used
the right anale principle.
QUESTION:

Does the median line principle,

equidistant median line principle apply only when there is
not only a dispute betv/een two states or countries but only
when the line -- you can't, say the line has ever been
definitely established before.

Conventions to delimit -—

Let's assume, then, to get my question

straight — let's assume that when Texas came into the
Union there was a language used or at least there would be

the Gulf on and let's assume that it was absolutely clear
at that time.
MR. RUPP:

those areas.

QUESTION:

That's all right.

MR. RUPP:

The problem is that we are talking

about a controversy which has relevance only under the

35
Submerged Lands Act»
Nov/, it is the United States' position that a
decree in this Court now establishing the lateral boundaries
between Texas and Louisiana and lands obtained by the
United States under the Submerged Lands Act will finally
fix the boundaries.
We believe further, however, that the coordinates
of the line ought to be incorporated in an agreement bet­
ween the parties and presented to the Congress so that any
potential ambiguity is removed.
This is the first case that presents to this
Court under the Submerged Lands Act the question of lateral
boundaries.

Those boundaries normally, under international

law, will continue to fluctuate until fixed by agreement
and possibly by judicial decree although that, has not been
settled yet.
QUESTION:

Fluctuate depending upon what?

MR. RUPP:

It depends upon both natural changes

in the coastline as well as evulsive change?s.

Now, the -

change -QUESTION:

Now, how about man-made changes?

How about changing the location of the jetty?
MR, RUPP:

Yes, I include man-made changes.

QUESTION:

As evulsive?

MR. RUPP:

Yes.

Man-made changes are normally

36

evulsive and the Geneva Conventions specifically include
harbor works that form an integrated part of the harbor
network as part of the coastline and this Court has held
that the jetty on the east forms part of Louisiana’s coast­
line .
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RUPP:

For you to hold now, for purposes of

the lateral boundary dispute with which we are now
presented, that Texas' jurisdiction cuts the eastern jetty
and extends eastward into the Gulf of Mexico from the
natural mouth of the Sabine, we regard as wholly incon­
sistent with that prior holding.
It is clearly inconsistent with the governing
legal principles under the Geneva Convention which, this
Court has applied to cases such as this arising under the
Submerged Lands Act.
In the United States versus California, when
this Court was presented with the duty of determining the
meaning of the phrase "Inland
to the Geneva Convention.

Waters," this Court referred

This Court incorporated evulsive

man-made changes in determining the location extent of
California's inland waters.

case involving these two states in this Court, again the
Court held that man-made changes, harbor works, affected

37
the location of the boundary.

MR. RUPP:

No, that is right.

It did not.

What

the Court held in that case, of course, was that for
purposes of measuring the three-mile limit under the
Submerged Lands Act, the eastern jetty was part of
Louisiana's coastline and that Louisiana could use an arc
extending three miles from that eastern jetty.
QUESTION:

But that is really not relevant to

the dispute here, or the issue here, is it?
MR, RUPP:

It is relevant, it seems to me.

QUESTION:

Well,

is not dispositive.
MR. RUPP:

This Court has not held, as I just

indicated, has not confronted a case involving an issue of
the location

of the lateral boundary between two states.

QUESTION:

Right.

Right.

MR. RUPP:

Off shore. We believe that the logic

38

of the prior opinion leads to the result that was reached
here, recommended here by the Special Master.
QUESTION:

The baseline — namely, the baseline

is to lay out on the coast to start with — you think has
to be the same coastline that was recognised as part of the
Louisiana coastline in past cases?
MR. RUPP:

Exactly.

That is correct.

That is

the breadth of the territorial sea and the coastline to
be used for the present purposes should be the same.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Stockwell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF OLIVER P. STOCKWELL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF STATE OF LOUISIANA
MR. STOCKWELL:

I won't try to

duplicate the argument-fchht has

just been made.
clear up.

There is one thing, though, I would like to

I think it was Mr. Jtistice White, when we

argued the last Texas boundary case, asked Mr.

McDaniels

about the effect of that judgment on the offshore boundary
and Mr.

McDaniel

"That is correct.

said — and this is page 34 of our brief,
This does not affect the United States»

I do not think, because as to the United States, the threeleague limit only comes as far as our historic boundary,
and Congress has not consented for us to extend it here any
more than they have consented for us to extend it up here
north of the 32nd degree of latitude.

So, we have no

39

controversy with that."
So Mr. McDaniel was saying that in the extension
of 1848, it really didn’t affect the offshore boundary.
Now, I think ir. this case, though, one of the
salient factors that 1 see is the factor that the jetty
starts on the coast of Louisiana and extends out in the
Gulf so it is an extensior, of the coastline of Louisiana
and the Master actually determined that the jetties were a
part of the river to some extent because he said that would,
in the expert testimony, was put in, justified the fact that
you could say that was an extension of the river mouth but
he said he didn't have to hold it on fchcifc basis because
under the Geneva Convention it would be the coast of
Louisiana to the end of the jetty and they have the lewwater mark into the jetty which is about 1,800 feet or
practically what Mr. Hill said and that was the baseline,
which is the baseline for measuring the territorial sea of
the United States and under Article 12 of the Convention it
is measured from that baseline so I think the Master was
absolutely correct in taking the modern coastline — since
you had never had a boundary established — it was maybe
inchoate boundary.
But Texas never had recognized any boundary out
there.

As a matter of fact, I think the record will

demonstrate that all of these parties have treated more or

40

less down the center of the jetties as being the boundary
between Texas and Louisiana,
Now, of course, we disagree about the fact that
their median line is correct because the Special Master, in
his report, said that there wasn8t enough of the Louisiana
coastline of 1845 to justify the median line that Texas was
suggesting so we take issue on that.
*

I think one of the things that I would like to
cover before I get into that is this north — as it comes
into the Sabine River,

The Sabine River comes to the Sabine

Lake; there is no dispute over the fact that there is
three areas.
Texas in their brief admits that when they were
admitted into the Union in 1845, that their boundary was on
the westernmost branch of the Sabine so at that time there
is no question about where their boundary was.

There is no

question about the channel that was used,
Now, in 1838, which was before Texas was
admitted, the United States surveyed this land for the
purposes of issuing patents and made townships out of it
and they surveyed it to the west branch of the Sabine River
and they let Louisiana select that land under the Swamplands
Act.
Now, the only reason Louisiana could select it
was that the United States treated that as being in

41
Louisiana and then Lousiana patented that land out to
individuals who own it today and pay taxes Cameron Parish.
Now, one of the important things today as far as
Louisiana is concerned is that the same surveyor held all
of these channels were navigable so that meant that
Louisiana owned the beds of those navigable streams.
Now, what the Master has done, he admits to
these islands were rightly — were patented to Louisiana
and patented out by Louisiana but yet he says that they are
now

going to be in Texas so that means Louisiana is giving

up these navigable waters and also they are giving up these
taxes on this private property.
QUESTION:

How many miles seavrard are these

jetties from the point ■—
MR. STCCKWELL:

They are a little over three miles,

about three and a half miles, I think.
QUESTION:

And Louisiana's position was that you

then go seaward three miles from —
MR. STOCKWELL:

Yes, well, we — our first

position was, we had a statute, too, that defined our
boundary and it commenced at the head of the jetty and took
a line across the jetty and went due south and the United
States* line, this was the median line based on a line
across the jetty and after the Master decided that was the
proper line, we accept that, so we don't urge the line that

42
we were urging at the dine.
Now, so, the Master, in making this determination
about the island, about the right channels, said something
about the amount of water that came through but it is
difficult for us to see how the Master could put the land
that was already deteimined to be in Louisiana over into
Texas and that is going to be the effect of this decree.

It

is going to take title to a lot of property since it came
through the swampland grants to Louisiana and was patented
out by Louisiana over 100 years ago.
So I don't think there is anything —
QUESTION:

Well, that wouldn't affect title,

would it?
MR. STOCKWELL:

Well, I think that the only

reason that Louisiana could get the swampland was that it
had to be in Louisiana.
In other words, they vie re entitled, as you know,
to select overflow land in that border and they did that.
They made these selections and then they issued patents to
individuals.
QUESTION:

Well, but you can't go back and

invalidate those patents now.
MR. STCCKWELL:
legal question.

Well, I think that might be a

I mean, I don’t know.

Maybe there is some

prescriptive period but anyway, the Master admits these was

43
all patented into Louisiana and there is no question of
acquiescence on the part of Louisiana because right now,
they are paying taxes in Louisiana and as a matter of fact,
this same issue arose right north of there at Orange, Texas,
what they call the "Ncirrows," and they had two channels
and the Department of the Interior determined that the
westernmost channel was the channel to foe used because that
was the channel on the v?est bank of which the Texas boundary
was.
Now, that is the whole position we take, is that
the channel on which the vest bank of Texas boundary -- the
east bank of Texas boundary is the channel to be used and
the line is only moved to the middle of that channel.
Is there anything further the Court would like?
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I guess not.

Thank you.
QUESTION:

The Missouri River is full of instances

where property on the other side belongs to the state on
the other side of the river so that the fact that the
island might be Louisiana territory but yet beyond the west
side of the line isn't conclusive, I suppose.
MR, STOCKWELL:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Of

course, what we are saying is that Louisiana has title to
the beds of these

streams by virtue of th.€i fact

that the

44
United States recognized their boundary extended to this
west fork.
Now, the United States could not take that away
and give it to Texas in its 1848 act.

That same issue came

up in Mississippi versus Louisiana and the Court held that
once a state had territory, the Congress could not take it
and give it to another state.
QUESTION:

Well, was it the result of our prior

case in this Court that Louisiana's boundary went three
miles out from the jetty?
MR. STOCKWELL:

Yes, that is right.

In other

words —*
QUESTION:

And you went three miles seaward

from the end of that jetty

or from the middle of the

line between two jetties cr from the end of the jetty?
From the end of the jetty.
MR. STOCKWELL:

From the end of the jetty

because it determined that -QUESTION:

And then you started in an arc.

MR. STOCKWELL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And as between the United States and

Louisiana, that arc divided the rights to the sea bed.
MR. STOCKWELL:

That is right, under the

Submerged Lands Act.
QUESTION:

Yes, under the Submerged Lands Act.

45
Now, Texas" position in this case would mean that part of
that property within that arc would be — belong to the
State of Texas.
MR. STOCKWELL:
they say that that

That is correct.

In other words

in other words, if you adopt their

theory, they get the whole — they get both of the jetties.
Therefore, we would not be able to use the jetties to
determine our territorial seat.
QUESTION;

So if there is oil development —- if

there was drilling in the seabed within the arc that the
United States

thought belonged to Louisiana under a prior

case, it might now be determined it belonged to Texas?
MR. STOCKWELL;

Well, it might be, yes.

I mean, if it — let's say that the Court would
hold the Texas boundary extends to where they say it is, it
would put part of what Louisiana has already been awarded
into Texas and of course, one of the things, Mr. Justice,
is the fact that I think the Court started out to have some
uniformity to the coastline and to these various issues,
like bays under the convention, and what they will do here,
if this is not followed, will be creating a real anomaly
as far as this area around the jetties is concerned.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
