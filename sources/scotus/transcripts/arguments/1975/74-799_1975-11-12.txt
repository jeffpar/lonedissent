MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W© will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74-799, United States against
Foster Lumber Company.
Mr. Smivh, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is a Fedora1 income tax case hare on certiorar

to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
It involves an application of section 172 of the Internal
Revenue* Code of 1954 which permits carryback and carryover of
net operating loss deductions.
The question presented in this case is whether the
respondent can carry back a $42,000 net operating loss
incurred in 1968 as an offset against its 1966 taxable income
of $174,000 and after that offset use $35,000 of that loss a
second time against its 196? taxable income.

From the

mathematical and statutory standpoint we submit the answer
to this question is plainly "No."
QUESTION:

When you use the term ’"a second time," it.

has to be no, doesn't it?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
with that.

Exactly.
Of course, your opposition will disagree

MR, SMITH:

1 am confident they will, Mr. Justice

Blackxnun.
QUESTION:

You have presented the issue in kind of

a loaded way.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, but we think it's a way which is

supported by fch® statute»
QUESTION:

Yes, I know you do.

QUESTION:

The use the first time did not benefit

the taxpayer at all, did it?
MR. SMITH;

Did not benefit the taxpayer in the sense

it did not
QUESTION:

It didn’t give him any tax benefit

whatever.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Did not reduce his tax liability.
So whan you said it was used, you ar®

saving it just disappeared»
MR. SMITH:

It disappeared for operation of the

statute, Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Right.
We submit that no part of the $42,000

loss remains for offset against 1957 income.
stipulated are relative y straightforward.
corporation had taxable income of $174,000.
a net operating loss of $42,000.

The facts

In 1966 the taxpayer
In 1958 it incurred

In accordance with section

172 of the Cod©, the respondent carried back its $42,000 loss to

5

1966»

Onca that loss arrived back in 1966, the respondent had

to recompute his tax liability for its earlier year, in 1966,
as if that loss occurred in 1966.
Now, it had to recompute its tax liability
to the Code under two different methods.
regular method.

pursuant

One is the so-called

Section 11 provides for taxation of corporate

income in accordance with prescribed rates.

Now, once having

subtracted $42,000 from $174,000, it arrived at the recomputed
taxable income of $132,000.

The tax on that according to the

regular method was $58,000.

It then engaged in an alternative

tax computation which was provided for corporations pursuant
to section 1201(a) of the Code.

That alternative computation

is permitted for corporations which have net long-term capital
gains.

Now, its computation is set forth in our brief, the

various computations, at page 4.

The Court will see that

under th© alternative method the respondent subtracted its $42,000 loss from its $174,000 of taxable incoma and again
had recomputed taxable income of approximately $132,000.

It

then had engaged in th© two-step computation pursuant to the
alternative tax.

It subtracted its capital gain -- for short­

hand purposes wa call it its long-term capital gain — its
partial tax base was zero, or a negative amount, and then it
added to that a flat 25 percent tax on its capital gains.

The

tax under that alternative method was $41,000.
Now, pursuant to the Code, the prescribed tax is the

6

lower amount that9s applicable.
Now, this suit involves the year 1967,
^

All the

computations I described thus far were applicable to the year
1966,

The respondent filed a refund claim for that year* and

that is th® year at suit# asserting that even though its
$42,000 loss for 1968 had bean subtracted from its taxable
income of $174,000 to yield a recomputed taxable income figure
of $132,000, it claimed that $35,000 of that loss was still
available to offset its taxable income in 1967, which amounted
to about $229,000,
Now, the district court upheld th© respondent9s claim
and th© court of appeals affirmed.

In so holding, however,

the Eighth Circuit acknowledged that its decision was contrary
to the applicable Treasury regulations which were adopted
shortly after th® 1954 codification.
QUESTIONS

Has the Government5s position on tills

issue always been what it is today?
MR. SMITH:

I think so, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

It's

. my impression that th© Government’s position has uniformly
been in accordance with th© position we urge here, and I might
add also that th© commentaries shortly after the 1954 Coda

j

or in th® late fifties and early sixties prior to the Tax
Court’s Chartier decision were uniformly in support of the
Government's reading of the statute,

/

»

Now, at th® time of the Eighth Circuit’s-decision in

7
this case-,, there were two circuits which had rejected our
...
I

position.

However, they were brief per curiam affirmances.

In fact, the First Circuit in affirming and dismissing tit®
Government11 s position just characterised the position as
unimportant and seldom occurring.

Th® Eighth Circuit hare

frankly acknowledged that it was influenced by fch® cumulcitiv©
way of these two adverse circuit decisions.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITHs

Affirmances of the tax court?
One was an affirmance of the tax court

in Chartlar.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

In the Chartier case.
And the other on© is an affirmance of

the district court in California the decision of the Olympic
Foundry case.
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:
QUESTIONi

Which canto after the Chartier case?
Which came after the Chartier case.
And in which the United States district

court reliod upon -MR. SMITH s

In which the United States district court

redied upon the tax court and was affirmed per curiam by fch©
Ninth Circuit.
Now, shortly after, within about 3 months of this
decision, the Fourth Circuit issued what w© believe was a wellconsidered and comprehensiva opinion in the Mutual Assurance
Society of Virginia Corporation case in which the Government's

position was squarely upheld as conforming with the statutory
definition of taxable income.

Shortly after that the Sixth

Circuit in th® Axelrod case rejected an individual taxpayer's
si.mil.ar attempt to cumulate and pyramid the benefits of both,
the net operating loss carryback provisiors and the alternative
tax computations.
We submit a resolution of this issue depends upon a
careful analysis of the applicable statute which is section
172 of th© 1954 Code, specifically subsection (b)(2).

The

pertinent part of that statute is scat forth in our brief on
the top of page 18.

It provides

"Th® portion of such loss

which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall
be th® excess, if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum
of th® taxable incom® for each of th© prior .».years to which
such loss may b© carried.™
Wow, th® term "taxable income" in the statuta is
important.

That is a technical term which is elsewhere defined

in th© Cod©, in section 63(a), and taxable income, in accordance
with this definition, means gross income minus th© deductions
allowed by this chapter.
Now, here the taxpayer's 1966 taxable income was
undisputably $174,000.

It** 1968 loss was $42,000.

Carrying

bade th® $42,000 loss to th© $174,000 of taxable income as the
statute prescribes, in our view, demonstrates that there was
no statutory excess of a loss over taxable income which the

9

taxpayer could than us© for a succeeding year»
Nows the Eighth Circuit in this cas© in grappling
with this admittedly technical problem said, "It is impossible
to find any plain meaning in the statutory language that
would dispose of this controversy."

The court then engaged

in what we think is an erroneous groping for policy considera­
tions.

We think the statutory language is absolutely plain

and admits of no other rational interpretation.

The statute

prescribes that the loss be netted against taxable income.
Her® th© taxable incom® was $174,000, th® loss was $42,000.
Th@r© is no excess to carry forward to the year 1967.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, you*r© saying, as I understand

it, that th© majority of th© tax court was irrational in
interpreting language that at least to me seems ambiguous.
MR., SMITH:

We don't think it's ambiguous, Mr.

Justic© Powell.
QUESTION:

The tax court at least presumptively

is rational on tax matters, however wrong it may be.
MR. SMITH:

I think that's correct, and 1 h&v© as

much deference to th® tax court as perhaps anyone, but I think
in this instance they misconstrued what we think is plain
statutory language which demonstrates that our interpretation
is the correct interpretation.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

You think th® Eighth Circuit was wrong in

10
looking to the underlying purpose of the statute?
MRo SMITHs

No, I don’t think the Eighth Circuit

was wrong, but 2 think in looking to the purpose of the
statute in any statutory interpretation case, I think courts
necessarily must look for policy, but I think they vmz®. wrong
in their initial premia© that the statutory language had no
plain meaning and that it was necessary then to look to some
external purpose»

These are detailed statutes, Mr» Chief

Justice, and 1 think that they have been amended constantly
sine® 1921, and it's very difficult to discern any particular
policy because at any given time technical amendments are
introduced which author what; one might perceive to be a basic
policy.
To fch® extent that there is a statutory historical
evidence of hu* cnis decision shouiia com© out, it seems to us
that section 122(d) of the 1939 Code is instructive in the
sense that I think it's beyond doubt, as we point out in our
reply brief, that the taxpayer's position is impossible under
fch*; 1939 Code because fch® phrase upon which they relied, the
final phrase of the statute,Mto which such loss may be carried*5
didn’t exist in the 1939 Code.

When Congress amended the

net; operating loss carryback and carryover provisions in 1954
there is no indication that 172(b)(2) was meant to do anything
different than it had don© under the 1939 Code.

There were a

nmibar of changes and the committee reports discuss them at

XI
great length*

The span of years was enlarged, and a 'variety

of things were accomplished.

But this basic proposition that

in determining how much of © loss is "available" after it
proceeds back was always to be a netting of loss against
taxable income,, which in this case includes all income, both
“ordinary income85 and capital, gains.

And in this css© that

amounted to $174„000 and a $42„000 loss simply doss not
sssrviv© past that computation.
QUESTION?

Is

the loss available to the taxpayer

in 666 at all?
MS. SMITH:
QUESTION;

Is the loss available to the taxpayer in 566
I knew you apply it to his income and

the income is more so the less is all used.

But how about in

figuring his alternative tax?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

In figuring his alternative tax, as the
Do you still us© the same amount of

capital gain as h@ does?
MR. SMITH:

Of course.

I think if you look at the

computation at page 4, $42„000 is offset against the $174,000
of taxable income.

That yields a taxable income, pursuant

to section 63(a), of approximately $132,000.
Now, I think the quarrel between the parties is
to the effect that it contends that *—

MR. SMITH s
QUESTION*
MR. SMITH*

The alternative tax is figured on th©
$166,000«,
$166,000, and 25 percent of that yields

the tax figure for that year.
QUESTION:

But $166,000 of the $.173,000 is capital

gain.
MR. SMITH*

That0s right.
And you applied th® $42,000 to reduce the

QUESTIONs

I agree with you.

I just wanted to know

whether ha does or doesn't gat any benefit from this $34,000.
You say ha gets no tax benefit, period.
QUESTION'S

Mr. Smith, approaching Mr. Justice White's

point from a different angle, if you view this result in terms
of economic realities, the way it works out with me her© is
that this taxpayer's net economic gain over the 3~y®@r period
was $361,000.

What the Government is proposing to do is to

tax $396,000.
MR. SMITHS

I don't think that's true, Mr. Justice

QUESTIONS

Well, that's the reverse of the coin you

Powell.

have just conceded, and that is- that you are not giving the
taxpayer credit for $35,000 of loss.

In effect, you are

taxing Mrs.
MR. SMITH;

The reason we are not giving him credit,

so to speak, that's simply by operation of the alternative
tax computation.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITHS

Right.
Exactly.

Now, for tha taxpayer to

15
prevail, we submit, you would have to in effect merge these
two statutes, 1201(a) and 172, and we submit they ar® simply
not to be merged.
QUESTION;

Th® statutes that you ar© talking about

involve two basic tax approaches.
different from ordinary incoma.

Capital gains ar© quit®
Capital gains ar© oftan or

usually the product of accretion over periods of years, and if
capital formation in this country is to h® encouraged, that is
the purpose of th® 25 percent alternative tax, it seems to me
that the position you ar® arguing is counterproductive tc the
basic theory of a capital gains tax.
MR. SMITH?
QUESTION s
MR. SMITH:

That may be tru© as a .legislative matter.
Y©s.
But we submit that whan Congress used

th® term *taxable income” in section 172(b)(2) it very
specifically rejected th© notion of segmentation of taxable ■
income into its componant parts, which the alternative tax
computation takes into account.

Whan this $42,000 loss is

carried back, what th® taxpayer essentially is doing is
i

introducing the mechanics of th® alternative tax computation
with its segmented approach, that is its partial tax base,
plus the alternative tax plus the 25 percent flat tax computafciots into the interstices of section 172(b)(2).

And we think

that without some indication from Congress, because the statute
is replete with modifications to th© basic concept of taxable

16
incam®, and there is no modification which would admit the
segmented computation that th® taxpayer seeks to introduc©»
^feere are only two statutorily prescribed computations, on®,
the regular tax computation and, two, th® alternative tax
computation»

What th® taxpayer is trying to do is to take

its $42,000 loss .and net it against a segmented part of the
1966 taxable income,and without any statutory warrant for that
position, w@ submit that itss simply not acceptable without
soma indication by Congress that this was to b® the result.
Now, w@ think that th® statute does p©s® an
/

insurmountable obstacle t© th© taxpayer’s position and as a
result it has to construe th® statute in accordance with what
w® believe is a forced and unnatural reading»

Now, looking

back at page 18, again, of our brief, it argues that th® phrase
"to which such loss may fo@ carried” modifies the phrase
"taxable income58 as well»

That was essentially th© gist of

the tax court’s holding in Chartier Heal Estate Company, and we
submit there is no statutory basis for saying that th® loss of
$•42,000 is carried back against only th© $7,000 which represents
the partial tax base under section 1201(a)»

There is no

support in th® legislative history for that approach and,
moreover, th® term "carry” contrary to th© taxpayer’s argument
and the tax court’s position has a temporal connotation and
net insofar as a loss is carried back from on© year to another-,
from 1968 to 1966«

And there is no basis for saying that, the

17
loss is carried back to a particular type of income in 1966»
It's carried back to fete -QUESTIONS

Then if the taxpayer had had $15„000

worth of capital gains in s6S and the same loss to be carried
back* I suppose the loss carryback to reduce taxable income
would have eat©n up all of the less, it would have eaten up
all of the income.

There would have been no alternative tax

computation.
MR, SMXTHs

There would to© no alternatives tax and

the loss would have eaten up all of the income.
We submit essentially that the alternative tax is
a separate statutory system designed by Congress to benefit
the taxation of capital gain, and its mechanics cannot be
absorbed into this —
QUESTIONS

So in my example the taxpayer could not

have just carried forward the

part of the loss carryback that

wasn't eaten up by ordinary income.
MR. SMITHS

In your example, with no capital gains,

the regular computation would have b®@n used and than it would
have been $42,000 less $15,000, and there would have been a
remaining loss available.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL W. BAKER ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BAKERs
Courts

Mr. Chief Justices, and may it please the

Th@ Court by its questions has indicated that it

understands the Government8s real position in terms of the
consequences of its position.

And that is, to repeat, that

under the special circumstances of this case the net operating
loss of the taxpayer is to be wasted.

Put in numbers, this

means that that part ©f the capital gain w© received in 1966
which absorbed loss is really taxed at a 73 percent rat© in
this manner, 25 parcent for an alternative tax, 48 percent by
reason of the failure to allow us to carry it against ordinary
income of another year, disregarding surtax exemptions.

ted

today with the alternative tax rate on corporations at 30
parcant instead of the 25 percent which existed in the late

19

sixties^ that total effective rata would Im 78.
QUESTIONs

What X gather Mr. Smith was saying is

that from the statute it is clear that you are bound to have
some situations that are going to cut both ways, sometimes
the statute will be good for the taxpayer and sometimes it
will work the other way, and yet if the statute in its language
is clear, w@ ar® obliged to ignore the policy and th© objective.
MR. BAKER?

I believe that would ba correct, your

Honor, if the language is clear you are obliged.
QUESTION i

Where do you thin): fch® language is not

clear?
MR. BAKER %

First of all, and primarily, wa rely

upon the skm© analysis used by the tax court, and -that is that
fch® sentence in question is capable of being read that "to
which fch© loss may be. carried" modifies taxable income.

Her®

isi wh©r® the Eighth Circuit below agreed with th® tax court.
It said either reading of this sentence is plausible, to
use its exact words, "This phrase could modify taxable Income
or it could modify th® . earlier taxable years."

And if feher«i

war® no doubt about this, then we would have to fall back on
alternative arguments.

If the Court found that th© modifying

phrase did not modify taxable income at all, we would have had
alternative arguments, but w© chose to place our argument on
the ground used by fch® tax court, that there was an ambiguity.
The tax court

20
QUESTION?

Th® tax court has been consistent through

fch© years oh this , has it not?
MR. BAKERs

Y®sf Mr. Justice Blackman. The tax

court first rul©d in 1§69.

sine® then it has had a couple

®or© cases involving tin© same question, and as late as last
year it said, "We remain convinced of the soundness of th®
Chartier decision.”

That decision did take on? unlifc® almost

any other case we have, did take on both prangs of this
problem.

Th@ taxpayer first asked to carry bask hia loss and

tak® it against the capital gains, thus raising th® problem
Could h® take it agains*

which was raised by Mr. Justice Whit®.
th® capital gain?

Th® tax court examined th® alternative

tax provisions very clearly and. said,, it?a unmistakable, you
can’t do it.

Congress has just, said so.

So, no, th® answer is no, you cannot take it there.
The taxpayer’s alternative was, “I should like to carry th©
loss over fe© the next year sine® I could not us® it in the
capital gain y®ar.*
Th© tax court her® turned to the loss provision of
th® Cod® and found under the sentence that we w®r® discussing
that he could carry th© loss on to the next year.
tax court had both things before it.

So th©

It upheld its Weil

doctrine that it can’t reduc® the capital gain, but it allowed
the carryover to th® next year and did not therefor® require
the taxpayer to waste his net operating loss.

21
Now* th® unusual feature of th© Government5s position
in this case is that th® Government will readily concede to
this Court that a capital gain in soma of the eight possible
carry years will not affect th© matter at all.

In a few cases

like ours where the capital gain comas early in the carry
period* then \m are required under the Government’s position
\

to waste our loss.

But if the capital gain is delayed far

enough in this total 8-year period so that ordinary income
can accumulate to absorb the loss* then the taxpayer gets both
th© us® of his loss and the favorable capital gains rat®.
So it’s a matter of timing within th© carry period.
This matter — and when I say a matter of timing* I'm talking
about timing Within th© 8 possible carry years.

Tlx©

discrimination between, taxpayers within that period under
th® Government's position is based cn nc policy whatever*.

As you say, w@ can't carry a loss

QUESTION*
MR* BAKER*

Right,
Th® reason we have stressed this, as

fix© courts below did, is if th® court finds there is an
ambiguity in this language and it's not quit® clear what
Congress was doing, then it's in ©rd®r for the Court to look
to the consequences in order to s©i@ct between competing
interptetations*
Foster, to continue this line of thought for on®
moment more, must- in this ambiguous area west© its net
operating loss, but if it has a competitor across th© street
identical in ©very respect to it except on®, and that is
that its capital loss came on® year later, two years before
the net operating loss, that competitor gets the capital gain
rat©, gets to us© his net operating loss, but under the
Government9s position w@ do not.
Again, Mr. Justice Stewart, if this is commanded by

23
Congress , w© have to live with, ife*
w® have tried to assist the Court on this very
point by ineluding in our brief,at page 25 , a table which
shows the consequences of the Government’s position.

Now,

this isn't a table with assumed specific dollars in it, it’s
just a plain statement of what happens to a net operating loss
when it -encounters a capital gain in ©ach of the 8 carry y@ars,
had it states what happens under the Government’s position
and what happens under our position, and therefore w® hop®
effectively

points up the point w® are trying to make in

this regard.
W® should say something, because this is our
opportunity,to reply to the Government's reply bri©£.

Mr.

Justic® Powell mentioned a moment ago that the amount the
Government proposes to tax us on in the period is $396,000
instead of feh© $361,000.

The Government strenuously contests

this point in its reply brief.

At page 8 they say, and I

read from the Government's reply brief at. page 8,

"The

respondent, and th® amicus, further argue that th® Government’s
position would tax respondent on a total of $396,000 for the
3-year period ’66-68, although respondent's aggregate income
for th® period was $361,000.

A careful analysis of the figures

demonstrates that this statement is simply inaccurate."
Our response iss

Our statement is accurate.

Th®

Government's error is plain in this regard and is pointed up

24
by fch© statement on th© nmct page , page 9, whera th® statement
is mad©, RComputing th© tax, 63 and it9 s underlined, 68on th©
*

same $132,000 of taxable incoma but by th® alternative method
provided in section 1201 produced th® lower tax of $41,000."
As in th© exchange with Mr. Justice Whit®, I think
it was brought out clearly to the Court that the alternative
tax was on th® total $167,000 capital gain.
Th© Government in its point 1 in its reply brief
says th© statute is clear.

Of course, if the statute is

clear and th® Congress commands us to do as th® Government
indicates, we lose.

W® have felt that there are ambiguities

la t!i® statute, as demonstrated by th® opinions of th® lower
court,and that th® consequences w© pointed out are important
and should be considered by 'this Court.
The fact is teat th© Government is asking for such
an unusual out-of-tea-ordinary result her® that it has seemed
to us that they should be able to point to som® indication
by Congress that it knew it was enacting th® result which
they ask- for.

Th© fact :1s that over th® years neither

Congress has indicated teat, nor, more importantly, has th,®
Internal Revenue Service indicated

to Congress that it was

taking an administrative position that would yield such a
result as they ask for today.

And this problem has bean with

us for a long enough time for some kind of administrative
position to have been communicated to Congress on this point.

25
Yet I think there is non®.
TJ»@ Government in its reply brief and also this
morning states# "The taxpayer5 & r@su.lt would have hm®n
impossible under the 339 Code.”

Me do not agree.

We think

our result could have been possible tinder the 8 39 Cod® for
a couple of reasons, if not. more.

Certainly, the same

policy factors war® acting under the 839 Cod® as are acting
today.

Th@ Marrill case cited by the North River amicus brief

is © clear indication that the courts could have easily reached
our result under the '39 Code.
The second thing I would like to point out is the
existence of the Treasury regulation under the ’39 Cods which
says.

operating loss is available except to the extent

absorbed by the taxable income of earlier years."

Now, the

word "absorbed" surely has some overtone of usefully applied.
Congress would have bees» looking at that regulation, w© may
assume# when it enacted the 1954 Internal Revenue Cod® at
which time# as the Government3s counsel has pointed out# this
whole section was rewritten# lots more was don® to it than
merely add the phrase "to which th® loss may be carried#"
which is so emphasized.

If. would b@ entirely within th®

>

realm of possibility for that phrase to have bean added as
a matter of clarification.

Congress could have wall felt#

or whatever draftsman was acting for Congress could have wall
felt# that he was simply continuing a computational rule

26
which held theretofore existed.
Mr. Chief Justice, the respondent would ask this
Court to affirm the judgment below and in effect the views
of the tax court for the reasons presented in our brief and
here this morning.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Smithdo you have anything further?
MRo SMITH*

we submit none*
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

[Whereupon, at 10*44 a.m., the arguments in the
above-entitled matter were concluded.]
