MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1033, C. Marshall Dann, Commissioner of
Patents and Trademarks, against Thomas R. Johnston.
Mr. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SIIAPIRO, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SIIAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
Three years ago in Gottschalk against Benson, this
Court held that a method of programming

n general-purpose

digital computer to convert signals from one form of binary
number to another was not a patentable process under Section
101 of the Patent Code.
In this case, the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals has held that a computer program used to keep
records of financial accounts is patentable as a new machine
rather than as a process even though the application, in our
view, claims no new apparatus and the program is carried out
in conventional general purpose computers intentionallydesigned to handle such programming.
The case is here on a writ of certiorari under
Section 1256 of the Judicial Code.

The issues before the

Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and before this Court

4
are

whether such a program is patentable subject matter

under Section 101 of the Patent Code and whether use of
computers to keep track of financial transactions as
disclosed in the specification in this case is obvious from
the prior art.
Now, as the Denson case explains in some detail,
a general purpose digital computer operates by performing
arithmetical and logical operations on numbers.
Nov/, all of the data is reduced to

digits

represented by the symbols 1 and 0 in the binary number
system and these numbers can be made, physically to corres­
pond to on and off states of electronic signals and these
are controlled through the opening and closing of electronic
pathways within the system.

It is a sort of a system of

switching among circuits.
This switching process is accomplished through a
sequence of coded instructions that is called the program.
Now, to create a program, the problem to be
resolved has to be reduced to a series of sequences or steps
expressed in a language which the computer will accept.
In effect, therefore, every computer program
requires an algorithm, which is a precise and complete
step-by-step recipe for a computational procedure.
Because computers don't think, the algorithm has
to set out very exacting and specific rules and it has to

be expressible in a programming language.
The computer then takes the expressed language
which is usually in a higher language.

You go through

several steps from ordinary human thought to a special
computer language to language that is close to what the
machine actually uses and through a translator device, the
computer converts the language into the machine's code.
This reduces the program to the binary number
system of on and off states and then the computer can carry
out the arithmetic and logic functions by which it operates.
Now, the patent application in this case discloses
a computer program for an accounting system.

The system

permits the maintenance of individual customer accounts,
say by a bank, by assigning category codes to checks and
deposit slips that are marked in machine-readable magnetic
ink.
The categories of transactions are computed as
totals and they are reported as statements to the customer
so that he can find his rent expense for a period or his
repair expense or whathaveyou.
The specification which describes the steps in
some detail — it sets out flow diagrams for the programs
and it gives as an example as specific program a

program

for use in an IBM 1400 general purpose digital computer.
The accounting aspects are shown in the Appendix

6

at paqes 72 and 83 at least illustratively because they show
a sample check with the category

code and a transaction

journal and a summary statement.
I think the precise way into this specification,
which is long and detailed, would be to glance at page 87
of the Appendix, which states that in the system a data
processor, e.g. a store program digital computer embodying
this invention is employed.
The program may assume many different forms that
are well-known in the art.
Now, that is essentially all that this specification
y

deals with.

When you go on through it you do not find any

description of apparatus or circuitry or devices of any
kind.

What you find are the steps, the

to be carried out in the computer.

sequence of steps

So in our view, this

specification describes a system of records and procedures
for carrying out accounting in a general purpose digital
computer system.
The patent claims are very broadly worded.

The

accounting procedures can be carried out in existing
computers long in use and no new machinery is necessary.
Now, the Patent Examiner in this case rejected
the application under Section 112 on the ground that it was

ilV&ofinife© and didn't adequately disclose and under Section
102 on the ground that prior patents anticipated these

7
inventions.
The Respondent appealed to the Patent Office
Board of Appeals.
Now, the Board at this time was constrained by
decisions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals,
particularly In re Bernhart and its progeny, which hold that
each program for a general purpose computer makes the
computer into a different machine and therefore, if it is
a new program, it becomes a new machine.
The logic of this is said to be that electronically
the program sets up a different set of circuits and therefore
it is structurally different, at least for the few millionths
of a second that the program

and the circuits are in

existence in the machine.
This Court's decision in Benson had not come down
at this time when the matter was before the Board of Patent
Appeals.
Nevertheless, the Board of Patent Appeals, for the
first time in this case, held that the patent application
was not patentable subject matter within section 101 of
the Patent Code.
It said that the claims didn’t enhance the internal
functioning of the computer but were merely a process for
using it — using the computer for purposes outside the
technological arts.

8

This was an attempt to accommodate CCPA decisions
as they then stood.
It expressly held that a computer operating with
any given stored program is not a different machine simply
because somebody decides to assign to its memory a particular
human meaning

and the Board specifically found that there

was no difference between the apparatus claims which were in
this patent and the machine claims.
They really had to stand or fall together.
And then, finally, the Board held that the claims
were obvious in the light of prior art because it said that
banks have long been using magnetic ink, machine-readable
category codes and also that the system fell within the
disclosure of a portion of another patent previously issued,
the Dirks patent.
The Respondent challenged the Board of Appeals’
decision in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals on every
ground.
Now, while the appeal was pending, this Court's
decision in Benson came down and then the Respondent
abandoned his process claims, leaving only the machine
claims.
The Commissioner argued in the Court below that
Benson applied both to the machine and the patent claims and
that the computer programs were unpatentable under Section

9

101„

The Respondent argued, referring particularly to the

CCP A's earlier decisions, that a computer program is a
physical structure, that machine claims are patentable under
Benson, that Benson hasn't affected the rule at the CCPA,
that an unprogrammed general purpose computer is a different
machine, and, in effect, he said that Benson was confined
to process claims.
Well, the Court below held, again, that record­
keeping machine systems which comprise programmed general
computers, digital computers, are statutory subject matter
and that they could be patented if they were not obvious
in the light of the prior art.
Again, it reaffirmed its decision in the Bernhart
case.

It held that Benson was inapplicable because Benson

dealt with a process claim and these were drafted in the
form of machine claims.
And, of course, it rejected the holding of
obviousness from the prior art.
Judge Markey dissented, concluding that the
disclosure was obvious and then Judge Rich wrote a very
interesting dissent in which he analyzed Benson and concluded
that there is just no difference between machine claims and
structure claims in this context; that it is simply a matter
of the patent draftsman's art and that the thrust of Benson
clearly indicates that computer programs are not patentable.

QUESTION:

He doesn't think much of Benson, does

he?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, he doesn't.

lie disagrees.

He

adheres to the CCPA analysis which is that —
QUESTION:

Well, he had written the process one,

had he not, Benson?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

And he was reversed.

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

He had written Benson, yes.

He was.

Had he ever

The —
expressed how he would

have held prior to Benson on a machine claim?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I believe he joined the decision

in Be^nhart and decisions subsequent to Benson which were
decided on recox’ds completed before the Benson cate, which
continued to adhere to the CCPA’s Berhnart rule.
QUESTION:

Now, there is some talk in tie briefs

of your colleague here that there is some issue that should
not — that Government should not be allowed to bring here.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, there is an argument that the

Commissioner is barred jurisdictionally from contesting —
QUESTION:

Because he is the Board, or the

Board is — he may not challenge a Board decision.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

Now, as I take it, that relates to

whether or not this is a machine or a new machine.

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is right.

It is really whether

the Bernhart rule can be challenged in this proceedings
because o£ the way in which it carne up.

We think it clearly

can be for the reasons I recited in listing the Board of
Appeals' rejection.
The Board of Appeals, restrained by Bernhart
this time — and here is the Court to which its decisions
of the Board have to —
QUESTION:

But you are taking issue with the

decision of the Board.
MR. SHAPIRO:

In the light of what has happened

in Benson, the issue came before the CCPA.

The rejection

was under Section 101 by the Board and the issue before the
CCPA in part concerned what does Benson do to the general
doctrine of Bernhart?
The CCPA held, as it had to, one way or another.
QUESTION:

Well, was Benson after the Board's

decision in this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That

is correct.

And you think Benson bore heavily on

the issues in this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

And so you say that you should at least

have the chance to represent your arguments to the Board,
at the very least.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

At the very least, your Honor.

This Court’s jurisdiction, after all, is under
Section 1256 of the Code.

It is broad certiorari jurisdic­

tion, just as broad as if this case came up from the District
Court under Section 145 and then throucrh the Court of
Aopeals.

This issue on this section -QUESTION;

Does anyone know, have there been any

subsequent cases or other cases that know how the Board
would decide this case after Benson?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Since Benson?

I think since Benson, the Board, I

think, is takina the position that Benson is controlling,
as the Commissioner argued in this case.
QUESTION:

You mean that the Board has since taken

a position that its decision in this case is wrona?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I would have to -- well, its

decision in this case was the rejection of the application
under 101 basically.
QUESTION:

I understand, but is --

MR. SHAPIRO:
no loncrer valid.

I step in its reasoning. It is
of
That is ricrht. Recause/events which made

clear that these computer programs are not patentable.
Well, I turn to the merits, then.
If we look at the specification we can see that
what we have crot here is nothing more than an accounting
system carried out in a computer.

13

Now, as an accounting system, the disclosure is
unpatentable because a method of transacting business is an
abstract concept without a physical embodiment.

And abstract

concepts and laws of nature and mental processes are not
patentable and certainly, business methods are not patentable.
When you take a business method or an accounting
system and you embody it as a sequence of steps for use in
a general purpose computer,it is also unpatentable subject
matter.
Now, Denson clearly holds that a mathematical
formula is not patented.

It then goes on to hold that such

an abstract concept does not become patentable when it is
expressed as an algorithm fir a computer program.
QUESTION:

As a process pattern.

MR. SHAPIRO:

As a process.

Rut the thrust of

Benson is that abstract concepts like accounting systems
are also unpatentable when expressed as computer programs.
If you call it a machine you don't really change
anything, as Judge Rich pointed out.

All that is happening

when you say it is a process or a machine is that you are
taking the sarnq, sequence of steps and then saying, well, we
will call it a machine because it operates

in the computer.

It is the same way as if we called it a process.
The -- in fact, I think that since all computer
prograirts are algorithms, are a series of steps, sequences

14
of steps, none can be patentable under Benson as either
machines are processes and this is the thrust of Judge
Rich's analysis.
QUESTION:

Well, but certainly, Mr. Shapiro, that

is far beyond the holding of Benson and it seems to me that
it would require more technological ability than I possess
and I would suspect perhaps than you possess to say flatly
that nothing that might subsequently be done with a computer in the way of programming could ever be patented,
MR. SHAPIRO:

We have tried to reserve the

possibility which we have no technological foresight, as
you recognize, that there may be some sort of combination
or use of program and computer that operates in seme
synergystic way.

I can't anticipate what it is.

I am not

the inventor.
QUESTION:

No, but you probably wouldn't have

anticipated the telegraph or the telephone, either, any
more than I would have.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Which is why -- which is precisely

why, using those cases, the Court's decisions involving
those inventions, the telegraph and the telephone, have
always been limited in

such a way that the results

achieved as distinguished from the machinery themselves
can't be patented and what is happening here in this case
is that the simple idea of using a general purpose computer

15

to carry out an accounting program without being embodied
or limited to any particular apparatus is getting -- is
being patented and that is part of the objectionable aspect
of this application»
The grant of the patent, in effect, is a grant of
a monopoly on the general idea of providing individual
financial record-keeping by computer.

We think that at

most the disclosure involves new use of an old machine and
even that, I think I would have to qualify the new use but
when you claim it as a machine, you run into the long­
standing rule that you cannot get a machine patent on a new
use of that machine and that is clear in the patent law and
Congress made it doubly clear in 1952 when it added to the
Patent Code the definition of process which says that a
process is a new use of an old machine.
QUESTION:
just a

Well, didn't the Board say this wasn't

new use, it is a new machine.
MR. SHAPIRO:

machine.

The Board did not say it is a new •

It simply — in fact, it claimed to the contrary,

that there was no structural change by the nature of this
patent at all.
QUESTION:

I thought —

MR. SHAPIRO:

All they did was reject the premise

that the Examiner had relied on, which was at that -- which
was inconsistent with Bernhart.

The Board tried to accept

16

Bernhard and then come back in the back door with a way
around it.
QUESTION:

You don’t think it said it was a new

machine?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No.

But nevertheless, not patentable?

MR. SHAPIRO:

They said it was not patentable

because it found no structural change, no enhancement of
the function of the machine.

Those were its words, "enhance­

ment of the function of the machine."
So they didn't concede that this was a new machine.
Now, we get to this question of is it a new
machine or isn't it and you really have to think about what
computers are and what they do, your Honor.
The Bernhart case says that every general purpose
computer becomes a special purpose computer when you put in
a new program and the reason for this is that the electronic
circuitry changes.

But this machine only exists in fractions

of a second, while the program is going on.

And as soon as

the sequence is completed, the new machine is gone until
the program is put back in again.
Now, this evanescent electronic condition just is
not a new machine under Section 101.

The only machine

involved is the existing general purpose computer.
QUESTION:

What if you had an analog computer?

.17

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think the argument would be the

same, although we don’t have an analog computer here and
the technology is somewhat different.
QUESTION:
an instant.

I mean, there you don’t have it just for

You have it — once acquired, I take it, it is

set in place the

way any other machine is.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, with this difference.

I don’t

fully — this record has not told us enough about the
operation of what are called "general purpose analogs" and
I can't describe them for you but I think as in Benson, I
would have to say that the issue of an analog computer is
not before us here.
At least with the general purpose computer, about
which we can talk with -MR. SHAPIRO:

Is that a digital, basically, a

general purpose?
MR. SHAPIRO:

This calls for a general purpose

digital computer.
Now, these machines — digital general purpose
computers are frequently multi-programmed so that you have —
they can be operated on a time-sharing basis and almost
simultaneously they have data from all kinds of sources and
programs coming in and they are able to sort it out and
operate almost instantaneously on a large number of them.
Now, to

Sciy

that this single general purpose

18

computer is as many different machines for legal purposes
as there are programs in it is really to step into the area
of legal fiction which is what Judge Rich candidly recog­
nized we were dealing with.
The various configurations of circuitry or
electronic pathways are no more new machines than would be
switching

configurations in a railroad yard that is

constantly changing or the different circuit patterns that
appear in an electric sign that flashes the news.

You

change the circuit patterns to light up the bulb.

It is all

in it.

But it is one machine.
When we get down to, doesn't it make a difference

between process claims and machine claims, as I said, that
is a matter of the draftsman's art and finally, there is an
argument made that the general purpose computer will achieve
the same result as

the hardwire special purpose computers
(

so it must be a new machine.
But I think the answer to that is that a special
purpose machine can accomplish the same results as the
programmed general purpose device but equivalence of result
is not equivalence of means.
It is well-established that the results

that a

machine achieves, the function of the machine, to use the
old language from Corning against Burton, is not patentable
as a machine.

19

The special-purpose machine has a physical
structure.

The program is only a sequence of steps carried

out in a machine with a different structure.
Now, this is what led to the Digitronics decision
which we have described in our reply brief.
There is an argument made that the -— it would be
an unconstitutional discrimination to grant a patent on a
hardware machine but not on a programmed general purpose
machine or tahter, to put it more truthfully, on the program
itself.
I think the answer to that is that it is up to
Congress, as the Court pointed out in Benson, to decide
how far it will go.
In Deepsouth against Laitram the Court pointed out
that the scope of the Patent Clause is for Congress to
implement and that is really what takes care of the Equal
Protection argument advanced.
Now, finally, there is --- I mean, really, what
this sounds in, is the problem of technology overtaking the
existing law.

We face this in the CATV area now and the

Court's decisions have reflected that and in, recently, I
think, in the Radio Music case, Twentieth Century Music
Corporation against Aiken where the technology just doesn’t
fit the existing lav;.
Congress was called on to do something about this

20

in Benson.

It hasn't acted on computer programming yet and

we don’t know whether it will,,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON C. JACOBS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Among other things in

your own time, I wish you would address yourself for my
benefit to Chief Judge Markey's observation on obviousness,
if you will.
MR. JAC03S:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Honorable Court:
Respondent's invention is concerned with the
problem of meeting the needs of small businessmen, farmers
and professionals to have good, accurate, reliable financial
records and to have, where possible, the benefit of large-

21

scale data processing systems in the same way that large
corporations and government make use of these facilities.
One solution to that problem of providing a
computer is to do the same thing that is done in a large
corporation or the Government, to have all of the departments
or users conform to the single system, the single algorithmic
procedure, that the computer is constructed to operate on.
In short, if all of these small users, the business­
men, the professionals, the farmers, vzould all keep their
books in the same way, then that solution would have been
available.
Respondent said instead of having all of the users
adapt to the machine, let us construct a machine which will
adapt to the users.
And so he provided a set of controls for the
computer so that any ledger format, any method of book­
keeping could be used by a user and that ledger format and
bookkeeping procedure of each user would be established in
the circuits of the machine — in the

master circuits, as

we call them, in the patent application and a general set of
controls would adapt to those master circuits and their
contents and operate so that the — each individual's format
in his own way, his own words, could be operated on by the
machine.
Each individual's own method of bookkeeping could

22-3

be operated on and what is more interesting because of this
adaptive procedure, each time a user wanted to change his
procedure, change his data, change his records, he could do
it in a simple fashion.
He wouldn't need a computer programmer or anyone
else to restructure the machine.

He could communicate

directly with the machine by reason of these controls.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't the utility of this pro­

gramming be just as much available and just as useful to
the ordinary taxpayer to separate his — the checks that
went out for contributions to his church, the payments to
his doctor, to taxes, to other deductable expenses?
MR. JACOBS:

Or not.?

Yes, it would, Mr. Chief Justice and

that is contemplated by use of the program that this
machine is implemented in that precisely those benefits
would, be derived.
I spoke primarily of business users or people
engaged in some enterprise but

it was also applied to

personal financial record-keeping as well so that out of this
system would be derived the possibility that people can go
their own way and still get the benefits of the reliability
of the digital computer, the fast speed of the digital
computer to keep sound records for tax and other purposes.
And as far as these benefits are concerned, they
are ones of in effect, by an adaptive machine, removing the

24
impediment of having to deal with a machine because the
machine adapts to the user.
Now, this is not a method of bookkeeping that is
inside the machine.

It is not an accounting algorithm that

is inside the machine.,

It is a machine that adapts to any­

body's method of bookkeeping.

It adapts to any ledger for­

mat and does whatever is required in that regard.
Besides the software programming version in the
computer, in the patent application for the computer that
we described, we also indicate that the control mechanisms
can also be implemented by what is called hardware pro~
gramming.
The description is xn terms of what one skilled
in the art and in the computer art who knows the circuits
of the computer art would understand how to build and how
to operate the circuit in accordance with the statutory
requirements, Section 112.
The computer expert would know what happens in
those circuits and would know how to build a machine and
operate it and in both the hardware version and the software
version.
If we had a demonstration of this machine and
it was all inside a machine housing so we could net look in
there, there would be no question.

reasonably complex without human intervention, automatically
It is an automatic machine.

It goes beyond the

definition of machine.
QUESTION:

Oh, but you can say that about a record

player, too, but that doesn't mean you can get a patent for
a new record.
MR. JACOBS;

That is true, Mr. Justice Rahnquist.

One does not get a patent on a new record because there is
no technical innovation on the contente of the record.
are not seeking a patent on a record.

We

We are seeking a

patent on a machine and .on the structure of the machine.
QUESTION:

But the physical machine is already

well-developed, isn't it?
MR. JACOBS:

And perhaps patented separately.

The answer to your question is a

complicated one, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I'd like to give
you an answer.
This diagram is an attempt at a lawyer's
abstraction of all that we need to know of how a computer
is constructed as it relates to the issues, the legal issues
in this case.
In order to understand how a special purpose
computer is constructed, we have to understand also how the
electrical components are combined to produce that computer.
They are combined in the fashion of using

26

conventional computer elements -- correction, electrical
components — conventional electrical components, resistors,
diodes, transistors and connecting those resistors, diodes
and transistors into a circuit configuration.
The circuit configurations that we illustrate here
are the basic circuit configurations used in a computer.
They are and circuits, not circuits, or circuits.

They are

called logic circuits.
QUESTION:

May I ask you, Mr. Jacobs —

■MR. JACOBS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— is what appears on that chart

precisely the same thing as what appears on page 30 of
your brief?
MR. JACOBS:
QUESTION:

Yes, it’s —
That is because that chart is going to

be gone after this oral argument.
MR. JACOBS:

Yes.

It appears precisely on. page 30.

It is just a blow-up of what appears there.
QUESTION:

The same thing.

MR. JACOBS:

All right.

Thank you.

It permits me to point to the items

so that I can communicate with you,
QUESTION:
MR.

Thank you.

JACOBS:

Thank you,sir.

A circuit configuration is what we are asking for
in the way of a patent.

The configuration of the circuit

27

elements as defined in the brief of the Petitioner on pages
14 and 15 and on a footnote on page 15, I believe.
A configuration is the order arrangement, the
physical location and arrangement for interrelationship of
the parts.

We take circuit components and we connect them

in a configuration and that is done at the logic circuit
level.
These same logic circuits are in turn connected
at another level in a hierarchical structure of this
complex machine.

Those functional circuits, adder, compare,

branch, fetch and store, the basic circuits of a general
purpose computer, are configured by hardware programs
using as the basic elements the and,or and not logic
circuits.
At the level of the special purpose computer these

same functional circuits are combined in a new circuit
configuration and that circuit configuration is also a
program in the same way that the programs are employed to
build the functional circuits.
So to answer your question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
we are building a circuit configuration.
a circuit configuration.

The claims define

They define a circuit configuration

whether it be built by hardware or software programming.
And as I indicated, if we saw this machine
operating the question would arise from the Patent Office

28
not, is this machine patentable subject matter because it
is a machine but, how do you construct it?
programming or software programming?
is a simple question,,

With hardware

And that question

It is, how do you electrically

interconnect and interrelate the circuit elements?
That is the issue in this case.

That is the

difference between hardware programming and software
programming, a mode of connection.
The Patent Office says —
QUESTION:, Mr. Jacobs, just what is it that you
contribute to all of this?

Or is this all yours?

You talk about machine.
the IBM machine?

Are you talking about

Are you not?

MR. JACOBS:

We are talking about the IBM machine,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, what does this do co the IBM

machine?
MR. JACOBS:

The IBM machine consists of electri­

cal components, logic circuits and functional circuits and
it also consists of another device called a function
sequencer.
QUESTION:
MR. JACOBS;

What do you put in there in cddition?
What we.put in there in addition is

the software program which is the circuit configuration.
QUESTION:

And where is that on that?

29

MR. JACOBS:

Here it is the software programs which

are stored in the memory states of a computer.

Up to this

point we have what are called unrelated circuits, the
functional circuits.

If we think for a moment of an adder,

a compare circuit, a branch circuit, simple fetch and store
circuits, simple little things like that and combine them
into patterns of hundreds, thousands, even millions of such
circuits, extraordinary things take place, the computer
scientists have told us,
You can restructure those circuits by that
combination into a musical synthesizer.

You can reconstruct

it into a document or character-recognition machine, into
a talking computer, into a computer for leading electrical
meters, a computer performing calculations on the readings
that it achieves, a computer that can take us to the moon.
And all of those different things are dene with
these four little circuits.

They are not little in concept.

They are reasonably Sophisticated.

You know, they could fit

in my hand, in modern technology

so small we couldn’t

even see them — microscopically, in the most modern
technology.
But with the combination of those elementary
unrelated circuits the extraordinary technology of the
modern computer is achieved.
The configuration of those circuits is the same

30

thing that takes place at the elementary level of forming
circuit configurations which

have always been patentable

since Sam Morse.
The same thing in the way of a circuit configur­
ation that takes place at the functional circuit level
which have always been patentable since I have been
involved in this technology and that goes back some decades.
The fact that programs are used to construct
those functional circuits is no detriment to patentability.
The fact that programs are used to build special purpose
computers is no detriment to patentability.
The only issue is, how do you connect the circuits?
As my colleague indicated before lunch.
if: it is done

evanescently, if it is done in fractions

of a second, or millionths of a second, then it is not
patentable.

If it is done slowly, permanently, li.ke taking

an erector set and riveting the pieces together p€:rmanently,
that would be patentable.
But if we took a nut and bolt and put the pieces
together and then took the pieces apart with a nut and bolt,
the machine we built with that latter technique, that would
be evanescent.

It could not be patented, they say.

There is no basis in the law for this theory.
QUESTION:

But it is one thing to say that part

of the fact that you require -- rely cn a program shouldn't

31
make it unpatentable.

It is quite another to say that the

program itself is patentable, which is really what you are
saying here.
MR. JACOBS:
almost.

Almost, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

And let me clarify what the word program is.
If we look in the Encyclopedia Britannica, we

will find a definition of the word program.

Now, interest­

ingly enough it does not appear in the section under
computers — the definition doesn't.
The definition appears in the section under
automation in the section on automatic machines and in the
Encyclopedia Britannica they say a program tells us how a
machine will function,

h program tells the machine what

the parts will do and how they will work together to produce
the desired result.
The very first program that we know of took
place some hundreds of years ago in the time when the Patent
system was developed,

as the Encyclopedia reminds us and

that is a program for operating a steam engine so that a
man does not have to stand at the valves and open them and
close them as he had to do in the first steam engines.

Even

I was surprised to learn that.
What they did with the program was to replace the
human being at this tedious mental and physical labor and
build a mechanism for interconnecting the parts so that as

32
the piston went out, one thing happened with the valves.
When

the piston went in, another thing happened with the

valves.

That is a program.
A program is when we take a manual choke and

replace .it with an automatic choke.
We have programmed this simple device.
rather elementary kind of program.

It is a

It is a program never­

theless and in modern technology, where the computer is
being put under the hood of our automobiles in order to
solve the problems of pollutants and the like, the programmed
digital computer is now being used, as we explain in our
brief and as amici have explained in their briefs, to build
these mechanisms under the computer, the control mechanisms,
so that the engine will operate more effectively.

In fact,

they are — excuse me, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Let me interrupt just a minute.

In

taking your example of the change from a manual choke to an
automatic choke, presumably there is only one or at the most
a couple of patents that are available on that kind of
change but if your theory is right, there is a patent
available for every conceivable configuration of this
computer programming.
MR. JACOBS:

I would say yes and no to the first

part of your comment, your premise, but I would Sciy yes to
the last part and let me explain that.

33

There are not just a few patents to automatic
chokes.

Automatic chokes are a development that have

existed for a long time and these mechanisms are always
under examination and ways are being searched for to improve
upon them.

They still are, even in the mechanical and

electromechanical sense.
In the second part of your question, let me say
this.

Many, many computer programs are being written.

more will be written.

Many

Most of them use the state of the art,

just as most circuits that are built are state of the art.
Perhaps one percent of the circuits that are built,
that are available to us go beyond the state of the art and
are patentable subject matter.
As far as computer programs are concerned, I would
suspect it is far less than one percent, maybe a fraction
of one percent of patentable subject matter.
Not patentable subject matter, correction, are
patentable.

They would all be patentable subject matter, I

have to say, because they all configure a circuit.

They

all take electrical circuits and combine them into new
sequences and combinations and relationships and that is
patentable subject matter as a machine and the important
part for us, the important part for us, is to understand the
import of all of this and of the rule that is being requested
by the Patent Office.

34

The Patent Office says, computers built by soft­
ware programming are not patentable.
They cite a case which on the same theory holds
that since the program is supposed to be a new use of this
digital computer it does not infringe a patent built on the
hardware, on the same type of computer but with hardware
programming.
The import of that decision is that one can take
any hardware patent and infringe it with impunity —

it

would not be an unlawful infringement — by programming
a general purpose computer to perform the same set of
functions, to create the same sequence of circuits.
do
That is what that decision holds and what/ we have
as a result in the way of an absurdity?

We have as a result

that you can't get patents on software programming and any
hardware programming patent you get can be easily infringed
by software programming.
As a consequence, the patent system is rot
available as an incentive for operating in the consputer
technology.
That is the import of the rule suggested by the
Patent Office.
The Board of Appeals held that we have a new
machine.

They held it is a different machine from the

general purpose computer and they did not fee.1 constrained

35
to do the bidding of the CCPA when it comes to evaluating
this technology.,
QUESTION:

And they would hold any general purpose

computer that has a new program design for it to be a new
machine,, I suppose„

And they may not hold —

MR. JACOBS:
QUESTION:

There has been no —
They may not hold it patentable but
/

they would hold it to be a new machine.
MR. JACOBS:
of Appeals' position

There has been no change ir the Board
in this regard.

There has been one case which was published — in
fact, we submitted it to the CCPA

over opposition — but

we did submit it to che CCPA and I think it is ultimately a
part of the total record, a decision of the Board of Appeals
and that Board of Appeals did not change its position onnew machine, different machine or new use.
[Board' s]
There is not an iota of change of the Court's
position in that regard.
QUESTION:

Is the Board required to follow the

Court in other cases?
MR. JACOBS:

As a general rule it does, but we are

talking basically here about what is a factual issue?
happens inside of this box with the circuits?

What

Ano I think

the Board would fee.l a large sense of independence since one
of their prerequisites for holding office in 35 U.S.C.

36

Section 7, is that they have substantial scientific ability
and I believe they would have a considerable sense of
independence in this regard.
QUESTION:
MR., JACOBS:

Did the Board say it was a new machine?
That was their holding because the

examiner below said it was not a new machine, that it was
merely a new use and they were reversed on that — that
rejection was reversed and that is —QUESTION:
MR. JACOBS:
QUESTION:
MR. JACOBS:

And they rejected it for —
May I read —
They rejected it for some other reason.
Yes.

They said since -- they said

that there was a premise by the examiner that an unprogrammed
or a differently programmed general purpose computer is the
same machine as the one that would result from Appellant’s
programming of the same or a similar computer.
Since neither the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals nor this Board considers this premise to be valid,
each of the rejections advanced by the examiner is not
sustained.
Nov?, there was another issue,

let me speak to it

at this point, about their saying later on about "different
machine."
QUESTION:
MR. JACOBS:

Your time is short, isn't it?
It. races , Mr. Justice White.

37

They say there, simply because one chooses to
denominate a section of its memory by a term descriptive of
one meaning

such as a file of stock numbers, like in

taking inventory, rather than the file of sums of money,
that that kind of difference would not be a new machine or,
as they used the phrase, different machine.
disagreement with that.

And we have no

We are not asking for a patent

because we have applied old techniques of an adaptive
machine to a situation in which it is now going to be used
for financial record-keeping.
As to the issues of unobviousness, Mr. Chief
Justice, there is no suggestion in the Patent Office briefs
that the prior art can achieve the same result,that the
same mechanisms exist, the same combination of control
mechanisms, what we call a master and a general control and
their interrelationship as defined in the claims and as
found by the CCPA.
There is not a slightest doubt that those, mechanisms
do not exist in the prior art.
Mr. Chief Justice Markey dealt with one issue
and that is category codes.

We do not seek a patent on

category codes and I can say only that that is not in issue.
It is referred to in the claims but that provides the context
in Which this kind of machine has to function and anybody
can use any other machine to work with category codes, to

38
perform the same types of services,, the same type of use of
general purpose computers for record-keeping of users as
long as they do not build the machine that we have, which
is adaptive to the user and which has a different combination
of controls.
On the issue of jurisdiction —
QUESTION:

So if a holding company, if a conglo­

merate had lots of units around the country and it wanted to
keep track of the bookkeeping and the profits of the various
units, can it use this very machine to give it ready
information about the operations of its various units?
Would that infringe this patent?
MR. JACOBS:

Yes, it would.

If they used the

same configuration of controls, that would infringe this
patent.
But they would have no reason to.
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't say that in order to

infringe they would have to have the identical configuration.
MR. JACOBS:

The same same principles.

No, our

claims are not limited to any particular program, software
or hardware and they are not limited to the various ways
of —
QUESTION:

So yours is a generality of this way of

doing things,
MR, JACOBS:

We are claiming the generality of

39
circuit configurations whereby this set of controls is
achieved.
QUESTION:

Now, you are not just claiming something

like a copyright,
MR, JACOBS:
QUESTION:

No, we are not.
You are claiming —■ there could be a

lot of machines to do the same function but differently
hooked up that would violate your, patent.
MR. JACOBS:

That is right, Mr. Justice White.

As far as the issue of new use is concerned, let
me make one comment.

New use means you compare the current

invention with the prior machine.

If the current invention

is the same structure as claimed with the prior machine,
then it is a new use.
If it is a different s-crucuire, then you evaluate
that structure for unobviousness and we do not claim the
same structure because we have a configuration inside of
that machinb which did not exist there before and that is
the fundamental issue.
New use, when it was written .into the 1952 statute,
was for purposes of extending patentability because you
couldn’t get patents before.

The

Patent Office is

arguing here that it ought to be used to restrict
patentability, not to extend it.
A point is raised in the reply brief that I would

40
like to speak to just quickly and that is with retard to
misuse of patents.

It is a completely misleading and

erroneous statement to say that the law is such that a
staple article of commerce like a general purpose computer
could be tied in by means of a patent.
It would be clearly in violation of the Section
271 of the statute.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Shapiro'?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, your Honor, briefly.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.
MR. SHAPIRO:

First, I note that in Respondent's

analysis he has not pointed co anything in the language of
his application which expressly describes a circuit con­
figuration.

Those words don’t appear.

No drawing appears

showing any particular circuit configuration of ary kind.
What is described is a sequence of steps that
can be carried, out in a computer.
The reference has been made to a hardwire version
and the phrase "special purpose computer" used.

The

Respondent himself, in his application at A-66, drew the
distinction between a general purpose computer which is
programmed and a hardwire version but there is nothing in
this application that would tell anyone how to build a

41

hardwire version.
There has been a discussion of the meaning of the
claims.

I think if you look at the Appendix to the Petition

at page 37A, one can see the way that any claim for a
process involving a computer program can be simply revised
by a few words to be a machine claim, it is literally a
matter of substituting the word "machine" and substituting
the word "means."
But that has to be backed by some sort of structure
description in the specification and that jiist is not here.
It l.as been stated that the application is not
limited to any particular program, so that what is; claimed
is the general right to use computers for this particular
kind of accounting.
A word on the obviousness question which we have
submitted on our briefs.

Obviousness does not require the

same mechanisms to be in existence.
Obviousness is the gap between what existfs and
what someone skilled in the art could bring into existence.
The same mechanisms issue is a matter of anticipation by
prior patents and that is not before the Court.

That arises

under Section 102, the obviousness issue under Section 103.
Judge Markey, in his dissent on obviousness, was
quite specific.

He said that one skilled in the art

presented with a conventional machine system would have

42
found it obvious without knowledge of Appellant's
disclosure to have modified the system as set forth in
the. Appeal claims.
He wasn't just confining himself to category codes.
Thank you,, your Honor.
MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
