MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Mo. 75-455, Mader against Allegheny.
Mr. Robertson, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN B. ROBERTSON III
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTSON:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may ife pleas®

This case is her© on a writ of certiorari to the

United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit.
On April 28, 1972, petitioner, Ralph Nader, arrived
at National Airport to take an .Allegheny Airlines flight to
Hartford, Connecticut. When h® arrived at the boarding gate
in plenty of time for the flight, ha had a confirmed reserva­
tion , he had a proper ticket for the flight.

The agent told

him that the plane was already full and ha wasn’t going to be
able to get on.

Allegheny had overbooked this flight and it
i

i

had oversold it, and in the parlance of the airline' industry,
Mr. Nader had been bumped, just like 900 other people had been
bumped that very month by Allegheny Airlines, and 15,000 other
©opl® had been bumped during a period of three and a half
years„
QUESTION:

I suppose it’s not relevant to this case,

but the reason the airlines bump people is because a lot of
people who have mad© reservations don’t show.

They tried for

4
a while to impose a penalty for that# didn't they?
MR. ROBERTSONs
QUESTION;

Yes, they did# your Honor.

Did th® Civil Aeronautics Board —

MR. ROBERTSON;

Th© Civil Aeronautics

Board approved

and industry planned for a no-show penalty# but th© airlines
didn't like it and th© public apparently didn't like it#
although ~
QUESTION:

I suppose th® no-shows who wer© penalised

didn't like it.
MR. ROBERTSON;
QUESTION;

If th® no-shows were penalized.

I suspect if there were a no-show

penalty# your client would like that.
MR. ROBERTSON;

One of the problems with th© no-show

plan that was tried# and they have never bean able to work
it out# is that apparently a lot of the no-shows really aren't
the fault of th© passenger.

Apparently a minority of

individual passengers who simply neglect to cancel their
reservation or don't show up.

A lot of the no-shows ar®

caused by misconnecting flights# for example# traffic jams,
snd this is particularly so with the security apparatus at
th© airport now, people get hung up trying to get to th© plana.
So there are lots of mitigating factors that have mad© the
no-show penalty concept a difficult on© to work out.
QUESTION;
spoil your case.

You think non© of them mitigate enough to

5

MR. ROBERTSON:

I don91 think so.

The problem here is not that there was overbooking,
but that when Allegheny told Mr. Nader that he had a confirmed
reservation* it didn't give him the most important piece of
information of all* which was that there was a significant
risk that he might be bumped from the flight.

If ha had known

that in advance* h© could have protected himself.

He could

have arrived earlier at the eiirport than he did to improve his
chances of getting on the plcin®.

He could, have taken an

earlier flight* or he could have even taken a train to Hartford
So it's not the fact that the airlines were overbooked that's
involved here, but the fact that Allegheny concealed this
practice and concealed the fact that bumping results from it.
When fch© passenger finds out, it is simply too late for him
to do anything.

And when Mr,. Nader found out about this* thar©

was no way ha could get to Hartford in time for his commitment.
Tha speaking engagement went out the window and his hosts in
Hartford were embarrassed and discredited in their fund-raising
®fforts.

Thousands of people who war® coming out to hear

him during th® lunch hour went away disappointed.
.As a result* the petitioner filed 3uit for damages
against
action:

Allegheny and two claims were pressed in this
First* 'there was a statutory claim under the Aviation

Act. alleging discrimination in not honoring his reservation
priority.

And* secondly* and this is th® claim that’s involved

6

here, there was a tort claim of fraudulent misrepresentation
arising under the common law of the District of Columbia.
And after a trial on the merits, the district court found in
petitioner's favor on both of these claims and awarded
compensatory and punitive damages.
On appeal the D. C. Circuit issued a lengthy opinion
in which it reversed and ramendsd the judgment of the district
court.

The only issue of that decision that, is at issue here

involved its holding on the misrepresentation claim as to which
the appellate court divided two to on®.

The majority held

that common law misrepresentation claims should have been
referred for an initial determination by the Civil Aeronautics
Board, and it held that regardless of language in the Federal
Aviation Act that preserved common law remedies, the CAB must
be given an opportunity to approve conduct by an airline that
otherwise would be tortious misrepresentation.

And if it

does so, the majority held, any common law right of action
to recover damages for an injury that is caused by that conduct
would b® distinguished.
.Judge Fahy dissented on this point.

He said that

this result was not called for by the Aviation Act.

In fact,

it is contrary to that Act, and that's the issue before this
Court.
The Federal Aviation Act —
QUESTION:

Before you get into your argument, a uld

7
I just pose this question?

As I understood it, neither Judge

Fahy nor the majority actually decided whether there was a
common law cause of action,
MR. ROBERTSON:

is that correct?

That is correct, your Honor, but

tlie district court —
QUESTION:

It therefor© follows, just to get

your

request in mind, that if you should prevail the relief you
ask is that the matter be sent back to tha Court of Appeals
to decide that issue.
MR. ROBERTSON:

I believe that would b© correct,

your Honor.
The Federal Aviation Act, of coarse, is the organic
statute that sets forth in considerable detail the powers that
the Civil Aeronautic,s Board has to regulate the airline
industry.

There are two sections of this Act that are

directly involved in this case.

First, is section 411.

This

section says that if the CAB finds that the public interest
would be served, it may investigate and determine whether
airlines or ticket agents 'are engaging in deceptive
practices or unfair methods of competition.

And if so, the

CAB has cease and desist power to bring that conduct to an
end.
QUESTION:

What happened to the judgment under

Federal law?
MR. ROBERTS ON s

The judgment under Federal law was

8

remanded for additional findings, relates the details of what
happened at the boarding gates.

And we are going to go back

to the district, court in due course and try to ascertain what
those proper findings should be under the —
QUESTION:

So the ruling wasn't that you couldn't

get a judgment under Federal law.
MR, ROBERTSON:
was not that we could not.

That's right, your Honor.

The rule

In fact, the ruling said that there

was a possibility of a judgment -QUESTION:

Depending upon what the facts turned out

to be.
MR. ROBERTSON:

Hov? the facts come out, yes.

Now, section 411 does not say that the GhB can
approve any unfair methods of competition, and it does not
say that it can approve unfair or deceptive practices.

It

does not say that the Board can immunize any practices from the
common law liability.
The next, section that's relevant here is 1106 which
says as follows:

Nothing in this Act shall in any way abridge

or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by
statute, but the provisions of this net are in addition to such
remedies.

In other words, this means that provisions like

4:.l which create new remedies to deal with unfair practices
and other kinds of problems in the airline industry, those
remedies do not take away the older remedies that might exist

9

under State law.,
The decision below simply ignores section 1106.
The majority felt that the common law remedies for fraud and
deceit cannot remain totally unaffected by the Federal Aviation
Act.

But section 1106 explicitly says the provisions of the

Act are in addition to common law remedies, not that they
undercut or restrict them in any way.
QUESTION:

Would the Board have had the power to

order the airline to behave just the way it did?
MR. ROBERTSON:

I don't believe: the Board has any

such power to authorise any airline to conceal material facts
from the public or deceive any passenger.
QUESTION:

Have they got the power to authorise the

airline or order the. airline to establish a no-show policy?
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Including overbooking?

MR. ROBERTSON:

Well, the point is we are not

complaining about overbooking, now.

What we are complaining

about is that they don’t disclose to you —
QUESTION:

I und@3:stand your complaint.

I just

wondered if you felt the Board had the power to order the
airline to overbook.
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact —

It has, hasn't it?

MR. ROBERTSON:

There is a plan under which the

10

Board has approved a program that in effect is overbooking»
This is the program of Eastern Air Linas.
QUESTION:

And has the Board addressed the question

of whether that program should be announced to the public or -—
MR. ROBERTSON:

Yes, it is announced to the public.

Xt5s set forth in tariffs, your Honor.
QUESTION:

So that if anybody read th© tariff, would

you know that there might be overbooking?
MR. ROBERTSON:

-And furthermore th® Board has mad©

clear that the airline has tc disclose to the passenger when
he gets this kind of reservation he might be bumped.
QUESTION:

You mean in addition to the tariff?

MR. ROBERTSON;

In addition to the tariff, yes.

And a similar factor occurs in the liability limitation area.
The Board has made clear that it has to specifically make sure,
the passenger knows that when he checks his baggage, he is
subject to the liability limitations.

It's in th© tariff; in

addition the Board has imposed additional disclosure require­
ments, and this is true in fch® overbooking area.
QUESTION:

When he gets his compensation.if h© is

bumped, doesn’t the Board require that he be advised that the
compensation is in lieu of common law remedies which he might
otherwise have?
MR. ROBERTSON;

He must be specifically advised.

That is specifically set forth in the regulations.

11
Judge Fahy's dissent pointed out, correctly, I think,
that the concept that the Beard could ever immunize tortious
misrepresentation by an airline from the liability under
common law would really nullify section 1108.
QUESTION;

What misrepresentation was Judge Fahy

referring to?
MR. ROBERTSON;

He was referring to the same thing

we ttave been talking about and the Court of Appeals was
talking about.
QUESTION;

Failure to disclose.

MR. ROBERTSON;

Th© failure to disclose the material,

relafcioxxship between the bumping and the reservation that you
think is going to assure you transportation.
Furthermore, When th© majority below said -QUESTION;

The Court of Appeals called that non-

representation, I think, didn't it?
MR. ROBERTSON;
talking about.

Yes.

That's really what we were

It is a nonrepresentation.

So I don't have

any argument, with the Court of Appeals on that.
QUESTION;

It's a matter of nomenclature.

QUESTION;

But what you are saying in effect

permeating your whole case is th© idea that psopl© who travel
on airlines more than once or twice in thair lives don't
already know all of this as a practical matter.
MR. ROBERTSON;

Yas.

That’s absolutely right.

I

12
think if somebody were bumped tomorrow, this very proceeding
has made the situation somewhat different in terms of people's
expectations about what happens at the airline gat®»

Each of

these tort claims comes up under its own set of facts, and you
have to prove it under the common law as you find it, and they
could cross-examine the bumpee who suffered this tomorrow and
say, "Well, didn't you know that Mr. Nader had been bumped?"
QUESTION:

You mean, showing something in -the natur®

of an assumption--of-ri.sk defens®.
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, something like that.

Do you think we had to wait — I read the

papers, but I didn't know Mr. Nader had gotten bumped until 1
read the pleading in this case, or until petition for cert, I
grass, was filed.

Don’t you think most people knew about this

problem before?
MR. ROBERTSON:

1 don't know.

I don't think most

people know.
QUESTION:

But that's one thing that remains to be

tried, the assumption-of-risk idea, I suppose.
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION;

Well —

The airline could undertake to show

evidence -- I don't know how they would do it, but they might MR. ROBERTSON:

Well, they did try that and the

district court didn't find for them.
QUESTION:

A poll of passengers.

13

MR. ROBERTSON:

The district court made an affirmative

finding that Mr. Nader’s reliance was a reasonable on© hers,
that h® did expect that this was an assurance of accommodation
oa the flight.
QUESTION %

A couple years ago there was a lot of

publicity about Senator Smith, wasn’t there, from Main® was
bumped.
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

I don't recall that, your Honor.

When she was still a Senator.

MR. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

I don't recall that.

I know

a number of
QUESTION:

So it depends on who reads the newspapers.

MR. ROBERTSON:

Yes, that's right.

All I am saying

is there may be a different case and each one turns on its
own facts when you are talking about the common law.
QUESTION:

Mr. Robertson, does idia record show what

the percentage is in terms of 100 passengers or 1,000 passengers
of one being bumped?
MR. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

The percentage is about 99.94

parcent chance that you will be accommodated.

Now, of course,

that includes all the flights that aren't oversold at all
b cause there are hot*even 100 passengers for th© 100 seats.
QUESTION:

Are your chances greater of being bumped

than they are that the flight will not fly for mechanical
or some other reason?

14
MR. ROBERTSON:

1 couldn’t tell you that.

My

impression is, yes, they are.
QUESTION: Did Mr. Nader testify on the stand that if
h® had known there was a fraction of 1 percent, a matter of
probabilities that ha would be bumped, that he would not have
taken this flight?
MR. ROBERTSON:

I think, if I recollect his testimony,

he did indicate that he might have taken an earlier flight.
I can’t recall exactly, Mr. Justice —
QUESTION:

It’s probably not a fair question, but

have you ever heard of anybody who declined to fly in an
airplane because of that probability?
MR. ROBERTSON:

Oh, yes.

As a matter of fact, w©

had sorna discussion whether Mr. Nadar could be hare today for
the argument.

H© had to be in Michigan, and he had to take an

early flight because he —
QUESTION:

As I understood the opinion below, it

indicated that 4.5 people out of 10,000.
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

. Yesi.

The odds are not bad, are they?

MR. ROBERTSON*

Well, when you translate that out

to the absolute numbers, whet you are talking about is
hundreds of thousands of people every year.
QUESTIONs

I am talking about each individual.

That’s all we are talking about here.

15
MR. ROBERTSON:

That’s right.

I think the odds

mount up if you travel a considerable amount of time.
the case may be.

Whatever

This is a lot of people to be bumped, and

it's something the airlines had known about and for some
reason they haven’t wanted, tha passengers to know about it.
I think their concern is the passengers might

not like that

risk.
QUESTION:

I suppose your position is that as an

original matter,, the kind of consideration that Mr. Justice
Powell is questioning you about should be addressed by the
common law jurisdiction, that is, deciding whether or not this
was in fact deceptive.

Maybe the Court of Appeals might decide,

contrary to Judge Richey, that this was not really deceptive,
but that at any rate you want to plead or make that decision
on the basis of fraud law rather than preemption law.
MR. ROBERTSON:

That’s right, your Honor.

What this case really boils down to is the concept
that's in the Court of Appeals’ decision that the CAB might
have the power to approve a common law fraud.

This is a new

doctrine of administrative law, deception in the public interest.
And tli® whole point of section 411 is that deception is net
good for you.

411 was designed to protect people from deception

and not protect the deceivers.
QUESTION:

Youi might state that proposition in other

tnrms, I suppose, more legal, terms, that the Board might say

16
the crux» the who1® rang® of this problem» the doctrine of
assumption of risk, is written into the implied contract between
the passenger and the carrier.
MR. ROEERTSONs
your Honor.

It's not

an

implied contract,

It's a very specifically detailed contract.

QUESTION;

No, but I

change that and say hereafter.

say

that the Board might

Could the Board say, by

promulgating a rule of some kind, that passengers assume the
risk of, one, mechanical failure that cancels the flight, two,
being bumped because of overbookings and three, whatever the
other reasons might he?
MR. ROBERTSON;

Its purposes, under its statute,

under section 411» it could and it has don© precisely that.
QUESTION:

Well —

MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION;

It could say —

But to block common law suits?

MR. ROBERTSON;

I don't believe it could.

I think the best way to approach this is to look at
the situation where th© Board does have specific statutory
powers to approve conduct that might violate law.

In the anti­

trust bill, you have three different sections in which th©
CAB is specifically given power, and it's very carefully
spelled out, to approve conduct that would otherwise violate,
or might otherwise violate, the anti-trust laws.

Either

sections 408» 409, and 412 of the Federal Aviation Act.

When

17
the Board does give that kind of approval under these
sections, under these specific provisions, section 414 of this
Act specifically says that the transactions are thereby
immunized from anti-trust liability»

There is simply no

comparable language in this Act that would authorize the Board
to sanction deceit by the airlines under any circumstances
or to immunize the concealment of material facts from —
QUESTION;

Mr. Robertson, by analogy to your anti­

trust example, supposing the Board — your theory of fraud
is a nonrepresentation, failure to disclose.

Supposing the

Board issued an order saying, ”Do not disclose, because there
are conflicting interests at stake and it would be harmful to
do it/8 then what about the rationale of the Parker v. Brown
case that the airlines would have no alternative but to obey
the order and therefore it would be somewhat unfair to hold
them liable as a matter of common law.
MR. RQBERTSONs

That is just what the respondents

here are saying the Board has said, BDo not disclose, it’s
against the public interest to even disclose the truth.”
First of all# they simply haven't said anything of
the kind.

What they have said is if you retain your

common

law right, you go to court.
Now, X don't believe they would have any power
tell an airline that it may not disclose the truth.
simply beyond —■

to

That's

18
QUESTION:

Or that it must not disclose the truth.

MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

That's the question.

MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

It must not —

Yes.

And that3s hypothetical.

MR. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

This Act simply gives the

Board no such power.
QUESTION:

If it did give it such power — well, you

just answered it, that it's a different case.
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

You don’t to meet that case.

MR. ROBERTSON:

If they did, I think that would be

an entirely different case.
QUESTION:

Would your responses to these questions

conflict with, an announcement by the CAB to the public generally
that it was approving the overbooking practice, which

is

pretty close to what they have done, if they haven’t dona it.
What quarrel do you have with that, again?
MR. ROBERTSON:
QUESTION:

Well —

I am not very clear on what your position

was about that. You said they can do that all right, but. they
can't take away any common law action that you have.
MR. ROBERTSON:

What they can do is say, for the

purpose of section 411 and the other parts of its statute,
they are not going to try to get into detailed regulation

19

in this kind of axes.

What they are going to do is leave this

to free enterprise to work out, and that's what they have done
here.

But they have never said they are going to preempt

common law remedies, and I don’t think they could in this kind
of area.
Mow, suppose someone had come in and filed a tariff.
If they filed a tariff saying, reservation means that you may
b@ overbooked and you have an assumption of risk.

That would

be an entire;!./ different case.
QUESTION;

How about if they put a sign on the counter

like they have for the liability on baggage, which thanks to
a decision of mine they had to do, would that be satisfactory?
MR. ROBERTSON;

It would certainly help, your Honor.

I think you would have a lot harder time making out a common
law tort claim.
QUESTION;

Would you be satisfied with that?

MR. ROBERTSON;

Well, I don’t know what would b©

satisfactory for the airlines to do.

I mean, there are lots of

possibilities —
QUESTION;

I am talking about what would be

satisfactory to the traveling public which you represent.
MR. ROBERTSON;

I think you are a little late by the

time you get the guy to the airline counter and tell him that
they overbook these flights.
QUESTION;

What if it's on his ticket?

20

MR, ROBERTSON;

If it’s on his ticket, I think that ~

I mean, that would bs an entirely different case.

It might

be a defense to a claim that th© plaintiff had been deceived.,
QUESTION;

This would bring in perhaps something

like an assumption of risk»
MR. ROBERTSON;
QUESTION;

Yes.

In other words, "You are hereby notified;

that you might be bumped, and if you ar© bumped, there will be
no liability on the part of the carrier."
MR. ROBERTSON;
bit of concealment.

But that doesn't involve the slightest

I mean, they are telling you here.

They

ar® telling you, and you can assume that risk safely, it seems
to me, and mate your own judgment.
As I say that's the genius of this Eastern Air lines
system in which they do tell you that, "Look, you ar® in a
class of people that might get bumped her®, and if you don't
like it, take another flight or go on another airline, and if
you do get bumped, you might the denied-boarding compensation
penalty.
QUESTION;

Mr. Robertson, did I understand you to

say that mere inclusion in the tariff would be sufficient, in
your opinion.
MR. ROBERTSON;
case.

It would be an entirely different

I don't know how it would com© out.

As a practical

matter, people don't, read the tariffs, but they are held to be

21
binding as a matter of law.

You are deemed to have notice

of everything that's in the tariff, and the cases have
consistently held this.

I think it would be a very different

case than the on© we have here.
So the decision below would turn the Act on its head
411 says that th© CAE can eliminato deceptive practices.
Th© Court of Appeals says that it can approve deception in the
public interest.

1106 says that the common law remedies

survive and that new statutory powers her© are in addition to
these remedies.

The Court of Appeals says that the common

law must b© altered and these remedies are subordinated to
administrative powers that aren't even stated in the Act.
I think that this decision calls for a major reallocation of
functions between th® common law courts and th© Federal agency
This would seriously disrupt th© statutory scheme , and as
Judge Fahy said, it's plainly contrary to th© intent of
Congress.
. So w® respectfully urge you to reverse the decision
below.

OHM, ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PRETTYMAN:
th© Court:

>Ir. Chisf Justice, and may it pisast

This case presents only on® single and very narrow

question, and that is whether the CAB does have power to

22
regulate in the area of notice to the public of overbooking
by regulated carriers.
Now, we have to start with overbooking itself, even
though it's not directly involved her®.

In the first place,

petitioner concedes that overbooking itself is not illegal
per se, and in the second place, the overbooking part of the
case, if you will, has b@©n remanded back and ifc9s not before

Well, the CAB has approved precisely that

kind of a tariff in that Eastern Air Lines plan.

the privilege of not showing up and not being penalized for it.
I suppose that's the other side of that coin, isn't it?

24
MR. PRETTYMAH:

Well, I think there is the other

side of the coin,, but I would suggest to you that these are
precisely the kinds of questions that the CAB has now been
struggling with for 20 years , because this goes back to 1956
when they first took a look at this whole problem, and sine®
then, as I am going to detail for you, they have dealt with it
at some length and in some depth and they have reached a
number of conclusions which I think you ought to know about
because what you are going to do if you hold for him is you
ar® going to take this whole problem away from the CAB that
has been attempting to deal with it now for 20 years and has
detailed regulations on the subject, has detailed regulations
on the subject, and you are going to say, now we are going to
allow $25,000 awards which in effect is going to not only
bring a stop to overbooking, which the CAB has said definitely
is in the public interest -QUESTION:

I am not sure I

.understand that.

You

assert the CAB has power to regulate this practice and to
insulate the airlines from these sort of actions.

I take it

you think it does.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

We say that the CAB has power to

regulate both in fcha area of overbooking and in th© area of
notice to the public.
QUESTION:

And you think enough has happened so that

these kinds of actions may not be maintained.

25
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION;

Oh, absolutely.

All right, now, suppose — if all a court

did was to say, well, the GAB might b® able to do that, but it
hasn’t done it yet, you certainly haven’t driven any hole
through the Civil Aeronautics Board or the Civil Aeronautics
Act.
MR. PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Justice, we say two things.

The CAB, if it turns around that sort of

an approach, the CAB could turn around tomorrow and make it
clear, if it had the power to do it, as you say it does, that
the airlines must do this and that we are preempting these.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That’s what the Court of Appeals was

saying here, is that this is a matter which should first be
sent to the CAB to determine, first of all, whether they have
already ruled on it, as we think they have, and, secondly, if
they haven’t ruled on it, to get the benefit of their judgment
before the courts try to decide in the first instance whether
this amounts to fraudulent misrepresentation.
QUESTION;

Let’s not read section 1106 right out of

this lawsuit.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Sir, section 1106 is precisely the

language that went way back to 1906 in the Texas & Pacific
Railway case.
QUESTION;

Wherever it cam© from, and it may be

boilerplate, but it does say something, and it must be listened

QUESTION:

That’s quite a different case.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, no ~

Apparently it was a different case.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

It isn't a different case, your Honor.

Let me make this very clear to you.

Back in 1967 the CAB issued

detailed regulations dealing with overbooking and with denied
boarding and compensation, and they decided that because of the
extraordinary no-show problem which amounts to almost 10 percent
of your sales — I think you have got to get a picture of what
goes on hare at these airports.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

say.

Sir, only a very small part of it, we

And the figures here are in conflict.

The hearing

27
examiner decided it was somewhere between 50 and 60 percent,
he couldn’t decide who was the major contributor to no-shows.
But certainly a great number of no-shows, I would say at least
in the area we have, are simply people who make reservations
and who do not turn up.
Now, that problem was costing the airlines industry
over $18 million a year and the Board, being extremely concerned
with this, decided that they would issue detailed regulations
and allow overbooking to take place, and if there was an over­
sale, to allow a specific amount

for denied boarding compensa­

tion .
All right.

The next thing that came along was this

problem of notice, and I will be very frank with you, their
first reaction to it was the same as Mr. Nader’s.

Their first

reaction was, well, it's kind of deceptive not to tell the
public, and consequently, we will have — their first suggestion
was 24 hours notice before flight time, and then tha second
suggestion, and this they were actually going to make a rule,
they issued a notice of proposed rule-making, that you had to
give 12 hours notice if you overbook to the passengers on the
plane.

What happened?
QUESTION:

a minute.

The airlines came in and they showed —-

Mr. Pretfcyman, let ms interrupt you just

You are saying that this is just what Mr. Nader

is asking for.

If I understand it, what the CAB was talking

about there was notification of individual passengers who had

28
reservations within the 12-hour or 24-hour period, and what
Mr. Nader's argument is that the airlines either by implication
representing that there is no problem to the general public
I think those

that a confirmed reservation means just that.
two could stand consistently with one another.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, I wou3.d respectfully disagree,

your Honor, because I think that what he is saying is that when
he called to make a reservation, they failed to give him notice
that they might not get on the flight because of an overbooking
situation.

/

You have got to understand this overbooking.

This

isn't designed to create oversales; if the thing works perfectly,
there is no oversale.

For example, just take this very flight.

This very flight had a history of leaving with an average of
six empty seats on every flight.

So what they were doing was

overbooking in an attempt tc compensate for those empty seats.
They had only had one prior incidence of overbooking on this
particular flight.

So you shouldn't get the impression that

this thing is just a sloppy method; it is don© through, a
computer in an attempt to make every flight leave with every
seat taken.

And that's why the CAB,very concerned about over­

sales, said in effect that we are going to approve an overbooking
so long as you have three conditions, they are very important;
First of all, you have to get denied boarding compensation has
to be handed to th® man if there is an oversale, right or, the

29
spot.

Secondly, you have to have priority rules so that your

far®

oversales, if you have more than one, that they are

treated in a proper manner.

And, finally, you have to file with

us wuarterly and monthly detailed reports with the CAB of your
oversales.

They get monthly reports about this.

QUESTION s

How about overbooking?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Sir?

How about

MR. PRETTYMAN:

do they •—

Overbooking is meaningless until it

runs to an oversale, your Honor.
QUESTION:
doesn't

I know, but don’t 'they tell how —

an airline tell the Board it as an airline is calculating

its overbookings?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

No, it doesn't.

Some airline might be reasonable about it

and others might not.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Th© statistics show whether they are

being reasonable, because if they ar© overbooking -QUESTION:

How can the CAB know they are being

reasonable unless the airline tells them?
MR. PRETTYMAN%

Year Honor, because if they have too

many oversales, it’s an obvious indication that th© overbooking
is not working.

In other words, by the reports they get every

month of oversales, they can tell whether an airline is out
of kilter in terms of its overbooking, because if it has too

30

many oversales, obviously the system is not working right.
We, for example, Allegheny, are below the average —
QUESTIONS

You report ©very month the fellows who are,

left at th® gate.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
detail 'than that.

Yes, sir.

Absolutely.

And more

It5s in th® record as to precisely what the

reports are.
Now, I want to get back to this notice thing again
because I think it’s extremely important.

When it was

suggested that the public be told about the overbooking situation
and that they might not get on the flight ~
QUESTION:

When you say the public, you mean a general

message or notification of people with reservations?
MR. PFETTYMAN:

I think that the notice would be of

the kind that h© seeks here, and -that is when you call up they
qualify your confirmation.

In other words, they say, All right,

we are going to put you on this plane, but you should be awar®
of the fact that you might not get on it.
Now, listen to what th© Board said when it rejected
a rule specifically designed to do that.

It said, this is the

Board’s words, not what th© airlines argue to them, it said,
"The resultant confusion, alarm, bitterness, and cancellation
of reservations."

It referred to the very sizable number of

people needlessly alarmed by th© notification of their overbooked
status.

They referred to reservations that would have been

31
cancelled on flights which actually could have accommodated
the passengers.

They talked about th® large number of passengers

who would be denied reservations on flights which because of
reservation turnover and no-shows would depart with empty seats .
What are they saying hers?

They are saying that here

in an effort to make up for the problem of no-shows, they are
going to allow you to overbook, than if you are going tx> give
notice, you are going to exacerbate the very problem that we
are faced with in the first place, because you are going to
have people making multiple reservations and a lot of people
not showing up, and instead of six empty seats on Allegheny
Flight 864, you are going to have 15 or 30 seat3 if you start
telling the public this.
Now, the point I want to make to you is this —*
QUESTION;

They didn't tell them not to tell th®

public and they didns't tell them to overbook.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Sir, what they did was, if you look

at part 250 in th© regulations, they had a detailed plan for
what happens when you overbook and have an oversale —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but they didn't'. ~~

MR.PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION:

And the second thing you have —

No airlines is in violation of an order of

th© CAB if it does not overtook.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

You mean if it says that it's over­

32
QUESTION;

No.

MR. PEETTYMAN;

If it: just does not overbook.
That5s absolutely correct.

That's

absolutely correct.
QUESTION;

No airline is in violation of any CAB

order if it overbooks and tells people it is.
MR. PEETTYMAN;

It may go out of business, but it's

not in violation of any CAB order, that's correct.
QUESTION:

So th© CAB left the airlines on their own

in this respect, didn't they?
MR. PEETTYMAN:

Sure.

I'll tell you this.

I think

that if tomorrow an airline began telling th© public that they
might not get on these flights,, there is a serious question
whether the CAB —
QUESTION:

They don’t have to tell them.

It’s just

that your opposition's position is that you may have to pay a
judgment now and then.
MR. PEETTYMAN;

Well, th© point I am trying to mak© is

that you and I may argue about th© wisdom of both overbooking
and denied; boarding compensation and notice, but th© real point
is that we shouldn't be here arguing this, we shouldn’t have
4.0 pages of brief and talk back and forth about whether this is
wise or not.

This is what th© CAB is for.

This is precisely

what it is designed to do, to take into consideration the pros
and the cons of notice.

There are things to be said against

notice, there ar® things to be said in favor of it.

But this is

33

precisely what this agency is designed to do* is to take the
public interest* not Mr. Nader's particular problem, which of
course is serious to us, but to tak© th© entire public interest
problem into consideration and say,

Now, wait a minute.

were going to issue this rule requiring notice.

We

We find, as I

have read h©re to you
QUESTION;

May I just interrupt.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION;

Certainly.

Your whole argument proceeds on the premiss,

as I understand it, that overbooking really is at stake in
this case.

Is it not entirely possible that w© could reverse

and send the case back to trie Court of Appeals and they would
find there is no common lav; fraud by reason, of the failure to
disclose?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

They might find that there is no --

You haven't conceded that -there is common

law fraud?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

No, I have not conceded there is a

common law fraud.
QUESTION:

Is it not correct that it is not necessarily

true that the kind of notice you ar© describing is at issue
but merely you would have an obligation to give sufficiant
notice to have a defense to a common lav; fraud action?

In other

words, if you had on every ticket, you have on© chance out of
10,000 if you don't get there 15 minutes early that you may be

34
bumped, something like that.

That would probably be ar

adequate defense, even though it wouldn't be the kind c>f notice
that you are saying he wants.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Th® difficulty, your Honor, is that

the primary jurisdiction problem .enters th© case before, that.
In other words, where it should enter the case is when —
QUESTION;

But does it enter it with respect to th©

question that we have to decide which was presented by the
certiorari?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

It. certainly enters it in connection

with notice, that's right.

He is claiming that he did not

receive notice
QUESTION:

I knew what he is claiming, but you

certainly aren't admitting that that's the only kind of notice
that would b@ an adequate defense to a common law fraud, case,
are you?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

No, that's true.

But the point I do want to make is that when the
case first comes up and it is first prc@sent.ed in the di.strict
court .is at the point where this Court, it seems to me, has
said in innumerable cases, cases like Ricci, for example, not
just that you have to go to the CAB

because they have some kind

of exclusive jurisdiction over this, even.

We think they do.

But even to get their view about this is helpful for us in
deciding this kind of case.

35
QUESTION:

Mr. Pretfcyman, what about the CAB, assuming

it has some authority to regulat® safety conditions on airplanes,
does that mean that ~
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

The FAA.

OK, the FAA.

Does that mean that before

a passenger can sue an airlin© as a result of an aviation
disaster, he has to first present his claim to the CAB?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

No.

But that is more like our

priority problem here, which is a different problem.

Now, th©

Court of Appeals has said that if you have your priorities on
file and if you violated your priorities, then that is a court
Question, and there have been a number of recoveries because
priorities are set out clearly and there is nothing for th® CAB
I

to do, assuming that the priorities that you have are fair.
And if you have violated your priorities, then you can recover
in court, just as h® may b© able to recover on th© remand of the
other section of th© case, because, you know, we obviously claim
w© filed our priorities, but if we are wrong -QUESTION:

Th© Federal law claim.

But I am asking

you whether in order to make a State lav/ claim for negligence
against an airline as a result of a disaster, you have to first
go to the CAB and s@@. if they approve it.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Wall, you do if the question that is

involved is whether a particular safety regulation, for example,
was in effect or was violated or an issue as to a regulation

36

relating to safety.

As soon as that becomes involved, the

whole case doesn’t go to the CAB, or in that case the FM, but
that section interpreting the safety regulation is then
shifted to the PAA for determination, for its interpretation of
that safety regulation.
QUESTION:

Is that wail established in casesV

I

hadn’t realized that.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Sure.

That’s what the whole line of

primary jurisdiction cases that you’ve established says, and
that is in any on© of these cases where you get into an
interpretation of a board or agency’s regulations or rules that,
instead of the court deciding, it should b® sent to the agency,
if the agency has not heretofore decided the question.
QUESTION:

Are there any primary jurisdiction cases

involving negligence claims?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I am not familiar with them either.

Oh, yes, sir —•
QUESTION:

A lot of anti-trust cases, I know.

MR. PRETTYMANs
cases, your Honor.

Let

Yes.

There are a couple of exculpatory

m@ just give you an example of the

type of case that have been referred to agencies or thrown out.
The Lighten case.

It’s in cur brief, L-i-c-h-t-e-n, is the

one that seems most obvious where there was a common law
claim and whe&e in fact there was nothing specific giving the
Board jurisdiction, and yet in which ~~ that was a case

37
involving jewelry on a plan© that was delivered to the wrong
person, and the court ruled that the CAB tariff controlled and
that the passengers assumed the risk unless the carrier was
specifically notified of the jewelry.

Now, otherwise/ that

would have been a clear case of a common law recovery and there
was nothing specific that gave the CAB jurisdiction in that
case, and yet they said that that was a matter which did com©
under the CAB.
QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyman, the claim under Federal

law , under the Federal statute is sustained eventually.

Federal law would not protect this kind of action from a State

the

It said first of all that,

overbooking was not per s© illegal, and secondly/ therefor®,

38
the only question that was properly up was whether the priority
rules had in fact been followed.

And there was a dispute about

that and therefore it was sent back for a determination of that
single question.

So that's why the Court of Appeals decided

fch® way it did on the Federal cans® of action.

I mean, you are

asking m© to assume a result which I would say would be wrong
under my theory, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe.

It seems to me that it's

an awfully difficult thing to claim that you are protected from
a State cause of action because of a Federal law that you
violated.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, but that would be a

That would be a claim of unjust discrimina­

tion and so forth under 404.

That would be that there was

QUESTION

%

In the anti-trust area sometimes an

agency has the power to insulate you from the anti-trust
section as long as you do tilings the right way.

If you do

them the wrong way, you can get sued under the anti-trust laws.

39
MR. PKETTYMANi

But til© priorities have absolutely

nothing to do with fch© notice issue that's in front of the
Court now, your Honor.

It has nothing to do with it at all.

Priorities has to do with whether, if you have more than on©
oversale, how you are going to treat them.

The issue bafore

this Court is whether, sine© he claims that he was entitled to
notice and the CAB has bean working with this issue and dealing
with it and deciding not to tell carriers to give notice, in
fact, absolutely doing away with th© proposed rule that would
have required us to, whether you do not turn to the CAB in th©
first instance and say, number on©, have you decided in the
past and already, back in 567, that not giving notice is proper?
Or if you have never decided this question, give us your best
advice now as to how you would decide prospectively, because
that would aid us in tinis case.

That’s precisely the line of

cases that you have had here in so many instances.

This is

precisely the kind of question that is referred to the Board for
its expertis® and in order to avoid conflict.
Hew, may I just present to you —
QUESTIONz

Mr. Prettyman, let’s assume that what the

Court of Appeals did here was correct and that this now goes
to th© CAB and th® CAB says, "Ho, we never decided this in th©
past, but now that you ask us, we think we will probably decide
in feha future and we can tell you now that w® will hold that
not giving notice is all right."

Then would it be your submission

40

that that ends this claim, that that's an absolute defease?
ME. PRETTYMAN:

I would take tills position, your Honor,

that if they say that not because of all th© considerations,
the balancing considerations, that notice should not be given,
that that should strongly influence the court in deciding that
in fact, there was no fraudulent misrepresentation back in 1972»
QUESTION:

Should it be determinative?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

I would personally think it would

b© determinative, but I concede that the court would have some
role to play because it might decide that simply because of
what the Board is deciding now, it doesn't necessarily preclude
it back .several years ago.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Of course, I would take a position

41
QUESTIONI!

Right.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

But let me make on© point vary

strongly her®, because I am not sure that I1v© gotten this
across, and that is that you cannot have a $25,000 recovery in
this case and the CAB operating in th© area that it thinks it’s
operating in, as it told th© Court of Appeals it think it's
operating in, both going on at th© same time.

The CAB has an

investigation right now,and has had since 1973, into this whole
problem.

It has an ongoing investigation.

Did they also say that this is what we

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION;

No.

No.

What they did was --

They said they want to maybe have a new

swing at it.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

No.

They detailed everything that had

gone on and this extraordinary number of orders and backing
and filling on this entire problem, and the regulations that
they have and hew they worked the denied boarding compensation
out, and the notice —■
QUESTION;

Did their brief address both the common law

issue and the statutory issue?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Both.

Yes, sir.

And they said they

QUESTION:

Is their brief in fch® record, I wonder?

MR. PRETTYMAN;

It can easily b© supplied to this

Court.
QUESTION;

Did. they explain what they meant about

saying that you could keep your common law remedies if you
didn't take the denied boarding compensation?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Yes.

You see, what that means, your

Honor, is that there are- two types of cases ‘that are kind of

43

On® is the Ella Fitzgerald type case where an

airline denied boarding to a passenger solely on the basis of

discrimination case.

That is a racial

You go into court and you can recover.

Therefor©, there is no primary jurisdiction in that kind of
case.
Another kind of case would b@ the

priorities? case.

That is, if you have violated your priorities, there is nothing
to go to the CAB about.

Therefor®, you can choose to turn

down your denied boarding compensation and go in and got
higher damages than you would get under denied boarding
compensation, because they have violated their priority.

It:s

those kinds of things that are still left over, and that's the
reason, why soma passengers turn down their denied boarding
compensation.

There is a recent cas© before Judge Gesell,

for example, where a paraplegic was denied entrance to an
airplane because he didn't have somebody with him, and the CAB
has not dealt in any way with that problem, and therefor© that
presumably would not have to go to the CAB.
But the point I have to drive home —
QUESTION:

Did the CAB indicate what should happen

to this case?
MR. PRETTYMANs

have primary jurisdiction.

Yes.

It thought

that it should

QUESTION:

To do what?

MR. PRETTYMANs

To decide what the correct practices

should be.
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but does it indicate that

furthermore if we decide that th® correct practice should be
no notice, that therefore there is no cause of action in this
case?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
far.

Well, your Honor, I can't go that

My memory doesn't serve me

best

to tell you whether they

went that far, but what they did say was that they were heavily
involved in this entire problem, there were ongoing investiga­
tions, that they should have a hand, at least, in giving th©
court th® best advice that they could about what the practices
should be.
But, again, if I can just say one word, and that is
I want to emphasis© it so you know what you do her® when you
allow a $25,000 award, you are not only allowing that, but you
ar® eliminating overbooking.

Th® CAB has said so.

You are

eliminating overbooking, and 1 think that you are placing
yourself, with all du® respect •—
QUESTION:

Th® $25,000 as an independant punitive

damages recovery is still another hurdle that they have to
get over.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

You are not conceding th@y ar© entitled

45
to punitiv® damages —
MR. PRETTYMANs

No, no, no.

But what I am saying

is if you allow them the optiln of trying for punitiv© damages
and getting this kind of award, you are doing away with over­
booking, and, as I say

with great respect, you are putting

yourselves, I think, in the shoes of fch© CAB, because that is
a CAB decision and not your decision.
QUESTION:

One more question, Mr. Prettyman.

Your

friend responded — I won't call it a concession — but he
responded certainly not negatively that if the ticket, airline
ticket on the back said something to th© effect that there is
one chance in a hundred or maybe two chances in a hundred if
they wanted to be safe that you will not b© accommodated as a
passenger on th© flight covered by this ticket either because
of mechanical failure, bad weather or overbooking.
Now, it can't b© that simple

that that would solve

this problem, or I should think it would hav© been don©.

What's

the flaw in that?
MR, PRETTYMAN:

Well, I think the answer is it

certainly would do away with any claim of fraudulent misrepresent©tion, but I think th© problem from fch© airline industry's
standpoint is that right now there is a tremendous amount of
multiple booking going on.

Pdople make reservations on any

number of flights, and they only take one, if they take any.
QUESTION;

Did anyone ask th® plaintiff in this case

46
whether h© had ever done that?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

You may be assuming that most people read

I have been traveling on airlines since they

I have never read a ticket yet.

I don’t know what's on

Your fears may b© ungrounded.
Well.

Very well.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Of course# the point I think you ar©

trying to mak© is if you really gave people notice.

I mean#

if you are just going to give them a formal notice to get away
from your fraudulent misrepresentation claim# that's on® thing#
but if you ar© going to put up a big sign and say# wa don't
really confirm this space because you may not get on the plan®#
if you don’t think that is going to have an impact in terms of

And that’s what the

CAB is saying and that’s what they are fighting with.

It’s

not an easy problem they have got.
QUESTION:

Mr. Prsttyman, could you conveniently

47
arrange to have the members of fch® Court supplied with the
copies of fch© brief filed by the CAB in the Court of Appeals?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Absolutely.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1 certainly will.
Do you have anything

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN B. ROBERTSON III
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, ROBERTSON:

Just on® brief clarification, your

Honor,
On the 1967 proposal, I think it’s important to poinfc
out, I have submitted to the Court a set of th© relevant CAB

materials for your convenience, lodged with the clerk.
QUESTION:

A set.

MR. ROBERTSON:

Do you mean on® or -~

Ten sets, lodged with fch© clerk, so

that if you want to look at these documents that are sometimes
hard to find, this was fch© rule-making cod© EDR-95, and that
did contemplate a general warning to b© given to all passengers.
What it was talking about was that the airlines would have to
figure out 12 hours ahead of time every flight that was likely
to b© overbooked, that was overbooked at that time, and it would
have to call up every passenger, sometimes long distance, to
warn them that they might be bumped.
they simply couldn't do that.

And fch© airlines said

They didn't have the data

processing capacity, they didn't have th® personnel.
involve millions of calls every year.

It would

It would b@ enormously

48
costly.
The GAB had noted that every airline said it
recognized on their own the obligation to give a warning, and
til® purpose in this rule-making is simply to regularise! those
procedures.

The CAB finally concluded that it didn't reed to

regularize those procedures at the cost of such flaseibi lity.
That's EDR-95, page 4.

So I don't think we are talking” about

the same kind of thing her®.
QUESTION %

Mr. Robertson, do you know why the CAB

isn't here?
MR. ROBERTSON:
deal, your Honor.

I have wondered about that a great

I can't draw any conclusion on® way or the

other.
QUESTION:

Did the court ask them to participate in

the Court of Appeals or did they come in by themselves?
MR. ROBERTSOH:

They said at the Court of Appeals

level that the ease was so important that they should be
permitted to file a brief five months after all of the briefs

were due, I must say, over my objection.

But then they

I assume they feel that

I can adequately represent their interests.
