ORAL ARGUMENT OF NIKI Z. SCHWARTZ
-

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR, SCHWARTZs

Thank you, your Honor,

4

Mr, Chief Justice,'and may it please the Courts
Tfe® issue in this ’oese is whether or not eight men, eight
truck drivers, discharged for dishonesty, of which they were
innocent, shall bo permanently deprived of their jobs, their
livelihoods, and their good names because they ware afforded
tii® fom without the substance? of a grievance proceeding.
That issue arises on these factss

On - •»■»»**.* ’■*.. 196?, 1? Anchor Motor Freight truck
drivers were discharged for alleged dishonesty in allegedly
turning in inflated motel receipts for reimbursement.

In

other words, the 3receipts were for more than they actually
paid.,

On that day the company showed its evidence to the

business agents- for Teamster Local Union No. 377.

That

.j'vidmce, which is in fchs record and in the Appendi:?, eonsisi jd
of the motel registration card and the correlative motel
receipts, the registration cards showing less paid than the
amount showed on the receipt.

In addition, the company

4
presented the affidavits of fch© owner of the motel and the
clerk of the motel attesting to these records and fco the
fact that the man had h®@n given receipts for mor© than they
actually paid.

In addition# there was soma corroborative

things in fch® form ©f logs and sign-in sheets.
The mian did not dispute that they had been in
Batavia where their logs showed they were.

They did not

dispute -that they had stayed at that motel.

But they

vigorously denied fco their union leadership that they had paid
any lees than the receipt thay turned in.
After a meeting between union and company officials
it was agreed between them that the matter would be referred
to fch® Joint Conference Grievance Committee in Detroit Q -that
4

the men would continue, working pending a decision on that.
Th© men war© really aghast at what had happened to
them# went to their union leadership# the two business agents#
\

Angelo and Schwarts# and said#
go up thcgra?

What ©hall we 'do# shall w©

Should you or w@ or somebody go up there to

the motel and talk fco fch© clerk or fch© owner?
a lawyer?

Should we do this?

Should w@ get

Should' we do that?

They were advised# No# don't do anything# don’t
worry about it# they can't, fire you# you are a sure winner#
you have nothing to worry about# don't do anything.
fcak© car© of it.

We will

And that’s clear in th® record.

So the men heeded 'that advice as “advice of knowing

5
what

going on,” truck driver lingo# I think.

And they

didn't do anything# relying on th® union to do something.
well# the union didn't do anything at all# ©xc©pt
go to -th© Grievance Committee and assert by raw assertion this
men didn't do it# it must have been th® motel clerk.

Ho

evidence to support that argument# just raw argument.

Th® soon,

the majority of who® went to th© Grievance Committee# war©
given th© opportunity to state their contention -that they
didn't do it.

Th© company presented all of its evidence# not

insubstantial# and the grievance was upheld.

Th® men w®i:®

astounded# having been assured that everything would foe all
right# and they went to th©ir union leadership and said#
What do w® do now?

Should w© get a lawyer?

They said# You might as well.
S© they want and they got a lawyer# finally.

Th©

lawyer went to Batavia and hm got © statement# a notarised
interrogation statement# from the motel owner which said that
th© mot©! cwn@r had no personal knowledge whatsoever of the
mount actually paid and written down# that his affidavit had
been based entirely oia the records themselves

and th® word

of his clerk who was his brother-in- law# but he had -no first­
hand knowledge.
Armed with this statement# th® vmn and their lawyer
sought a rehearing.

They were given th© opportunity to appear

to ask for a rehearing and th,® union agent presented this

6
statement that th© lawyer had. obtained —the lawyer was not
allowed feo participate, except to be present — read the
statement of fch® motel owner Repicci, and the rehearing was
denied, You don't get a rehearing becaus® there is no new —
that's not new evidence, that's the same tiling you argued
the first time, totally overlooking th© distinction between
argument and evidence.
QUESTION s

Why must the employer be penalised for

the shortcoming© of the union here, ’which is your men's agent,
I assume?
MR, SCHWARTS si

Well, the employer — first of all,

th© employer is not to be penalized if he is ordered to
reinstate these men»
QUESTIONt

Well, he's claiming th® benefit of th©

arbitration procedure.

You say that the union didn't do a

good job at the arbitration procedure.
redound to th® employer's disadvantage?
MR. SCHWARTS:

Why should that
It wasn't his problem.

Th® employer should not be permitted

to claim the benefit of an arbitration procedure result which
is based on shoddy representation where all of the evidence
of innocence was not presented, it was an —
QUESTIONS

Aren't, they bound by the acts of th@ir

own agents?
MR. SCHWARTZ s
It was foisted upon them.

Th© agent was not selected by them.
Th© contract negotiated by the

7
company and the union left exclusive control of the grievance
in th® union, the man had no choice in that fact, and th®
company having vested that exclusive control over the
grievance in th- union is in a poor position to say, OK, now
wo want to reap the benefits of their abuse.
QUESTIONS
the union?

Why do.you,say th® company vested that in

The union represents th® majority of th© employees *

The union demanded that that be don®, didn't it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

For bargaining purposes, the union

' is the representative of th® employees.

Nothing in the lav/

requires that the mien have exclusive control of the

1 direct your attention to footnote 10

grievance proceeding.

©f th© opinion in Vaoa v. Sipes where it points out that
alternatives sewn» contracts permit the employees to have some
control ©v@r the processing of fchsir own grievance.

So that

th© company by its agreement vested that control in the
union representative.
QUESTIONS

But it was the demand of th® union as

the agent for th® employee© that that provision was put in
the contract, I take it.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Wall, we don't know how it was demanded.

Th© company and the union agreed to do it,
QUESTION?

Th© company is not your men1s agent and

the union is.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

St's not a willing agent under these

8
circumstances.

The record is replete with a long history

♦

of conflict between the

mmn on

the one hand and the union

representative and the company on the other with a lot of
evidence of a very friendly relationship b«itwe©n the company
and these union officials.
QUESTION*

If you prevail her©,» do you think the

company has a claim over and against, the union?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

No,

I think according to Vaca v. Sipes

and Czosek v. Q3Mara the company's liability is for back pay,
the union'© liability is for the extent to which its wrongdoing
increased the burden and expense of getting their jobs back
and collecting.
Now, when w© talk about the company’s good faith#
which is an argument that the company has mad®, I think it's
necessary to set that in context.

If indeed the company is

entitled to any cl.aim of good faith and based on the background,
we would deny that, nevertheless, that claim could only be
good up until September of 1968, as far as mitigation of the
back pay claim.

In September of 1968, th® men, having filed

application for unemployment compensation, Anchor defending
them vigorously on the ground that they were fired for just
cause, Anchor sent an airplane ticket to the motel for Mr.
Pagano to com® and testify in favor of the company against, the
men's BUG claim.
QUESTION*

Incidentally, has he ever been prosecuted?

9

MR. SCHWARTS:

H© has not, to my knowledge, your

Honor.
QUESTIONx

Hav® your people ©v@r filed any charges

against him?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Not to my knowledge.

Why not?

MR. SCHWARTZs

Well, I have already been involved

in a tremendous burden in this cas®.

It would not be

productive for my people to file charges against the

poor

motel clerk,,
QUESTION:

Yes, but it?a a crime, isn’t it?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

H©’s admitted to thre© crimes in

his affidavit, but it won’t advance the cause of my drivers
to prefer charges against him.

The company is free to do that

if they wish.
QUESTION:
is free to do it.

What does that answer state?

The company

Your people are th® ones who were defrauded

really.
MR. SCHWARTZ:
of his misconduct.

In that sense my people were victims

But again, it produces no recompense.

Th© plaintiffs aren’t mad© whole by prosecuting Mr. Pagano.
QUESTION:
victims of crimes?

Isn’t that often true with reference to
You are th© most injured parson.

Isn’t

that usually th© person who files th© criminal complaint?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Usually it is.

Usually it is.

10

QUESTION;

The- fact that fcher© is no profit in it

really has nothing to 'do with it, d©@s it?
MR. SCHWARTSs
it's a question of

Well? it's not a question of profit?

-fell® primary concern here being getting

thair jobs back and clearing their good names.

Prosecuting

Mr. Pagano wouldn’t clear their good name.
When Mr. Pagano cam© to Cleveland? or in Ohio, in
September of 1968 to testify at the BUC hearing, h© advised
the company on his «awn that what h© had told them before was
a lie, that he had pocketed the money, and the company

this

was unbeknownst to the plaintiffs, by the way -- the company
stating that because he changed his story h© w as not required
to testify, silently shipped him back to Batavia, never
informing th® plaintiffs of this fact, never offering to
reinstate them, never offering even just to clear their records
so that they could get another job somewhere ©is® and not have
to report that they were out of work because of dishonesty.
So if there is any company good faith it comas to
a startling, screeching halt in September of 1968.

Moreover,

the recent decisions of this Court, Albemarle and Butter-Res; ,
make it clear that good faith is not a defense par an to a
back pay claim.
QUESTION;

That’s a different kind of a back pay

claim, isn’t it?
MR. SCHWARTZ;

No, I am not proceeding under title VII,

11
nor am I proceeding as in Rutter-Rex in an unfair labor
practice action.

However, both the Albemarle and the Rutter-

opinions drew for its reasoning on a very old case cited,
Koppoch v. — I'm sorry, I don't h&v® the name of the —
it’s in my reply brief — Wicker v. Hoppock, 6 Wallace 94 at
99, relying on law from a breach of contract case.

So I

think that Rutfear-Rax and Albemarle ar© quite relevant to
this situation given the derivation of the decisions in those
easss.
Mow, as I indicated, thore was an
expensive background which if tins® permits I will go into,
but it's in the briefs if it's not, in terras of th©
relationship of th® company and the union and the man being
malcontents as far as both were concerned.
QUESTION:

They were transferred up to Lordstown

from Norwood, Ohio, w@re they not?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTIONs

That's correct, in 19 —

And worked in on th® seniority and there

was continuing resentment and bad blood, is that right?
MR» SCHWARTZs

Right.

Th© Norwood drivers were

particularly difficult from th© company standpoint or
unhappy from their standpoint because they were aware of the
better working conditions from their standpoint at Norwood
so they were unhappy at Lordstown.

Whereas, th® new hirees

at Lordstown, not having had the better experience at

12

Norwood were nor© complacent, and for that reason there was
soma conflict there.

And 'that was the genesis of the problem

and there was a wildcat strike in which a number of the
plaintiffs were ver/ active and complained about lack of
representation from the union and so forth.
At any rate» suit was filed in the district court
in Cleveland,

"n 1972 the company, after' discovery was

completed, filed a motion for summary judgment,
was overruled,

The motion

The case was set for trial four or five times

in the following year but somehow never came up.

A year later

the company files a virtually identical motion for summary
judgment, no new evidence, no new law, same argument, same
contention.
too.

This time the union makes the same arguments,

The international made different arguments.

The court

reversed itself, granted the motion for summary judgment against
all defendants,
W© appealed to the Sixth Circuit.

The Sixth Circuit

reversed with respect to Local 377 on the ground that the
svidenc© of a breach of the duty of fair representation was
sufficient for via to go to trial, but held that notwithstanding
that fact and that they may well have prejudiced the
reliability of the grievance result, the company was entitled
to th© benefit of it, the men were bound by it, and the
dismissal against the company was affirmed.

This was decided

without a great deal of discussion, without acknowledgement

13
of all of the contrary authority around tha country in
virtually ©very circuit, either by holding or dicta, that a
breach ©f fch® duty of fair representation entitles tha
palintiff to litigat® his breach of contract action against
Idie company.
This flows from ~ and the courts that have so hold
do so in larga part looking at Vaca.
Now, th® rule the Sixth Circuit sets up facilitates
the easy end run around Vaca.

You don * t have to not process

the grievance* you just do it perfunctorily.

You go through

the motions, and then it*s all final and binding and everything's
fine.

It makas no difference hov? good th® procedure or th©

substance is - as long,as you go through th® motions, it5 s
final and binding.
Secondly, this case is really mor® within Vaca
than it would appear for th© reason we are talking about a
joint, grievance proceeding rather than an arbitration,

hnd

a joint grievance proceeding is & proceeding in which there
ar© an. equal number of union and company representatives, and
if the union people vote for the union guy and th® company
p&'ople vote for tha company guy, it deadlocks and they;go to
, tha next layer, and so on and so forth.
How, what that means is that there is no way that
fch© men can lose their grievance at this stag® without some
union representatives voting against them.

So that is really

14
tantamount to a decision by the union not to process the
grievance any further, similar, not identical, but similar
to what the Court was discussing in Vaca v. Sipes.
QUESTION:

I suppose it would be possible to draw a

distinction between those cases where the grievance isn't
presented at all and. the employer's defense is exhaustion
rather than preclusion by operation of the grievance procedure.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It is possible to distinguish between

those two?
QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes. it is.
And

Vaca was of the former type,

wasn't it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Wei?, Vac* was a case which went to

the third or fourth lawyer when they decided not to process it
any further.
QUESTION:

It didn't go any farther.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And the employer would claim a failure to

exhaust.
MR. SCHWARTZ::
QUESTION:

Here all the steps were gon© through.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:
through.

Correct.

Well, but the —

I know, but they were purportedly gone

15

MR. SCHWARTZ;
QUESTION;

Yes.

How about Czosek?

MR. SCHWARTZ;

In Czosek the situation was one

with th© Railway Adjustment Board in a situation where the
plaintiff had a right to press his own grievance.,

He wasn't

limited to going to the company.
QUESTION;

That might be even still a different case.

MR. SCHWARTZ;
QUESTION;

That's a very different case, yes.

Her® the employer's defense wasn't failure

to exhaust but that you were bound by the result of the
arbitration procedure.
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

That's right.

That was his defense.

And those are two quite different things,

aren't they?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

They are two quite different things

but they tend to merge whan you look at a joint grievance
proceeding which is in reality a decision by the union not. to
push the matter any further.

There is no neutral arbitrator

who makes the decision —
QUESTION:

But you are not suggesting soma collusion

between the employer and th© union hare, are you?
MR. SCHWARTZ;
from the beginning.

Well, there is some suggestion of that

I don't think I have to prove that in. order

to prevail.
QUESTION;

Are you claiming that this whole business

16
was worked out between fch® employer and the union?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I am claiming that there is a

substantial likelihood of that,
QUESTION:

Thera is no eillegation of that ~ you

didn't allege that in your complaint.
MR. SCHWARTZs
QUESTIONS

It is?

MR. SCHWARTZ:
and circumstantially.
QUESTION:

It's alleged in the complaint,, but. —

-- it's proved only inferentially
There is no direct evidence of that.

I thought your case was that you didn't

get the proper representation on the part of the union and
under that circumstance you can't let the employer out because
there is no case ®van against the union unless there has been
a wrongful discharge, and:that in this circumstance with the
kind of allegations that you have made, which focus on the
union representation, as I understand it, not as anything
involving the employer, the employer is not free until that
issue is tried out to rely on the arbitration provision,
whatever it may be.

Isn't that what you are claiming?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is my basic fundamental argument.

But we also advance the contention that this didn't happen in
a vacuum, that one of the reasons that the 377 representative
sabotaged the grievance was because they had a very friendly
relationship in which they war® provided with cars and —
QUESTION:

Well, let me understand that.

Do we or do

17
we not nave a case here where what you ar© charging is
collusion between employer and union?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is a secondary claim, your Honor,

but that9s not the basic.
QUESTION:
for me.

Well, it would be a very differant case

It would be an easy on© if you were charging collusion

between employar and union.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, wo have charged that.

I think

that the case is stronger in terms of the evidence, in terras
of the fact that the union in bad faith misrepresented these
men because they, along with the company, wanted to get rid of
them because they were troublemakers..
QUESTION:

Where in your brief do you treat the

concept of collusion between the employer aid the union?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

It's treated in the ■—■

In these terms that you are now arguing.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, it's treated first of all in the

statement of facts setting forth on page 8 in very succinct
form the background showing a friendly relationship between the
union officials and the company, a hostile attitude on the part
of the company and the union toward these man.
QUESTION:

Is there something wrong with the .idea

of having a friendly relationship between the company

End the

union?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, your Honor, when that friendly

18
relationship incluctess the company furnishing the union officials
with cars, arranging for automobile purchase bargains for them,
hiring their relatives, there is something wrong with -that.
QUESTIONS
then.

You will have to show what that produces,

Where do you say this produced collusion and conspiracy

or whatever terms you want to apply to it?
MR. SCHWARTZs
QUESTION:

Well,

in —

I thought your claim was that it was

unfair to bind employees to the results of a grievance procedure
when their representatives didn't fairly present their case
for them.
MR. SCHWARTZs

That is one ~ can't I make two

claims, your Honor?
QUESTION?

Of course you can, but where do you make

the collusion, claim?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

The collusion claim is secondary

because concededly it's evidentiarily not as strong as I -think
the other proposition is.

It's advanced generally in

Peart III of the brief and Part IV dealing with the risks of
collusion and 'unfair representation in the joint grievance
proceeding,

tod all of this is said in the context of the

relationship between the company and the union.
QUESTION;

Mr. Schwarts, our grant of certiorari

here was limited, was it not? It was limited to ~
MR. SCHWARTZ;

To the question,

stated.

19
QUESTION?

And certainly in fch® question stated as

shown on page 4 of your brief, I don't see where there is
anything raised about collusion.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, your Honor, in stating ~

Do you see anything in that question

presented that suggests any issue of collusion?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Th® statement on its face does

Th® union can’t even clear

MR. SCHWARTZ:

It can never undo the fact that they

ara permanently discharged from the Anchor Motor Freight Company
for dishonesty, your Honor.
Now, Anchor says it’s unfair because of its good
faith.

Well, Anchor discharged tlx® plaintiffs, the union

didn't discharge thss plaintiffs.

Anchor gave total control

over fcha grievance handling, to the union.

The plaintiffs

didn’t, do that.
QUESTIONS

You say that there was not prim faci®

M.R. SCHWARTZ:

No, I don’t,,

At the initial time the

But there was overwhelming

evidence of innocence, in fact, in light of the evidence
subsequently gathered, there is no evidence of guilt that's
left.
The company, having discharged the men, is not and
cannot be penalized by reinstating them if, as the evidence
indicates, the men sir® innocent of the wrongdoing with which
they were charged.

Then, indeed, the company should be

delighted to have back eight highly experienced -- six now,
two are deceased ~ six highly experienced truck drivers who
have been cleared.

But that’s not the company’s opinion,

attitude, and that calls into question the handling of the
Pagano thing, calls into question their good faith from the
very inception.

Their conduct with Pagano on th© Bureau of

Unemployment Compensation hearing was, as has been argued by a

21
more eminent advocate recently, a kind of a 13fch stroke of a
clock that calls into question the first 12 strokes and causes
question ab initio about the company’s good, faith.
For all of these reasons w© would urge that the
Court reverse the decision of the Sixth Circuit in favor of
Anchor Motor Freight and remand the case finally for trial in
Cleveland — this is a sura-nary judgment proceeding so far —and I would reserve the remainder of my tine.
Thank you.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Schwartz, if you prevail and the case

is retried, I take it the company8s host line of defans© would
be that there was: — you would sue the union and the company
both.
MR. SCHiWARTZ:
QUESTION?

They've been sued together.

Fight.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Not retried, however, your Honor.

There has never been a trial.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

You are here on

summary judgment motion, but at trial, you would have the
union as defendant, and you would have to prove that there had
been a breach of its duty fairly to represent feh® petitioners.
MR. SCHWARTZ:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And if you prevailed on that issue, then

you would reach the second issue which is the ~
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Wrongful discharge.

22

QUESTION?

Which is whether or not the discharge

was wrongful»
MR» SCHWARTZ;

Eight.

That’s correct.

And I hava

to make the threshold issue first before we reach the wrongful
discharge.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.

Very well.

Mi:. Goldfarb.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD S. GCLDFAKB
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GOLDFARB.;
th® Court:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

I think this cas® has to be looked at in the

greater context of labor-management relations.

We

have to

look at, it from th© standpoint of th® congressional mandat©
to amicably settle disputes between employers and unions,.
We have to look at it from th® derivative rights of employees
under labor agreements.

We have to look at it from th© union’s

statutory duty to represent, and we also have to look at it
from th© employer's standpoint and what, are his rights.
Now# .!*•. order to correct any misapprehensions that
th.© petitioners have, no employ®3: vests anything in a union#
particularly control of a grievance machinery.

These ar©

bargained for# negotiated# and resolved at th© bargainingtable, approved by union membership in the same agreement that
establishes their wages, holiday# vacation, and pension.

And

23
it's almost inconceivable how they can accept th® benefits of
that agreement and reject th© grievance machinery .
In tills particular case the men were accused of
falsifying their expense sheets by turning in inflated motel
receipts over and above what, they actually paid for their
lodgings while they were on the road»

Affidavits of the motel

clerk and th© owner specifically stated that the men requested
these receipts.

Even in th© deposition, and it’s in th®

record, where on© witness recants and say3 that he lied, he
says that this is a normal practice of th® motels in the area
to give inflated receipts to drivers in order to get business.
But in any ©vent, th® case that went before the
Grievance Committee, th© same typo of committee that was
approved by this Court in Humphrey v, Moore, th® same type of
committee that’s negotiated and approved by the membership,
that committe® had before it th® men who were involved, the
affidavits of the motel clerk and the motel owner, th© records,
th® receipts, and th® hearing took several hours, and'all th®
men had an opportunity to talk, and all the issues of
credibility of th® witnesses, fch® motel clerk, and th© owner
were in issue before that arbitral body.
QUESTIONS

How was th® credibility of th® people that

filed an affidavit assessed?

That8s right.

You didn*t r@al.ly mean that, did you?

H@ didn“t testify, did he?
MR. GOLDFARBs
QUESTION;

They had an affidavit of his.

How does that go to credibility?

MR. GOLDFARB:

Because the drivers denied th©

applioacy of that affidavit.

Th© drivers said that that

motel clerk was not tailing th® truth in that affidavit.
QUESTION:

And the committee decided that th©

credibility laid with th© man who mad© an affidavit against
the man who testified.
MR. GOLDFARB s

Obviously, the arbitral body accepted

the affidavit ovsr and above what the drivers said, th®
notarised affidavit.

So the credibility, at least from our

standpoint, was an issue.
in any event, after th® arbitral body decided th©
cas© in favor of th© company, a lawyer was hired who want to
Batavia, New Yore, and interviewed the mot®! owner, Mr. Repecci,
and all his affidavit said was that h@ knew no more about this
cas© than his brother-in-law th© motel clerk witness Pagano
said.

And armed with that affidavit they returned to the

Grievance Committee and requested a rehearing.

And the

Grievance Committee reconvenes, examines the affidavit of
Repecci for purposes of rehearing, and comes to th® conclusion

25
that there really isn’t any n®w evidence in this case,

arbitration process is exhausted h® says, ”1 wasn’t -telling

Now', according to the petitioners, at that point
they stat® in their brief that right then and there ipso facto
the arbitral award is vitiated, there is nc longer any evidence
of any dishonesty, and the men should automatically be
reinstated.

We submit to this Court that these arbitration

awards have some legal applicacy.

Mr, Goldfarh, I take it, them, that your

MR* GCLDFARBs

Our position is that th® discharges

were not wrongful, that there has bean a determination that
they can’t conceivably be wrongful at this stag© of the gam®.
Ther© is no evidence of any misconduct on th© part of the

21
MR. GCLDFARBs
QUESTION;

Not conceded, your Honor.

But certainly the court of appeals decided

the case on the assumption that the employer

should be

dismissed ©van if there had been, a wrongful discharge.
MR. GCLDFARBs
QUESTION;

Correct, your Honor.

And because of refusing summary judgment

against the union, left those issues in feho case.
MR. GCLDFARBs

For the simple reason that they are

two different types of wrong.
QUESTION;

All right.

But nevertheless, as the case

comes to us, the issue is whether the employers should b©
dismissed even if he. wrongfully discharged them.
MR. GCLDFARBs

Correct.

Now, there are two distinct

individual wrongs 5 one arises out of a breach of a statutory
duty, the unfair representation, and a wrongful discharge
arises out of a breach of contract.
Nov/, this is precisely where w® are at.

According

to the petitioners, they feel that if there was an unfair
representation charged, they automatically have the right to
relitigate th@ wrongful discharge.

We disagree with that.

W©

disagree with chat, because if that's true, under the present
state of the court of appeals opinion where an allegation of
bad faith is not amenable to summary judgment and must be
litigated and what petitioners say if they make that allegation

QUESTIONS

Th® Vaca case is distinguishable.

Maybe Vacs, is wrong, but doesn't it read

MR» GCLDFARB:

I don't think it does.

Vaca does not

read on this issue because Vacs, did not have th® employer
involved, Vace, did not go to any final arbitration, Vaca did
not — the heart of Vaca does not concern itself with finality

Th® man is entitled to be heard and

QUESTIONS

At least th® employer then knows there

MR. GCLDFARBs

Precisely.

We knew where we stand,

w® know what risks we are exposed to, and we know that w© are
taking a chance until that man has his grievance resolved.

34
But until that happens, we should be put on some kind of
notice that we are going to be exposed to noma kind of jeopardy.
And if the man himself doesn't affirmatively take soma action,
wa never know what our liability is under this contract.

There

is no stability, w® don't have any ground rules, wa don't have
any way of relying on the good faith collective bargaining.
How, I want to talk just briefly about remedies.
The petitioners seem to feel that if the employer is not kept
in this case, for no other reason whatsoever, the men cannot
get a favorable remedy.

Now, that would be a unique proposi­

tion to keep e, party in a case because of not liability, but
simply because of collectibility.

And unless there is some

nexus to some wrongdoing, some collusion, some tain in the
machinery whex® there is a legal basis for keeping the employer
in litigation, collectibility in and of itself certainly
cannot be the basis for keeping an employes’ in as a party
defendant to a. lawsuit.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Goldfafb, I don't understand that to

be your brother's submission. It is, rather, that the damage
that
to these employeas/resulted from the failure of statutory
representation on the part of their agent was their wrongful
discharge and that only tlx© employer can repair that damage
because only the employer can reinstate them.

That's the

simple submission, as I understand it, not about collectibility.
MR. GOLDFARB:

Well, to address myself to that

35

particular question -~
QUESTI01:15

That was my understanding of it.

MR. GOLDFARB s

Perhaps I didn'1 understand the

question.
QUESTIONS

My question was,

do you think you are

fairly paraphrasing your brother's position/ because I
thought you weren't as I understood it.
MR. GOLDFARB?

1 think I am.

He said, if I under­

stood him correctly, and I thin?; h® takes the position in his
brief that unless th® employer is kept in this case without
regard to what happened before, th® men would b® without a
remedy.
QUESTION?

Because they could not be reinstated.

Only th© employer could reinstate
MR. GOLDFARB:
QUESTION;

Correct.

That's self-evident, is it not?

MR. GOLDFARB;

And th© bench addressed th© question

that h@ could get a remedy from th© union.
QUESTION;

MR. GOLDFARB' But not reinstatement, that's correct.
QUESTION;

And th© remedy for wrongful discharge» is

MR. GOLDFARB

Yea, but th® posture of this case

bsfor© this Court is that the wrongful discharge has been

adjudicated and there is soma finality.
QUESTION?

And the way —

They ara not asking for back pay?

Are

they asking for back pay here?
MR. GOLDFARB:

Originally in -their complaint they

asked for back pay.
QUESTION?

Nall, if the employer is in the district

court, h© is certainly exposed to a very, very large back pay
award.
MR. GOLDFARB s
QUESTION?

Correct.

Apart from reinstatement.

MR. GOLDFARBs

That’s correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

But the union can also satisfy, a back pay award in money
damages.
QUESTION?

Right.

And fch@y can satisfy a claim

measured by the loss, the value of the failure to gat
reinstatement, even though that's very difficult, to evaluate.
MR. GOLDFARB:

It wouldn't b@ unique because it's

don© in wrongful death cases, it's don© in all kinds of cases
where you have to project earnings into the future,

The

union in and of itself could satisfy any kind of a money claim.
QUESTION:

As I understood, Mr. Goldfarb, your

colleague's position is that these employees have no cause of
action against the union for failure to give adequate
representation in a discharge case unless, in. fact -Idler© has
been a wrongful discharge, and that therefor© you have to

37
keep the employer in on the issue of whether or not there has
been a wrongful discharge before h® has any cause of action at
all for failure to give proper representation against the
union,
Now, then, he goes on, as I understand him, or so he
answered me earlier, as I understood him, to argue that in
this instance you can't rely on th® arbitration award because
that award was not th© product of a proper representation on
the part of th® union.
MS. GOLDFARB:
QUESTION:

We say ~

1 know what you say, but that's his

position.
MR. GOLDFARB:
QUESTION:

That's his position.

As Mr. Justice Stewart, was suggesting to

you earlier, your characterization of his position doesn't
seem quite accurate.
MR. GOLDFARBs

That's 'the reading I got of it, but

in any event, this case boils down to a very simple proposition
that once there has been an adjudication in th,© machinery
and the employer is free from any wrong, he shouldn't be
exposed to tha jeopardy of going through any kind of litigation
if th® union was guilty of unfair representation.
QUESTION:

But th© duty of fair representation is

a statutory duty, isn't it?
MR. GOLDFARB:

That's right.

38

QUESTION:

And your opponent’s argument is that

th© finality attached to the grievance procedure shouldn’t
obtain in full force unless -the statutory duty has been
satisfied, that the assumption on which finality is based is
that the statutory obligations have been satisfied.
MR. GOLDFARB;
that type of situation.

What inherent evils there would b® in
Haw easy it would be for a union

to be guilty of unfair representation and take a chance on
the arbitration decision; if they won, it would be fin®, if
they lost, the unions could holler "foul," that w® didn’t
fairly represent this man, we want another trial.

Why should

the employer be infected with what th© union fails to do in
its statutory duty?
QUESTION

Are there som© ca3@s ;hat have gone with

you on this matter?
MR. GOLDFARB:

No, this is a cas«, from my standpoint,

of first significance.
QUESTION?

There are cases against you, though,

aren’t there?
MR. GOLDFARB;

Not

your Honor, I respectfully

submit to you, sir, there ar© not any cases against me where
there has been am arbitration.
QUESTION;

Where there has been exhaustion.

MR. GOLDFARB;

When there has been exhaustion.

There

are plenty of casas that philosophically discuss the question,

33

like Vaca does# assuming ther® was a wrongful discharge and
a failur® to represent and then they 9° Qn and talk about
apportionment--assuming a wrongful discharge-

Our posture

hare today is without th® assumption, we are dealing with the
reality of an adjudication-

And so as a result we say we

have got a case of soma significance her© where th® Court has
an opportunity to delineate some employer rights.
QUESTION:

You are quit® right, Mr. GoIdfart, this

Court's cases, way back to the Steelworkers Trilogy, hav® put
vary special emphasis on tho values in labor relations of the
arbitration procedures, and 1 ©xpsct what you are concerned
with as an employer's representative is that those procedures
may not mean as much as you used to believe they did if we
are going to say that you can’t interpose them as a defense
in th® circumstances alleged hors.
MR. GQLDFARB:

QUESTION:

That’s collusion.

MR. GC5LDFARBs

1 don’t think there is any question

about that either, because that takas two, it’s bilateral then.
But where on® party is innocant, I don’t think w® should be
prejudiced.
QUESTION:

Doesn’t this case allage that?

MR. GOLDFARB:
QUESTION:

No.

It didn’t?

41
MR. GOLDFARB:
QUESTION 5

No.
Thu question presented certainly

doesn’t put that to this Court.
If you have collusion between the union and th©
employer, almost by definition you have the sort of fraud
that would b© included in the grounds for reviewing arbitration.
MR. GOLDFARB;

There would b© no question about: it.

I think If both were parties to any kind of wrong that would
taint the machinery, there isn’t a doubt in my mind that
there would be no validity to the arbitral process.

But where

there is no taint to the machinsjry and where, for example, in
this cas® the court of appeals merely suggested that bad faith
ought to b® litigated and not be handled by summary judgment
and vindicated the employer's position and gave finality to
the arbitral process, I think if this Court would return the
cas© to tea status of the district court, we would avoid a
multiplicity of actions in trying these cases before
arbitration boards and then trying them again before labor
boards and teen trying them again before district courts»
QUESTION;

Well, the district court granted summary

judgment against all the parties, didn't it?
MR. GOLDFARB;
QUESTION;

Yes.

And the court of appeals reversed it as

to on© and no review was sought of that, was it?
MR. GOLDFARB;

No, your Honor.

42
QUESTIONS

So we are without power to do what you

ask us to do.
QUESTION;

Is the effect of the district court9s

action now affirmed -- or the court of appeals' action remanding
the case for trial on the merits as against the union any
more or less than a declaration that they may have an action
against the union for failure to represent them properly?
MR. GOLDFARB s

I think fch@ present posture of the

case is precisely that , that they have an action against the
union for any damages they may have suffered, regardless of what
it may he.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NIKI Z. SCHWARTZ ON

MR, SCHWARTZ:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

1 think it's important to point out that the action

against the employer her© is a breach of contract action# not

43
a tort action# not a criminal action.

Thar© is no requirement

of proof of men3 r@a or evil intent in a breach of contract
action# and on that basis the employer either breached the
contract or h© didn't# irrespective of whether he was in good
faith or not in good faith.

To say that the discharge was

not wrongful because it's been adjudicated in a grievance
proceeding is simply to pull himself up by his own bootstraps.
That's the very issue here, is how much are w© going to

deficient representation in bad faith resulted in a total lack
of exculpatory avidenc®.
