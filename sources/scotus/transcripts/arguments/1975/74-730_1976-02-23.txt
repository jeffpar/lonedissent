MR, CHIEF JUSTICE' BURGER:

We will hear arguments

r&essfe in No. 74-730, John C, Reamer against Board of Public
Works o£ Maryland.
Mr. Greenwald, you may proceed when you are ready
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. GREENWALD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. GREENWALD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is an appeal from the United States District
Court of Three Judges for the District, of Maryland.
At issue is the constitutionality

of a Maryland

law which authorises the direct payment of public aid to
church-related and other private colleges.
The Appellants are four Maryland citizens and
taxpayers.
the

They contend that this Maryland law

violates

Establishment Clausa of the First Amendment as applied,

to the states through the Fourteenth.
The Appellees are four church-related colleges of
Maryland as well as the members of the Board of Public
Works of Maryland which is charged with administering the
statuta.
A three-judge panel, which had been convened,
upheld the constitutionality of this legislation by a twoto-on© vote.

4
At the outset, I'd like to invite the Court's
attention to at least one major distinction between this
legislation and other church-state legislation previously
considered by the Court.
This legislation provides for a general-purpose
grant to be paid directly to church-related colleges.

It

is not limited, for example, to construction grants such
as this Court upheld in 1971 in Tilton

versus Richardson.

The act at issue would allow the payment of both
capital and operating expenditures with state aid and so
the aid could be used fox* construction, maintenance and
repairs of buildings, teachers' salaries, scholarships and
virtually any of the myriad of costs which are incurred by
church-related collecres.
QUESTION:

But there is some limitation.

MR. GREEN’, JALD:

The only use-restriction,

Mr. Justice Brennan, is found in Section 58*-A of the Act,
which states that "No money shall be used for
purposes.’"'

sectarian

That is the only use-restriction which is in the

act or in the recently-promulgated regulations.
In order for a college to be eligible for aid, it
must meet a variety of secular requirements.

For example,

it must be a non-profit educational institution.

It must

be private, accredited by the State Board of Education and
so forth.

5
The only eligibility requirement relating to
religion is that the institution cannot be one* awarding only
seminarian cr tehological degrees and so an institution
such as -fount Saint Mary’s College

one of the Appellees —

which awards both seminarian degrees and liberal arts
degrees may be eligible for aid under the Act,
As I indicated earlier, the Act is administered
under the State Board of Public Works.

The Board of Public

Works is assisted by the Council for Higher Education,
which undertakes the nuts and bolts, day-to-day

adminis­

tration off the Act.
The administration of the Act includes a threestate process of enforcing the use for sectarian purposes
restriction.

The first stage is a full expenditure report

which is filed annually by the school with the state.
Thin, according to the recently-promulgated
regulations, identifies the purposes for which the aid is
intended to be used and includes an affidavit by the
Institution that the aid will not be used for sectarian
purposes.
The second stage, again, furnished on an annual
basis, is n so-called "utilization of funds report.This
is a second report furnished by the Institution to the
state which describes how the aid, in fact, has been used.
The third stage of enforcement of

use

6
restriction involves necessary follow-up by the states to
ascertain that the aid was not used for religious purposes.
This follow-up nay be in the form of inquiries by the state
to the institution for more details as to how the aid was
used and nay also be in the form of audit, to which these
expenditures are subject.
As of the judgment, there were 18 «aid recipients
in Maryland.

Four of these, four appellees, are admittedly

church-related institutions.
Now, the Appellees, as I have said, are admittedly
church-related «and the lower court especially found that
they v;ere church-related.
The lower court also found that their predominant
mission is the functioning as the secular educational
institution„
The lover court also found that it has -- that
all of the schools have as secondary objectives the
encouragement of spiritual development of the students.
This finding as to secondary objectives is plainly supported
by the record and by the schools' own perceptions themselves
For example, Loyola College expressly identifies
with the Catholic and Jesuit tradition.

The other

Appellees have similar expressions of identification.
This Court’s decisions have furnished us with a
three-fold framework of analysis in establishment clause

7
questions.
In order for a statute to survive an establishment
clause challenge, it must have a secular legislative
purpose.

Its principal or primary effect must neither

advance nor inhibit religion and the statute must not foster
excessive novarnment entanglement with religion.
The Appellants here, as below, offer no challenge
as to the secular legislative purpose of the statute.
However, the Appellants do challenge the statute
on the grounds that it promotes excessive government
entanglement with religion and that its primary effect is
to advance religion.
I'd like to first turn to the issue of entangle"* •
ment and running through an analysis of entanglement,
according to this —
QUESTION:
me out on one thing?

Mr. Greenwald, would you straighten
Western Maryland Collage is no longer

in the case.
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

And how and why did they opt out?

MR. GREENWAID:

A settlement was reached between

Western Maryland Colle re and the Appellants.
i

QUESTION:

Well, how does one settle a case such

as this where you are dialing with a state statute?
MR. GREENWALD.

Western Maryland College, your

8
Honor, through the litigation, had taken the position that
it was not a church-related college.

Yefc the lower court

plainly found that at least certain vestiges of churchrelnfcedness remained.

The settlement was predicated on

the removal, by Western Maryland College, of even these
vestiges of church-relatedness.
The Appellants agreed to dismiss the appeal if
Western Maryland would remove the vestiges of churchrelatedness.
QUESTION:

Would you describe what the vestiges

we re?
MR. GR3ENWALD:
your Honor.

I can describe some of them,

Those included religious symbols oh. the facades

of buildings and inside some of the buildings.
Maryland College agreed to remove them.

Western

These included the

financial support of a certain council which operated for
religious purposes in Western Maryland College.
Financial support was not a major item, but it
was there and Western Maryland agreed not to support it.
It included a direct tie-in to the sponsoring church and
the furnishing of certain reports to that church.
It agreed to remove this.
It included a department of philosophy and
religion in which all of the teachers were clerics of the
sponsoring order and it agreed with the normal attrition

9
applicable to these individuals such as through retirement
or illness or death or "what-not to replace them so that
the make-up of that department x^ould not be all clerics
of the sponsorina faith,
I don't recall other specific instances,, but the
settlement agreement also included the general provision
that Western Maryland Collage would remain totally neutral
as to the furtherance of spiritual development of students
QUESTION:

Although it continued to give

degrees in theology.
NR, GRHHNWAL.D:

Your Honor» I don't recall

whether Western Maryland College gave degrees in theology.
QUESTION:

They had courses in theology.

MR. OREENNALD:
QUESTION:

They had courses.

They had a department.

MR. CREST?ALO:

They had a department, your

Honor, of philosophy and religion which included certain
religion courses.

They took the position throughout

litigation that these religion courses were taught in a
strictly academic manner and they agreed that any religion
courser? that they had would continue to bo taught in an
academic manner.
I do not know that they had a

major in theology

I just don't recall.
QUESTION:

But you — I suppose you would have

10

accepted that if you ~~ if you would accept the fact that,
they teach theological courses, you would accept, if they
did, the fact that they gave degrees in theology.
MR. GREENWALD:

If

by that you mean, would 'X

accept it for purposes of a settlement, I would have
accepted that, yes.
i

I would point out, Mr. Justice White, that 1
would draw a sharp distinction between the academic
teachers of theology and non-academic teaching of theology.
QUESTION:

Nell, all the schools do, don’t they?

At least they claim they do,
MR. GREENWALD:

They claim to.

There is serious

question about that and as the lower court expressly found,
or expressly did not find, it was unable to characterize
exactly how theolooy was taught at these schools„

Theology

was the area which I think gave the lower court the most
difficulty.
Turning ahead to the issue of entanglement,
running through the entanglement analysis„ the concept that
\

it is not necessarily actual entanglement which requires
the statutes be struck down on establishment clause grounds
Potential entanglement will suffice.
QUESTION:

But it must be excessive, not'merely

entanglement, must it not?
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes.

11
QUEf>TIO’I:

That is the r ubber word that is

involved here.
'TO. CTOJCMWALD:

That is correct.

There must be

'XccusivG entanglement.
do'-;, this Court's decisions teach us that an
analysis of excessive entanglement necessarily involves an
with three variables.
equation/ The three variables are the character and
purposes of the institution, the nature of the aid and the
resulting relationship between the church and state.
This Court’s decisions also teach us that these
variables are to be judged on a case-by-case basis and in
the final analysis, it is the cumulative effect of variables
in any given case which determines whether or not the
statute at issue is constitutions.!.
Turning to the variable, character

id p-.irpo .-.;es

of the institution, the lower court expressly held that the
schools here conformed, in character and purposes, to those
schools which were approved for aid in Tilton versus
•

nrdson in 1971,
However, running through its opinion are, I submit,

two distinctions between these schools and the Tilton
schools.

In Tilton, this Court employed as a foundation

the absence of any restriction based upon religion on
faculty appointments„
In respect to these schools, the lower court

12

expressly found that there was a policy or practice, at
leant in part, of faculty recruitment based upon religion.
More specifically* Loyola College admittedly
and as the lower court found — has the policy of attempting
to recruit to its faculty two members of the Sisters of
Mercy and two members of the Society of Jesus* both o£
which are sponsoring religious orders.
That is not to say that if Loyolii is unable to
find members who are qualified, they will not turn to
people of other religions and hire them.

They will.

Nonetheless, their affirmative policy is to
recruit members of these religious orders.
It is Appellants' contention that, to the extent
Loyola or any other school has a policy of recruitment, at
least in part, based upon religion, it necessarily has the
corollary

policy of not recruiting people from other

religious backgrounds than those of the sponsoring order,
QUESTION:

What is the composition overall of

the faculty you are describing at Loyola?

What percentage

were representatives of a particular religious faith?
MR. GREENWALDs

I don't know the exact percentage.

This information was unavailable at trial.

Of course, as

I recall, records of each particular individual's religion
are simply not kept.
There were, as I. recall, approximately 20 to 25

13
percent of the faculty members who were either Roman. Catholic
priests or members of: the Sisters of Mercy.

This informa­

tion was available since the catalog identified by certain
symbols members of these religious orders.
QUESTION:

Does the record show whether or not

when they taught they were dressed in their clerical
clothing to identify their full-time occupation and
association?
MR. GPJEENWALD:
so dressed and

The record shows that some were

others were not.

This was something that

was left up to the particular teachers.

Similarly, some

four religious symbols, which is crosses and similarly some
classrooms had in them crucifixes for the religious symbols
and some did not and 1 don't know the precise numbers.
QUESTION:

Having the affirmativa policy you

described, that is, recruiting annually two Sisters of
Mercy, two members of the Society of Jesus, couldn't you at
least know in the case of Loyola what the percentage was
of Roman Catholic faculty?
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Well, I —

I understood you just to say you

couldn't answer Mr. Justice Powell as to the

percentage of

the total faculty who were religiously oriented.
MR. GREENWALD:

Mr. Justice Brennan, I am able

to stata that approximately 20 to 25 percent of the •

14

faculty included members of either the Society of Jesus or
other Roman Catholic priests.
QUESTION:

Each of these are only at Loyola.

At each of these schools.
MR. GREENWALD:
Loyola Collega.

No, sir,.1 am talking now of

The percentages did vary.

The percentages

were greater in St. Joseph College and 1 have forgotten
exactly what the percentage was, but it was something like
60 or 70 percent of the teaching faculty which was made up
of members of the sponsoring religious order, the Daughters
of Charity and the College of Notre Dame and Mount Saint
Mary’s College had percentages, as I recall, which were in
betweenthat is, of clergy.
What I said I didn't know was the number of
faculty which were Catholic as opposed to some other
religion.

That, I am not able to identify at all.
Now, the College cf Notre Dame and Saint Joseph

Cpllene, as the lower court found, also have practices of
Recruiting faculty based on religion.
The lower court found that the reason for this
was budgetary.

That is, that it involved less expense to

the schools involved to invite and receive to their
faculties members of these religious orders than independent
persons and that was the reason for that.
There is another major distinction between these

15
institutions and those which were involved in Tiiton versus
Richardson.

In Tilton, this Court pointed out that theology

was taught academically but this was based upon a stipulation
bv the parties to Tilton that theology was, in fact» taught
a ca dei"i c a 11 y.
There was no such stipulation in this case.

As

I've indicated earlier, the court had considerable diffi­
culty with the whole question of theology.
It found itself unable to characterize one way
or the other whether theology was taught academically or
religiously.

However, it did recognize that given the

limited selection of courses

at these schools and given

that this limited selection was focused upon Christianity
and given that the courses were taught primarily and in
some cases exclusively by clerics of the sponsoring faith,
there existed at least the potential that theology could
be used to further the secondary purpose of these
institutions, that is, the religious purpose.
OUbhTIO'J:

Mr. Greenwald, what is the difference

between teaching theology academically and teaching it
religiously?
MR. GREKMT7ALD:

I can only reply in the most

acne ml terms, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I think when you

teach about religion, that is, when you teach that at a
certain age, certain people believe X, Y and

z

and

16
similarly, other people believed A, B and C -- in other
words, you teach the historical evolution and you teach the
modern-day beliefs of people, that is teaching about
religion.

That is academically.
However, when you teach

purport to teach as

a natter of fact that at a given time the Messiah had
a
come and that/certain person, Jesus Christ, was the
Messiah and that all members of the Roman Catholic Church,
in order to save their souls, must believe these things,
that is teachina religiously.
Now, obviously, there are all sorts of shades of
grey which one could impose.
QUESTION:

Well,

That is my understanding.

let's take it over to -- suppose

it is a philosophy course rather than a religion course
and the professor is teaching the history of philosophy and
he happens to feel that Kant was right and Hume was wrong,
in his notions about epistemology.

Now, I take it that in

a normal college course the professor is perfectly free -presenting the subject objectively, but to express a
preference for one or the other.
MR. REISENWALD:
QUESTION:

I think he is.

Or at least not to treat them completely

as if they were — he were dissecting a frog the way you
describe the historical teaching of religion or the
academic treatment of it.

17
MR. GREEN'. JALD:

Well, the dissection of a frog

is the clearest example I could think of for the academic
teaching of theology.

As I have indicated, Mr. Justice

Rohnquist, there are many shades of grey in here.
I think what he says is correct, that a teacher
can teach A view is, 3 view is, my preference is and I
think that would be academic teaching.
QUESTION:

That would still be academic.

MR. GREENNALD:

I 'would say so.

*

QUESTION:

What he cannot

teach is a certain

theological tenet is true and everything else is false.
MR. GREENWALD:

That is correct.

QUESTION: That is no longer the academic teaching
of conparitive religion or the history of religion or
sorrotiiina like that, but it is theological propaganda, if
you will use that vford.
"El. GREENWALD:

I. think that is correct but

Mr. Justice Stewart, I
QUESTION:

In order to inculcate specific theolo­

gical tenets.
MR. ORKENWALD:
the key.

Well, that is right and that is

The inculcation of specific tehological tenets

Is, I think, largely a matter of degree.
extremely subtly.

It can be done

It doesn't have to be done as blatantly

as I just described and so in the continued emphasis in a

18
theology class about the professors own individual beliefs
happen to coincide with the beliefs of the sponsoring order,
you at least have the potential that the line or the wall
of separation would be abridged in that course and, it is
that potential against which the establishment clausa must
guard»
QUESTION:

Mr, Greenw&ld, while we have

interrupted you already in your thoughts, is there a
distinction between a

school which is church-related

i

&s I understand it, these schools are adndted by everyone
to be church-related -- ansi being sectarian.

Do those

terms mean different things and if so, what is the
difference?
MR. GREBNWALD:
answer, Mr, Justice

That is a difficult question to

Stevens,

I would say that the

guidance from this Court’s decisions is to dato' unclear,
Xn Hunt yersue McNair, this Court referred to a

sectarian institution as on® in which religion is so
pervasive that, in effect, its secular and religious
functions merged.

The one is subsumed with the other.

That, rn general terms, given the guidance of
Hunt versus McNair, is how I would describe a sectarian
institution.
QUESTION:
that standard.

You don’t contend these schools meet

19
QUESTION t

You dem51 contend these schools would

satisfy that standard?

•■n.

GREENWALD:

I did so contend but the lower

court expressly ruled that these schools were not
pervasively sectarian.
QUESTION t

But you are not challenging.that

finding on appeal, either.
MR. GREENWALDs

Yes, I am and I propone to

identify three specific factors, any one of which,1
submit placed these schools in the pervasively sectarian
category.

I can do so right now in response to your

question, if you like.
QUESTIONS

Just before you proceed, isn't it

true that the vast majority of private colleges and
universities are or at least historically were churchrelated, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Wittenberg,
Kenyon.
MR. GREENWALDs

It is my understanding that,

from a historical point of view, that is correct.
QUESTION:
1

So every — there may be exceptions ,

know of one in Indiana, but the vast majority

of private

colleges and universities are church-related, are they not?
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTIONs
vestigially.

Well, at one time they ware.

Well, and still ar®, at least

20

MR. GREENWMjD2
church-relatedness„

Given school© have vestiges of

Sure they are.

But 2 would point out

that that, in itself, doesn't really answer any question
dealing with the establishment clausa because, as this
Court has taught us, it is the degree of church-re1atedness
which is an important factor.
QUESTION:

So it is — is it a matter in each

case of degree rather than of two separate categories
between church-related on the on® hand and sectarian — it
is how much church-related, is it not?
MR. GREENWALD%

I would say yes.

I agree with

that, Mr. Justice Stewart, with on® exception.

I think

that there are certain factors which may be applicable to
a church-related school which in and of themselves would
disqualify those schools from aid.
One of the factors, which X think is present in
this case, is the introduction of prayer into the class­
rooms.

Why do X think this is important?

The entire

premiss upon which this Court in the past has permitted
state aid or federal aid to church-related institutions is
that the religious functions are separable from the socalled secular functions.
With respect to private colleges, the secular
functions at bottom is the classroom teaching of given
subjects.

I submit that there is no more cogent way to

21
mingi® the religious into the secular educational function
than by introducing prayer into the class»
Now, in fact, each of the

Appellees, as -the lower

court found, had a practice of prayer in the class»
lower

The

court'found this practice to be what the lower court

termed "peripheral" to the teaching of the various subjects»
However, prayer was introduced by the teachers
in a wide variety of courses»

For example, chemistry,

mathxnafcics, business administration, physics, not to leave
out, of course, philosophy and theology,
QUESTION:

The students were

Tha fact is that many did,

but many others did not,
QUESTION:

What if you had a biology professor

at Harvard who chose to begin his biology courses each

22
session with prayer?

Would that make Harvard an irsparrcis^

sib la recipient of governmental aid?
"iR. GREENWALD:

Well, that, too, Mr. Justice

Stewart, is vary difficult to answer and 1 can only
answer it this way —
QUESTIONs

Well, I thought your point 'was that

if there are prayers in a classroom ever, that that is &
touchstone, that is a litmus paper test as to Whether or
not something is impermissibly church-related.
MR. GRESNW&LD:

That is correct and to direct3.y

respond to your question, X would say that if Harvard did
so permit a prayer in a classroom, it should not receive
the state aid.

Now, the question —

QUESTION:

Harvard prides itself — at least, the

last I knew it did, with being a free institution and if
a particular professor decided that — in soology or
biology that he wanted to open his classes with prayer
end any students who wanted to join in could join in, others
were free not to or even to arrive 1st®.
Would‘that in and of itself make Harvard an
institutionally-!rapermissible recipient of government aid?
MR. GREEWWALD:
it should.

Wall, a© I have answered before,

But the question which 1 think h©s to.be

answered — wall, first, we don't reach thst question in
this case.

Her©, you don’t have one instance of a prayar

23
in a biology class.

You have instances of prayer ranging

from 5? courses, roughly, at Loyola College which meant
sIk

to eight percent of the courses to an overwhelming

majority of the courses at Saint Joseph College, something
like 70 percent of the courses,
1 acknowledge that it may be possible to draw
a line and I am frankly at a loss as to where to draw them.
Perhaps one can say that your particular biology class,
Mr, Justice Stewart, should not receive the aid, or perhaps
the biology department should not receive the aid or
perhaps the department of physic»? sciences should not
receive the aid.
I frankly don't know where to draw the line.

The

litmus paper test which I think makes it easier as to where
to draw the line is simoly to avoid prayer.

I would

point out
QUESTION:

Well, what if in a chemistry class at

Harvard the professor, a very able chemist, also happened to
be a very strong atheist and put into his class each day a
couple of minutes of his views propagandizing atheeim?
Would that make Harvard .ineligible as a recipient of public
funds?
MR, GP.BSNWALD:

Well, I would say that is

different.
QUESTION s

HOW?

And why?

24
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Constitutionally.

MR. GREENWALDs
QUESTION:

Than prayer.

Pardon me?

How and why constitutionally is it

different?
MR. GREENWALD:

Because prayer by its very nature

is religious?
QUESTION:
of this Court.

So is atheism by — under the decisions

It is equally protested constitutionally.

MP. GREENWALD:

I understand, it is protected

constitutionally but I don3t think it rises to the same
degree of prayer.
QUESTION:

Prayer * by its —
Do you think that tar funds could be

used to support a canter of atheistic teaching without
violating the establishment clause?
MR. GREENWALD;

I think that under certain

circumstances tax funds could be no used if it were clear,
as in Tilton, for example, the party stipulated that the
teaching of atheism was strictly academic.

That, arguably,

would b@ a secular educational function of the institute
and under this Court’s decisions could be supported by
fcas£ aid.
QUESTION:

Well, you are making a. distinction

then, I take it, between teaching atheism, advocating it
and teaching about it.

25
MR. GREENWALD;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Is that where you draw the line?

MR. GREENWALD:
making that distinction.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am
X would just like to offer that

this Court in Tilton had as one of its touchstone® th©
absence of religious worship which I assume includes
prayers in classrooms from the types of facilities which
were there permitted.
I'd like to turn now, if I may —
QUESTION:

Th© Court went beyond that a little,

didn't it, by cutting off the 20-year limitation?
MR. GSSENWALD;
QUESTION;

That is correct.

So that la effect it could not convert

it into a chapel at the end of 20 years, a® the original
grant conceivably would have permitted.
MR. GREENWALD:

That is correct.

It did strike

Facilities Act in Tilton.
QUESTION;
your argument, would-

Mr. Graenwaid, before you go back to
you tell, us the other two litmus tests

of the sectarian institution?
and what were the other two?

One is prayer in the class
It should be shown by this

record.
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes, sir.

Another, I submit, is

the recruitment of faculty based upon religion.

This, too,

26

I submit, strikes at the heart of this Court’s premise
for allowing public aid to church-related schools which is
that the sectilar functions and the religious functions are
separable.
When you recruit or even have a policy to recruit
faculty based on religion, it seems to me that you neces,
sarily strike at the heart of that premise, even though
the policy is partial, even though there are exceptions
and it does not extend to the entire faculty recruitment
practices at the

school.

The third litmus paper test, Mr. Justice Stevens,
relates to the granting of scholarships.

I would say that

where an institution such as the College of Notre Dame in
this case bases scholarships at least in part upon
religion, that, too, strikes at the heart of this Court's
premise that the religious functions of an institution and
the academic functions are severable.
The fact is that the College of Notre Dame here
automatically awards scholarships to teachers of Catholic
parochial schools and to members of the school, Sisters of
Notre Dame, which is the sponsoring religious order.
I‘d like to, if I may, focus upon one or two
critical points of the Appellants’ case here.

It first

relates to nature of the aid.
The lower court specifically held that the

27
difference between so-called general purpose grants,

as

are involved in this case, and special purpose grants, as
were involved in Tilton versus Richardson, are constitu­
tionally insignificant.
I would only point out that no prior case
decided by this Court involved aid in such a broad form
as is offered by the State of Maryland.

In fact, even the

aid which this Court has struck down is far more limited
by its very nature than that aid permitted by the State of
Maryland.
The basic distinction offered by this Court is that
secular, neutral or non-ideological services, facilities
and supplies may, under certain circumstances, be per­
missible .
However, aid which, at least potentially, involves
the fostering, the danger of fostering religion, is not.
The distinction at bottom is between aid which is
atmospherically indifferent on the score of religion — in
Professor Freund's words — from aid which potentially
fosters religion.
The Maryland aid, insofar as it may extend to
virtually anything under the sun short of so-called
to
"sectarian purposes"/which the school wants to use the aid,
is necessarily too broad.
Nov/, the resulting relationship is the third prong

28

of the entanalement analysis, the excessive entanglement
analysis.
Basically, the teaching by this Court is that
guarantees which are comprehensive and continuing will
create an aura of excessive entanglement and so in this
case, contrary to Tilton versus Richardson, you have
annual appropriations and annual payments of the state to
the church-related institution.
Contrary to Tilton versus Richardson, you have at
least two reports, the pre-expenditure report and the post­
expenditure report, submitted by the school to the churchrelated institution.
Contrary to Tilton, the state analyzes each of
these reports each year to determine whether or not the
expenditure was religious or secular.
Contrary to Tilton, the

schools here have their

expenditures subjected to annual audit.
Contrary -QUESTION:

Mr. Greenwald, would you agree —-or

do you know whether in Maryland the annual reports of
church-related schools are analyzed to see if tliey are

MR. GREENWALD:

Well —

29

QUESTION:

For all private schools?

MR. GREENWALD:

Information is furnished to the

Maryland Council of Higher Education dealing with that
sort of thing.

I don’t know if it specifically deals with

the proper amount of reading, writing and arithmetic but —
QUESTION:

Well, does Maryland have a certain

minimum requirement as to what a private school must do to
be a surrogate for the public school system?
MR. GREENWALD:

In order to become accredited,

yes, sir, they do and —
QUESTION:

Well, some must, at least, try to

determine whether they are teaching children to read.
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, from the reports I read

about Maryland schools, I am not so sure that they do but
there are at least minimal standards which are observed by
the state through the collection of information from these
church-related institutions.
QUESTION:

So the fact that there is a surveillance

standing alone is not dispositive of these issues, is it?
MR. GREENWALD:

No, not at all, but it is the

degree of surveillance, your Honor, which, I submit,- is
dispositive of these issues.
The surveillance here, I submit, involves
precisely those kinds of surveillance struck down in
Lemon versus Kurtzman and those kinds of surveillance upon

30
which the Court in Tilton distinguished Lemon versus
Kurzman.
In Tilton you have a one-time, single-purpose
construction grant.

This was an important cornerstone of

the Court's decision.

Here, under the Maryland aid, you

have no such thing and that is what creates excessive
entanglement.
QUESTION:

What exactly is the form of audit

that is performed? ■ Doss this involve simply examining the
reports of the expenditures to see if, as reported, it
reflected on the books or does it require some kind of
surveillance at the institution itself by how many people
and that sort of thing?
MR. GREENWALD:

That is undefined, your Honor,

both in the statute and —
QUESTION:

But do we know anything?

Does the

record show what the practice has been?
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, there has been no practice

There was, however, testimony — and the lower

court found that the audits would be quick and nonjudgmental.
QUESTION:

What does that mean?

MR. GREENWALD:

Well, that is a good question.

I submit that if an audit is non-judgmental it can’t very
well be very much good to enable the state to enforce its

31
QUESTION:

Now, what is the state organization

that perforins the audit?
MR„ GREENWALD:

Nell, it performs at the behest

of the Maryland Council of Higher Education, which, I
believe, contacts the state auditors office to perform
that function,
QUESTION:

Well, is there an organization of

so many people charged with the responsibility of per­
forming these audits?
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, I don't know the answer.

I don’t know specifically how many people would perform
that.

I do know that an analysis of sectarian as opposed

to secular use would be made perpetually by the Council
of Higher Education for the State of Maryland.

QUESTION:

Well, is it fundamentally any

different from the processes of surveillance for
accreditation?
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes, I think it is significantly

different, your Honor, because here under this aid
program, the state expressly analyzes religious use of
aid funds as opposed to secular use and this is a rather
involved sort of analysis.

It is a continuing sort of

v

analysis, both of which are diametrically opposed to the
type of analyses which were required in Tilton versus
Richardson.

32
QUESTION:

And you suggest that in and of itself

that constitutes impermissible entanglement?
/

MR. GREENWALD:

No, sir.

Again, entanglement

is really an equation with three variables.

I am

contending that the cumulative effect of one, the character
and purposes of the institution, two, the broad, broadest
possible nature of the aid here,

and three, the prophylac­

tic measures which have to be taken in order to enforce
the ban against sectarian use, together, cumulatively.

QUESTION:

I think you suggested earlier that

there has to be an annual legislative appropriation?

Does the record tell us whether there

it in those terms.

However, the regulations which are

applicable to both church-related and non-church-related
schools provide for necessary follow-up including audit
so I wou,ld say, an audit could be applied to these other
schools.
QUESTION:

It could be, or does the regulation

HR. GREENWALD:

The regulations don't mandate

In Tilton versus Richardson, this Court, for the

first time, permitted payment of direct aid to churchrelated institutions.

It did so under expressed narrow

constraints and later cases have upheld the narrowness of
these constraints.
Appellants would urge the Court not to effectively
abandon these restraints because to do so would breach
Jefferson's wall of separation and we submit would be an
t

unconstitutional establishment of religion.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE A NILSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. NILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
t

On behalf of the State of Maryland, I will speak
to the history, the nature and the importance of the
Maryland aid program at issue in this case.
In doing so, I will necessarily deal with the
primary effect element of the establishment clause as well
as the counterweight part of that test, the requirement

35

that the state avoid excessive entanglement

with religion.

I will not be dealing in any depth with the
particular details of the Tilton-type colleges involved in
$
this case, but will leave that to fir. Connolly, who
represents all of the Appellee colleges here.
He will use the remaining thirty minutes of our
time to discuss in depth the nature and character of these
colleges and ..the importance of that character to the
issues presented and to speak in further detail to the
primary effect and entanglement issues.
The State of Maryland does not have a program
of aid to private elementary and secondary schools.

The

grant program at issue here, as Mr. Greenwald has pointed
out, involves aid to institutions of higher learning.
i

QUESTION:

Do you think there is a fundamental

difference at those levels?
MR. WILSON:

I think there is at least a

difference in the way church-related institutions that
operate at those levels have dealt with the education of
students in the two different environments and the way
that that has evolved.

1 think there is also a significant

t

difference wholly apart from the way the institutions have
approached it because of the age and the maturity and the
intellectual freedom, the sense of academic freedom on the
P5rt of,the student bodies that I think makes the two

36

backgrounds and the two settings substantially ditferent
and I think that was explicitly recognized in this Court’s
plurality opinion in Tilton and later in the opinion in
Hunt.
------

/

In Maryland, less than one-third of the insti­
tutions receiving aid under the program are church-related
/
and have been found by the lower courts to conform closely
to the colleges considered by this Court in Tilton versus
Richardson.
The original version of our statute was passed
by the state legislature in early 1971 in obvious response
to the growing financial needs of private colleges and
un i ve r s i t i e s .
In establishing a grant program that, was not
limited to one particular type of aid, such as capital
grants for bricks and mortar but rather, permitted
flexibility, the state was codifying and funding a sound
educational policy that remains extremely important to
the state as well as the colleges today, a policy which
recognizes the different institutions have different
financial needs from year to year and that the state should
respond to those needs as they evolve rather than locking
all colleges in. to a particular type of aid which may be
artificially and unsoundly applied to satisfy contrived
/

rather than real needs.

37

,

Shortly following the original enactment of

Maryland's program in 1971, this Court decided Tilton v.
Richardson, upholding the Federal Capital Facilities Grant
Program there at issue but holding that any funds paid to
t

such colleges were constitutionally required to

be paid

subject to an explicit and permanent prohibition against
sectarian useage.
Maryland responded immediately by amending its
t

statute to include such provisions and by conferring
certain responsibilities and powers in connection with the
administration of our program upon the Maryland Council for
Higher Education, a body already charged with substantial
responsibilities and information-gathering functions in the
field of higher education.
As Mr. Greenwald has mentioned in his argument,
/

the Establishment Clause in cases such as this breaks down
into a three-part test:
The secular legislative purpose served by the
statute (about which there is no question.
The primary effect test.
And, thirdly, the requirement that, the government
avoid excessive entanglement with religion.
There is an inevitable tension between the primary
effect and the excessive entanglement restrictions, a tension
of which, we submit, the state and the Maryland Council are

38

very much aware.
In essence, it is necessary for the state to avoid
the payment of aid to a sectarian institution or to assist
a specifically-religidus activity in an otherwise secular
t

setting, to use the words of this Court in Hunt and to do
so without involving itself in an excessively entangling
relationship with religion.
Where a school is pervasively sectarian, as has
generally been the case with the primary and secondary
schools which have been before the Court, a guarantee of
no advancement of religion is required and almost invariably,
the difficulty of separating the secular from the sectarian
both makes it impossible to avoid aiding religion and
requires a quantum of oversight which is necessarily
excessively entangling.

•

4

But where an institution

such as the institutions

involved in this case are not pervasively sectarian and
are generally characterized by strong elements of academic
freedom/and discipline rather than religious indoctrination,
limited sectarian activities can be separated from the
dominant secular element and the problems of avoiding aid
to the sectarian part are greatly simplified.
*

This, I would submit, is far more likely to occur
at the college level.
QUESTION:

How do you make that separation with

33
respect<to funds which go into the general receipts of the
college and may be used for the payroll, salaries of
teachers?
MR. NTLSON:

For the payroll of teachers, the

s

Maryland Council presently requires that any institution
which uses funds for salaries identify the area of the
institution in. which those faculty members are working.
Following the district court opinion below

and

I might add that this has been applied not only with
respect to these institutions but also with respect to
all colleges throughout Maryland, no payments are permitted
towards'the salary of any faculty member who is in a
religion or theology department.
If an institution is using state funds to pay
teachers in its home economics department, that, as far as
/
the Maryland Council is concerned, is perfectly permissible.,
But it would not be permissible for the institution to use
funds for a teacher in the religion department.
,

QUESTION:

How many of the faculty members are

clerics who are being paid directly by state funds?
MR. NILSON:

In terms of percentages of faculty

members at these particular institutions who are

clerics,

t

the percentages, vary.

To my knowledge, and I put aside the

first year of the program because as I indicated, during
the first year of the program
1 f there v.as no sectarian

40

useage prohibition.

t

V

Those of the church-related Appellee institutions,
to my knowledge, have never -- and this is not in the record
because there had

been no actual experience under the

current 'program but none of the Appellee institutions have
ever used state monies to pay other than lay faculty is
my understanding.
QUESTION:

Does the record in this case — has any

4

examination been made as to whether or not any money has
been paid to clerics or not?
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:

Mr. Justice Marshall —
Or is there just a blank in the records?
— I have to again reiterate that

the posture in which this-case was tried below, the statute
had operated for a one-year period of time.
When it did not have a sectarian useage prohibition
and the Maryland Council had not been given responsibility,
the statute was significantly changed at the end of that oneyear period.
4

This lawsuit was filed at the time that statutory
change was pending, very shortly before it had been enacted
by the General Assembly.

When the lawsuit was filed, the

state voluntarily determined to escrow all funds that were
being awarded to these Appellee colleges and those funds
were held in escrow pending the outcome of this case before

41
the district court.
As a consequence, at the time of the trial below,
no money had been paid by the State of Maryland under this
aid program to, as far as the record is concerned, any
church-related college and certainly not to any of these
*
colleges so that the record is simply silent on that
question.
QUESTION:

Well, is there anything in the order of

the district court that would prevent all of this money
going to clerics?
MR. NILSON:

There is nothing to prevent all of

this money going to clerics, but there is certainly some4

thing in the district court's opinion which is being
followed by the state which would prevent this money from
going to pay the salary of faculty members teaching in the
religiox) and theology departments and that prohibition is an
explicit part of the regulations which the council has
since adopted
QUESTION:

If the entire faculty of the school of

business administration, if there is such a thing for clerics,
these monies, so far as the

order of the lower court is

concerned, could be used to pay their salaries , couldn't
they?
*

MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

That is absolutely correct.

But I --

That now would be restrained by the

42
statute.
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
That now would be subject, to the

restraint of the statute.
MR. NILSON:

No, it would not be subject to the

restraint of the statute, if — certainly, based on the
findings of the lower court, which is that these courses
not
are/predominantly sectarian, are basically academic
institutions, that there is nothing to indicate that courses
anywhere outside of the religion or theology departments
are taught in other than a purely academic fashion, I don't,
perceive that there would be any constitutional prohibition
4

against the state paying the salary of a faculty member who
happened to be teaching in the school of business adminis­
tration.
As a practical matter, I can tell you that I don't
believe the applications have been made but as far as I am
concerned, that person is first and foremost, based on the
findings of the District Court, a. teacher, a faculty member
who is teaching a subject in an academic manner.
QUESTION:

You have told us, though, that none

of these funds go to pay any part of the salary of any
teacher who is also a member of the clergy.
4

MR. NILSON:

Now, Mr. Chief Justice, what I said

was that to my knowledge, no funds have been devoted to

43
that purpose.

I don't believe that any applications -- and

this is because the applications which have come in since
the trial in this case -QUESTION:

Yes, but so far as the lower court

order is concerned, as I understand you, except to the
extent that there is a prohibition against paying the salaries
of anyone teaching in the school of theology, any cleric
teaching in the school of business administration or medical
school dr anything else could be paid with these funds.
Isn't that right?
MR. WILSON:

That is correct, as far as the lower

court's order is concerned.
4

QUESTION:

Then could he be paid for holding

prayers?
MR, NILSON:

Well,

he wouldn't be paid for

holding-prayers, Mr. Justice Marshall.

He would be paid

for teaching.
QUESTION:

What if a clergyman runs for Congress.

Do you think there is anything to prevent the Treasury from
t

paying his salary as a Congressman?
MR. NILSON:

Well, I can think of at least one

Congressman who might be very disturbed at the present
time if that were the case and I know that, for example,
the State of Maryland has a provision in its Constitution
which goes back many years which prohibited any minister or

44
clergyman from running and that provision was recently
stricken down by the district court of Maryland as violating
the Constitution.
And I think the answer is that absolutely, if a
clergyman runs for Congress, that his salary can be paid,
the same as any other Congressman.
QUESTION:

Am I stating this correctly, as to

what this law and the district court judgment permits and
authorizes.

Let’s assume that every single teacher in all

of these institutions in courses in theology and religion is,
in fact, a lay person.

Nonetheless, the lav/ as construed by

the district court does not permit the public subsidy of
their salaries.

Is that correct?

MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
No matter if they are all lay people

and on the other hand, let's assume that all of the faculty
in all of the other areas and courses in these institutions,
mathematics, biology, zoology, astronomy, home economics,
foreign languages and English and history and the rest of
*
it, are all clergymen or clergywomen.
This law and the court’s decree permits public
taxpayer subsidies of all their salaries, does it not?
,

MR. NILSON:

That is correct so long a:3 none of

them are serving — and this I am reading from the
regulations --- "serve as a chaplain or director of the

45
campus ministry or administers or supervises any program of
religious activities."
QUESTION:
MR. WILSON:

Right.
Right.

Well, that's -- yes.
If they are there teaching

in the science department and they happen to be clerics,
there is nothing in the district court's opinion that would
t

specifically

prohibit their salaries being paid.

QUESTION:. Yes, that was my understanding.

Now, a number of questions were asked earlier
during Mr. Greenwald's presentation on the'way in which the
i

program is administered and I'd like to just, touch briefly
on that.
As Mr. Greenwald pointed out, following initial
eligibility determinations -- and I might add that there
have been some institutions disqualified on a degree basis
otherwise for being primarily religious.
There is a pre and post expenditure affidavit
requirement.

These are filed under oath by the chief

executive officer of the institution and I submit do not

48

involve the state in any excessive entanglements»
The council has large amounts of detail available
to it from its other duties and the process of analyzing and
scrutinizing these reports is not entangling.,
The audits are not annual audits.

As far as the

record is concerned they have never been performed.
lower court found that they are quick.

The

They can be done

speedily, given the kind of fund accounting system that
is set up.
QUESTION:

Exactly what are they?

Exactly what

form do the audits take?
MR. NILSON:

Well, the audits would only come into

play if the state had reason to believe that a particular
item may not have been spent for what it was described as
being spent for.
QUESTION:

As reported.

MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

As reported.
I see.

MR. NILSON:

What they would do first, and the

testimony indicates, is that they might call upon the
institution to have its own auditor provide a report.
If the state

still wasn't satisfied then, and

only then might they send a state auditor out to the
institution.
QUESTION:

And what would he do if he went to

49
the institution.
MR. NILSON:

He would go out and he would analyze

the special revenue fund account which is required by the
regulations.
QUESTION:

In other words, just the financial

r ecords.
MR. NILSON:

That is correct.

He wouldn’t go in the classrooms or —

That, we

of course, as your Honor indicated by the questions to
Mr. Greenwald, we do have a certification and accreditation
system.

We do have periodic reviews of these institutions

generally in other areas.

That could be done.

The council is very much aware on-a continuing
basis of the nature of these institions and would be

aware

of any change in emphasis.
•

QUESTION:

Well, then, you are telling us that

Maryland does have a surveillance of primary and secondary
schools to see whether they are teaching them a minimum
number of hours of reading, writing and arithmetic, et
cetera.

50

MR. NILSON:

That is correct and we have to be

kept aware of what is going on with the private colleges
all the time because we have to plan for our public colleges
so this information is available to us.
Again, before yielding to Mr. Connolly, I would
like to reiterate that the state is attempting to administer
a reasonable and realistic program.

It has demonstrated

sensitivity to the First .Amendment issues in its day-to-day
administration of the program in the adoption of the ’72
amendment and in the adoption of the regulations„
We urge this Court to let the state continue to
give money to these colleges and others.

of Baltimore, Mount Saint Mary's College of Emmitsburg,
Maryland, Notre Dame of Maryland, which is predominantly a
women's college in Baltimore.
If it please the Court, I think that the Plaintiffs
case here has two main failures.

One, his entire brief

and largely his argument this morning except in response to
questions of Mr. Justice Blackraun failed to distinguish
between the type of school systems who are the beneficiaries
of state aid.
This Court, in the last, five years, has written
opinions in eight cases with respect to governmental attempts

52
to provide aid to private school systems.

In six of those

cases, it has found aid in all its forms impermissible.
Every one of those cases showed as a fact that the
beneficiaries of that aid were large parochial school
systems which the discrict court in DiCenso

found to be an

integral part of the religious mission of the Catholic
church and in Nyguist found that they practiced restrictions
on admissions, restrictions on faculty hiring, that they
were under the control of the governing bishop of the
community.
These colleges are not.
schools.

These are independent

They respond to no ecclesiastical authority.

The

evidence is clear with respect to this.
The second thing that the plaintiffs in this case
do, is they largely ignore the very detailed findings of
fact which ware made in the district court.
This was not a case that comes to this Court on
an abbreviated record.

The plaintiffs used the full

panoply of the discovery .powers of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.
Hearings were conducted over a sixs-weeks period
of time.

Over 2,000 pages of testimony were taken.

findings of fact were submitted.

Proposed

The district judge assigned

to gather the facts published tentative findings of fact,
heard arguments again, then made findings of fact which v?ere

53
adopted by the three-judge court including the dissenter.
So we have had plenty of due process insofar as
fact-finding is concerned and if Rule 52 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure have any meaning, I think it should
mean that these findings should be respected on appeal unless
found to be clearly erroneous and I think there has been no
attempt to do that before this Court or in the briefs and,
as fir. Justice Rrennan pointed out and Mr. Creenv/nld agreed
with it,

there was an obliaation on the part of the Plaintiffs

to carry their burden of proof.
I think it is instructive if we remember that tnis
Court's plurality opinion, which I think has become the
majority opinion in Hunt, developed several criteria for
testing whether or not tile schools which were the beneficiarie
of tiie federal aid program in Tilton were pervasively
sectarian or had a predominant secular mission.
And these, gentlemen, are the findings of the
district court with respect to these colleges:
One, not only has there been no showing that
religion slants the conduct of classes at the Defendants'
/

institutions, this litigation has demonstrated the opposite
to be true.
Two, none of these facts respecting prayer impairs
the clea,r and convincing evidence that courses at each
defendant institution are taught according to the academic

requirements intrinsic to the subject matter and the
individual teacher's concepts of professional standards.
Three, there was"potent evidence,"

the Court’s

words, "of academic secularity" in the uncontroverted
testimony of numerous members of the faculty of each
defendant.

They feel no religious pressures by anyone on

their classroom presentation or their selection of texts
and course materials.
Each defendant subscribes to the 1940 statement
of principles on academic freedom of the American Association
of University professors and each, obviously abides by it.
Four, while the district court did not make any
finding as to the student attitude, there was no evidence
to contradict the Tilton observation about the maturity and
skepticism of the average college student.
Indeed, there was much testimony to support it.
One of the professors of theology said, "The kind of
questions, if you want to meet unbelievers, come and talk to my students."
Five, the Court said, "Thorough analysis of the
student admission and recruiting criteria of each" defendant
demonstrates that the student bodies are chosen without
reaard to religion."

On the scholarship point, Mr. Connolly,

policy of giving the Roman Catholics —
MR. CONNOLLY:
QUESTION:

Is that true or false?

MR. CONNOLLY:
true.

Yes, your Honor.

Well, so far as it goes, it is

Let me tell you about that.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. CONNOLLY:

First of all, it is our position

that state funds cannot be used for scholarships that fund --§
scholarships that are awarded on a religious bias.

What the

evidence shows is that postulants of the teaching order
and parochial school teachers are permitted to attend Notre
Dame at a reduced rate.

It is not an absolute scholarship,

it is a tuition-forgiveness program.

56
Obviously, since that is a test that you be a
parochial school teacher or you be a member of the sponsoring
religious group, these state funds should not be used for
that purpose and there is no evidence that that ever took
place.

The only school that ever gave scholarships was not

Notre Dame of Maryland but was Loyola College and there is
some confusion in the Plaintiffs' brief.

If you read it

too quickly, you think that the scholarship program is the
scholarship program that favored members of the religious
grouns.

That is not so.
Again, the district court said, "At no defendant

was there such cominance on the faculty by one religious
group that hiring bias would escape the attention of members
of other religious groups.

The faculty members impressed

tile Court as professionals who

value academic freedom and

see no place for religious bias in liberal arts education."
If there were an effort to stack its faculty with
members of a particular religious group, it could not have
escaped the attention of the present faculty, who would have
made complaint to the local chapter of the Association of
University Professors.
Questions were asked this morning about the
composition of the faculty.

We cannot tell with respect to

Mount Saint Mary's because Mount Saint Mary's keeps absolutely
.no records whatsoever that would identify the religion of

57
its faculty members.
Loyola faculty, of its full-time faculty,60 percent
are Catholic.

Of its part-time faculty, 50 percent are

Catholic and the overall faculty average is 56 percent.

It

is in the same range, although I am not as familiar with
the finures as respect to the other college, Notre Dane.
The Court continued, "The district court, with
t

respect to these collenes, no aspect of the student conduct
code at any defendant institution has any religious contents.
None of the defendants require attendance at any religious
exercise."
Finally,"at none of the defendants is religious
indoctrination a substantial purpose or activity.

While

each maintains a chaplaincy program that serves to encourage
spiritual development of the student — which is admittedly
a secondary objective of each defendant -- in none does this
encouragement go beyond providing the opportunities or
occasions for religious experience," a most important
observation by the district court.
Because the Plaintiff's brief in this case is
larded with references that the secondary objective of these
schools is to provide religious encouragement and development
to these students.
My friend neglects to add the qualifying language
made by the district court, namely, that in no instance does

58

this go beyond making religious services available to the
students at their willingness to attend.
Only in one respect, if the

Court please, do the

district court findings in this case depart from Tilton and
that is with respect to the teaching of theology and
religion.

In the Tilton case, there was a stipulation which

I think will be impossible to obtain in the future because
of the prominence that the observation was given in the
Court's opinion.
the
There was a stipulation that/theology courses
at the four Connecticut colleges were taught as an academic
discipline and not with the purpose of inculcating
religious values.

No such stipulation was obtained here.

Extensive evidence was taken with respect to it.
The district court said that it was unable to
determine how theology was taught.
based on two factors.

That determination was

He said he did not think it was

legally permissible for him to make such a. determination,
perhaps referring to this Court's prior opinion in UnitedStates versus Ballard where this Court should not interfere
v’xth the theological views that are being expressed within
various religious bodies.
He said he was also generally unable to make that
de te rrnin ation.
for whatever reason we don't know but we — why.

59
he avoided making that finding.
finding that he was not making

Clearly, he made a specific
a

finding that it was

taught in a sectarian manner.
But having, as many district judges do have, an
ability to accommodate their judgment to the practical
necessities of the time, this Court — the fact-finding
judge recommended and the three-judge court ordered that
theology and religion courses be carved out of the state
program.
In other words, it sustained the constitutionality
of the state program providing that no funds were used to
support the department of religion and theology.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Greenwald had a
coloquy this morning about how theology can be taught
academically.

It may be a difficult question.

We don't

agree with the; district court's finding in this respect but
we can live with it.

It certainly is a nice accommodation to

the entanglement point.

It obviates the necessity for any

class monitors sitting in a class of religion or theology
if you cut theology and the religion program out of the
course, as was done in this instance.
The district court found, as a conclusory fact,
that religious indoctrination is not a purpose of these
institutions.

Although each school has, as a secondary-

purpose, the encouragement of the spiritual development of

the students, at none of these schools does this encouragement
go beyond providing opportunity for religious experience.
The religious programs at each school are
separable from the secular programs and the latter are the
only beneficiaries of state aid.
That led the district court immediately to the
next point of the opinion, namely, the question of entangle­
ment .
QUESTION:

Before you get to that, Mr. Connolly,

are you suggesting by your discussion of these findings
and conclusions that were drawn from them that the secondary
purpose of the colleges here is essentially the same or
nearly the same as the service academies of the United
States' Government, West Point, Annapolis and the others
providing a chapel and chaplains?
MR. CONNOLLY:

I certainly do, your Honor and I

would hope that most of the private colleges of this country
also have as a secondary objective improving the spiritual
development of the students who attend those schools.

The

question, of course, is whether it is done in an indoc­
trinating way, whether these institutions become pervasively
religious, nothing but teaching arms of a church.

district court — excuse me -QUESTION:

take that burden at the monent.
QUESTION:

Does the record show how large the

total budget of these schools is?

To get about $100,000 a

year from Maryland, I gather.
MR. CONNOLLY:

No, your Honor, but we have a key.

The formula, you see, for payment to these schools is 1$
percent of what it costs the State of Maryland to keep a
full-time attendee at a public school so perhaps the
private colleges can be operated a little more cheaply than
the state schools but that gives you at least a guide at

63

any rate.
I was arriving at the entanglement point.

By

virtue of those findings, the district court said, "Because
of the nature of the recipient schools there is no necessity
for state officials to investigate the conduct of particular
classes or educational programs to determine whether a
school is attempting to indoctrinate its students under the
guise of secular education."
Now, that, I think, is quite obvious because, you
see, one of the reasons I think the Plaintiffs have so
assiduously avoided talking about the college system against
the parochial school system is, again, the language of the
district court which

said, "What would be impermissible in

an institution staffed by members of a particular faith
administratively controlled by a religious body and dedicated
to the inculcation of particular faith may

well be

permissible in an autonomous institution staffed by faculty
hired on the basis of academic merit where academic freedom
prevails and where courses are taught in accordance with
the requirements of an academic discipline."
It is our submission, if the Court please, that
despite the articulation by this Court of the three-part
test to determine whether or not governmental aid programs
may include among their beneficiaries church-related
schools that all of them really reduce themselves to a single

64

one, whac is the basic nature of the institution involved?
Obviously, as the questioning brought out this
morning, there is a rather extensive relationship between
state and schools, not only in the State of Maryland but,
indeed, in every state.

Each of these schools must pass

accreditation procedures, both for the state and by other
quasi-governmental bodies.
Indeed, the record shows in this very case that,
in alluding to the prayer issue, that Saint Josephs College
was actually monitored for its religious content by a state
accreditation agency.

It wanted to see whether the nursing

school there was sufficiently professional to merit
accreditation and they sat in the class and noticed no
religious content in the subject matter that was taught.
At any rate, there is an extensive relationship
that just goes on all the time between educational
institutions and the state agencies.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this if
these institutions are educational and not religious.
As we read this Court's prior opinion, the
excessive entanglement test is not to be applied just because
an institution has some church connection.

It is an inter­

ference with the religious aspects of a church-related
institution.
All of us are

obviously familiar with the

65

extensive use of Hill-Burton funds that go to the nation's
hospitals, many of which are run by sectarian — are
sectarian in nature.
There is an ongoing relationship between state
health authorities, state certifying authorities in that
institution.

It is not that the state has a contact with

a religious institution, it is whether the state has a
contact with a religious aspect of that institution and as
long as you have institutions as these are, which are
found to be secular, which are found to have a religious
dichotomy to them where the religious aspects are separable
and can be perceived to be separate, then the fact that
the state has some oversight with respect to them is not
entanglement.

Likewise, when we —

QUESTION:

Mr. Connolly, can I ask you another

question?
MR. CONNOLLY:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Is there any danger in a program like

this that the university or the college will curtail its
religious activity in order to be sure it is eligible for
\

the state donation?
MR. CONNOLLY:

I think not and I think if your

Honor would read the testimony of the administrators and
the faculty members at this school, you will see that they
were churchmen and proud of it and they didn’t attempt

66

at all to modify their positions.
And they made it very clear chat whatever the
perception was in the past, that no longer is there attempt
to inculcate,religious values in the academic aspects here.
QUESTION:

Well, but that cuts the other way in

answer to my question.

If they are avoiding inculcating

religious values in order to qualify for the funds, isn’t
that perhaps —
MR. CONNOLLY:

I think --no, I think you will

find no inhibitions in this at all.

the Court’s attention

1 cannot imagine trustees entering that kind

67

of a stipulation, but they did.

They turned over the

administration of the school to the Plaintiffs and that is
unfortunate.

But they did it.

But that is not a necessity,

especially as long as this Court sits and can look at the
record that was made in this Court and apply the'principles
that we say have already been articulated .in the two cases.
When we come to the question of primary effect,
again we see that the real test is the nature of the
institution.

Aid really is of two kinds.

Some aid is

frankly religious, a chapel, a chaplaincy program, religious
books and tracts, these schools cannot use state money for
that, but neither can Johns Hopkins or Hood or Washington
College or the other schools.
They must account to the state and show the state
that they are not using it for that purpose.
Other aid, however, becomes religious or assumes
a religious coloration only by virtue of the environment
in which it is placed and then when we look at the
environment, if we see the environment is a predominantly
secular one for the inculcation of religious values, it is
not the purpose of the institution, then, it seems to me,
that the aid then becomes neutral.
QUESTION:

My —

Mr. Connolly, did the plaintiff or did

anyone in this case undertake to put anything in the record
by way of either a contest or comparison with institutions

68

like American University which is frankly and openly
sponsored by the Methodist Church but* from all I am aware
of, is not the kind of religious institution as to which
public money grants are barred.

Is there anything put in

the record to make these comparisons?
MR. CONNOLLY:

There was a Dr. McGill, who was

called as a witness by the Defend ants, who is an expert
educator.

He is one of the officers of the American

Association of Colleges who testified to the practice of
private colleges throughout the country in conducting
religious programs and conducting courses in religious
studies and theology.
Interestingly enough, we found that the better
class schools, if you wou3.d rate them on the Cass and
Beerembohm scale of selectivity, that there is an absolute
correlation, really, between the better schools and those
that have religious studies and theology programs in them
and he testified that the religious programs and the courses
in theology and religious studies that they are taught at
these schools did not. differ at all from those of the great
majority of American private colleges throughout the
country:
This is a program that has bit of genius in it.
Maryland has elected to give a general purpose grant program.
Of course, the grant is not general once it is

69

issued.

The school must make application for it, must tell

what it is for.
The chief executive officer must take an oath
that he will use it in that way and then after it is
received and expended he must take an oath that it was
used in that way,
