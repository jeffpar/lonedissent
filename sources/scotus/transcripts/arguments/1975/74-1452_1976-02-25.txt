MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74-1452, Hospital Building Company
against the Trustees of Rex Hospital.
Mr. Train, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN K. TRAIN, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TRAIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
The question of law presented here in this case is
whether a conspiracy between two business competitors to take
over and dominate a market, to the exclusion of the third
competitor, is actionable under the Sherman Act.
Specifically, whether the traditional interstate
commerce tests for Sherman Act jurisdiction are met by the
allegations of the complaint.
The business in question is the delivery of hospital
services.

The geographical market in question is Wake County,

Raleigh, North Carolina.
Petitioner, Hospital Building Company, or HBC, owns
and operates Mary Elisabeth Hospital in Raleigh.
The named conspirators are, essentially, the two
competing hospitals in Raleigh:

Rex Hospital and Wake

Hospital, and various persons associated with or acting for
them.

4
The conspiracy alleged is that these two competitors
and the other conspirators, which have been referred to in our
brief as the Raleigh Group, have conspired to allocate the
market for hospital services in terms of customers and of
output in Raleigh, to fix prices for hospital services, and to
foreclose effective competition by HBC in that market»
This, we submit to the Court, is not second-rate
conspiracy, as the Fourth Circuit majority opinion appeared to
assume.
In order to accomplish the purposes of the conspiracy,
the Raleigh Group has undertaken, among other actions, to
prevent expansion through relocation and construction of an
entirely new facility by HBC from an old 49-bed hospital to a
new 149-bed hospital; a tripling of capacity and ability

to

compete»
QUESTION;

So it3s still a fairly small hospital?

As hospitals go.
MR. TRAIN:

Your Honor, there is — Your Honor, there

is no evidence in the record as to its size in'comparison with
other hospitals.

We have before us only the allegations of

the complaint, and the size of the market is not in the record,
may it please the Court.
The basic issue before this Court —
QUESTION:

I merely mention it because you say a

tripling in the number of beds.

If it had two and went to six,

5

it would still triple, but it would be pretty small.
MR. TRAIN:

Yes, that's -— I understand that, Your

Honor.
The basic issue before this Court is whether the
complaint alleges facts sufficient to meet either or both of
the two tests for jurisdiction under the Sherman Act:

the in­

commerce test and the affecting-commerce test.
The competition restrained by the conspiracy is real.
Hospitals, whether government-owned, non-profit, or proprietary
profit-making, such as HBC, compete to serve patients who pay
for treatment there, or for whom payment is made by third
parties.

This is what the complaint refers to as paid

hospital business.
Such competition is of the price and price equivalent
variety, such as lower rates and charges, the inclusion of
additional services in basic rates, and also of the non-price
variety:

more modern and pleasant facilities, larger staffs,

more extensive and moderan equipment.
Just as in other businesses, hospitals compete by
offering better services and facilities, lower prices, or both.
The provision of hospital services, the business of
operating a hospital, involves much more than placing a bed in
a building and hiring a staff.

The hospital business is not

just a local business.
Hospital services cannot be provided by HBC or by any

6

hospital without a continuing and substantial flow of drugs,
equipment and supplies»
QUESTION:

Mr» Train, let me ask you — perhaps the

record clearly discloses this — but this, your client is a
profit hospital, and for-profit hospital?
MR. TRAIN:

That5s correct, it's —

QUESTION:

Is it owned by a group of physicians at

MR. TRAIN:

Nc.

all?
The record shows that it is owned

by Charter Medical Corporation, which is a regional group or
chain, if you will, of hospitals and nursing homes located in
Macon, Georgia.
QUESTION;
MR, TRAIN:
QUESTION:
MR. TRAIN:

Is admission —
Excuse me.
— restricted to specified physicians?
Your Honor, again I emphasize, we're

dealing solely with the complaint since the case was dismissed
on a motion under 12(b) (6).

There is nothing in the record to

indicate that, but I’m sure it has staff rules and regulations
like so many of them do.
QUESTION: Well, you were speaking of the three
hospitals competing, and usually a profit hospxtal is restricted
in its admission policies to patients of those physicians who
own it.
MR. TRAIN: Well, Your Honor, ---

7
QUESTION;

I wondered whether your complaint shows

this.
MR. TRAIN;

Your Honor, physicians do not own this

hospital* this is owned by a profit-making corporation.

I do

not believe that the patients who are subject to admission to
a profit-making hospital are necessarily restricted to those
of the physicians who own it.

I believe — and again Isra talking

outside the record* because we don*t have a record — but I
believe they are — the limitation is that they must be
admitted by members of a staff there* and I believe that
typically the staff is v?ider than just those physicians who
might own it.
In any event* as I say* this hospital is not owned
by jhysicians * and there is no evidence of any restrictions on
admissions to this particular hospitali or* for that matter*
the other two hospitals in so far as this record shows.
Hospitals* of course* as we have stated* do not
exist in a vacuum* they have to purchase goods and supplies
just like any other business.
It is alleged in the complaint that a substantial
amount of IIBC’s purchases of these supplies are purchased from
out-of-State vendors. And* further* that 80 percent of the
supplies of HBC are. purchased pursuant to nationwide supply
contracts* which are negotiated by HBC's out-of-State parent
corporation* Charter Medical in Macon* Georgia.

8

A hospital# likewise, cannot function without
management and administration.,

HBC purchases and receives

management services from its out-of-State parent»

Hospital

services cannot be furnished unless they are paid for»

And

today that means receipts of payments from third-party payors#
both private insurance carriers and governmental programs»
Almost 95 percent of HBC’s billings are to thirdparty payors# and the source of such, payments in a substantial
number of cases is located outside the State of North Carolina.
In short# interstate commerce is at the heart of the
operation of any hospital# and# in particular# is at tine heart
of the operation of Mary Elizabeth by IIBC.
Drugs, supplies# equipment, and other goods are
purchased in interstate commerce as ingredients of the ultimate
product# hospital services# which is purchased by patients#
the cons urns rs.
In turn# bills are rendered to and payments received
from ont-of-State financial sources.

IIBC# as the operator of

the hospital and the furnisher of hospital services# is at the
center of and is an integral and essential connector between
these flows of goods and payments in interstate commerce.
In these circumstances, we submit that any conspiracy
to restrain competition by HBC in a limited market where there
are only three competitors, HBC being one# in the furnishing
of hospital services, is actionable in federal courts under

9

both the affects-commerce test and the in-commerce test*
for jurisdiction under -the Sherman Act»
---- ;

we will discuss first the affects-commarce test»
We respectfully submit that a conclusion adverse to

that of the Fourth Circuit is compelled by this Court's
consistent application of the

affects-commerce test to find

jurisdiction under the Sherman Act with respect to so-called
local conspiracies.
In such cases as South-Eastern Underwriters, Women *s
Sportswear and, most, recently, Goldf arb, this Court has made
clear that the designation of a particular business as local
or intra-state does not answer the question of whether or not
that business, or a conspiracy to restrain it, is subject to
the Sherman Act.
South-Eastern Underwriters in particular teaches us
that ‘the distinction between what has been called local and
what intra-state is a type of mechanical criterion which this
Court has not deemed controlling in the measurement of federal
power.
Notwithstanding this admonition, the Fourth Circuit
majority, like the District Court in the St. Bernard Parish
case cited in our brief, which was reversed by the Fifth
Circuit, dealing with this same issue, the Fourth Circuit was
mesmerized by its focus on the supposedly local nature of the
hospital business.

10
As already noted, this characterization is a mis­
conception. The essence of the hospital business is the inter­
state flow to, through, and from it, of goods, bills and
payments.
QUESTION:

Mr. Train, somewhere you'll comment on

the Oregon Medical Society case, as you go along -- you don't
have to do it now.
MR. TRAIN:

I'd be pleased to comment on that case

right now, Your Honor.

In the Supreme Court opinion, the

reference is to the few contacts with interstate commerce as
consisting of payments made from the Oregon Medical Society
association arrangement, the insurance for hospital payments
from Oregon to other States where patients covered by the
Oregon arrangements had gone to other States.

The Supreme

Court characterized those, I believe, as fortuitous and "sporadic
I believe was another word that the Supreme Court there used.
QUESTION:

Do you think times have changed in the

25 years since that case was decided?
MR. TRAIN;
that I think they have.

Well, I believe — I can state my place
I don’t believe that case is authority

in support of the Fourth Circuit's opinion here, since, as I
say, in that case the Supreme Court, in commenting on the
interstate commerce involvement, made it clear that it was not
substantial, it was not a substantial effect on interstate
commarce.

11
Here, and as opposed to sporadic and infrequent
payments across State lines, we allege a continuing flow of
s uch p ay men ts .
Now, I am referring, if Your Honor please, to the
Supreme Court opinion in that case, not to the District Court
opinion.
The question is not of characterization of something
as local or intrastate, the question is whether interstate
commerce is affected.

As Mr. Justice Jackson said in Women*s

Sportswear, if it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch,
it does not matter hew local the operation which applies the
squeeze.
QUESTION; Well, Mr. Justice Jackson wrote the
/

Oregon Medical Society decision too, didn't he?
MR. TRAIN:,

He did indeed. Your Honor.

And, as Isve

just said, I think that can be squarely rationalized with our
position here.
QUESTION; Well, why wouldn't you say in the Oregon
Medical Society case, if you're right, tht although there -admittedly there weren’t many interstate contacts, there were
some, and if interstate commerce feels the effect, it doesn’t
make any difference that the conspiracy charged is local?
MR. TRAIN;

Because our position is not. Your Honor,

that every conspiracy or every effect on interstate commerce
is actionable.

I think the cases have made it clear that the

12

effect must be what the cases deem substantial.

This Court

has measured that quantitatively, it's measured it qualitatively.
In the Oregon Medical Society case, I think we have a
case where, according to the opinion written by Hr. Justice
Jackson, there were just no substantial effects on interstate
commerce.
The Fourth Circuit’s majority opinion, may it please
the Court, states the effect on commerce test in the words
that have been used before by this Court and others.

But then

it reads it out of existence, as we see it, by engrafting upon
it three additional conditions, not previously deemed to be a
part of that test.
First, according to the Fourth Circuit majority
opinion, the aim or object of the conspiracy, whether it is,
quote, "directed at”, end quote, a supposedly local activity
is an element in determining the substantiality of the effect
on commerce.
Jurisdiction under the Sherman Act is not, we submit,
a function of intent, but rather a function of impact.

Intent

may be relevant in a limited sense to show the probable effect
of an act, but where the effect is clear, intent, we submit,
is not relevant to determine the substantiality of that effect
under the Sherman Act.
\

In addition, we respectfully submit to this Court
that the allegations of the complaint describe a conspiracy

13

directed not just at HBC, not just at an expansion of the
hospital, but at an entire market.

The goal of the conspirators

being to control and allocate all of the paid hospital business
in the Raleigh area.
This does not just keep HBC from competing, we
respectfully submit? it keeps every one from competing.

It

denies entry to all potential entrants.
Second, the Fourth Circuits majority ppinion finds
the complaint defective, for purposes of jurisdiction under
the Sherman Act, because there is no showing that oufc-of-Stafce
suppliers or payors will go out of business.
We submit that the question is whether there is an
effect on the flow of commerce, not whether there is an effect
on out-of-State links or originators of that flow.
In Goldfarb, for example, this Court rejected the
argument that there was no showing that purchasers were
discouraged, and no showing that somehow the out-of-State
lenders were affected anticompetitively by the conspiracy
there found to be actionable.
Finally, in seeking to verbalise a formula for
application of the Sherman Act, the Fourth Circuit majority
engrafted a monopoly power requirement on the essential
jurisdictional allegations.

Section 1 of "the Sherman Act, of

course, is designed to reach restraint prior to the development
of monopoly power.

14
This Court has naver required the existence of anti­
competitive power sufficient to drive a competitor out of
business before finding -the Sherman Act applicable, or, rather
Section 1 of the Sherman Act applicable.

Section 2, of course,

deals with monopolies.
Again, may it please the Court, even accepting the
Fourth Circuit®s provision of the true test here, the power
alleged on the part of the conspirators here, the power to
allocate the market among themselves, the power to fix prices,
and, crucially, the power to exclude HBC from the market
represents precisely the danger Congress sought to guard
against in its enactment of the Sherman Act.
Substantiality is a requirement which this Court has
found to be satisfied, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
It is certainly satisfied quantitatively if a not insubstantial
amount of interstate commerce is affected.
The quantitative standard,may it please the Court,
is satisfied in this case.

The conspiracy here has operated

to restrain a tripling in size of a business through its
relocation and reconstruction in a new facility.
And perhaps, Mr. Justice Blackmun, this gets to your
question as to the size or the quantity of what is involved
here.
In 1972, this business purchased approximately
$112,000 in supplies and equipment on a regular and continuing,

15

not, a

one-time basis, and a substantial amount of that was

purchased from out-of-State sources»
Such purchases, it is alleged in the complaint,, would
increase sufostantially after expansion.

HBC purchased $36 .000

worth of management services from its out-of-State parent.
That payment is based on a gross revenues formula, and, likewise
these purchases of management services would increase sub­
stantially upon expansion.
A substantial flow of capital, at least $4 million,
communications and services in interstate commerce, will
result in the relocation and the reconstruction in a new
facility of Mary Elizabeth.
Finally, revenues are received in substantial amounts
by HBC from out-of-State payment sources.
More patients would be served by a relocated and
expanded hospital, and thus more revenues received from outof-State payment sources.
The quantitative effects on interstate commerce here
are both present and potential, but equally as real in each case
The present effects lie in the immediate prevention
of an expansion of the flow of commerce.

The goods and

services which would have been purchased by an expanded and
relocated HBC, the capital andadditional revenues which would
have flowed to HBC from out-of-State.

The potential effect is

the terminal choking off of all activity if the conspiracy's

16
ultimate goal,, the exclusion of HBC from the market, is
achieved»
Perhaps' one of the problems we have had in articu­
lating the effect on commerce of the conspiracy is due to the
fact that the conspiracy has blocked an attempt to expand and
relocate and thus treble the capacity of HBC.

We are, therefore,

forced to talk about what might have been, and. we hope, what
will be in the future.
In these circumstances, the fact that this action
unquestionably falls within the line for Sherman Act juris­
diction that has been drawn by this Court is best demonstrated,
perhaps, by turning the situation around.
If this case alleged the existence of a 145-bed
hospital, and had the defendants combined and conspired to
eliminate that hospital as a competitor for hospital services
in the Raleigh area, and to reduce by two-thirds its ability
to do business, and if the reduction in HBC’s business resulted
then in a significant decrease, a measurable decrease in the
flow of goods, supplies, credit, reimbursements, and so on
from out-of-State to IIBC, then I think the lower courts would
have had less difficulty in seeing that the subs tanti ally affects
commerce test for application of the Sherman Act. had been met.
We submit that it’s clear that there is no
functional or legal difference for purposes of application of
the Sherman Act between a conspiracy which prevents expansion

17
and entry of business competitors and one which results in
contraction.
Therefore, the effect on interstate commerce being
both obvious and, we believe, substantial, the conspiracy
causing these effects is actionable under the Sherman Act.
The quantity or extent of the flow of interstate
commerce is not a Ions determinative as to whether there has
been a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

This Court

has observed just last term, in the Goldfarb case, that where
■there is an effect on interstate commerce, no specific
magnitude of the effect need be proven.
As we have discussed, the impact here is sufficiently
certain of measurement as to satisfy

quantitative require­

ments of the affects-commerce test.
In addition, the activities here in question, without
regard to the specific magnitude of interstate commerce
affected by them have effects which the Congress surely must
have intended to prevents, by enactment of the Sherman Act.
The allegations of the complaint present a picture
of perhaos the classic restraint of trade.
«

Two competitors

undertake to control and divide a market, to the exclusion of
a third.

The third, infused with management and capital by

an out-of-State source, undertakes to become an effective
competitor.

By the actions taken pvursuant to a noncompetitive

arrangement, this initiative is thwarted.

13

In this case, we submit, what we have is not. only
the stifling of existing competition,, the stifling of an
existing competitor, but what we have is the denial of
effective entry to a new entrant into the market through the
erection of artificial barriers around that market.
In such a case, purchasers and consumers in that
market are denied and deprived of -the advantages of free
competition, and the Sherman Act may be invoked against the
conspirators.
We believe that jurisdiction is also present here
under the in-commerce test.

HBC operates in the flow of

interstate commarce, and anticompetitive restraints on its
activities thus impact directly on interstate commerce.
In the American Building Maintenance Industries
decision in 1975, this Court has stated that to be in commerce,
the corporation must itself be directly engaged in the
production, distribution, or acquisition of goods or services
in interstate commerce„
HBC is a purchaser of a substantial amount of goods
and services in interstate commerce.

Management services

essential to the functioning of HBC, and of its provision
of hospital services, come from outside the State of North
Carolina.

The goods and management services purchased by HBC

for its operations, which .are an essential part of those
operations, are purchased on a continuing and regularly

19

recurring basis„

In all cases these goods* these services,

purchased in interstate commerce* originating outside the
State of North Carolina* are essential ingredients

of the

product* medical-surgical hospital services* which has been
purchased by the consumer.
We have touched previously upon the interstate
system of payments.

What we refer to as the nationwide

payment system* which today exists for the purchase of
health care in general and hospital services in particular.
In determining whether HBC is in interstate commerce* it is
particularly appropriate to consider this developing nationwide
system.
The existence* we respectfully submit* of a nation­
wide payment system establishes that those participating in
it are in interstate commerce.
Finally* the series of federal statutes* which* by
their own terms or through decisions of this Court* have
specific application to hospitals demonstrates the strong
federal interest in the furnishing of hospital services in this
country today.
0

We do not argue that jurisdiction under the Sherman
Act is conclusively presumed if the activities in question
,

are regulated under federal statutes.

i

We do say* however*

that to the extent that the activities in question are the
subject of other federal regulations *their supposedly local

20

character is diminished.
The pervasive regulation of health care services in
this country today demonstrates the major federal concern in
this area- and offers a strong indication that delivery of
health care services is not solely a matter of local concern.
Certainly the pervasive federal regulation of delivery of
hospital services is inconsistent with the finding below
that as a matter of law the provision of hospital services are
a purely local activity.
QUESTION;

What was the basis of Congress’s exercise

of its jurisdiction to adopt as pervasive regulation of the
delivery of hospital services?
MR. TRAIN;

Under the commerce clause, Your Honor.

And, as the courts have pointed out, when Congress undertakes
to regulate pursuant to its power under the commerce clause,
it leaves — it has one of two ways in which to go, in which
to determine whether specific activities are subject to the
regulatory system set up.

One is where Congress itself makes

a findingj the other is where Congress leaves it to the court
to make a finding.
The Sherman Act, of course, is the latter type of
statute.
QUESTION;

Mr. Train, just as a matter of pure

curiosity, are there many for-profit hospitals in the Southeast?
Do you know?

21

HR. TRAIN;

I think there are a fair number.

Our client owns several? and I do know of other companies in
that area.

There is a substantial number of for-profit

— I would suppose perhaps as many in the Southeast, since
that is a newly developing part of the country, as almost
anywhere.
QUESTION; Are they increasing in number or decreasing,,
do you know?
MR. TRAIN:

I believe they — in fairness., I could

say they are increasing a little bit; but I believe it’s probably
also fair to say the economy has been such that nobody is
building much of anything right now.
QUESTION; When you talk about pervasive regulation
of the health care# are you relying primarily on the Social
Security Act provisions dealing with Medicare?
MR. TRAIN; We're not talking so much about health
care as such# although we are relying on Social Security# we3 re
also —
QUESTION;

But that doesn't depend on the commerce

clause.
MR. TRAIN;

Excuse me.

I mean — I do not mean to

say the commerce clause.
QUESTION: Well# I was asking you a moment ago —
MR. TRAIN:
Act.

I was thinking of Pair Labor Standards

I was thinking of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

22

I was thinking of the Wage-Hour Acts «

1 was not thinking of

Hill-Burton, nor was I thinking of the Social Security ActQUESTIONs

Neither of those depend on the commerce

MR. TRAIN;

It’s the general welfare clause.

clause -—
But,

again, we think the point is that the enactment of such laws,
under any source of power for the Congress, demonstrates there
is a strong federal interest in the provision of hospital
services, and —
QUESTION; Well, I don’t see that bears on your case
at all.

I can see that you have an argument under fee Fair

Labor Standards Act, under the Occupational Health and Safety
Act? but the spending power does not depend on interstate
commerce»

MR. TRAIN:
QUESTION;

Yes, I —
Congress can spend, for whatever purpose

it. chooses, regardless of whether it bases any jurisdiction on
commerce.

And the fact that it may choose to spend, I would

think, doesn't advance or detract the contention that it's
jurisdictional? would you?
MR. TRAIN; We certainly don’t rely on that, for the
argument we make.

I would like to make that very clear-

Mr. Justice Powell?
QUESTION;

I was wondering whether you think, in

view of the arguments you make, that the Sherman Act has

23

substantially the same coverage with respect to in-commerce
and effect-on-commerce that the Fair Labor Standards Act has»
Or, putting it differentlyf can you think of any
business, any local business that would not be covered by the
Sherman Act under your argument?
MR» TRAIN:

Your Honor, ~

QUESTION:

I tried to think of one under the Fair

Labor Standards Act.

Window washers of an office building

are, for example.
MR» TRAIN:
QUESTION;
MR. TRAIN:

You say are?
They are. They have been so held»
Your Honor, I think you would --- I think

our position is you would have to have an analysis of the
market and

what sort of facts were being alleged with

respect to a particular occupation.
For example, with respect to window washers, it
seems to me that if you had a case involving a Sherman Act
complaint respecting a conspiracy of window washers, just like
you had complaints, which courts have upheld, with respect to
employing plasterers and with respect to journeymen or, rather,
wholesale plumbers, you’d have to see whether there was a
substantial effect on interstate commerce.
QUESTION; But you think they 'could be covered?
MR. TRAIN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
Right.

I understand»

24

MR» TRAIN:

If the allegations with respect to the

substantial effect were 'there.
QUESTION: And if you had a small town with three
restaurants in it, and two of them decided they were going to
fix prices to put the third out of business, they would
clearly be covered under your —
MR» TRAIN:

No, not necessarily clearly.

I think

you would have to, again, make an analysis as the Ninth
Circuit Court, for example, did in Page vs. Work.

And you'd

have to find what was the nature of the interstate commerce
purchases, how important they were, whether they were a
continuing part of the business of this business, and so forth.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that the restaurants

in question, instead of purchasing $112,000 in interstate
commerce, purchased $12,000, and did so regularly.
MR. TRAIN: Well, as I recall, the lowest amount that
I have —* that I recall seeing with respect to quantitative,
the quantitative aspect of purchases is the recent Seventh
Circuit decision as to which certiorari was earlier denied,
the Finis P. Ernest, case,

where there was some statement that

the contractor who had been, I believe, indicted under 'the
Sherman Act, had purchased some ten thousand ~~ or, rather,
had received some $10,000 from HUD in connection with a
building project.
QUESTION;

It might depend upon how large a percentage

25
the $12f000 was of the restaurant's total purchases»
MR. TRAIN;

Of the restaurant's total purchases, and

also of the total purchases with respect to the market.
QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION:

As the Fourth Circuit says, that not only

no bright line* but no line at all, is there?
MR. TRAIN:

I believe that's certainly true.

It’s

a particularized case-by-case determination, based on a
pragmatic economic judgment, and we believe that here the
pragmatic judgment is that Congress would have intended to
protect a market from the elimination of one out of three
competitors.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bolze.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAY S. BOLZE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BOLZE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I submit that in this Sherman Act jurisdictional
issue we should again look at the facts of this case.

My

client is Rex Hospital, a non-profit public hospital in Raleigh,
*

North Carolina.

As is alleged in the complaint, the product

market here is the provision of hospital services in Raleigh
and that is also the geographic market, Raleigh, North. Carolina.
The provision of hospital services is, as I think

26

almost everyone knows, is essentially such things as the
provision of a hospital room* provision of nursess services,
tlie provision of an operating room, a place where the doctor
can come and serve the patient, the provision of meals to you
while you.5 re in the hospital, the provision of linens on your
bed, all these various factors.
And it is true that at one time or other the bad that
you lie in as a patient for a week in the hospital may have
come from interstate commerce.
The surgical equipment used by the doctor when he
operates upon you may at one time have been purchased in
interstate commerce or from a local wholesaler who purchased
it in interstate commerce.

And that the medicines and drugs

administered to you in the hospital may at one time have come
from a manufacturer or a shipper in interstate commerce.
But, we submit, in virtually every walk of life this
is the case.

Indeed, I would submit that in virtually every

interstate transaction it is eventually consummater in a local
purchase, or a local delivery of a service.
That does not mean that since you are the ultimate
recipient on that chain you become a part of interstate
commerce for Sherman Act regulation.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bolze, you know there's a provision

in the Robinson-Patman Act that exempts hospitals, or at
least has a different provision with respect to the purchase

27

of products by not-for-profit hospitals.

Does that not

necessarily imply that the hospital is engaged in interestate
commerce when it purchases drugs , say, at a lower price -than
perhaps a wholesaler pays?
MR. B0L2E:

Well, Your Honor, my first answer to

that, of course, is we*re not dealing with the Robinson-Patman
Act, but the Sherman Act, and it’s —
QUESTION;

No, I realize that. But I'm suggesting

Congress, in enacting that, must have made some assumption with
respect to the transactions engaged in by hospitals.
MR. B0L2E;

Well, Your Honor, I v/ould submit that -—

and I have not checked the legislative history of that part of
the Robinson-Patman Act? but I would submit, and we do not
contend here, that hospitals could not conspire in such a
way as to come within the Sherman Act.

And Petitioner makes

the argument here that this is a constitutional question;
Car; hospitals ever come within the Sherman Act?
We do not argue, that.

We take the same position as

was stated in the Goldfarb case and was stated in the Yellow Cab
case, that there may be occasions when legal services or taxi­
cab services, that local activities could be of such a nature
that they could restrain trade under the Sherman Act. And I
would submit that Congress, in writing the Robinson-Patman
Act and putting that statement in, was not saying that hospitals
are always within the Sherman Act, you have to lock at the

28

individual restraint, which is what we’re doing here.
So I don’t think that that does get to our question.,
QUESTION;

Presumably only when the drugs come from

out-of-State.
MR. BOLZE;

Or — or, Your Honor, if the hospital,

as is in most of these prior Supreme Court cases, if the hospital
conspires with the out-of"State drug company, such as the
Frankfort- Distilleries case, such that you have a restraint on
that interstate flow of goods.

Not as indirect restraint? a

direct restraint.
And -fche Eighth Circuit, in the Bensinger case, talked
about the amount of money.

That was the exact issue.

I think

it was only several thousand dollars involved, but it was a
large piece of machinery coming from out-of-State to be
installed in a local restaurant.

But the restraint was on the

price of that piece of machinery.

It clear-ly was interstate

transaction, and the restraint applied to it, and therefore
it was Sherman Act.
We do not here have an alleged conspiracy between
the defendants here in Raleigh and these out-of-State
suppliers of drugs.
So I think that’s the question, you must deal with
the restraint here alleged, and whether or not it is sufficient
to be considered a restraint of interstate competition
QUESTION;

You don’t contend that there must be an

29

out-of-State conspirator?
MR. BOLZE:

Your Honor, I don't think —

QUESTION:

The Goldfarb case settles that, doesn't

MR. BOLZE t

Excuse me?

QUESTION:

You don't have to have an out-of-State

it?

conspirator.
MR. BOLZE:

No, you don't have to have one, but I

think if you don’t have one, as in Goldfarb, this local
activity being restrained must be an integral and necessary
part of this interstate commerce.
that case.

And I submit ours is not

And that’s what I would like to get to now, because

these local activities, such as ihe purchase of goods and drugs
by Rex Hospital, the receipt of — or not by Rex Hospital, byplaintiff; and the receipt of products used at the hospital.
These are not like Goldfarb, these are not the dominant
ingredients of hospital services.
I submit that anyone who has been to a hospital will
tall you that the dominant ingredient is the doctors and the
nurses, those facilities provided to the patient, the dominant
ingredient is not the drugs which cams in at one time, or the
bad that you lie upon.
Now, this is the —
QUESTION:

The doctor would be in pretty bad shape

without surgical instruments, wouldn't he?

30

MR. BOLZE:
QUESTIONS

Yes, he would be, Your Honor.
And they came in interstate commerce,

didn’t they?
MR. BOLZEs

At one time, Your Honor, yes, they did.

And the book —
QUESTION: The replacements come in interstate commerce,
don't they?
MR. BOLZE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the chair you sit

in, at one time may have come in interstate commerce.
I mean these, every walk of life has this connection,
Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, with respect to drugs, isn't there
more or less of a kind of continuous flow which would
distinguish it from the initial purchase of a bed and then
replacing it fifteen years later or replacing a chair in the
same way?
MR. BOLZEs

Well, certainly we — I mean, it’s alleged

here that'there are so many thousand dollars’ worth of drugs
that are purchased each year and come into the hospital.
Whether they are purchased from an outside, out-of-State
supplier or a local supplier is not clear.

I submit it doesn't

make any difference.
The Solicitor General's brief says they all came
from out-of-State.

That's not correct.

But. yes, there would be a flow of drugs every year to

31
the hospital.

There is a. flow of food every year to the

hospital, which comes from out-of-State.

But we say these

are incidental.
In the Yellow Cab case, those taxicabs, 3,000 taxi­
cabs didn't come from Chicago.

But yet that, the one alleged

restraint there was considered to be intrastate and local.
In Oregon Medical, there were substantial — it was
found in the lower court and by -the Supreme Court that there
were complete conspiracy of the Oregon Statewide Insurance,
medical insurance, and a conspiracy that the Statewide
Insurance Plan would not compete with the local county insurance
plan.

This, I think, was Count Three, the only count that the

District Court went off on mid said there was no interstate
commerce.
And it was found in the lower court and in the
Supreme Court, by Justice Jackson, that these Statewide
Insurance plans did make payments on their policies across
State lines, because they had patients who belonged to this
insurance plan going to other Suates and getting medical care.
So there was a continuous flow there also.
But that -—
QUESTION?

Mr. Boise, isn't the difference between the

Oregon Medical case and this that, as a matter of fact, there
was a finding of no adverse effect on interstate commerce?
MR. BGLZE; Exactly right.

32

QUESTION; Whereas here we have a complaint with no
trial yet being held* and there is an allegation of an adverse
effect? namely* that there will be a lesser flow of goods than
there would be if the hospitals were permitted to expand.
MR. B0L2Es

That is the allegation here, Your Honor,

but —• we were taking that allegation as true, that that
restraint was not sufficient.
Now, I submit, Your Honor, —
QUESTION:

I understand that.

I'm just going to the

question of whether Oregon Medical controls.

There you have

as a matter of fact found and decided by the Supreme Court net
to ba clearly erroneous, no adverse effect.
Here you have an allegation of adverse effect.
So, are not the cases different?
QUESTION;

An allegation that must be taken as true

in the present posture of this case.
MR. BOLZEs

Yes, but an adverse effect on a delay

in the expansion of a hospital by four months, by 91 days, and
therefore there would be some delay in drugs coming in to
that
QUESTIQN:

...But that's a different ~

that adverse effect is not sufficient.

you're saying

I'm just directing my

question to .the point that Oregon Medical doesn’t really
dispose of -this case.

We have a question of whether these

allegations are sufficient? I understand what you're arguing

33

about there.
MR,. BOLZE:

Yes.

Well, I would say, Your Honor, on

Count Three in Oregon Medical,

which is the one I am discussing

— in the first two counts the District Court found there was
no restraint of trade on the facts, so we don’t get to inters tate commerca.
On the third count, the district court, found that it.
was not sufficient for interstate purposes, and that the Supreme
Court upheld it on that finding.
QUESTION %

The reason it was not sufficient was that

there was no evidence, according to the findings, of any
adverse effect at all.
MR. BOLZE; Well, the Supreme Court said that these
flow of goods across State lines, which would be restrained,
was not sufficient? it was sporadic and incidental.
My point, though, Your Honor, is
QUESTION:

I*m not sure I understood fully what

you had in mind when you said that when a patient goes to a
hospital, the dominant --- I think -that’s the word you used ~~
MR. BOLZE;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— the dominant relationship is a personal

one with doctors and nurses.

Now, when a person consults —

and therefore these other peripheral matters, such as bandages,
sheets, and pillowcases- presumably not very relevant now —
when a person goes to a lawyer, is the relationship between

34

the client and the lawyer less a personal relationship than
with a doctor?
MRo BOLZE:

No, Your Honor.

Your Honor, I would refer to your statement in

,

Goldfarb

at the end, where you said that this is not a finding

that every legal service might or might not come within the
Sherman Act.

We deal here with the facts in that case, which

was that the price-fixing on legal fees for a title search
was an integral part of an interstate transaction between the
mortgages,'

55 percent of which were in D.C.

QUESTION:

A title search which usually involved

financing? that was the link, wasn't it?
MR. BOLZE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And 55 percent of the

mortgages in that case came from D. C. into Fairfax County,
which is substantial, and this Court found that without that
— without the — the mortgagee said, ”We will not grant the
mortgage unless the title search is made”, and the title search
is what was being price-fixed.
So it’s a direct link and it’s an integral part.
1 think that’s in line with the Frank fort. -— with the
Mandavi11a Farms case? a direct link.
QUESTION:

But the dominant relationship, to take

the parallel that you were making, or that I5m making, the
dominant relationship is still a vary personal one between
client and lawyer, too.

Whether it is dealing with a title

35
search , with or without a connection with financing of the
purchase*
I'm just a little puzzled why you put so much
emphasis on the personal relationship aspect*
MR.BOLZE;

Well, if I put that much emphasis on the

personal relationship, I'm talking about the provision of
hospital services, which includes ~ I mean,the primary service
you get in a hospital, I think, is the service provided

*

well- the room, the nurses, the doctors, the use of the
operating room.

It’s not the same — it’s not the same effect

as what you get when you go into a drugstore to buy drugs.
I mean, you're not going into a hospital primarily to buy
drugs, you're going in primarily for hospital service.
I'm not — I'll be the first to admit, there's no
fine line, and this Court has said it many times? but I think
this is primarily a local service we're dealing with here, and
the restraint we're talking about is a restraint on local
competition.
Now, this Court recognized in Yellow Cab;

interstate

commerce is si intensely practical concept drawn from the normal
and accepted course of business.
You must look at the common understanding in the
community to determine whether or not the facts alleged, the
restraint alleged, is interstate commerce or intrastate
commerce.

36
I would just like to point.out,, on these insurance
payments , the revenues that corae across State lines;

Petitionssr

hospital does receive its income, and it's alleged in the
complaint, over 56 parcent of it from insurance companies,
primarily Blue Cross, and also from Medicare and Medicaid,
The Solicitor General's brief states that therefore
that makes 95 percent of their revenues, and they all come
across State lines.
That is not the case.

That's an error in that brief.

No. 1, Blue Cross payments to Petitioner hospital,
the vast majority, and to our own hospital coma from Blue Cross
of North Carolina? just like roost States, they have their
own intrastate Blue Cross.
So it’s not an interstate transaction.

I'm sure

they receive some payments from insurance companies across
State lines.

But not the majority.

Secondly,, as to Medicaid and Medicare, the Solicitor
General’s brief is misread there, also? as is clear from the
Federation of American Hospitals’ brief filed and in our brief,
Medicaid and Medicare is federal funding, it's paid through
carriers and intermediaries, and in the State of North
Carolina it’s paid through Blue Cross of North Carolina.
When Petitioner’s hospital has treated a. patient that
qualifies for Medicare payments, they submit ~~ the hospital
submits its statement to Blue Cross of North Carolina, the

37
intermediary, and -they «— that's where they get their payment
for Medicare.

They don: fc make a direct submission to Washing­

ton , B. C.
Here again- this is a distinction between Goldfarb,
as the direct relationship and direct from outside the State
into the State. We don’t have that here.
QUESTION; Would it make any difference if the
payment were made by Travelers out of Raleigh?
MR. BOLZE:

Well, Your Honor, —

QUESTION:

I just wondered why you’re putting

emphasis on Blue Cross of North Carolina.
MR. BOLZE:

Oh, no.

Only because Blue Cross of

North Carolina is the intermediary for Medicare.

If it was

some other insurance company in North Carolina, I don't think
it would make any difference.
My argument is still the same.

It’s not a direct

link between the hospital and Washington, D. C.
I would not care who made it.
the intermediary is Blue Cross.

It so happens that

But it could be Travelers.

QUESTION: So your point is that some of what’s
said in the Solicitor General’s brief is just factually
inaccurate? is that right?
MR. BOLZE:

Yes.

In the

yes, the allegations

in the complaint and both Petitioner and ourselves, they just
make the statement they have these receipts of payments on

*

33

Medicare and Blue Cross.

But it so happens they don’t come

across State lines.
QUESTION;

They ars not interstate, they are intra­

state payments.
MR. BOLZE;

They receive some insurance payments in

interstate, but the vast majority is not.
Furthermore, in this Medicaid and Medicare, it is
federal funding under the general welfare clause.

And we are

concerned about this argument, because, first of all, in that
statute setting up Medicaid and Medicare, the amendment to the
Social Security Act, the Act specifically states that nothing
in this subchapter shall be construed, to authorize any federal
officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control
over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical
services are provided.
It’s stated in 42 U.S.C. Section 1395.
Yet what Petitioner would argue here by all these
connections with Medicaid and Medicare is that since they
receive this federal funding and have communications involving
the federal funding, we should taka these contacts with the
federal government under the general welfare clause and use
those to, we submit, expand the jurisdiction of the Sherman
Act under the commerce clause.
Now, I submit that is far-reaching, and, furthermore,
it was —- I noticed in the Federalist Papers, Madison’s Papers

39
Nos» 41 and 45. he discusses the general welfare clause, and
the argument that was made by opponents to the Constitution,,
that the grant of, in the first clause, of — about general
welfare and the common defense, people were saying that that
meant the federal government could do virtually anything»
And Madison specifically said there that thefc language is the
same language that was in the Articles of Confederation, that
they could provide for the general welfare; and it certainly
didn't mean they could do any tiling.
In fact, and as he says there, the clauses following
thereafter, the specific grants of power, such as the power
to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, specifically
qualify the powers of general welfare.
QUESTION: Well, Madison's view was rejected by this
Court in Butler against the United States in favor of Hamilton’s
view, I think; wasn’t it?
MR. BOLZE:

i don't think it was rejected on this

question of the general welfare clause, Your Honor.
Clearly, you can expand that.

I think it’s clear

from this -- this Court has never interpreted the grant of
power under the commerce clause to Congress as being as broad
as their power of funding under the general welfare clause,
which is what -QUESTION;

Well, no, I agree, but I thought you

were saying -that the general welfare clause is limited to the

40

areas in which Congress has an independent source of juris­
diction»
MR. BOLZE:

No.

No.

No, Your Honor.

I’m saying

that he makes vary clear that in reading the power to the
federal Congress you can’t say that the general welfare clause
gives them power to do anything9 to regulate commerce.

You

have to look to the specific grants thereafter.
QUESTION: But it does give them the power to spend
for tiny purpose —
MR. BOLZE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— that isn’t specifically limited by

the Constitution.
MR. BOLZE:
coxnraerce.

Right.

But not to control intrastate

Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bol?,e, let me go back to this

business of Medicare payments.
MR. BOLZE:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
I think the complaint alleges that a

substantial number of persons hospitalised in the Raleigh area
come from outside the State.

Sb then gets their Medicare

payments through North Carolina Blue Cross.

Is there any

aspect of interstate commerce with respect to those patients?
MR. BOLZE;

Your Honor, first, there is some allega­

tion of —some treatment of patients from outside the State.
In this brief before the Supreme Court, Petitioner apparently

41
has dropped that as one of its arguments.
But. bet that as it may, I am sure their hospital
treats soma patients from outside the State,, and they might
receive Medicaid.
I would submit, Your Honor, that however — whatever
the number of those patients are, and even if they do use
Medicaid and Medicare, that still is an incidental contact.
It certainly would not be nearly as substantial a connection as
in Yellow Cab, where you have the

transfer of interstate

travelers to their local homes.
So I would submit, even though they treat some
patients that come from outside the State, No. 1, Petitioner
has essentially, in this Court, dropped that argument? and
secondly, I submit, on the —
QUESTION;

Well, he may have dropped the argument,

but it's still in the complaint, isn’t it?

I read, "a sub­

stantial number of persons coming to the Raleigh area for
treatment in the medical-surgical hospitals there reside in
States other than -the State of North Carolina.”
MR. BOL-ZE:

Yes, Your Honor, it’s still in the

complaint.
.fend I*m willing to — I’m willing to go with that,
that they do treat patients coming from outside the State.
I’m submitting, under the case law, that is not considered a
sufficient restraint, because they are not — -the restraint

42

we’re alleging here

that’s what I want, to get to next —- is

what the language is in Apex Hosiery-

We’re not talking

about a dollar amount, we’re talking about whether or not a
local restraint restrains interstate commercial competition -we’re not talking about a dollar amount, we’re talking about
the effect. And this is pointed out nowhere more clearly than
the fl-Pex hosiery decision, which •— and I would like to just
quote a couple of lines from it.
"It was in this sense a preventing of restraints on
commercial competition that Congress exercised all the powers
it possessed in the Sherman Act."
Further quoting from Justice Stone’s opinion:

"The

Supreme Court has never applied the Sherman Act in any case,
whether or not involving labor organizations, unless the Court
/
was of the opinion that there was some form of restraint upon
commercial competition in the marketing of goods and services.
Restraints upon commercial competition have been condemned
only when their purpose or effect was to raise or fix market
price.

It is in this sense that it is said that the restraints,

actual or intended, prohibited by the Sherman Act are only
those which are so substantial as to affect market prices."
I submit, Your Honor, that’s what the test of
substantiality in an interstate area is, not a measure of
doliare or cents? but a measure of — and this, I think, is
what Judge Craven in his majority opinion was talking about

43

below, that:

does the local intrastate restraint have an

effect of restraining commercial competition in interstate
commerce?

Not whether it delayed

. $10,000 worth of goods

coming into the State.
QUESTION:

Mr. Boise, if the dollar amount is

irrelevant, I wonder what your view is on the Third Circuit
case involving the Philadelphia hospitals, which I recall
involved -the curtailment of the number of hospitals in the
market?

Would you say that that case was correctly decided?

And if so, how do you reconcile that with what you've just —
the argument you've just made?
MR. BQLZEs

Your Honor, I reconcile it — and I

reconcile it the same way that Judge Craven did below? when
you're talking there, as you were, in the Doctors8 Hospital case,
with the restraint which would effectively close down 100
hospitals in a two-State area, you are talking about interstate
commerce.

I don't even think that is an effects test, that's

an in-flow test.
I think it was clearly distinguished by Judge
Craven, and I think it’s certainly not this case.
QUESTION:

What's the difference — there are

two differences, one, there are more hospitals, and, two, you
close down instead of preventing expansion.
MR. BOLZE:

Well, there's a third, a very important

one, those hospitals alleging restraint were in two States.

44
Philadelphia and Delaware — or Pennsylvania and Delaware*
QUESTIONs

I see,

If it were in one State.» you

would say the case would have been decided differently?
MR* BOLZE:

No, sir, I don't say that.

Because there

were 100 hospitals involved.
QUESTION:

Well, if you — then you don't rely —-

MR. BOLZE:

Here we’re talking about —*

QUESTION:

~~ on the two-State point. The points

you rely on are:

one, the difference in tine number of

hospitals? and, two, the difference between ex pension and
curtailment.
MR. BOLZE:

Your Honor, I would rely on all three.

I submit again, under the language of this Court, the test in
each Sherman Act case is one of degree.

I would — you have

to look at —- there I would look at all three of those issues.
QUESTION: But even though you have 100 hospitals,
what effect on interstate commerce is relevant?
Other than their purchases of supplies across State
lines.
MR. BOLZE:

Well, I think, closing 100 hospitals

compared to a four-month delay in the expansion of a 91-bed
hospital is just vastly different as to the effects it could
have on commercial competition.
QUESTION:

Then the difference — the difference

is entirely in the dollar value of the two situations.

45
MR* BOLEE:

I say you can look at the dollar value,

Your Honor, to see whether or not it would have a substantial
effect on competition.

But I say you can’t just look and

say* What’s the dollar amount.
QUESTION:

But the competition is not competition

in the- providing of hospital services.
MR. BOLZE:

No, that’s correct.

QUESTION:

Rather than competition in selling goods

and services to hospitals.
MR. BOLZE:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would ~

QUESTION:

And you say there’s a de minimis

effect

here and there’s a significant effect there, that’s your
difference.
MR. BOLZE:

I say that there the effect could be

such as to cause a suppression in commercial competition for
those goods and services, because there are so many coming in.
So it is -— yes, you can look at the dollar amount,, but you
can’t
QUESTION:

The difference, if you have stated it

correctly ~~ I want to be sure I understand your theory.
The difference is between a substantial effect there and a
de minimis effect here.
MR. BOLZE;
■fie flow of goods.
res training trade;

You don’t contend no effect here?

I contend there would be some effect on

I contend there will be no effect as far as

46

QUESTIONs Welly but -fche only effect in the other
case is an effect on the flow of goods, that you — it seems
to me you've acknowledged that if that effect is substantial,
then there’s Sherman Act jurisdiction.

And the difference,

as I understand you, is that here you are contending the
effect is de minimis.
Or is there something I'm missing?
MR, BOLZE;

No — well, I guess there is,

I feel the fact that the defendant there

was

operating in a two-State market, and it was concerned with
100 hospitals, —
QUESTION?

Well, you're changing your position

again,
MR, BOLZE: Well, I don’t think I am, Your Honor, with
all due respect.
QUESTION;

But is it or is it not critical that

there were two States involved there?
have it both ways.
MR. BOLZE;

I don’t 'think you can

Either it’s critical or it is not,
Your Honor, I would submit that it’s a

questioned degree in each case, and I think there it was
critical.

I would have to look at all three tests there.
I do not think you can look at just the dollar amount.
Your Honor, I did want to get into this comparison

to other statutes, Fair Labor Standards Act, National Labor
Relations Act

47
I would submit first* as Justice Frankfurter stated
in Bunta Brothers s
"Translation of an implication drawn from the special
aspects of one statute to a totally different statute is
trecherous business."
Now* there’s no doubt about it* the Fair Labor
Standards Act* the Civil Rights Act, the National Labor
Relations Act were drawn up, as this Court has found in numerous
cases, including Mary1and v. Wirtz, Fair Labor Standards Act.
was drawn up, those statutes, in such a way that. Congress made
a decision that as a class of activities these payments,
payments of substandard wages in class of activities could
as a whole have an effect on interstate commerce.
Congress did not find that in the Sherman Act.
The Sherman Act does not stats that it applies to any local
restraint if the parties involved have some connection with
interstate commerce.

The restraint itself must be on

interstate commarce.
Justice Powell, I think, put it very clearly in Copp
Paving:

the jurisdictional inquiry under general prohibitions

like these Acts and Section 1 of the Sherman Act, turning as
it does on circumstances presented in each case, requiring a
particularised judicial determination, differ significantly
from -that required when Congress itself has defined toe
specific persons and activities ‘that affect commerce, and

48

therefore required federal regulation.

Comparing Yellow Cab

to the FLSA cases.
Of course the language of these statutes does vary,
too, which is in our brief,
I would submit- under the Civil Rights Act, if you
so much as treat on© interstate patient, you come within that
statute,

That:;s not the test under the Sherman Act,
Finally, I would get back to the quotes in Yellow Cab

and Goldfarb.

We are not arguing that a hospital can in no

way conspire, such as to restrain interstate trade,

WeEre

saying in the facts of this particular case, and the Sherman
Act must be looked at in each case, there is not a restraint
of interstate competition.
Now, this does not leave Petitioner without some
relief.
Act,

North Carolina, like most States, has a mini-Sherman

In fact., its language is identical to the Sherman Act,

except it says 51 restraints of North Carolina trade” rather
than "restraints of interstate trade".

It has a treble-damage

provision, providing people with suits, they can go into
State court.

So.they are not left without a recourse,

Now, referring —» or keeping in mind the tremendous
increase in antitrust cases in the federal courts, I think
there were 457 antitrust cases in the federal courts in 1963
and there are .1467 in 1975, of which 1375 were non-government
civil case.3 like these,

Keeping -that in mind, and the fact

49
that the State courts and the State statutes are there and
they are being used more and more each day, and the ABA Antitrust Journal each year puts out all the State cases, I would
QUESTION:

Those increases are about on a par, and

perhaps even balow increases in a lot of other areas, I'm not
sure how important it is*
MR, BOLZE;

That I don't know, Your Honor,

I would

just, because of that, though, and the fact that there are
State statutes very similar to these, I refer back to the
language of Chief Justice Hughes in Jones & Laughlin:
i!Undoubtedly the scope of this power must be considered in
light of our dual system of government and may not ba extended
so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect
and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society1,’
which would obliterate and set up a completely centralized
government.

The question is necessarily one of degree.

And it's a choice of degree in this case.
I would submit also in

-the South-Eastern Underwriters

case, which is quoted quite a bit, Justice Black, after he
referred to the fact that in enacting the Sherman Act Congress
went to its entire under the constitutional powers, stated
right there after, about our dual system of State and federal,
and referred to a quote by Senator Sherman in enacting the
Sherman Act, as follows:
is to arm the federal courts with the limits of

50

their constitutional power that they may cooperate with the
State courts in checking, curbing and controlling the most
dangerous combinations that now threaten the business, property
and trade of the people of the United States."
In conclusion, we submit the subject matter test
under the Sherman Act is one of degree, based on the unique
facts in each case.

There’s no clear line.

We submit, in

such an area, the lower court must make that initial decision.
And if it makes that decision based on the guidelines set down
by this Court, we submit that the lower court here did, and
its decision
QUESTION:

Mr. Bolze, your reference to Justice

Black, I think he dissented in the Oregon Medical case.
MR. BOLZE:
QUESTION:
MR. BOLZE:

He may have. Your Honor.
Somewhat ambiguously
I8m not sure if he dissented on all

three counts.
QUESTION:

Somewhat ambiguously, he didn't indicate

whether he thought the findings of fact were erroneous or
whether he thought the evaluation of the legal aspects were
erroneous.
MR. BOLZE s

Yes, Your Honor.

But, in conclusion, wa do feel in these types of
cases, unless — since no clear line or no clear rule can be
laid down, you must put some control in the hands of the lower

51
court»

And if it applies the rules correctly., as we think it

did here, applied the guidelines, unless it is clearly
erroneous» it should be upheld.
It was upheld here by the Fourth Circuit and also
by the Fourth Circuit en banc decision which we feel applied
your rules correctly under your cases, and it should be
upheld.
QUESTION;

Let me read Justice Black’s comment in

the Oregon case.
MR. 30LZE;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

In full.

It!s two lines.

Mr. Justice

Black is of the opinion that the judgment below is clearly
erroneous9 — the judgment below is clearly erroneous and
should be reversed.
MR. BQLZE;

Yes, Your Honor.

I take it — as I say, the only reason I was quoting
South-Eastern Underwriters was because it is a strong case for
Sherman Act enforcement, it does have his statement in it,
that it still is a dual system, and he does quote from
Sanator Sherman about the dual system.

And that's the purpose

I was quoting it.
Thank you. Your Honor*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
