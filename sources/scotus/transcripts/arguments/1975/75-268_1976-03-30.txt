MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

et al »
Mr. Sands, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRA JAY SANDS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SANDS:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice and Mr. Justices of the Court:
We have a very simple factual situation here in
which a national bank is one of a number of defendants under a
1934 act — securities action, a XGB5 claim.
And we go back to a widely-known dispute iri this
t

nation in which we find the Thir^ Circuit now recently aligned
against all of the other circuits as to whether in a securitiesrelated 1CB5

action, the plaintiff must divide his case and

must sue the National Bank in the particular district in which
that National Bank was established, or whether, under the wide
venue provisions of the S3'J Act, the plaintiff may join the
National Bank together with the other defendants in the district
in which the violations took place or,as the ’34 act permits,
where the defendants may be located or found.
It is our position that in the Second Circuit where
this action commenced, under the Brunsf Nordeman case, the
situation is jelled and a divided, bifurcated litigation would

be required.,

It is our position, sir, however, that that is

erroneous and that the 1864 National Bank Act was not necessar­
ily repealed by implication or otherwise by th 1934 Act, but
that the venue provision of the 1864 Act was broadened, was
extended in the one instance in connection with a 1934 Securi­
ties Act violation,
Now, to lightly touch upon ancient history in the
hallowed
QUESTION:

Mr, Sands, you say in one instance and

;you are talking, of course, about the ’34 Act but 15 U.S. C.
77B, the '33 Act and the Interstate Land Sales regulations
are —- certainly are other acts giving general venue for
; J

specific causes of action which would ba affected by a
decision in this case,, aren’t there?
MR. SANDS:

Your Honor, we, of course, are concerned

with the ‘34 Act and the '33 Act which would overlay it as well.
However, your Honor is correct.

When any act states

that.the defendants may be sued in a venue where they may be
found or where the transaction took place, I would agree,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the argument I am professing for
the 534 Act would apply if the language were similar.
Now, going back to ancient history and the

hallowed

halls, we know that the National Bank is an arm of the American
Government,

The cases are galore and have not been cited for

the lack of piling on additional material.

The First National

5

Bank was organised in the late 1700's as an ana of the govern­
ment and it could not be sued* as the government cannot be
sued, without its consent»
Now, until the 1863 as modified by the 1864 Act,
one could not sue a national bank which was set up to adminis­
ter currency, which was set up to administer the fiscal policies
of the United States, except as specifically permitted by the
Congress, by the sovereign»

QUESTION;

your argument.

Well, the point may not be

important to

I didn’t mean to have you spend a good deal of

time on it.

V
i 5 ..

MR. SANDS:

My recollection is not precise as to it

being in the S.E.C.'s amicus brief, but it is in the footnote
"•.that the first bank was called the Bank of the United States
;.md then we had a la.pse of its charter some ten years or so

6

later and then another bank was set up to administer the fiscal
policy of the United States called the First Bank of the United
States or First National Bank of the United States and the
1863-1864 legislation was all-encompassing, a schematic to
operate national banks.
How, we take the position that this was permission
by the sovereign to be sued, to have one of its instrumentali­
ties sue and the sovereign determined where it can

be sued.

It can be sued in the district in which it was
constituted.
Now, we fake no issue with that until 1933-1934.
1933 and 1934, of course, we find the — as it is commonly
called, the Roosevelt legislation concerning the "33 Act, the
’34 Act, the so-called remedial statutes concerning banks and
the like and we find that we have a number of cases, of Bell
against Hood, S.K.C. against Joiner, remedial statutes.

We

go all the way down to Affiliated Ute case, which was decided
only recently, S.E.C. against Capital Gains Bureau.
The idea that the remedial statutes be broadly and
non-restrictively interpreted —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sands, is there anything in the

legislative history that

shows that Congress actually con­

sidered national banks at the time of the enactment of the
Securities Act?
MR. SANDS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I say yes,

In

7
emphatically yes.

Tho national banks, in '33 and *34, were

under consideration.

There is a Senate report which is

referred to in our brief.

The S.E.C. has referred to that.

The Comptroller has referred to it as well, as we did.
The problems of national banks were divided, in our
analysis, in two parts.
One, the necessity to protect the investors and the
depositors.

We all remember the run

on the Bank of the United

States.
QUESTION:

Let rae direct my question, however, to

the venue provisions.
MR. SANDS:

Yes, sir.

There is nothing precise, Mr. Justice Blackman,
that we have been able to locate which indicated that the

Congress considered the venue provision of national banks at
that time.

We can only reason from our incisiveness, which

•we. hope is accurate, in that there is decisional law which
Indicates that Congress knows every statute on the subject when
it legislates.
Congress did set up the Glass-Steaga.il Act to con­
cern itself basically with protection of depositors, protection
of the bank itself in that regard.
Congress 3et up the *33 and 934 Act in which it did
not set forth any exceptions whatever to the venue provision
with regard to any actions concerning the !33 and the '34 Act.

8

There is no legislative history that the precise
question was ever discussed.

It is merely by inference.

Now, our position is that there is no reason for
implied repeal, although the facts as they approach would give
us the effect of implied repeal, if we would like to but
judicially, we are constrained to say that both may exist to­
gether, if that is possible.
Now, our interpretation of these acts would leave
both fully intact;in securities matters the plaintiff and the
Commission would have its choice of venue.

In non-securities

matters or, except as Mr. Justice Rehnquist aptly pointed out,
in other matters where there may be statutory language, one
would have to follow the Bank Act of ’64.
Now, Congress did exempt, in the '33 and ’34
when it so desired.

Acts

There were certain definite exemptions.

In Levin against Great Western Sugar Company, which
was a District Court of New1 Jersey case, which started a Third
Circuit run of matters that indicated that there was a wider
venue than did the Second Circuit, the judge said, "A quick
examination of the ’33 and 9 34 Acts revealed that on a number
of occasions, the legislative draftsman found fit to exempt
national banks and their securities from provisions of the Act."
And then he cites 15 U.S.C. 77C, 15 U.S.C. 77L, efc
cetera.

It becomes clear that the legislative draftsmen knew

about national banks when writing the securities acts and knew

9
how to exempt them from provisions of the acts when it choose
to do so.

It would be an usurpation of legislative prerogatives

for this Court to impute an exception to the '34 Act in view of
the background just described.
Now, the Chicago Bank in, as amicus in its brief,
admits that there are exceptions for United States banks — for
national banks — and for the United States Government from
the registration requirements of 382 of the '33 Act.
The Comptroller admits that as well on

page 6 and

again on page 16.
In this Court, in Carnation against Pacific Con­
te rence in 1965, quoted United States against Borden, which is
303 U„S., to this effect;

any

"If Congress had desired to grant

further immunity, Congress doubtless would have said so."
The courts have, in addition, carved out additional

immunities from the 1864 venue.

For instance, this Court, in

1968, Great American Insurance against United States, carved out
an exception for a claim being filed by a national bank in the
Court of Claims and said that the national bank must go to
another district where the Court of Claims was sitting in the
particular matter in order to file its claim and the national
bank there said, "But you tire taking this out of the district
that the 1964 Act required."
This Court said, "No, if you are filing a claim
under the Court of Claims Act, you. must go to that district

10
where that matter is now pending»
In transfers under the JPML, which happen all the
time, the JPML has consistently said to national banks, "You
must follow along the case»

You are not protected in any

manner by the 1864 venue to have a separate bifurcated pretrial
in your own district.

You must follow the case.

"Then, of course, you’ll come back later on after the
pretrial is concluded."
And we have that in such cases as Pittsburgh and
hake Erie Railroad, Great Western Ranches, Glenn ‘Turner.
have that in

We

Westec.

Now, we have another rule which has been followed
by the District Courts.

I haven't found authority that it has

come up here — and that is concerning the impleted third party,
where a national bank is impleted as a third party and then
says, VLait, I can only be sued in my own district.

The district

courts, the circuit courts have a Fifth Circuit Lone Star
package against Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, said —- and there
are others — said, No, if you are a third party impleted
defendant, you must go to the district where the action is
being litigated.
Basically — basically, the reason behind that, I
believe, .have been "judicial economy.

We can "just visualize the

number of different bifurcated trials that would result if the
banks had that cloak of immunity.

Ii

Now, I do not — in fact, I insist that the Congress
did not, in 1864, give the banks the cloak of immunity but the
Congress, as the sovereign, in 1863 and 1964, opened the
field, opened the wall of sovereign immunity and gave us
permission to sue national banks at that time and then, in
1934, the Congress again opened the wall of immunity because
of the overriding concern for the populace involved in
securities frauds so it is not a question by which our
national banks have for 30 years impressed the lower courts
that they are protected, that there is immunity,, that the
statute was made for their protection.

I say no.

I say the 1864 statute was made to permit banks to
be sued, not to protect the banks from all suits.

The 1934

statute was enacted to permit banks to be sued a little more
widely in a more practical sense.
Now, there is no reason why both of these inter­
esting statutes may not live together, may not be supplementary,
may not each be fully effective.

They certainly can coexist.

We found that in the Robertson case, 422 U.S. where
we had two acts which

were permitted to coexist.

This Court has frequently admonished the lower
courts to attempt to prevent conflict in statutes, achieve the
aim of the 1934 act.
Merrill Lynch against Ware# not many years ago.

We

12
have been admonished to interpret statutes by practical
experience and practical experience certainly would

permit the

banks to be sued in a securities-related matter in the same
district where everyone else is.

Now, oren going back to these interesting old cases
such as Red Rock against Henry, unless the
repugnant, keep

them both alive.

acts are completely

And we have a long line of

decisions.
In Wilmot against Hudge, which is 103 U.S. back in
1880, this Court said that both statute»can be said to have
their own spheres of operation.

If both can stand by any

reasonable construction, that construction must be adopted,
the basic tenet of law in this nation.
We have an interesting case, 1846, Beals

against

Hale, and there this Court discussed a parliamentary example
where Parliament said that a particular* crime was punishable
at Caesar's Court and then Parliament subsequently allowed
another court to have jurisdiction.
This Court stated that in examples like that, you
must reconcile them.

They both must exist and the government

in a particular situation like that would have a choice of
either forum.
Now, in the Posadas case, Posadas against National
City Bank, which my learned brother had attempted to interpret

"It is well-settled that where legal rights have

to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available
remedy to make good the wrong done."
QUESTION:

Mr. Sands, before you proceed, if I may

interrupt you, it has been your submission up to now that these
two statutes can coexist with — can compatibly and congenially
coexist.

I understood you correctly, have I not?
MR

SANDS:

That, sir, is my strongest argument.

feel strongly about that.

I

I have also placed my leg on the

other point that even if they cannot coexist.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if one looked only at the text

of the venue provisions of the National Bank Act, the 1864 Act,

your argument would have a very great deal of merit, I think
because it simply provides that actions and proceedings
;?gainst any banking association may be brought.

But we have

the Lango case and the Michigan case which construe that
language and that statute to say that this is exclusive, that
it is not permissive, that it is exclusive and I don't really
follow you when you say that these two venue statutes can
coexist.

I don't mean that you lose your case if they can’t

but the Securities Exchange Commission, for example, tells us
that these two venue statutes are in hopeless and irreconcilable
conflict and —
MR. SANDS:

I cannot

QUESTION:

— you obviously disagree because you

say they can both coexist.
MR. SANDS:

I do not fully agree with ray very

learned brother at the SEC and I have told him that.

I think

he has taken a stronor viewpoint that they cannot coexist.

It

is ray position, sir, that the cases which you mentioned refer,
not to two special federal venue statutes.
QUESTION:

No, but they did construe the venue

provision of the National Bank Act, did they not?
MR. SANDS:
a state act.

Yes, sir, but they construed it vis-a-vis

They did not construe it vis-a-vis an equally

significant federal statute.
The 1864 statute did not say that no future act may
further enlarge the venue and the 1334 Act did further enlarge

venue.

The case which your Honor has cited construed the

question of permissiveness with regard to a state venue and
there there is no question in mind.
I do not know of a single decision reasonably
interpreted which would permit any state statute to enlarge the
1864 venue provisions.
But Congress is Congress.

If Congress is, in effect,

Congress may enlarge what

it previously had restricted.
QUESTION:

There is no question of the fact that

provision.

It could have repealed it.

It could have done a

variety of things to it but everybody agrees, I gather, that
there is nothing -- Congress has certainly done nothing
explicit with respect to the 1864 Act.
MR. SANDS:
believe they did.

Explicit, it did not.

Implicit — I'm sorry.

Implicit, we

I didn’t mean to

interrupt you, sir.
QUESTION;
MR. SANDS:

No, no. I’m finished.
Implicit, we believe they did for the

precise reasons that the *34 Act was an all-encompassing method
of operations with regard to securities, something quite new
in this nation.

The exception was not put in there.

I have

mentioned that the ’34 Act did accept, precisely accept,
certain activities vis-a-vis securities of national banks,
vipecifically accept national banks, United States Government
securities and similar and I read Judge Gruenfeld’s language
opinion in the District of Connecticut in which he said they
knew how — a little sarcastic, as I read it — and interesting
in his emphasis — they knew how to except if they wished to
except.
There was no exception.

There could be no exception

to a state statute which attempted to broaden the 1864 law,
except from the 1864 law.
I therefore differed with my brother at the SEC in

16

their amicus brief when I said that the 34fch statute is
supplementary tc the 64th statute.
QUESTION:
MR. SANDS:
QUESTION:
MR. SANDS:

Why did you abandon your waiver argument?
I have not, sir.
I thought maybe you had.
No, sir, I have not.

I feel that waiver

is a hard row to how.
QUESTION:

I noticed you didn't cite the Nearbo

case, 308 U.S. where this court held that there had been a
waiver by a corporate defendant of a right to be sued under
this statute by the filing of a consent to service a process
not too different from that of your case.
MR. SANDS:

No, sir, we did not

cite that cade.

There have been situations where waiver has taken place.
QUESTION:

You didn’t — you haven't raised the

waiver issue in your petition for certiorari.
MR. SANDS:

We did, sir — I believe we raised it in

the petition for cert and we have raised it in each one of our
briefs.

We have not, however, hammered hard upon it.

X feel

'that waiver is our weakest argument in this regard —
QUESTION: Do you think your question presented
subsumes the waiver issue?

You have presented one question.

Should net the Court resolve once and for all a serious conflict
by declaring that the more liberal venue provisions in the
Securities Act prevail over the stringent National

Bank Act?

17
That is the question you presented»
MR. SANDS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Does that include waiver?

MR. SANDS: No, sir.
Well,
QUESTION: /that is the end of the waiver question,
isn't it?
MR. SANDS:

No, the two questions which I did

present in our brief include the second as a waiver and I have
said, sir, without a question, that the waiver is the

weakest

of the two arguments.
QUESTION:

Now, we didn’t grant certiorari on that

question because it wasn’t presented to us.
MR. SANDS:

I am perfectly content, your Honor, to

hold firm on the question of, both statutes living together or,
in the alternative -QUESTION:

Unless you want to argue that it is

plain error or something.
MR. SANDS:
QUESTION:

No, I do not, sir.
Well, in your petition, you did refer to

the waiver — not in the

question presented, but you talked

about it elsewhere.
MR. SANDS:
QUESTION:

In the body, sir.
You gave greater, much greater emphasis

to it in the District Court than you have here, and even in your
brief.

18

MR. SANDS:

Weil, your Honor, Mr. Gottlieb, who

argued in the District Court and in the Circuit Court, was met
with a dilemma.

There is no question, as he said to Judge

Mulligan, there is no question but that the law of the Second
Circuit is very clear.

The Bruns, Nordeman case.

when Mr. Gottlieb presented orally the Third

And that

Circuit decision

and Judge Mulligan said,"Do you wish us to reverse ourselves?"
Mr. Gottlieb's language, in effect, was a polite suggestion
that in view of the fact that the retired chief judge had
previously reluctantly affirmed in the Bruns case that he
politely was suggesting that perhaps you might reconsider it
In view cf the fact that you now have a peg to hang your hat
on the waiver question

the reluctance was something that we

were hoping would cause the panel to change.

The panel was

very quick to affirm.
Mr. Gottlieb held in his hand a xerox copy of the
Third Circuit —- the Ronson against Liguifin decision and I
believe, if I recall correctly, read a passage or more from it.
The waiver was what he picked to hang one's hat
upon and we could not expect the District Court to reverse the
circuit by a frontal attack upon the propriety of the 1864
statute, either as an implied repeal, which I still maintain
is our second leg, or the cooperation between the two, the
supplementary effect, the either/or situation.

Bank case in which they spoke.

They tried to get around it by

claiming that there was a waiver situation because the bank
came across the state line to do business and conferred itself

that historically they have taken the position that the
National Bank Act of ’64 is mandatory and we insist it is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL E. GATES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GATES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
t;

I am here appearing for the Respondents, First
[National Bank of Boston only.
■ ,

At the outset, I would like to set the record

straight on the posture of this case.

Before the lower courts,

yfche only issue raised by Petitioner in this case was one of
waiver.

The allegations of this complaint have charged that

there had bean a violation of Section 10B of the New York
State statutes in the common law and that arose out of the
alleged issuance of some false and misleading statements by
Teleprompter, Inc. which

had been developed as a result of a

formal complaint and investigation by the SEC, whereupon a
class action was brought in the Southern District of New York.
The plaintiff purported to bring the action under

21

the venue provisions of Section 27 of the Exchange Act.
Now, the complaint does not allege that the bank,
i/hich was the agent bank in a $150 million credit and loan,
agreement, had anything to do with the alleged issuance of the
false statements.

It doesn’t allege that the plaintiff, the

bank, purchased or sold, the Teleprompter stopped, or that it
made any profit out of any of the transactions complained of.
The basis of jurisdiction and cause of action
against the bank, as I see it — and I am not sure that I am
right -- is that the bank is alleged to Lave aided and abetted
the other defendants and that it reached its fiduciary obliga­
tior „s to the investing^ public because it did not disclose to
the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange or the public generally
Yr

the information which it had learned as a lending bank and
which was alleged to be inconsistent with the statements
issued by Teleprompter, whereupon, relying upon this Court's
decisions . in hangdon and Robertson, which makes mandatory

the

application of Section 94, we moved under Rule 12 and Section
94 to dismiss for lack of proper venue.
Now, at this point, your Honors, may I say I want to
make our position perfectly clear.

We are not saying that the

Exchange Act does not apply to a national bank.

We are saying

only that the venue must be laid in the district where the bank
is established and whatever rights Petitioner may have here, he
can pursue in the District of Massachusetts.

22
Now, Petitioner has conceded that the bank is
established in Boston and, indeed, as it has been since 1864,
right after the National Banking Act was put into effect.
And he conceded in his affidavit --- which appears at
page 77-A of the Appendix, that under normal circumstances,
section 94 of the National Bank Act would prevent a bank
foreign to this -— meaning the southern district — from being
sued in the southern district.

But he argued that because the

bank had qualified under Section 1313 of the New York Banking
Law to engage in a limited fiduciary capacity in its activities
in Mew York that that constituted an intentional waiver.
Now, this was the issue which was before the
District Court.

The District Court found as a fact that there

had been no waiver.

Petitioner appealed to the Second Circuit,

again on the issue of waiver.
QUESTION:

V?as Naarbeau argued to the District

Court?
MR. GATES:

It wa3 not, your Honor.

It was not

cited in any of the briefs.
At no time in the District Court or in the Court of
Appeals in any of this record until you get to tha oral
arguments betore. tne Second Circuit is there ever a reference
to the fact that there might be some conflict between Section
11 end Section 94.

There is not one word of implied repeal or

repeal by implication.

Only when it got to oral argument was

23
fche Ron son case cited by the Third Circuit in 1973 ever
mentioned and then when it was mentioned by counsel for the
Petitioner, he didn5t urge that as a basis for an implied
repeal»

He did not rely upon it on that basis at all.
Now, Petitioner has agreed in answer to

questions

from Mr. Justice White that, in effect, he has abandoned his
argument of waiver.

Well, I submit, if your Honors please,

that one has only to look at the question which appears on
page 3 of the

petition for certiorari to see that there is a

single question posited and that question —
QUESTION:

Well, you — I take it you have just

argued that — are you implying that that question isn't

Well, are you suggesting we ought to

dismiss the petition for

cert as iraprevidently granted so

chat —- or vacate it and remand it so that the Second Circuit
may tell us what the answer to this question is in the Second

25

Circuit?
MR. GATES:

Well, I think it would he presumptuous,

Mr, Justice White, for me to fell you what this Court ought
to do and I would therefore

refrain from responding.

But let me answer it this way:

At the time of the

argument before the Second Circuit, Judge Mulligan, who was
the presiding judge, turned to Mr. Gottlieb and said, "Counsel,
are you suggesting that this Court reconsider or overrule its
[sic]
decision in Bruns against Nordeman?1’ And Mr. Gottlieb
responded in the negative.

He said he was not ask.'rig that

thcit be done.
Now, I submit that on the law as developed in this
area, going back a great many years but referring'specifically
to your opinion, Mr. Justice White, in Langdeau followed by
Robertson and the cases that have

followed subsequent to that

time, that there is no need to repeal, particularly whan you
say, the substantive provisions of the Act can be applied.
Granted, there may be some inconvenience.
there may be some hardship.

Granted

But in this case, I submit, that

the hardship is much less than it was in Michigan National
Berk against Robertson and if we are going to decide that
repeal by implication is to be determined by hardship, it
world be contrary to the decisions that have coma dcx^n from
this Court in the past.
But let me move from this question of the fact that

26
I have some doubt about whether I should be here today»
know I am.

I

Let me try to deal with this question of implied

repeal a little bit.
This Court has not directly passed on the question
which the Petitioner posits here today.

I am frank to say

that there is such a shift in position that occurs with
respect to this Petitioner that I am not sure just what I am
called upon to respond to.
In the lower courts we were talking about waiver.
The petition for certiorari talks about the broader provisions
of the securities lav/s prevailing over the narrow provisions
of the Banking Act -- or can they coexist?

And then in the

reply brief we get a completely different —

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gates, you may pick

up where you left off.
MR. GATES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I think when we recessed at the luncheon, recess
that I was about to say that in Bruns, Nordeman, then

Chief

Judge Friendly, relying upon this Court’s decisions in Borden,
Robertson and Langdeau, found that there was no basis for
implied repeal.
Mr. Sands this morning in his brief has attempted to
differentiate at least Langdeau and Robertson on the grounds
that they only have state statutes involved.
Now, that precise question was presented to Judge
Friendly of the Second Circuit and in what I think was a very
careful analysis, he rejected that argument saying, in these
words, that”it would indeed strain language to say that the
same verbs are merely permissive with respect to suits in
federal courts, although prohibitory as to action in state
courts."
Mow, clearly, Section 27 —
QUESTION:

But did he not go on and say that they

were foreclosed in that circuit by an earlier decision?
MR. GATES:
Stevens.

That is not ray recollection, Mr. Justice

28

QUESTION;

I think he doas»

I think those were the

two points that he made.
MR. GATES:

I will stand corrected if I am in error.

Clearly,

Section 27 does not by its express terms

repeal Section 94 nor did Congress say, as Petitioner has
asserted in his reply brief, that in enacting the '34 Act —
and I quote --"Congress intended that a national bank in a
securities case could be sued in certain specified additional
act districts."
Now, Petitioner admittedly gets no help from the
legislative history.

He has acknowledged this morning that he

can make only an implicit argument.
But he argues that the two statutes can coexist and
the principal thrust of his opening argument seems to be that
implied repeal of Section 94 can be found because

the

bread public interest at the time of the enactment of the
Securities Act required it.
In 1934, Congress was consumer-concerned.

The 1934

Act was meant to supercede any earlier conflicting statutes.
But so far as we are able to ascertain, nothing
supports these assertions except the ipse dixit of counsel
but they go even farther at page 16 of the opening brief and
they say, "Congress itself evidenced its intent, in 1934, to
impose the venue provisions of the 1934 Act on oil concerned."
We can find no case from this or any Other court

29

which supports the thesis that silence will support implied
repeal.
Wow, as Mr. Sands has acknowledged this morning,
the s.E.C. in its brief, makes a completely different argument
saving that the adherance to the decisions of the Second and
Ninth Circuits would frustrate the policy of the '34 Act and
would have an adverse effect upon the enforcement activities
of the Commission.
I would remind this Court that the 1934 Act has been
m

in effect for 42 years.
not cite a

Yet the Commission in its brief does

single instance where resort by a national bank

to the provisions of Section 94 has impinged upon or interfeired or adversely affected the Commission' s enforcement
activities.
The sole justification advanced in support of this
thesis is that the Commission may be unable, someday, to join
some national bank in some unidentified future enforcement
proceedings.

That argument was made just ten years ago before

the Southern District of New York in an action entitled
General Electric Credit Corporation against Talcott where the
Commission again filed an amicus brief.

The Department of

Justice, representing the Comptroller of Currency, took an
opposite point of view.
Judge Tenney made a very careful survey of the
situation

and he came to the conclusion that there was

30

nothing to support the conclusion of implied repeal»
Now, in a somewhat different context* but I submit*
a similar situation, Mr. Justice White, in writing for this
Court, said,

in Mercantile National Bank , that this was a

problem for Congress to consider.
this Court.

It wasn't a problem for

One would have thought, had there been, in fact,

an interference with the Commission's enforcement activities
during the last 40 years that they would have gone to Congress
and sought help.
Now, they have not been reluctant to do so in the
past but they have not done so here.
Whatever may be the speculative views of Petitioner
as to the intentions of Congress or the — whatever the SEC
believes are the controlling policy considerations, we have
been unable to find any support in any decisions in this
Court which will sustain an argument for implied repeal.
To the contrary, this Court has consistently taken
the* view that absent a waiver by a bank,that Section 94 man­
dates that all transistory actions shall be brought only in
the district where the bank is established.
Now, in order to sustain implied repeal, there are
two cardinal precepts, as we read

the cases, which must be

undertaken and established by the Petitioner.
One, there must be a clear and manifest intent to
repeal and, two, there must be a positive repugnance or an

31
irreconcilable conflict.

We

find neither of those present in

this situation.
There is nothing to support, in our judgment, clear
and manifest intent to repeal.

In an effort to buttress the

arguments of the Petitioner and its own arguments, the SEC
in its brief refers to the report of Senator Fletcher of the
Senate Banking and

Currency Committee and says that this

sustains the position.
I submit that the Fletcher report is completely
irrelevant to this argument.

It was

not submitted to the

Senate of the United States until after the '34 Act had become
law and it made no recommendations of any kind with respect to
remedial legislation.
Now, certainly, at the time that the 1934 Act was
adopted, Congress was aware — and this is conceded by
Petitioner •— of the special status which Congress had granted
to the national banks going back to 1364.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gates, would

it have been sufficient,

in your view, dealing with the repeal intent, if somebody had
gotten up on the floor of Congress and said, the ’34 Act
venue provision is broad and we mean it to apply just in its
literal language?
MR. GATES:

It would have been very considerable

assistance, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if you had found something
like that but we have found nothing of that nature to indicate

32
that there was any real consideration given to this particular
issue.

It is quite true that the Congress was concerned about

abuses which had been developing and existed in the securities
industry but they were also well-aware of the special, status
of national banks.
QUESTION:

If it would

hav<3 been sufficient to

simply get up on the floor and say that, why isn't it even
more impressive that they used broad, general language in the
statute itself?
MR. GATES:
argument.

Well, I suppose one can make that

I do not happen to subscribe to it based upon the

decisions which have, emanated in

this Court but certainly

conceptually, one can make that argument and I would be
lacking in candor if I didn’t acknowledge it.
But I can’t believe that simply by enacting Section
27 and by

silence that it can be properly construed that

Congress intended to amend or repeal Section 94.

But the

Petioner has, it seems to me, an even more difficult burden
in sustaining implied repeal in that he must show positive
repugnance or irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes
and I submit that the Petitioner has made no attempt'at such a
showing.
In his reply brief at page 3, he concedes that
implied repeal is more
terms a coexistence.

difficult to establish than what he
I think it might have been a little bit

33

more accurate if he had said it was impossible under these
circumstances to establish implied repeal.
Then on the next page of his reply brief, that is
page 4, under the heading, the two venue statutes are supple­
mentary and not in conflict.
He apparently abandons any effort at showing
repugnance and he characterizes this as the major point of
his argument.

He said this morning that there is no reason

why they can't coexist, a position which is diametrically
opposed to that of the SEC, which spent the entire brief that
it submitted as amicus in establishing that there was repug­
nance and a direct conflict.
X submit that when Petitioner is talking about
harmonization of the two statutes that you can make them each
effective in its own sphere, he is engaged in — if I may use
a colloquialism — kidding himself.
He asserts that each special statute is a special
grant by Congress of a forum that if more than one statute
applies that a plaintiff has the benefit of both and he can
make his choice.

That is of Section 27 or Section 94.

With respect I suggest that if that were the law and
the situation, there would foe no need for us to be here today
and I would suggest also that even if he is correct, the fact
that he may make a choice does not mean that he is going to be
able to stay in that forum because Section 1404A of the

34
judicia.1 code is still on the books.

It may well be that a

defendant can invoke the provisions of that section.
I submit that Petitioner is really not asking for
harmonization.

He is asking for an exception, an implied

repeal of Section 94 where Securities Act law violations are
charged and he would equate such exception to that exception
recognized by this Court with respect to purely local actions
in Casey against Adams.
Now, as I have indicated, and as Mr. Sands agrees,
the Commission is not in accord with Petitioner’s views that
the two statutes can coexist.

Rather, it argues that the

two venue statutes are in direct and irreconcilable conflict
and the Section 27 supercedes Section 94.
It says that they are repugnant in both their
policies and thair practical effects.
cede that if Section

However, it does con­

94 prevails, then the bank can be sued

only in Boston.
It seems to me that by making such concessions, it
is an overt admission that the Exchange Act can be made to
work against the bank in Boston.
Now, in attempting to establish repugnance, the
Commission relies on two cases decided by this

Court only

last June, Gordon against the New York Stock Exchange and
United States against the NASD.

It argued that Section 94

has been impliedly repealed by Section 27 because such repeal

35

is necessary in this case to make the federal regulatory
scheme work in the securities industry.
In that regard it seems to me that the Commission
overlooked Silver against the New York Stock Exchange which
says that if there is repeal by implication it will be granted
only to the extent necessary to make the act work and then
only to the minimum.
But those two cases, if the Court please, I submit
are distinguishable.

In each of those cases the requirements

of implied repeal have been clearly satisfied.
In order to make the regulatory scheme work as
envisioned

by

Congi-ess with respect to fixed rate commissions

and with respect to the sale and distribution of mutual funds,
this Court held that the anti-trust laws had to give way.
There was no way to reconcile the restrictive
agreements which had developed in the securities industry with
the, anti-trust laws, the scheme that had been envisaged by
Congress, but there is nothing in the case at bar which makes
these holdings applicant.

-As I said earlier, the substantive

previsions of this law can work in Boston just as well as they
car, in New York.

The bank is not immune from the terms of

the securities laws nor is it exempt from perpetual liability
that violates the terms.
We say only that the issue of whether it violated
the terms should be determined in the District of Massachusetts

36

rather than the District of New York.
QUESTION:

Has there been some case in this Court

construing the word "located "
MR. GATES:

in Section 94?

There is, Mr. Justice White, but I am

frank to tell you the narae of it escapes me.
QUESTION:

Do you think it has actually been

decided here and that "located” means the place if

its

incorporation?
MR. GATES:
QUESTION:
MR. GATES:

No, your Honor.
What does it mean, then?
I understand that "located" equates

itself to what I would term what might be the principal place
of business, if you talk about it in terms of general
corporate law, whereas, established, which is the word which
is used with respect to a national bank, being sued in a
federal context, I understand to mean the place where its
charter says that it is established,»
, .

To wit, the home office.
QUESTION:

But it says that, "Or in any state,

county or municipal court in the county or city in which said
association is located."
MR. GATES:

That is correct, Mr. Justice White, but

as I interpret the statute, as I have understood from the
decisions of this and other courts, the

word "locate" relates

itself to actions which are brought in state courts and that is

37
where the bank must be located whereas when you are talking
about actions in the federal court, the word "established" is
used.
QUESTION:

Well, what if this action had been

brought under state law in the state courts?
MR. GATES:

Well, then, under your Honors' decision

in bangdeau, I don't think we have any problem.
QUESTION:

Well, I

know, but that case didn’t focus

on location, did it?
MR. GATES:

Well, there were 145 defendants in that

action of v/hieh two were national banks and in an opinion
written by your Honors, it said they had to go to another —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the big issue in

Langdoau was whether or not that was — whether it was
exclusive, whether that venue provision was -- whether the
word "may1' meant "must."
MR. GATES:
QUESTION:

That is quite true.
And it didn't really go to the question

of what the meaning of the word "located" was.
MR. GATES:
QUESTION:

That is also correct.
Well, so, again I ask you.

Do you know

of any cases that construe it?
MR. GATES:

I have to tell you I do not, Mr. Justice

White.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gates, your time has

It has?
