MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in No. 74-596 8,, Geders against United States.
Mr. Honig, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEYMOUR L. HONIG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HONIG:

Mr. Chief Jxjstice and may it

Please the Court:
My name is Seymour L. Honig.

I am an attorney

from Tampa, Florida.
Seated at counsel table is Richard H. Mclnnis,
also an attorney from Tampa, Florida.

Mr. Mclnnis and I

represent the Petitioner, John Geddes.
Your Honors, the Petitioner is here pursuant to
issuance of writ of certiorari for the Fifth Circuit to
review what appears to

be a conflict between two circuits

regarding the question presented for review before this
Honorable Court.
The matter on review arises out of certain trial
proceedings in the United States District Court, Middle
District of Florida, Tampa Division, in which the
Petitioner, John Geders, was on trial as a Defendant
charged with particular offenses.
During the trial the court issued an across-theboard incommunicado order prohibiting the defendant from

4
communicating or having an/ access to and with his
attorney during a 16-hour overnight recess period between
the conclusion of direct examination and the conclusion of
cross-examination of the defendant himself.
The relevant factual situation, your Honors, as
it relates to the question presented for review, commenced
on the next-to-the-last day of trial.
At thiit time, the Petitioner Gedars took the
witness stand on his own behalf and his attorney,
Mr. Rinehart, who was the defense counsel at the time of
the trial completed direct examination at approximately
4:55 p.m. in the afternoon, a usual time for recess in the
United States District Court, the Middle District in Tampa.
However, in response to a motion of the
prosecutor, Mr. Blasingame, his Honor, Judge Krentzman,
decided to recess the particular trial until the following
day.

Apparently Mr. Blasingame wanted to prepare, as is

not unusual, for cross-examination because there was an
extensive direct examination of the defendant in that
particular matter.
But recess was not ordered, your Honors, before
the prosecutor, Blasingame, questioned the '"ourt with
respect to certain instructions that he desired that the
Court issue to the accused and his counsel

and with the

permission of the Court I would like to refer to page 17 of

5

ths Appendix at. which time Mr» Blasingame stated, "Has this
witness been instructed now that he is not to talk to any­
one whatsoever, including iis attorneys —- or anyone —
about this case at all?"
And this is the prosecutor, your Honors,
addressing the Court at the time that recess was going to
be ordered by the District Judge.
Just below that Fir. Rinehart, in response
thereto, stated, "If hs were instructed not to talk to
his attorney, I feel that it would be improper.
always have the right to talk to my client."

I think I

Of course

the emphasis is mine but the words were Mr. Rinehart's.
QUESTION:

Mr. Honig, at this point, let’s

follow through on that.

Suppose this were a noon recess —

the same answer?
MR. HONIG:

The same answer?

Well, your Honor,

Mr. Justice, this was a situation when he was denied 16
hours with his counsel.
QUESTION:
recess of one hour.
MR. HONIG:

I know, but suppose it were a noon
Would your answer be the same?
Yes, it would be, your Honor, but the

reason •—
QUESTION:

Supposing it 'were a rest and

relaxation period to allow the jury to go to the bathroom,
five minutes.

Same answer?

6

MR. HONIG:

It would be essentially the same

answer, your Honor,, because it would be a violation of a
basic constitutional safeguard.
QUESTION %

In logic, you have to give that

answer, don. * t you?
MR. HONIG:

In logic and in practice and in

defense of the Constitution as I see it, your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

And then suppose the judge here had

said,"We®11 finish with this witness tonight” and declared
no recess..

Would you be here?
MR, HONIG:

If he declared no recess and cross-

examination was continued immediately subsequent to direct
examination, no, not at all, your Honor, I would not: be
here,
QUESTION:

Even though xt continued well past

your closing time in the Middle District Court?
MR. HONIG:

That is. correct and I would not

object to the fact that counsel for the defense would
have not the opportunity to discuss anything with his client
during the process of cross-examination, which I well
understand, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:
absolute.

So that your right to discuss is not

It depends on the accident of a recess,
MR, HONIG;

No, not completely, your Honor.

My point is this, that the recess did occur, but

7
at the instance of the government, who moved for it, not
the defense»
If the recess — and it was — granted, then
certainly I would submit respectfully that defense counsel
should not be denied the right to consult with his client
and this would be most consistent with the right to
assistance of counsel for one’s defense, pursuant to the
Sixth Amendment, sir.
QUESTION :

You have the right to insist on a

recess between direct and cross-examination at all times?
MR» HONIG:
the right.

Mo, your Honor.

One does not have

I would say this would be discretionary with

the Court and I would say that in this particular situation
the Court accommodatad the Government.
As matter of fact, the judge, the trial judge,
was well-prepared to continue with the proceedings and go
with the cross-examination but the government moved for a
recess because of its reason to prepare.
QUESTION s

Would it make a difference if you had

requested the recess?
MR. HONIG:
submit.

Mo, it would not, your Honor, 1

If the government — if his Honor at that time

assented to a recess, then I

would submit that certainly

counsel and client would have a right to consult with one
another.

8
QUESTIONi

Well, suppose the judge had you

making the application, granted provided —
HR. HONIG:

Defense was making the application,

Mr. Justice Brennan?
QUESTION:

And the judge said, "Granted,

provided you do not talk to your client during the recess."
MR. HONIG:

I would be here for that, your

Honor..
QUESTION: You would?
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, your Honor, I would be.

You are saying that a trial judge

has no discretion whatever to limit the conversations of the
witness who is
MR. HONIG:

Defense witness, Mr. Justice,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. HONIG;
QUESTION:
MS, HONIG:
QUESTION:

—- who is under cross-examination.
Yes, your Honor.
Defense witness or defendant?
This is defendant
Defendant.

' our Honor.

I thought you -were

confining it to
MR. HONIG:
wifcnes s„

Defendant.

This is not a

defense

A defendant.
QUESTION:

— confining your claim to access and

communication between him and his counsel at a time when

3

he is not on the witness stand.
MR. HONIGs
QUESTION:

Precisely.

That is exactly my point.

And that is the answer to Mr» Justice

E1ackmun9 s ques tion.
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

I misunderstood you.

Why go so far as to say that if there

is a five-minute recess, the judge can tell him, "You sit
there and don’t talk to anybody” that that is a violation
of somebody’s

rights?

MR. HONIG:

Why do you go that far?
Because X would submit that this is

inherent prejudice, that there is inherent prejudice that
flows from the violation of that basic constitutional
safeguard.
QUESTION:

Say the judge said, “For the next

five minutas, nobody talks to anybody.”
reversible error.

Then you get

Why do you have to go that far?

You

have got 16 .hours in this case.
Why do you have to cut it to five minutes?
QUESTIONi

Well, he had to answer our

colleagueE s questions»
MR. HONIGs

Yes, I cut it — this was in.

response to your colleague’s questions, Mr. Justice Marshall.
If it would be five minutes to 16 hours, nsy answer would
be much the same.
QUESTION:

It is your case.

10

MR, HONIG:
QUESTION;
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION;

Sir?

'

It is your case,
Yes, sir.
Yat you concede that the defense

counsel doesn't have a right to insist that cross be
interrupted, cross of his client on the stand, in order
that he may confer with him for a few minutes.
MR. HONIG:

Not during the trial proceedings

itself in the midst of a courtroom, unless some undue
occurrence happened to take place.
QUESTION:

So that the right of consultation

between the defendant and his counsel is not an. absolute
one.

It can't be demanded at any time during the

proceedings.
MR. HOiJIG;

I would submit that a 16-hour

recess,subsequent to a recess, is a critical stage of the
proceedings at which time the guiding hand of counsel has
to be present, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in meaningful defense,
QUESTION; The

guiding hand of counsel to coach

the man what to say on cross?
MR, HONIG;

Ho, your Honor, no.

Excuse me,

your Honor, that is not what I meant to say at all.
Coaching is not what defense counsel in this case wanted to
do.

He wanted to discuss with

his counsel — this is the

next-to-the-last day of trial — witnesses who might be

Ii
called and trial strategy.

This is always something to

be discussed between attorney and client.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't Judge Krentzman allow

that sort of a consultation?
MR„ HONIG:
QUESTIONs

I beg your pardon, your Honor.
Didn’t Judge Krenfcsman, in his order,

allow that sort of consultation?
MR. HGNIG:

Not actually.

With all due respect

to Judge Krentzman, who I have great respect for, his
statement was, really, in effect a sham because what he
stated to counsel was that he was to discuss before the
bench what witnesses he was going to, planning to call.

In

other words, consult with his client with respect to what
witnesses they were going to decide to call — really,
rather a privileged
revelation mother of privilege matter before the bench and
then Judge Krentaman said, well, I am not going to
sacrifice this whole matter for* your strategy? in effect
this is what he said.

This is what is revealed in the

Appendix. "And if we need a month after this, I'll give it
to you to prepare your case or to continue with strategy
but you are not going to be able to talk to your client
at this particular stags for 16 hours or whatever time it
was until the conclusion of cross-examination the
following day, Mr. Justice Kehnquisfc.
QUESTIONs

You mean that Judge Krentzman would

not permit Mr, Rinehart and the Defendant to confer about
order of witnesses, even for five minutes outside of the
judge's presence?
MR, HONIGs Thera is no evidence in the record
as to that.

The record reflects —
QUESTION:
MR. HONIG:

What page are you referring to?
Yes, may X refer you to —

Mr. Justice Rehnquist and other Honorable Members of this
Court, to page 19 of the Appendix and it is the fourth
time that the Court speaks and the third paragraph.
”1 think you might ask him right now — right
here while we are here — what witnesses he thinks you
ought to call in the morning.'3
Mow, X would respectfully submit, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, that the trial judge is treating this situation
as a fishbowl situation.

He has the defense counsel before

him with his errent, with the defendant and says, “If you
want to call witnesses in the morning, discuss it right
here and we will get on with it but you are not going to
talk with each other and have any communication with each
other until the termination of cross-examination the
following day."
QUESTION %

Sea, that is a

pretty ambiguous

colloquy to ask us to reverse a judgment after a completed
trial.

If you concede that had it been out of the court's

13
presence, it would have bean all right.
MR. HONIGs Welly I submit, your Honor, that this
is a basic constitutional safeguard, the right of assistance
of counsel and this is the basis and the gravimerxt of our
argument, the right of assistance of counsel for one's
defense and it does not only, we respectfully submit, prevail
in a courtroom but outside of a courtroom as well.
The eve of the last day of trial is the critical
stage of the proceedings with defense counsel and, we
respectfully submit, sir, and his client have every right
to discuss trial strategy and the calling of witnesses or
whatever in preparing for the follo\*ing day's trial.
I think that every trial lawyer has done this.
find that the evenings are most critical in any stage of
trial, sir.
QUESTION:

What if the trial judge had said, in

taking your short recess hypothetical case, if the judge
had said •—
K”

I-IONIG:

not my hypothetical.
QUESTION:

Begging the Court's pardon, that was
I believe that ■—
Well, the hypothetical you were

addressing.
MR. HONIG:
\

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And that is not an uncommon thing, to

have a great range of hypotheticaIs —

I

14
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
-- by which to test# by analogy, the

argument being made.
MR. HONIG:

Yes# your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

Now, suppose the judge had said, "The

jury may be excused but everyone else# both counsel will
remain in the courtroom and the witness will remain on the
stand,"as was suggested before.

Dc you think you have then

been deprived of an opportunity to consult with him?
MR. H0N2TG:

If the defendant were told to remain

on the stand and the jury was removed and what have I?

I

don't quite follow, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
take it —

The judge says,. "We

are going to

The jury is excused for 10 minutes but the

witness who is now under examination will remain on the
witness s t and„"
MR., HONIG:
QUESTION:

And that — well, your Honor —
That is the defendant# the defendant

witness.
MR. HONIG:

The defendant witness is there and

there is a 10-minute recess in effect because the jury is
out and. the judge is not out of the courtroom.
QUESTION:

Yes.

the courtroom but says#

He is there.

Well, let's.say the judge leaves

let's pursue that, "You remain in

the witness stand and counsel, you will not consult with him

15
during this recess."
MR. HONXG;

He is technically — I would say that

that would be a correct ruling on the trial judge.

It would

be questionable but I would tend to say that would be a
correct ruling, in view of the fact that the

defendant has

not left the witness stand between direct and crossexamination , he is still in the midst of the proceedings,
QUESTION:

The purpose of all this is, of course,

very clear, is it not?

The discretion vested in trial judges

to see that witnesses are not coached before they are going
to be subjected to cross-examination by the opposing counsel.
MR. HGNIG:

This is quite correct^ your Honor but

I must respectfully submit that no trial judge in the United
States hats any discretion with which to violate a. basic
constitutional safeguard.
QUESTION:

Well, we would all agree on that fine

generality, I am sure.
MR. HONIG:

Yes, sir.

Thank you, your Honor.
Your Honors, at the conclusion of the -- oh, yes,
the Government in its appeal, in its brief to the Fifth
Circuit, I feel — and I submit has mislead the Court to
some measure in that they confused the issue, your Honors,
by indicating that, the prohibition between counsel and th§,
defendant was a limited prohibition only relating to the

.16

prohibition with respect to discussing testimony when, in
fact, of course, this was an across-the-board incommunicado
or a total incommunicado ordez* -- no reason, no consulting
whatsoever about anything and the next day when the Court
to
did resit, the Court stated/Mr. Rinehart, as appears on page
20 — questioned him, I should say — "You have not talked
with him, of course, have you?"
And Mr* Rinehart says, "No, I haven't„M

And this

would clear up any doubt as to the limitation or the narrow
prohibition regarding the incommunicado order,

It was, in

fact, total and complete*.
Counsel was not permitted to talk to his client,
the defendant, at ;11 for

2

period of what appeared to be

16 hours.
We would respectfully submit, your Honors, that
there are certain matters which are self-evident and basic
in dealing with the question presented for review and they
are:
One -- and X submit that self-evident and basic
is that error was commited by the trial judge.
Secondly, that the error was a constitutional error.
Thirdly and self-evident and basic, we would urge,
is that the Federal constitutional error was one in violation
of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States and that the portion of the Sixth Amendment which was

17
violated was that part which pertains to the right of
assistance of counsel for one’s defense»
And lastly we would urge that this violation, this
Federal Constitutional violation, occurred during the critica],
stage of the proceedings, namely during the trial itself
between the termination of direct examination of the
defendant and the termination or conclusion of crossexamination of the defendant the following lay by the
government prosecutor.
We would further submit that the denial of right
to consult with counsel for a 16-hour period of time is in
contravention to a basic constitutional safeguard and as
such is inherently prejudicial and is per se reversible
error.
In support of this position, the Petitioner relies
upon Glasser versus United States, Powell v. Alabama,
Hamilton v» Alabama., Gideon versus Wainw: y/hfc, and Argersinger
versus Hamlin and these cases, we submit, all pertain to the
denial of assistance of counsel for one’s defense and we
would further submit, as we have before, the denial of
assistance of counsel for one’s defense in each of the above
cases, from Powell v, Alabama through Argersinger-v, Hamlin
was deemed inherently prejudicial and was, per se, reversible
a.

error.
In the Glasser case, without going into any

18
quotations,, the Court considered that the right to have the
assistance of counsel was so fundamental and absolute a
right that the courts could not indulge in nice calculations
as to amount of prejudice arising from the denial and we
would submit that that is correct»
We further contend , your Honors, that the rule
of harmless error as promulgated in Chapman v, California
is irrelevant and inappropriate to the question presented
for review.
We would submit,, your Honors, that the harmless
error rule applies to the evaluation and measurement of the
prejudicial quality and quantity, if any, of tainted
evidence admitted in the trial of an accused.
But the harmless error rule, we would submit,
is not applied in measuring prejudice which inherently flows
from the violation or from the denial of a basic constitufclonal safeguard,,
We urge that the harmless error rule, as
proraulgaged in Chapman, v.

California does not apply nor can

it realistically apply to a violation of a basic
constitutional safeguard.
This Court has recently dealt with harmless error
cases in Harrington y„ State of California and Milton v.
Wainright.
I would submit, two very typical cases where

19

harmless error has been applied and in both cases the court
was dealing with the admission of tainted evidence, if you
would, or testimony but in the face of which there was
overwhelming evidence to convict and so this was deemed by
the court to be harmless constitutional error but the
Chapman v, California doctrine puts the burden of proof above
reasonable
and beyond the exclusion of all/doubt, as you have in any
criminal proceeding, upon the government to establish the
absence of prejudice or harmless error»
It would be impossible, we submit, for the
government to at all put forth such proof in this particular
case, nor have they, and not having done so it certainly
could not be considered harmless —• they certainly have not
met their burden with respect to the harmless error doctrine»
The Fifth Circuit, we submit, was in error»
One, they not only misapplied the Chapman case,
we submit they should not have applied the Chapman case to
the particular ruling that they made in this case, but they
misinterpreted it as well.
Chapman is very clear, I would submit, your
Honors, that the burden is upon the government to prove
above any reasonable doubt that there was an absence of
prejudice or harmless error and this is to protect them»
QUESTION:

In Chapman you are* talking about

evidence which ultimately got into the trial which should

20
have been excluded so you have something factual that the
government can at least go ahead and start evaluating and
say it could not have made any difference.
Here all you have is the absence for a period of
time of the right to consult between the defendant and his
counsel.

Now, supposing in that sort of a case this Court

were to say at least the burden of going forward with some
sort of a showing that it might have been prejudicial .is
up to you.

What showing would you make here?
MR, HONI’G:

I would submit that —- if 1 was asked

to do that, that we would be flying in the face of Chapman,
your Honor.
QUESTION:

So you say, in effect, you couldn't

make any such showing.
MR. HQNIG:
QUESTION;

For this reason, your Honor —
Or do you say that you couldn't make

any such showing?
MR. HONJG:

Oh, I say that we coals make such a

showing, your Honor but to make such a showing it would be a
privileged matter.
QUESTION;
MR. HQNIG:

So you, at any rate, you —
It would cause it to be a privileged

matter.
QUESTION:
so now.

At any rate, you are unwilling to do

21
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:
MR. HONIG:

Well, if 1 —
If ha asked —
— am ordered to do something which I

consider to be unconstitutional

,

then I , if I am ordered to

do so, I would protest doing so.
QUESTION:

No individual justice of the court has

power to order you to do anything.

All I am asking is, is

there anything you would wish to disclose to the Court as
to why this might in any way have hurt your case?
MR. HONIG:

Well, yes, your Honor.

May I make it

on three points?
One
again.

and I don't want to sing the old song

I say it is inherently prejudicial pursuant to the

Glasser versus United States decision.
QUESTION:
MR. HONIG:

Which is no showing at all.
That's right, there is no showing at

all because the prejudicing here is in the act.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Honig, if you think there is

a Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel that has
been violated, there is simply no room for the application
of the harmless error rule,
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.
Well, then, why are you fencing about

whether you could or could not show it?
MR. HONIG:

Oh, I am not fencing.

I believe that

22
I can show it right now,

I suggest to Mr. Justice Rehnquist

because he —
QUESTION:

I

MR. HGNIG:

You are fencing because I asked you.
Yes, and I'll be very happy to answer.

The defense counsel at this trial stated very
specifically — and I could refer the Court to the particular
quotation here — where he states that he wants to discuss
v/ith a client the calling of witnesses and also the discussion..
He wants to have a discussion of trial strategy with

his

client.
I would say this is per se reversible error in
view of the fact that he has bean prejudiced.

I think that

I would submit that he has this inviolable right, to have a
discussion of trial strategy and the calling of witnesses
with his client.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ilonig, on that score, suppose

the judge, Krentzman, had said, when the objections came
from defense counsel, that "If you need time for this final
round-up before the close of the trial, the order will stand
but I will give you a recess of as long as

you want, one

day, two days, whatever you need after the cross-examination
is completed."
Would that take care of the problem?
MR. HONIG:
would not.

No, your Honor, I would submit that it

23

QUESTION:

Well, then, does that narrow it down

that the only thing that the defense counsel wanted to talk
to him about that night was his cross-examination the
following day?
MR. HONIG:

The only thing that is revealed on

the record is chat the. defense counsel did want to discuss
with him matters of witnesses and trial strategy,, which
takes in the

whole spectrum of things in that respect, we

submit.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't all that be done in this

hypothetical recess that I have suggested?
MR. HONIG:

It would depend upon the trial

strategy in the recess and the witnesses that they would
want to call.
QUESTION:

Well, mind you, you are at the end of

the day, the end of the court day.

The judge says, "You

can’t talk to this many about his cross-examination tomorrow
but if you need 24 hours after that to plan the closing
stages of the trial, the Court will give it to you."
That would not cure the error that you see.
MR. HONIG;
QUESTION:

No, your Honor and ■—
Well, then, does that not narrow the

proposition down that you are really arguing for a
constitutional right for a defense counsel to coach his
witness?

24

MR» HONIG:

Not to coach his witness, never to

coach his witness, your Honor.
supporting perjury.
QUESTION:
MR, HONIG:

That would be possibly

No, no.
Is that a consequence of your position?
No, not to coach a witness, your

Honor, but to discuss with him, to have the assistance of
one's client and counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, go back to the hypothetical,

then»
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
If the judge said he had given the

24-hours* recess after the cross-examination, would that not
give you everything that you say was going to be the. purpose
of the consultation?
MR, HONIG:

I would say that not necessarily,

your Honor because things can happen that particular time.

I

would not conceive of what would happen but there are things
that could conceivably occur that might be vital to that
trial and it would he a critical stage of the trial.
QUESTION:

Could you just give a hint as to what

one of them might be?
MR. HONIG:

Between direct and cross-examination

providing there would be a 24-hour period of recess given
after that?
QUESTION:

For the purpose of doing all the things

25
that you said —MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

Yes.
—• ware, imperative to be done during

the 16 hours.
MR. HONIG:

Yes.

There might be a witness who

would be leaving town or witnesses who would be leaving the
city and it would be necessary to have them called immediately
and have them subpenaed so they would be there tomorrow on
the court order.
QUESTION:

The court's powers are pretty broad about,

subpoenas, aren't they?
MR. HONIG:

Weil* it just may be that these people

may not be locateable the following

day and so that particu­

lar time it might be necessary -—
5.

••

•v

QUESTION:

Well* you are not suggesting that that

is something beyond the remedy?
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

I —
Subpoena them and bring them into the

courtroom and have them sitting there as long -- or an suiteroom as long as you. want them.
MR. HONIG:

Well* your Honor* may I — without

being evasive to your hypothetical» may I just raise this
hypothetical, with due respect.
If the Court,

looking at the defense counsel,

said, "I don't like the way you part your hair, so

26

consequently thereof you are not to discuss this case with
your client until the termination of cross-examination and
then after that I'll let you have 24 hours to discuss the
case with him,"
QUESTION:
MR. HONIG:
your Honor?

Well, I have —
Would there be any difference there,

I doubt it.
QUESTION:

I have difficulty seeing what that has

to do with the hypothetical question I put to you.
MR. HONIG:

This, your Honor.

I believe that if

the Court affirms the ruling of the lower court here, it
would lay a potential ground for the opening of a floodgate
of possible judicial wrongdoing.
I consider this judicial wrongdoing.
The Court has asked me what could possibly happen
between the conclusion of direct examination and the
conclusion of cross-examination providing counsel and his
attorney are not allowed to

consult and providing that

there be a 24-hour recess period after that.
I have mentioned just one item.

It could be that

ha '— without coaching him he might review what questions
he thinks the government might propound to him on crossexamination without giving him the answers.
He could say, "Well, perhaps the government may
ask you A, B, C, D and E be ause this would;be logical for

27

then to do so,so you should be ready and on your guard with
respect to proper and honest answers in response to those
questions"and I think that that might be quite necessary
at that point to discuss, sir,
QUESTION:

But it comas down to consultation

relating to the cross-examination.

Now, I do not suggest by

that question that there is anything unethical about
consultations.
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
I am simply putting it to you, are you

saying that there! is a constitutional right to consult with
the defendant before the cross-examination begins relating
to the scope of the cross-examination?
MR. HONIG:
QUESTION:
MR. HONIG:

Providing -Just the scope.
Yes, your

Honor, providing that there

be a recess, yes? not if there was a continuum from direct
to cross-examination. I would admit that certainly he would
not have a right to consult with his client at that particular
time but if there is a recess and especially one that is
called or moved by the instance of the government., then,
certainly, he would have this right, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Then the constitutional right that

you are urging is one that depends on the fortuity of the
time of the day, the point in the trial when the direct

26
examination ends.
MR, HONIG:
this case that way,,

When — only because it happened in
But it would apply in any other

situation I would respectfully submit, Mr, Chief Justice,

any matter or discussing matters across the board with his

Mr, Chief Justice,

Let's assume —
Yes, let's assume for the moment that

the recess had taken place 10 or 15 minutes or half an hour

What, after the direct examination

of the defendant?
QUESTION:

You had just started the direct

examination and you planned to examine him for a day or two.
The recess occurs shortly after you have commenced.
MR. HONIG:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Overnight recess.

What is your

position on that?
MR, HONIG:

Oh, of course I would have a full

right to discuss and to consult with ray client during the
process of direct examination and in the overnight recess,
of course.
QUESTION:

Well, how would you limit your use of

the phrase, "critical stage in the trial"?
MR, HONIG:

I would say, your Honor, that a

critical stage of the proceedings is any stage wherein if
there is not assistance of counsel, accused may well be
denied or will not receive a fair trial and due process of
law,
QUESTION:

Aren't you really saying that any time

the court is in recess that defense counsel has the right to
confer with his client?
MR, HONIG;
QUESTION:

Yes, I am, your Honor.
So there is no significance, really,

to your talking about a critical stage.

MR. HONXG: I would submit that it is, Mr. Justice
Powell.
QUEST]!ON:

And yet, certainly the end of direct

for a defendant on the stand and the shift to cross, is, you
know, in the contemplation of most trial lawyers, a very
critical stage.
All of a sudden you stop getting questions from
the attorney that is friendly to you and you are getting
the questions from an attorney hostile to you and by your
definition if there is no recess at that point, that isn't a
critical stage of the trial.
MR. HONIG:

Well, every stage is a critical stage

of the proceedings.
QUESTION:

But you are not entitled to consult

with counsel at that stage, by your —
MR. HONIG:

Not at that stage, but if the trial

judge ordered the attorney out of the courtroom and said,
"Now, he’ll be cross-examined

without you being there," that

certainly would be the denial of the right of assistance of
counsel.
QUESTION:

If the trial judge simply says, "We

had a recess an hour and a half ago, no need for a recess now.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY GLAZER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GLAZER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
The issue

here is a narrow one, whether the

instruction that the District Judge gave without more
requires revers a1.

33

Petitioner's position is that this is error and is
error that can’t he harmless.
I think the place to start is on page 18 of the
Appendix just to look at exactly how this issue arose.

On

the bottom of page 18, defense counsel told the Court, "I
feel that I do not have the right to confer with him, my
client — I do have the right to confer with him but not to
coach him as to what he may say on cross-examination or how
to answer questions."
Thereafter, a little further down, the Court says,
"I think you might ask him

right now

— right here while

we are here — what witnesses he thinks you ought to call
in the morning.
"Let’s pat it this way.

You ask him right now if

he thinks that there are any witnesses you ought to call
during the evening.

If anything comes up after ha has been

cross-examined and after you have had an opportunity for
redirect, we would have a recess and you can have as much
time as you want to talk over trial strategy."
*

So this case really arises under circumstances
where counsel who is best familiar with the defendant has
said to the Court, "I really don’t want to talk to him about
his testimony at all.

All I want to talk to him about are

other matters," and the Court says, "Okay, if you want to
talk about other matters, that is fine.

You can talk to him

34
about other matters now an:l if you need extra time at the
conclusion of the direct examination — of the crossexamination,

I'll give yon additional time."
whi le
QUESTION:

going ahead without the recess.
MR. GLAZER:
QUESTION:

Well, I’ll —
So the

question about the judge’s

carrying the thing through, that is what he was getting
ready to do, wasn’t it?
MR., GLAZER:

The judge was getting ready to do

what?
QUESTION:

Continue with the cross-examination„

without the recess„
MR. GLAZER:
QUESTION:
MR. GLAZER;

The judge had originally said —
On the top of page 17.
Right.

On the bottom of page 16,

however, your Honor, the judge says, "Does the;Government
wish to proceed with its cross-examination now?

There are

reasons why you may or may not -- except for the time factor
I don’t know."
■

And 'one reason why the prosecution did not want to
proceed, it was already 4:55 and the normal time for
adjourning was 5:30.

If he had proceeded the result would

have been a recess during the cross-examination.

During the

35

next day, when the cross-examination commenced, it took the
entire morning.

I mean — it took the entire afternoon,

excuse me.
QUESTION:

Now, will you come back to this?

MR. GLASER:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
The record.

He says, "We would prefer

to recess"
The Court:

"AIL right, you may."

"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask you to
stay a reasonable time."
Which meant he was going to proceed.
And then the clerk said, "Oh, now, we don't want
that."
And couldn't it all have been solved if they had
gone along with it?

Couldn't it?

MR. GLAZER:

Yes, it could have been solved that

way, right.
QUESTION:

In other words, you don’t have to saw

the other way and gat the whole log.
MR. GLAZSR:

Weill, let me just put this case —

add some extra facts and put this in perspective, this whole
incident.
This trial covered a two-week span.

The

government completed its case and what the case was,
defendant was charged and convicted of conspiring to import

36

1,000 pounds of marijuana in the United States and his
defense was entrapment.
Nov;, the Government completed its case during
the first week of trial.

In fact, it completed its case on

a Thursday and the -- except for two witnesses who testified
the following week that the substance imported was marijuana.
At this point, on Thursday, the Court recessed and
so both the Government and defense counsel had Thursday night,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday to discuss their cases with
their witnesses.
Now, during the course of the presentation of the
case, the Court had instructed all of the Government
witnesses in the same fashion as it instructed the Defendant
here not to talk to lawyers during the recess.
Indeed, when the case commenced on the second
week, when there was a motion on behalf of Petitioner’s
attorney that the Government’s case agent, who had been
called as a defense witness should not be allowed to
participate in a prosecutorial conference and the Court said,
okay, if you don't want him to participate, I’ll instruct
%

him not to participate.
So, this was the way this case was handled.
sides were treated equally.

Both sides were not allowed to

discuss their testimony with their witnesses while *the
witnesses were on the stand.

Both

37
Now, the judge, even though he put this — put
counsel in a bind, so to speak, as to talking to the witnesses
overnight, however was very free and liberal in granting
recesses„
For example, during the afternoon before
Defendant commenced testimony he granted two recesses for
Defendant’s counsel.

One, to talk to a witness and, two,

he granted a recess -- a reces3 which I think is essential -the defense counsel said, 'I'd like to talk to my client now
that the Government's case is closed so that we can make the
decision as to whether he is going to take the stand and
testify."
So the judge said, "Fine, we’ll grant you another
recess to make that decision."
Now, subsequently, after the defense finished —
after the Government finished its redirect examination of the
Defendant, there was another recess.
There was another recess and that is on page 22 of
the Appendix which we think is significant to show that we
don't have an arbitrary judge here,
Between — when the Government completed its
cross-examination it was time for a luncheon break.

At that

point the Court said to the defense counsel, "I am going to
instruct your client not to talk to you during the luncheon
break."

38

At this point, counsel said, "Your Honor, I know"-this is on page 22 -- ”1 know of no way that I can properly
examine my client on redirect examination unless I talk to
him about the cross-examination and about other factors
pertaining to the case."
So the Court says, "All right, you can go ahead
and talk to him."
So what you really have here is a situation just,
as far as wa are concerned,, like Leighton versus the United
States,
'
“

the Second Circuit case in which I think you could
•

say that all counsel was doing here was trying to sow

error

into the record.
If he had presse>d, if counsel had pressed at the
conclusion between direct and cross and said, "I want to
talk to my client.

I want to talk to him about potential

questions on cross-examination, there is every reason to
believe that the trial judge would have done the same thing
as he did between the cross and redirect.
Now, concededly, assistance of counsel requires
consultation and preparation.

Counsel normally prepares the

case before trial and it is often necessary --- not only you
can't complete the preparation of your case before trial
because many things happen

unexpectedly so you do have to

prepare for — make your case while your case is proceeding
and this requires you to make use of recesses, no question

39

about that.
But when counsel
don't want a recess.

and counsel as here says, "I

X don’t want the recess to talk to my

client about his testimony," I think the Court is entitled to
take him at face value.
QUESTION:

What is the Government’s position,

Mr. Glaser, if the client — if the lawyer had said, "I do
want the recess to talk to my client about his testimony"?
MR,, GLASER:

Well, it is our position if he had

said that, we would take the position he should have the
right to talk to the client about his testimony.
The reason we do is illustrated by this case.
What would occur if there was a denial would be a claim that
there was a denial of effective assistance of counsel and it
would be difficult for the Government to rebut whether or not
the counsel had something that occurred which required a
recess at that time.
After all, there is the lawyer-client privileged
relationship and there would be no way to rebut something
like that.

That is why we don’t say that this is a practice

which should ordinarily follow because it does create these
types of problems but when you have a situation where counsel
says, like here, "I don’t want to talk to my client about his
testimony," that is a unique situation and we think there is
no violation of his assistance to counsel in that situation

and there is no harm»
Now, of course, when a defendant testifies, he
subjects himself to restrictions just like any other witness.
Under our adversary system, he is not entitled to
a recess just because an embarassing question is asked.

The

jury is entitled to hear his testimony and decide on the
basis of his personal responses and not the responses of his
lawyer so the jury can determine his demeanor and make its
own appraisal of whether or not he is a credible witness or
not a credible witness.
QUESTION:

Now --

Now, sometimes a witness is being

cross-examined, as is not unusual, for three, four, five, six
days.

Do you think the Court could say that during the time

the cross-examination is continuing you may not consult?
MR. GLAZER:
reasonable restriction.

Oh, yes, we think that it is a
The only reason we say that ordin­

arily it should not be done when vou have a defendant is
because you create these problems which sometimes could arise
even in a post-conviction proceeding in

which there could be

a claim — well, there was really something very essential
that we had to talk about and you denied us

a right to talk

and so therefore the case should be reversed because the
defendant has been denied the effective assistance of counsel.
That is why we don’t think this is a — this
procedure should routinely be followed.

It just happens in

41
this case uniquely that the lawyer — most lawyers would not
say this.

Most lawyers world say, "Well, yes, your Honor,"

just like this lawyer here said on redirect, "I can't — 1
want to talk to the client.

cross-examination,

MR„ GLAZER:

Well, the order may be constitu­

tionally all right — let ms just back up»
constitutionally all right,

The order may be

I just don’t think it is

appropriate procedure»
The reason why it may be constitutionally all right
is because you certainly could have gone forward.

You could

have gone forward and tried the entire case without any
recesses and that is what occurs in many short cases.

The

defendant gets on and testifies and right after he testifies
on direct, he goes ahead with his cross and if he asks for
recess, the judge can say,

"Qh, you don't need a recess» Let's:

finish it."1
So X don’t say there is anything constitutionally

wrong with — maybe I just misunderstood Justice White's
question ■— X don't sea that there is anything constitu­
tionally wrong with that.
it is a good practice.

What I am saying is, I don't think

It is not a good practice because

afterwards, afterwards, in the event there is a conviction,
you are going to get the claim that, oh, you didn't let me
talk to my client about his cross-examination and there was
really something I should have talked to him about and this
something occurred because of some sort of surprise.
But apart from — in addition to that —
QUESTION:

You couldn't raise that kind of a

claim unless you could show a constitutional violation, I
would think.
MR. GLASER:

Well, you could show it.

maybe you could come up with something.

Well,

Be may be able to

come up with
QUESTION:

But if you cars come up with something

on the habeas, you can come up with something in the direct,
I would think.
MR. GLASER:

Well, you — yes, you could.

But

usually if you came up with something during the course of
the trial the

chances are the trial court would try to right
*

it at that particular point.

So usually nothing would occur

until the conclusion of the trial.
At that point there would be some second-guessing

45
and then defense counsel, or there would be a new lawyer
would enter the case and then the claim would be made.
QUESTION:

Well, is it not common, if a judge, a

trial judge has or thinks he has reason to doubt whether a
witness is going to be improperly coached that he will say
that we will not begin the direct examination until the
beginning of the court session in some way that he can
plan it out.

Isn't that a common thing for judges to do?

MR. GLAEERs

I am sure that occurs, your Honor.

I

don't know how common it is.
QUESTION:

Just as it is probably quite common,

for defense counsel putting a witness on the stand to try
to have it fall so that he will have a recess to talk to the
client.
MR. GLAZER:

Oh, I am sure, there is no question -■

on the latter statement there is no question in my mind that
when counsel put 'witnesses on to testify they certainly are
cognizant and they consider when the recesses are going to
occur because some of them want to —QUESTION:

Isn't it also true that if he has a

suspicion he won't get a recess he'll let you go through till
9:00, 10:00 o'clock at night?
MR. GLAZER:

Well, the only trouble with that is,

the country judges do it but the city judges don't. I have
never seen a city judge —

46
QUESTION:

Well, this judge was getting ready

to go.
MR. GLAZER:
QUESTION:

Right.

Right, but he was —

He was a city judge, wasn't he?

MR. GLAZER:

Right.

Right.

He was willing to

do it.
QUESTION:

He was willing to go ahead.

MR. GLAZER:

But apparently neither counsel

wanted to because the defease counsel didn’t protest about
the recess.

The defense counsel didn't say to him —
QUESTION:

No, he protested about the terras of

the recess.
MR. GLAZER:
QUESTION:

Well, he protested —
Right.

MR. GLAZER:

— about the terms of the recess but

he didn't say to the judge, ’’Look, this is going to let the
government think about, cross-examination overnight and we are
not going to be able to think about it.”
He doesn’t --

he didn’t —• if he had protested

that way, I think the judge would have gone forward.
QUESTION:
MR. GLAZER:

How in the world can you assume that?
Well, I ju3t — fx*orn reading the

record, your Honor ■— from reading the record it seems to me
that the judge was trying to be evenhanded but whan counsel
said to the judge, ’’Look, I do not want to talk to him about

47
his testimony, all I want to talk to him about is what
witnesses to call," and tha Court said, "Okay.

You can .

talk to him about what witnesses you can call.

You can

talk to him right now and in addition, if you need additional
time, you can talk to him Later.'1
So I think we have a judge who was trying to be
evenhanded, both to the prosecution and to the defense.
Now, we think that if this is error, that this is
not the type of error which is in subject to the harmless
error rule and we think that in this case, if you examine all
the circumstances -- and I'll recite them briefly -— if they
were there, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
In the first place, the limitation here, the
restriction here, i3 not akin to the denial of somebody

the

right of a lawyer at all.
Certainly, in those cases where a defendant hasn't
waived his right to a lawyer, the court will not look and
decide whether he has been prejudiced or not.
Here, the limitation that the court placed on the
overnight recess is not significantly different from the
short trial where the defendant's testimony may go forward,
from commencement to conclusion covering direct and cross
without any recess.
To the extent that a recess might have
significance or make a difference, then it may be used in

48

trial preparation.
There was no harm here because counsel said he
didn't need the recess for,, to talk to his client about his
cross-examination and as far as other matters are concerned,
the Court gave defense counsel opportunity at the beginning
of the recess and later on to discuss trial strategy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Slater, actually# on page 18 of

the appendix# as I read what counsel said# at the bottom
of page 13# "I feel that I do have the right to confer with
him but not to coach him as to what he may say oh crossexamination or how to answer questions."
Now, that is a little bit differant# I would
think# than you put if,
MR. GLAZER:

Yea# but I thought the import of

the remark was — but then# when the — but then# the
reason we took this# we interpreted it slightly different
is -- is when the counsel 3ays to the Court he has some
questions about trial# he has some matters of trial stra­
tegy# he only — so the Court says to counsel# "What matters
are those?" and he says# "Well#

£

might want to talk to him

about what witnesses to call" and from that 1 think you
can infer that he didn't want to talk to him about his
trial testimony and otherwise that would have been fore­
most in his mind.
In addition# we think the Court should# in

49

deciding that if it was

error, it was harmless error,

lock to the fact that here we have -- we don’t have a
situation where we have a reluctant counsel who is
impressing things for the — on behalf of his client.
Here, when counsel was not reluctant to
express his needs, when he thought he had to talk to the
defendant about his testimony, as he did before redirect
examination and if he had a need. Justice Relinquish, to
discuss any testimony as to what his testimony would be in
cross, I think he would have done the same thing at this
recess as he did in the subsequent recess which occurred
the following day at the luncheon time.
Finally, we have a case where we have a Court
which had concern that the defendant have a fair, trial.
The Court freely granted recess just before
the defendant testified»

He gave a recess to the defense

to talk to a defense witness.

!■

Thereafter, shortly thereafter, counsel said,
"I would like time to talk to my defendant to decide whether
the defendant should testify.18
At that point the counsel was given another
recess.
Finally, the restrictions imposed were not
one-sided.
